      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>One more thing--</li>
      <li>Good stuff, big hair, great for updo&#x27;s</li>
      <li>My hairstylist introduced this product to me many months ago.</li>
      <li>I used it all up and ordered more here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I really like this product, just don&#x27;t really love how it leaves my hair feeling grimy, but I guess that&#x27;s how it works and gets the volume pumped!?! :)</li>
      <li>It does change the texture, but that&#x27;s fine with me, because my styling looks better and lasts longer.</li>
      <li>but I got it very quickly.</li>
      <li>Since it&#x27;s layered, the product works fine.</li>
      <li>Delivered quick love the product I originally got this for my daughter</li>
      <li>Just added some lightly to my roots after pre-styling my hair.  </li>
      <li>I love this product so much, it is one of my three favorite products I use all the time.</li>
      <li>Totally worth it!</li>
      <li>might use this if I only have to look good for a couple hours and won&#x27;t have anybody else touch my hair.</li>
      <li>my grandaughter and i both use this... gives your hair more body and lift and makes it much easier to style.</li>
      <li>Also, package came quickly.</li>
      <li>Smells nice, gives hair nice volume and texture, doesn&#x27;t feel clumpy or heavy.</li>
      <li>it worked better for me than Big Sexy Hair.</li>
      <li>it works great and allows me to use less sp</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and this  really did the trick...</li>
      <li>My fine hair looks so much fuller now</li>
      <li>Overall, I am pleased with this product and will continue using.</li>
      <li>The powder changes the texture of your hair, making it more coarse, making it plumper.</li>
      <li>It really works!</li>
      <li>More of that tousled just left the salon look.  </li>
      <li>Also there&#x27;s much more of it than in the Big Fat Hair brand.</li>
      <li>It made my hair look like I just washed and dried it plus way more volume!</li>
      <li>I use it for volume in my short and fine hair and like it.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have to use as much hairspray or anything to try to get that fuller look</li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>Works great if you have thin hair and want to add some volume.</li>
      <li>and I am really amazed at it.</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m wearing it a bit less than chin length around my face, and a good bit shorter in the back</li>
      <li>I was looking for a cheaper replacement for the same product from the Big Sexy Hair line</li>
      <li>I add just a little each morning and it makes my hair a fluffier on top.</li>
      <li>Worth the investment in such a &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; bottle.</li>
      <li>I love it for long lasting effects.</li>
      <li>It immediately melted into my cool, dry fingers.</li>
      <li>Seems to work best on freshly-shampooed, dry hair, but I have used it before after a few days of no shampoo (in the winter especially I try not to shampoo every day, usually a vigorous water wash or sometimes baking soda/apple cider vinegar routine) and it&#x27;s worked fine, just not as well and not for as long.</li>
      <li>and she told me that she just runs her hands through her hair and messes it up a little to reactivate, for lack of a better word, the powder and get the volume back.</li>
      <li>So shaking it out directly onto my hair and scalp</li>
      <li>All I can say is WOW.</li>
      <li>I recommend this for anyone with thin hair or who just wants to give it more volume without the stickiness of hairspray and the lack of hold hairspray has.</li>
      <li>I have baby-fine hair that&#x27;s limp on its own, no matter how short or long I wear it.</li>
      <li>This really gives my fine thin hair volume.</li>
      <li>Throughout the day, I can just take my fingers a fluff it again and it is right back where is was.</li>
      <li>Just shake the powder onto your roots then rub it in with your hands, you can bend over and mess with it upside down for even more volume.</li>
      <li>Normally I can go several days without needing to wash my hair, but I could only go two days after putting this in because it smelled sweaty and oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> My only complaint would be that my hair isn&#x27;t has soft once I use this at my roots.</li>
<li> So not much control.</li>
<li> It is stiff and feels gross, and when it gets on your hair, I don&#x27;t like the smell.  </li>
<li> I highly recommend this to anyone who hates washing their hair daily but doesn&#x27;t want dirty looking hair, people who struggle with getting volume in their hair, or people who are just looking for extra volume!</li>
<li> I put a VERY small amount in 2 day unwashed hair just to see how it would do and WOW.</li>
<li> I agree with the other 5 star reviews.  </li>
<li> (I wash it every other day).  </li>
<li> it gives you volume without that greasy feeling that some of the other products does.</li>
<li> I just fluff it up during the day and that&#x27;s all I need!</li>
<li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed :)</li>
<li> Holy cow!  </li>
<li> A FEW HOURS LATER.&lt;br /&gt;SMELLS</li>
<li> I used it when my hair was limp after not washing for 2 - 3 days.</li>
<li> The smell is awful, very strong deodorizing floral, which reminded me of the scented (I can&#x27;t find unscented)</li>
<li> A little dab will do ya!</li>
<li> Not sure that I care for the smell.</li>
<li> The bottle is small but it takes a very, very small amount for results.</li>
<li> I have very thick heavy medium length hair.  </li>
<li> My hair stylist has short hair and she uses it to get crazy volume</li>
<li> Keeps my hair from going flat, even on muggy days.</li>
<li> When I came across this while looking for volumizing products, I was a little skeptical.</li>
<li> It also seemed to make my hair smell worse...</li>
<li> It is also a VERY small bottle!</li>
<li> ...only use a very small amount!!</li>
<li> I have very thin hair and have tried everything to give it some volume.</li>
<li> My hair wasn&#x27;t dirty, but after I used this it felt that way.  </li>
<li> Makes your hair feel very dirty.  </li>

    <li> I really like this product.  I have very thick heavy medium length hair.  It gives me extra lift where needed.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> It really works! My hairdresser had used it on me and i went home and ordered it. Works great if you have thin hair and want to add some volume. Don&#x27;t be scared it is white powder but it disappears. :)</li>
    <li> This really gives my fine thin hair volume.</li>
    <li> This hair powder is pretty good!  I use it for volume in my short and fine hair and like it.  I was looking for a cheaper replacement for the same product from the Big Sexy Hair line and I think this one is a winner!</li>
    <li> It is not a miracle worker by an means. I used it when my hair was limp after not washing for 2 - 3 days. My hair wasn&#x27;t dirty, but after I used this it felt that way.  Putting it on my fingers, as one commenter suggested, and then rubbing it through my hair didn&#x27;t work. It immediately melted into my cool, dry fingers. So shaking it out directly onto my hair and scalp did work, then running my fingers through. However, it makes my hair feel very dirty, and makes my scalp itch. My hair also decides on its own which way it&#x27;s going to go, and it may not be the direction it seems that it should having put this on it. So not much control. The smell is awful, very strong deodorizing floral, which reminded me of the scented (I can&#x27;t find unscented) Always Radiant Infinity pads.  I would not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> love this stuff! I am a grandma with short haircut. I have no lift on top but this product solves my problem. A little dab will do ya!</li>
    <li> This product gives great lift to your hair! I bought it for my sister and myself and we both love it!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite hair products! It&#x27;s better the. Hairspray! I love it for long lasting effects.</li>
    <li> Kind of a joke for a product</li>
    <li> Good stuff, big hair, great for updo&#x27;s</li>
    <li> When I came across this while looking for volumizing products, I was a little skeptical. A powder that adds volume? After reading reviews I knew I had to try it for myself. All I can say is WOW. This stuff is like fairy dust! I put a VERY small amount in 2 day unwashed hair just to see how it would do and WOW. It made my hair look like I just washed and dried it plus way more volume! The bottle is small but it takes a very, very small amount for results. I highly recommend this to anyone who hates washing their hair daily but doesn&#x27;t want dirty looking hair, people who struggle with getting volume in their hair, or people who are just looking for extra volume! You won&#x27;t be disappointed :)</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this  really did the trick...i can blend my hair with clip in extensions....they cant be seen and they stay in place all day....i have used oribe and it does not compare it results.</li>
    <li> I have baby-fine hair that&#x27;s limp on its own, no matter how short or long I wear it. My hairstylist introduced this product to me many months ago. It&#x27;s the best volumizer I have ever used. I will say that the shorter I wear my hair, and the more layers I have, the better it works. Now I&#x27;m wearing it a bit less than chin length around my face, and a good bit shorter in the back (the cut angles from front to back). Since it&#x27;s layered, the product works fine. It does change the texture, but that&#x27;s fine with me, because my styling looks better and lasts longer. One more thing--it worked better for me than Big Sexy Hair.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! My fine hair looks so much fuller now and I don&#x27;t have to use as much hairspray or anything to try to get that fuller look I wanted! I just fluff it up during the day and that&#x27;s all I need!</li>
    <li> my grandaughter and i both use this... gives your hair more body and lift and makes it much easier to style. love.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Keeps my hair from going flat, even on muggy days.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about one week now and I am really amazed at it. I add just a little each morning and it makes my hair a fluffier on top. Throughout the day, I can just take my fingers a fluff it again and it is right back where is was. Overall, I am pleased with this product and will continue using.</li>
    <li> MAKES MY HAIR STINK A FEW HOURS LATER.&lt;br /&gt;SMELLS GREAT AT FIRST</li>
    <li> I do not like this.  It is stiff and feels gross, and when it gets on your hair, I don&#x27;t like the smell.  It is also a VERY small bottle!</li>
    <li> This stuff will give your hair tons of volume! It lasts forever too because you only need a tiny bit to get big results. My only complaint would be that my hair isn&#x27;t has soft once I use this at my roots. It adds a ton of texture and body to my hair. The volume last all day too. I wish I had know about it sooner.</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair and have tried everything to give it some volume. My hair stylist tried this product on me then just gave me the rest of the bottle. I used it all up and ordered more here on Amazon. I love this product so much, it is one of my three favorite products I use all the time. Just shake the powder onto your roots then rub it in with your hands, you can bend over and mess with it upside down for even more volume. The powder changes the texture of your hair, making it more coarse, making it plumper. My hair stylist has short hair and she uses it to get crazy volume and she told me that she just runs her hands through her hair and messes it up a little to reactivate, for lack of a better word, the powder and get the volume back. I recommend this for anyone with thin hair or who just wants to give it more volume without the stickiness of hairspray and the lack of hold hairspray has. Also, package came quickly.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing and one bottle has lasted over six months! Worth the investment in such a &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; bottle.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other 5 star reviews.  I used it this morning on unwashed hair (I wash it every other day).  Just added some lightly to my roots after pre-styling my hair.  Holy cow!  Volume was amazing and I didn&#x27;t have a greasy look or feel.  More of that tousled just left the salon look.  Love it and ordering more to keep in my purse!!</li>
    <li> I applied this to my roots and got some volume and texture, but it didn&#x27;t last long. The product stayed in my hair after rinsing once. You can definitely tell that there&#x27;s product in your hair when you run your fingers through it - it&#x27;s tacky and catches on your fingers. It also seemed to make my hair smell worse...Normally I can go several days without needing to wash my hair, but I could only go two days after putting this in because it smelled sweaty and oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might use this if I only have to look good for a couple hours and won&#x27;t have anybody else touch my hair.</li>
    <li> If you can shake out just the right amount, it gives great volume. Not sure that I care for the smell.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle....it gives you volume without that greasy feeling that some of the other products does. Beware tho...only use a very small amount!! My daughter is almost through in cosmetology school and used some and thought it was a great product. She ended up ordering 3 more.&lt;br /&gt;Wasn&#x27;t shipped from Amazon, but I got it very quickly.</li>
    <li> Love the stuff! It is by far the best volumising product I have ever found for my hair. Leaves my hair feeling a bit like I haven&#x27;t watched it in a month but, I still give it a 5 star rating on the left. Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> Makes your hair feel very dirty.  It is okay, but I feel like I need to wash my hair the day I use it.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, gives hair nice volume and texture, doesn&#x27;t feel clumpy or heavy. Seems to work best on freshly-shampooed, dry hair, but I have used it before after a few days of no shampoo (in the winter especially I try not to shampoo every day, usually a vigorous water wash or sometimes baking soda/apple cider vinegar routine) and it&#x27;s worked fine, just not as well and not for as long. Also there&#x27;s much more of it than in the Big Fat Hair brand.</li>
