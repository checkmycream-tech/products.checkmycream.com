      <li>This stuff is AMAZING!</li>
      <li>I have been using these Phytoceramides for over a year now and they are remarkable.</li>
      <li>if it is this good now cant wait to see the difference in 6 months time.</li>
      <li>and they do work, everybody is commenting on how good my skin looks.</li>
      <li>I tried to check the truthfulness of the ingredients used and I found out that they were actually good for me.</li>
      <li>I will give it a good test.</li>
      <li>~ Because, I thought I was ordering Phytoceramides that are Gluten Free..!!</li>
      <li>I am sure this is a good product just not for me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nice difference in my face.  </li>
      <li>I honestly dont see any difference</li>
      <li>and I honestly can&#x27;t see any difference in my face.</li>
      <li>and it’s full of great vitamins.</li>
      <li>I was wishing more of the lines around my mouth would diminish.</li>
      <li>Looking in the mirror, I think it looks better</li>
      <li>I have tried many products in skin rejuvenation.  </li>
      <li>I love Dr. Oz TV show</li>
      <li>Though bought this for my face, all my skin feels better moisturized, my husband felt the benefits within days.</li>
      <li>satisfied with purchase will buy again</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Maybe because you need to buy more then one I don&#x27;t know.</li>
      <li>These were tearing my gut up until I read the label more closely, and saw the allergy warning.</li>
      <li>but it’s actually healthy for me as well as helpful.</li>
      <li>I have noticed that my 11 lines on my forehead had  diminished a bit, actually more than a bit.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I tried it.</li>
      <li>Not so sure this works yet,</li>
      <li>More lines are fading.</li>
      <li>This really is a magical pill, my wife and I both never thought it would have results like this.  </li>
      <li>I tried it and it gave me more confidence.</li>
      <li>I have had done\\&quot;, because I really looked great - (nothing else had changed)</li>
      <li>However, these may work perfectly well for someone who is not sensitive to Gluten...</li>
      <li>Vitamins are good for you in any case and I will keep taking them as well, besides the placebo effect is probably more effective than what is actually inside any pill.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Easy to take.</li>
      <li>for example, fine lines around the mouth, diminished.</li>
      <li>Those areas have greatly improved with some being entirely gone.</li>
      <li>sure I was right.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth a try!</li>
      <li>Be patient, it is worth it!</li>
      <li>but it was about the 1 month mark when the results started to show significantly.  </li>
      <li>This just didn&#x27;t do anything special for me.</li>
      <li>cause all my face looks different for good</li>
      <li>so that&#x27;s good enough for me....</li>
      <li>The one thing going for it is it has good vitamins that we need daily, so</li>
      <li>I am 62 and since using this product along with good skin care, my skin is softer and smoother than women much younger....</li>
      <li>Well, after only 7 weeks my under-eyes are gorgeous...</li>
      <li>and I have used one full bottle.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll admit that Im a beauty fanatic, and always looking for the best makeup, lotion, and skin care products.</li>
      <li>Love these capsules and it took a month for the difference to really show.  </li>
      <li>I will continue using it for the full month to see if anything becomes noticeable.  </li>
      <li>think Dr. Oz is full of sh</li>
      <li>Now I am enjoying myself together with my family having fun playing under the sun without worrying too much of my skin getting damaged.</li>
      <li>and like what I see, fine lines and wrinkles, some diminishing, more plump due to better hydration.</li>
      <li>In fact, I still want to try the protocol so much that I just ordered three bottles of &#x27;Gluten Free&#x27; Phytoceramides...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m already getting compliments on how much better my skin looks and how young I look.</li>
      <li>I ordered 6 months worth have been taking three months, i see no difference, will continue to take remaining.  </li>
      <li>We first heard about the product from Dr. Oz and we decided to try it trying to protect our &amp;#34;money maker&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to others interested in this product.</li>
      <li>i believe by using phyto-renew will only improve my face even more.</li>
      <li>This combined with my balanced diet and so far I can say that my everyone has been complementing on how fabulous I look.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that this product isn&#x27;t just a bunch of chemicals, and that it works from the inside out, rather than having to smear something all over my face and neck that never seems to totally absorb into my skin.</li>
      <li>And results are visible after first month.</li>
      <li>I had a big frown line on my brow that has been there for many years.</li>
      <li>No were near as hood as name brand!!!!</li>
      <li>but so far I am not disappointed.</li>
      <li>Before using the product, my face was still looking pretty good for my age, but I hated the way the lines around my eyes kept getting more and more distinct, even when I wasn&#x27;t smiling!</li>
      <li>Honestly after using this product for a month on a daily basis as directed I could not see any improvement in my skin, maybe over time u might see slight gradual results but for the most part skip this one</li>
      <li>I didn’t have to spend a lot in the first place and it started working so fast after I got it.</li>
      <li>I originally bought these from a different site, but now that I&#x27;ve found them here at a much better price, this is where I will be receiving my next order from.</li>
      <li>haha.  </li>
      <li>Really like this product does what it says.  </li>
      <li>cant really tell if it works or not,  so I wont buy it again</li>
      <li>but I think I am really going to like it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Believe you will see your wrinkles disappear over night and..... who knows that you really will...</li>
      <li>I saw no difference after using the whole bottle.</li>
      <li>Maybe it is just a placebo effect, but I do think they help (but don&#x27;t believe anything in a bottle is really a miracle product).  </li>
      <li>Fast</li>
      <li>Delivery fast, I am taking it</li>
      <li>and I wonder how much he gets to make us buy all these</li>
      <li>so maybe it really does help.  </li>
      <li>phtyocermides - WOW!!!</li>
      <li>My skin seems considerably less dry, more smooth, better toned and overall younger.  </li>
      <li>I have 2 pills left to take from my very first bottle.</li>
      <li>I would indeed recommend this to anyone who wants to feel young again.</li>
      <li>After nearly one month I do not see any change, but since I ordered a few more months supply I&#x27;m hoping to see a difference at the end of that time.</li>
      <li>I am very surprised something ingested can be marketed this way.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 52 year old guy</li>
      <li>After one week of use, I really can&#x27;t see any results or anything different in my skin.  </li>
      <li>to early to tell but not upset with my purchase!&lt;br</li>
      <li>AND SO FAR  </li>
      <li>I like the product, the cost is reasonable, and I have seen results after several weeks of use.</li>
      <li>This product by far gives you youthful features.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> cant really tell if it works or not,  so I wont buy it again</li>
    <li> Perfect, as always.  Am repeat buyer.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;exactly as expected.&lt;br /&gt;happy with the product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper than buying from the dr. oz show!!!</li>
    <li> The jury is still out on this product.  The one thing going for it is it has good vitamins that we need daily, so, I guess you could say it&#x27;s O.K.</li>
    <li> I am highly against plastic surgeries and I prefer to try natural products that can help me look younger. But also I do not have money for expensive cosmetic treatments. I love Dr. Oz TV show and I trust him, so when I heard recommendation about this product I bought it. And results are visible after first month. My skin looks fresh, younger and finally hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with PhytoRenew 350 Phytoceramides.</li>
    <li> I have been using these Phytoceramides for over a year now and they are remarkable. I had a big frown line on my brow that has been there for many years. It is hardly noticeable now!!!! I am 62 and since using this product along with good skin care, my skin is softer and smoother than women much younger....</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product it takes a month to see the results but it does work.  We just made our second purchase</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase. Only been using for a week but i can tell i slight difference in my skin. Can&#x27;t wait to see what the results will be at 1 month.</li>
    <li> i have been taking these capsules for 3 weeks now and the difference is unbelievable, this is not a scam and they do work, everybody is commenting on how good my skin looks. my 2 sisters have also now started taking it and they also have experienced great improvement in their skin. if it is this good now cant wait to see the difference in 6 months time. money well spent</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few months, and it has made a tremendous difference in the way my skin looks. Before using the product, my face was still looking pretty good for my age, but I hated the way the lines around my eyes kept getting more and more distinct, even when I wasn&#x27;t smiling! After a few weeks, I could see the lines were fading and some of my friends were starting to question what I&#x27;d done. I love the fact that this product isn&#x27;t just a bunch of chemicals, and that it works from the inside out, rather than having to smear something all over my face and neck that never seems to totally absorb into my skin. I originally bought these from a different site, but now that I&#x27;ve found them here at a much better price, this is where I will be receiving my next order from. You won&#x27;t get instant results, but you will get results!</li>
    <li> Honestly after using this product for a month on a daily basis as directed I could not see any improvement in my skin, maybe over time u might see slight gradual results but for the most part skip this one</li>
    <li> This just didn&#x27;t do anything special for me. If I had stayed one it for several months maybe it would have but ....</li>
    <li> Even though I&#x27;m not that old yet my skin is already starting to show signs of age. In fact, it’s already starting to show wrinkles and lines that make me look much older than I actually am. I decided to try out PhytoRenew 350 because I saw it on Dr. Oz. I know it seems awful to try a product because you see it on TV but I had to do something. I really hate looking old when I&#x27;m not. So I gave it a try and I was amazed at the results. I didn’t have to spend a lot in the first place and it started working so fast after I got it. Not only that but it’s actually healthy for me as well as helpful. I&#x27;m always concerned about taking chemicals but this is made of veggies and it’s full of great vitamins. I&#x27;m so glad that I tried it. I&#x27;m already getting compliments on how much better my skin looks and how young I look.</li>
    <li> This was like taking a sugar pill. It did nothing for me . My skin was the same when I finished the last pill. Will not take again.</li>
    <li> I like the product, the cost is reasonable, and I have seen results after several weeks of use. I would recommend this to others interested in this product.</li>
    <li> After nearly one month I do not see any change, but since I ordered a few more months supply I&#x27;m hoping to see a difference at the end of that time. I was wishing more of the lines around my mouth would diminish. Hoping the ads are truthful and will be totally annoyed if it&#x27;s a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> I am DEAD SERIOUS!!!  I&#x27;m a 52 year old guy and I had horrible, puffy, saggy, baggy skin under my eyes and looked like an old hound dog.  I recently went to 4 different plastic surgeons asking for HELP.  No One could help.  VERY FRUSTRATED, then i saw this review on the internet about these magical pills  &amp;#34;a face-lift-in a bottle&#x27;  Well, after only 7 weeks my under-eyes are gorgeous...they puffed me back to normal and i guess the collagen underneath has RESTORED my face and has taken 10 years off my age!!  I get compliments ALL THE TIME and people asking me if i had &#x27;work done&amp;#34;  my children and family were AMAZED.  I cannot say enough about tis product and will use it until i die....OH, no noticeable side-effects either.  THANK YOU phtyocermides - WOW!!!</li>
    <li> Really like this product does what it says.  I just just found it cheaper on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Have used it for 3 weeks and no noticeable difference. It doesn&#x27;t work. Will be returning the unused portions.</li>
    <li> Love these capsules and it took a month for the difference to really show.  Nice difference in my face.  Best price on Amazon too.</li>
    <li> I ordered 6 months worth have been taking three months, i see no difference, will continue to take remaining.  But think it is a waste of money.  I have tried many products in skin rejuvenation.  Will not order again.</li>
    <li> I have 2 pills left to take from my very first bottle. I do see a slight improvement in wrinkles on my forehead and around my eyes. It has cleared up the red scars I had left behind from acne. I&#x27;m going to try another month out.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is just my mind talking myself into this product working or what, but it does seem to be helping my skin.  This is my second bottle.  I take multivitamins and Biotin too, but it all seems to be working together, so I&#x27;ll keep using this product for a while longer.</li>
    <li> I have a problem, and I don&#x27;t know how to resolve it other than give 2 bottles and the remainder of one to someone else. ~ Because, I thought I was ordering Phytoceramides that are Gluten Free..!! These were tearing my gut up until I read the label more closely, and saw the allergy warning. They contain &#x27;wheat&#x27;... However, these may work perfectly well for someone who is not sensitive to Gluten... In fact, I still want to try the protocol so much that I just ordered three bottles of &#x27;Gluten Free&#x27; Phytoceramides...</li>
    <li> Delivery fast, I am taking it</li>
    <li> My wife and I started using Maritz Mayer Phytoceramides about 2 months ago, I have to say during the first few weeks I was very skeptical but it was about the 1 month mark when the results started to show significantly.  This really is a magical pill, my wife and I both never thought it would have results like this.  We first heard about the product from Dr. Oz and we decided to try it trying to protect our &amp;#34;money maker&amp;#34; haha.  We highly recommend this product since it has firmed our jawlines and over skin on our faces and we are noticing less wrinkle lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no need to buy the expensive other brands as Maritz Mayer Laboratories&#x27; brand and those are all possibly coming from the same factory but just packaged differently.</li>
    <li> I saw no difference after using the whole bottle.</li>
    <li> I have been using for about 6 months.  Maybe it is just a placebo effect, but I do think they help (but don&#x27;t believe anything in a bottle is really a miracle product).  My skin seems considerably less dry, more smooth, better toned and overall younger.  Recently a friend whom I haven&#x27;t seen in a year asked me specifically \\&quot;what I have had done\\&quot;, because I really looked great - (nothing else had changed) so maybe it really does help.  Looking in the mirror, I think it looks better so that&#x27;s good enough for me....and I do tend to be a skeptic about anything like this.</li>
    <li> I have not used the product long enough to give it five stars but I think I am really going to like it.  There is no overnight change, but I do see subtle differences which should become more pronounced over time.  Definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months and I honestly can&#x27;t see any difference in my face. I wish I could say I look 10 years younger.... I would be even happy with 5 LOL&lt;br /&gt;I think Dr. Oz is full of sh** and I wonder how much he gets to make us buy all these useless pills.&lt;br /&gt;However, I am not saying you shouldn&#x27;t buy or take these pills. Vitamins are good for you in any case and I will keep taking them as well, besides the placebo effect is probably more effective than what is actually inside any pill.&lt;br /&gt;Believe you will see your wrinkles disappear over night and..... who knows that you really will...</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference and I have used one full bottle.  Starting on another and hope to see some changes.</li>
    <li> No were near as hood as name brand!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m never going to try anything that Dr Oz promotes again. I&#x27;ve been 100% dissatisfied with everything I&#x27;ve tried from his suggestions. He&#x27;s not a doctor, he&#x27;s just an endorser!</li>
    <li> Great product.  I can see a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I AM THE SECOND BOTTLE AND SO FAR  NO RESULTS. I WILL CCONTINUE TO USE IT UP AND LET YOU KNOW IF IT WORKS.</li>
    <li> After one week of use, I really can&#x27;t see any results or anything different in my skin.  I will continue using it for the full month to see if anything becomes noticeable.  At the moment, I find it a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  I went back to the brand I was using before this one.  It may do great for others.</li>
    <li> My skin looks refreshed.</li>
    <li> Still trying the product I have seen any changes yet</li>
    <li> I like this product. I could see a difference in my face within a week. The pills are smaller than the average vitamin pill, making it easy to swallow. Another plus was the lack of yucky vitamin taste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still taking the product, but honestly no change yet.  It could be because I am 70+ now and it might take longer.  I&#x27;m not discouraged and I actually ordered another supply.  I will give it a good test.</li>
    <li> it was almost the same product i was using but, it had vitamin e added, how great was that!  i&#x27;ve been using the phyto-renew for four months, it realy has worked for me. for example, fine lines around the mouth, diminished. the jowel under the chin less noticable. i believe by using phyto-renew will only improve my face even more. i am totally a fan</li>
    <li> may work for some...any improvements too minor to notice by self or others</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit that Im a beauty fanatic, and always looking for the best makeup, lotion, and skin care products. This product by far gives you youthful features. This combined with my balanced diet and so far I can say that my everyone has been complementing on how fabulous I look. I would indeed recommend this to anyone who wants to feel young again.</li>
    <li> Just  saw Dr. Oz saying he does not nor has he ever endorse or advertised to use this product. I am sending him a bottle  for him to test along with the website  because he hates people that say their product &amp;#34;was seen on Dr. Oz.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Maybe because you need to buy more then one I don&#x27;t know. I didn&#x27;t feel or see any changes and I used every last one. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I honestly dont see any difference</li>
    <li> Not so sure this works yet, to early to tell but not upset with my purchase!&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t play you can&#x27;t win!</li>
    <li> At first, I was doubtful of the brand because it offers too-good-to-be-true improvements. I tried to check the truthfulness of the ingredients used and I found out that they were actually good for me. I tried it and it gave me more confidence. My friends actually commented that I did look younger. I took a picture and I could see it. More lines are fading.On my forehead, I used to have lines that make me look older, but after a few weeks of using the lines slowly disappears. I may be aging but it was hidden with the help of this product. Now I am enjoying myself together with my family having fun playing under the sun without worrying too much of my skin getting damaged. And it’s all because of this product.</li>
    <li> Love it. Easy to take. My hair is shinier and thicker after two months of taking one a day.</li>
    <li> Saw and felt improvement in about 1 1/2 weeks. Though bought this for my face, all my skin feels better moisturized, my husband felt the benefits within days. He works outside and has dry patches in certain areas of his face. Those areas have greatly improved with some being entirely gone. Have been taking this for 3 weeks now and like what I see, fine lines and wrinkles, some diminishing, more plump due to better hydration.</li>
    <li> To start with, you can&#x27;t beat the price. This stuff is AMAZING! As with any supplement, you need to religiously take it every day and you will not get results until the second bottle. Be patient, it is worth it! I am 45 and no one had guessed my age to be over 30.</li>
    <li> I am just on my second day and tonight when I cleaned my face I have noticed that my 11 lines on my forehead had  diminished a bit, actually more than a bit. So I put my glasses back on and sure I was right. I don&#x27;t know how this pill is working but so far I am not disappointed. I drink about 4 to 5 glasses of water. Now my question is, do I have to take the pill forever or is my face drying up like a raisin after stopping which I am not planning to do if it continues to work</li>
    <li> I have only been using it for 2 weeks and I don&#x27;t expect any results yet, hopefully by the time I finish the bottle I will see some improvement.  If i do I will buy another bottle</li>
    <li> I received a dirty white bottle with a computer generated label with no ingredients.  It just said as seen on Dr. Oz.  I would never take this without company information.. ingredients.  It is actually quite scarey.... do not buy this product!  You have no idea what you are taking or where it came from.  I am very surprised something ingested can be marketed this way.</li>
    <li> I used it for three months and I saw notorious improvement by my jaw line not sure if was all the effect due to the product cause at same time gain 7 pounds needed it, but don&#x27;t wanna risk it and I order another 4 bottles now cause all my face looks different for good</li>
    <li> Tested the pill one day as directed (only thing I am taking) and got a headache later that day. Did not take one for two days. No headache. Third day took another as directed and headache returned. I am sure this is a good product just not for me.&lt;br /&gt; Thank you</li>
    <li> satisfied with purchase will buy again</li>
    <li> Did not help with weight loss.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me....</li>
