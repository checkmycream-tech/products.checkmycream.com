      <li>I love this will buy it again</li>
      <li>I love the scent, love the size and the bubbliness</li>
      <li>This is my husbands favorite body wash</li>
      <li>Glad I tried it.</li>
      <li>Love hempz products.</li>
      <li>i love this body wash</li>
      <li>is very light its not as strong as the (Hempz Rosemary Mint Body Wash).</li>
      <li>enough time frame to tell you this is good stuff!)</li>
      <li>Smells great and leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>It has the best clean scent and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out!</li>
      <li>We put this body wash on our Dad who was 87 years old and his skin never looked so good.  </li>
      <li>This body wash smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
      <li>Leaves your skin clean, and does not leave a soapy residue.</li>
      <li>Large size makes this an economical purchase and the fragrance is so refreshing in the morning.</li>
      <li>It also seems quite mild.  </li>
      <li>(pretty sure that&#x27;s a word), however, it really isn&#x27;t that moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>I use one pump worth of body wash every morning on the shower</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way for a smooth, deliciously scented shower with tons of suds!</li>
      <li>the lather is great, a little goes along way, and it moisturizes the skin very well</li>
      <li>Smells amazing - doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
      <li>do love the wash itself, It smells great and a little bit goes a long ways.</li>
      <li>Clean fresh natural scent.</li>
      <li>Again a product that leaves a gentle scent, and still manages to wake me up in the mornings!  </li>
      <li>This large bottle with pump is very convenient and will last a good long time.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t have dry skin issues, I&#x27;m sure this will work really well for you...if you do, however, I&#x27;d pass.</li>
      <li>I really like this body wash the smell</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Will continue to use it for a long time as the bottle is huge.</li>
      <li>Not to mention, used as a shaving soap, the skin is left smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>His old nave tattoos became vibrant!  </li>
      <li>When a new bottle comes, I just move my pump to the new bottle!</li>
      <li>after tying both this and the mint sent, the mint is a little more masculine.</li>
      <li>My bf has sensitive skin and has gone through numerous body washes all to find that most keep his skin dry and itchy throughout the day.</li>
      <li>First of all the bottle wasn&#x27;t sealed properly so the product had leaked through the box upon delivery.</li>
      <li>Love the body wash, very gentle, my skin has improved from itchy to normal and no more dry skin.</li>
      <li>I ordered this product thinking its all natural since the ingredient list claims so.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and prone to itch break outs</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth a try for anyone curious or have any sort of skin issues.</li>
      <li>The hemp oil base leaves skin soft and moisturized - excellent product</li>
      <li>It is worth the money if you can afford it, and feels completely different than other body washes.</li>
      <li>Again, just barely a teaspoon applied to a wash cloth, or to what I use the bathing &amp;#34;Scruffy&amp;#34;, is just enough for this 5&#x27;10 gal.  </li>

    <li> Concentrated, not much needed to wash up. This large bottle with pump is very convenient and will last a good long time. Smells awesome and leaves skin feeling silky smooth. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good stuff! A bit pricey though.</li>
    <li> I really like this body wash the smell is very light its not as strong as the (Hempz Rosemary Mint Body Wash). the lather is great, a little goes along way, and it moisturizes the skin very well I will be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> This is my families favorite body wash here in Hawaii! It smells great, lathers well and rinses off clean! I ended up getting [[ASIN:B004MLXQ54 Keratin Complex 33oz(1Liter) Pump - 2-Pack]] to make it easier to use in the shower, works awesome! When a new bottle comes, I just move my pump to the new bottle!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product thinking its all natural since the ingredient list claims so. When I received the product,  I was disappointed to learn that it contains Sodium lauryl sulphate , unfortunately there was no mention of it anywhere and they claim it to be organic.</li>
    <li> First of all the bottle wasn&#x27;t sealed properly so the product had leaked through the box upon delivery. When I looked into exchanging it, it seems I needed to contact the company itself. I didn&#x27;t want to bother with the extra step so I chose to keep it as is.&lt;br /&gt;I do love the wash itself, It smells great and a little bit goes a long ways.</li>
    <li> I seem to keep repeating myself on all Hemp Based products.  Again a product that leaves a gentle scent, and still manages to wake me up in the mornings!  Again, just barely a teaspoon applied to a wash cloth, or to what I use the bathing &amp;#34;Scruffy&amp;#34;, is just enough for this 5&#x27;10 gal.  Not to mention, used as a shaving soap, the skin is left smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best body wash I&#x27;ve used. It is worth the money if you can afford it, and feels completely different than other body washes. It&#x27;s worth a try for anyone curious or have any sort of skin issues.</li>
    <li> Good product but it came open during shipping</li>
    <li> Love this product. Smells amazing - doesn&#x27;t dry my skin. Leaves your skin clean, and does not leave a soapy residue.</li>
    <li> The Body Wash is very nice and lathers well. The smell is not overwhelming but rather subtle - once you get out of the shower you just smell clean and refreshed. It does not leave a soapy film in the shower either. What a great deal!</li>
    <li> My bf has sensitive skin and has gone through numerous body washes all to find that most keep his skin dry and itchy throughout the day. Then I come along with a bottle of hempz body wash and hes never turned back. I&#x27;ve been buying the body wash for myself for many many years and now that my bf uses it, I&#x27;ve been buying for him for 6 years now (hopefully thats enough time frame to tell you this is good stuff!). We also use the hempz lotion, with great success and happiness as well. Clean fresh natural scent. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love hempz products. I&#x27;ve been using this exclusively for body wash for several years now. My boyfriend, who has bad dermatitis to many soaps has absolutely no issues with this product when he&#x27;s had to use it. One liter of this last me slightly over a year</li>
    <li> 4 only because it&#x27;s expensive</li>
    <li> A good cleaning soap that feels nice and clean after useing it.</li>

    <li> Love the body wash, very gentle, my skin has improved from itchy to normal and no more dry skin. Love the fragrance too.</li>
    <li> i love this body wash it smells so good feels good on your skin a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> I love the scent, love the size and the bubbliness (pretty sure that&#x27;s a word), however, it really isn&#x27;t that moisturizing.

    <li> Amazing! Lasts forever and smells wonderful! This is my third bottle. I use one pump worth of body wash every morning on the shower the bottle lasts me a minimum of three months. The initial investment can be expensive but this stuff lasts quite a long time!</li>
