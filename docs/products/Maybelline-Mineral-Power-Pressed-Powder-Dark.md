<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product came extremely quickly. I don&#x27;t wear the powder for makeup purposes, I use it to make my parts on my wigs look realistic.</li>
    <li> I bought this powder and it was old as all get out. This powder must of been from the 1980 because it had an old 50% off sign on it and it had faded off. Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t pay to buy online. I was very disappointed and don&#x27;t let me get started on the power. What a waste of my hard earned money. I thought this powder was from this century. Stop selling old products</li>
    <li> The Maybelline Mineral Power Finishing Veil Powder is light, yet gives excellent coverage. It&#x27;s perfect for when all you need is an even tone. It&#x27;s my daily go-to foundation.</li>
    <li> I love this dark pressed powder because it covers a lot of my marks I have on my face, which gives my face a flawless look. The product lasts me about 2-3 months because I use it about twice a week and I still come back online to purchase this product once I run out. I recommend this product for those who have dark complexion and want to have a more defined glow after applying makeup.</li>
    <li> One of the BEST Products on the market</li>
    <li> I have the product to death its great with my oily skin plus it came in great condition will definitely keep buying</li>
    <li> I consider this too light for &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; but it still works for me. This will be perfect for the winter months</li>
    <li> This is a nice purse accessory. Mineral powider is becoming harder to find at a good price. I like the powder with the mirror included.</li>
    <li> Glad to find it online as I cannot find it in town. Came as described and works as it should. Want a case of it!</li>
    <li> Like the finish...its good over foundation to give the look I wanted</li>
    <li> Loved it !!!! Will be ordering another !!! Shipping excellent ! No complaints !</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the reviews and yes in fact itnis great. I Bought the dark and it was way to dark for my color. I am around an ivory color and this is more like a expresso with milk type of chocolate. Great quality and it is great. i will be using it for an eyeshadow perhaps. Recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love the way it sets my foundation but I kind of wished I got it in medium because the dark is a little to dark but overall its good I will be buying again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m mad that I can&#x27;t find this at Walmart / Walgreens anymore. But I was happy to get it here and for less. Love this mineral powder. It evens out my makeup perfectly.</li>
    <li> I love the quality of this product</li>
    <li> easy to apply and very matte what I really love..... great product  nice smell stay on good if you apply it right</li>
    <li> Excellent powder, have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> This is THE PERFECT BRONZER. There are so many bronzers that I can&#x27;t wear because they have too much glitter or shimmer. This is very matte, but still manages to provide that &amp;#34;No, I didn&#x27;t just roll out of bed&amp;#34; look. It does provide coverage and is perfect for someone like myself who wants my pores to appear smaller and not larger due to shimmer. I love that you can apply just a bit with a large brush or more with a smaller, firm brush. For reference, I&#x27;m NC45 in MAC and this can be used as either a bronzer or as an all-over foundation. I hate to see that it&#x27;s no longer sold in stores.</li>
    <li> I was using Trublend by Covergirl. I cannot find this powder where I live so when I found it on Amazon for such a cheap price, I couldn&#x27;t help but to try it. I like it better. I use it on my lace wig and on my face. I&#x27;m surprised that the color is classified as &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; because I didn&#x27;t feel that it should be considered dark. Very good coverage and gives your face a smooth, flawless finish. I have acne scarring and you can barely tell. It is as smooth as liquid foundation. The compact is great as well as it comes with an applicator sponge and a mirror. If you have a darker skin tone though, I&#x27;m not sure it would match. I will definitely order again. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping great product</li>
    <li> Amazing blends in great and matches my skin tone.</li>
    <li> I buy this powder for my mom and she loves it.  Makes her skin look really pretty.  Cannot believe they can sell it this cheap!</li>
