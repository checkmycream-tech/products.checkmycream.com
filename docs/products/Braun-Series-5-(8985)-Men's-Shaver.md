<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use it for the recommended period for your face to get accustomed to the electric shave. My skin always wound up irritated so I returned it.</li>
    <li> I bought this more than a year ago and my wife has complained endlessly that it does not shave any better than my older worn-out Remington (got about 7 years use out of that one).  The cleaning system did not seem to make the shaver work significantly better and after the second refill, I quit using it (additional cleaning cartridges, that is).  The cleaning solution would irritate my face, so I would have to clean the shaver after the cleaning solution had been used.  The travel kit is good and the accessories are nice, but if I could give this a 3.5 stars I would, but my wife used to rant and rave about how smooth my face was with the prior shaver.  I&#x27;m going to give Panasonic a chance next since Remington shavers seem to average 3 starts here on Amazon.  I do not think I will be selecting Braun again anytime soon as a result of this.  The beard trimmer is very strong and borders on abrasive, so I bought a dedicated Panasonic beard trimmer which was far more effective by being gentle, yet sharp (no \\&quot;pulling\\&quot; sensation with it).</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver 2 years ago and it&#x27;s not very good.  I don&#x27;t have that much experience with electric shavers, but this one does not produce a close shave.  It also leaves my skin red and irritated.  The charging station itself doesn&#x27;t really work either.  I have to keep cleaning the connectors and jostling around the shave to get it to charge in the station.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shaver from Amazon before its mid-July release and have been using it for a little more than 2 weeks. Today&#x27;s multiple blade safety razors lift the hair slightly above the opening of the follicle where it is cut then recedes back into place. Because it was lifted upward first before being cut, it actually returns to a position below the skin surface. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The skin provides protection from certain types of harmful bacteria and it is not perfectly smooth. Hair harbors bacteria and so can your razor. Even trace amounts of the ingredients found in shaving foams/gels plus any leftover stubble is a breeding ground for it. Also, most people leave their razors in the bathroom. Need I say more? Shaving with a blade razor abrades the skin. This abrasion, along with hair receding below the follicle opening, provides access for bacteria to exploit; ergo the hygienic justification for the clean and renew system associated with the Braun shaver.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The shaver and its charging/cleaning base are an attractive appliance with a small footprint. The power cord can either be attached to the charging/cleaning base or directly to the shaver itself. The clean and renew cartridge installs easily into the base. Then plug it in, insert the shaver and allow for initial charging. The unit will not begin the cleaning cycle until the blue button on the front of the base is depressed, so it can be charged from the base without cleaning. The cleaning base has sensors that determine what level of cleaning is necessary. No selection is required. The only time that you need to remove the micro-screen shaving head to clean mechanically with the supplied brush is when you are on a trip and away from the cleaning base. One note about the clean and renew cartridges, the CCR2 and the CCR3 are the same. The number indicates how many replacement cartridges are included in the package. The shaver is ergonomically designed to fit well in the hand, is well balanced, and the controls are very simple. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I really appreciate the improved level of hygiene because of the clean and renew system. Not that I had a complexion problem before using the Braun (I didn&#x27;t) but my skin looks clearer and has better tone than it has in a long time, maybe ever. I am thoroughly pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> This may not be a fair review since I purchased the Braun 8585 almost a year ago and I have yet to be impressed with the quality of the shave from that shaver and here I am posting this review under the 8985 but it also annoys me that there is no 8585 anymore (one year later) to review. That&#x27;s a little short a liftime don&#x27;t you think? Prior to owning the 8585 I used a Norelco rotary shaver.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As for the 8585, it seems to have trouble with second day growth and, if you don&#x27;t shave on a regular basis like me, it seems to take twice as long to get a good shave. I have tried everything from shaving before or after a shower, shaving with the head free to move or locking it in place, and cleaning it every time I use it (which helps but seems to add unecessary cost to shaving). No matter what I have tried the quality of the shave leaves me with a shadow at 4 o&#x27;clock, something that I didn&#x27;t have to worry about before the 8585.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I also find the pop-up cutter to be very &#x60;scratchy&#x27; on my neck and difficult to use on my mustache since the cutter is hidden from view when you use it. And if I start the cleaner when I leave for work, the racket it makes wakes up my wife. All issues that the 8985 probably has. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Braun because I had heard that a foil shaver gives a closer, quicker shave; not true for me. I have put a rotary shaver back on my wish list, it worked better.</li>
    <li> This item was a Christmas present for my son-in-law.  He was excited to get it and he has told me that is works excellent!!</li>
    <li> Been using for over a month now.  Much closer shave than my old Norelco.  Cleaning system takes some getting used to but appears to be of value.  Battery life is excellent; used on vacation for 10 days and was still going strong.  Docking station is a little bulky and has an irritating blue light.</li>
    <li> best electric razor ever had in 50 years. no razor burn,close shave. easy claen</li>
    <li> This is my third electric razor. The previous two were made by Norelco (one was a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; razor; the other a \\&quot;wet\\&quot;/in-the-shower) razor. I&#x27;m a lot happier with this Braun razor for several reasons: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1) The Braun gives me a closer shave with fewer strokes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2) The Braun gives me a more comfortable shave. All electric razors are hard on the neck area, but the Braun is the best of the bunch. My neck never adjusted to the Norelcos even after months of shaving. After using the Braun for about a week and getting the hang of how to angle the shaver, it gives a much more comfortable shave than either of the Norelcos. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;3) If I go a few days without shaving, it&#x27;s no big deal. I can use the built-in trimmer to make my beard manageable to shave with the regular shaver. This is unlike the Norelco, where if I didn&#x27;t shave for a few days, I&#x27;d have to shave my face first with a hand razor before I could go back to the electric. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;4) It&#x27;s always clean. I figured the \\&quot;Clean and Renew\\&quot; feature was somewhat of a sales gimmick, but it&#x27;s not. Not at all. It&#x27;s always clean when I take it out of the base, and that&#x27;s a big step up from the dry Norelco, which would build up grease over time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Additional note: The Clean&amp;Renew cartridges are filled with regular SD alcohol (the kind you buy at your local CVS/RiteAid). If you want to save money you can clean them out and simply refill them with SD alcohol.</li>
    <li> Outstanding! I was advised by a dermotologist to began using an electric shaver that could be cleaned properly.  Within a week my face had adapted to the Braun, which resulted in a shave as close as a blade. Once done it&#x27;s a snap to clean...insert in the charger/cleaner and you&#x27;re done until the next shave. Cordless with a durable travel case. I&#x27;ll never use a blade again.</li>
    <li> The self cleaning is great, it cuts smooth, and its motor is fairly quiet. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as a \\&quot;first\\&quot; electric razor because you won&#x27;t realize just how awsome this thing is without comparing it to something else. So go ahead, buy a much cheaper razor first. After you smash it against the wall because it sucks, buy this one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a LOT of electric shavers in my day, and this is the best one yet. My only gripe would be that the blue charge light is amazingly bright, I used Google Earth to see my house and could see the little light shining in the window (just kidding). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Peace.</li>
    <li> This is the one to have.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> I had several Norelco razors before but I had to use a straight razor to do the skin below my chin because of irritation.  This razor did not irritate my skin at all.  It shaves close, self-cleans, and tells me when it needs to be charged.  I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used Braun shavers for over 30 years, and this new one is the best yet.  I enjoy the smooth shave, and the freshness of the razor every morning.</li>
    <li> The Braun shaver is excellent. Gives a good shave.  This my second Braun and is a big improvement over the original one.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews but I really wanted to take a moment to post about this shaver. I&#x27;ve used several electric razors over the years, including Remington, Norelco, and now two Brauns (and probably a couple of others).  I can&#x27;t shave with a blade because I have sensitive skin but an extremely thick, wiry beard.  Blades, even the ones with 4 blades and the lubricating strip etc., just tear my skin up and I end up with several days of irritation, discomfort and red bumps.    My last Braun, which I purchased quite a few years ago (and it was expensive at the time), was the best razor I&#x27;d used to date, but was still noisy and SLOW.  It would take me 45 minutes to get a decent shave even with a brand new head and foil, even with the razor plugged in.  Plus it didn&#x27;t hold the razor stubble in the head very well so I ended up with a mess of razor dust all over my shirt.    I got this Braun 360 Complete 8985 last Christmas and for the first time, shaving wasn&#x27;t a chore but was actually very quick, easy and painless!  What a relief.  Instead of feeling like I was dragging sandpaper over my face for 45 minutes, it felt like wiping butter off, and I could get the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten with an electric razor in under 10 minutes.  Actually I was able to get an acceptable quick shave in like 6 minutes, but if I took my time it was even better.    Other reviewers have already spoken about the excellent cleaning and charging system, which really is excellent though in fact you do need to keep it in one spot without moving it or it will spill.  When I travel I simply take the cord with me for charging and clean it with the brush.    I&#x27;ll also point out that after I shave, I pop the foil open and run the razor over a trash can for a few seconds to shake out the hair, then I clean it quickly with the brush before using the charging/cleaning base.  Doing this (and generally only using the base after every other shave), one cartridge actually lasts me about 3 months!!Can&#x27;t complain about that.    I love the clever and useful features like the fact that the base will detect when the battery needs to be conditioned and will actually discharge and fully charge it to condition the battery.  And I like the fact that the base somehow senses how much of a cleaning it needs.  The razor also just informed me this weekend that I need a new foil and cutter head.  What a great feature!  When it did that I gave it some thought and realized it has been taking me somewhat longer to shave recently, so yeah, it&#x27;s definitely time.    Nothing&#x27;s perfect but this razor is absolutely worth the price and it&#x27;s a fantastic product that has made shaving merely a simple inconvenience for me rather than the painful, time-consuming chore it used to be.  (Oh, and it does mostly hold the stubble in the head, so no mess on my shirt or bathroom sink.)  Thumbs up, five stars.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver due to advertising report that it was the \\&quot;Best\\&quot;  I have a pretty heavy beard and after 1 month of using it, I feel that it is not any better than my 6 year old rotery head shaver....just costs much more!</li>
    <li> The 8985 is hands-down the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. The shaver quickly plows through dense facial hair and provides a shave that is as close to a blade as I&#x27;ve had. Although the cleaning solution costs a few bucks a month, the cleaning base is incredibly convenient when you are in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time to manually clean your razor.     My only problem with the razor is that it has some trouble shaving my toughest neck hair. I did, admittedly, have ridiculously high expectations for this razor. Either way, with a little bit of pushing and time, I can usually remove most of the hair on my neck.</li>
    <li> The quest for a new shaver was not an easy one for me. I&#x27;ve been a Braun customer for years, but my previous Braun shaver wasn&#x27;t treating my face that well. My beard/stubble/growth is of the really tough, scouring pad variety. In contrast, I&#x27;ve got semi-oily, dry and sensitive skin on my cheeks and neck (I know it sounds hot, but ladies, I&#x27;m taken). My previous Braun shaver was leaving me feeling like I had just mowed my face with lawn tractor outfitted with a front-facing flamethrower. And while my checks were smooth, my neck hairs weren&#x27;t cut and my skin looked like I got in a fight with a blender. Upgrading to the 8985 solved all of that. My skin feels great after I shave, primarily because it&#x27;s not burning or bleeding. It gets my stubborn neck hairs. It cleans itself -- joy! It feels light in my hand and easy to maneuver. The trim feature actually works quite well. I considered one of those shavers with the orbiting shave heads, but decided to stick with what I know and am glad I did.</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun (first was the Activator, which was great) and my second Pulsonic. I returned the first Pulsonic when the charge time only lasted 15 minutes (2 shaves).  The replacement Pulsonic is doing the same thing.  I have charged it three times in less than a week.  I called Braun and the receptionist would not transfer my call to anyone, saying it was a service problem.  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> The Braun 8985 360 men&#x60;s shaver is an excellent product and I would    highly recommend the unit if you want a close shave with a electric razor.The only drawback is the cleaning system,you have no good way to travel with it.</li>
    <li> this is a fantastic shaving system from braun.&lt;br /&gt;i received this last year for father;s day, and was excited to start using it, but not looking forward to that \\&quot;adjustment period\\&quot; the skin goes thru when switching from a traditional razor to an electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i cant say it will be true for everyone, but my skin went thru NO adjustment period. never did i get red or irritated or itchy. it is also, by FAR, the closest shave ive ever gotten with an electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in the interest of conserving the liquid in the cleaning area, i only press the cleaning button about once every 3-4 shaves...if even that.&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t have a very course beard, but i have never found there to be any pulling or pinching due to lack of cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great product from braun.</li>
    <li> If you have sensituve skin and you are thinking about getting an electric shaver, this one could be the best option.</li>
    <li> Three reasons it only gets 3 stars.  1: My foil wore out in 9 months, not the 18 months as promised.  2: My neck still seems a little rough.  3: The cost of the replacement cleaning units.      It shaves as good as any other electric razor I&#x27;ve had, but I have some disappointments.  I have a somewhat-rough beard, but for the money I would have hoped for a longer life from the foil.</li>
    <li> I have used manual razors all my life and thought I would give a good quality electric razor a shot.  I haven&#x27;t given an electric razor a try in about 8 years and figured they have improved by now.  This electric razor reminds me of the experience I had a long time ago but worse.  It&#x27;s terrible at cutting hair and irritates my skin far worse then a manual razor.  The instructions say to give your face 2 to 3 weeks to \\&quot;get used to the razor\\&quot;...  omg.  I am not gonna go to work with razor burn and stubble on my face for 3 weeks.  Braun, your razor should adapt to my skin, not my skin adapt to your razor.</li>
    <li> This shaver looks great and cleans itself well, but it doesn&#x27;t give a super close shave. I&#x27;m aware that electric shavers normally don&#x27;t give a very close shave, but all the reviews and ads made this one out to be the messiah of all shavers so I expected more.</li>
    <li> I am not sure what the fuss is all about. Perhaps the 7 series have some extraordinary performance but I didn&#x27;t sense any specific outcome from the 5 series. It&#x27;s a good shaver but not $100 better than my previous norelco.    Mohammad Yamin North Andover</li>
    <li> I just got the Pansonic Vortex es-la63-s and it is much better than this piece of crap. This thing is horrible, I shaved with it and it irritates my skin and doesn&#x27;t give a close shave. I had bad skin for days and weeks and almost gave up the electric razor race.</li>
    <li> good razor, came in new , on eof the better razors that i have ever owned( shaving for 30 years)</li>
    <li> bought this razor on recommendation of a shaver products store owner who was closing shop. It seems overpriced relative to other products I&#x27;ve used in the past and others that are on the market. I wanted a product with a long lifetime (previous shavers I&#x27;ve used with moderate frequency have lasted 2-3 years), and also with a clipper that could clip full beard including neck. The clipper head is too small to do this effectively. Perhaps the shaver will last a long time, but unless you&#x27;re really into shaving, I&#x27;d buy a cheaper product.</li>
    <li> I was looking at Today&#x27;s deal as I always do and I saw this item in gold Box and I was like, this is a good price for Braun.  Usually Braun is very expensive.  I never owned an electronic shaver before so I can&#x27;t say Braun is better than the other ones.  But I would have to say I was very impressed.  It shaves close and it is painless.  Very impressed with this and I am glad I got it for real cheap.  I can&#x27;t believe how much money I saved with this item in gold box.  Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> First of all, it shaves very well -- not QUITE blade close, but it doesn&#x27;t me bleed or irritate my skin, either.  I like the cleaner.  The trimmer can handle the longer hairs that can get away from an electric; no problems around my chin and nose (where some electrics don&#x27;t get it done).  High grades!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied, excellent shave.  Previously used Braun synchromesh, this shaver far superior.  Probably a top value as less expensive than updated series 5 and I don&#x27;t believe the newer model could shave any better than this unit.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend is Asian, and so has a course hard to trim facial hair.  So I bought this for him for Christmas.  He has been using it for several years now and it still works fantastic.  Smooth shave every time and only takes about a minute.</li>
    <li> As far as the shaver goes, it provides an adequate cut--no better and no worse than comparable electric razors.    The problems lie with the cleaning mechanisms.  After you shave, you place it in the cleaning unit, and it tells you whether you need an \\&quot;intensive\\&quot;, \\&quot;normal,\\&quot; or \\&quot;brief\\&quot; cleaning (it might use different adjectives).  In the two years I&#x27;ve had the razor, it has NEVER told me I needed a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; cleaning--always intensive or brief. This is true even if it&#x27;s been 6, 12, 24, 48 hours, or whatever since my last shave.    Even worse, after about a year, the cleaner started to really malfunction.  When I press the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; button it will start to clean, but then never turn off.  The normal cycle is supposed to be like 30-60 minutes (which I think is a bit long to begin with), but this thing will keep going for hours or days unless I shut it off!  Really a pain.  I took it to a repair guy (while it was still under warranty), and he didn&#x27;t do anything for me.    FInally, the alcohol refill cartridges are expensive--about $10-12 for a two-pack.  It&#x27;s freaking alcohol; what does that cost Braun to make, 29 cents a package?    Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for over 30 years and finally decided to spend the big bucks for the Braun after reading many favorable reviews here. After daily use for 2 months I have to say it&#x27;s a bit dissapointing. I&#x27;ve used Norelco and/or Remington shavers for years and thought the Braun would be much better but alas, I&#x27;ve found this not to be true. I&#x27;m returning the Braun and going back to another Remington and spend half as much. As with all electrics, you can&#x27;t expect to get the close shave of a blade but the Braun didn&#x27;t out perform shavers at half the price.</li>
    <li> First impression after putting together the base and the shaver is that it looks very hi-tech, especially with the blue LEDs. However, the base recharge/cleaning station is a bit big and feels awkward in my small bath room. The shaver itself feels good, the outer body shell is not metalatic but the unit as a whole feels pretty solid.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The first shave I did was right in the morning before &#x27;wash&#x27; up as recommended by Braun&#x27;s menu. This contradicts with my conventional approach of showering first. The result is very impressive, especially close on the normal surfaces (comparable to manual Mach3). The edges are not as close. Braun indicates that it will take you at least 10-12 days for your beard to get used to the electronic shaver (when moving from a manual shaver). I read that the logic behind this is that manual shaving takes the outer skin layer off which results in scar tissues growing back along with the beard. Electronic shaver does not remove that layer thus it will take a while for your scar tissue to go away and enable your electronic shaver to work more effectively. That is also the reason why you should NOT interchange between electronic and manual shaving. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Still in the evaluation period so lets see whether I get any surprises after 2 weeks. At the moment it feels more close than rotary shaver I tried before (Philips).  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The noise of the unit is not quiet but not loud either, reasonable for a shaver. But the cleaning can be quite loud, so always better to clean in the morning while you are off to work. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you can catch this shaver on sale, go for it, you won&#x27;t reject having the latest shaving technology at your disposal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  I gave it to my brother for Christmas and he loves it.  He normally uses a regular razor, but says he will never go back.  He loves all of its features and would recommend it to all men with different types of beards.  The price was great too!</li>
    <li> GREAT SHAVER,GREAT SYSTEM AUTO CLEAN.MY NEPHEWS USE IT NOW WHEN THEY VISIT,THEY&#x27;RE ALL BUYING THEIR OWN.</li>
    <li> With sensitive skin, I couldn&#x27;t shave everyday with a dual-blade disposable razor.  I wanted a razor I could use daily in the shower, but my wife surprised me with this one - and overall I&#x27;m happy.  The manual recommends shaving without lotion or water as they swell the skin, and although I was initially put off by this, it actually works and results in minimal irritation.  I just wash and moisturize afterwards.  The self-cleaning base is great, as it indicates how much cleaning is necessary (four levels of whisker clogging dirtiness), and another indicator lets you know when to change the alcohol-based cleaning cartridge.  The only thing I wish is that it gave a closer shave.  For areas where hair grows in one direction, the shave is closer, but for those complicated non-conformist folicles, too many go-overs with the razor can irritate the skin.  Again, overall I&#x27;m happy - and you can&#x27;t go wrong with having to replace the foil/blade every 18 months.  Better than some others out there.</li>
    <li> This is a truly great product. Great shaving ability, cleaning is a breeze, no complaints.</li>
    <li> The self cleaning is the greatest feature! Just put your razor in the base and press clean, no more pulling the foil off and brushing the blades. I have been using this razor for over a month (change the cleaning refil after a month) now and it is still as fresh as the first day I used it. Nice clean shave and NO irratation at all! I actually look forward to shaving with this razor. The only thing that could use improving on is the trimmer, it is a little small but with a little practice, you&#x27;ll get the hang of it. Overall I am very happy with it and would not hesitate to recomend it to anyone. I would buy this razor again without a second thought.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a wet razor user for years.  I got the Braun razor for Christmas last year and use it every day.  It&#x27;s great.  I used to get nasty irritation and ingrown hairs around my neckline with the regular wet razor, but not at all with the electric.  I was worried that the electric wouldn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade.  Especially since CR said it wouldn&#x27;t.  But, I think it shaves just as well.  And the stubble isn&#x27;t as sharp either.  The Clean and Renew system is great too.  It really does feel like a new shaver after the cleaning.  Mine typically went to the \\&quot;Eco\\&quot; level of cleaning and the cartidge has lasted over six weeks.  I&#x27;ll probably be able to get nearly two months of cleanings before I&#x27;ll have to replace it.  Although, I may stretch it out a bit because of the cost of the cartridges and I can cheap on some things.  Overall, a great electric shaver and very comfortable.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an old Norelco shaver I had. I am very impressed with the SPEED at which I can shave, and the closeness I can get with that shave. I know that some people feel that electric razors may not be as close as regular razors, and I cannot attest to that, but if you are in the electric razor world, this provides a really really nice shave. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A few things: &lt;br /&gt;1. The cleaning is loud, so I hope you are not in the same room. It gets kind of annoying. &lt;br /&gt;2. The cleaning does not clean the beard trimmer, just the razor part &lt;br /&gt;3. Comes with a nice locking feature to hold the head in place so it doesn&#x27;t swivel. That provides a better shave. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> So much better than my top&#x3D;of&#x3D;the&#x3D;line Norelco that I am very pleased. &lt;br /&gt;It was comfortable the very first time.</li>
    <li> I purchased a new Braun 360 shaver recently and I am very satisfied with its perfofmance so far.It does amuch better job on my neck area and shaves very close with no irritation.The cleaning action is also very good.</li>
    <li> I have had a series of Braun Shavers, and this one is the best by far.  Although more expensive, it does do a great job of cleaning itself, and it shaves much closer than my previous unit, while at the same time being smoother and less irritating to the skin.  Having read reviews prior to buying, I expected the shaver to be noisy, but it is less so than my previous ones.  All in all, I am quite satisfied.</li>
    <li> Unlike many of the other reviewers, I actually bought this shaver to use on my head. I have been shaving my head for the past 2 years and during that time have used a Panasonic ES8066. It was a fine product (able to be used either wet or dry, unlike the Braun), but I had no idea that upgrading to the Braun 8985 would make such a difference. I shaved my head in one third the time it took me using the Panasonic! No longer did I need to keep going over the same spot again and again. The Braun took off the hair in one or two passes, cutting just as close with considerable ease and less irritation. I can&#x27;t believe I wasted two years shaving with my old shaver! I know Panasonic has since come out with new and improved shavers, and I can&#x27;t comment on its new Vortex shaver, but I know I won&#x27;t be returning my new Braun any time soon!</li>
    <li> I am sending mine back.  I have used Norelco shavers for some time, and have tried this one for 3 weeks now.  I thought it would be a better shave given the hoopla and supposed technical advantages.  It isn&#x27;t.  It still leaves uncut whiskers, and often gives me with a bloody nick - something I had never experienced from my fifty clam Norelco.      The cleaning station is cool, but the noise and blinking lights freak out some members of the family.  My razor doesn&#x27;t want to come out of the cleaning station without some fuss; it sometimes starts the cycle again when I try to release it - meaning the razor is saturated in alcohol just before I want to shave.</li>
    <li> semi-decent shave above the chin, but along the jawline, chin and neck expect CUTS from having to shove the shaver into your skin but still no shaving of stray hairs or even whole patches of hair! too bad</li>
    <li> My husband actually order this product for his Father&#x27;s Day gift. He asked me to submit this review as he is very pleased with the delivery speed and the product itself!  For my husband to be this pleased is priceless...thanks!</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this shaver. A lot smoother than my previous 7 series. I have not used the cleaner yet!</li>
    <li> This Braun Shaver provides a close shave (except on lower neck), is constructed well with a good charging time, and is worth the money. Unfortunately the cleaning base is not.  The cleaning base&#x27;s metal contacts creep back into base and do not provide a secure charge!  Even after taking base apart (which is risky, since the clean and renew base is constructed very flimsily and its&#x27; shoddy plastic components can easily break) the metal contacts will recede into base and you will not be able to charge or clean shaver without buying a new clean and renew base, which costs about sixty dollars.  The shaver is excellent build quality, made in Germany, but the cleaning base was outsourced in Hungary and is very poor quality.  I think Braun needs to really put more effort into constructing a quality clean and renew base for it&#x27;s fine shaver.  Otherwise, this shaver is definitely not worth its&#x27; expensive price tag.</li>
    <li> (A note before I start: A lot of people who panned this in other reviews seem to think that an electric should shave as close as a manual bladed razor.  I guess this might be a self-inflicted view created by the electric razor companies&#x27; own marketing teams, but it will never be true.  A manual blade shave will always be a better cut than an electric razor.)    In terms of an electric razor - compared to other electrics - I have had a great experience with this one.  I&#x27;ve had Braun and Philips/Norelco electrics in the past and this is the best of them.    It gives a good cut, the &#x27;hedge trimmer&#x27; in the middle does a decent job on longer hairs on the occasions when I leave it several days between shaves, and despite what some have reported it doesn&#x27;t seem any louder than any electric bar shaver I&#x27;ve had in the past.  (yes its louder than an electric rotary shaver, but those are always quieter due to the type of mechanism).     I like the charging base, but to me its a nice-to-have and not really a feature of the razor itself (which is really the important thing after all).      The cleaning solution gizmo is also a good idea, but as many other reviewers here have already mentioned it doesn&#x27;t need to be used as often as the Braun likes to tell you it does.  I use mine once a week max, and in between I just slide the cartridge out and reseal it with the plastic cover it comes with to prevent evaporation.  The automatic cleaning process is quite loud, but does that really matter?  If you only do it once a week or so, just plan on doing it when people aren&#x27;t trying to sleep.  It&#x27;s like complaining that a coffee maker is loud when brewing a cappuccino, so what?  Don&#x27;t do it if baby is trying to sleep next to it.    I do occasionally find that it does miss some longer hairs in the area at the corner of the jawbone right near the ears, but I can remedy that by going over that area a couple of times again at the end of the shave.  It doesn&#x27;t always do this, so I suspect it has something to do with the angle of the razor when I make the first pass over that area which makes the difference.    Overall, a very good razor at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I cant shave my neck area without breaking out, this has fixed all that. Best purchase ever, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for about 2 weeks now.  I bought it as a replacement for a Panasonic Wet-Dry that I have had for about 5 years.  It was getting a minimum recharge battery life by this point and needed a new foil/blade.  Amazon had a $149 - $50 store credit on the next purchase which I think ended 7/31, so for a net of $100, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From my limited time using it, I have found that it does actually work best when your face is a little oily- washing the oils off doesn&#x27;t allow it to slide very well and you can hear the mechanism&#x27;s rpm&#x27;s drop a bit, presumably from more pressure that is applied.  It cuts very well, although a ridge under my neck which only cuts well with a blade didn&#x27;t doso well with this electric either.  The cleaning system as others have stated, does well to get any stray whiskers out.  Decide for yourself whether it is worth the cost of new cartridges vs manually cleaning with the brush.  There&#x27;s nothing that says you have to use the cleaner, although Braun recommends it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall not a bad razor, a bit thicker handle than my old one.  I hope I get 5 years out of this one the same as I did the Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 other Braun Shavers, most recently the the Braun 5100 series.  When the battery from my last shaver started to lose its charge, I had to try the new Braun. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At first, I thought the new bells and whistles, and buzz words were all a marketing ploy, and that the shave wouldn&#x27;t be that much better.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was wrong.  The new blade and the shaving motion got to the tricky spots on my face, especially the hairs that grew against the grain.  It&#x27;s by far the best shaver I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver based on the online reviews I read. Recently, Consumer Reports also rated this shaver one of the top. The shaver is fast and quiet. However, it does not shave as close as my old panasonic shaver without burning the skin. Also, cleaning solution is an ongoing expense and also a hassle if you are travelling for long periods. Although no regrets, I may consider going back to panasonic next time.</li>
    <li> This product shaves well. Like the manual says your skin needs to adjust to the razor over the first few days of use (up to 20).  &lt;br /&gt;I love the trim feauture which lets you shave the tough spots like your mustache or line up your goatee (it especially helps in those areas of your face that will become irritated regardless of how much you try not to shave too long over, i.e. the area above your chin).  &lt;br /&gt;The only drawback for this shaver is the fact that it does not shave as close as a conventional blade (i.e. mach 3 and such) and that the shaver will heat up after shaving for more than 5 minutes which will cause irritation.  &lt;br /&gt;Other than that the product is great, you will no longer get the shaving bumps you get from regular razors and the clean &amp; renew system gives you a brand new shaver everytime you clean it.  &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad i bought this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this gift as a present and he loved it!</li>
    <li> Excellent shave. However, I continue to experience a problem with the shaver each time I try to release it from it&#x27;s pod after it has gone through it&#x27;s cleaning cycle. It just will not release the shaver unless I pull the electrical contact from the socket. I hate to go thru the trouble, but it looks like I &#x27;ll have to send the damn thing back.</li>
    <li> I found the Braun 8985 360 shaver to be a prime example of over development of what should be a relatively simple piece of equipment for  a relatively simple task--shaving one&#x27;s face and neck.  The cleaning and charging stand with its tank of cleaning fluid is just not necessary.  It calls too much attention to itself and unnecessarily complicates a simple task.  I have found the Remington shaver with which I replaced the Braun to be a great shaver that can be used wet or dry, cleaned under running water. and charged with a simple connecting wire.</li>
    <li> The Braun 360 Complete is the best shaver I&#x27;ve owned, and I have had many. I&#x27;m 58 years old and I used all sorts of shavers in my lifetime and this is the all time best. Without going into detailed shaving experiences, I use this to shave my face and my head. It&#x27;s quick, close, and easy. I read some of the negatives in other reviews, and I don&#x27;t see any merit to them. Maybe some people have to nit-pick every little detail. If you want a terrific razor, get this one. PERIOD. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A comment about Amazon: I ordered this on February 26th, received it March 3rd, and this was with free shipping. I figured I wouldn&#x27;t get it for at least 10 days, but here it is in 5 days. Not only is this razor terrific, but so is Amazon. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I had the 7000 series prior to this purchase.  This shaver gets the job done quicker, but I wouldnt say its a closer shave.  I love the cleaning stand.  Its a bit loud, but its a great feature.</li>
    <li> I have now used the \\&quot;HIghly rated\\&quot; Braun 360 for 5 weeks and it now takes me much longer to shave for far worse results than all my other razors. This may be the worst one I have ever used and it was 3 times more expensive. Big lesson. Higher cost does not equel higher value!! Save yourselves a lot of waste and stay with a $50 razor.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my husband.  He used it for about 3 weeks, but still had red marks, and had to follow up afterwards with a regular \\&quot;disposable\\&quot; razor.  The whole process of shaving took twice as long as disposable razors and wasn&#x27;t as good. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Luckily, Braun had a 30 day money-back guarantee, so we were able to return it (minus shipping x 2).</li>
    <li> For years I used a rotary razer which I liked but could never get as close a shave as I wanted.  I also used a Mach razer from time to time. I also hesitated to buy the Braun because of the cost of the razer and cleaning refils but I am completely satisfied.  The shave is as close as I think I can get to blade as possible.  The difference for me between a blade razer and the Braun is almost unnoticable.  The feel on my skin was good as well.  Going from a rotary to this type of razer I was worried that my skin would burn and I would have troble getting used to it.  That was not the case.  The feel was smooth on the first use.  NO irritation or burning at all.  I have been using the Braun for about 60 days now and would definately buy it again.</li>
    <li> I once asked my husband why he took so darn long cleaning his razor. He explained to me that every time you shave, you make minor cuts to your skin even though you may not be aware of it. This is why cleaning the razor properly everyday is so important - reduces bacteria buildup. So, when I first saw the Braun Syncro, I bought it for him (mainly also for me so we could get ready faster in the mornings). He loved that thing! Well that is until the arm on the cleaning system broke after 5 years of daily use. So, I had to buy a new one... but which one? I opted for this one because it was on sale and the cleaning system didn&#x27;t require an arm to operate. He loved this one even more! He said he&#x27;s never had such a smoother shave in his life. In addition, the cleaning solution (he uses the cleaner every day) lasts much longer. He&#x27;s had it for a month now &amp; the system still says the cleaning solution is \\&quot;full\\&quot;. So all in all, though it may be a bit pricey &amp; the cost of the solution can add up, it&#x27;s a wonderful buy if you want to save time &amp; keep things properly clean. If you&#x27;re in the market for a new razor &amp; you like this design (vs. the round razor types), I think you should splurge for the Braun 360. I personally can&#x27;t attest to it, but my husband loves it!</li>
    <li> I have never used an electric razor before so I have nothing to compare.  I have a very tough beard that grows fast. I often shave two times a day and this product does take it easier on my face then a regular razor blade.  That is the reason I bought it.  However, it takes me longer to shave in the morning since I have to go multiple times over my face to get a clean shave.  I do not believe it is the product that is the cause, but rather my tough whiskers.  It also does not get my neck area very well. If you do not have so rough of a face, this product will work really great.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun shavers for many years.  The Braun 8985 system is the best I have used.  I get three comfortably close shaves on one battery charge.  The cleaning system seems to put my shaver in new condition each time I use it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a change from a wet shave and nicks. This shaver works fine and is easy to use. Not too keen on the required cleaner solution so I will make up my own when I figure out just what is in their formula. Nice, clean shave.</li>
    <li> This razor shaves well and cleans well.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it and I like it much better than the triple headed razor I used previously.</li>
    <li> I gave the Braun as a Christmas gift to my boyfriend and he loves it.  He&#x27;s had the same Braun for 15 years and it finally started to run down a bit.  He loves the new one and raves about how good his face feels.  I guess I&#x27;ll get him another one in 15 more years (chuckles)!  This is a shaver you may have to write into your last will and testament.</li>
    <li> The Braun 8985 360 Complete Men&#x27;s Shaver is very well designed offering an excellent shave and battery life. Contrary to the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendation, it is not necessary to use the automatic cleaning system on a daily basis. Instead, I do so every 4-5 shaves; while, in between, I do a manual cleaning (brushing the head, etc.) after each use.     If, however, my only option was to pay full retail price for the shaver - I would not have made the purchase. Amazon&#x27;s price and prompt delivery made the purchase and excellent buy.</li>
    <li> This shaver represents a slight improvement overall from the previous generation of Braun shaver. It&#x27;s a bit more comfortable and quieter.  However, my experience is that it doesn&#x27;t shave quite as closely--I find my beard comes back quicker as the day proceeds than its predecessor.    Tip: save on the cleaning liquid ripoff by cleaning head with brush and your breath before putting shaver into cleaning unit so the liquid lasts longer before getting too filthy to be effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a series of Braun shavers.  I bought an 8985 about 9 months ago and, although the shave quality is good, I find it unsatisfactory because it&#x27;s too fragile and expensive to run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 2.5 months after I bought it, the foil failed (hole), although I never touch the head with anything but my face or tissue, and always put the cap on the head.  I called customer service and was informed that Braun does not sell the foil separately anymore; you have to buy both cutter and foil.  To their credit, customer service did offer to send me a 8000FC replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, less than 6 months after replacing the foil and cutter, the foil has failed again (hole).  It&#x27;s obvious that the 8000-series foil is much more fragile than the foil on the 6000 and 7000 series shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not want to use a product that requires purchase of a new cutter &amp; foil every 3-6 months, at $30-$40 per pop.  In spite of the smooth shave it delivers, I&#x27;m going to consider other shavers that don&#x27;t nickel-and-dime the customer.</li>
    <li> Okay, let me start out by saying I&#x27;ve never been able to get a good, close shave all over my face with any razor.  Apparently, my facial hair is thicker and grows faster than the majority of the rest of the world.  That being said, it really irritates me that I can&#x27;t find a razor that can make me look like I shaved recently.  I have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow an hour after I shave.  That being said, I&#x27;ll stick to the issues I have with this razor I didn&#x27;t have with a blade:  1) It can&#x27;t manage to shave my neck at all.  I have to go over that area with a straight razor after I shave.  2) I now have to use lectric shave pre-shave, which will not come off my face (even after swabbing with alcohol and soap &amp; water).  The oil left behind quickly and obviously is absorbed into my collars.  3) The automatic cleaner doesn&#x27;t register when the cartridge needs changing.  It always says full, even after a month and a nearly-empty (and filthy) cartridge.    I was hoping that this would be a good razor, as spending $6/week on some gimmicky blade is something I&#x27;m not willing to do and the cheaper blades just don&#x27;t cut it (literally).  I thought a $140 razor would do the trick, but I was wrong.  If anybody out there knows of an electric that will actually do what its advertising says, please let me know.</li>
    <li> I was never one for shavers whether they were electric or cordless. I always used Gillette products the best hand shaver the Fusion with multiple blades was the best by far. But now having this Braun 8985 it does a great job that&#x27;s why I have described it as the bomb. I would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting a great shave!</li>
    <li> Pros: easy operation, cuts well.   Cons: The liquid for cleaning just too fast and is already stating replace the foil.</li>
    <li> Much better than the last electric razor I was using (Remington Titanium MS 5500); closer shave, better trimmer, less razor-burn, better cleaning system. Some areas of my face get an excellent close shave, just like a blade. But, after a few weeks, I am still figuring out how to get a good shave without repeatedly going over some areas without irritation. This razor does so well with some places, I&#x27;ve raised my standards for my whole face.  Overall, I&#x27;m happily experimenting with a very good razor &amp; went ahead and bought a years supply of cleaning solution.</li>
    <li> Finally after close to ten years, trips to Iraq, Ethiopia, Cameroon and Cambodia, the switch finally gave out. I had to take it apart it to get it to shut off. I know the series 5 has been discontinued but I will continue to use the Braun family.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Braun user for over a decade using the 7500 Syncro shaver. The 8985 is more quiet and shaves about the same, however, it seems to be more consistent across the whole face. The indication lights for low cleaning solution and which cleaning process is chosen (eco-normal-intensive) is more informative. It has the same difficulty with the lower neck area. Overall it&#x27;s better and keeps me a loyal Braun customer, but not dramatically.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor 2 months ago and I am very satisfied with it. I have had several Braun razors in the past as well as Remingtons, this one is by far the best I have used. I have to make several passes against the grain but after less than five minutes my face feels smooth like a baby&#x27;s butt. My last Braun, 5-6 year ago, never cut close enough for me. I tried a Remington and it was no better, so I used a blade and would get razor burn and break out around my neck area, no burn or break out with this electric razor. I pop the foil and discharge the stubble in the trash after every shave. I clean the razor in the machine 2-3 times a week and after 2 months I have still not changed the cleaning cartridge, it still reads full. I highly recommend this razor!</li>
    <li> Although this is an expensive shaver, the performance is very solid. Powerful motor. Excellent cleaning system. Works just like it said it would.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Christmas for my boyfriend who had a worn out rotary shaver. I spent an entire day researching what the best shaver was, and I am definitely glad I did. It seemed like a lot of money at the time, but both my boyfriend and I agree it&#x27;s completely worth it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;he shaver gives you an exceptionally smooth shave. It works best on hair that is stubbly/not lying against the skin... but, let&#x27;s face it, all electric shavers have that problem. My boyfriend uses it on his face but I&#x27;ve actually taken to using it on my bikini area and it really does a fantastic, FAST job in both places. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system and replace foil notification was really a plus for us, as my boyfriend was the type who would rarely ever clean the hair out of his shaver (or if he did he managed to get it all over the bathroom), always forgot to charge it (and would shave as it made that sad struggling sound uncharged shavers make), and never knew when to replace the blades. Because the base both cleans and charges after each use you never have to get a sub par shave due to clogging or forgetting to charge it. Put simply, it&#x27;s just nice that it maintains itself so you have one less thing to worry about. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Money-saving tip: *As a side note, the cleaning solution is just made up of alcohol and fragrance so we intend to refill the cleaning cartridge with alcohol. They only say not to refill them so you&#x27;ll buy more but it really isn&#x27;t necessary.* &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a really great gift for yourself or a friend. It is kind of pricey but it is so much better than the cheap ones and if you are going to use it every day then you might as well spend a little more and have a quality shave.</li>
    <li> I would have to admit I was a bit dissatisfied about my purchase o. The shield and blades are suppose to last for 18 months but only after 4 months of everyday use the shield started to fall apart.  I purchased the replacement blades and the replacements were of much higher quality than the ones that came with the model.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would say I like the self-cleaning function but with the 150 price tag I believe that the quality control should be much higher.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I would not recommend this product,  less expensive models would do the job just as well and with a 36 dollar price tag on replacement blades, after replacing them a couple of times you could buy a whole new razor.</li>
    <li> I was recently paralyzed from the waste down in a household accident.  My Brother-in-Law gave me this razor in the Rehab.  It&#x27;s was great during my recovering in that I didn&#x27;t have the best balance or coordination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I condition to use it post rehab and love the built in trimmer.  The only negative thing I have to say about the unit is it just doesn&#x27;t shave my neck close enough, but I understand most shavers do I have this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also just had plastic surgery on my lip and chin and the Braun makes it a hell of alot easier to shave around the stitches and bruising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andy, you&#x27;re a great Brother-In-Law, thanks for the great gift.</li>
    <li> I got this as an upgrade from my old Norelco rotary shaver.  I really don&#x27;t notice much difference in shaving performance - it&#x27;s about the same as the rotary and neither are as good as a blade - but that&#x27;s a given for electric shavers.  My main complaint is the clean and renew station - it is big and needs to be plugged in.  I tried leaving it in the bedroom - but it has a pulsing blue LED that my wife hated when trying to fall asleep.  The cleaning station is about the size of a 2 liter soda bottle but 1/2 the height.  There is no stand for just the shaver if you wanted to skip the cleaning station. &lt;br /&gt;The shaver itself I like OK, and you get the 30 day trial from Braun. I am thinking of sending it back and just getting new heads for my old Norelco.  There is a nice travel case - hard clam shell</li>
    <li> This shaver is replacing a Remington Titanium MS5500.  After 18 months, the Remington would no longer hold a charge.  The Braun 8985 has been outstanding so far.  It provides a close cut and is easy on the face.  Also, the cleaning base is the best.  It&#x27;s quiet, cleans completely, and doesn&#x27;t use that much cleaning fluid.  The Remington&#x27;s cleaning fluid was $5, lasted less than a month, didn&#x27;t clean good, and the cleaner was very noisy.  The Braun&#x27;s cleaning fluid is $10 for 2 refills, has lasted two months and still going, cleans great, and is very quiet.  I love it so far.  Spend the extra $$$ and you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
    <li> I never realized how much better this shaver could be over a rotary. I would recommend the Braun 8985 to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers for more years than I care to remember.  The 360 complete seems to shave better than its predecessor.  It works on the longer hair which the other tended to miss.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know, maybe this razor deserves a 5 stars. It is a fine piece of workmanship. I been using it for about a month. I think If it continues to work this well for 7-10 years (like my last Norelco lasted 10 years)Then I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Funny, I read some of the reviews here, and wonder about the people who are reviewing the product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*I own a different razor, but am reviewing this one... &lt;br /&gt;*You can&#x27;t get it wet, but it doesn&#x27;t say that in the product manual... &lt;br /&gt;*You have to replace the \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; cutter/head every 18 months... &lt;br /&gt;*The cleaning stand is too large... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Good grief, is this stuff made up? It cannot be for real, can it? \\&quot;Here&#x27;s your sign...\\&quot; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Did any of these people do ANY research before purchase? You can see this thing in any Wal-Mart or Target in America....I think these are the people who sue companies for having &#x27;Hot coffee&#x27;....sheesh. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Come on, folks, it is a RAZOR! I used a Norelco wet/dry for years, and was never quite satisfied. Too many passes, and the razor burn was bad. So, after dropping it on the floor and breaking it beyond repair, I tried this. With the rebate from Amazon, it was less than a Franklin bill to purchase shipped!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The razor is great! almost as close as a blade. After 6 years in the Navy, where I learned to hate shaving _EVERY DAY_, I am finally doing it again, with no problems. There&#x27;s no &#x27;tug&#x27; like the lift and cut of Norelco, and I get less ingrown hairs, a continuous problem with the lift and cut system. The &#x27;hum&#x27; of the Braun is different than the &#x27;whirr&#x27; of the Norelco, but no louder or more annoying. The cleaning stand is great. I clean all the whiskers from my razor with the brush before putting it in the stand, and then remove the cleaning fluid after cleaning to slow evaporation. I will easily get two months, perhaps 3 from a cleaning cartridge, and that is with 6 days a week shaving (I skip Saturdays). After a trip, the deep clean makes this razor sparkling new!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the long run, a disposable razor, or even a Mach 3 replacable blade, will cost about 50 cents a day. (Including shaving cream, hot water, etc.) Heck, say 20 cents a day. After a year, that 20 cents aday adds up to $70...I got this convenient razor (I use it in the car, at my desk, in the bathroom, etc.) for just a few dollars more than that. Even after replacing the cutters at 18 months, I come out ahead on the $$$. A no-brainer.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Electric razors are environmentally friendlier than disposable razors, cost effective, and just about as close as a blade with the newest technology. Do yourself a favor...get into the 21st century, and buy this razor, or buy a Norelco, but give up the Bic, cheapskate!</li>
    <li> I chose this shaver after reading a number of owner reviews.  After using it for a few weeks, I find that it is well deserving of the glowing comments in those reviews, and that it far exceeds claims by the marketers.  WELL DONE, Braun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried electric razors before and I was never satisfied with how close the shave was not with how my face reacted to it.  However, after researching and debating the pros and cons, I decided to give the Braun 360 a try.  This is a GREAT SHAVER!!!  I have a pretty heavy beard and it grows FAST, and this shaver handles it like a charm.  There has been no skin irritation, and the shave is nice and smooth.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because it still isn&#x27;t as close as shaving with my old Mach 3 razor, but its darn close.</li>
    <li> Basically, this shaver gives me just as close a shave as any high-quality electric shaver.  No better, no worse.  It will never be as close as one of those flashy Gillette blades, though.  I&#x27;m one of those guys with a pretty thick, fast growing beard, so this is a concern for me every morning.  I&#x27;ve definitely gone through my share of various types of electrics and razors. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hands down, there is a huge convenience factor added with the self-cleaning.  No mess. No hassles.  Just drop it in the charger, push the button, and let it do its thing for about an hour. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From a financial standpoint, its a mixed bag when comparing to standard blades.  Your typical Fusion blade costs between $3-$4, and based on the type of beard you have, a single blade can last about a week, give or take.  So per use, its definitely cheaper to go with electric.  However, with such high up-front costs to purchase the Braun, along with changing the cleaning cleaning fluid each month at around $4/each, it will take a few years to break-even. (In fact, if you want to get really technical, with inflation and interest rates considered, you may never really break-even.  I was actually distorted enough to run these calculations in Excel.)  However, from a purely psychological sense, you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re getting robbed each time you have to buy more razors, you just get robbed once. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So, in summary, solid electric shaver, cool added value of convenience, and its kind of your call on whether you think you&#x27;ll be saving money or not.</li>
    <li> Recently my Braun 8585 electric shaver was stolen during a family trip.  I needed to replace it and came across the 8985 model on Amazon.  Very similar but this was the newer model so I expected at the very least, as good quality as the last model. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about a month and even though I had no complaints about the 8585 model, I am truly happy with this purchase.  Both do have a slightly loud cleaning mechanism but since our bathroom is down the hall, it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  Does a great job overall and leaves my face smooth without irritating my skin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pros: &lt;br /&gt;-Does a great job at getting to hair on my neck (under my jaw). &lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;ve taken it on weekend trips a few times and the battery life has been better than expected. &lt;br /&gt;-Love that you can flip the switch and do a quick trim on my sideburns and then go back to finishing shaving. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;br /&gt;-Noisy cleaning may bother some who are sensitive to loud noises. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bottom line...worth the money! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Product works as advertised, super. No complaints.   Was supposed to have been sent a $50 off coupon for use in future purchases.  Have not seen it yet --  five weeks later.    David</li>
    <li> I had a Braun shaver, but I was in need of new head and blade. They are very expensive, so I decided to invest in the 360 Complete model since it had received lots of hype in other reviews. It&#x27;s as good as other Brauns that I have had over the last several years, but perhaps no better. My unit is very noisy. The first few shaves produced longer hairs after a shave. I thought it must be the new Gillette blades. Indeed, the first few shaves did feel closer, but after a week or so, the length of the cut hairs was similar to my previous Braun and perhaps no better than getting a new head a blades. I liked the fact that the cleaner stand was the same as the last models and that the charger works for both.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this one for a while now and it still hasn&#x27;t \\&quot;gotten used to my beard\\&quot; like they claim it will.  I had a pricey norelco electric years ago and went back to manual because is would totally miss the hairs at the bottom of my beard (upper neck).  Well I figured if I spent this much money on one in 2007 it would work, but nope, I still use my fusion after every single shave with this braun to get the parts it misses.  Stick with what works, which is manual.</li>
    <li> I had owned a Braun 7526 shaver for 3 years and was extremely happy with the  performance. It finally broke down and I was looking for replacement. I did not hesitate to upgrade to another Braun after such a great experience. I was not at all disappointed. The newer Braun 8985 is much more quieter than 7526 and the shave is more close. I would highly recommend this to anyone. Dont forget to sign up for the Subscribe &amp; Save for the catridge refill. Amazon&#x27;s price and convenience is worth it.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000G1EQ1W Braun 8995 360 Complete Men&#x27;s Shaver]]I thought the automatic cleaning facility would not be used as I was always very methodical about cleaning my old Braun razor but I have to say I am now a total convert to the automatic cleaning, it is so nice to pick up a fresh clean razor every morning. The new design of cutters for getting long hairs is much better, I always used to have a problem in one part of my neck but not now. The shaver also gives a quieter smoother shave.    I am very pleased with my purchase and as usual with the service from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Well, I do like the braun 8985.  It does a job.  Picture if you were going real quick with your razor and you would have the quality of the braun.  It isn&#x27;t nearly as close as a razor, but it gets there.  If you move to fast with it, you will have patches that are stubby.    My biggest advice is to follow the direction that it comes with.  Shave BEFORE showering, I did not do this once, and it wasn&#x27;t nearly as close of a shave.  I am content with this, unfortunatly, i still have to use my norelco on my lip to get a close shave, even with a regular razor.  But I am content with the Braun 8985 because if i don&#x27;t feel like spending the 15 mins to use my razor, i can use the braun, and it works just about as good as a quick razor shave.    Anyways, overall it is a great product, but definitly does not deserve the credit that everyone is giving it.  Follow the directions on shaving this thing, they say it takes about 3 weeks for your skin to get use to the shave.</li>
    <li> Braun/Gillette hasn&#x27;t learned much about men&#x27;s shaving in the past couple decades, because this highly touted machine shaves a bit worse than the 20-year-old Braun it replaced. Irritates nose and lips, moreover.&lt;br /&gt;  The cleaning system works impeccably. If one puts the cap back on the cleaning solution, it lasts for a year, so the other commentators who complained about evaporation were missing an obvious fix.&lt;br /&gt;  Considering how short a period the 8985 and its cousins were in production, I imagine that Braun received a lot of negative feedback.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver to replace the Remington Triple Screen that I&#x27;ve had for years, and despite some niggly little things that have gone wrong with the Remington over the last couple of years, it&#x27;s been maintenance-free, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with the closeness of the shave.     The second reason that I purchased this shaver was the high (highest) rating that Consumer Reports gave this product. Instead of following my gut instinct and replacing the Remington with another Remington I purchased this shaver, only to later realize that in order to properly maintain this shaver, you are required to purchase the Clean and Renew Refills, so Braun has you digging into your pocket for the life of the product.    And finally, the day after I purchased this product on Amazon, I discovered that Costco sells the same product at the same price, but includes 3 free refill catridges, a $15.50 value (plus tax &amp; shipping).    But the kicker is...the shaver does not shave very closely! (or anywhere near as closesly as my Remington). In fairness to the product, they suggest you use the shaver &#x27;multiple&#x27; times prior to eveluating it&#x27;s performance. I&#x27;ve used it about 9 times already and it does a terrible job of shaving on my neck, and only an average job on my face, despite having followed in close detail all of the recommendations in the instruction manual on how to use and maintain the product.    I&#x27;m anxiously awaiting the highly rated performance from this shaver, but at this stage, the jury&#x27;s still out.</li>
    <li> I have never had a better shaver, only thing is, the cleaning lube is way over-priced in the stores and essentially still keeps you eating out of \\&quot;thier\\&quot; hands. I have to replace the lube way too often.  Other than that, the shaver works great with so many extra features that you expect from Braun. No problems yet...</li>
    <li> I had used Philips (Norelco) rotary shavers for more years than you want to know before I got this Braun.  I thought it looked well made and that it might give me a closer shave than the rotaries.  So I put my money down...  First, what&#x27;s good about it.  Well, it IS well made, very well made.  The materials and construction are unimpeachable.  Also, the cleaning system works well, and leaves the device sparkling, although one might have the suspicion that this is but a clever ruse by Braun to lift more of your green - I mean, do you really NEED it?  ( I haven&#x27;t used mine every day.)  And the razor can give a close and fairly fast shave over most of your face - close enough to deliver you from 5 o&#x27;clock shadow and to appear thoroughly groomed.    What&#x27;s not so good?  I hope you&#x27;re sitting down for this bit.  First, with all that unimpeachable construction, it&#x27;s HEAVY.  Drop this on your foot, you might be having a leg off.  Also, subtracts from your weight allowance if you&#x27;re a frequent air traveler.  Second, it&#x27;s NOISY - sort of like starting a 12HP snowblower in your bathroom.  If you rise early, and your significant other prefers a more relaxed approach to the day, this can lead to an exquisitely vigorous exchange of views in the early hours.  Trust me, I know.  Third, while it can give a close, fast shave on PARTS of your face, there are other parts - round the corner of a nostril, for example, or on one side of your neck - where it has only two approaches, both of them unsatisfactory.  One is to be apparently incapable of trapping and cutting the hair, so that you have to go over and over that part to get a feel something close to what you had in mind.  The other - and it&#x27;s cunning, it does this when you least expect - is to eat a hole in your face.  (And guess what?  Having blood on your shirt in the morning is still a fashion flub that will make you an object of derision for the whole day.  Unless you change, of course...)  Fourth, the running time on one charge is only 50 mins.  This is fine if you&#x27;re not going anywhere because you recharge it when you put it back in its \\&quot;station\\&quot;, but if you are going to be away from home for more than about 4 days, you have to remember to take the power cord with you AND have the right plug adapter for the country you&#x27;re visiting.  This is nuts - with all that heft in the thing, you would think that you could be away for home for at least 10 days without a recharge.  Fifth, it&#x27;s expensive - not the most expensive, but still not cheap.  In the end, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good value.  Sadder but wiser, I&#x27;m going back to Philips.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had an electric shave as close as a blade shave, don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s possible, but the Braun 360 Complete comes close. They always say you have to shave with a new electric 14-21 days to let your face \\&quot;get adjusted,\\&quot; so I&#x27;ve shaved with nothing but the new Braun for the last 21 days. This morning&#x27;s shave is quite close, and since it doesn&#x27;t cut me like a blade occasionally will, I&#x27;ll stick with it. Maybe it will get even closer as my alleged \\&quot;minute scar tissue\\&quot; from blade shaving goes away. It takes a 5 to 8 minutes for a good shave, no longer than with cream and a blade, and the cleaning system seems efficient, if a tad expensive for refills. The jury&#x27;s still out, but if I&#x27;m getting close shaves without cuts one year from now, I&#x27;ll add a star. Update Aug. 15, 2011: Still shaving with it daily 3 years later, it&#x27;s still good, though understandably not shaving quite as close. A light that&#x27;s supposed to tell you when to change the foil and cutter has never come on, so I haven&#x27;t done that, but I&#x27;ve heard changing foil and cutter make the shaver \\&quot;new\\&quot; again.</li>
    <li> I am a sufferer of sensitive skin... particularly right above the neckline. I have tried every possible combination of shaving with a blade and several electric razors. This by far is the best I have used to date. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it&#x27;s not cheap and there is a need for steady supply of cleaning solutions and replacement blades to keep your razor at top performance, however, it has been worth every penny.    I don&#x27;t want you to walk away with the impression that this shaver is the only part of the solution... absolutely not. I still use a shaving lubricant and when I have finished shaving I have to immediately spray my face with an antimicrobial (any type of first aid spray). But this combination has been a winner for me. No longer does shaving have to be a painful ordeal and I don&#x27;t walk around looking like I have a bad case of hives.</li>
    <li> I love this razor but, just as with a half dozen others I&#x27;ve tried, it does not shave quite as close as my Sensor blades with my \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; razor.   However, this one doesn&#x27;t leave stray, flattened hairs untouched as with my most recent Remington Platinum.   The cleaner is a bit bulky but if you pop the razor foil (but still attached) and run it for 5 seconds most shavings fall out, it cleans on \\&quot;economy\\&quot; status which is shorter.  It is left perfectly sanitized with a slight film of light oil on it.  It has two settings for a fixed shaving position or the free floating movement.   I have no idea why it is called \\&quot;360\\&quot; since it only pivots in a back and forth manner and it&#x27;s less than 45 degrees!  The fixed position is better for hard to shave areas which negates the 360 feature.  For me, a less expensive model with the same shaving  head and cleaning system might be just as good.    I somewhat resent the expense of the cleaning cartridges but they last four months for me...  and the need to replace the head after 18 months (or when the machine tells you to.)    I found a plastic container that fits snugly over the unit and prevents much of the  evaporation of the alcohol.  I have modified this review after discovering that the shave is much closer than at first and b/c the cleaning cartridge lasts longer than I thought they would. The cleaning unit senses when it needs to be charged so you don&#x27;t need to give that a thought.  It runs a long time between chargings.    One other very nice feature is that this razor captures all of the shavings unlike others I&#x27;ve had, so you can wander around using it while doing other things without fine whiskers decorating your shirt.    ---  A year later.   I never regularly shaved with an electric until getting this shaver.  It isn&#x27;t blade close  but it&#x27;s close enough for me.   If I&#x27;m going to be out through the evening, I have to use a blade razor to prevent visible stubble.  ---  After 14 months I replaced the foil and cutterbar, and it made a dramatic change in how close it shaves.  I made the change when the light came on indicating to do so.  The replacement unit varies from $40 at a box store to $27 plus shipping through Amazon.  I wish I had taken Amazon&#x27;s automatic replacement policy which is offered for consumables.  It would have saved me 15%, but I hadn&#x27;t felt the benefit of the new cutter bar when ordering.  Changing more often would give you better results....like with a blade razor.    One additional discovery:  the unit will tell you to change the cleaning solution and until recently it was right on target with the container almost empty.  Lately, the red light comes on and it&#x27;s half full.  I just unplug it  and it returns to giving accurate readings.</li>
    <li> I caustion everyone to buy such product. Everything it claims is not true.  The rotary Shavers are much much better in my opinion. The worst thing is that the foil breaks every two months when you use the self cleaning. So why do we pay that much for something that not only does what claims but also requires replacement due to its own fault.</li>
    <li> This razor is excellent, I use it to shave my head daily as well as face and just as smooth as a Mach III with no cuts. The cleaning systyem does a complete job!</li>
    <li> I ordered this shaver for my husband for christmas.  We found that you have to replace the cartridge every month and the head every year.  Each are not cheap and this info was not available at the time of purchase. He finds that it cuts OK, but I was expecting more.</li>
    <li> Upgraded from Remington TCT, this shaver is slightly quieter and doesn&#x27;t tug at the skin the way the Remington did.  Cleaner is noisy, but a welcome alternative to cleaning the old fashioned way.</li>
    <li> I would have to say this is one of the best razors i have used. I have a very complex facial hair design and it works perfectly. Will this replace the razor? No. I sometimes have to use the razor to remove the entire stubble. I can use this razor everyday without the itch of razor burn. My razor blade lasted me a year not the 18 months it said it would. The cleaning system works perfect. If you let your facial hair get long then I would recommend using the build in trimmer before the shaver.</li>
    <li> Short Review:&lt;br /&gt;Beats Norelco and Remington--I have used both manufactures&#x27; top models&lt;br /&gt;Gets neck better then previous electrics--still occasionally need regular blade to bat clean-up though&lt;br /&gt;Overall better design and feel than other razors&lt;br /&gt;The auto clean feature is really nice but does take up a lot of real estate and is loud&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total cost of ownership&lt;br /&gt;- About $145 initial minus the $50 Amazon cash.  I buy from Amazon all the time so the cash is great for me.&lt;br /&gt;- The Cleaners are about $3.90 a piece and last for a little over a month so figure about $43 a year.&lt;br /&gt;- $40 a year for the Foil and Cutter Block&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Figure on about $188 for first year or $15.67 a month (If you do not count Amazon cash)&lt;br /&gt;-- Figure on about $83 for following years or $6.90 a month&lt;br /&gt;-- I only use them for about 3 years so Total Cost for me is $354 minus $50 Amazon Cash for $304 or $8.44 a month for 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better shave then other electrics I have used but still room for improvement with those neck hairs.  The base is large but you do not get the sink mess that comes with other razors and you do not have to oil the blades--auto clean is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice features include the led indicator for when it needs new blades and a battery charge/discharge system that keeps the constant recharging from significantly lowering the battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this razor over all the others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried electric razors off and on over the last two decades and never stuck with it because they just didn&#x27;t come close enough to a blade .. this one does.  My two biggest issues have been maintenance and a close shave; the 360 solves both of these.  I would give it 5 stars but I&#x27;m saving that for the razor that can shave my neck as close as everywhere else.  Of all the razors I&#x27;ve ever tried this is the best so far.</li>
    <li> Shipping was wonderfully fast.  I can only tell you that this was a gift for my 21 year old son, and he requested it.  He has not called me telling me that there is anything wrong with it, so, it must be alright. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had the shaver for a month or so but I absolutely love it.  I absolutely hate shaving.  The razor&#x27;s always give me razor burn and it always seems like I am late for something (sometimes work) because I needed to shave.  With the Braun I can do a quick shave in just a minute or two and I dont&#x27; have to worry about razor burn, shaving cream or keeping sharp razor&#x27;s on hand.  I don&#x27;t even have to clean the Braun with the self cleaning/charging stand that is included.  I would recommend this shaver to anyone.  The only thing is you do have to give your skin/hair a little time to adjust to it just like the manual says.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to preface this review by noting that I recognize differences in facial features likely give different results and experiences... I used the Braun 8985 exclusively as recommended and went beyond the recommended break-in period for three weeks, going for over three months.  The Braun did a good job in the middle of the sides of my face and the sideburn area as well.  I tried various recommended techniques to stretch the skin to get those pesky ingrown whiskers, but to little avail.  The only way I could get the ingrowns with this razor was to use the pop up trimmer... by the way, this is definitely not a recommended technique, rather a desperation move to get the ingrowns out so I could get them with the shaver and stay true to the commitment of not using another razor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This brings me to why I tried electric: I get razor burn rather easily and using something that cuts close enough without taking a layer of skin with it sounds really appealing...(pun intended)  Plus, the rising costs of blades allows easy justification to try the gadetry.  So, I put the 8595 through the paces and it did a reasonably good job, but there were things that made me continue to search for greener pastures: &lt;br /&gt;1) No amount of stretching my face and different attack angles could get the area along the jaw-line right below the side-burn area near the ears. &lt;br /&gt;2) The same problem existed right below the chin but before the neck leaving me with three shadow-like patches.  I could feel the whiskers popping out in those areas, but could not seem to get an angle on them. &lt;br /&gt;3) I mentioned this earlier, but to elaborate, there were numerous ingrown whiskers taking over my neck.  The only shaving related issue in my book, worse than razor burn, is ingrown hair.  It looked like a pimple factory. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My favorite feature on the Braun 360 is the pop-up trimmer.  It&#x27;s great for tiding up a beard and sideburns.  Also, it great for removing those unsightly nose hair. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, the Braun 360 Complete 8985 may be the right razor for some people, but it was definitely not the right razor for me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Today, I purchased a Norelco Smart Touch 9190-XL for 20% off the $199.99 tag at a nearby national chain.  I tested it briefly under less than ideal conditions and I must say that I&#x27;m impressed so far...  I was in a hurry to make it to my next appointment, and my skin was somewhat moist and sticky from perspiration.  I used the highest sensativity setting and got wonderful results with a very comfortable shave.  I&#x27;ll leave the verdict out on the ingrowns until after a few days as I&#x27;ve been using a Gillete Fusion since giving up on the Braun.  One of the things I noticed about the Braun was that it seemed really good at first and then the ingrown whiskers started taking over my neck.  Initial impressions on the Norelco are really good, but I&#x27;ll save the rest of those comments for that review after I have a chance to use it over a period of time.</li>
    <li> After my husband bought his fifth Norelco rotary in 4 years and was ready to purchase his sixth, I told him I would go online and do some research on other electric razors available.  When I read the great reviews on the Braun 360 I decided to order one for him.    He resisted trying the razor for a couple of months and it sat unpacked in the box despite his lack of good shaves.  Finally the time had come, his rotary was making his skin sore and it took 1/2 hour for him to get a mediocre shave.  The first time he tried it he said it was the best shave he had in his life but was still skeptical that it wouldn&#x27;t last.  A month later he still loves the shave and is a full convert. Closer and shorter time with less irritation is what he says. He loves the cleaning feature, since his Norelcos took an hour to clean with a small brush.     He has a rough beard and with the rotary use to have a shadow by 4 pm.  Now his face looks and feels smooth until late at night.    I highly recommend this as a gift to the men in your life.    Update:  Not even one year later, husband has gone through 3 heads and shave is not close anymore. At the recommendation of a professional he has switched to a Panasonic Pro-Curve and the shave is amazing.  He is using it wet with a shave gel and he doesn&#x27;t need to shave everyday.  No nick, cuts, bleeds anymore.  The Braun was a waste of $$$.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had and used several Braun electric shaving products over the years and I can state unequivocally thiis is by far superior to any other.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun razors for many years now (several models) and I can say that this one is by far the best I&#x27;ve yet used.  It shaves as close (or maybe a bit closer) as the others, it&#x27;s very quiet compared to previous models and the cleaner/charger base is a handy way to store the razor.  I only clean the razor once a week.  Also, I get around the cleaning-solution-evaporation problem by taking the cleaning fluid cartridge out (and re-capping) after every cleaning.  I&#x27;m also looking into using just straight denatured alcohol instead of the stock solution (supposedly just SD alcohol and fragrance).    Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my husband. He has been using it for 8 months. I have started to look for another shaver since the shaver does not cut the hair close enough, especially on the neck. We thought that he just needs to get used to this type of shaver and it will get better. It did not.</li>
    <li> I have owned several Philips/Norelco shavers before, plus everyone at one time or another has had a Remington of some sort, and I must say that the Braun 360 Complete is the best shaver that I have owned so far.  Here is why: I have hairs on my neck that are very difficult to shave with any razor that I have had previously, because the hair lies fairly close to the skin and grows at an angle.  I have always had to go back and retrace all the strokes on my neck with a blade.  So why shave with an electric, and then follow up with a blade?  It didn&#x27;t make sense to me, so I thought I&#x27;d give the electrics one more shot with a different brand that claimed to trim all those troublesome neck hairs, hence the Braun 360 Complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad that I made the choice to stick with an electric.  This shaver helps me SAVE TIME by not having to follow up with any blade.  The Gillette blades on this shaver shave extremely close with fewer strokes, and having the cleaning solution built into the stand takes the guesswork out of the cleaning process.  Amazon also has a good price on the refills for the cleaning solution, so I am not out too much money for the refills.  I am definitely glad that I made this purchase, and if this razor lasts as long as is should, and performs at this same level for as long as I own it and replace the blades / foil when needed, I will be a happy shaver.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever bought. I still don&#x27;t think it is quite as good as a straight razor but pretty close.</li>
    <li> My previous razor was a Panasonic linear model, which provided an excellent shave almost immediately. I really liked the idea of having a cleaning system, and Braun is known for its quality. The type of screen and cutting blades is very similar to my old razor, so I hoped the transition would be rapid and smooth (no pun intended!)&lt;br /&gt;So far, the quality of shaves have been underwhelming. I&#x27;ve followed instructions to the letter, and haven&#x27;t been pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;So, I hesitate to recommend this razor to anyone seeking a close, smooth shave...you&#x27;ll be disappointed. (The cleaning system works okay, and the blue lights on the razor and base look cool...but I shoulda stuck with the Panasonic brand!)</li>
    <li> Love this shaver! This is a replacement for an older Braun which I also liked a lot. However, the cleaning unit on the old one quit working after about 5 years and so I decided to try a newer model. I am not sure that it works any better than the older one but it seems to do better on those loner whiskers that tend to lay close to my neck. Conceptually, the idea of a self cleaning shaver is great and I wouldn&#x27;t want a shaver I had to clean. Don&#x27;t know if this unit will be more reliable than the last one but the cleanner mechanism does look to be more robust. The old shaver was still working fine and I would still have it today if only the cleaner base had not quit.</li>
    <li> OK - dirty little secret here - I am hirsuit. I have thick hair that tends to be curly and electric shavers have always left me wanting.    About a year ago I finally broke down about bought the Braun 8985 360 complete. This was literally the last shaver I planned to but. I had been through Norelcos, Bruans, Phillips, and other - and always ended up going back to a blade after 2-3 months. Nothing would cut my neck hair and most just burned my neck with all of the repetitive strokes trying to get the neck hair.    I am very happy to report that after a year - I still love this shaver. It isn&#x27;t perfect - I still have few straggling hairs, but I would not give up this shaver for anything. Especially when used daily, it is a dream - fast and smooth (much better than any blade I have used) and finally . . . NO MORE RAZOR BURN*    * The only time I still get razor burn is when I go more than 2 days without shaving - then it takes about 10 minutes to completely shave and my neck may get a little raw. But using an astringent (like Norelco after shave or Skin Bracer) keep the rash to a minimum and it usually is gone by the next day.    All in all - I feel this is the finest razor (at least for people like me that have to have a clean shave every day, wear collared shirts that rub freshly shaven skin, and have heavy/curly beard hairs).</li>
    <li> My husband has had several Braun razors.He continues to buy them because they cut his very tough beard well and cleaning and charging the razor is very convenient. However,  previous models&#x27; cleaners have not lasted as long as they should, given the price of the razor. Also, the cleaning supplies are expensive. Unless this model is a big improvement on its predecessors this is NOT a cheap razor brand to buy or own.</li>
    <li> Shaver does a good job, but the cleaning base/charger is failing after less than one year. Called Cust Service, was told had to send to repair facility; none in our state. Means a long time without the razor. Asked to speak with Cust Service Mgr, was told would get same answer. Another non-caring vendor,no more Braun products for me.</li>
    <li> I tried several electrics in the past and could never get a shave that was even close to adequate. My dermatologist wanted me to try an electric again, so I decided to spend the bucks and get the best I could find, and hope it worked. After about 3 weeks of practice, I was finally getting a decent shave. If I want to stay fairly smooth, I&#x27;d have to do it again in the afternoon sometime, but usually once in the morning is fine. It isn&#x27;t an instant shave. It takes me a while to get all the stubble growing in the different directions, but I can get there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I either didn&#x27;t read it or forgot it, but I noticed the other day that the head wasn&#x27;t swiveling. Then I saw there were two \\&quot;on\\&quot; positions for the razor, plus one for the clipper. It goes: off-&gt; on (w/swivel)-&gt; fix (no swivel)-&gt; clipper. Can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t notice that for several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the auto clean but hate the expensive disposable cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take the foil off after each shave and tap it and the razor lightly on the sink to knock out the hairs before putting it back in the base. Then I hit the clean button about every 3 shaves (or immediately if it registers &#x27;intense&#x27; on the base).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to refill the cartridges instead of spending $5 or $6 a piece and throwing away the perfectly good plastic cartridge every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients in the cleaning solution are: denatured alcohol, limonene, citral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Denatured alcohol is just ethanol (same as liquor) with a poison added to make it undrinkable. Really - a poison. If they denature it, they don&#x27;t have to pay liquor taxes. The denatured alcohol in U.S. hardware stores is denatured with Methanol (wood alcohol). Methanol is seriously toxic. But I&#x27;m not sure that it would be a problem. The razor has a drying cycle that would evaporate both the ethanol and the methanol. Besides - the concentrations we&#x27;d contact from the razor and base are very low. \\&quot;Dose is the difference between medicine and poison\\&quot;. Get too much of one thing and it can poison you (salt, caffeine, water,...), small doses are usually not a problem for many toxic substances. They use this ethanol methanol mixture as the fuel to heat chafing (keeps food warm) dishes and fondue pots also. I&#x27;m really not sure what to think about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other ingredients are Limonene and Citral. Limonene is a terpene. Terpenes are great. They get them from plant oils. The most common is d-limonene. It is usually extracted from orange peels and smells wonderful. It works as a solvent in full concentration (a couple of wipes with a paper towel, took some adhesive goo off my kitchen floor that I&#x27;d tried to get off with many different cleaners) and a general purpose cleaner when diluted. It even shows up in cosmetics, some foods and is in some hand soaps to add that nice citrus smell, and lots of other places. They can use it to clean factory machines. It&#x27;s a great degreaser and doesn&#x27;t release CFC&#x27;s like the chemical cleaners. It&#x27;s safer for the staff also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m guessing the limonene, besides cleaning away the skin oils, is  a lubricant also. It has a bit of an oiliness to it. It adds a great orange citrus smell too. I don&#x27;t use much. Really only about 1/100th of a cent worth, but I have no idea what the proper amount to use is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also using the denatured alcohol with methanol. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s safe yet, so don&#x27;t trust me on that. The denatured alcohol doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as the cleaning fluid. They probably use another agent to denature the alcohol in their cleaning fluid. I wish I could get pure ethanol. Maybe I should try Everclear?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the cleaning/drying cycle, the razor smells almost exactly the same as with the purchased cartridges. The citral in the ingredients is a fragrance and I decided - for me - it was probably optional, so I haven&#x27;t tried to track it down. I bought d-limonene at greenterpene dot com. (d-limonene smells like oranges, l-limonene smellslike turpentine - I&#x27;m pretty sure they use the d-limonene).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rinse the cartridge with a little alcohol to get the hair out - I don&#x27;t use water - because water can corrode metal. Then I fill it with about $1.25 worth of the alcohol and a tiny amount of limonene. The cartridge holds 175ml-it&#x27;s on the label. I had a full one and just scratched a line on the side so I&#x27;d know how much to add. Seems to be working well for me, but I really can&#x27;t recommend it as I don&#x27;t know about the methanol issue. I&#x27;ll let you know if my ears fall off. Or if the razor has problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t use drugstore Isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol). It has water, acetone, methyl isobutyl ketone, denatonium benzoate - a bittering agent, sometimes fragrance and coloring agents, plus other stuff - there are different recipes depending on the manufacturer. I&#x27;m afraid of all those extra ingredients harming the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, that&#x27;s my recipe. I really can&#x27;t recommend it though until I find out about the methanol issue, although I like it. If someone finds a pure ethyl alcohol that is denatured with something milder, let me know. Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I do love the razor.he cartridge with a little alcohol to get the hair out - I don&#x27;t use water - because water can corrode metal.

    <li> I have been a BRAUN loyalist for many years and the latest model has an improved motor, blades and design. The quiet blades provide a very close, comfortable shave and easy to hold and manuver around face and neck. The included electric cleaner system seems unnecessary, but will see if it extends the life of the blades. BRAUN is at the top of electic shavers for a close and comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I am not impressed with the closeness of the shaves, even after the recommended \\&quot;beard adjustment\\&quot; time.  For the money, I expected better.  Cleaning with the base is nice, but I wonder if it is just a gimmick to sell more product.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver. All I can say is WOW!. It shaves as close it can  be and is very smooth. I no longer have to endure the rough facial skin that razors gave me after every shave. I bid a very fond and emotional farewell to my Gillette MACH3. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The shaver itself is very easy to handle and is well designed. Like the cleaning system, though it may be an overkill. Cleaning using a brush and gentle tap will do it too. Great buy and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I shave everyday and thus have used many electric shavers in my time.  I have found that the Braun self-cleaning shaver is the best.  It gives me the closest shave and also has that great self-cleaning unit which completely cleans and lubricates the shaver.  The reason why I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is because the cleaning cartridges are quite expensive and basically need to be replaced every month.  One way to make them last longer is to clean your shaver by every other use rather than everytime.</li>
    <li> I owned a Braun 8585 for a bit more than two weeks when I saw the 8995 advertised... with a slick new \\&quot;short hair\\&quot; lifter and a Gillette blade replacing the conventional cutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I quickly eBayed the nearly new 8585 and picked up the 8995 and, guess what? Not much difference. In fact, I&#x27;d swear the 8585 gave me smoother finish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cosmetically the colors and graphics have changed, but the shaver and base station mostly unchanged. The shaver has a new LED to indicate when the foil and cutter should be replaced, but in my experience, the way the shaver tugs on my face is normally indication enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blue \\&quot;short hair lifter\\&quot; strip is a bit of a gimmick -- the Braun website makes it appear as if it moves, but it really just sits on top of the screen and vibrates freely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer mentioned, the screen and new Gillette cutter can be installed on an older 8585 -- the part numbers listed in the manual are identical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver replaces an old Panasonic wet/dry which was diminishing in battery life, and for which I could no longer buy original cutting screens (a rubber hair lifter strip had gone by the wayside). I regretfully acknowledge that the Panasonic shaved closer, but this Braun isn&#x27;t far behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the Clean &amp; Renew system is a nice concession! No more stubble dust on the sink, and a nice citrus fragrance greets me each morning. The system automatically selects whether \\&quot;eco\\&quot;, \\&quot;normal\\&quot; or \\&quot;intensive\\&quot; cleaning is called for each time the shaver is returned to the base station, and it is the users option as to whether cleaning should begin, or can wait until another time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleaning selection is a somewhat inconsistent selection, by the way: A weekend&#x27;s growth quickly removed on a Sunday night nets an \\&quot;eco\\&quot; cycle, while a more thorough (longer duration) yet smaller quantity A.M. shave the following morning suggests a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; cleaning (meaning more Clean &amp; Renew formula is expended). This selection is likely based purely on time in use, and you can&#x27;t step back. That is, you can&#x27;t select \\&quot;eco\\&quot; if the shaver recommends \\&quot;normal\\&quot; (short of hitting the Reset button on the shaver, I suppose).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, no big deal, as I am a couple weeks over one month and my original cartridge is still in place. (Users in dryer climates may see quicker replacement intervals as the alcohol-based cleaning fluid readily evaporates).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, travel is a pleasure! As others have mentioned, the base unit stays at home, and the cord plugs directly into the shaver. The hard travel case and screen protector are both welcome features as I have had shavers power on while stashed in my luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I wished for a slightly closer shave with this Braun, but I&#x27;m pretty pleased with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit (10/2/06): Short hairs on my neck have turned out to be more problematic with this shaver than my old Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I indicated in my original write-up, I am now convinced I received a closer shave along the jaw from the Braun 8585 I used briefly before purchasing this 8985 360° complete model. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s due to the change to the new Gillette cutter block, or if it&#x27;s luck of the draw, but with the 8985 it&#x27;s definitely an increased investment in time (by a few minutes) to shave each morning.n use, and you can&#x27;t step back.

    <li> shave ever for my husband, but he is disappointed that this shaver doesn&#x27;t seem to shave as close as his old Wet/Dry Panasonic. He has only been using this new one for about two weeks, &amp; hoped it would get better as he uses it, but the shave hasn&#x27;t improved yet &amp; he misses his wet/dry capability - so guess I picked the wrong gift. Thought since the Braun was rated so well in the reviews I&#x27;d read, that the Braun might be a good change for him, but my mistake... Apparently the Panasonic is better for him at a much lower price.</li>
    <li> My husband is enjoying his new shaver that he recieved for Christmas.  The blades cut smoothly and there is little mess to deal with.  With a quick flick of a button you can toss your shaved hair out of the blades easily and then a quick placement of the shaver into the cleaning base allows it to be even more thoroughly cleaned.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only drawbacks to the shaver are: &lt;br /&gt;1) The cleaning base is a little loud.  You can hear it several rooms away. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2) The price of the cleaning solution that the base uses is rather pricy because it needs to be replaced every three months.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But over all the shaver is excellent.</li>
    <li> This gives a better shave than the Norelco I had.  The clean after every shave is  pretty cool and drives my cat nuts since it turns on and off by itself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Good Gift and very functional.</li>
    <li> I found this to be the easiest site to shop on. The prices cannot be beat. It is user friendly, and my packages arrived when they had said they would. I now look at this site first for anything that I need. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Tried this shaver after having rotaries in the past.  Was drawn to the cleaning feature.  After two weeks shaving was taking way too long, not very good and caused considerable irritation, particular on the neck.  I don&#x27;t have a thick beard, but hairs grow sideways and believe that was a problem for this type of razor.  Stand was nice and workd well.  Didn&#x27;t find very easy to hold either, shape not good and too large.  Purchased Norelco 9160XL and am happier with it os far.</li>
    <li> I have been using razor since Christmas. Shaves without burning, but not a very close shave.I still have to use hand razor to get a clean shave on neck.</li>
    <li> There is no better than this in the world of electric razors. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My advice, use williams preelectric first, wait five minutes, shave.  I have a thick face of hair and it does great.  For the under the chin area that is so difficult here is the secret trust me.... Shave slowly along the chin area from the ear to the point of your chin.  Do that on the right side of the neck area and the left side of the neck area and you will be surprised at the difference in the shave.  Then shave it from the neck up once to catch the remaining hairs (this is the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; shave direction with a blade).  The shave from the ear to the point of the chin is counter intuitive for a blade shaver but it shaves the whiskers blade close trust me try it.</li>
    <li> I have a tough beard and have tried a number of electric razors over the years without any positive results. I have always needed a good hot shower before shaving with my Gillette (whatever the latest Turbo Mach something or other). I was about to leave on an international trip and I was worried about the availability of that \\&quot;good hot shower.\\&quot; I decided to give the Braun a try, based on some positive reviews here and on the fact that a \\&quot;really\\&quot; close blade-type shave was not a requirement on my trip.    I have to say that I am really delighted. While it does not give the same smooth-to-the-touch shave as a shaving-cream-and razor, it is more than acceptable for day-to-day use, both from an appearance and \\&quot;feel\\&quot; standpoint. I travelled abroad for 10 days, used the Braun once or twice a day without recharging, and was very happy with results. I did not take the cleaning unit with me since the liquid in it could not be packed in my luggage, but I used the brush every day to clean the shaving head and the razor performed very well.     Since returning from my trip, I have continued to clean the shaving head daily and I use the full cleaner cycle about twice a week. I can not notice any difference in the quality of the shave after using the full cleaner cycle, and after more than a month of that routine the cleaner still shows a \\&quot;full\\&quot; status.</li>
    <li> Although I have had this shaver for only ten days, I am quite pleased with it. After using a rotary shaver for many years I wasn&#x27;t sure of what to expect. For no more time in front of my mirror, I feel that I receive a much closer shave. The battery life seems to be excellent as I have yet to recharge since the initial charge.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I have found during 25 to 30 years of electric shaving!</li>
    <li> I used a blade for over 30 years before buying this product.  I&#x27;ve tried other electric razors but never found one that shaved close enough.  I&#x27;ve now been using the Braun exclusively for six weeks.  No more cuts, nicks and scrapes.  No mess in the bathroom.  And the shave is almost as close as a blade.  I&#x27;m never going back.</li>
    <li> Maybe I am doing something wrong, but I just don&#x27;t like this shaver as much as everyone else.  I have to go over the same spots so many times and press very hard against my skin to get rid of under-chin hairs.  My skin is irritated after shaving, and the results are spotty as this shaver is unable to give me a clean shave.  Also, if anything goes wrong, Braun service is slow and unhelpful.  Overall, I think this shaver is overpriced and mediocre at best.  The cleaning system is the best part.</li>
    <li> If you want a convenience of the electric shaver, you should definitely look into the Braun line. It is good and solid product, which is very easy to use. It shaves clean and fast. It is the right size and weight. Holds the charge enough for a small trip. &lt;br /&gt;The only side effects are: &lt;br /&gt;- you have to get used to the foil. I&#x27;ve been using mine for more then a month and it still burns the skin after you are done. (opposite to the razor which might hurt a little when you shave, but completely cool afterwords) &lt;br /&gt;- charging/cleaning base is big and somewhat useless. I think simply corded model would be the smarter buy. &lt;br /&gt;- not as good as Gillette Mach 3. With Braun I have to shave every day, period. With Mach 3 razor I can usually skip a day without any problems. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This is a very good shaver.  It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and comfortable on the skin.  It shaves quickly and is not too loud.  The cleaning system is easy to use once you figure it out.  The shaver comes with a hard travel case that is nice.  My only complaints revolve around the cleaning system.  These are more of nit-picks and should not discourage people from buying it.  I had to read the 1/2 page instructions several times to figure out how to clean it.  You put the shaver in the base and push down on the blue button.  Depending on how dirty the shaver is it can take 5-30 minutes to clean.  Oh, and it&#x27;s pretty loud while cleaning so don&#x27;t do this when your wife is sleeping.  To clean it seems to alternate between flowing cleaning fluid through the blades, and running the blades.  So it&#x27;s quiet for a minute then loud for 30 seconds, then it seems to dry for 5 minutes and start the cycle over.  When it&#x27;s finally done you push the blue button again to release it.  I bought it about a month ago and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Purchased this shaver because I wanted a good comfortable shave and, yes this is the tool!     Very good shave: not too short or long and no razor burn.  Sideburns stay even and straight, furthermore the ingrown hairs have all but disappeared.    I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I like my new Braun 8985.  It&#x27;s a replacement for my older 7526 model (almost 5 yrs old).  Based on the advertising and cost, I was hoping for more of an advance from the older model--I am just a little disappointed.  The technological advance appears to be in the recharging and cleaning, not its shaving performance.  The shaving is still very good--I&#x27;m happy for that.  But I had hoped it would be more effective/efficient that my older model -- it&#x27;s just as good.  I am, however, disappointed at the recharging process.  There is no way to have the shaver just clean and not recharge (so as to keep the battery from shortening its lifespan).  You can either use the cleaner and apparently have the system automatically charge, or not clean/recharge.  There&#x27;s no \\&quot;clean without recharge\\&quot; option as there was in my older 7526 version.  Not bad, but not as good as I had hoped after paying $140 or so.</li>
    <li> Great shave and I don&#x27;t have to clean it. I&#x27;ve had noisy shavers in the past, and this thing is not very loud.</li>
    <li> This review will feature a comparison of several shavers I&#x27;ve tried recently, including the Braun. But this is really a review for the Braun 8975 (aka \\&quot;550\\&quot; Series 5, 360 Complete), which I bought recently. But there is no difference with the 8985, except for the cleaning station. So I won&#x27;t comment on use of the cleaning base, other than to say I&#x27;ve always just brushed my electric shaver blades dry, and never felt the need to go beyond that. The fact that you can rinse the heads under running water seems to make all the fuss of creating a space for the rather large cleaning base even more unnecessary. However, it is necessary if you think the executives at Proctor &amp; Gamble need to upgrade their BMW&#x27;s, from the profits of you buying their cleaning solution kits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out my review on the newer Series 5 Braun, the 590cc. In comparison with this older Series 5 model (8975), I prefer this one. Number one, I found that for sure it shaves at least as well as the newer model, but as far as I can tell, it appears to shave a bit closer. As mentioned in the 590cc review, I can only go so far in terms of close shaves with that model, no matter how many passes I make. With the 8975, and as many passes as necessary, it seems I can get a tad closer than I could with the newer model. (I should mention this one was bought used and was a few years old, while the 590cc was bought brand new). This older model is also heavier and perceptibly, less cheaply made. I like that. It won&#x27;t win any design awards (or rather, shouldn&#x27;t), but I still find I prefer the design of this model to its newer equivalent. Like the 590cc, its pretty kind to my sensitive skin (now red and sore in places from trying various shavers and their trimmers!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Braun name, because of their stellar designs of the 20th century. Although Braun today is not the same company or designs of yesteryear. Nevertheless, despite being a Philishave user for all the years prior to last week, I definitely have a new-found prejudice toward the Braun shaver name. But I dug out my two old Philips shaver models, and started to compare them to the Braun 8975. The first is the Philips 4821, and the other is a more higher end but even older (1990?) Philishave 955. I stopped using the 955 years ago, because the 4821 appeared to have a stronger motor and shave better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, my more careful recent tests have shown me that the 955 is actually better than the newer 4821. I think at least part of that reason is the 955 is a heavier shaver. The weight of the shaver presses more deeply against the skin as it passes, and makes for a closer shave. This may well be why the heavier Braun 8975 appears to shave closer than the lighter 590cc. But, I found the Philishave 955 superior to the Braun 8975. With the 955, in no time I could get a shave on any part of my face, that was so close that you felt no stubble at all when brushing up with your hand. So-called \\&quot;baby&#x27;s bottom\\&quot; smooth (the shave was just a touch rougher on the skin than the Braun 8975 or 950cc). Since that is the ultimate that you can expect from a shave, no matter which method you use, I have to give the Philips 955 a 5-star rating. I think the fact that you can shave in circles with the rotary shavers gives it an advantage over the foil type. That action seems to catch and pull the skin better, that can result in a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note, the 955 is an old shaver that must be around 23 years old (I have NEVER changed its shaving heads), does not have the latest foil or technology buzzwords, does not have the latest \\&quot;3D\\&quot; flexi-head design, does not shave wet, does not even have NiMh batteries, is probably worth $10 on the used market today, yet it shaves better than the $400 Braun 8985 and every other Braun or Philips shaver I&#x27;ve tried. And it costs you 0 cents per year in cleaning station fluids. So DONT BUY BUZZWORDS. Sure, you can say electric shaver technology has advanced over the years --but that does not mean it has progressed! Of course, this finding is all very disappointing to me, because I wanted to stick with a Braun shaver!  What I might do is just keep my old classic design Braun 5561 out in the open in my bathroom, for decoration. Then hide the Philips 955 in a cabinet somewhere for when I actually want to shave!</li>
    <li> This is a worthless piece of crap. The cleaning mechanism stopped consistently \\&quot;recognizing\\&quot; the shaver after about 6 months then it finally died. The shaver was decent. Not nearly as close as shaving manually, and only slightly better than my old Braun 7505. Be careful on this one!</li>
    <li> Razor works fairly well. Its nice having the self cleaning option but it does not shave as close as a blade (of course what elect will.) Battery lasts a long time and it is quieter than the older versions.</li>
    <li> I have used many shavers over the years this one is incredibly effective.  I have sensitive skin that makes using a regular razor more than 2x/ week impossible therefore I need to use an electric shaver.  I am usually quite disappointment by the performance of electric shavers.  This one is the exception, I love this thing.</li>
    <li> MY HUSBAND WAS SO THRILLED WITH THIS NEW BRAUN SHAVER!! THIS WAS A SPECIAL GIFT FOR HIM!! HE LOVES IT.</li>
    <li> The Braun Series 5 electric shaver is very good. It certainly beats all other electrics and even beats the blade shave. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband eight years ago, it&#x27;s been a great workhorse for him!! But it&#x27;s not holding it&#x27;s charge so well now &amp; the pop-up trimmer has gone haywire and doesn&#x27;t want to go back into place &amp; shutoff all that easy, so time to get a new Braun! Again, great razor! But I only paid &amp;100.00 new at Target eight years ago.</li>
    <li> I switched to Braun about 8 years ago.  I always like the latest and greatest in technology.  I just placed an order for the 8985, and this will probably be my 5th Braun.  I don&#x27;t like the fact the screen/blades wear out after about 6 months (even though they advertise 18 months).  I do like the fact that the shaver gets a thorough cleaning every day, which provides a brand new shaver every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get absolutely no razor burn, but I have seen reviews that suggest otherwise on this paticular shaver.  I&#x27;ll update this review if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have faith in this company/shaver as I used Norelco and other brands for 30 years and never got a close shave and always had razor burn.</li>
    <li> I have owned several Braun shavers over the last several years. I love the automatic cleaning system and Braun has done a good job of improving how the system functions. And, of course, the shaving performance keeps getting better with each new model. The 8985 is just amazing: Smooth, close, no nicks, and quiet. I have a very tough beard and the 8985 gives me the closest shave I have ever had.</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt;Please do not believe the hype in this shaver.  This is an expensive shaver which does not give you a close shave.  I contacted Braun customer service, and all they did was to send me a foil and cutter which had the same problem of not giving me a clean shave.  The only thing that works in this shaver is the cleaning system.  Honestly, this is not a good buy for your bucks..</li>
    <li> This shaver does give a very nice, close and painless shave.  But although this shaver shaves closer than my old Braun, it takes many more \\&quot;passes\\&quot; on the area to get there.  The main reason I gave this shaver a lower rating of 3 stars, however, is the cleaning system.  This system leaves some kind of residue on the foil which then gets on your face.  Then, when you lick your lips, or if someone kisses your cheek, you are in for a nasty, bitter, foul surprise.  It is SO bad that I now have to wash my face every time after I shave.  This extra step is a real PAIN!!!  Again, the quality of the shaver and the shave is nice, but the cleaning system has a real big flaw.</li>
    <li> My wife bought me this razor as a Christmas gift and I&#x27;ve now given it a half year of use to review.  It is a replacement for an older Panasonic ES8066 that I owned for many years until I dropped and broke it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the shave is comparable to the shave I had with the Panasonic, the issues I have are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-  The foil tends to rub under my nose during the shave and leave it red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2-  While the shave is good, it&#x27;s no better than some razors you can get for cheaper and nowhere near the closeness of a blade.  For some reason, I seem to be having trouble getting a close shave in some areas of my face with this razor.  I never had that issue with Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3-  The gimmicky aspect I HATE is that it uses these cleaning cartridges that evaporate all by themselves.  My old Panasonic was a wet/dry that I could adequately clean in water.  The cleaning solution for this is SD40 alcohol and the old cartridge cannot be cleaned and refilled.  It&#x27;s going to wind up costing you to keep this thing.  More than it&#x27;s worth I feel.  The alcohol bath it gives, however, does make the razor clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4-  The clean cycle takes long and I&#x27;m not sure the \\&quot;cleanliness sensor\\&quot; works properly.  When my first cartridge ran out, I cleaned the razor and foil in alcohol until it was spotless inside and out.  The sensor, however, said it needed an intensive clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5-  The recharger/cleaning base is somewhat large and takes up more bathroom counter real estate than I would like.  Since it&#x27;s circular, it doesn&#x27;t fit squarely in a corner.  If you somehow tip it or it gets pushed into the sink....there goes your cleaning solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6-  When the cleaning solution is not cleaning, it&#x27;s evaporating (as alcohol does) in your bathroom.  I&#x27;m not sure I need any more chemicals in the air filtering through my lungs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I would have preferred a simple razor that just needs to be plugged in once a week or so for recharging and could be used in the shower and cleaned in water.  I hate being forced into buying any extra supplies to maintain an electric razor.  If this thing breaks, I will not be buying another one like it.r and cleaned in water.  I hate being forced into buying any extra supplies to maintain an electric razor.  If this thing breaks, I will not be buying another one like it.</li>
    <li> The shaver does a good job except under the lower sides of my jaw. The cleaner is grossly overpriced. I will make my own. The shaver does a better job than my 15 year old Remington but it should for the money I paid for it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got sensitive skin, shaving with razors (Gillette etc.) irritated my skin to the point I wasn&#x27;t able to shave more than once every approx. 5 days. I used another Braun shaver before but I couldn&#x27;t get a close shave with it and my skin was \\&quot;burning\\&quot; after each shave for a few hours. Before buying the Braun 8985 I said to my wife: \\&quot;If this doesn&#x27;t work out I&#x27;m not getting any shavers in my life and I&#x27;ll just suffer through the rest of it.\\&quot; Well, the first shave didn&#x27;t impress me at all, the second was better, the third even better and so it continued to the point where I actually look forward to shaving now! No skin irritation AT ALL, I get a shave almost as close as with a razor, and I can shave every day (but I choose to shave every other day)! Give this shave a chance if you&#x27;re like me, I know it&#x27;s not on the cheap side (in my home country of Slovakia it sells for about $250 though!!!) but I don&#x27;t regret taking the risk.  So, for me, this is a 5 star shaver!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a rotary for decades, but I like Braun products so I decided to give their shaver a try.  Yes, it did take me a while to get accustomed to a non-rotary, and yes the cleaning process involves a little noise, but it isn&#x27;t objectionable.  And yes, I will have to buy replacement clearning solution.  But in the past two weeks I&#x27;ve decided it is all well worth it.</li>
    <li> very good product. I was thinking the price was a little high but this shaver delivers as advertised!</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Braun within the last 10 years.  I have tried other brands, but they just don&#x27;t measure up.  The Braun gives me the closest and most comfortable shave ever.  Also, the cleaning/recharging system works very well.</li>
    <li> I have this shaving machine for 3 months and I am very satisfied with it. It is the best shaver I have ever had. It took 2 shavings for my skin to get used to it. After that I never had any problem whatsoever. I use the cleaning system after every 3 shavings and my skin is never irritated.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with my Braun 360.  It shaves considerably closer than my old Norelco rotary even when I changed new blades.  I also like the self cleaning feature, tho I am cleaning it every other day to prolong the cleaning cartridge.  It was an expensive purchase but I am not disappointed.  As to being loud, it is louder than the rotary but not a problem.</li>
    <li> Why trade off a COMPLETE shave for a close shave?  Sure enough, you will get a close shave, but if all of your facial hair does not grow at a perfect 90 degree angle to your face, you will NEVER get a complete shave.  I bought this thing hoping to save time in the morning shaving and cleaning the razor.  In the past (and now present) I&#x27;ve always used the Norelco ROTARY electric shaver.  Having curly hair, the rotary razor does a decent job, no more than three strokes to shave ALL the hair in any given area.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Braun \\&quot;360 Complete\\&quot; is pure marketing hype.  It takes 3 x&#x27;s longer, leaving my face sore and hot, and I would still have to touch up many visible hairs with my old Norelco!  The auto cleaner is not smart.  Cleaning cycle based on battery wear, not the condition of the razor. If you have curly facial hair, buy anything else.</li>
    <li> Simply put this is a great shaver. Gives a very comfortable shave. The cleaning/recharge station is a nice place to keep the shaver. It keeps the shaver clean and charged. Really an improvement over my last shaver.</li>
    <li> This is by far the beat electric razor i&#x27;ve ever used. &lt;br /&gt;closest shave i&#x27;ve ever had</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been few months that I had used this shaver, so I guess the review would be useful and insightful. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pros: &lt;br /&gt;* Easy to clean. Just slot in and set the clean on and woo la la it&#x27;s cleaned. No mess. &lt;br /&gt;* Useful hair trimmer. &lt;br /&gt;* The head can be fixed at 90 degree. &lt;br /&gt;* Saves time compared to wet razor shaving. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;br /&gt;* Leaves out few hairs here and there (Not a complete shave.). &lt;br /&gt;* When used at specific place in the face for a longer time, makes the skin harder. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have ever used, electric or blade. The only fault I have found with the razor is the noise level it creates when it is cleaning itself. That being said, I clean it when I go to sleep, thereby eliminating that problem. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Beware of the warranty on Braun shavers. They say try them for 3 or 4 weeks. When you call to say that they don&#x27;t work for you. You are told there is a  30 day warranty. So no return option after 30 days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for over 6 months.  I still go \\&quot;Man, I&#x27;m glad I bought this razor\\&quot; everytime I shave.    The only real criticism I can offer is that it takes me a bit to get the whiskers under my chin.  The area is hard to get to with the razor and the hair grows different directions.  But that&#x27;s probably an issue with me, not the razor.    Love it.  Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Before I bought this I had one of the older models. After a number of years that finally broke and I wanted to try out a new razor, so I bought a Remington. It was one of the kind that featured three circular blades on the head. The Remington couldn&#x27;t handle &#x27;the workload&#x27;, so to speak. I don&#x27;t think it could cut paper, much less my facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I wound up buying this after, as I should have in the first place. The Remington put me through fifteen minutes of hair-pulling torment, but the 360 Complete had absolutely no problems with my tougher facial hair. All I needed was a single pass from this thing. I was done in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, go for THIS model. Do not bother shelling out extra money for a lousy LCD screen you will probably never look at. This is really the ideal razor for someone who has a lot of hair, or only shaves a few times a week.</li>
    <li> I have been using electric shavers for about 20 years now.  I want the best shave possible from an electric shaver, and my experience has led me to expect such performance from Braun.  This razor is NO disappointment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave it gave me on the first day was nothing short of incredible!  Although I didn&#x27;t get a feel for the \\&quot;closer shave in fewer strokes\\&quot; claimed, this razor did give the absolute CLOSEST shave of any electric razor I have EVER used in the last 20 years or so!  Furthermore, it delivered a very COMFORTABLE shave as well.  There was no burn.  My face felt very comfortable the first time I used it.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how well it does after the recommended 3 week \\&quot;groove in\\&quot; time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other important note:  As a physician, I have worried about hearing loss from electric razors for years.  In addition to the best shave I have ever obtained from an electric razor, this is also the QUIETEST electric I have ever used.  In fact it is so quiet that for the first time ever, I do not worry about the decibel level when it is up by my ear.  EXCELLENT job.  Bravo Braun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The automatic cleaning system is awesome!  WIVES TAKE NOTE!  No more beard stubble in the sinks!  If you haven&#x27;t been able to train your man to rinse the sink out, this shaver deserves consideration on this count alone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor looked very nice coming out of the box.  Its shape gives a good feel in the hand.  My ONLY criticism for this razor is that the plastic in its construction feels a bit flimsy.  When paying in excess of $100 for a razor, I expect to feel a solidness similar to that felt when closing the door on a Mercedes.  Unfortunately, the \\&quot;feel\\&quot; of the plastic body of this razor has all the solidity of closing the door on a 1987 Dodge Colt.  I worry that the razor may crack the first time I drop it.  HOWEVER, because of its performance I MUST rate this shaver very high in spite of the lack of solidness in the \\&quot;fit and finish.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave this razor gave truly deserves its very high marks.  I have high standards in electric shavers, having used Braun for years now.  This razor still managed to \\&quot;wow\\&quot; me with its performance.s very high marks.  I have high standards in electric shavers, having used Braun for years now.  This razor still managed to \\&quot;wow\\&quot; me with its performance.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this shaver from amazon and its the best shaver I ever had. I have been using electronic shaver for last 6 years and in between i have used many shaver but this one is just great shaver to use. Its very easy and handy to shave.</li>
    <li> This razor works great and shaves like a champion. I&#x27;ve had it for about a week as of writing this review and it cuts closer than any razor I&#x27;ve had in the past. It handles very well, never pulls, and lives up to my expectations. I only have two complaints with it.    1. The razor \\&quot;feels\\&quot; good and expensive like it should, but the base looks and feels cheap, almost like it belongs with some other product. While this is a minor issue, I paid about $140 for this thing, and the package together doesn&#x27;t have that feeling.    Overall the purchase was worthwhile and I&#x27;m glad I shelled out the extra money for it.  2. The razor is pretty loud while operating, especially when you have the trimmer in use as well. While it cuts very, very well, this product is far louder than any razor I&#x27;ve used before. The cleaning base is reasonable in terms of sound and is fine if you shut the bathroom door.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000Q6SU3C Braun Pulsonic System 9595 with LCD Screen]]    I used and wore out 5 or 6 Norelco razors in the last 60 years and I never was very impressed with them.  I didn&#x27;t switch to another brand because when I shopped for a new razor they all seemed to offer about the same features and technology. I hate shaving but still an electric beats a safety razor any day.  At long last I visited the Amazon website and decided I would give the Braun a hard look.  Read the reviews and descriptions and felt it was enough info to give one a try.    After using the new Braun for 3+ weeks this is what I find:  I would certainly not use the word \\&quot;amazing\\&quot; to describe it, for sure.  I have a fairly light beard and like the Norelco, the Braun doesn&#x27;t shave my throat area unless I go over it repeatedly.  Further, I find I need to  go over ALL areas of my face a number of times but also it is necessary to change directions of each stroke. Perhaps I need to try a cirular motion for its effect.    The beard trimmer is located awkwardly, when it pops up it is behind the main body of the razor and out of sight...can&#x27;t see where I&#x27;m trimming. Maybe a man can go by sound or stop when he feels he is cutting flesh.    The self-cleaning feature is nice but a bit noisy,  I will conclude by saying I feel more time is neccesary to fully appreciate the Braun.  Lastly, as with any electric razor, pre-shave helps a great deal.  Charlie Bickel of CO</li>
    <li> Of all the electric razors I&#x27;ve used over the last sixty years, this one  works the best, and surprisingly was not the most expensive.</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with this shaver, I chose this over the new Pulsonic one as I think they will both do the same and you end up paying much less for this one. Close shave and fast,,, I had the old bruan model which was ok, but this new foil really works and I am very happy about the purchase. Also Battery will last you at least 10+ shaves without recharching..    I recommend this product to prospective buyers</li>
    <li> This shaver is amazing. Well worth the money. I had a norelco triple head shaver for three years and my face never got used to it and I never got a clean shave. I bought the braun 360 complete and was amazed at the great shave from day one. It&#x27;s the closest thing to a razor and doesn&#x27;t   tear up your face. I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this for \\&quot;medical reasons\\&quot;---i.e. I went on coumadin and was no longer allowed to use a blade to shave.  Otherwise I would never have considered an electric shaver---bad experiences with them decades ago.  Surprise: technology has improved the electric shaver.  This is probably the BEST example of outstanding design and techology I own.  You get a close shave (not quite like a blade, but then you aren&#x27;t scraping the top layer of skin cells off either!!).  You also get a comfortable shave.  I don&#x27;t get as close as I&#x27;d like in a couple of areas, but the smoothness, comfort and speed of the shave make up for that.  The cleaning system is also engineered excellently---people complain about the cost (it does cost, but so do blades and shaving \\&quot;cream\\&quot;---they don&#x27;t cost quite as much, but that&#x27;s the way it is).  However, some of the people who complain also say they like  the way the clean shaver feels.  I think it is a positive to have the cleaning system.  I&#x27;ve also used the shaver on the road for several weeks at a time; then I follow the Braun directions for cleaning the head with a brush.  I could take an aerosol can of lubricant (made by another manufacturer) but I&#x27;ve never done that.  The Braun keeps on delivering.  The multi-voltage cord is another outstanding touch (like my Mac laptop) in that you can go anywhere in the world and plug it in and it will work to power and charge the shaver.    Of course, one person&#x27;s feast is another person&#x27;s disappointing meal, so this shaver may not be for you.  But for me it is a technological triumph and a design success---as well as providing a first-class shaving experience.  And note that you can \\&quot;subscribe\\&quot; for the cartridges for the cleaning mechanism from Amazon---reasonably priced, with no shipping charges if you have a continuing order.</li>
    <li> When my old $30 Remington DA-307 shaver died (after several years of loyal operation with never having its blades or foil replaced), I decided it was time for something a bit higher quality.  I went with the new 8985 by Braun, and have been using it for about a month now.  It delivers an excellent shave, very close, with surprisingly few passes.  The cleaning system is entertaining, but probably not worth the money IMHO (this goes for all self-cleaning shaving systems however).  My first shave left black streaks on my face though, I guess it was the oil it shipped with on it still, that was gone after running it thorugh the cleaning solution the first time.  It&#x27;s a quiet shaver, and the cleaning process, although lengthy even on the shortest econo mode, is quiet and very effective.  I usually take the foil off after every shave, and empty the stubble to ensure the cleaning fluid lasts as long as it can, however after the cleaning cycle, I&#x27;ve taken the head off and never found stubble left behind, or anything except perfectly clean blades that even smell fresh. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only reason why this didn&#x27;t get 5 stars, is that $150 is a lot of money to spend on a shaver I think.  While I was waiting on this one, I bought a $10 (Titanium Turbo T2) shaver at Fry&#x27;s.  Although it couldn&#x27;t get a very close cut, couldn&#x27;t handle my goatee at all, and couldn&#x27;t even cut longer hairs just on my cheeks, it did get most of the job done.  And my $30 Remington?  It did everything I need, in fact, because its beard trimmer extended at a 90-degree angle and this Braun trimmer extends straight out, it was actually easier to follow the curve of my chin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In all, I am quite pleased with my purchase, it charges -very- rapidly (something the Remington didn&#x27;t do, and it couldn&#x27;t even run with a depleted battery while plugged into A/C).  It also performs well, with a clean and close shave, and absolutely no irritation.  The flashing LEDs are fun too, it feels like a well built bit of machinery that should last a very long time if taken care of.  Although I&#x27;m not sure I can say the same about the charging/cleaning station, it&#x27;s all plastic and seems as though it might be more needy, and end up cracked at some point.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco(s) for 35+ years, and I was quite satisfied with the shave(s) I received.  &lt;br /&gt;However, recently, I noted that my latest triple header wasn&#x27;t really doing the job, .i.e., it was taking me an exorbitant amount of time and the results were less than totally satisfactory.  &lt;br /&gt;After some procrastination and after reading several reviews on the internet, I elected to purchase a Braun 8985.  &lt;br /&gt;I purchased it at a warehouse type - membership required - store for $18 less than the lowest price which I could find on the internet. Furthermore, it came with a bonus AA battery powered travel razor.  &lt;br /&gt;I must say that the manual was absolutely atrocious!!!  &lt;br /&gt;After reading the enclosed instructions several times, I was totally confused. Several of the instructions were misprints - according to Braun.  &lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, after using the 8985, I find that I am able to shave in 1/2 the time which was required with a Norelco. Furthermore, the Braun does a far superior job shaving my neck as well as under my nose.  &lt;br /&gt;My only negative comment is the extremely awkward plug on the \\&quot;Special Cord Set.\\&quot; It protrudes 3 inches out from the electrical outlet. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I now understand why they call it the \\&quot;360 complete\\&quot;. This machine does what it is supposed to do well and then some. It will shave you close but also confortably and it will, on top of that, do it quickly. It will then, clean and charge itself! It&#x27;s like using a new shaver every time. That&#x27;s what I call complete. &lt;br /&gt;After 2 month of use, one day during the cleaning cycle, the pump on the cleaning base would not stop running (like it was stuck \\&quot;on\\&quot;). After unplugging  the unit for the rest of the day, it apparently reset itself. This is concerning since overheating and flamable fluids don&#x27;t go very well together. I now make sure theat I am always present during the cleaning cycle. This does not diminish the performance or rating of this product.</li>
    <li> I upgraded (finally) from Amazon.com a few months ago from a Braun puchased over 10 years ago (that I had reconditioned, new batteries put in, etc), which in turn replaced a Braun. I&#x27;m clearly in the Braun camp. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The 8985 shaves heads and tails better than anything I&#x27;ve used. Quiet, close, non irritating. Well balanced and easy to hold/maneuver as well. I was originally concerned about having to be on the hook to ongoingly purchase cleaning solution. To extend the solution, I quickly (5 seconds) brush out the hair prior to running the shaver through its cleaning cycle. The solution has lasted far longer than I&#x27;d have thought. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Admittedly, it&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve shaved with Norelcos or Remingtons or other shavers, but I am extremely pleased with the 8985. Certainly if you&#x27;ve liked Brauns and it&#x27;s been a while since you&#x27;ve upgraded, it might be worth a look to try this model on.</li>
    <li> I will start off and let you know that I am folicly challenged. So I go for the shaved head look. I was looking for a quicker solution to the head shaving process. I had been using the Norelco Accuvac but it still required the use of a razor to get to skin. So I did some research and found the Braun 360. It does a great job in half the time. I get a ultra close and smooth shave everytime. My girlfriend can&#x27;t tell whether i used Mach3 or Braun 360. It is still fairly new so I am a little skeptical on whether the cleaning system is making a difference. But at least it looks cool sitting on the counter in bathroom.</li>
    <li> I had another brand of electric shaver before purchasing the Braun 8985 360.  I read about the Braun in Consumer Reports magazine where it was rated ahead of the one I had.  I must say, it performs at another level compared to my old one, so much so that I almost don&#x27;t have to shave every day.  Amazon had the best price that I could find as well--I recommend it highly.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my son for Christmas, he loves it, have had no problems. He had lots of shaving irritation with blades, but was was concerned that he would not get as close a shave with this product, but just as good and done in fraction of the time. The price I paid was lowested I saw while shoping and still have not seen it at a lower price than what I paid at Amazon.  My older son has a similar version, but not the 360 complete which has more shaving flexibility.  The self cleaning feature is interesting, as it turns itself on and off as it cleans.  Hint--clean out the majority of the wiskers before you place it in the cleaner, then let the cleaning system finish up removing the small stuff.  Your cleaning solution will last longer.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for an older model and am very pleasd with the razor and it&#x27;s features.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver but it is not perfect. I would give it 5 stars but I don&#x27;t think there is a perfect electric shaver. This is as close as you can get though. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Sent it back. I got more razor burn with this than with a regular razor.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric razor so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.  I decided to buy the Braun shaver b/c I was tired of shaving every other day or every third day with my Mach 3 and still having irritation.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;PROS: &lt;br /&gt;(1)The shaver does a good job of removing daily stubble.    &lt;br /&gt;(2)Battery life is really good and the unit charges quickly. &lt;br /&gt;(3) Cleaning station leaves shaver feeling new, clean, and fresh. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;CONS:   &lt;br /&gt;(1) I find myself passing over the same area too many times leading to minor skin irritation.   &lt;br /&gt;(2) The trimmer feature is located at an awkward angle and seems like a design afterthought. (I don&#x27;t use it for this reason)  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: &lt;br /&gt;If this shaver were lost or stolen I would buy it again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN A BRAUN ELECTRIC SHAVER USER FOR MANY YEARS. I CHANGE THE HEAD AT LEAST ONCE A YEAR FOR MAXIMUM SHARPNESS.  I JUST BOUGHT THE BRAUN 8985 AND FOUND IT TO BE THE BEST ELECTRIC RAZOR I HAVE EVER USED.  IF IS FAST, SMOOTH &amp; GIVES ME AN UNBELIEVABLE SHAVE.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for two weeks now and have been very happy with the results. It replaced Norelco Speed XL, which started pulling hair and irritating the skin after few months of use. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This shaver definitely cuts closer that either Speed XL or previous Braun models (I used to have 5100). It also does a noticably better job in tricky spots around the neck. It is very smooth, I have not had any irritations from the start, perhaps in part because the docking station keeps it clean and lubricated. It is also very, very powerfull, it did a great job on Monday after a weekend of not shaving with seemingly no extra effort. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The downside of this power is the noise. This shaver is LOUD! Even with the bathroom door closed everyone im my house could hear it in the morning. So it&#x27;s been \\&quot;banished\\&quot; to the 1st floor bathroom. Keep this in mind if the rest of your household does not want to wake up with you. Still I have no regrets I got it, as its convenience beats shaving gel, razors and the associated mess.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best electric shaver I have ever used.  No strays, smooth and comfortable!!!</li>
    <li> Gives a great shave, and cleaning system is very convenient. It looks cool too. &lt;br /&gt;Slight negatives: (1) not the quietest way to shave your face; (2) cleaning mechanism creates a lot of noise--you&#x27;ll need to get used to it or avoid it by vacating the room or just hopping in the shower after shaving; (3) cleaning fluid will easily spill out of the base if you&#x27;re not careful with the base.</li>
    <li> This is easily the best razor I have ever owned.  Previously owned low end Braun and a Remingtion razor.  This razor shaves as close as my Remington but without the skin irritation. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Suprisingly my favorite feature is the cleaning station.  I clean mine about once a week and leave the base unplugged between cleanings.  The cleaning refill lasted between 3 &amp; 4 months.  When the razor comes out of the base clean it shaves just like new.</li>
    <li> Cuts poorly. I have to shave over the same spot 3 or more times and that irritates my skin. DOES NOT get the tough to reach spots at all and WILL NOT cut my neck hairs no matter how many times i shave at any angle. The cleaner is nice but loud and the shaver is extremely loud. Not worth the price at all. Total let down. &lt;br /&gt;Also, the shaver cleaner is way over priced. It&#x27;s just alcohol for gods sakes.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t yank hairs like my Norelco rotary with the \\&quot;pluck and cut\\&quot; system ;) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I can shave extremely quickly with this razor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Self cleaning is not a gimmick. It really maintains and cleans the razor well. Just remember, the cleaning duration is not set based on how dirty your razor actually is, but how long you have used it between cleanings...</li>
    <li> Switching from a 10 year old Panasonic electric razor to a state-of-the-art Braun shaver, gave me every expectation of a quicker and closer shave. Neither has happened, and I find the sideburn trimmer so badly placed that it is impossible to use for any purpose.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few different electric shaver&#x27;s in the past.  All the tripple rotating head types.  This was my first foil type.  My skin takes it so much better than any other razor i&#x27;ve ever owned and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  I shave more often because of it, and that&#x27;s a big deal.  Highly recommended if you&#x27;ve never been completely happy with other types of electric razors.</li>
    <li> I bought it because out of all that I read it seemed to be the highest rated electric shaver on the market.  It does a pretty decent job, it is the most comfortable electric shaver I&#x27;ve used but it doesn&#x27;t get as close as I had expected.  My old Panasonic produced a closer shave.  Plus in order to keep it clean you need to spend $25 every few months on the cleaning solution which is pretty gimmicky, my old panasonic got just as clean with soap and water.</li>
    <li> I have used a blade for 30+ years but had to switch due to some treatments I am having.  This product does exactly what it claims and provides an extremely close shave.  The cleaner works very well too.  I am extremely happy with the product so far as I have been using for about 6 weeks and have had no problems with it whatsoever.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews on this product I decide to buy one. This is the Rolls Royce of electric shavers. In order to appreciate what this shaver can do I suggest buying a cheap shaver before purchasing this one. I owned a cheap shaver for several months until it broke. I make 1-2 passes with the Braun versus the 7-8 with the cheap shaver. It really gets razor close without a razor. I purchased this one over the LCD version because I thought  the LCD was a little overkill.(Its a SHAVER!!)  [...]</li>
    <li> I must say this is the best shaving system I have ever used! I have used razors, rotary, and foil electric shavers, but non of them come close to this one. I have rough skin and suffer from acne, which to my surprise was extremely reduced once I started using the Braun 360. Unlike my previous foil electric shaver, you practically don&#x27;t feel the blades cutting your beard on this one. Also, I think the alcohol on the cleaning system helps with my acne since I use it after every shave. At first I was a hesitant about spending $130 on a shaver that I will have to spend more money on in the future for the cleaning system (especially that I have tried so many other lower-priced shavers), but I am confident that I will never use anything else after this one, and I only wish I have switched earlier...</li>
    <li> I would say this is a pretty good shaver.  The best of the 3 that we have had.  We have a special needs adult to shave, and it is always a challenge.  This one does not give a razor burn.  cuts pretty close, although could be a little better.  Hard to get under the nose, but this could be because our son is not able to help us out.  Overall not a bad razor.</li>
    <li> I am 26 years old and I have been shaving primarily with Braun since I started shaving. I had Braun (model 6520), which I got for my 18th birthday, and it lasted me almost 8 years. Throughout the 8 years, I changed foil only once. The old model gave me a shave whose closeness was competitive to manual razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I decided to get this new model. While it&#x27;s not perfect, it comes very close to it. It gives a closer shave than my older model, provides a softer feel while shaving and does it faster. It still leaves room for improvement, such as providing a better shave in the neck area, but its performance is still much improved over older models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say that I shaved with many good manual razors, like Mach III or others, the ones I did shave with, didn&#x27;t actually provide a better shave than this electric model. Of course the big plus with electric is that it  doesn&#x27;t cut my skin like razors do. Moreover, it&#x27;s faster and without any mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be noted that face should be dry prior to shaving, or else shave will not be nearly as close. All in all, it&#x27;s a great product in terms of performance, reliability and comfort.</li>
    <li> I have two shavers, an older Norelco 8160XL and a new Braun 8985. The Norelco provides a much closer shave and shaving time therefore shorter. The shaving head in the Braun is more flexible, which gives the Braun a slight edge on surfaces of your skin that are not even. However the Norelco is more sturdy and does not bend away when you try to shave an area. Thus on your cheeks and most of the neck the Norelco does a better job. I have to replace the Norelco&#x27;s blades about every 12 months. The Braun states that blades should be replaced every 18 month, so this seems to give the Braun a slight edge.   The cleaning station is nice, but has one big disadvantage. If you put the shaver in the cleaning station it gets hot. So if you have to shave an area again because the shaver did a lousy job and you did not realize that, then you have to do it with a hot shaver.   Overall I am less then happy with the product. The shaver comes with a 60 day return policy. So keep the package and you can return the product to Braun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this model Braun to replace a much older model and I think the money was well spent.  The shaver produces a close shave, is quiet and feels well constructed.  I&#x27;ve used Norelcos in the past and their rotary cutter design just does not have the fast coverage of the Braun design.  I&#x27;ve never tried the Panasonic brands, so I can&#x27;t comment on them. I&#x27;ve also looked at spending more on Braun&#x27;s top of the line Pulstronic brand, and it may produce a little closer shave, but for another $100, I doubt it would be that much better.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun razors for many years, each time upgrading to their newer and more expensive technology. After buying this razor, I will change brands and go with Panasonic for the future. The main reason is the HUGE and ridiculous &#x27;Clean and Renew&#x27; system that comes with these shavers. The razor does not make good contact while in the cradle so the only way to charge it is to plug the cord directly into the razor and not the base. Also because the razor does not make proper contact, the cleaning system will start and then abruptly shut off leaving a dirty, alcohol-wet razor. The whole idea of having to buy cleaning cartridges is crazy as well. Give me a good quality razor that I can clean by rinsing under a faucet and I will be happy. Goodbye Braun...</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver/clean &amp; renew charging base used off Ebay for $37.09 plus $10.00 shipping for a total of $47.09, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  My expectations, however, were far surpassed once I took delivery of this fine piece of German engineering.  It was in perfect, near-new condition, and after an overnight charge, it lept into action and aggressively attacked my two-day growth of facial hair.      I had used the Gillette Sensor twin blade system for the last 15 years.  I shaved with it in the shower using shaving oil.  Irrefutably, this produced a good, clean, and close shave, but it also scraped away a microscopic layer of skin each day.  Now that I have celebrated my 52nd birthday, my skin seems thinner and more prone to trauma, and blade shaving began to take its toll.  In addition, the oil that I used with the blade began to make a mess that I had to clean from my shower stall, and I knew that I was spending more time in the shower--wasting hot water--than I would if I could find a good electric, dry shaving alternative.    I began a several-month quest to gather research in hopes of bypassing all the substandard models of shavers out there.  The Braun Pulsonic was top-rated, but I seriously couldn&#x27;t see paying some $200 for this product.  I also found that the Remington MicroScreen 500 MS2-390 was highly-rated, but I liked the idea of Braun&#x27;s clean and renew system.  A July 2008 Consumer Reports article that rated Braun&#x27;s 8985 model its #1 choice put me over the top, and I decided that the 8985 would also be my choice.  I was patient in my quest to find the best possible deal, and then a couple weeks ago, BAM!  I submitted the winning $47.09 bid for an 8985 Braun shaver on Ebay.     I&#x27;ve shaved with this unit for a full week now, and I must report that, \\&quot;No, it does not shave as close as a blade.\\&quot;  I doubt that this holy grail of shaving will ever be achieved with an electric shaver, at least in my lifetime.  However, it does shave surprisingly close,and it does the job quickly.  Indeed it takes me no longer to shave with the electric that it used to with the blade.  In addition, I will now save hundreds of gallons of hot water (and a lot of money) each year by shaving in front of a mirror instead of in the shower.  Indeed, I&#x27;d say that my showers are now approximately 33% shorter in durration.      Of course, I did have to learn to contort my face, hold and stretch my skin with my off-hand, and run the razor in just the right direction against the grain of hair growth on all parts of my beard.  After a week of this, though, I now have it down-pat, and I have to say that the shave I get is \\&quot;good enough.\\&quot;  I understand that a shavee must allow up to a couple months of acclimation in order to receive the closest possible shave, so I anticipate that the closeness of my shave will only get better from here.    The Clean &amp; Renew system works well too.  After reading several posts, though, I&#x27;ve decided to only use it on a weekly basis, and in hindsight, I doubt that anyone would have to use it more often than that.  I do remove the screen every other day and gently tap out the clippings.      Also, I plan to look into making my own formula to refill the clean and renew cartridges (the ingredients appear to consist mostly of SD Alcohol 40-B which, I found, is made nondrinkable not by making it poisonous, but by making it extremely bitter).  Thus, this type of alcohol can be exposed to the skin without any risk of being poisoned via absorption through the skin.    Sorry, I got off the main topic.  I must leave you with \\&quot;Two Thumbs Up\\&quot; for the fine Braun 8985 Shaver.  It just feels substantial and durable, and when I am shaving, it doesn&#x27;t even bog down the motor.  This is worlds ahead of the last electric shaver I used back in the mid-80s (a Panasonic).  I know I&#x27;ll be enjoying the 8985 for a long time to come.</li>
    <li> Neckline and above the shaver does a good job.  Terrible shave for below the chin/neckline.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for close to 8 years.  It still is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It gives me as close a shave as my manual razor, with the sole qualification that on occasion it misses a hair or two (which may well say more about me than it).  This is a small inconvenience when compared to the bloodbaths I&#x27;ve known when shaving with a manual razor on little sleep...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newer models have more bells and whistles - but I see little indication of any real improvement.</li>
    <li> It just doesn&#x27;t shave like a blade. Have to go over areas two or three times. It could use improvement.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the item. Works better than the my previous Braun 7526 which is still working by the way....</li>
    <li> tried a few other after my old braun died but theirs not any that are close to the quality of braun shavers.</li>
    <li> great razor would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Best Shaver ever! had it for over 5 years now.</li>
    <li> I really do like this shaver. The cleaning system ensures a fresh razor each time it is used. I do notice however, that the closeness and the number of times I have to run the shaver across my face to get a smooth surface is more than I would like. All in all, I would recommend this system.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s admit it, shaving is a very subjective topic.  As electric shavers go, the Braun 360 Complete is pretty good--it&#x27;s quiet, quick, maneuverable, shaves relatively cose (sometimes takes several go-overs), and self-cleaning (very cool).  It&#x27;s also expensive, but all electric razors are expensive when compared to old-fashioned hand-helds (and no electric razor has ever been able to give me as close a shave as a hand razor). It also irritates the skin of my upper neckline where I find it very difficult to get a close shave.  Now I&#x27;ll admit to having thick, fasting-growing, black-colored stubble, so it mught just be that electric razor technology is not yet up to my challenging standards!</li>
    <li> I have and old Norelco rotary blades razor, used for almost four years and I just got this Braun as a father&#x27;s day present (what else can you give dad, right?). Anyway, I was looking to replace my Norelco as I think technology on electric razors keeps evolving, and also after four years the machine is not the same, even if you replace the blades. I had stayed away from this razor because of its price (almost double what I paid for my old Norelco), but it was on my wish list and as so I got it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shaved with my old Norelco on Friday, didn&#x27;t shave during the weekend as usual and today I shaved with this marvel. AMAZING is just the word. I perfectly shaved a two days grown beard in about 6 minutes, no pain, no hassle, just a breeze. I was greatly surprised that the beard was disappearing effortless and without causing irritation. Even if Braun claims that you will need two to three weeks to get a good shave if you&#x27;ve used a rotary blade razor before, the results I got today are far better than the ones I got with my old Norelco at its peak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too early to test the auto-cleaning results or how long the cleaning cartridge will last or for how long it will remain charged or its durability, but the way I shaved today was the best I&#x27;ve done with any electric razor, and I have to give five stars to a result like that. And the best part is I didn&#x27;t pay for it! (Or did I? not sure yet)</li>
    <li> This is the first electric I have used. I like the way feels and it does a fair job of shaving though from what I read I have to give it a month to be really efficient, which I think means that my whiskers have to reorint their gorwth direction to comply with the shaving blade.  So the final opinion is out.</li>
    <li> This is a great electric razor.  I&#x27;ve never had a shaver that gave me such a clean, close shave before.  The automatic cleaner is cool.</li>
    <li> According to my boyfriend, it is the best razor ever.  He can shave every day without getting razor burn on his neck.</li>
    <li> Product arrive in time for Christmas. My son loves it &amp; said it is the best shave he has ever had.</li>
    <li> Because of a shipment delay, it did not make it in time for Christmas. This item was ordered on 12/10/06.</li>
    <li> I had this razor for a year and a half, it worked well for a while but then I had a hard time shaving my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a year it started leaking battery acid everywhere and I had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> What the picture doesn&#x27;t show very clearly is just how large the cleaning base for this shaver is.  It&#x27;s pretty monstrous, larger than a standard box of kleenex, and it&#x27;s supposed to be kept on the counter, nice and level, and plugged in.  But the plug is a poor shape - it sticks out about three inches horizontally from the socket instead of hugging the wall.  The cleaning solution will spill if you tilt the base, and the instructions describe how the alcohol solution will slowly evaporate into the air, so it&#x27;s probably not safe to keep under the counter either.  (Also, this prevents you from trying to stretch out the cleaning solution by cleaning only every few days.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have no idea how well this shaver works, since it was so loud when I turned it on, that I decided to return it.  Much much louder than my old Norelco rotary shaver.  Wake-your-girlfriend loud, even behind a closed door. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This contraption convinced me that it was a lot less trouble to just go back to shaving the normal, manly way.</li>
    <li> I just got this shaver-- I found that Remington sells the cleaning solution for an electric razor.  it is an 8 oz. bottle and sells for 5.00 at wal-mart-- bet it is the same stuf that braun sells.  Anyway I got a bottle.  it smells just like the braun-- nice lemon smell.  the only problem with the braun is the expensive shaver cleaner.</li>
    <li> I dont want to claim it will work for you, but it worked for me when it comes to ingrown hairs.  I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of blade razors and even the triple rotating electrics with no luck.  Now, I use this razor in combination with Tend Skin (anti-ingrown hair solution) and have noticed a remarkable difference.    DOWNSIDES:  It DOES take the full 3 weeks to allow your skin/hair to adjust.  During these three weeks, the ingrown hair problem even seemed to get worse.  Be patient!!  Plan adjusting with this razor with a long vacation or definitely not as part of a wedding, or some important event.    I would suggest getting it at a retail store rather than Amazon, so you can return it even after the 3 weeks you don&#x27;t notice a difference.    Even after the 3 weeks, you still may have those stubborn areas with curly hair.  You will need to have a blunt needle to gently tease these curly hairs out so that the can be cut by the razor.  GENTLY TEASE the hairs out from being burried in the skin...not a mining expedition (like you have to do when using a blade razor).    The power-comb is just a gimmick...don&#x27;t expect it to do what it says.  It didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  There is another way to solve the problem of hairs that lay flat agains the skin. I just use the side burn trimmer to shorten then and then the regular shaving head to shave them.    The self cleaner is very noisy (louder than shaving).  The base stand also will leak the cleaner solution even if it is tipped slightly (meaning you can&#x27;t pack it in luggage, it MUST stay in its usual location).  Even with these downfalls, its VERY nice to have a clean razor every shave...probably better on the skin too (less germs).    Even with the downsides, I still rate this a 5!</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun shavers for 20 years or so. I like them better than any other electrics I have tried. This one does an adequate job of shaving. As with all other razors, it takes me a while to get used to it, so the first couple weeks it makes my face hurt a lot. The cutting blade does not extend close enough to the outside edge of the foil, so it can be difficult to shave some spots. It is comfortable to hold. It seems to work well so far.   My big problem is the base. On my old 7000 series, the base allowed my to set it to clean or charge or both. This one just has a button to start the cleaning cycle but it charges every time. This presumably will shorten the life of the battery because you are charging it more often than you need to. Also, it has a sensor that shows the level of fluid left in the cartridge, something I just checked manually on the old shaver base. The problem is when this one senses the level is too low, it will not continue to do a cleaning cycle until it gets a new cartridge. At the point where it forces you to change cartridges, there is still about 2 weeks worth of fluid left. Consequently, over the life of this shaver (and my last one lasted 5+ years) this one feature will cost you hundreds in extra refills. Not to mention all the wasted chemicals and plastic from those extra refills. Sure, Braun makes a lot more money off you. Good for them in the short term. Bad for them in long term customer satisfaction. If they don&#x27;t address this, I will probably start looking for another brand.</li>
    <li> Pros - Great cut, but not like a razor (but no bleeding)    Cons - If you have any kind of beard, you will still need a trimer    Like most people say, give it time (about a month) to adjust to your face or for your face to adjust to the shaver. I would buy the shaver again. The 8985 is worth the money, don&#x27;t buy the LCD one, unless you have extra money.</li>
    <li> Was a loyal Norelco user until Consumer Reports strongly touted this product.  Got it and love it.  Great shave and great convenience.  The cleaning solution will cost $60/year and that may be a consideration to some.  It&#x27;s a financial sacrifice but no worry shaving and charging and cleaning make it worth the expense.</li>
    <li> The braun 8985 shaver  performs consistent with the information provided on the Amazon web site. From day one it  provided an excellent shave.  In my case I  transitioned from  a Gillette Mach 3 blade razor and after day one the results were very satisfactory.  I have found it necessary to clean the electric contacts on shaver and the cleaner/charger contacts once in two weeks  of operation. A pencil eraser works well. The last time I used  an electric shaver was back in the 1950s. The Braun is a big improvement over my last experience.</li>
    <li> After complaining for months that I needed to replace my old Norelco electric shaver, my wife bought me the Braun 8985 as a Father&#x27;s Day gift.  Talk about a big improvement - I find that where the Norelco always irritated the skin on my neck, the Braun is much more gentle.  I can press down very firmly and still not get the red irritated spots that I used to get before.  The razor feels very comfortable in my hand, and although the cleaning stand is somewhat bulky, I really like being able to just drop the shaver in and have it clean the next time I come back.  I would definitely recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I Used the Braun Activator series very intensively ( the 8585 ) for almost a Year and a Half. The Jump to the  360 was out of necessity since the Razor head  had stopped working evenly.  The 360 Charged up quickly, and gave a quick and smooth shave. As much as I thought of the Activator and how it was Good, the 360 was just a leap forward. It had a different and better head for shaving, and it was quieter. I could actually listen to the radio in the morning and shave quietly. The 360 has the best technology, it even has a warning light for when the Blade and foil needs to be changed. This is a must have for any Braun shaver user. Its a great boon to me especially with my thick beard, and sensitive skin, something the 360 takes good care of as it did with the activator.The difference in the blade is visible( the 360 blade looks better), and when used , the difference is tangible.Even the cleaner( shaped the same as the 8585 ) has a better stepped cleaning range so the process works better.</li>
    <li> I have to come clean, I have had Braun shavers for most of my life but recently had switched to a remington (due to my local store being out of all brauns) after mine had died.  I shelled out over $70 for a Remington and would never again stray.  This braun is great, very close shave and no nicks.  Not sure what the other guy is talking about on the nicks!  The cleaning process, I was a bit skeptical about, but it is worth it in the end.  I have a thick beard and for the money and not having to clean it myself, it is well worth it.  Also, I used to get acne coming back every once in awhile but with this cleaning system, it seems almost non-existent.  I am guessing that having a sterile and clean blade probably helps my face, go figure!  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband&#x27;s birthday. He had decided to go bald and was shaving with a regular razor and hated it. Once he had his electric braun it&#x27;s done in a snap and easy to clean. It is definitely a great choice.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand any of the positive reviews for the 8985 and I question their authenticity based on my experiences. I have used electric shavers and Braun in particular for decades and have been pleased with their performance.    My complaints with the 8985 are just about everything that matters in a shave:  - the refill cleaning cartridges are expensive  - if you travel you can&#x27;t get the benefit the cleaning mechanism/process as the fluid spills out of the unit easily and can barely be picked-up in the bathroom without a spill and certainly cannot be packed into luggage  - as the directions state, the alcohol in the cleaning solution evaporates into the air when the unit is sitting idle...I think there were just some studies released about the dangers of fumes from household rubbing alcohol and health....not that anyone needs more indoor pollutants  - the cleaning cycle process is noisy so expect it to immediately engage its cleaning cycle when you place it back in its holder and the noise can wake those sleeping in near by bedrooms  - because the cleaning cycle starts immediately, you cannot easily grab and use the razor for any whiskers you realize have been missed or that need to be touched-up  - the base unit that charges and cleans the shaver is huge and the directions say not to store it inside certain medicine cabinets because of a build-up of fumes due to the evaporating rubbing alcohol  - I have used the triangular head electric shavers previously and find the straight shaver head style is no good for shaving any but the most straightforward of facial hair....neck, dimple, near the nose...forget it  - the shaver has a lot of lights, which when I bought it I thought would be kind of techno and cool; in actuality I find the lights confusing and unnecessary  - one of my biggest complaints is that if you travel with the unit or don&#x27;t place it in its cleaning cradle for more than two days the shaver is unable to hold in the bits of hair it shaves....at best(I have learned this technique) the whiskers fall into the sink...at worst they sprinkle all over your shirt...very strange for a shaver of this cost  - I have found that my former Braun shaver, the one w/ the common triangular 3 head design, which must be 6+ years old and still on its original shaver head (the battery is shot and it must be plugged in) out shaves the 360 by a wide margin.    Again, I don&#x27;t understand anyone&#x27;s attraction to this shaver, I really believe it is a total waste of money and delivers a gimmicky inferior shave.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 5-7 months now and I would say it works as well or better than standard razors with disposable blades.  It gives a very close shave with far less irritation.  The cleaning cartridges do need to be replaced every month or two depending on whether or not you shave every day.  It does take a month or two to adjust to the razor, as state in the instruction manual.  I have found that it works best to shave every other day, but I would not recommend going more than three days between shaves as it will make it harder for the foil to lift and cut.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001VEK1IU Braun Series 5 Combi 51s Foil And Cutter Replacement Pack (Formerly 8000 360 Complete Or Activator)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite Christmas gift from last year. It feels hefty and well made to the touch. Keep in mind that this will handle most regular stubble, but isn&#x27;t great from anything about 5-6 mm.  There is an alternate trimmer that will handle most difficult areas but you need to have a mirror to make sure you&#x27;re getting everything. It will not pick up hairs that are lying flat to the skin.  It&#x27;s still very impressive overall and definitely warrants a 5 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance wise it has hardly any tugging or pulling except when you snag that occasional outlier you didn&#x27;t intend to trim. Doesn&#x27;t give a very tight shave but handles your daily clean up very efficiently and is way more convenient than a blade.It&#x27;s supposed to  be a wet/dry?? I have minor phobia of using electrical items in the shower, not matter what&#x27;s promised so I can&#x27;t comment on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clean sensor seems to be based more on time than actual debris? It seems to go down a clean level every time it&#x27;s used, regardless of how heavy the use is.  The replace cartridge sensor also seems to be based on the solution level which evaporates pretty quickly. Three weeks and it&#x27;ll tell you it need a change no matter how many times you&#x27;ve actually activated the wash.  The cartridges don&#x27;t run cheap either. probably $6-7 per change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery holds a charge fantastically. 2 weeks of travel and it wasn&#x27;t even half drained. This is definitely a great daily use shaver that&#x27;s convenient and does its job very well.  Not cheap but it feels like it&#x27;ll last more than a handful of years.</li>
    <li> This shaver has been in use for a couple of years.  I have had several other electric shavers and this is Only Fair in performance.  All of the others were Good or Very Good.  It just doesn&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
    <li> I bought this Braun 8985 shaver back in 2011 as a backup to my Braun 8980 that I bought back in 2007.  I bought it as a backup because I love the build, the shave, and the quality.  Guess what, I&#x27;m a daily shaver and both of my Brauns are still running strong.  The only problem is the new style cutter blocks are a pain to use.  Luckily, I am a bit of a hoarder when it comes to things I really like.  I should have enough of the old stock to last me another 20 years.  Based on the strong performance that I&#x27;m still getting out of these 2 shavers, I am confident that these shavers will last until then.  Hopefully, in 20 years, someone will produce another shaver with the same quality and comfort as these Brauns.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving my head and face for the last 15 years and this is the best electric shaver I have found. Works great and is heavy duty enough to work great everyday.</li>
    <li> Best Electric Razor I have ever purchased.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon ROCKS !&lt;br /&gt;Not had one problem with it since I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;Only setback is that it loves the cleaning fluid !</li>
    <li> 6 years!  way to go Braun!  I&#x27;m going to buy another one.  The 2 year warranty came in handy since the base had problems after 14 months.  I have replaced the cutters and foil a few times. The head assembly that holds the foil is disintegrating/delaminating at the short ends but that doesn&#x27;t affect the shave.  The battery on this thing lasts at least 14 days, I have never run out of juice while travelling.  The base unit seems to be the weak link, mine has stopped cleaning finally.  I paid $200 for this so $200/6yrs*1yr/365days&#x3D; $0.09/day plus a few blade replacements and alcohol (don&#x27;t buy the alcohol cartridges)</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver.  I highly recommend it.  It is a little bit noisy if you aren&#x27;t used to an electric.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver -- smoothest shaves I have had in years.  Worth every penny !!</li>
    <li> I get very close shave. I love the way it cleans itself after the shave. This replaced my panasonic wet/dry shaver that worked fine for almost 6 years. (still works) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Minus: Its a little big for me. Wet option would have been ideal though I may not use it often.</li>
    <li> This is a very high class product. It produces a shave of very near wet razor quality in very nearly the same time frame. I especially appreciate the self-cleaning feature and the information provided on the led&#x27;s. No problem with the time required to complete or the noises accompanying the cleaning cycle.</li>
    <li> I have had several Braun razors and the new model 8985 is the best.  The Model 8985 gives a closer shave and it does a better job in shaking the debris from the razor. I believe that the battery has improved and gives more shaves before it needs recharging. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I felt so good about this razor that I gave one to my brother.  He is now singing the praise of the 8995.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Robert E. Huber</li>
    <li> I switched to blades about 5 years ago when I started shaving my entire head. Then, I got lazy about shaving every day, so I got this shaver so that I would not kill too much time shaving every day. It&#x27;s great. It shaves my roughened stubble quite  well.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only caveat is this. READ THE MANUAL! Like most modern gizmos, this shaver has a few too many features, but all in all, it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver that I&#x27;ve used.  It is extremely convenient and easy.  I had a rotary shaver in the past, but never got the close shave I&#x27;ve wanted.  This one does the trick.  Plus, it even cleans itself, what more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for several weeks now and have taken it along on several business trips. I can say that it is built really well and feels comfortable in your hand. The shave is as close as can be expected with an electric razor. I like the cleaning base unit and the shaver has a nice clean scented smell after the cleaning cycle. The cleaning cycle is kind of noisy with the razor turning on and off several times during the cycle. It lasts for about 5 minutes. It comes with a travel case and the battery can last for more than a full week of shaving. ( That is as long as I have gone without charging) Overall a good razor.</li>
    <li> It was what I thought it was. Took about a week to fully transition from a blade to this shaver, but it works great. A bit of a hidden charge with the need for refills on the cleaning solution, but it&#x27;s worth it to save the time from cleaning it.</li>
    <li> Sure it has many pretty lights and a slick design. One problem though: it is terrible at SHAVING! I was using my old Braun 6520, and was quite happy with it. Then I saw a good deal for this \\&quot;new, redesigned, superb, self-cleaning\\&quot; shaver and decided to upgrade. Bad idea! After shaving with it, it looks like I have a day-old stubble. No matter how much I twist and press it, the \\&quot;new super system of blades designed by no one other than Gillette\\&quot; does a bad job.  This morning I actually pulled my old 6520 out, shaved off as much as I could with this \\&quot;360 Complete\\&quot; garbage, and then used 6520 to see how much \\&quot;clean up\\&quot; it would do. The difference was both very visible and substantial! I am really sorry I bought this and feel duped by their marketing... Don&#x27;t make the same mistake as me. Buy something else and save your money.</li>
    <li> I upgraded my Braun 8985 electric shaver to the NEW Braun 8985.  I was hoping it would be an improved shaver. The NEW Braun 8985 electric shaver is everything the company says and more.  It shaves closer, better and faster.  There is NO IRRITTATION !!!!!!!!!  I am 100% satisfied with it. If you are looking for a smooth electric shaver, buy this one. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with this shaver.  It is well made and engineered.  I did have a \\&quot;break-in\\&quot; period when I started to use it--you may notice some pulling before your beard acclimates.  It cuts as well as other electric shavers.  I had a 5700 model before this.  On that one, the shaver lasted about 4 years before the battery went bad, replaced the heads twice and the trimmer broke but was also using a blade sometimes.  Time will tell if I paid too much although I got a very good price at Amazon after window shopping/comparing on the web.</li>
    <li> I had a similiar Braun for about 5 years prior to this purchase and it worked well.    This one worked fine for about the first 2 weeks.    After that, it would not charge or clean.    I sent it in for repairs and the part that it needs has been on back order for about a month.    They could not give any info as to when the part might be available.    I hate paying 140+ for a razor I cannot use and in addition, paying shipping to have it repaired.    Other than that, it was an excellent purchase.</li>
    <li> Simply it does what it is advertised to do. I dropped Norelco for Braun, and I am very pleased with the results and look forward to shaving more often.</li>
    <li> I have now used this razor for 2 weeks.  Still battling razor burn, but a great shave.  Better than the rotary I was using. Almost as good as a blade. I like the cleaning system too.  I really need more experience to give an accurate review.</li>
    <li> I started shaving with a Remington foil razor years ago.  I then switched to a rotary by Noreco almost soley because it squirted lotion out, and after that broke I started using a Gillete Mach 3 blade razor.  I&#x27;ve found the Braun 360 to be better than the rotary but not quite as close as the blade.  However, the ease of use of the Braun vs a blade more than makes up for it.  The cleaning process is a bit loud, but only for a few minutes.  I do not clean it after every use, but every 2-3 uses.  I&#x27;ve had the unit for about a month, and have plenty of cleaning fluid left.</li>
    <li> WOW. WAS I SURPRISED. I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD GET SUCH A CLOSE SHAVE WITH AN ELECTRIC SHAVER. THE REAL TEST TO ME WAS THE FACT THAT MY FACE STILL FELT SMOOTH 4-5 HOURS LATER. I WAS NEVER ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT WITH MY NORELCO.</li>
    <li> My shave is very hard and grows is different directions and even Gillette blades had hard time for me. This is not only the best shaver...its actually among the best products I have ever tried. Do yourself a favor and but it if you wanna look clean!</li>
    <li> I hesitated paying the sticker price for the Consumer Reports top rated Braun 8985 360.  I have used electric razors for over 50 years including Remington, Norelco, Krups, Braun and some others.  The very inexpensive Braun I was currently using was not satisfactory because it seemed to take forever to get only a passable shave.      The Braun 8985 360 lists at about $170 and includes an automatic cleaning and recharging system that I was unconvinced I really needed, however, its performance was rated excellent and so it has proved to be.  I am able to get an excellent, close shave amazingly fast compared to my inexpensive model. In fact, the Braun 8985 outperforms any electric razor I have ever used.  The automatic cleaning and recharging system is recommended after each use, however, I use the system only once per week substituting hand cleaning the rest of the week and that has worked out fine.  Altogether superb shaver.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shaver I have ever owned/used. When I take it on vacation I don&#x27;t have to charge it. I can get 5-6 shaves out of it on one charge. It&#x27;s shaves close without being irritating. When I bought it I was concerned about having to buy the cleaner. It seemed like the electric shaver companies trying to get in on the steady income business of the disposable companies. It is, but it&#x27;s not cost prohibitive. The foil needed replacing and I was thinking of getting the new model but a good shave can be an elusive thing. I think I will stick with this one.</li>
    <li> I bought this compulsively after reading all those hypes.    Everyone is different, and this shaver does not work for me very well.    1. It&#x27;s not shaving as closely &amp; cleanly as regular razor shavers.  2. Sometimes this thing sucks up your hairs and pulls them off of your skin.  It really hurts when that happens.    Like I said, everyone&#x27;s experience will be different because everyone has different facial shape and differet hair.</li>
    <li> We ordered a shaver and received it missing a few parts.  The unit worked twice but the third time would not accept a charge.  We contacted the seller who has been very evasive about this transaction.  We since disputed the charge with AMEX and are waiting for their instructions.  We had asked for his address to ship it back and he refused.  This was a horrible transaction.</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for many years now. It is very effective even today....and  I have never changed the head and blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still prefer this over my more expensive and newer Philips rotary model I have. This Brawn does a much better job of cutting my thick hair on my neck.( I am a very thick haired person).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is possessed! Last several months....it will just randomly turn on....even when the slider switch thing is in the off position. It did this suddenly at 3am one night. Scared the crap out of one time when I was sitting on the toilet and it suddenly turned it self on. (lol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I guess it is due to age and heavy use...maybe the switch inside is all cake up or something. I have tried cleaning it best i can....but no effect. Either way, it won&#x27;t shut off most of the time..so I have to let it run the batt out and only use it with cord....annoying.</li>
    <li> I have used this man&#x27;s shaver for the last 10 years &amp; it works as good as it was from the first day I purchased it. Using the power cord to charge the shaver when travelling is a great help, rather than charging it from the main cleaning block. I strongly recommend this to anyone interested in using this Shaver, especially when travelling.An excellent buy. Lionel.</li>
    <li> This is a decent enough shaver, but doesn&#x27;t live up to the sales hype.  I got a fairly good deal on mine at CostCo, but it was still pretty expensive.  I figured at that price, and with the Braun name behind it, it would be worth it.  Lots of talk about close shaves, no tugging, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that it does tug and pull at the whiskers, and the shave is not all that close.  Perhaps compared to other electric shavers it is, but I find that I have to go over my beard again and again to get all the whiskers, and by the time I come close to getting them all, I am likely to create some minor abrasions.  Sometimes, entire patches seem to resist the shaver, despite my best efforts, leaving an uneven look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If a whisker happens to get missed by the shaver a couple times and grows too long, it will not be shaved in the future at all, and will continue to grow until you happen to notice that you&#x27;ve got a ridiculous looking \\&quot;old man whisker\\&quot; growing out of your neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement cartridges for the cleaning fluid are expensive too (although despite what Braun says, you CAN refill them with denatured alcohol for pennies).  The replacement foil and cutter block are also expensive, so the cost of ownership is outrageous as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clean and Renew station takes up a lot of counter space, and is not well built.  My stopped working, so I went online to look at a replacement, and read everyone&#x27;s review which said the same thing.  That it is fragile and impossible not to have it stop performing all its functions in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit appears to be more of a device for Braun to sell replacement parts and refills than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the shave is acceptable, but nothing more than that.  It is useful for if I want to multitask and shave while watching TV or sitting on the throne.  But honestly, if I had a mulligan, I would never buy this, and probably wouldn&#x27;t get an electric shaver at all.  The rising cost of quality razors drove me to consider this, but the cost of razors is nothing compared to the ownership cost of this shaver.  A traditional shave in the shower, using shaving cream and a quality razor, is quicker, more comfortable, and in the end, cheaper as well.quality razors drove me to consider this, but the cost of razors is nothing compared to the ownership cost of this shaver.

    <li> My 90 year old father was happy with this shaver. and that&#x27;s not an easy task.</li>
    <li> Nice razor, but..........&lt;br /&gt;#1  Cost of fluid packages is ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;#2  Fairly slow to clear all of beard.&lt;br /&gt;#3  Does NOT irritate my skin at all.</li>
