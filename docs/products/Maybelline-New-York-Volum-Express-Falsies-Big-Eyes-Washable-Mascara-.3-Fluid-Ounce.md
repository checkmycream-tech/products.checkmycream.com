      <li>I love this mascara!</li>
      <li>It works great, is easy to apply.</li>
      <li>, i could not apply it without it looking like I had eyeliner own</li>
      <li>Of course, that is pretty darn good -- however, I wish I could purchase the lower lash application separately!</li>
      <li>I LOVE this mascara</li>
      <li>Love this mascara....</li>
      <li>Love this will buy again</li>
      <li>and I have found it in Chanel&#x27;s Imitiable Mascara (love this stuff)</li>
      <li>Spend more $ to get a better brand.</li>
      <li>its kinda a gel formula so it holds and its easy to take off</li>
      <li>You&#x27;d think that this would be a great product, but the different brush shapes don&#x27;t make a difference, and the purple side dries up very quickly.</li>
      <li>but i dont know, i just didnt enjoy it.</li>
      <li>I find that if you have the patience and the steady hand, that if you are able to apply mascara lash by lash, you will get the MOST out of any mascara no matter the brand.  </li>
      <li>I will stick with the original Maybelline mascara that I have been using for years.</li>
      <li>I would have to clean the mascara gunk off each wand before I could use it.</li>

      <li>then top it off with this mascara, and I would get drop dead gorgeous looking lashes....</li>
      <li>The only thing i like about is the lower lash brush, that works better than the top.</li>
      <li>Honestly, don&#x27;t waste your money on this, i was so happy once it got it.</li>
      <li>, (not even applying my lash fibers because I&#x27;m in such a rush in the mornings) and I still get  a nice effect.</li>
      <li>The small brush is a great help.</li>

      <li>, however what i used to do was apply one coat of my Chanel Imitiable Mascara first</li>
      <li>i love the effect it has on my lashes highly recommended to anybody who wants bigger lashes.</li>
      <li>and I think it performs very well for a drug store brand.</li>
      <li>I really appreciate the thought  that went into this design.</li>
      <li>I am suprised that more people are not impressed by this masacara, but to each their own.</li>
      <li>reason that I gave it only four stars, is that I am thrilled with the lower lashes, but the upper lashes are only as good as other Maybelline mascaras.</li>
      <li>I have to clean these flecks from my eye areas several times a day.</li>
      <li>It makes my lashes look big and full.</li>

      <li>This mascara worked fine the first few times.</li>
      <li>I am sitting here typing with long, full, unclumped lashes from THIS mascara.</li>
      <li>Stick to Falsies or the new Chaotic (which isn&#x27;t Chaotic at all)</li>
      <li>With the Two Applicator Brushes&lt;br /&gt;Maybelline had a new, thinking out of the box,  inovation with this product.</li>
      <li>While the mascara and wand the upper lashes is fine -- goes on smoothly, makes them long, separates them fine -- the mascara and wand for the lower lashes is practically worthless.  </li>
      <li>i am absolutly obsessed with this product its so amazing and perf.</li>
      <li>Just really not worth it for something that is good but not great.</li>
      <li>The only thing I do like about this product is the lower lash brush which is useful otherwise...don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been thinking about a mascara like this for some time, and now it appears! Whenever I attempt to do my lower lashes with mascara, I usually end up having to remove the smudges under my eyes created by a too-big applicator. This product is excellent for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason that I gave it only four stars, is that I am thrilled with the lower lashes, but the upper lashes are only as good as other Maybelline mascaras. Of course, that is pretty darn good -- however, I wish I could purchase the lower lash application separately! Maybelline... are you listening??</li>
    <li> I like the two wands - one for upper lashes and one for lower lashes.</li>
    <li> terrible it botherd my eyes alot and when i cleaned it off it pulled out my eyelashes</li>
    <li> While the mascara and wand the upper lashes is fine -- goes on smoothly, makes them long, separates them fine -- the mascara and wand for the lower lashes is practically worthless.  I doesn&#x27;t do anything special and I&#x27;ve never felt like I needed a separate wand or type of mascara for lower lashes.  And so the problem is that half of the price and weight of this product is going toward this lower lash mascara which I will never use.  Just really not worth it for something that is good but not great.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! It makes my lashes look big and full. I like how this mascara has a brush for your upper lashes and then one for your lower lashes. I will definitely be buying this mascara again!</li>
    <li> Ok, once again, this particular product I DID NOT order from Amazon.  I ordered from my local CVS and I love, love, love it!!! I am suprised that more people are not impressed by this masacara, but to each their own. I will say this, I do NOT use it for the bottom lashes, I like a lot of people, do not have a lot of bottom lashes, and when i would apply it to the lower lashes, i could not apply it without it looking like I had eyeliner own and I did not want to look like i had eyeliner on. So my review is based on the upper lashes brush / mascara.  I am a mascara junkie. Like a lot of women, I am on the quest for the PERFECT mascara and I have found it in Chanel&#x27;s Imitiable Mascara (love this stuff), however what i used to do was apply one coat of my Chanel Imitiable Mascara first and then my lash fibers by DivaDerme Stimulash Lash Extender Lashes In A Bottle Fake Eyelashes And Adhesives&lt;br /&gt;and then top it off with this mascara, and I would get drop dead gorgeous looking lashes....people would think i had fake eyelashes, and they were amazed when I told and could show them that I did not (have fake eyelashes on).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, i&#x27;ve been out of my Chanel Imitable Mascara for a couple of months now, and I just been depending on this mascara ONLY, (not even applying my lash fibers because I&#x27;m in such a rush in the mornings) and I still get  a nice effect. I LOVE this mascara and I think it performs very well for a drug store brand. I am sitting here typing with long, full, unclumped lashes from THIS mascara. I think a lot has to do with application. I find that if you have the patience and the steady hand, that if you are able to apply mascara lash by lash, you will get the MOST out of any mascara no matter the brand.  Also, I have had my mascara for over 6mos. (yeah, I know), and I have yet to get any clumping that others are mentioning.  This is a great mascara, and I think you get more than what you pay for with this mascara even if YOU DON&#x27;T use the bottom brush for the bottom lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noteables:  Other mascaras, I would recommend would be of course&lt;br /&gt;1. Chanel Imitiable Mascara&lt;br /&gt;2. This one&lt;br /&gt;3. Loreal Double Extend Mascara or Loreal Voluminous False Fiber Lashes&lt;br /&gt;4.Rimmel (Big Eyes?) its in a big fat pink bottle. I don&#x27;t see it here, so I will look in my makeup box when I get home and update this entry.&lt;br /&gt;5. and though not a mascara, the lash fibers that I mentioned in my post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, DO NOT be afraid to experiment with mascara. I find that i get the most dramatic effect when I use two different mascaras that focus on two different things. What I mean by this, is if you want length AND volume, do not rely on ONE mascara to give you the look you want.  By ONE mascara that mainly focuses on providing length, and then buy ANOTHER mascara that focuses on providing VOLUME, and layer the two.  You would be suprise what look you will have!!!! You will have natural looking fabulous eyelashes without the \\&quot;caterpillar look\\&quot; that everyone who is wearing fake eyelashes have.brush for the bottom lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noteables:  Other mascaras, I would recommend would be of course&lt;br /&gt;1. Chanel Imitiable Mascara&lt;br /&gt;2. This one&lt;br /&gt;3. Loreal Double Extend Mascara or Loreal Voluminous False Fiber Lashes&lt;br /&gt;4.Rimmel (Big Eyes?) its in a big fat pink bottle. I don&#x27;t see it here, so I will look in my makeup box when I get home and update this entry.&lt;br /&gt;5. and though not a mascara, the lash fibers that I mentioned in my post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, DO NOT be afraid to experiment with mascara.

The only thing I do like about this product is the lower lash brush which is useful otherwise...don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;d think that this would be a great product, but the different brush shapes don&#x27;t make a difference, and the purple side dries up very quickly. and I keep it screwed on very tightly all the time. go figure. Maybelline is good for lip products, not eye products.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara - the two brush sizes is perfect!</li>
    <li> This mascara sheds black flecks of product once it dries. I have to clean these flecks from my eye areas several times a day. Also, it clumps. I will stick with the original Maybelline mascara that I have been using for years.</li>
    <li> i am absolutly obsessed with this product its so amazing and perf. its kinda a gel formula so it holds and its easy to take off</li>
    <li> Excellent 100% Recommended</li>
    <li> Love this mascara....dislike the quantity!  Can you separate them into two regular sized tubes?  I use way more of the upper lash than the lower lash part.  I would definitely by the two separately but don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll continue buying them in this design.</li>
    <li> This mascara worked fine the first few times. Then both wands started gunking up. I would have to clean the mascara gunk off each wand before I could use it. Even after washing, they would immediately gunk up. Spend more $ to get a better brand.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quite a wonderful product. The only complaint I have is that there&#x27;s so little of the mascara in it. But that can&#x27;t be helped.</li>
    <li> Like the two different wands</li>
    <li> Honestly, don&#x27;t waste your money on this, i was so happy once it got it. BUT it was a great disappointment to me, my lashes came out very clumpy and stayed thin, they didn&#x27;t get any volume. The only thing i like about is the lower lash brush, that works better than the top. So i don&#x27;t recomend it, it might not work for me because i have semi- long/full lashes but i dont know, i just didnt enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Worst Maybelline mascara so far, total waste. Lower wand...is ridiculous. Stick to Falsies or the new Chaotic (which isn&#x27;t Chaotic at all)</li>
    <li> i love this mascara! i love the effect it has on my lashes highly recommended to anybody who wants bigger lashes.</li>
    <li> Great Idea With the Two Applicator Brushes&lt;br /&gt;Maybelline had a new, thinking out of the box,  inovation with this product. It works great, is easy to apply. I really appreciate the thought  that went into this design. The small brush is a great help. Good job folks.,</li>
