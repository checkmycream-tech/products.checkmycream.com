      <li>I tested your COVERGIRL products for free, but all opinions are your own.</li>
      <li>so many lipsticks do not look well on me.</li>
      <li>At first look the color seemed to be way too bright</li>
      <li>I tried it for free thanks to Influenster, but all my opinions are my own!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really lovely on and the application is smooth.</li>
      <li>Easy application for a non-makeup expert like myself.</li>
      <li>I also would prefer the old two step one more because its more of a glossy.(the way I liked it)</li>
      <li>The lipstick didn&#x27;t transfer to my teeth which was also a huge plus.  </li>
      <li>These type of lipsticks dont come around alot, and this is a huge winner in my book.</li>
      <li>(he looks better in pink too lol).</li>
      <li>It took hours sipping coffee and drinking water to even begin to get light.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy I got to try the red rouge!</li>
      <li>I received this lipstick for free for testing purposes.</li>
      <li>I did get this product for free for review from Influenster.  </li>
      <li>I liked the shade and the way it applied on nicely but would go more for the pink.</li>
      <li>I received this product for free and I was excited to give it a try.  </li>
      <li>It applied so super smooth onto my lips, there was no tugging at all.</li>
      <li>I tested CoverGirl Outlast Longwear Lipstick for free but all of the opinions above are my own.</li>
      <li>I received this lipstick free for testing purposes through influenster and although the color is not one I would have chosen for myself, I tried it and ended up liking it far more than I would have guessed.</li>
      <li>It even made it through a quick snack at lunch time.</li>
      <li>It looked fabulous as a pop of color and not silly like I imagined.  </li>
      <li>Really pretty!</li>
      <li>This lipstick works exactly how I want it to!</li>
      <li>was awesome very vibrant red shade and only had to glide onto the lips a once to get a bold color.</li>
      <li>On me, it makes a red stain like the kind that you get when drinking fruit punch or eating cherry ice pops.</li>
      <li>My lipstick or gloss is usually warm off by breakfast and needs to be reapplied all day;  Outlast Longwear did stay on for several hours.  </li>
      <li>CoverGirl Outlast was moist without being gooey and kept a fresh color.</li>
      <li>The Red Rouge color was on the blue side of red (instead of being closer to orange), which I liked, but the color was still very bright and a lot closer to a bright hot pink than I was expecting.</li>
      <li>During work hours, I used 1 or 2 swipes on my lips, and had a perfect pink pout, it lasted all day, (even threw lunch) without flaking or looking dry.</li>
      <li>My lips also feel hydrated after I use it which was nice because a lot of lipstick makes my lips feel chapped and dry.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It didn&#x27;t fade very fast.</li>
      <li>Thanks again!</li>
      <li>I was feeling adventurous that day and tried the Red Rouge.  </li>
      <li>The color was a little too bright for my VERY pale complexion, but I&#x27;m sure it would look amazing on many other women.</li>
      <li>The staying power of this lipstick is defiantly top notch, I wore this lipstick to a wedding recently and this lipstick lasted through the whole night after drinking, eating and kisses on cheeks.</li>
      <li>The only con I could find was it transfers pretty easy.</li>
      <li>Not enough scent to become distracting or overpowering but enough a light and enjoyable</li>
      <li>Went on easily, and only had to be reapplied after eating/drinking.  </li>
      <li>For the most part it lasted the whole day, with slight touch ups here and there, but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
      <li>I put this lipstick on in the morning, went to Disneyland, ate lunch, drank Starbucks, and at the end of the day the color was still pretty vibrant.  </li>
      <li>The color was bright and fun, but looked a little different on than in the package.  </li>
      <li>that was much improved compared to my gloss.  </li>
      <li>received the shade Red Rouge free from Influenster in the I</li>
      <li>I would really like to try this in a pink as that&#x27;s more my style</li>
      <li>Can I just start by saying WOW!!!</li>
      <li>what I can tell with the one day experience, it went on smooth and really stayed for long time.</li>
      <li>and it looks like a whole new color.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly, light weight, doesn&#x27;t clump up and get dry.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this lipstick to anyone on the market.</li>
      <li>This lipstick is really nice because it does not rub off nearly as easily as other lip colors, especially the &amp;#34;moisture adding&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It is ok, but I like something a little thicker...</li>
      <li>The smell is also reminiscent of a balm that I would layer on in elementary school.</li>
      <li>I really like the product, though, and I am excited to try out some of the other colors that are offered.</li>
      <li>It reminds me more of a lip stain because of how long it last.</li>
      <li>I thought because it was labelled &amp;#34;outlast&amp;#34; that it would be a bit thicker and wouldn&#x27;t need to be applied as often as a normal lipstick, but that wasn&#x27;t my experience.  </li>
      <li>I normally don&#x27;t wear lipstick because it always rubs off the middle of my lips, leaving a bright ring around the outside, and it is such a hassle to constantly have to reapply the color.</li>
      <li>then i usually wear but it glides on smooth not that sticky feeling like most other.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> First off, I love this color!!!! On me, it makes a red stain like the kind that you get when drinking fruit punch or eating cherry ice pops. The smell is also reminiscent of a balm that I would layer on in elementary school. Not enough scent to become distracting or overpowering but enough a light and enjoyable smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this out at school before waiting for the big day. As a preschool teacher, I talk tons and my lipstick usually starts to crack and dry within the first couple of hours. CoverGirl Outlast was moist without being gooey and kept a fresh color. I even forgot that I was wearing it until a student complimented me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t fade very fast. It took hours sipping coffee and drinking water to even begin to get light. It even made it through a quick snack at lunch time. I love that none of it transferred to my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a great lipstick. I plan on purchasing other colors but will definitely enjoy this one as often as possible.</li>
    <li> This lipstick stays on.  I ate, I drank, I went about my day and so did this lipstick.  I think I only reapplied once in a whole 16 hour day and that was just out of habit.  The only con I could find was it transfers pretty easy. My man doesn&#x27;t look as good in this shade as I do!  I did get this product for free for review from Influenster.  I would really like to try this in a pink as that&#x27;s more my style so I plan on buying one soon (he looks better in pink too lol).</li>
    <li> i got this lipstick and its wonderful darker then i usually wear but it glides on smooth not that sticky feeling like most other. i got this for free from influnester.com in my samples for testing them out and to me its worth buying its a wonderful brand and the color is bright and beautiful  i got this in my i do voxbox and i recommend this to anyone&lt;br /&gt;katrina</li>
    <li> I really loved that it has the benefit of &amp;#34;layering&amp;#34; and staying on! During work hours, I used 1 or 2 swipes on my lips, and had a perfect pink pout, it lasted all day, (even threw lunch) without flaking or looking dry. Then for the evening all you have to do is add a couple more swipes and it looks like a whole new color. and still lasts without all the cakey dry flakes. These type of lipsticks dont come around alot, and this is a huge winner in my book. The color is perfect for all skin tones (even me who has yellowish skin tone with rosy cheeks!) I am obsessed and cant wait to buy in more colors! Courtesy of influenster for testing purposes!</li>
    <li> I received this product for free and I was excited to give it a try.  The color was bright and fun, but looked a little different on than in the package.  I thought because it was labelled &amp;#34;outlast&amp;#34; that it would be a bit thicker and wouldn&#x27;t need to be applied as often as a normal lipstick, but that wasn&#x27;t my experience.  It is ok, but I like something a little thicker...</li>
    <li> I wanted to express in my own opinion how much I enjoyed testing this product in my i do vox box sample, LOVE IT. Goes on smoothly, light weight, doesn&#x27;t clump up and get dry. I will no be using this product daily in my normal makeup routine. So pumped.</li>
    <li> This outlast lipstick works great. I have it in 3 different colors and it stays on for awhile. I do have to re-apply throughout the day but only a time or two and the color lasts and doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips. Easy application for a non-makeup expert like myself. I did receive this CoverGirl product for free to test and was so impressed I purchased 2 more shades.</li>
    <li> Can I just start by saying WOW!!! This lipstick is INCREDIBLE! I put some on in the morning and it stayed on through three meals, countless bottles of water and even lasted well into my night out! It is the perfect shade of red and I love that it starts semisheer and then can be built up to an opaque matte finish! It wasn&#x27;t drying at all, which was shocking, since most long wear Lip products are. I received this in my Influenster box, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I received this lipstick free for testing purposes through influenster and although the color is not one I would have chosen for myself, I tried it and ended up liking it far more than I would have guessed. I did find this lipstick to be a little drying, the color did last for several hours without needing reapplication. Although I did receive this product free for tearing purposes, all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Ireceived this product for test andd review purposes of Influenster. I tested your COVERGIRL products for free, but all opinions are your own. I really liked this lipstick. It smells great.</li>
    <li> This lipstick works exactly how I want it to! It is so moisturizing and the color is vivid. It&#x27;s almost like putting on colored ChapStick. It even has a pleasant scent and not the yucky lipstick smell a lot of them have. I have bought super expensive lipstick that doesn&#x27;t work as well as this does. The color lasts a long time even through eating and drinking. I highly recommend this lipstick to anyone on the market. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free but the opinion is my honest judgement of the product.</li>
    <li> I received this product in my Influenster in my I Do VoxBox. I have a medium to dark tone skin, so sadly Red is not my color. I would not use it regularly, However, for testing purposes I did put it on once when I was staying in home for the day. I wish I had a received a better color suitable to my skin tone, because I really liked it :)&lt;br /&gt;From what I can tell with the one day experience, it went on smooth and really stayed for long time. I ate my breakfast, had herbal tea, and a few glasses of water, and when I looked in the mirror, it was still on and there was no chapped layers or dryness on my lips, like some other long wear lipsticks leave.  One thing with most of my current lipsticks is the need to reapply after every single meal or drink, which totally irritates me. However, definitely happy about Covergirl Outlast Lipstick, I will surely be interested in trying a color more suitable to my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;I tested this product for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I put this lipstick on in the morning, went to Disneyland, ate lunch, drank Starbucks, and at the end of the day the color was still pretty vibrant.  I noticed it wore off a bit uneven, but I over it with a standard balm (I use EOS) and that revived it and created an even color again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One issue with longwear lipstick is it&#x27;s drying effect, however, this lipstick did not dry out my lips as others do. The color is great, it showed a bit orange on me, but it still looked great. I would definitely recommend this product as an affordable longwear lipstick.  I am looking into trying other colors in this brand.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this from @Influenster and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.  Went on easily, and only had to be reapplied after eating/drinking.  Great color and didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;bleed&amp;#34; around my lips.  Really loved it, and would recommend!! I received this COVERGIRL products for free, but all opinions are your own.</li>
    <li> So Awesome! Love this color! Makes my eyes pop! I tried it for free thanks to Influenster, but all my opinions are my own! Thanks again!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS LIPSTICK! I normally don&#x27;t wear lipstick because it always rubs off the middle of my lips, leaving a bright ring around the outside, and it is such a hassle to constantly have to reapply the color. This lipstick is really nice because it does not rub off nearly as easily as other lip colors, especially the &amp;#34;moisture adding&amp;#34; kinds. The Red Rouge color was on the blue side of red (instead of being closer to orange), which I liked, but the color was still very bright and a lot closer to a bright hot pink than I was expecting. The color was a little too bright for my VERY pale complexion, but I&#x27;m sure it would look amazing on many other women. I really like the product, though, and I am excited to try out some of the other colors that are offered.

    <li> I received Covergirl Outlast Longwear Lipstick in Red Rough about a mouth ago through Influenster I do Vox box.  I usually prefer a natural look for my make up with a very subtle glossy lip color.  I was feeling adventurous that day and tried the Red Rouge.  It looked fabulous as a pop of color and not silly like I imagined.  My lipstick or gloss is usually warm off by breakfast and needs to be reapplied all day;  Outlast Longwear did stay on for several hours.  I did reapply at lunch time but that was much improved compared to my gloss.  I&#x27;m glad I was able to sample this color because I would have never tried it on my own.  I tested this COVERGIRL products for free, but all opinions are your own.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally wear lipstick because I am too impatient to keep reapplying it during the day.  After receiving a sample of this lipstick in a voxbox from influenster I was pleased to learn that this lipstick stays on through almost anything.  I drank coffee, ate, and after a few hours I still didn&#x27;t have to reapply it.  The lipstick didn&#x27;t transfer to my teeth which was also a huge plus.  My lips also feel hydrated after I use it which was nice because a lot of lipstick makes my lips feel chapped and dry.  I got a free sample of this color, but I will be buying more colors!</li>
    <li> This lipstick is very vibrant and has long lasting power. I tend to have very dry lips so many lipsticks do not look well on me. This one wasn&#x27;t drying and actually gave my lips the moisture they needed. I received this lipstick for free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I very rarely wear anything on my lips because usually it doesn&#x27;t last 10 minutes if I&#x27;m lucky but I got these from influenster in a voxbox an I was skeptical to wear it until I put it on an it made my lips feel awesome! An it lasted a couple of hours which was surprising since I smoke! These are my opinions</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this Covergirl outlast longwear lipstick. It applied so super smooth onto my lips, there was no tugging at all. The color pay off on this lipstick was awesome very vibrant red shade and only had to glide onto the lips a once to get a bold color. It was moisturizing very similar to a lip balm but this stayed put. The staying power of this lipstick is defiantly top notch, I wore this lipstick to a wedding recently and this lipstick lasted through the whole night after drinking, eating and kisses on cheeks. There was no transfer at all, once I applied it this stayed on and didn’t move at all. It does have a faint smell but it was a sweet smell that did go away after a moment. The lasting power of this and the fact it didn’t transfer is reason enough to recommend this lipstick from Covergirl. Especially if you don’t want to fuss over your makeup all you do is apply and you’re ready for day or night.  *I tested your COVERGIRL products for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Long lasting and even color. The lipstick stayed put for a few hours until I ate and drank. Even after dinner there was still a tint of color left on my lips. I would recommend as it didn&#x27;t feel greasy or too dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the shade Red Rouge free from Influenster in the I Do Vox Box, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Received this from Influester for testing purposes and reviewing. I liked the shade and the way it applied on nicely but would go more for the pink. I also would prefer the old two step one more because its more of a glossy.(the way I liked it)</li>
    <li> Really pretty! I&#x27;m so happy I got to try the red rouge! It&#x27;s really lovely on and the application is smooth. I&#x27;m on the paler side and this definitely makes my lips pop. For the most part it lasted the whole day, with slight touch ups here and there, but it&#x27;s well worth it. I&#x27;m not too sure about the other colors of the outlast longwear lipstick, but definitely try the red! You won&#x27;t be disappointed! *I received this product for testing purposes from Influenster.*</li>
    <li> This is a long lasting, easy to apply lipstick. It reminds me more of a lip stain because of how long it last. At first look the color seemed to be way too bright but once you put it on it ends up looking great and made my lips pop. I am not a big lipstick person but this is definitely one of my new favorites. Great price too! I tested CoverGirl Outlast Longwear Lipstick for free but all of the opinions above are my own.</li>
