      <li>These razors are the best price I can find anywhere</li>
      <li>and they work great!</li>
      <li>Not the best Gillette Sensor blades I have used.  </li>
      <li>Great Respone time receiving this!</li>
      <li>This was the perfect solution.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best there is!  </li>

      <li>GREAT PRODUCT IN THESE DAYS WITH 27 LEVELS OF BLADES IN ONE RAZOR,</li>
      <li>Great razor blades.  </li>
      <li>and he is happy once again to shave.  </li>
      <li>I am happy, happy.</li>
      <li>Great quality.</li>
      <li>Good deal.</li>
      <li>This package is a good pack of 20...</li>
      <li>/&gt;While I prefer my safety razor setup (based on cost of blades, if nothing else), I&#x27;d forgotten what a good shave the Sensor gives.</li>
      <li>A good balance between price and comfort.</li>
      <li>this is a good value for me.</li>
      <li>Not so good.</li>
      <li>GOOD</li>
      <li>fit razor perfectly.</li>
      <li>Get a good shaving cream and brush and you will think you bought the top of the line shaver!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t get as many shaves as the ones that I buy at the drugstore!</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to find these on here on a subscribe option.</li>
      <li>They work nicely.</li>
      <li>I have used this older model for years and it still gives the best and closest shave I have ever had.  </li>
      <li>they give me a clean, close,comfortable shave, and it&#x27;s also great for me too because I shave my head.</li>
      <li>The product came in very early and as comparsion shopping it&#x27;s the best deal.</li>
      <li>They are Made in Germany and are by far the best Gillette Sensor razors I have used.</li>
      <li>Merchandise exactly as promised, great service: ordered on Tuesday got it on Thursday conveniently in my mailbox.</li>
      <li>I love the sensor razor and blades.  </li>
      <li>Those multi-bladed razors with more than two blades lose their ability for getting into corners and around lumps and bumps.  </li>
      <li>but I need to replace more often because the skin guard reduces the friction.  </li>
      <li>Even with the shipping charges they were a better buy.</li>
      <li>My husband was so pleased we found this product at Amazon.  </li>
      <li>It seems like there is a premium charged based more on need than cost to manufacture, advertise and ship.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see the value of shaving devices with 3 or 4 or 5 blades, except as a way for companies to force more money from the consumer.</li>
      <li>Nothing give a better shave.</li>
      <li>and I love them.  </li>
      <li>I now believe that Sensor II is better value for the money.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Quality of the blades is ok.  </li>
      <li>(Purchased from Razors N More).</li>
      <li>I was glad to find these blades for my Father-in-law.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just glad Amazon has them.</li>
      <li>I love the sensor  blades  </li>
      <li>Love these blades.</li>
      <li>This is a worthwhile product.</li>
      <li>I have been using the SENSOR razor since it was introduced more than 20 years ago.  </li>
      <li>My husband prefers 2-blade razors over those with more blades.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel the need for more than 2 blades on my cartridge.</li>
      <li>Ok, so when I was out of work for a bit</li>
      <li>By 1995, I&#x27;d moved on to something that was supposed to do a better job with razor bumps.</li>
      <li>I like the Sensor better than the fusion</li>
      <li>but i was able to throw this in an order and have it delivered rather then making a run to a store and having to remember to get these.</li>
      <li>The blades last at best 2 days while I used to get 5-7 days out of them.  </li>
      <li>This was after a long surcharge for best price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sticking with these cartridges and so glad to see they are still available.</li>
      <li>Therefore, thus, hence, and in other words two bladed cartridges are perfect for me.  </li>
      <li>Considering the balance of quality, affordability, comfort and precision, there is no other cartridge blade on the market more superior than the Gillette Sensor.</li>
      <li>Works fine.  </li>
      <li>These work fine</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not so easy to find these at the local drugstore, but the price and availability here on Amazon is great.  </li>
      <li>No wonder the price was so cheap.  </li>
      <li>Great company to do business with I would us them again if prices remain low.</li>
      <li>I have used Gillette items for over sixty years and they fit the need.</li>
      <li>I give the original Sensor blades 10 out of 10.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the price is the best one out there,</li>
      <li>original product at reduced price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the original Gillette sensor razor for years.  </li>
      <li>suffered significantly without a commensurate or even any improvement in shave quality...</li>
      <li>I still have my original Sensor handle and continue to purchase the blades through Amazon.  </li>
      <li>With this offer, I received the highest quality product at a good savings over local stores.  </li>
      <li>overall a good blade</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good solid design that&#x27;s stood the test of time.</li>
      <li>although not a bad one either...</li>
      <li>and the price is right but not quite as comfortable as the Excel.  </li>
      <li>This makes it perfect for the hard to shave areas around your nose, dimple in chin, smile lines, etc.  </li>
      <li>In a world where most razors have 3 or more blades, I have continued to use the double bladed Gillette Sensor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They came in the mail quickly.</li>
      <li>When you shave your head, you need a razor that flexes around the lumps and bumps and gives you a nice close shave at the same time.  </li>
      <li>The only downside I see is my own fault.</li>
      <li>economical purchase.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The blades fulfilled by Amazon were fine, but I question $1.80 per blade price, which is cheap compared to buying them in the local pharmacy.  </li>
      <li>Genuine Gillette Sensor cartridges manufactured in Germany for distribution in Australia and New Zealand.</li>
      <li>Gillette designed this two blade razor at their peak, and it contains exactly the right number of blades.  </li>
      <li>This was a good buy for great blades that are beconig harder and harder o find in local stores.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Product is exactly as described.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better and the blades last a LOT longer.</li>
      <li>and this beats the purpose of having a Mach 3 in the first place.  </li>
      <li>Those Gillette imitators make crummy products that will give you cuts and will clog with the first swipe.  </li>
      <li>Much recommended!</li>
      <li>I have been using the Gillette line since I first started shaving forty years ago, first the TracII, then the Sensor and the so-called Excel.  </li>
      <li>and this was the first time I purchased the cartridges online.  </li>
      <li>This cost savings is further multiplied by the fact that, in order to fit more blades on those other razors, the blades are made much thinner and are more prone to wearing out.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t imagine how three or four or five blades could possibly give a closer shave and certainly cost more.</li>
      <li>It is becoming more and more difficult to find the Gillette Sensor blades stocked at retailers or wholesalers.  </li>
      <li>They give a nice clean shave and the blades last us a week which is a lot better than how quickly newer razors seem to last since they are so thin to have so many blades in a cartridge.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using sensor razor for over 15 years and this was the first time I purchased the cartridges online.  Since the cost to buy retail is getting crazy, I thought I would give it a try.  Wow, what a mistake,  the cartridges are cheap and cause me numerous cuts, abrasions, etc.  Not a quality product at all.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed&lt;br /&gt;Tom</li>
    <li> A good balance between price and comfort. I can usually get two daily shaves out of each before they get dull, and they rarely nick or irritate. I&#x27;ve tried Sensor Excels also, and while those feel a little less irritating, for me the difference is slight.</li>
    <li> I have been using the SENSOR razor since it was introduced more than 20 years ago.  Gillette keeps inrocuding newer, more expensive razors.  The latest, Proglide Fusion has been so heavily disocunted that I deided to give it a try.  It is a perfectly fine razor once you get used to maneuvering the rather large head in tight spaces, like around your nose.      For the first couple days, I shaved half my face with the old and the other half with the new and really couldn&#x27;t see/feel much of a difference.  I continued to use the new one for about 3 weeks and then went back to the SENSOR.  It shaves every bit a well as the newer one and for about one third the cost for the new blades.  I rue the day when they stop making these blades.  This seems to be in the planning stages as they are now encouraging people to not buy MACH3 and switch to Proglide.  For what it&#x27;s worth, I also prefer the SENSOR to the slightly pricier SENSOR EXCELL.</li>
    <li> I was glad to find these blades for my Father-in-law.  They came in the mail quickly. Made him very happy.</li>
    <li> Gillette Sensor ---------Are OK&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Sensor EXCEL ---Are GOOD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Receiving the plain Sensor blades was my fault entirely. I will pay attention to the details the next time I order!</li>
    <li> My razors arrived in about 4 business days.  They are Made in Germany and are by far the best Gillette Sensor razors I have used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Gillette Sensor blades for years but this batch is bad.  A blade doesn&#x27;t last for a single shave. Previously I would get several shaves from a single blade. Looks like Gillette quality control has gone bad or they are trying to get me to buy one of the new razors.</li>
    <li> When I read these words  \\&quot;Gillette Sensor Shaving Cartridges for Men, 10-Count Packages (Pack of 2)\\&quot; I thought I would get 2 packages of ten.    Maybe I can&#x27;t read or add    Maybe the ad is misleading</li>
    <li> Not the same as the drugstore. I can&#x27;t get as many shaves as the ones that I buy at the drugstore!</li>
    <li> Merchandise exactly as promised, great service: ordered on Tuesday got it on Thursday conveniently in my mailbox. Definitely will order again.Twice cheaper than my neighborhood store.Highly recommend the company.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping from NY to PA (Purchased from Razors N More). Ordered Wednesday night, received in the USPS mail on Friday. Genuine Gillette Sensor cartridges manufactured in Germany for distribution in Australia and New Zealand. For $1.07 each, I&#x27;ll take those Aussie and Kiwi razors and run. Received 4 packs of 5 cartridges for a total of 20 cartridges.</li>
    <li> The Gillette business model is cheap razors with expensive blades.  This offering lets you shave a little off the expensive blades portion of their plan.  These are not knock-off imposters.  Anyone who&#x27;s used a generic refill for a Gillette product knows there really is a difference in razor blades.  With this offer, I received the highest quality product at a good savings over local stores.  Also, to follow up on an earlier reviewer&#x27;s experience, I received the product as described--2 packs of 10 razors, for a total of 20.</li>
    <li> As someone who has not embraced the quattro and ocho blade trends and their hefty prices, I continue to buy Gillette Sensors with their old school two blades.  I have been shaving with these blades for 10 years.  I can say without hesitation that the quality of the blades has deteriorated.  The blades last at best 2 days while I used to get 5-7 days out of them.  I will probably switch to the sensor excel with the lubrication strip</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find this product now and the thought of shaving with a razor that has 20 blades frightens me!  Seriously, how many blades can you put on a razor!?  PLEASE BRING THESE BACK!!!!</li>
    <li> In a world where most razors have 3 or more blades, I have continued to use the double bladed Gillette Sensor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades fulfilled by Amazon were fine, but I question $1.80 per blade price, which is cheap compared to buying them in the local pharmacy.  It seems like there is a premium charged based more on need than cost to manufacture, advertise and ship.</li>
    <li> Not so good. Dull shave</li>
    <li> Like many of the other reviewers, using cartridges with more than two blades has never really worked for me. Sensor cartridges give me a close shave while producing far fewer cuts, and they last me about a week. At this price, that&#x27;s about 25 cents per use -- far less than other cartridges.</li>
    <li> These cartridges are the best Gillette has made and they keep trying to improve on perfection and keep failing IMO.&lt;br /&gt;If they do away with these I guess I will just grow a beard. The blades are increasingly hard to find. I&#x27;m just glad Amazon has them.</li>
    <li> I just recieved in the mail the sensor blades- 10 count packages (pack of 2) which is and should be 20 blades in all. that is  what I got. For the people who were ripped off and only got 10 blades please write amazon.com and make sure you get two packages of ten  sensor blades&#x3D;20 in all. I tell you I love the sensor  blades  they give me a clean, close,comfortable shave, and it&#x27;s also great for me too because I shave my head. This is a worthwhile product. Much recommended!</li>
    <li> Great company to do business with I would us them again if prices remain low. This was after a long surcharge for best price. Great quality.</li>
    <li> Ok, so when I was out of work for a bit a few years ago i sat down and looked at all my expenditures at razors came up on the list. After some experimentation I came to the conclusion that something like a sensor two-blade razor was basically as effective as other more expensive options with three or four blades on them. This cost savings is further multiplied by the fact that, in order to fit more blades on those other razors, the blades are made much thinner and are more prone to wearing out. So a sensor blade like these are much cheaper and seem to last longer. This package is a good pack of 20...I&#x27;m not sure if the price is the best one out there, but i was able to throw this in an order and have it delivered rather then making a run to a store and having to remember to get these.</li>
    <li> I love the sensor razor and blades.  Really does the job and the blades are expensive but they last a while.</li>
    <li> These blades seem to last longer than the newer one do and cost allot less than all these 5 bladed razors.</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as described. My husband prefers 2-blade razors over those with more blades. Shipping is consistently fast through the autoship program.</li>
    <li> Great Respone time receiving this! Would order from here again. Recomend to anyone looking for this product. This is the cheapest place I found the Gillette Sensor Cartridges</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat this blade. The Fusion gives me a slightly closer shave and takes fewer strokes to shave a given area, which saves some time, but it&#x27;s not worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I have used these blades for years, and sometimes I have trouble finding them.  This was the perfect solution.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Love these blades. Been using this type since the 90&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve tried the fancy 3/4/5 blade razors and they aren&#x27;t needed. These rock.</li>
    <li> I have used these for a long time and like them. I suppose at some point I&#x27;ll have to start using one of the newer multi-blade razors, but these have always worked well for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the original Gillette sensor razor for years.  It&#x27;s the best there is!  Nothing give a better shave.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see Gillette Sensor blades on the shelf any longer. I don&#x27;t see the value of shaving devices with 3 or 4 or 5 blades, except as a way for companies to force more money from the consumer. So despite the price demanded for 2 blades I continue to shave. I really hate whiskers itching my skin.</li>
    <li> I have had my Gilette Sensor razor for probably close to 15 years now. Finding a 2 blade razor these days is tough, if not impossible. As long as someone makes blades for this thing, it is the one for me. The only downside I see is my own fault. I bought these and after getting them realize I have the Sensor Excel. The only difference that I can see is that the Excel has little rubber squgees obelow the 2 blades where this one does not. Doubt it really makes any difference though.</li>
    <li> I usually buy cheap discount blades. I thought maybe I was just too rushed, or was using the blades too long, because I am always cutting myself. Well, I got the expensive brand name blades and managed to not slice myself up. They are much better quality, but I wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> Even after all the crazy inventions in the last 15 years for shaving razors, I still prefer the Gilette Sensor.  Two blades is more than enough, and each cartridge lasts me roughly 60 shaves with few signs of dulling.</li>
    <li> Not the best Gillette Sensor blades I have used.  Made in Brazil ?  Not sure why but quality seems a bit off.</li>
    <li> Again, I have been frustrated not being able to find the Sensor Cartridges but once again I found the item when I went to Amazon.Com.</li>
    <li> What can you say about these? They work nicely. Not real good for heavy course areas. Must apply  a lot of pressure to remove that type of beard. The razors today simply do not shave close enough, really. I think the manufactures made cartridges years ago that really gave a close shave but must stopped because of, who knows, complaints of nicks???</li>
    <li> People keep telling me to up grade, get the newest with five thousand blades. NEVER!&lt;br /&gt;It provides a clean, easy, shave, especially around the lips and nose, all the others do not get close enough.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received several orders of these blades over the past few years, and they seem to last longer than what I used to buy in the store. The price is lower, and you don&#x27;t have to search for them. Good deal.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to find these on here on a subscribe option. Less enthused when I read further and found out they won&#x27;t ship to Alaska because this is a decent price on these cartridges and the subscribe option looks great.&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I have been using Sensors for the last 20 years. They give a nice clean shave and the blades last us a week which is a lot better than how quickly newer razors seem to last since they are so thin to have so many blades in a cartridge. I also like the smaller head for getting around curves on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;We have tried some of the newer razors with more blades and other options, and keep going back to the Sensor. It&#x27;s a good solid design that&#x27;s stood the test of time.</li>
    <li> After using an electric for 5 years, I decided to try a blade again and I had forgotten how close a shave a guy can get with these blades. I can get at least 3-4 weeks of shaves on a cartridge before having to replace so this is a good value for me. The price here was half of what I&#x27;d pay at even Sams Club, so this is the place to buy if you want this type of shaver.</li>
    <li> Weird.  Wore out very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not convinced they aren&#x27;t counterfeit, or at least lesser quality than is the standard for the US.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 28 and still use Sensor Excel. Didn&#x27;t feel the need to switch. These cartridges work as well as ever. I don&#x27;t feel the need for more than 2 blades on my cartridge. Gillette probably doesn&#x27;t like customers like me.</li>
    <li> I agree with Mark&#x27;s review.  Two blades is enough!  I thought I purchased the Sensor Excel with the rubber skin guard. No wonder the price was so cheap.  I used to buy at Costco but they no longer sell them. These work fine but I need to replace more often because the skin guard reduces the friction.  overall a good blade and the price is right but not quite as comfortable as the Excel.  My brother uses the old safety razors and swears by them but he takes twice as long to shave.</li>
    <li> This is how you should buy these</li>
    <li> I had been buying my resor blades until I found these and discover a way to save money. Even with the shipping charges they were a better buy.</li>
    <li> My husband was so pleased we found this product at Amazon.  Can&#x27;t seem to find in the stores anywhere anymore.  He had rationed his last ones and was finally out.  I ordered these and he is happy once again to shave.  Says nothing else compares.</li>
    <li> For a close shave, it does the job.They beat the price at Walmart, and no sales tax. Will use them again.</li>
    <li> Great razor blades.  Can&#x27;t find them in stores anymore, as everyone pushes the three-blade models.  In my experience these shave very well -- as good if not better than three-blade --  stay sharp considerably longer, and are a better value.  I have been using these for well over ten years -- possibly even fifteen at this point -- and have no reason to change.  I occasionally try a newer model, yet always return to the Sensor.</li>
    <li> I have not tried the Sensor version of these blades. Gillette may be trying to save costs at the expense of quality. Buy the Sensor Excel!</li>
    <li> This was a good buy for great blades that are beconig harder and harder o find in local stores. I dont need the new 3 and 4 blade cartridges.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Gillette line since I first started shaving forty years ago, first the TracII, then the Sensor and the so-called Excel.  I drew the line at three blades, though.  It&#x27;s not so easy to find these at the local drugstore, but the price and availability here on Amazon is great.  I find each one lasts for at least 10 shaves, and I have a pretty thick beard.  I can&#x27;t imagine how three or four or five blades could possibly give a closer shave and certainly cost more.</li>
    <li> did Gillette ever make anything bad???  Works fine.  I have used Gillette items for over sixty years and they fit the need.</li>
    <li> I only shave every other day  Therefore, thus, hence, and in other words two bladed cartridges are perfect for me.  Can you believe how expensive cartridges are?!!!  This vendor sells cartridges at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> i have had the same handle from gillette since the 1980&#x27;s the only problem is that these blades are discontinued so soon i will have to switch to another more advanced gillette system</li>
    <li> I started shaving with a Sensor when they were introduced in 1990. By 1995, I&#x27;d moved on to something that was supposed to do a better job with razor bumps. Ten or so years later, I started using a Gilette Fusion, but I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve since gone old-school with a double-edged safety razor, brush and shaving soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago, I was doing some organizing and found a Sensor handle and a pack of 5 cartridges in a bathroom drawer. They&#x27;ve been sitting there for almost 20 years, but I decided to give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I prefer my safety razor setup (based on cost of blades, if nothing else), I&#x27;d forgotten what a good shave the Sensor gives. The head is small (much small than a Fusion), so it just flies across my face without the need of battery assistance. It gives a nice shave, and is pretty forgiving in my usual trouble spots, so no nicks or razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I switched to the safety razor, I left a Fusion in my shave kit for going on the road. I&#x27;ve decided to swap it out for the Sensor instead. I like the Sensor better than the fusion, the cartridges are cheaper (though still too much), take up less room in the shave kit, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about batteries.</li>
    <li> Product fits my Gillette razor and come in brand new packaging. I received them in just a few days and would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I tried and tried to find these blades for a lower price everywhere and I just could not do it. I had to start buying disposable razors, the one&#x27;s with the blades in them and all they did was destroy my legs. There wasn&#x27;t one time that I didn&#x27;t have bloody spots all up and down them. I will continue buying my blades on Amazon....</li>
    <li> I have used this older model for years and it still gives the best and closest shave I have ever had.  No need to get a newer model or product when I already have the best.</li>
    <li> I rate as OK, because I feel that these blades are not a great deal, although not a bad one either...just Okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality of the blades is ok.  Although I think they should last a long.&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy these again.  I now believe that Sensor II is better value for the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Sensor Excel blades since I began shaving and I love them.  I mistakenly bought these regular Sensor blades from Amazon several months ago.  I figured that I&#x27;d give them a shot.  They leave my neck more cut and raw than the 1960s Safety Razor I used for awhile last year.  Maybe it&#x27;s MY face, but I prefer the Excel blades over the standard Sensors.</li>
    <li> These are the blades my husband always uses.  They are much more expensive to buy at a drug store or&lt;br /&gt;super market.  Got these on line in record time and they are the same quality as purchased any where.</li>
    <li> I have had everything from straight razors to single edge razors to multiple blade razors, with varying success for each.  These days I shave not only my face, but also my entire head which still has quite a lot of hair around the borders, not so much on top.  When you shave your head, you need a razor that flexes around the lumps and bumps and gives you a nice close shave at the same time.  And the last thing you need is a bunch of ingrown hairs from too close a shave.  Gillette designed this two blade razor at their peak, and it contains exactly the right number of blades.  Why anyone would want three, four, or even FIVE?!?? blades in a razor baffles me.  The two blades actually give you the benefit of having a nice smooth shave, no clogging, and flexibility of going around ears without nicks, scrapes, and cuts if you are careful.  Those multi-bladed razors with more than two blades lose their ability for getting into corners and around lumps and bumps.  Gillette should have stopped with this razor and its blades.  I still have my original Sensor handle and continue to purchase the blades through Amazon.  And for those of you who are real cheapskates, be forewarned:  Those Gillette imitators make crummy products that will give you cuts and will clog with the first swipe.  Stick to the real thing.  It&#x27;s better and the blades last a LOT longer.</li>
    <li> My husband is using these and seems to be working out great and at an awesome price. Seems these are so hard to find now a days but my husband like these for years and will continue as long as we can get them. Thanks!</li>
    <li> These razors are the best price I can find anywhere and they work great! Get a good shaving cream and brush and you will think you bought the top of the line shaver!</li>
    <li> I purchased these razor blades because they were cheaper on-line than at the local big-box store.  I used the first blade for about a month before it started getting quite dull.  I&#x27;ve used the Gillette Sensor Excel blades, and I&#x27;ve gotten 2 months worth of cutting out of them.  The next time I have to buy blades, I&#x27;ll go back to the Excel blades.</li>
    <li> Considering the balance of quality, affordability, comfort and precision, there is no other cartridge blade on the market more superior than the Gillette Sensor. I&#x27;ve used them all.....Trac II, Fusion, Mach 3, Schicks, Bics and all other disposables in between. I even had a run with a couple of the old school double edge razor blades (not practical for my lifestyle or skin), but the Sensor is simply the king of blades for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t say the same for the Excel version. The rubber micro fins just get in the way causing drag, which leads to cuts and irritation. I give the original Sensor blades 10 out of 10.</li>
    <li> The product came in very early and as comparsion shopping it&#x27;s the best deal. The package came in tact too</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT IN THESE DAYS WITH 27 LEVELS OF BLADES IN ONE RAZOR, HA HA. THIS TWO BLADE CARTRIDGE, FITS OUR OLD SENSOR RAZOR, VERY LIGHT, AND CUTS BEARD CLOSER THAN MANY OF THOSE HEAVY MULTIBLADE NEW RAZORS ON MARKET. HOPE THEY WILL STILL MANUFACTURE THESA AS I LUVS DEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Alright, I&#x27;m an old timer. Recently cut my beard and decided to go clean shaven. Searched my medicine cabinet and found my old Gillette Sensor razor with two back up blades. When they were finished, I searched for replacements without any luck until I found them on Amazon. Of course. I am happy, happy. A trip to my local drug store when I foolishly believed I&#x27;d find a simple replacement for the basic razor I&#x27;ve had for all those years turned out to be a joke. Have you seen these new razors? They cost an arm and a leg and feature multiple blades sufficient to carve a Thanksgiving turkey. And the replacement blades are pricey as all get out. I&#x27;m sticking with these cartridges and so glad to see they are still available.</li>
    <li> Gillette seems to be nudging consumers to switch to the more expensive and yet less effective three+-blade products that they came up with after introducing the revolutionary and highly effective Sensor blades.  It is becoming more and more difficult to find the Gillette Sensor blades stocked at retailers or wholesalers.  Thank you Amazon for continuing to carry this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy them in 10 to 20 packs at a time as I am concerned that Gillette (to the dismay of several consumers) may discontinue the product in a year or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note to P&amp;G and Gillette Product Management:  The innovation steps that followed the basic and amazingly effective Sensor blade have been mostly in the wrong direction.  The Sensor Excel (which followed the Sensor) underperforms the Sensor and leaves several spots partly shaved -- I tried the Excel several times and I tried to convince myself several times to switch to the Excel but why would one take a step in the wrong direction.  Then came the triple-blade Mach 3 -- what a disappointment as maneuvrability and reach suffered significantly without a commensurate or even any improvement in shave quality... so, with the Mach 3, you need to carry another helper blade (a two-blade Sensor) to reach tough spots or to shave curved parts of the chin.... and this beats the purpose of having a Mach 3 in the first place.  Please do not get me started on the 4-blade disasters...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottomline, please keep the Gillette Sensor basic blade on the market for the sake of mankind!</li>
    <li> I chose the \\&quot;sensor\\&quot; razor over the \\&quot;sensor excel\\&quot; due to the size of the cartridge.  This makes it perfect for the hard to shave areas around your nose, dimple in chin, smile lines, etc.  I have used both but prefer the regular sensor.  I read reviews that this razor only lasted a couple days...no way!  I have a tough beard and I&#x27;m on my second week with the same blade.  If anything, it seems to me that they have improved the blade&#x27;s durability.  I also did not have any of the product problems that were mentioned in the reviews.  I received 2 packages with 10 razors in each, just as if I had bought them at the store.</li>
    <li> economical purchase. fit razor perfectly.</li>
    <li> original product at reduced price. hard to find 2 blade razors still, so if you prefer those, order these from this vendor</li>
