      <li>I liked both, but I feel that the Afta gives a smoother shave than Williams.</li>
      <li>While it does a nice job conditioning your face post-shave, the scent stays with you for the day which is like a dime store after-shave.</li>
      <li>No, I don&#x27;t own any stock in Mennen or anything else.</li>
      <li>Pleasant smell, not too strong.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s serviceable after shave</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK, but I prefer Skin Bracer.</li>
      <li>Pack of 6 is a bit more than I can use, but will eventually use it up.  </li>
      <li>I tried 3 times and it didn&#x27;t get any better, so I chucked it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this Afta Mennen product because it smells nice, helps shaver to shave close and keeps your face smooth after shaving.</li>

      <li>My favorite for many years</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;m in the US Navy I have to shave daily. If I use a normal razor I get severe razor bumps all over my neck. So bad that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to shave for the next few days.  I found this product at the commissary one time tried it and no bumps.  I have been using it for years now and the only reason I&#x27;m writing a review is that online is the only place I can get it anymore.  Wal-Mart the commissary and most other places seem to have quit selling it since it works and isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34; like other products that are made by other companies and are only after shave lotions.</li>
    <li> This was my second order of this product.  It is a good pre-electric lotion, and often difficult to find in stores.  The price for this order with shipping is still cheaper that when purchase singly in stores..    2017-03-06  No change with current order...excellent product, Roy Thomas</li>
    <li> Shipped and received quickly.  Very pleased with my purchase.  Would definitely buy again from this seller.  I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for many years.  Smells great, goes on smoothly and dries quickly.</li>
    <li> I like Afta because it has a thicker consistency than all the others and therefore is easier and quicker to apply.  Been ordering it from Amazon for the past 3 years (since none of the drug stores carry it any more).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product because it has very good reviews , but it really disappointed me. It contains a lot of alcohol and all the other stuffs that I tried: gels, oils and creams worked better. On the other hand is cheap.</li>
    <li> I prefer afta over every other electric pre shave lotion, but often can&#x27;t find it in the Fort Worth Dallas Metroplex</li>
    <li> I purchase this great pre shave lotion, regularly, and have done so for years, in drug stores, however it was taken off the shelves of my local stores.  That caused me to purchase it on the internet through Amazon.  This is the first time the Amazon dealer has not sent the item right away.  I have been waiting weeks, but as yet I have not received my order.  So I don&#x27;t know what to think......keep waiting or cancel the original order.  I certainly cannot recommend the dealer.</li>
    <li> My Husband only use this and nothing else!! We didnt see it in our Walmary so we went online to find it; that&#x27;s how much he loves it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, makes shaving so much smoother and comfortable.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years. It&#x27;s not dry like the other brand.  For some reason, it is no longer available at Walmart.</li>
    <li> This is the best pre-electric shave conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. No built up, razor just glides over your skin. Has a pleasant smell and leaves your face feeling great.</li>
    <li> Nice and smooth on skin.</li>
    <li> very good.amazon is no. 1 in my book.</li>
    <li> received in good condition</li>
    <li> After having a beard for a number of years, I shaved it off and switched to an electric razor.  I started using the green pre-shave lotion for electric razors but it had such a strong smell that I switched to the Afra brand.  This is a much better product due to it being a lotion and doesn&#x27;t have such a strong smell.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I have very sensitive skin and stiff whiskers...which means electric shavers have a LOT of trouble getting at my whiskers. My typical routine required that I take a shower and shave IMMEDIATELY afterward, and I would still get a so-so shave and some skin burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion makes shaving a breeze! It shortens my time shaving. I actually get a shave almost as close as I&#x27;d get with a razor, minus the mess and potential cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is kind of strong, but not bad. I use lotion after shaving, and that seems to dilute the scent completely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it on and off for years.  I&#x27;ve never found anything better. I would recommend it to anyone using an electric razor.</li>
    <li> Makes shaving much more comfortable and less irritating after the shave.  A must for electric shavers.</li>
    <li> A great product that I would recommend.  It takes little for each application and is soothing for the skin.  Feels great after use.</li>
    <li> I have tried powders and oils and found this to be the best pre-electric shave on the market.  Especially great that Amazon carries it as none of my drugstores carry this anymore.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, smells great, close shave.  Glad I found this on Amazon as it is hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> just as advertised great option instead of going to store and buying single units at a much higher price will do it again</li>
    <li> I was sent the wrong product two times, I received after shave instead of the pre shave lotion I requested</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion that produces less drag on your skin and a closer shave with my Norelco. Hard to find but easy with Amazon.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for several years.  Best preshave available, but hard to find at local outlets.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> My husband is a happy camper.  We usually purchase this at Walmart or other stores and there hasn&#x27;t been any on the shelves.  If he&#x27;s happy, then so am I</li>
    <li> Been using for years nothing like it.</li>
    <li> My husband cannot find this product in town. Was so happy to find it on Amazon. It&#x27;s what he wanted</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Afta Mennen product because it smells nice, helps shaver to shave close and keeps your face smooth after shaving. No itching feeling like other liquid perfume juice. Thank you Mennen Afta.  I  would buy from Amazon.com again when I run out. This is already my second purchase for six at a time delivered to your door steps.</li>
    <li> The ONLY pre-electric my husband has used for 30 years.  He won&#x27;t even consider another brand.  I love it, too.  Pleasant smell, not too strong.</li>
    <li> I have been finding this pre-electric shave lotion harder and harder to find. My husband says it is the only brand that really works as a pre-shave lotion for electric razors.  After this being his signature scent for 44 years, our children and I associate the scent totally with him.  We LIKE that scent. Suggest you smell actual pre-shave or after-shave before buying, since it might be a scent you will be sniffing a long time.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this in stores to no avail. Amazon to the rescue yet again.  I love this product it works well and lubricates and makes a cleaner shave with your electric razor.  I highly recommend you give this product a shot, plus it smells absolutely fantastic!!!</li>
    <li> product was not pre-electric shave. It was after-shave whitch is supposed to have a blue label and I didnt notice it&lt;br /&gt;untill my old bottles ran out four months later so I didnt return it,Igave it away.</li>
    <li> My husband can not live without this and it&#x27;s very difficult to find in stores.  Walmart carries it but it is frequently sold out.  Prices are best at Amazon!</li>
    <li> I had been a long time Lectric Shave user and after seeing a review of Afta I decided to give it a shot.  I was a little worried about the fact that it came in a six pack and I could not find a reasonably priced one pack but since the price was relatively low I went for it.  I could not be happier with the switch.  Lectric Shave worked well but it was pretty much pure alcohol that would seem to run off my face or dry up a bit if I took to long.  Afta, however, is a creamier product that stays firmly on the face while you are using it.  I was concerned that it might gum up my Philips Norelco 1250X/46 Shaver 8100, but I haven&#x27;t noticed that it has really done anything different inside my shaver at all.  It also doesn&#x27;t burn quite as much as Lectric Shave could, although sometimes that is just what you need in the morning.</li>
    <li> Good product, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Great stuff for a close shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years - Won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> great price and a very good deal  will purchase again</li>
    <li> It came the next day we ordered, good stuff</li>
    <li> My husband has tried other types/brands and this is the ONLY one he wants to use.  Others are oily or don&#x27;t help with shaving.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 10 years now and have never been disappointed with it. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I use an electric razor. I don&#x27;t like alcohol based pre shave as they irritate my skin. I had been purchasing this product at a retail location until they did not have it and did not when it was coming in. Went to Amazon, bought the six pack and it is the same as what I bought retail.</li>
    <li> This pre-shave product is the best! It is cooling to apply and dries almost instantly, leaving a nice smooth surface for your shaver to slide on as it cuts the stubble close the skin with no irritation. You do not need an after shave under most circumstances as the skin is left soft and pliable.</li>
    <li> I have used this shave lotion for almost 20 years now. It has a classic scent and is very effective at prepping my beard for a shave. I highly recommend.  Unless you get the last ones and there aren&#x27;t any left for me. LOL</li>
    <li> Good price. Received as advertised!</li>
    <li> I used to shave dry with my electric Norelco.  I tried this and Williams Lectric Shave.  I liked both, but I feel that the Afta gives a smoother shave than Williams. In my opinion it smells better too, although I typically shower after shaving and wash either off. Using a preshave like this definately reduces razor burn and results in a much smoother shave. This is a good product and I don&#x27;t understand why I can&#x27;t seem to find it in any local stores.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and it has always worked great. It always me to always get a smooth and comfortable shave every time.</li>
    <li> I like this product very well!  I use it after washing my face and neck  The lotion must dry completely, to do the proper job. as  indicated on the back side of the product.  I use the product prior to shaving with an electric razor. I have never used this and use a blade shaver.&lt;br /&gt;  Oren M. Little</li>
    <li> This is an excellent pre-electric shave gel that works well and smells great. I&#x27;m not so sure about their &amp;#34;not greasy&amp;#34; claim, but I&#x27;m going to keep using it for as long as I can.</li>
    <li> this product is the best pre shave lotion. I get a much closer shave with it as well as it keeps the blades sharper.&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&amp;#34;t tried it you won&amp;#34;t believe how good it is, and the aroma is also great. I&amp;#34;ve used it for a long time. All I use is electric razor</li>
    <li> Great product, doesn&#x27;t gum up razor like some othet pre shaves.  Hard to find in most stores, glad it is available thru Amazon</li>
    <li> the best preshave product I know of. Does not clog shaver. Have used it for more years than I care to admit.</li>
    <li> Great lotion for the preshave to keep my face smooth for shaving w/ electric razor</li>
    <li> As a pre-shave product, Afta is far and away best for me than other possibilities.  Its lack of oil is especially helpful, and it does improve the ease of removing stubble each day.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this and now he can get it online.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It really works well, but hard to find (except on Amazon)</li>
    <li> I love this product and it is the only product left n the market that is a cream instead of a powder or liquid.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Afta Pre-electric Shave Lotion for many years.  It has become difficult to find in my area of residence.  It is more convenient to order it through Amazon. I would recommend who has a need for a good pre-electic shave lotion.</li>
    <li> I have a very soft beard that has never stood up for any foil or rotary electric razor, and I also have oily skin. From my teen years I  tried every possible way of shaving - barbers, safety blades, electrics, etc. and it was always a unpleasant (and painful!) chore. I actually wore a full beard from the age of 18 until my 50&#x27;s, when I suddenly had to look &amp;#34;corporate&amp;#34;, and that&#x27;s when I discovered Mennen Afta. I found that, if I simply wash my face with soap first to get rid of the oil, it worked better than any of the other products I tried, and made electric shaving quick and comfortable. I wondered if it was just the alcohol ingredient that was working, so I tried increasing the dilution to see what would happen and found that the product itself was actually producing the result. I used to buy it at Walmart, but recently found that all the pre-shave products were gone from the shelf. So I ordered it on Amazon, and it actually showed up the next day!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.  For some reason the pre-electric lotion (which I love) is hard to come by in the grocery stores near my home (HEB).  I&#x27;ve even had to try and buy it at Walmart with no luck...seem to always be out.  So, I&#x27;ve finally found a way to get as much as I need through the convenience of online shopping.  This is awesome!</li>
    <li> Great product reasonably priced at Amazon that I sometimes have trouble getting at my local stores.  This was much more convenient.</li>
    <li> If you want to walk around all day reeking with a nasty strong fragrance, you will like this pre-shave. I personally could not put up with it and had to jump back into the shower to scrub my face to eliminate the odor and I can still get a whiff of it now and then. Why do companies add such strong fragrances to products? Do we Americans smell so bad that we have to mask our body odor? I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
    <li> Have used Mennens for years and am very satisfied with your product. Bill Carlson</li>
    <li> I had a love hate relationship with my Braun Series 7.  I love the ease of electric shaving, but I hate if ever there&#x27;s the slightest bit of humidity or dampness to the beard it feels like I&#x27;m raking a chain saw over my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some research I came across this product. Never thought of using a &amp;#34;pre-shave&amp;#34; lotion.  If you&#x27;re like me and new to the concept, just apply to your skin, wait about 5 minutes for everything to dry. It dries up all the moisture on your hairs and makes them stiff which is the ideal condition for an electric shaver. The difference? Shaving now feels like a puck gliding across an air hockey table. There is literally to grabbing or tugging from the blades. Less irritation and a perfectly smooth and closer shave.</li>
    <li> I have been using Mennen \\&quot;Pre-Shave Gel\\&quot; for years. It sets up the hair, but most importantly it lubricates your skin and the blades so you get a smooth shave with no razor burn and the blades in your electric razor last 6 times as long as using nothing on your skin.  The reason I know this is because, the last time I bought a new electric razor, the instructions said, \\&quot;You don&#x27;t need to use any pre-shave or anything else on your skin before shaving.\\&quot; I thought, \\&quot;Great. This razor will save me the money I used to spend on pre-shave.\\&quot; Well, guess what; The blades in my new shaver only lasted for 6 months before being totally worn out. I used to get 3 years out of the blades, when using Mennen Gel Pre-Shave. The only problem now is finding Mennen Pre-Shave. Mennen does not make it anymore. I guess too many people believed the Razor Manufacturers statement about not having to use any pre-shave. I think, if you have oily skin, that MAY be true, but for me, it just doesn&#x27;t work. I will keep using Mennen Electric Shaver Pre-Shave until I can&#x27;t find it anymore. Hopefully, enough people will see this and maybe Mennen will start making it again. Let Mennen know your needs. That is the only way that they might start making it again. No, I don&#x27;t own any stock in Mennen or anything else. I&#x27;m just the typical man who wants a comfortable shave and I want the blades in my electric shaver to last longer. By the way, don&#x27;t rinse your razer heads and blades with water. If your water is hard water, this also coats the blades and reduces their life. Just use the little brush that comes with the razer to remove the cut hair.  Jim A.</li>
    <li> This is the most horrible smelling stuff I have ever slapped on my face. I tried 3 times and it didn&#x27;t get any better, so I chucked it. I do heartily recommend Williams Lectric Shave, which smells very nice and to me is much more effective than the Afta. Go ahead and try the Afta if you want, but don&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t warn you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK, but I prefer Skin Bracer. Plus, these are travel sizes.</li>
    <li> The wrong product (after shave) &amp; gave me a full credit. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s serviceable after shave but I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> facial hair stands up for a good close shave</li>
    <li> any one who uses pre electric shave. it is the best pre electric shave i have ever bought for my husband.</li>
    <li> I expect a pre-shave lotion to do two things: First, and most important, it has to permit the shaver to glide smoothly over the face. I use a Norelco rotary shaver and have years of experience with pre-shave lotions. This one is poor. It dries up too fast and then the shaver almost sticks to your face. You are almost better off just washing your face with clean water and drying it. Also, it comes out as a viscous paste, not as a liquid, and I don&#x27;t particularly like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it has to raise the follicles so the shaver can cut off the hair close to the skin leaving it smooth. It does a mediocre job of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I bought a six-pack. Will probably discard the other five and go back to Williams Pre-electric. It is MUCH better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using powder stick forever and finally tried this and WOW! Probably the first time I got a truly close shave like a blade. I use the Panasonic ARC 4 which is great and finally adding this was the key. Wash your face with water first and dry then just use about a bean size amount of Afta and equally apply to the facial shaving area. Let dry and then get ready for a tight shave. It also was a bit faster shave too I think. I just put a new screen on so it hasn&#x27;t been broken in to glide completely freely but gave an excellent shave. Almost look forward shaving again, haha.</li>
    <li> My favorite for many years and I cannot find it in any stores.</li>
    <li> The best for sensitive skin and it gives the closest shave with my Braun 7 series razor. Some don&#x27;t like the scent so just hop in the shower after shaving and the scent is washed away. I have purchased about 5 expensive pre electric  products and none of them stands up to Afta. Don&#x27;t waste you money on the so called fancy and expensive products.</li>
    <li> Like the product  very much</li>
    <li> So convenient to use and is very effective.  I was tired of spilling Lectric Shave while using it.  I think a gel such as Mennam Afta Pre-Shave has a huge advantage over a liquid. By far the best Pre-Shave available.</li>
    <li> This was not what I expected, but it&#x27;s certainly better than Lectricshave, the only product I find in local drugstores. . I remembered Mennen Afta afrom years ago as a  lime-scented liquid, though lime may have been only one of several varieties. This is a neutral-smelling gel. It spreads  easily, soaks into the whiskers, dries quickly and produces a smooth shave. When I tap the shaver on the edge of the sink to clean it, it leaves more shavings  than  with Lectricshave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different lotions. From different vendors, cheap and expensive ones. Nothing works for me like Mennen Afta Pre-electric Shave Lotion Original. My wife, on the other hand, absolutely hates the very distinct smell of this product. I, personally, do not care, as long as it works for me. And it works.</li>
    <li> Afta pre-electric is areat product but not always readily available in stores.  Purchasing in volume on line is an easy way to obtain the product for those who use it and can&#x27;t easily find it in retail outlets</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.  Fast shipping,,,,,thnx.</li>
    <li> items were as advertised shipping was ok</li>
    <li> My electric shaver now glides over my face.  Much better shave.</li>
    <li> The product works fine and price was good. However, like some other reviews stated, the smell is not desirable. I had to wash my face and neck three times to get fragrance off. For the first few minutes the old barber shop smell is ok, but that smell can be strong all day unless you wash it off. If the product were fragrance free I&#x27;d probably give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Used it for years and always happy with it.  Gel form is superior to the liquid.&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed that it is no longer available in stores.  I recommend this&lt;br /&gt;product to anyone that uses an electric razor.</li>
    <li> Great price. Saves face and extends shaver use.This has been a staple for years. Makes shaving a gentler experience.  Extends electric shave use.</li>
    <li> In absence of  any other reasonably priced product, one has no choice.</li>
    <li> I purchased the pre-shave for a cousin who lives in Poland.  Apparently it&#x27;s not available where he lives in Lomza.  He absolutely loves the AFTA pre-shave. I spoke with him after it was received and he let me know how good it works, and it smells good.</li>
    <li> This is the only pre-shave out there that turns your beard into almost dust instead of wet clumps of beard . You can easily clean out your shaver using Afta instead of any other pre-shave.</li>
    <li> everything delivered as promised &amp; advertised no surprises if and or butt just old fashioned down home serv as expected</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and like it a lot. It keeps the skin on my neck from getting irritated when I shave closely. I hope they never stop making it!</li>
    <li> I forgot about the cheap smelling scent of this product. While it does a nice job conditioning your face post-shave, the scent stays with you for the day which is like a dime store after-shave. If they come out with a non-scented product, let us know!</li>
    <li> Best pre-shave I have ever used - wait for it to dry!</li>
    <li> It actually smells much better than others. Seems to work better too not as much irritation. No overpowering odor (stench in some cases) this stuff does the job and I don&#x27; need a gas mask to use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used AFTA pre-electric shave lotion for years. I have always liked the way it works - just as advertised. Since I can&#x27;t find it in any stores anymore I&#x27;m glad it was available on Amazon. I&#x27;ll keep using it as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> Have been using Afta Preshave for many years, but it gradually disappeared from store shelves. Delighted to find it here. It really makes an electric shave more comfortable regardless of the shaver brand. Pack of 6 is a bit more than I can use, but will eventually use it up.  Last 6 pack lasted well over a year.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The product works much better than Williams Lectric Shave (WLS). It has less choking from the alcohol than WLS when applied and seems to stand the whiskers up better for a better shave. The Afta product is a lotion and is very easy to apply; no slopping all over. The Afta product will dry out your skin. I recommend washing your face after shaving and applying the Afta After Shave. Both a great smell that my wife likes.</li>
    <li> Yet again, after failing to find this in the local stores where I used to buy it for my husband,&lt;br /&gt;I went online and, of course, amazon had what I was looking for.  My personal shopping rule&lt;br /&gt;is that I will move an item to three consecutive shopping lists; but, when I can&#x27;t locate it locally,&lt;br /&gt;I head for online shopping.  Nine times out of ten it&#x27;s available through amazon.  Thank you, Amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years.  Local stores seem to stock shave products that smell alot and not work well to ease the shave.  Glad that Amazon has it available.</li>
    <li> I received it on time and it was what I wanted</li>
    <li> Huge difference when using this product.  Don&#x27;t need much to make shaving a lot more enjoyable with much less irritation.</li>
    <li> Really prepares your face for shaving so that there is minimal irratation. Wife loves the smell. Difficult to find anymore.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says but doesn&#x27;t dry out my face like other similar products. If you&#x27;ve got sensitive skin and get razor burn sometimes from your electric razor yet want a close shave this stuff works.</li>
    <li> I could not  find this product in  any store reason being Look at the (After shave lotion Bottle) it looks almost the  same So when who ever  order&#x27;s  product is not seeing  the closeness  So I go to the factory as the would say and buy a case at a time Cause I looke in many stores only to see it not on shelves maybe someone will see this review  and fix it</li>
    <li> My store was out of my regular Williams Lectric Shave, so I had to buy Mennen&#x27;s Pre Shave. I threw the left over portion in the garbage when I purchased my Williams Lectric Shave, after my store had it in stock. The pre shave that Mennen&#x27;s have is not good.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, it softens the hair follicles for a better shave.</li>
    <li> Works well with my Braun Series 7 shaver.</li>
    <li> Who would have thought that this great pre-shave would turn up on Amazon?  The last time I saw this was in a discount health &amp; beauty aids store several years ago.  I grabbed up as many as I could.  This kept me clean shaven for a few years; but time has a way of moving on and I&#x27;ve been out of the stuff for some time.  Magically it appeared in an Amazon email and I jumped at the chance to get some.&lt;br /&gt;The product does not disappoint.  I&#x27;m guaranteed a smooth, easy shave every time.  This is clearly the best pre shave lotion invented by the mind of mankind.  I just don&#x27;t understand why the product is not in general distribution, but as long as I can get it on Amazon, I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
    <li> Great service from you guys, great product from Mennen.</li>
    <li> Works great. Better than the very popular oil/alcohol types and clones...at least with my face and light beard. Not crazy about the fragrance, but I don&#x27;t find it a problem. I love the fragrance of the after shave lotion which I love and have used for years.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon. Can&#x27;t find either one locally for at least a year.</li>
    <li> Husband can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore.  He LOVES this and we&#x27;ll keep ordering from Amazon.  He says product produces no irritation from electric shaving.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite but is hard to find.  It works well and is half the price of most similar products.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> Have to say that AMAZON was super fast in reimbursing.&lt;br /&gt;Pre-shave is super good product. I use it for two years, very good and useful. Electric shaving became a fun thing to do with this! much less irritation on neck...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, some idiot labeled After shave Conditioner as Pre-Electric shave lotion!&lt;br /&gt;Me and my friend now have 6 units each of after shave conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, Amazon was very fast on reimbursing money.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for many years, excellent results, provides a easy shave.  Also easy to carry in car when traveling.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and is the only non-greasy pre-electric shave lotion that I have found.  I am very satisfied with this product and hope it is not discontinued.  For some reason unknown to me, retail stores have stopped carrying this product.  Also, apparently the manufacturer has stopped making the &amp;#34;Fresh Scent&amp;#34; version of the product.</li>
    <li> I have used Afta pre-electric shave for many years.  It is the only product my skin can tolerate.  Everything else  causes my skin to break out.  Try it it is great</li>
    <li> The best product out there for electric shaver users. No skin irritation, smooth shave...every time.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years now but for some reason the local stores quit carrying it. Nothing else seems to work quite as well for me. When I found it here I was very happy.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because it is an excellent product, it is a pity that Colgate-Palmolive are no longer producing it.  If they were I would be pleased to recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Was unable to get locally and this was advertised as pre-shave lotion but all six units was after-shave lotion and unable to return so gave them away,</li>
    <li> As a pre-electric shave there are not a lot of products available, used to be stocked by Walmart but could no longer find it so I turned to the Amazon web and one of their subs offered free shipping and a decent cost for a siz pack that will probably last well over a year. Does not pack a lot of strong scent and just preps the skin perfectly for a shave</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Afta Pre-Electric for years. It lubricates my face better than other pre-shave products and doesn&#x27;t irritate my face.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this pre-shave and it is almost impossible to find in any of our local stores so this is a great deal. The six  bottles last about a year and then its easy to reorder.</li>
    <li> i use this product all the time. i could not get it locally and hence ordered online. It works great for me. i am quite satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Works great and easy to shave with this product.  It is hard to find in the store and with the ease of ordering it through Amazon was even better.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to. I alternate a variety of products for several reasons.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many, many years; but it&#x27;s become difficult to find in local markets, so I was happy to find it online. It&#x27;s the only product I use for pre shave; great product!</li>
    <li> price was vwery good and shipping quick</li>
    <li> The best pre-shave product I have found/used.</li>
    <li> I prefer this over Lectricshave. It&#x27;s easier to spread on without dripping all over. You also get a closer shave.</li>
    <li> Gives a smooth closer shave.</li>
    <li> Get used to this stuff helping you shave, going back to not using it is really hard on the face. Even with an electric razor... shocking.</li>
    <li> We like this and it is hard to find in the stores.</li>
    <li> Far superior to any other product in keeping your face free of abrasions and/or little cuts.</li>
    <li> Best on the market. Great scent too. Leaves the skin soft, sets wiskers up for easy shaving. Great all around product.</li>
    <li> This is a product my husband adores.  It gives him a great shave and the scent is manly but not flowerly.  I was so happy to find it and he was pleased with my &amp;#34;surprise&amp;#34;.  He likes the lotion as opposed to the oily preshaves and this does the job.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  It&#x27;s disappeared locally and was very happy to find it at Amazon.  The price is great and works better than the replacement skin conditioners or face washes now on the shelves.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. I like it and do not like any other products to supposedly the same thing.</li>
    <li> Most pre-electric &amp;#34;lotions&amp;#34; are liquid. this is a thick cream. It should be labeled has cream. Or I should read more closely.</li>
    <li> I can not see that it helps any better than a dry shave with the shaver I use. My wife agrees and that settles that.</li>
    <li> I have used this for quite some time and really like it. I was happy to find it on Amazon. I would recommend it to all electric shaver users.</li>
    <li> Really good for your skin. If you are not careful, it will run off your hand before you get it to your face, which would be a shame because it leaves your face very smooth after the shave...</li>
    <li> my husbands favorite.</li>
    <li> I purchased A package of Afta Pre Electric Shave Lotion from Mr. Medical. It arrived I opened it. The bottles were original and shrink wrapped in plastic. the problem is the lotion in the bottle was not the real deal, it a white lotion that was 90% alcohol and smelled awful. These people purposely refilled these bottles and sold them beware they are thieves</li>
    <li> One of the few pre-electric shave lotions available any more that is not oily. My husband really gets a good close shave without skin irritation. So glad we can get it now through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I used to be able to get this at Wal Mart but the one by me stopped carrying it. I like the thicker lotion of this product rather than the liquid of the others. I wish it was unscented but you can&#x27;t have everything.</li>
    <li> Great service, great price.</li>
    <li> All is good... product is as ordered and expected.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this pre-electric shave for many years.  Since he isn&#x27;t happy with any other product, we&#x27;ve done a lot of searching as the Mennen Afta Pre-electric Shave Lotion disappears from the stores.  I told my husband to check on Amazon and there it was.  He says he bought enough to last the rest of his life.</li>
    <li> The product is everything that I expected from Mennen.</li>
</ol>
