<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smell is great but product itself didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to preface this by saying I rarely give reviews because unfortunately-- I am rarely impressed with most health and beauty products. This soap however has given me clear skin for the first time in 3 years. I had really good skin as a teenager and 3 years ago developed adult acne. I think it could possibly be hormonal although my mother has struggled with cystic acne as well. Within that time is got progressively worse and every product I tried didn&#x27;t do much at all. To the point-- this soap is made of natural ingredients (I&#x27;d eat it) and it has HELPED. It took a while, maybe two months of washing 1-2 times a day.Today my face is CLEAR. Like throw on some mineral powder, mascara and out the door clear. As for lightening, it&#x27;s a bit lighter I&#x27;m pretty light-skinned to begin with so the difference isn&#x27;t that noticeable but I just wanted my acne gone. My back is also smoother and my butt acne is gone. I am impressed and buying another bar. The only thing is I still have large pores and blackheads in my T-zone but I think I&#x27;ll try a charcoal mask every week to help with that.</li>
    <li> My face is finally looking clear and it makes me look younger.</li>
    <li> Best. Product. Ever. Period!  Planning to buy again! :-)</li>
    <li> great soap to briten your complexion!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any real benefits of using this over a regular exfoliating soap. It does not smell very good and just made my skin feel tight. Plus, you lose so much of this expensive soap every time is touches water so it doesn&#x27;t last long either.</li>
    <li> effective it makes my face whiter now</li>
    <li> Besides of peeling off my face every use, it didn&#x27;t help on vBulletin anything....</li>
    <li> Does not work at all! I have been using this soap for about a month, its just leaves my skin dry. This has not helped even my skin tone at all, such a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Works great! Can see positive results after a few weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Took about a month before I saw results but I did see results and thats all that matters. I&#x27;d advise anyone interested to definitely follow the instructions for using Kojic soaps. I do not believe this soap is for bleaching skin, it simply evened out my skin tone. Don&#x27;t use it excessively cause then you&#x27;ll run out (Lol). It shrunk my pores and got rid of some acne scars that I had too. I paired it with the Olay facial scrub cloths too as an extra exfoliation method. I&#x27;d use it before to clean my face and then I&#x27;d use the soap maybe 2 minutes later and leave it on for about 20 seconds. Do whatever works for you though. And realllllyyyy moisturize, but use a deep moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t irritate. Maybe something Aloe based.</li>
    <li> This soap worked superbly.  I used it on my knees, neck, and elbows.  It took about 3 weeks before  I noticed  a significant  difference. I am African-American with Olive skin tone.  I had very, very dark knees.  My skin is very smooth and even.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I will definitely purchase it again as well as other products!</li>
    <li> Smells nice.  A bit pricey tho.</li>
    <li> This is the best soap I have used for acne scars and blemishes. I have spent thousand of dollars on some of the best products listed but nothing comes close to this soap. I&#x27;m definitely going to continue using this soap along with other products sold by this company.</li>
    <li> regular soap i think doesnt make u lighter, tried it 3 days.</li>
    <li> Received it at the expected delivery date. I&#x27;ve been using the soap but honestly i have not notice anything.</li>
    <li> This soap is very powerful. Way more than Kojie San&#x27;s kojic acid soap. I have used this for only a few days and noticed my skin peeling right away. It could be also the fact that I am using retin a. I did notice a lot of lightening on my face as usual with kojic acid soaps but way more faster with this brand. I am waiting on two bars I recently order to be shipped to me hopefully tomorrow or Friday!</li>
    <li> Okay so let me start by saying I was first using Dr. Fred&#x27;s summit whitening cream for my embarrassingly dark underarms. It gave me almost no results. In desperation I googled skin whitening soap. After some research I decided to buy this soap and im so HAPPY I did! I used it and got visibly noticeable results within the first 2-3 weeks. The directions say to keep it on for a few seconds. My skin is not the sensitive type and after reading an article online from this one lady who had a lot of experience with Kojic soaps said she left hers on for 5-10 mins. So I started leaving it on for 10 mins and rinsing with cold water. Within a week I was confident enough to wear tank tops again! Dark underarms will never be an issue again. Just remember to use a good moisturizer! (I use coconut oil)</li>
    <li> I really like this soap. I have super sensitive skin and it really hasn&#x27;t bothered me much at all. I did have a small breakout which was expected but it hasn&#x27;t even been a month and other people are starting to see a difference in my complexion. I will be buying more, love love love this !</li>
    <li> Clear when you wash your face then goes back to the same again .. Not the best purchase no significant long term improvement been using it 3 weeks now</li>
    <li> The value you&#x27;ll get out of this product all depends on what you&#x27;re looking for it to accomplish.  If you&#x27;re looking to clear up breakouts, this works well, especially so for oily skin.  If you&#x27;re looking to lighten your skin, I strongly suggest using this soap with a bleaching cream (personally recommend Piona) in order to achieve faster results. Used by itself, the lightening effects take a while to kick in. It does works great as an exfoliator, which is essential to skin lightening.    Also, don&#x27;t be scared to leave the soap on your face for longer than the recommended time. (you have to know your skin and what it can handle though) I&#x27;ve found that I can leave the soap on for about 5 mins without any discomfort. Allows for deeper penetration and exfoliation.    It does thin the skin and causes a feeling of tightness in the face so again, it&#x27;s a good idea to use it with a cream</li>
    <li> It definitely works. I see the improvement in my overall complexion.</li>
    <li> I absolutely Love love love this product. I have given a bar to several of my friends and they are hooked also. Pair this with the tinkle (shaver) and see amazing results is your skin. Use the tinkle to dermaplane your face once a week to exfoliate and use this Kojic acid soap twice daily.</li>
    <li> Combined this with the cream. Very disappointed,  saw absolutely zero results.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me..</li>
    <li> its been 3 weeks now since using this product I&#x27;m still waiting for the results that the product as promised</li>
    <li> I have a sensitive skin and it burns my skin</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd time buying this product. I just reordered before writing this, I am officially hooked! I started off using it for my arms and inner thigh/buttocks area, but now I use it on my face and neck. It is a difference than before because its a natural glow that I have, smooth skin, less pimples, and the marks on my face is gradually fading. I now exfoliate more which has helped me so much with having healthy skin. I got this mainly to get rid of dark spots and it has done just that but it doesn&#x27;t happen overnight!! I purchased my first bar of this soap in august and I can see a huge difference from over a few months. I also have KP on my arms which has helped with some of the scars I had on my arms.I have a little ways to go but I can definitely tell that its working. Also, a little GOES ALONG LONG WAY! i STILL WASH MY FACE TWICE A DAY AND USE A FACE/BODY SCRUB ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK. My skin didn&#x27;t peel but I make sure to moisturize after washing my face. Hoped I helped.</li>
    <li> The soap does whiten but when I stopped using it. The soap does work well, but It caused irritation and darkening of my skin when I discontinued use. You can&#x27;t stop using it to continue to get the benefits of the soap. That is why I gave it four stars and not five.</li>
    <li> I just got my soap and this was the fastest shipping I have ever had, AWESOME! I really hope this helps my dark knees and discoloration. I&#x27;m considered &amp;#34;light skinned&amp;#34; but everything shows on my skin and I hope it helps improve it. I used it tonight and I like it all ready, thank you for the fast shipping! I got in in 4 days! CRAZY FAST!</li>
    <li> This soap works well, it&#x27;s a wonderful product! I would purchased again....soon :)....i would definitely recommend this product to anyone interested.</li>
    <li> I received a sample size of this product and after using it for 2 weeks, I knew I found the soap that works for my skin type. I have combination-type skin with acne marks and uneven tone. After using this whitening soap for approximately 2 weeks, I noticed a significant result in regards to my overall skin texture and complexity. It&#x27;s a little expensive for a bar of soap but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 27 with hyperpigmentation. It&#x27;s worse on my face which is why I bought this soap. My face is a different color from the rest of my body and it shows in pictures, which I get embarrassed by. This is why I bought this product,  to try and lighten my face to match the rest of me. It tightened my skin :) The line that I had forming inbetween my eyebrows went away. But this is just a temporary affect due to how dry it makes your skin. It leaves your face feeling tight. But carrot oil or anything good moisturizer will help with the tightness. I haven&#x27;t seen any lightening results from the soap though. And I&#x27;m using sunscreen spf 50.</li>
    <li> Great for your skin and I love it. Works well especially on blemishes.</li>
    <li> By far, hands down, my favorite skin lightening soap! It works extremely well and within 3 weeks. I&#x27;ve used it all over my body with good results. It does take a while to get to California though.</li>
    <li> Great product. You see results right away!</li>
    <li> My first Time using this soap and it seems to be working slowly but surely ! I will most definitely be buying it again !</li>
    <li> Works good.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my son&#x27;s knees and elbows, don&#x27;t see a big difference yet and it&#x27;s the 3rd one we buy.  We try using consistently, although not everyday.  Using it with the lotion as well.</li>
    <li> Before I start I NEVER GIVE 5 STARS...NEVER and I gave 2 products 5 stars today. I&#x27;m just so happy with my last order of products. I&#x27;ve tried most of the soaps on the market and I finally found one that works and WORKS FAST. There&#x27;s really nothing to rant about other than it lightens your skin and the smell is very nice. I wish I would have just ordered this 1st. I&#x27;ve been using this for 1 mth only and I&#x27;m a whole shade lighter already. I had to slow down because I don&#x27;t want to get too light. Great soap. This is the only soap i&#x27;ll ever use again</li>
    <li> Best soap ever! It works so well i love it. Will be back to buy some again soon.!!!!! Thank you</li>
    <li> This soap came with the kit that I purchased for my inner thigh area. Aside from showing significant lightening effect, I also noticed that my razor bumps are almost gone. I started using it on the rest of my body and I swear that this soap helped my skin a lot. I also have bacne scars that lightened up after using this on that area. This soap only lasts for 2-3 weeks if you use it twice a day on your whole face and body. The size is ok for the price but be prepared to use 2 soaps a month if you want to lighten up your whole body.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I purchased this kojic soap. I ordered it before from another website which costs a little bit more compared here on Amazon. There are pros and cons using this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt;1. It works. The soap does what it says: it lightens your skin and you can see the difference within a few weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;2. It removes acne marks or pimple scars.&lt;br /&gt;3. Great for removing dark spots. I use this on my underarms as well together with the whitening creme and it works like magic. It took maybe 4 weeks before I started seeing results though.&lt;br /&gt;4. It makes my skin soft and smooth and it feels like it brightened up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s quite expensive compared to other kojic soaps.&lt;br /&gt;2. It stings when you first use it and it makes the skin look a little reddish especially if you have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;3. You have to  use a lot of mosturizer or else it will make your skin itch like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this soap. I&#x27;ve tried many brands and this so far has exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> The four stars are for the Kojic acid soap not for the seller or the fact that I paid for 1 day shipping and recieved it in about 3 days! Besides that so far so good. I&#x27;ve noticed my overall complexion becoming even-toned after years of hyper pigmentation and discoloration. Also I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is smoother and has a healthy glow. DO NOT OVER USE!! This will cause serious irration and probably more breakouts. I have extremely oily acne prone skin and when I use a heavy moisturizer in conjunction with this soap my skin sucks it right up! That&#x27;s how drying it can be! When you wash your face only leave the soap on for about 1-2 mintues any longer will cause burning. I&#x27;m also using mother of a pearl soap with this. I had very stubborn hormonal acne that&#x27;s beginning to clear up within a week of use. I&#x27;m just hoping it eventually clears all the dark spots on my face from years of acne. Fingers crossed!</li>
    <li> I am happy I tried this soap. Since using this soap my dark spots are going away and my skin lighter. Not sure if I will order it again anytime soon, because this soap cost to much with shipping and handling.</li>
    <li> This soap is amazing.  Before using, you need to read every single word of the instructions above.....especially all the cautions.  This soap works, but it&#x27;s also very freaking strong.  If you use it correctly, it is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m mainly using on my face and arms/hands.  Right now, I leave it on no more than about 10 seconds and then I wash it off.  Use a lot of moisturizer afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 50 years old, so I&#x27;m really trying to get rid of age spots.  It takes time, but this soap makes my skin so soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you protect your skin with sun screen after using this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason I wanted to use Kojic acid is because I read an article about people in Japan who worked in a rice factory.  They started noticing that all the workers had really beautiful hands and arms......and they realized it was being caused by the kojic acid in the rice.  After that, i&#x27;ve been in search of a kojic acid product that would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, and I&#x27;ll be buying more of this!</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Must use moisturizer after use or you will experience a lot of dryness!!</li>
    <li> This soap is amazing! I saw results within two weeks of use. However, I do have sensitive skin and cannot leave this one for more than 10 seconds. Nonetheless, I am seeing results.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my face feel . No side effects except for smoothness</li>
    <li> You will see the value of your money. It works on my skin:)</li>
    <li> Hmmm havent finished the bar yet to really say if its really working but I do see a difference in the color of my dark spots. Ill write another review when I finsh the whole bar.</li>
    <li> When this soap arrived, I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it because of the glowing reviews. Well it&#x27;s been two full weeks, and I don&#x27;t see any results. I don&#x27;t even feel any stinging on my skin, and I have left it on for 30 seconds or more. I&#x27;ll keep using it in hopes that it&#x27;s just taking more time to lighten my dark spots. At least it smells nice.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for 3 weeks. I have light brown skin and suffer from hyperpigmentation. when i first used it it tingled, then itched, and if it gets towards your sensitive areas it will burn like a mf. I use it on my face, inner thighs, pubic area, buttocks, and sometimes legs. Do not leave it on for too long or it will feel uncomfortable. I got used to it. I use it like 5 times a week with the moisterizer. I do see some results but no dramatic results yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for several weeks now with no change.. Pretty disappointed</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this soap from my aunt and I&#x27;ve been using it on my body for about two and a half months now. I have keratosis pilaris and this soap has helped smoothen my skin. It has helped fade some of my scars as well. The size is decent but this is very costly for a bar of soap. The smell is awesome and it smells like oranges. Overall, I like this soap but wish that the price is cheaper.</li>
    <li> I have one arm that&#x27;s 3 shades darker than the other. It doesn&#x27;t lighten that much. Maybe it lightened one shade after like 6 months. I might be biased though</li>
    <li> Took a couple weeks to start seeing a slight difference, but overall it is making a difference.  I don&#x27;t love the smell, but that&#x27;s just a personal preference. :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for a week and already see amazing results. This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever wrote a review about a product and I&#x27;m a beauty product junkie. If you follow the directions completely and stay committed, you will see results! Although I do use Marie France tone perfecting cream with it. I&#x27;m 23 and have an olive skin tone so I&#x27;ve struggled with dark circles under my eyes and small&lt;br /&gt;dark spots since high school. This past year I started getting cystic acne that left severe acne scars. I started using more and more makeup to cover it up and before I knew it I had destroyed my skin. My acne scars have lightened incredibly and cleared up my acne almost overnight. The dark circles under my eyes are already lightening. My skin is bright, smooth, and soft.</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t lighten my skin at all. and it also Made my skin very dry that it hurt even when I moved.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work like I wanted</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this soap did not work for me. I wanted to clear up the ashy appearance of my elbows, but this soap did nothing for them. It also made them very dry, even with moisturizer. I won&#x27;t be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> product does what it says. I started using it in my bikini area, within a week i saw results. I was a little skeptical about using this product, but I am glad I bought it. Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Great product, works as described</li>
    <li> Wonderful product really lightened spots on face after a week of use. Recommend highly.</li>
    <li> This inexpensive product has far exceeded my expectations!!  I have struggled with Actinic Keratosis (skin rash/sun damage) on my arms for nearly 10 years unsuccessfully with topical steroids and harsh chemical peels. Please be advised, this product did not &#x27;cure&#x27; or &#x27;eliminate&#x27; the blotches however using this product from day one has reduced the redness, but more noticeably yielded a smoother appearance which has helped my self-confidence. I will definitely continue to use this product!!!</li>
    <li> Smells good and i like the way my skin feels</li>
    <li> I like this product but I feel my sugar scrub achieves the same goal.</li>
    <li> Been using for almost a month and see light results</li>
    <li> I gave 3 stars because it has lightened my problem area a bit. Ive only used one bar with the combination of shea butter to moisturize and I have seen some improvement. I will continue to use this product because it seems to be lightening my problem area just maybe not as fast as I thought it would. Also Ive only used this product once a day for about a month . Hope this helped!</li>
    <li> THIS SOAP IS EVERYTHING. I HAD A LOT OF HYPERPIGMATATION. AND IT IS CLEARING IT OUT ON MY FACE. MY SKIN IS SO MUCH BRIGHTER. AND IT CLEARED ABOUT 50% OF THE MARKS IN 1 MONTH. I STARTED. USI.G IT ON 5/4/15 AND ITS THE 30TH OF MAY. AND I SEE THE RESULTS . I PURCHASED TWO BARS AND YESTERDAY I JUST OPENED THE OTHER PACK. SO IT LAST A LONG TIME. AND IT WORKS. MY SKIN COMPLEXION IS CLOSE TO KERRI WASHINGTON.  SO EVERY MARK WAS VISIBLE. NOW I USE JUST A BB FROM BLACK RADIANCE AND IM OUT. THANKS MARIE FRANCE.</li>
    <li> This has been the best product I have bought so far. I use it to wash my face in the morning and night. It hasn&#x27;t lightened my skin but it has definitely helped to clear up my adult acne. My face is smoother than it&#x27;s ever been. I use it with rosehip oil (just a lil!). It does dry out your skin and burn slighty when you first apply it. It&#x27;s nothing painful. If you keep it on your skin too long I&#x27;m sure it will burn badly. You will know when to wash it off but personally I wouldn&#x27;t recommend keeping it on longer than a minute.</li>
    <li> I Love this soap, a little  costly but just as Good a &amp;#34;Funky Mama&amp;#34; ...My skin is CLEAR and flawless !!!</li>
    <li> Worked and I love it. Nothing happens over night but just give it a few days and you will see results</li>
    <li> I am a aesthetician and I love this.  See the results in one week.</li>
    <li> It was alright not as strong as &amp;#34;kojii san&amp;#34; kojic acid soap... But it does last longer ordered two bars and im now just getting to my 2nd bar.</li>
    <li> Actually really good. Dont focus on the reaults at first because it would seem like its taking longer but it&#x27;s actually really really good. I&#x27;m medium brown and I&#x27;ve gotten lighter. My friends noticed and it works great for acne too. Its expensive but trust me, its worth it 100%</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s works well, I think. I don&#x27;t use it that frequently the soap is super strong and dries out my skin bad. I have to like buy body oil for when I use it, just stick to the instructions and warnings. It is very strong chemicals and lotion doesn&#x27;t hydrate we&#x27;ll, stick to body oil.</li>
    <li> Ordered product twice. Didn&#x27;t see any major differences. I have moderate acne. Irritated it more. Used on body as well. Very drying.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing they say its a 8-12 week process but i saw results within 2 weeks. Even my friends noticed, I&#x27;ve tried every creame and soap out there. And this one takes the cake. TRY IT!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m being patient but not sure how long it takes before I&#x27;m able to see any results</li>
    <li> This soap works very fast my co worker noticed results within a week</li>
    <li> does absolutely nothing..i bought a few products from this line with really high hopes..and months later still no results</li>
    <li> A good product but you have to be consistent in order to reap the benefits and alot of moisturize and sunblock</li>
    <li> Excellent soap I use regularly  to clean face.</li>
    <li> My skin has not lighten so far.  Kind of disappointed.  However, I contacted seller to see if I could buy more bars without paying $4.99 per bar shipping cost. They suggested I buy six more.  When I agreed, they offered to reduce $1.00 off the $30.00 shipping cost of buying six bars. They offered to charge me $65.98 + $4.99 shipping for six bars.  They should have just stated they would not reduce shipping charge for purchasing multiple bars! Not a upfront exchange.  Not happy with company policies, but will update later if I see results after buying two more bars.</li>
    <li> Product do not work at all</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Skin is healthier.</li>
    <li> This soap does work. The results are gradual but I&#x27;m starting to notice a difference in my skin complexion. My face is starting to clear up after weeks of use. It is effective to clear up blemishes. I just wish I knew about this soap earlier instead of wasting so much money in the past on doctor&#x27;s prescibed products that didn&#x27;t even work. I tired using natural products like raw organic honey, cinnamon, turmeric, and lemon juice. The only effective one was the raw organic honey. It made my skin really soft in the morning. I applied it every night. But now I apply it every other night b/c of its stickiness. Eventually, I got used to stickiness. The lemon juice burned the side of my face near my eyes. It is really strong. The cinnamon wasn&#x27;t as effective as I wanted it to be. The turmeric gave me a glow but it stained clothes. With these soaps, I learned to cut the bar in half to save some. The bar is very thick so if you cut it in pieces it lasts longer. I&#x27;m definately going to keep buying this soap to use all over my body in the summer. When I shower, I noticed soaps tend to run out faster. After taking off my makeup, I cleanse my face with the Ambi cocoa butter bar. It smells soo good. I would give the soap 5 stars but it didn&#x27;t work as fast as I wanted it to. I seen results maybe after 3 weeks to a month of usage. Honestly if you really want clear skin, there is going to be alot of trial and error. Patience is annoying but it&#x27;s key.</li>
    <li> this soap turned my skin red and it made my body look like I had hives I didn&#x27;t leave it on more then the recommended time but it still made my skin look really bad if anything I would say that this soap isn&#x27;t for people with darker skin. and I left it in the shower and it melted....</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a change in my sun spots. Although must admit used it 3-4 times a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in LOVE with this soap! I used to have  a medium/dark complexion with a huge dark spot from a burn on my stomach.Ive noticed a improvement during the first week of use! This product is as it claims professional strength so used as directed, you don&#x27;t want to burn yourself :) this makes me WHOLE body appear more attractive and vibrant. I&#x27;m very thank full I don&#x27;t have to look at the many little dark spots that our also on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;When Combined with light exfoliating, you will get the maximum results! The skin will look way healthier and will clear faster. I would also recommend using with their other products to also help increase the efficiency of this soap.&lt;br /&gt;Though it is small, I have not noticed shrinkage like most other brands get after the first or second use. The soap still looks like how it came and I&#x27;m excited to see the rest of my results.&lt;br /&gt;My advice to you is to buy this soap! Use it constantly! And exfoliate! I recommend this to everyone who wants perfect skin. This is definitley no to be taken lightly by people using it. It&#x27;s good for a lot of skin issues and I love everything about it!</li>
    <li> Nice and fragrant soap. I&#x27;ve used only one bar didn&#x27;t see much of a difference. Wouldn&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> I saw no change in my facial problems.</li>
    <li> I have been using the peoduct for about three weeks, but I. Am still waiting to see some kind of change in my skin. But I am hopeful.</li>
    <li> No noticeable results.</li>
    <li> Have been using this soap consistently (morning/night) for about 4 months. Little to no results. Very drying (but all exfoliating soaps are drying), makes skin sensitive if you leave it on too long, it helps a little with acne which is why I gave it 3 stars, but is on the more expensive side for lightening soaps. (Almost $13 w/ s&amp;h for ONE bar and I&#x27;ve bought 3 bars)&lt;br /&gt;I just bought Kojie San, and we&#x27;ll see if that gives me the results I want.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, the soap is too expensive for the lack of results. It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
    <li> Soap smell ok, but finish fast</li>
    <li> African American skin: Left this on for 20 minutes daily and had no change whatsoever, had to actually pay to return it.  Keep in mind the return window is smaller then that of the test window so more then likely you will not be able to return by the time you realize it&#x27;s not working.</li>
    <li> This really works, i can see the diference now in my face and underarms, and it smells really good!! I will buy this again</li>
    <li> I love this soap! I&#x27;m a medium brown complexion with combination skin and for some odd reason it likes to harbor dead skin layers. I had a lot on my cheeks, chin, acne scars, dislocation on my legs, underarms, chest, and stomach due to pregnancy. After my pregnancy my skin felt out of control, and the peels I had on my face to remove dark spots in the past burned like hell. I&#x27;ve been using this soap for 3 months with no problems. I have sensitive skin, and this soap does not bother me at all.  My baby is will be 4 months in a week, and my skin is starting to look better than when I was a teenager. My face is even toned, and the majority of the dark spots I had from pregnancy are gone. I&#x27;ve had dark inner thighs, and elbows since I was in my teens, and that is slowly going away. My skin looks brighter and healthy. It&#x27;s not lightening my skin, but restoring it which is what I&#x27;ve been looking for. People keep saying I kept my pregnancy glow who haven&#x27;t seen me in a while, but they don&#x27;t realize that I never had the glow while I was pregnant. The soap smells great, my skin is hydrated to where I&#x27;m noticing I am needing to use lotion less, and the price is cheaper than any beauty site with products that claim to do the same thing.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for the skin, very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Skin started peeling almost immediately.</li>
    <li> wonderful product...prompt delivery...excellent...i will most definitely order soon again.The soap is wonderful and works like a charm.My skin looks different already</li>
    <li> I have been using product for about 2 weeks and have seen a dramatic change in my skin. The dark spots due to acne have started to fade and the sun damage is also fading. I love this product and will definitely order it again!!!</li>
    <li> Just got mine in the mail package looks great and I&#x27;m hoping it works as great as everyone says.  I have acne been suffering from it for yrs now on and off, right now I&#x27;m goin thru a bad break out :(. I have acne scars for days :( and a few other areas that I need to be even-toned. Hoping I can come back and write a great review,  if I do you will know for sure it works bc I barely almost never literally write good reviews bc it always seem like nothing I try ever delivered real results. I wish me luck lol... update you guys in 4 weeks or so.</li>
    <li> Not working so far after 5-6 uses, maybe after a few months...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for a couple of weeks, once sometimes twice a day and I do notice a difference. I use this soap in conjunction with a fading cream, I first wash then spot treat the problem areas. Even old scars are fading, and my face looks great without foundation. My skin feels much softer, which was a pleasant surpise. I&#x27;ve heard kojic acid can have a drying effect, but I have not experienced this at all, actually the opposite, my skin feels moisturized once I leave the shower. To top it off the soap has a wonderful citrus smell. I&#x27;ll be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> Works well but I believe you have to use it in conjunction with the oil to get the full affect of the item.  If you need minimal bleaching done to level out your skintone then it should work well solo.  However, if you are like me and need some heavy leveling then use both the oil and then the soap.  Read directions carefully for the oil to avoid the occurrence of hyperpigamitation.</li>
    <li> This soap seems to be having a positive affect with brightening my skin, after one week I noticed a difference!</li>
    <li> Love love love that soap! It smells wonderful! Works very well and gives your skin a nice glow</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for a little over 2 weeks now and I am surprised at the results that I am already noticing!. I am one of those ppl that if I don&#x27;t see results the next day I just give up. I bought this soap to lighten some scars I had on my legs since childhood its is working fabulously. I am of dark brown complexion and started using it as well on my knees since I notice that they are a little darker than my legs and yup its evening out my legs better that what I expected.</li>
    <li> It is a strong a potent soap, but you would need to use it consistently and let it lather on your face and in conjunction with a lightening cream for results. If you have sensitive or dry skin, then this soap may not be for you if you plan to use it on your face. The acidity isn&#x27;t subtle and it will dry out your face, however with a moisturizer or even a lightening lotion those with oily skin should be fine. The soap gets runny if it&#x27;s under water, so I recommend not wetting the entire soap when you use it, and maybe just pulling the plastic down to the top of it so the soap doesn&#x27;t waste. There will be orange residue from the water making the soap soft and slipper, so make sure the soap is placed in a soap holder so your sink your bathroom sill won&#x27;t get messy. I have used Diana Stalder products, and I find this to be extremely comparable. I don&#x27;t give it give stars because I had tanned a lot a little less than a month ago, and I still have tan lines despite using this soap. The tan lines have gone down, and I haven&#x27;t exfoliated before putting the soap on the area or perhaps I haven&#x27;t let it lather ( on top of not using a whitening cream), but I&#x27;m sure if you&#x27;re consistent with this,l and use a lightening cream, you&#x27;ll have results. Just be wary if you have dry or sensitive skin because the irritation maybe break you out</li>
    <li> I use this for the dark areas between my thighs, as well as other areas prone to darken and occasionally for acne that may surface. Works great for both. This smells good too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dark skinned African and East Indian mix. I&#x27;ve used one bar of this soap that I bought here, I&#x27;m done with it, ordered another so I&#x27;m onto my 2nd, no results yet but I&#x27;m hoping for the best.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a couple of months now.  Works well at reducing brown spots on the face, especially in combination with organic Argan oil afterwards.</li>
    <li> This soap is really helping with my hyper-pigmentation... It&#x27;s sitting on my face right now.</li>
    <li> I love the size of the bars ... but they are abit pricey.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t finished the bar yet , but so far , no results....gonna continue using it but it would be a shame if I paid 12.99 for no change whatsoever. I&#x27;ll write another review in the next week or so ! :/</li>
    <li> I really really like this soap. I have had acne and oily skin for about 8 years now. I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of products to clear my skin and fade all the acne scars that I&#x27;ve accumulated. The very first time I used this soap, my skin felt great. This soap really cleans down deep leaving your skin very smooth and healthy. Within the very first week, my acne was completely gone and hasn&#x27;t come back. As for the lightening effect, it has taken 3 months of use to get about 3 shades lighter. I used to use foundations like &amp;#34;golden&amp;#34;, &amp;#34; tan&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;medium dark&amp;#34; but now I have to buy makeup like &amp;#34;beige&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;honey&amp;#34;. As for the dark scars left behind by acne, they&#x27;re almost completely gone. Hopefully soon I&#x27;ll be able to leave the house without makeup. I would definitely reccomend this soap to anyone who wants to get their acne under control and fade some scarring due to acne. The only cons I can think of are the price and the fact that the soap doesn&#x27;t last very long if you&#x27;re using it in the morning and at night before bed.</li>
    <li> I love this soap, it is for sure a process though. I used it on my face and buttocks, and I am brown skinned the spots on my face are going slowly but surely, I will buy more, remember just be patient with this product, works better after the peeling oil which I also used. ( Not on my face)</li>
    <li> i waited so long for this and it did nothing..ill go back to piona</li>
    <li> Excellent.i am black and have medium brown skin..my face overall was lighter in two weeks. Works pretty fast. DONT LEAVE ON FACE TO LONG OR IT CAN IRRITATE IT..staying out of the sun is important as well or wear makeup to protect your skin from the sun. Its great..been using it for a couple months now and im over 1 shade lighter..evened out my skin tone and vanished my acne blemishes..i dont use it everyday anymore, you dont need to unless your just starting to use it. For the first two weeks use it day and night. Then after that you can reduce it to once a day or once a week or once a month for maintenance.</li>
    <li> Bought this soap to try it out and damn it&#x27;s better dan any kojic soap I ever used. The trick is letting it sit on your skin a while before washing it off. It&#x27;s a must have</li>
    <li> Loved this soap! It works and smell amazing!</li>
    <li> adjust your prices both for shipping and the product! the soap works</li>
</ol>
