<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wow - this case fits very nice with no loose feel.  All the cut outs are positioned correctly and there is no moulding flash anywhere.  I like that the power button and volume are also covered by a moulded protective layer to keep dust from entering and eventually getting caught behind the screen.  Very nice and I will buy another one for my Galaxy Player 5.0!</li>
    <li> Fits the [[ASIN:B005P1VMLU Samsung Galaxy 4.0 Android MP3 Player]] perfectly, with accurate cutouts and raised buttons where appropriate.  One small caveat, there is an extra cutout that doesn&#x27;t seem to have any purpose on the upper right corner (see Picture Gallery).  I&#x27;d imagine it&#x27;s for a Korean version of the player that allows for small charms to be attached at that corner.  I have a [[ASIN:B0060QHPCO Skinomi TechSkin - Black Carbon Fiber Film Shield &amp; Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy 4.0 Android Mp3 Player]] on the way that I had purchased before this case appeared on Amazon, which should cover the exposed area while still allowing me to use this case, which is excellent.  The case itself is a flexible silicone rubber, but coated so that it doesn&#x27;t have that sticky feel, so it won&#x27;t pull out pockets.  All in all, quite satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received exactly on the delivery estimate date, which is pretty impressive for delivering to Afghanistan.</li>
    <li> The Ringke case fits my 4.0 Galaxy Player perfectly, like it came from the factory with the player. Perfect fit, holes for headphones, USB and speakers line up perfectly, buttons all work fine. Nice rubbery feel keeps the player from sliding around. Well worth the money since without the case the player is very easy to drop.</li>
    <li> finally, my samsung galaxy player 4 has arrived here in the Philippines. bought it together with the RINGKE. it fits the player perfectly... no problems seen with this protector...&lt;br /&gt;AWESOOOOOME!!!</li>
    <li> I love the case because it is the perfect fit and it costs less than where I got it from.</li>
    <li> this has been a very good cover for my galaxy player since 2012 and still going strong</li>
    <li> Got this for my nephew and it fits perfect</li>
    <li> Fits great, sturdy, I am happy.  Good choice for a player with few cases available at this time.  Recommended: YES  Con: strange uncovered spot on upper right corner (no explanation or purpose noted)</li>
    <li> I put protective covers/sleeves/cases on all my electronic gadgets. The Ringke is custom fit to the Samsung Galaxy Player 4.0. I&#x27;ve tried others that were much less than satisfactory. The material is flexible yet substantial, doesn&#x27;t vacuum up all the lint in my pocket or bag, and provides great grip. Do not hesitate to purchase this item.</li>
    <li> This product is really great, it fits the player perfectly. The cutouts and buttons are in the right place. Your Samsung Galaxy Player will appreciate you buy this.</li>
    <li> Shipping was pretty quick and packaged well. The cover fits very well over the player and is extremely easy to attach and remove. Each of the input/output ports are accessible with the case on. The built-in speakers and mic are unobscured and still work well. However, the volume and sleep buttons are completely concealed, covered with \\&quot;pseudo-buttons\\&quot; built into the case. It&#x27;s a little cumbersome to use those buttons, but they&#x27;re still functional. The cover does a great job of covering all the corners and edges. It looks as if the player was dropped from a height of 4 to 6 feet it&#x27;d stand a fairly good chance of being safe from any dents and scratches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only major con with this case (and all phone/mp3 cases for that matter) is that you end up feeling like you&#x27;ve grossly overpaid for a product which must have cost pennies to make.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about ordering this device online.  I shouldn&#x27;t have been.  The package arrived about four days later.  It was in good shape, worked perfectly.  My daughter saved up for this.  She was excited about it&#x27;s arrival so I&#x27;m glad it didn&#x27;t take long.  She loved everything about it.  She even tracked it&#x27;s journey. She learned about shipping sites and the time it takes between them.  In all, we got more that just a player.  We had a great learning experience.  I haven&#x27;t said anything about it&#x27;s speed or function so----it loads quickly, the extended memory --we used 32g card w/o problems, she uses it for pictures, downloads, attaches to wifi easily.  We have no complaints.  Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> The case fits the Galaxy 4 very nicely with cut outs in all the right places.  I bought the case because the Galaxy&#x27;s  case is so slippery it&#x27;s hard to hang onto.  The rubber case is a big improvement.  But, if I could make a change, it would be to give it just a little more tack.  It&#x27;s ok as is, but a little more tack would make it better.</li>
    <li> The case fits the Samsung Galaxy 4.0 Player perfectly, its cutouts are accurate and perfectly raised buttons where appropriate. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that there is an extra cutout on the upper right corner of the case that doesn&#x27;t seem to have any purpose and leaves the device uncovered. Overall, I consider it a very good purchase since its a quality product.</li>
    <li> The main reason I bought this case was to keep it from getting scratched and to protect it against falls, and so far it has worked well. It does add bulk and isn&#x27;t really flashy but it fits my galaxy player well (model YP-G1). One note, if you are listening to music through the speakers, having the back against a flat surface really muffles the sound, although that&#x27;s not much different than without a case.</li>
    <li> This Rearth Ringke Case for the Samsung Galaxy Player 4.0 fit&#x27;s perfectly.  I&#x27;ve been waiting for a case like this since October 2011.  Finally, something to hide my little scratches since no one had these cases when the galaxy first became available.  Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> This case perfectly fits the Samsung Galaxy Player. As another reviewer mentioned, its matte black rubber finish does not attract lint/car hair/whatever may be hiding in your pocket or bag. All the switches, cameras, speakers, etc are all easily accessible. Definitely a must if you have this Samsung device.</li>
    <li> I like the Case but do wish There were more choices besides the ones sold now. This was the better of the products I read about</li>
    <li> I love this case.I accidentally tore a corner trying to put it on.I super glued the corner and kept on moving.</li>
    <li> This item fit my player perfectly and putting it on took about 5 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;All the buttons work fine and the cutouts align and fit to a \\&quot;T\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s an extra cutout of the upper right hand corner for some reason but it doesn&#x27;t seem to detract from the protection this case offers.</li>
    <li> Other that the lack of grippy rubber feel, this is exactly the same thing as one of the cheap $3-$4 covers.  As soon as I opened the box, I felt a pain in my chest!  Definitely not worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  It has now been 6 months and the case has become loose, the supposed non-grippy coating is coming off and it has torn where it has the cutout for the korean version&#x27;s antenna.  Doesn&#x27;t serve it&#x27;s purpose anymore.</li>
    <li> I got the Galaxy 4 MP3 player as a gift, and my wife said she could not find any cases for it. Being a fairly new product, there wasn&#x27;t alot to choose from. However, I got online and found this one. Reviews for the most part were good, so decided to get it. Glad I did. It fits perfectly, and has a non-slip feel. The areas that cover the buttons are raised, making it easy to locate them without looking. Would definitely recommend the product.</li>
    <li> fits well!  not as thick as i would like but not bad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;until some new cases are made for this player, this case is not a bad choice-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------the customer service could not be better!!---------------  thank you-</li>
    <li> This case is perfect for the Samsung Galaxy 3.6!  It fits snug, is lightweight and has a great feel.  It is all the wonderful things that have been written about it. I like the black color (very sleek), but my son was hoping it came in various colors and/or patterns besides the black - perhaps in the future.  Thank you Ringke!</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly. Dropped the device many times and it protected it very well. Slim design and very light weight. Great!</li>
    <li> looks so cool when you put it on.  Glad I got it and I have no complaints with the product.</li>
    <li> The first-time my husband took off the case it ripped. This seems to be due to the material it is made of. The company was quick to issue me a full refund.</li>
    <li> The corner ripped pretty quickly but it does protect your player. It makes it really bulky though. The texture of it makes it stay in your pocket.</li>
    <li> This case was a perfect for our Galaxy Player 4. It is simple to put on and provides that extra cushion of protection if the unit is dropped. It also makes is easier to hold onto and less likely to slip out of your hand. It thin enough to not add a bunch of extra bulk. Very nice case!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this case before and its a good one. It protects the back of my Galaxy player although I just call it my phone, and it doesn&#x27;t have many marks on the back battery door.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Protects from scratches on the back of the Galaxy player,make it easier to grip the device when its in your hand, overall looks nice on the player, and doesn&#x27;t leave marks like hard cases do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: On the upper right corner of the case on the top there&#x27;s a cut out piece of the case that leaves that corner slightly exposed, but I have no idea what its for. If you&#x27;re like me and you like to play with the case, you&#x27;ll notice that because its made of silicone/rubbery material your case can get stretched out easily. My first soft Ringke case was the same as this one, but it came free with my purchase of the Galaxy player. Unforunately, after more than a year of owning the case I discovered a rip in the upper right corner.</li>
    <li> Really nice case that puts traction on your grip without making the player bulky. This case keeps a slim profile.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for the Samsung Galaxy 4.0 MP3 player. It was easy to slip this right on the player. The case also makes the player slip-less. I sure wouldn&#x27;t want to drop the player do to not being able to hold onto it. My hands do get sweaty at times when playing games.  You won&#x27;t go wrong buying this for your player.</li>
    <li> Great product.  This is the best case/skin I have found for the galaxy player 4.0.  It fits perfectly and allows all the right openings.  I bought a case a best buy and another online and both were sub par.  although I think the price is a bit high compared to other skins, I would highly recommend this case/skin to protect your galaxy player.</li>
    <li> This is a good case for the Samsung. It is a replacement for one that has seen a lot of abuse and age.  Wouldn&#x27;t use any other.</li>
    <li> Tight and new replacement for old soft case. I may buy another just in case they stop making them for my old Galaxy II.</li>
    <li> I ordered this, along with the Samsung Galaxy Player 4.0, 16GB Micro SD card, and 5x Samsung Galaxy S Player Wifi 4 4.0 4.0\\&quot; Premium Clear LCD Screen Protector Cover Guard Shield Protective Film Kit (5 Pieces) (check out review) at the same time. This was the first to arrive. I got it in exactly 2 days after I ordered it. If ordering by USPS it comes in a white box, that is used in standard USPS shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself comes in its own box that has a clear face to show you what the product looks like. It is easy to open and the the Rearth Case sits in a clear indentation package when you pull it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rearth case fits like a glove and as the description says it add hardly any bulk to the player. It adds about an 1/16 of an inch off the screen of the player which is a good thing. As what they call it the Easy Button technology, does fit every button perfectly, so there&#x27;s no need to worry about them. There are cut outs for the headphone jack, usb door, and a random cutout on the top of the device. On the bottom there&#x27;s a small cutout for the reset button. On the left hand side just above where the volume rocker is we have a cutout, for I think the lanyard. Finally on the back of the products there&#x27;s a cut out for the camera, and speakers, and along with some branding on the left hand side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great benefit of this case is that, it doesn&#x27;t give you finger prints whatsoever, and it provides a non stick kind of feeling to the otherwise slippy feeling you get with the Galaxy player. However, one drawback I find is the price. I think $20 bucks is a bit expensive for these types of things, but what can you do. I highly recommend this product for those who want a quick and easy way to protect their players.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 5/30/12&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how it happening but it seems like the case got a torn in the upper left hand corner. It still fits but I think that it is unfortunate that it had to happen a mere 2 months after gettingthe case. Good thing is my player still looks like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 8/23/12&lt;br /&gt;Again the case has another tear this time on the right hand corner. It still fits, but I have been forced to buy an alternative case. I really like the design of it, but it just sucks to spend 16 bucks on a case that has already failed. I read one review that recommends the Black TPU Gel Case for Samung Galaxy Player 4.0. So I bought it and it is way better than this case.</li>
    <li> This is a excellent product. It seems very durable and does what it supposed to do. The only complain is that I think it is overly priced.</li>
    <li> I have had this case on my SGP 4.0 for five months now. This time has let me see how the case holds up over time. The packaging the case came in was very good looking, the cardboard box having a slightly speckled look to it. The case also looked great, having a matte black colour, well made molding around the buttons and a little groove around the outside edge that lends a bit more grip to it. It fit perfectly, around the speaker grills in the back, the camera, the USB receptacle and the 3.5mm audio jack. The slot cut out in the upper right hand corner for the antenna on the Korean version doesn&#x27;t affect the degree of protection much, as the material is thick enough around the edges to keep the corner from bumping into anything unless dropped from more than 18 inches or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there are two problems that developed with time. One was that after about three months the non-sticky coating on the case began to wear off. Not a bit deal in my books as it only wears in the areas that are in constant contact with my hand and a little extra grip is welcome to keep the device \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; in my hand. However, the problem that really bugs  me and that took a star off the product is that the case has stretched significantly since I first bought it. Whereas it fit quite snugly at first, the SGP 4.0 now slides around inside the case. The slots cut out for the speaker grills and camera no longer line up correctly unless I slide the case around and there is over 2mm of play side to side and up and down. I am careful to keep it out of direct sunlight and extreme temperatures, the coldest weather it has been is about 15 degrees Celsius and the warmest is body temperature when I store it in my pants pockets. I&#x27;d consider this normal use for such a case and wouldn&#x27;t expect such stretching to occur. For comparison, I have a Samsung T10 (think iPod Nano 4G) that has been in a similar silicone case for exactly three years and almost no stretching has occurred. Granted, it is aslightly smaller device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m happy with the case. It does its job, protecting the device, fairly well. It has survived one five foot drop with no adverse affects whatsoever and keeps the white plastic back looking pristine.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit, buttons function very well through the cover.  Case is nice and thin, and covers up the stark whiteness of the player (it&#x27;s not an iPod people!).  Fast shipping, too.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Product seemed nice, though a bit expensive by my judgment. But when it fell apart, the rubber tore, in less than two month I give it only 2 stars.</li>
    <li> I bought two other protectors for my Samsung Galaxy Player, one was some kind of decal that was total rubbish and threw it in the garbage, the second one was some kind of hard plastic cover that came in two pieces which was too small and not correct for the player, even though the advert said it was.  I finally, broke down and bought this one and am very pleased.  It&#x27;s one piece and fits like a glove and it&#x27;s not glossy or jelly looking like most silicone cases, has a nice black finish to it.  The only complaint I got is the price.  18 bucks is a bit steep, but considering there isn&#x27;t much competition out there, you gotta pay it if you want a protector.</li>
    <li> really enjoy the case, it works great! Looks like it came installed from the factory. I will buy another one for the next product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> i got this case for my 14 year old. it is durable, clean looking and functional. we would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Every little detail was thought of when designing this case. From the speaker cut-outs to the 3.5mm jack hole this case fits perfectly.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a birthday gift. The item arrived quickly and I have not heard of any issues with the case.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a loose fit and easily taken off, but serves its purpose i don&#x27;t know about frontal drops but against the area the case protects is decent enough. Wouldn&#x27;t buy unless under 10 bucks. Only option I&#x27;ve seen for Galaxy Player 4.0 though so...</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t fit well and my kids tend to take it off b/c they say it is too loose.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> this case was not wat I exspected at al. Instead of sending a case it sent a sticker case tht keeps peeling and does not protect my device when I drop it. I DO NOT recommmend this.</li>
    <li> Did what is was supposed to do, looked nice but broke after a few years of fair use. I was sort of expecting that, I haven&#x27;t bought a new one as a I use a different device now. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I pre-ordered pink case. even though i&#x27;ve waited for 2 week, it&#x27;s worth it.  I like the color and case material~</li>
    <li> I was the right one and was deliverd on time. I would recommend others to use this method. I was unable to find the case any where.</li>
    <li> Where to start on this review.&lt;br /&gt;I got the Samsung Galaxy Player for christmas and I really did not need a case for my old mp3 and so I decided not to get one for this one. I had visited some relatives and they asked my if I wanted a case for it since they had an extra lying around I said no because I was pretty careful with it. When I returned home I took it with my to get a piece of toilet paper and I ended up dropping my Player. I got so worried that if I dropped it again I would end up breaking it for sure so I started looking for a case. Being that it is relatively knew to the market cases are hard to find. The only ones I could find where the ones that you stick on.&lt;br /&gt;At first I was a little corncerned about the price but I decided to get it anyways. Since Amazon charged for shipping I went straight to their website and I got free 2 day shipping. After I ordered it I got it 2 days later. I opened up the package and I was surprised because I thought It would be the gummy silicone case but it was not it was more of the harder silicone material. It does have the weird opening on the right hand corner. It does seem that this type material will last longer than the other kind. Since I got the case I have dropped it a couple of times and it does do its job. The only con is the price.</li>
    <li> It is the only cover that fits the Galaxy Player 4.0. I like that it doesn&#x27;t feel like rubber. It gets the job done but it&#x27;s over priced. Not really worth the $16.00 price tag.</li>
    <li> The case was easy as can be to put on.  It fit perfectly.  It makes the player less likely to slip as well as provides a bit of protection from unintended collisions.  Excellent so far.  No problems.</li>
    <li> I got this case because the one that came with it was cracked. It was a hard case and it didn&#x27;t do a great job of protecting my player. This one, however, is perfect. It&#x27;s a little hard to get on and off if you&#x27;re removing it to clean it or something, but other than that, it&#x27;s the perfect case. If you have a Galaxy Player 4.0, get this case. :) I also liked the eco packaging. That was nice, Rearth Ringke. I wish more companies would consider eco friendly packaging.</li>
    <li> My friend and I both bought the Samsung Galaxy Player 4 a few months back when they were first introduced, and he bought this Ringke Case, while I decided to wait and check out his Ringke case before deciding whether to purchase one for my Player also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the high price I was expecting a very classy two piece design like some of the Otterbox cell phone cases which have a nice thick soft inner silicon jacket providing protective cushioning that is held tightly and precisely in place by a separate outer hard polycarbonate shell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that&#x27;s not what you are getting at all, it&#x27;s just a simple little flimsy one-piece slip on boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the price kind of high for such a simple product, but given the lack of available options, I probably would have given in and put up with the gouging on the price, except that, as some others have already commented, I noticed that this case has a REALLY STUPID TOTALLY UNNECESSARY HOLE THAT PREVENTS IT FROM PROVIDING PROPER PROTECTION ON ONE CORNER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exposed area is right up near the top corner of the case near the auto-focus camera (which is one of the few parts of the player with delicate moving parts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decide to wait and eventually found a similar slip-on boot on eBay which provides a similar degree of protection overall (but minus the silly unnecessary hole) at a buy-it-now cost of $2.99 delivered with free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For comparison purposes, the clear \\&quot;Soft TPU Gel Case For Samsung Galaxy S Wifi 4.0 YP-G1\\&quot; case I purchased for only $2.99 is also just a little over a millimeter thick, so like the Rearth product, it&#x27;s impact absorption is somewhat limited, but it has a nice solid feel, is not &#x27;tacky&#x27; at all, and it fits my Galaxy Player 4 like a glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked my inexpensive case so well that I also purchased the same case in medium gray (listed as \\&quot;Gray Soft TPU Case For Samsung Galaxy S Wifi 4.0 YP-G1\\&quot;)  Both cases featurean attractive almost invisible linked ring pattern accent. (there may be other patterns and colors available, but these are the only two I have actually purchased and compared side-by-side with the Rearth Ringke Case)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fairness, I originally liked the button handling on the Rearth product a little more, because the buttons on the outside of the TPU cases I purchased on eBay are are not raised beyond tiny bumps that are almost flush.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong on this, the buttons areas on my TPU cases are properly recessed inside the case in exactly the proper places, and the material above the buttons has been thinned enough to allow them to be pressed easily, but they are pretty much flush on the outside and don&#x27;t sick out so you can easily locate them by touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the buttons are definitely easier to locate by touch on my friends Rearth Ringke case, but this wasn&#x27;t enough to make me want to pay more than 5 times as much for a case which doesn&#x27;t provide proper protection on one corner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, now that I have gotten used to the flush button arrangement on my TPU case, I&#x27;m not sure that I don&#x27;t actually prefer it, because you don&#x27;t have to worry about the slightly protruding buttons catching on a thread as you remove the case from your pocket (sounds like a minor issue I know, but I lost a phone a few years back when it snagged slightly coming out of my pocket, popped out of my hand, and fell to the floor and was damaged beyond repair).  The slightly soft plastic of my TPU case adds a nice \\&quot;grippy\\&quot; feeling that helps keep the case from slipping from my hand or pocket, without any stickiness or snag issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that this comparative review will be helpful to those who have lamented the lack of case options for the Galaxy Players.</li>
    <li> Fits very snug around the Samsung galaxy player 4.0! You can barely tell that there is a case on. I havn&#x27;t dropped it so i cant report on it&#x27;s durability.</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly on my Galaxy 4.0 player, it&#x27;s thin so it does not feel bulky and still provides good protection, this product is well made and I am extremely happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> cheap made waste of money</li>
    <li> Update: I contact the seller who said the cover was designed for a phone in another country, and that phone has an antenna in the area where the hole is.  The description really should state that the case isn&#x27;t actually designed for the Galaxy Player. The item&#x27;s title is deceptive.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------&lt;br /&gt;I bought this case because it LOOKED, based on the pictures in the item&#x27;s description, that the glove covered everything except for the ports.  There is, however, a corner in the upper right of the phone that is not covered. Why? I don&#x27;t know.  There&#x27;s no antenna sticking out of my SGP 4.0, so I don&#x27;t know why this hole is there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I really like the fact that the case covers the area where the screen meets the frame, which is an area where every device I&#x27;ve ever had seems to gather specks of lint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case feels slippery to me so I will likely try to add something to give it some texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that annoying hole in the upper right, the case does fit exceptionally well and doesn&#x27;t add a lot of bulk.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I wound up with this.  It isn&#x27;t what I asked for and now I need to send it back.  Hassle.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice case and it served its purpose as expected. I would recommend this product to anyone with a Samsung Galaxy Player for its looks and protection of the player.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter.  Couldn&#x27;t find one for her player anywhere.  This helps and looks nice.  The case is durable.</li>
    <li> There is little to choose from for the Galaxy Player 4.0, but this is a good option.  It&#x27;s for my son and he had a Otterbox Commuter for the Samsung Vibrant (Tmobile Galaxy S) and it worked well, but wasn&#x27;t perfect.  We chose this one based on fit and he&#x27;s happy.  It offers little for impact protection, but looks good and will help avoid scratches.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly the Galaxy Player 4, it&#x27;s soft and seems durable. I think that it will do a great job protecting my  Galaxy player from any accdents. The seller Didn&#x27;t take too long to ship. I got it pretty fast.</li>
    <li> Case is very lightweight, but also seems to add a greater amount of protecting. A perfect fit. I would recommend this case.</li>
    <li> Works well easy fit, stops any slippage of player from hands. Easy to clean and maintain. Enjoy the item totally.</li>
    <li> When I bought the Samsung Galaxy player 4.0 I searched everywhere for a case to protect my investment. (I bought 3 for family members). These cases hit the market soon after and as far as I can tell are still about the only thing out there for my particular model. The cases are very durable and light. They don&#x27;t add too much bulk to the device and all of the ports and buttons are easily accessible. I have dropped it a few times and the case has done it&#x27;s job nicely. So why Three stars instead of five? I thought I would see how the case performed over time since, in my experience time WILL tell, and it did. I received my 3 cases (@ 18.00each)within a week of ordering them back in Feb of 2012. At first they were fantastic. I slipped them on and they fit like a fine glove should. Then in July my oldest child began to notice that her case began to stretch out a bit after normal use (she has a protective neoprene sleeve rather than using her pockets as well). I figured she might have a defective one that was too big to begin with (it happens sometimes). Then in September I began to notice the same happening to mine. My wife rarely uses her player so I checked it and sure enough the case had expanded. None of the cases are usable anymore because they are just too big (mine measured 3mm too big all the way around, so they slip right off). If you are looking for a case to fit the Galaxy Player 4.0, this is probably about your only option unless you want to go to the expense of having something custom made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Great feel&lt;br /&gt;good look&lt;br /&gt;no bulk&lt;br /&gt;pretty much the only option&lt;br /&gt;fast delivery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Stretches out eventually&lt;br /&gt;really pricey for what you get</li>
    <li> Really hard to find cases for this model Galaxy, so we were thrilled to get this one. It&#x27;s a soft case, but not too soft and it feels really nice in your hand. Seems to be well made, time will tell. I&#x27;d recommend this case over a hard case, as a hard case will crack easily and finding another is not so easy.</li>
    <li> So far this has proven to be a good investment. I have not experienced any stretching on the case. The sides are a little loose compared to the top and bottom if you pluck at them, but i don&#x27;t. I also bought a lens shield that works great with this.</li>
    <li> This slip-on, rubbery case fits the Samsung Galaxy Player 4.0 correctly, with openings aligning properly on the various ports. However, there is an opening in the corner at the top right that serves no apparent purpose, and could allow the player&#x27;s plastic to crack if it fell on that corner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case provides protection from bumps and dings, but isn&#x27;t thick/heavy enough to protect it from a real impact. Because it doesn&#x27;t seal tightly around the edges, I suspect it will collect pocket lint &amp; dust over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s okay for what it is, but shouldn&#x27;t cost this much. I bought it mainly to have --something-- on the player until I find something that I like better.</li>
    <li> I got this case with my galaxy player, and i was impressed! It fits very nice with the device . All the holes line up perfect fpr a perfect fit!</li>
    <li> Foamy protection, but a little slippery feeling. Protects around the screen better than some others. Allows good feel/function to covered buttons and does a good job overall. Subtracted one star for the slippery feel.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Galaxy 4.0 Media Player.  Fits great.  One cut-out that&#x27;s not necessary which may have some application for the galaxy line of phones (who knows).  It&#x27;s not overly bulky and as a result not overly sturdy, but my guess would be that it would protect the unit from scratches, etc. due to minor falls.  Whether this would protect the unit from a more severe fall, is up for debate as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  I just don&#x27;t see the case absorbing the shock of a fall but it would likely prevents scratches to the plastic case.  For me even though it&#x27;s a little pricey, it&#x27;s worth the perceived level of protection because I would foresee minor falls versus severe falls.</li>
    <li> I like it. Fits fine on the player, feels god at hand and the holes fit with the camera. Good value for the price.</li>
    <li> The feel of the case is good. I like how it&#x27;s not too bulky.</li>
    <li> Very good protection for son&#x27;s Galaxy Player.  With the Soft Case AND Tech Skin his Galaxy Play still looks like new.</li>
