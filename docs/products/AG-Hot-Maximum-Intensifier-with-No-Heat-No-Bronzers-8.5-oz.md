      <li>but it is still my all time favorite.  </li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite lotions as I like to switch out using lotions with bronzers and ones without bronzers like this one.</li>
      <li>I was getting a great tan; and she wasn&#x27;t getting much of one.</li>

      <li>I get a wonderful tan that lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>smells great, makes my skin feel nourished and soft.</li>
      <li>Though it doesnt make you smell fantastic after tanning but most lotions are like that.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t tan that easily...</li>
      <li>Love these products use them all sunscreens and after sun also highly recommend them all  lovely smell great tan very moisturising</li>
      <li>Shipping was quick and if I tan again this year, I will reorder!</li>

      <li>You just have to purchase it more frequently.</li>
      <li>It gets absorbed right into the skin.  </li>
      <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin too, and it works fine for me.  </li>
      <li>This lotion smells like cheap early 80&#x27;s Farrah faucet.</li>
      <li>Every since I had my first child 6 years ago</li>
      <li>I agree I am tanning better after starting to use the lotion.</li>
      <li>, if you close your eyes you really think you&#x27;re in the bahamas sippin a mai tai!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> very good lotion, i just wish australian gold would come out with a different smell.</li>
    <li> Works the best on my ginger skin😜</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly.  I&#x27;ve only used once</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pasty, ridiculously white. Every since I had my first child 6 years ago I thought I was unable to tan.. not anymore. I&#x27;ve used this product for two days and already the sickly white is gone and my base tan is starting to shine through! I highly recommend this to pale complexions!</li>
    <li> Great color in the beds and I do wear outside also  - be careful though as of course it does not have SPF; however for me - it is perfect as I have very olive skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this product years ago that I purchased in a tanning salon and then I couldn&#x27;t find it for so long and found it on Amazon.  I love it.  It gets you so dark.  I use it at the tanning salon and in the sun.  Its a great product and would recommend this to anyone.  It has a great tropical scent to it as well.</li>
    <li> I really dislike this lotion. Learned something... Don&#x27;t change if what you use works. Fierce D dense is tons better. This lotion smells like cheap early 80&#x27;s Farrah faucet. If that&#x27;s your thing, then have at it. It&#x27;s thin and watery and my color faded so much faster using this as opposed to fierce D. And I really despise the after tan aroma.</li>
    <li> Maybe I expected too much but this lotion left no tingle at all for me.  I do like the smell, the feel, and the color return.  I probably won&#x27;t purchase again simply because I like a hotter feel to my tanning lotions.</li>
    <li> Always a sure thing.Can&#x27;t beat the price on here</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lotion. I used to buy it directly at my tanning salon but I paid probably twice the price as I did here. Exact same thing, same size, same everything! So glad I found it on here and ordered it! This lotion actually smells good (like skittles), and you do tan a lot quicker/darker than using no lotion, or any other lotion I&#x27;ve tried. Also, if there is a bronzer present in it, it&#x27;s very subtle, not one of those lotions that are going to turn your hands funny colors, or that you&#x27;re going to get out of the tanning bed looking nice and tan and then watch it wash off 90% of the way in the shower!</li>
    <li> This lotion is great. I started tanning for an upcoming vacation and my skin became very dry and itchy from the tanning lights. This lotion kept my skin from drying out and gave me a natural tan. I like that it doesn&#x27;t contain bronzer and that its affordable!</li>
    <li> I use this product exclusively when I go to the tanning salon. I have extremely dry skin, and this product moisturizes like no other. My tan is rich and golden, and my skin feels great to boot. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for about 2 months and this is my favorite lotion, also the HOT! with bronzer is really affective as well.  It smells great, if you close your eyes you really think you&#x27;re in the bahamas sippin a mai tai!</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion several months ago, and I now am going to purchase it again. I am naturally very pale with sensitive skin. With this lotion, I tan well, and it helps my skin stay hydrated. The smell is a plus also. Buying it here on Amazon, I save about $30 compared to my local Palm Beach Tan. Good buy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for about 6 months now.  I&#x27;ve had problems with some lotions in the past not meshing well with my body chemistry and just plain stinking after a tanning session.  This lotion smells just as good after a tanning session as it does in the bottle.  I prefer not to use bronzers and intensifiers to keep my tan looking as natural as possible year round.  This lotion does the job perfectly.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS AG SOOO MUCH I HAD TO ORDER A SENOND BOTTLE ..IT IS THE BEST WELL ONE OF THE BEST:) I RECOMMEND TO INDOOR OR OUTDOOR TANNERS!!!!</li>
    <li> Love these products use them all sunscreens and after sun also highly recommend them all  lovely smell great tan very moisturising</li>
    <li> Only used once, but the smell is lovely. The tan is deep and I am not dry. PERFECT! Quick delivery as well. Just want I wanted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved the results I&#x27;ve had with this product. Typically, it&#x27;s hard for me to get a base tan, but not with Hot! No bronzers (so you don&#x27;t look orange), and the smell remains incredible even after a tan. I&#x27;ll definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Very good for vacation preparation.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my parents who just signed up for a tanning membership to prepare themselves for a trip to Belize in two months. Their in their mid 40s and they seem to love this lotion. I like that it can be used indoor as well as outdoor. Though it doesnt make you smell fantastic after tanning but most lotions are like that.</li>
    <li> Great intensifier.  I absolutely love the scent!  I&#x27;d definitely buy it again.  (And I don&#x27;t share the one I have, lol!)</li>
    <li> I love hot lotion and this was fits the bill. It also came with a protective sticker on the bottle so I knew it was new and never opened. That is a PLUS for me. Smells great and works great!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite lotions as I like to switch out using lotions with bronzers and ones without bronzers like this one. It is an intensifier. I don&#x27;t understand all the reviews that said the &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34;didn&#x27;t work or it wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; or the &amp;#34;bronzers&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t work??? It is an intensifier and says in the name NO HEAT NO BRONZERS so I don&#x27;t know why People expect it to have either. I lay in the bronzing beds at the salon which are more expensive but give a bronze color and you don&#x27;t need bronzing lotions in those. This is very moisturizing but the best thing about it besides the natural beautiful color you get is the awesome smell!! I love it! I even use it again at night as a moisturizer and at amazons discounted price, I can!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this same brand and product for years, very clean smell rubs on quick and delivers a good dark tan without bronzers, by far the best tanning lotion I have ever used</li>
    <li> Makes a big difference to my tanning. apply 30 minutes before going in. It gives me a much nicer color and I don&#x27;t have to tan as often to maintain a nice color. Lotion has a good scent :)</li>
    <li> great tanning lotion!</li>
    <li> Awesome .  only tanning lotion I use.</li>
    <li> Smells very fresh and moisturizes tremendously! I even use this outside as well!</li>
    <li> I was getting sick of using tanning lotions that had a lot of bronzers and fortunately stumbled upon this little gem. It stands up to its brand-name and delivers a great tan. I would recommend using this if you already have a nice base tan, you might not think it&#x27;s working if you&#x27;re used to lotions with bronzers that make you look really dark after just one session -- but unlike those other lotions, this is actually helping your skin to tan naturally, instead of coating your body in bronzers and giving you a faux tan look. Besides all that, the smell is really sweet and fun and doesn&#x27;t give you a nasty scent after getting out of the bed. I usually don&#x27;t like products that are scented with bubblegum or coconut, which this seems to have both, but it seems to work for Australian Gold :) The price is also something to be happy about !</li>
    <li> Nice smell and much better results than I was getting using Hempz products. I loved that it has zero bronzers in it because I used this when tanning for my wedding and was terrified of staining my dress.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have been tanning since August. We had the real expensive lotion with the bronzers in it. I figured we had to switch it up a little bit. Although my daughter is half Italian; she is white as a ghost-due to my Irish, English, French!  I was getting a great tan; and she wasn&#x27;t getting much of one. It was really odd that after tanning for several months; even at level 2; she just wasn&#x27;t as dark as me! I decided to switch to this lotion; and now she is darker than I am! Although it works for me also!  So I give this a solid 5 stars because it really WORKS!  If there is a downside; it&#x27;s that this doesn&#x27;t last very long....this is her second bottle. Comes out a bit fast; you have to be careful!  Not bad enough to take off a star. You just have to purchase it more frequently. For a great tan; we sure don&#x27;t mind!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great product just wish they didn&#x27;t smell so sweet</li>
    <li> Great lotion. Really helped me build up my base tan quickly.</li>
    <li> I LOVED this product.  It is NOT hot.  I used it everywhere, including my face.  It accelerates your tan an did not smell burnt after I was done in the tanning bed. It absorbed into my skin well and there was no reaction.  This also does not have a bronzer in it, which was an absolute deal breaker if it did.  I don&#x27;t do bronzing.  Don&#x27;t like it leaching on my clothes and in between my fingers.  I loved this and used it to the very last drop, which lasted me about 30 days.  Shipping was quick and if I tan again this year, I will reorder!</li>
    <li> This is a great tanning lotion. It smells great and moisturizes better than other tanning lotions. I get a wonderful tan that lasts a long time. Love this product and highly recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is the bomb...I LOVE...because you can use it in the sun also. Awesome product. Will use again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a nice day,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shelby Parris</li>
    <li> You will get super dark using this! Its nice because it doesn&#x27;t smell like tanning it smells like yummy bubble gum not nasty bubble gum!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite accelerator.  I don&#x27;t tan that easily...at first, especially.  Then, I can usually tan better later on.  This smells great and does not leave a greasy feeling.  It gets absorbed right into the skin.  There is one version with a bronzer and one without - I prefer it without because it&#x27;s very difficult to get it on evenly...and I want to see my &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; tan - not the chemical bronzer orange tan.  I have somewhat sensitive skin too, and it works fine for me.  This is not fake lotion - I ordered it here and used it from this seller - though I&#x27;ve heard there&#x27;s a lot of fake lotion online.  I used this for 5+ years from salons, and this was the first I bought online...same exact thing.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this product and its claim to have tinglers in it.  I am an experienced tanner and would not recommend this product to someone as such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this a beginner who has not experienced a tingler tanning product; although it was not the level of tingle I was looking for it did have some minor tingle to it.</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife because she usually pays $40-$50 for same lotion. Came on time and is just what it says. Very happy to save this much cash using Amazon!</li>
    <li> The tanning place I go to sells this lotion for over $90.00!!!! I felt like a sucker when I found out I could buy it here for so cheap. It doesn&#x27;t have a warmer or a tingle, but I am not a big fan of those. Every time I use a warmer or a tingle it makes me red for a few hours. I LOVE that it provides so much moisture for my skin. It is a really good lotion at a an even better price.</li>
    <li> Love this product, smells great and works too.  I use it as a daily moisturizer as well.  Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> smells great, makes my skin feel nourished and soft. no dyes or tints to this product and this is why I like it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Ordered for my mom and I, since the tanning salon charges $80 for a bottle, way better deal..</li>
    <li> This may be an older product but it is still my all time favorite.  No other product, even with bronzers, can give you this deep color.  This stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> Enjoy using this product! Always works well for me giving me a nice even tan!</li>
    <li> Smells like bubble gum.  i didnt know how I felt about it but it did the trick.  Gives a nice color without a bronzer.</li>
    <li> I had been tanning without lotion and the girl at the salon told me I needed a lotion because one tan with lotion is equal.to 3 without. Then proceeded to offer me a lotion with discount for $75. No thanks what&#x27;s it made of 14k gold? I ordered this and I love it. Its light and goes on smooth, the scent isn&#x27;t bad at all. I agree I am tanning better after starting to use the lotion. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Good price. Good lotion. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have bronzer or tingle. It smells like bubblegum.</li>
