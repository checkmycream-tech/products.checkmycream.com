      <li>I love Nubian Heritage soaps, they do their stuff!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found that when i wash my face with the soap &amp; warm water, my skins feels softer &amp; not dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Exfoliates nicely...</li>
      <li>Really liked this soap.</li>
      <li>But if that does not bother you, it looks to be of nice quality.</li>
      <li>I has a really nice mango/orange smell but underlying that is the chemical smell.</li>
      <li>couldn&#x27;t ask for a better price.</li>
      <li>and it so soft,,,,every1 WILL love it</li>
      <li>Love this soap.  </li>

      <li>Nice soap, it really is...</li>
      <li>HOT DAMN!!</li>
      <li>I was very excited about this soap and the first time I used it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of suspect that a &#x27;natural&#x27; fragrance would smell as strong as the fragrance in this soap so even though it&#x27;s a nice fragrance I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s natural.</li>
      <li>Great soap for dry skin.</li>
      <li>Arrived early, soap smells fantastic!!</li>

      <li>Love that it&#x27;s all natural</li>
      <li>but I love it for the smell and how soft it makes your skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has made a nice treat before I go back to the mighty Irish Spring.</li>
      <li>Incredible soap, makes you smell so fresh and clean, it&#x27;s the only one I use now?try it, you won&#x27;t regret it, expensive but worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Has a somewhat subtly, but very nice scent.</li>
      <li>It lathers well (even in our pretty hard water); the bar is exhibiting good endurance.</li>
      <li>A huge 5 ounces (compared to voda soap, which is only 2, and costs 9 bucks...</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Absolutely has a VERY fruity scent.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t until I tried to rinse off that I noticed a very soapy residue on my skin.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say I highly reccomend it,</li>
      <li>It must have 200mgs of sugar or more in it, almost like raw or concentrate mango juice.</li>
      <li>its all natural!</li>

<li> I use the soft buffer, the skin is a bit drier, but I know its because the dead skin has been buffed away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> unfoertunately it is just a bit strange that soap would smell that pungent.</li>

<li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry.</li>
<li> i have icthyosis and extremely dry skin</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a good soap when you&#x27;re in a bad mood, also not intended for anyone who is hungry, but if you already had a meal and you use this soap, your olfactory senses will make you think you had desert already, and you wouldn&#x27;t want to have to feel like eating!</li>
<li> I use it along with a round facial buffer(circular motion).</li>
<li> Does leave my skin a little dry.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not as bad as regular soap which is a blast of chemicals</li>
<li> dont have a REAL complaint.</li>
<li> Too expensive for what you get here.</li>

    <li> great soap - smells really good.  couldn&#x27;t ask for a better price.</li>
    <li> HOT DAMN!! Jojoba oil, Mango Butter, Shea Butter, Cocoa Butter, Avocado Butter, Aloe Vera AND Vitamin E!!! I&#x27;ve hit the mother load! A huge 5 ounces (compared to voda soap, which is only 2, and costs 9 bucks...)AND its all natural! i have icthyosis and extremely dry skin and i can&#x27;t wait to try this out and see the results!</li>
    <li> Incredible soap, makes you smell so fresh and clean, it&#x27;s the only one I use now?try it, you won&#x27;t regret it, expensive but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I love Nubian Heritage soaps, they do their stuff! This Mango Butter soap smells so heavenly sweet yet it reminds me of an Orange Creamsicle... It&#x27;s a good soap when you&#x27;re in a bad mood, also not intended for anyone who is hungry, but if you already had a meal and you use this soap, your olfactory senses will make you think you had desert already, and you wouldn&#x27;t want to have to feel like eating!</li>
    <li> Nice soap, it really is... But it is extremely sweet smelling, as in sweet like you have never smelled sweet before. On a scale of&lt;br /&gt;1-10, the strength of the smell is an 11. I can&#x27;t say I highly reccomend it, unfoertunately it is just a bit strange that soap would smell that pungent. It must have 200mgs of sugar or more in it, almost like raw or concentrate mango juice. Too expensive for what you get here. But if that does not bother you, it looks to be of nice quality. Otherwsise check out some coconut soaps, etc., or try your luck elsewhere!</li>
    <li> Love this soap.  It really works good on my skin and it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I use this soap for my face and body.  Leaves skin feeling smooth and soap smells wonderful.  It doesn&#x27;t break my face out.  Love that it&#x27;s all natural</li>
    <li> The best soap I have used for my face &amp; body. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry.</li>
    <li> Because of my MCS (Multiple Chemical Sensitivity) I can smell chemicals. According to my senses, this has chemicals in it. I has a really nice mango/orange smell but underlying that is the chemical smell. It&#x27;s not as bad as regular soap which is a blast of chemicals but it&#x27;s there. It&#x27;s kind of suspect that a &#x27;natural&#x27; fragrance would smell as strong as the fragrance in this soap so even though it&#x27;s a nice fragrance I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s natural.</li>
    <li> Lathers and smells alright. Does leave my skin a little dry. I&#x27;m going to try the coconut papaya next before I reorder this soap.</li>
    <li> I was very excited about this soap and the first time I used it I was very impressed with the smell and lather. It wasn&#x27;t until I tried to rinse off that I noticed a very soapy residue on my skin. I had to wash all over again with another body wash to get it off. Maybe its a bar soap thing but I just couldn&#x27;t do the residue/squeky feeling</li>
    <li> Has a somewhat subtly, but very nice scent. It lathers well (even in our pretty hard water); the bar is exhibiting good endurance. Most importantly to me: it rinses clean. None of that lotion jazz hanging about like a persistent contaminant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has made a nice treat before I go back to the mighty Irish Spring.</li>
    <li> GREAT SMELL, EXFOLIATES, WORKS</li>
    <li> I purchased this soap a long time ago and I&#x27;ve been trying to find it since. It smelt great and my skin felt soft.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t spend more than 2-3 bucks for another but I love it for the smell and how soft it makes your skin. Although I did need lotion after showering, it went well with my Palmers lotion w/shea butter as well as my Jergens w/shea.</li>
    <li> Arrived early, soap smells fantastic!!</li>
    <li> Works great. Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out</li>
    <li> Great soap for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Really liked this soap. Very moisturizing. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely has a VERY fruity scent. However, it doesnt smell fruity once applied to the skin. The lather is wonderful. I use it along with a round facial buffer(circular motion). Great product, Natural ingredients. Exfoliates nicely... DONT let the fruity scent detour U from using... :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 5/3/13&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that when i wash my face with the soap &amp; warm water, my skins feels softer &amp; not dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use the soft buffer, the skin is a bit drier, but I know its because the dead skin has been buffed away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, all-in-all, I love this soap. dont have a REAL complaint. I will continue to purchase. I am on week two &amp; I definitely see a difference in my skin tone. I use this product strictly on my face &amp; neck area.</li>
    <li> I fighting with my daughters,,,,because they want it,,,,but they got problems,,,its mine,,,and I will get more for me,,,they haveto get their own,,,,It smells great and it so soft,,,,every1 WILL love it</li>
