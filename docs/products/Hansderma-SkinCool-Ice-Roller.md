    <li> I&#x27;m a very active person and I sometimes experience muscle aches. I use the ice roller to massage those areas that are sore after a workout. It&#x27;s very convenient, light weight, and inexpensive. You can take it with you and it will stay cool for hours.</li>
    <li> This is an elegant product that does what it says!  PLUS the ordering process was easy and quick.  This company has done a great job!  Get your ICE ROLLER NOW, you will LOVE IT.</li>

I&#x27;m not sure it was worth the money for the professional version, so for home use, I&#x27;d recommend the cheaper one. I haven&#x27;t tried it, but just assume that it works as well!</li>
    <li> A highly useful and elegant way to apply icy temperature to the facial jawline/neck for a quick pick-me-up effect.</li>
    <li> This has got to be my favorite beauty tool.  I love the way it feels on my face and I love what it does to my skin.  It is like putting your face in ice water - your skin looks that good.  If I could carry this with me everywhere I would, and I might get another one to do that.  I got the metal one and even when it is not frozen it feels great.</li>
    <li> I recently had some minor knee surgery and there is an area that I need to ice several times a day. The Skincool Ice Roller was perfect because I can roll the chilled roller over an isolated area rather than have an ice pack cover skin that doesn&#x27;t need to be iced!  The Skincool Ice Roller allows you to focus on the area that needs icing.&lt;br /&gt;Try cooling your eyebrows before and/or after plucking, waxing or threading.  The Skincool Ice Roller works beautifully on insect bits, just roll over the itchy, irritated area for fast releif. I found myseld rolling the Skincool Ice Roller over my joints and a few aching muscles and it felt so cool and relaxing. I use mine almost every day!</li>
    <li> Works good, bought a second one for friend</li>
    <li> I got this for my aunt who swears by it.  She had the plastic one for a while, but I got her this for her birthday.  She says the metal stays cool all the time and she uses it a lot in the summer.  It looks pretty well made to me and does feel really nice on a hot day.</li>
    <li> Purchased this device in hope of reducing my pore size. The device stays cool. Not as cold as the one you can find at the med spa, but cool enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I thought about the cleaning part though. It&#x27;s little difficult to clean, dry, and remembering to put it in your freezer.</li>
    <li> Great product, amazing pricing and it&#x27;s very well made! I&#x27;m very happy to have it for use in my Skin care business.</li>

    <li> I used this roller on my face and it provided me with a cooling sensation. It relaxed the muscles on my face and it felt therapeutic. I think that this product is well worth it&#x27;s price because of all the different purposes it can serve. It can be used to help irritated or sunburnt skin, muscle cramps, help soothe pain and even be used to numb various areas.</li>
    <li> I use it after performing micro-dermal needling! Gives nice relief to the skin..</li>
    <li> This roller is absolutely wonderful for husband to use after a softball game.  I use before, during &amp; after dermatology appointments.</li>
    <li> good stuff for bruises and calming redness</li>

    <li> I get frequent IPL treatments on my face due to a skin condition. The dermatologist&#x27;s office uses one of these rollers post procedure to relief burning and redness. It works very well because it&#x27;s easy to apply to the whole face without one area getting unbearable cold. I bought the metal one since that is what they used. Well worth the money if you get regular skin treatments like IPL, fillers, lasers, etc. I&#x27;ve even used it on some bruises.</li>
