      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>My brother had mentioned to me that he had tried the Yes to Blueberries lotion with sun block and liked the product</li>
      <li>(it soaks in too fast and dries out), but this is PERFECT.</li>
      <li>It has a very light and pleasant smell, and is paraben free!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK during the day layered under another lotion with SPF, but honestly I wouldn&#x27;t consider this a night cream.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not one to make exuberant claims that it&#x27;s restored by face to pre-pubescent flawless glory, but I have noticed (as has my husband) a tangible change in both the texture and brightness of my skin.</li>
      <li>I also liked the packaging is easily recycled.</li>
      <li>I love their condition but would not recommend the night cream.</li>
      <li>/Day Cream is such a wonderful product!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
      <li>Because I absolutely love this product and they are discontinuing it</li>
      <li>Love love love</li>
      <li>Love, love them.</li>
      <li>Basically, I read reviews on this and most of them said they had improvement in their skin condition and complexion</li>
      <li>so I cant really say how great it is</li>
      <li>My best friend recommended this product after I asked her why she looked so much different after not seeing her for a month.    </li>
      <li>Love it a lot.</li>
      <li>My skin looks and feels so much better.  </li>
      <li>But overall GREAT product and a MUST have!!!</li>
      <li>Just another cream that works ok.</li>
      <li>The face wash is my favorite though.</li>
      <li>Okay.</li>
      <li>I found the Yes to Carrots and decided to try one more cream.  </li>
      <li>Bought it many times.</li>
      <li>Love the feel and smell.  </li>
      <li>excellent face cream....makes a big difference</li>
      <li>but overall I am very pleased with Yes to Carrots&#x27; products!!</li>
      <li>I put it on most nights.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve earned them:)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Yes to Carrots Night Cream for about a year now because I love it.  </li>
      <li>My skin is smoother and more refreshed than ever before.</li>
      <li>I bought this because I was trying to find something more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; to use at night.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>I have recommended this product to some co-workers and was able to tell within 3-4 days when they started using this product without even asking.</li>
      <li>I cant use many night creams because i break out easily, but i can use this stuff.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t make my skin as hydrated as I would have liked, thought I love that it is natural and loving to animals.</li>
      <li>I use many of the yes to cucumbers, blueberries and tomatoes line too and have really found them all to be great products, for a very reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>that I think the strong scent is trying to mask.</li>
      <li>Using this product resulted in my face becoming bright red and I experienced an intense stinging sensation.</li>
      <li>but my husband was fine with this.</li>
      <li>The sent I thought was fine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine, but not up to par with</li>
      <li>The smell is light, just a smidgen will cover your face and neck easily, and it leaves your skin feeling smooth.</li>
      <li>You can see a huge difference in your skins dryness after just one night.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and has a nice, neutral smell.</li>
      <li>It apply it generously every night, and every morning I wake up with my skin glowing and looking bright and clear.</li>
      <li>It was really cheap,</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and creamy.  </li>
      <li>This makes sense to me, because all cheap grocery and drug store products have cheap chemically-created scents to which I become allergic.</li>
      <li>I read that it is good to start on a skin care regimen early</li>
      <li>It has a light clean odour, lovely texture, and the price is very competitive.</li>
      <li>It is a great thick cream that I like best for the winter when my skin gets really dry.  </li>
      <li>Makes your skin feel nice and soft.</li>
      <li>Very Sun damaged skin on one of my co-workers was immediately better.</li>
      <li>While I cannot decide if I like the scent and mostly wish it had no scent at all, i really like this cream.  </li>
      <li>it has a very light clean scent... smells like it&#x27;s a natural scent and not added to the product.</li>
      <li>I am over 40 and do not like very many facial products on the market.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and does not leave your face feeling oily right before bed.</li>
      <li>I am usually very satisfied with the night cream, but the particular tub I received seemed old.</li>
      <li>The salicylic acid has also helped clear up my skin, which for me is a huge bonus for a night cream!</li>
      <li>The cream feels amazing and is instantly smoothing on the skin.</li>
      <li>Try Murad products - worth the money.</li>
      <li>have fairly sensitive skin, but I thought this product would be alright because it contained many natural ingredients (natural ingredients don&#x27;t always make a good product, I have since learned).</li>
      <li>A friend of mine surprised me by sending me some of this product after commenting on how much she liked it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a strong perfume smell which may be offensive to some people, so if you are sensitive to strong smells and perfumes it may be too much for you.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have very dry skin in all seasons. I bought this because I was trying to find something more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; to use at night. I do not have sensitive skin, but this stings upon application. I used it for two weeks to see if I would get used to it, but the sting remained and I still woke up with very tight-feeling skin. It&#x27;s OK during the day layered under another lotion with SPF, but honestly I wouldn&#x27;t consider this a night cream. Also, if you do not like scented products: stay away! The scent is cloying and sticks around for a while.</li>
    <li> I am over 40 and do not like very many facial products on the market. I have dry skin and my face sweats and turns red very easily. I have sensitive skin and I cannot even wear liquid base products let alone lotions. My best friend recommended this product after I asked her why she looked so much different after not seeing her for a month.    The Yes to Carrots night cream is amazing (this is my very favorite of all their products). My skin looked 5 years younger in just 3 days of use. If you wanted to try one of the products first, the night cream is the one. I also use the Yes to Carrots facial exfoliating cream, Yes to Carrots Day time facial cream, and Yes to Carrots eye cream (also one of my very favorite products). Today I am now using the body lotion and so far I am just as pleased as with all of the other products.    These Night cream and the Day cream are very thick, but this is misleading, because they soak very nicely into my skin. My fine lines are less noticeable already after just a few days and my skin feels younger and tighter. They eye cream has made the skin around my eyes more even-toned and less puffy (dark rings are less noticeable even though this is not suppose to be one of the corrective actions).     The exfoliation facial cleanser is very gentle. My face feels moisturized just from using that product. Believe me, I forget lotion a lot and my face still felt smooth and not dry from just the cleanser.    I have recommended this product to some co-workers and was able to tell within 3-4 days when they started using this product without even asking. Very Sun damaged skin on one of my co-workers was immediately better. She absolutely loves them as well.     If you have Oily skin, they have Yes to Tomatoes, and for normal skin, they have Yes to Cucumbers.    I will be a user of all of the Yes to Carrots for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine surprised me by sending me some of this product after commenting on how much she liked it. I&#x27;m 28 and have combination skin - I tend to break out when I don&#x27;t have enough moisture. I also spend a lot of time outdoors in the wind and sun. As someone who has been through the gamut of drugstore brands and also invested in very high end expensive creams, I have to say that this product is a winner. It can feel a little heavy when first applied but absorbs well within five minutes. I&#x27;m not one to make exuberant claims that it&#x27;s restored by face to pre-pubescent flawless glory, but I have noticed (as has my husband) a tangible change in both the texture and brightness of my skin. Additionally, I haven&#x27;t broken out in the two months since I&#x27;ve been using it. I&#x27;ve never left a product review but I&#x27;ve had such success with this one that I was compelled to. Looking forward to trying other products in the line.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t receive what was pictured. I seem to have received a product that is similar to this but it looks like it is their old brand. The jar isn&#x27;t even similar. Very disappointed. Because I absolutely love this product and they are discontinuing it and I thought that I found it. But I guess not.</li>
    <li> I bought this in a grocery store during an attempt (failed!) to spend less on facial products. It was really cheap, although once I opened it I saw the packaging made it seem bigger (1.7 oz - duh!). I used it most nights for a few weeks, and found that it was Just Okay. My face was still a little sticky in the morning, which was troublesome. It doesn&#x27;t sink in very well. Also, after weeks of use I didn&#x27;t see any softening or improvement in my skin. After 2 months I realized that the scent in it was giving me headaches - I had grown allergic to it! This makes sense to me, because all cheap grocery and drug store products have cheap chemically-created scents to which I become allergic. Try Murad products - worth the money. I am suspicious of the (currently) other review giving 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This product gave me an allergic reaction the first night I used it. It made my face break out. I love their condition but would not recommend the night cream.</li>
    <li> Yes to Carrots Moisturizing Night/Day Cream is such a wonderful product! I have been using it on a daily basis for over 2 years now and the only product I trust on my face beside the makeup I use. I give the product itself 5 stars and overall a 4 because it is too pricey. I go through the containers about every month to month and half maybe two which can add up to be almost 30 in store. I just buy it through amazon or ebay and it seems to be much cheaper! I would recommend this product to any one with normal to dry skin- probably wouldn&#x27;t work well with sensitive skin. I used to have really bad break outs and after I started using Y2C I noticed a BIG difference in my break outs- less redness and not lasting as long. This product smells amazing and you don&#x27;t have to use that much for all over your face an neck! The one con I did notice is that when I put this product on alone without any makeup on top and go outside, it makes my face start to sweat but with makeup it doesn&#x27;t do that- weird! But overall GREAT product and a MUST have!!!</li>
    <li> Just another cream that works ok. Don&#x27;t worry !&lt;br /&gt;Better ones out there !</li>
    <li> Moisturizing properties? So far, it worked fine for my eczema-prone skin. The smell was so bad, however, that I&#x27;m debating on going back to my old moisturizer, which is sad because this cream seems promising. I might take one last shot and try and mix some essential oils into it to cover up the smell, but it really smells bad.</li>
    <li> Love this product! If you have very dry skin then this is the cream for you! It is thick and leaves you skin very soft the next day. This truly is for dry skin because it can get a little greasy but overall I am very pleased with Yes to Carrots&#x27; products!! Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> i got this on sale at the store.  It has really made my skin softer and does not make me get oily skin.  I use it for my face after a daily face scrub.  The sent I thought was fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Yes to Carrots Night Cream for about a year now because I love it.  My skin is smoother and more refreshed than ever before.</li>
    <li> This product is very fragranced. I was unable to use it more than once. Why does the cosmetic industry think that every thing needs to be purfumed?</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and am alergic to fragrance so must have a natural, frangrace free product for my dry skin.  This product was represented as containing completely natural incredients beginning with carrots and even including sweet potatoes.  So, imagine my surprise to read \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; on the label.  And it&#x27;s not a pleasant natural scent, but strong perfume!  It&#x27;s too much trouble to send back but I will not order such products again from Amazon unless I am able to access the COMPLETE ingredients list.</li>
    <li> I suffer from dry skin and this has helped me. I use it as a day and night cream in during the winter months and only a night cream when the weather is warmer. It has a slight smell, which is nice and not overpowering. The ingredients are decent, not perfect, but much safer than most store bought creams. The only other products I use on my face are unrefined pure Shea butter and 100% pure Argan oil. The three products together have been showing great improvements in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s btw.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream regularly for a month and I have noticed remarkable changes in my skin. It is very hydrating. This is probably my favorite product in this line and my skin feels wonderful and smooth. I have nothing negative to say about this cream. I will definitely order it again. I have normal to dry skin and am in my early thirties in case this info helps...</li>
    <li> I will be buying this again. I have sensitive skin, with psoriasis in some areas, and find this product to be gently moisturizing, and nonirritating. It has a light clean odour, lovely texture, and the price is very competitive.</li>
    <li> The product came with a dark smudge on one side of the tub, after digging it out I only had about 1/2 to 2/3rds of the cream left.</li>
    <li> After using this product and having a skin reaction to it, I looked online to read reviews and noticed that MANY other people were saying the same thing had happened to them: their skin got very red and hot and they had to wash it off immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly sensitive skin, but I thought this product would be alright because it contained many natural ingredients (natural ingredients don&#x27;t always make a good product, I have since learned). However, some reviews I&#x27;ve been reading about the skin reactions have been by people who say they have normal, non-sensitive skin. After immediately washing this moisturizer off and cooling my face with a cold washcloth, I put Aveeno body lotion on my face and it went back to normal. I usually use Aveeno on my face at night but wanted to give this product a try. If you are thinking of switching to this moisturizer, DON&#x27;T DO IT.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t find it moisturizing enough for my older skin.  But I&#x27;ll use it and keep looking for the perfect match of moisturizer and my skin.</li>
    <li> Love this Cream!  I have very dry skin on my face during the winter months.  I have tried so many products including Mary Kay, Neutrogena, Arbonne, Etc with no success.  Whatever I tried my skin was still really dry and I was sick of spending money on products that did not work.  My brother had mentioned to me that he had tried the Yes to Blueberries lotion with sun block and liked the product so I checked out Amazon.  I found the Yes to Carrots and decided to try one more cream.  I am so happy I did.  This lotion has been amazing.  My skin has not been dry all winter!  I have never used a lotion that was so nourishing for my face. My skin looks and feels so much better.  I think this product is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Good product. It makes dry skin look nourished and moisturized. I just don&#x27;t like the plastic packaging. Under high temperature it may affect the product qualities. Company should invest in glass packaging.</li>
    <li> Combined with the Yes To Tomatoes face moisturizer its perfect! Completely obsessed. I would not go back after trying the Yes to Line  !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product off and on for a while.  Smells sort of medicine-y which the other half doesn&#x27;t like so much. I primarily use it in the winter since its really dry here and I need the extra help.  I alternate with an argon oil.  Definitely thick and creamy so be careful not to get it clumped up by using too much.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but I&#x27;ve gone back to Oil of Olay. I thought maybe it would make me look 10 years younger (I&#x27;m 64) but alas, the wrinkles are still there. Oh well. I&#x27;ve earned them:)</li>
    <li> Just discovered this product.  It is creamy without being greasy. I put it on most nights. The other nights I use Alpha Hydroxy lotion.</li>
    <li> excellent face cream....makes a big difference&lt;br /&gt;easy to apply if you cleanse your face and leave it slightly damp - goes on quickly &amp; evenly&lt;br /&gt;My favorite!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I really like how it feels on my skin. I use it at night after I wash my face. I have been breaking out a lot lately so I&#x27;ve been using a benzoyle wash in the mornings. This dries out my skin so I like to use a milder wash in the evenings and this night cream at night. I like that it has the repairing benefit and is natural as well.</li>
    <li> It is a great thick cream that I like best for the winter when my skin gets really dry.  Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> My mom is the one who ordered this on my account so I cant really say how great it is but she seems to like it for her turkey neck so 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I am in my 20s and have very dry skin that is also quite acne prone which makes shopping for a moisturizer a bit challenging. This night cream does a great job moisturizing my face and does not cause me to break out at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a strong perfume smell which may be offensive to some people, so if you are sensitive to strong smells and perfumes it may be too much for you. I was surprised by the smell at first, but quickly got used to it and it does not bother me.</li>
    <li> This night cream feels very heavy and somewhat greasy. Unless you have very dry winter skin, I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t make my skin as hydrated as I would have liked, thought I love that it is natural and loving to animals.</li>
    <li> Great lotion. Not greasy. Slight cooling sensation with use. Great price (beats the pharmacy prices)</li>
    <li> The first time I tried this I was a little afraid because I had never heard of it. But since my skin was so dry from the winter weather in Seattle, I thought, \\&quot;What do I have to lose my skin is in desperate need of anything.\\&quot; When I got it, I used it before going to bed. I woke up the next morning to find that my skin was super soft and looked like I had just gone to the spa. Since summer weather is upon us now, I have switch my daily moisturizer to \\&quot;Yes to Tomatoes\\&quot; as well as my face wash because my skin tends to get oily this time of year. But I do still use the \\&quot;Yest to Carrots\\&quot; night cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I&#x27;m of Thai/Loas descent and it works great for me.</li>
    <li> This night cream is wonderful. It instantly smooths skin and makes it look younger. It&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs quickly leaving skin soft. I cant use many night creams because i break out easily, but i can use this stuff. I can tell the diffrence in my face the mornings after i use it as opposed to the nights i dont. As for the comment about fragrence... it has a very light clean scent... smells like it&#x27;s a natural scent and not added to the product. Bought it many times. I&#x27;ve also tryed yes to tomatoes facemask.. cucumbers moisturiser and blueberries clenser. This brand is great!</li>
    <li> OMG, Worse experience ever. I nearly had a panic attack from this stuff. I got it at TJ max, thats why it was like 2 bucks! :(</li>
    <li> Great product. Not to thin or too thick. Love it a lot. As good as the expensive stuff. Wonderful value.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m a little disappointed with this product. Basically, I read reviews on this and most of them said they had improvement in their skin condition and complexion so I bought this hoping that I would notice the same. Maybe the people that noticed improvement in their skin tone and complexion must have had pretty noticable issues with their skin to begin with or something (I mean no offense to anyone) because I&#x27;ve been using this religiously for a little over a month and I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my skin what-so-ever. I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars, however, because 1) I like that it is 98% natural and paraben-free, and 2) it doesn&#x27;t actually say anywhere that this product is supposed to \\&quot;improve skin tone or complexion\\&quot;; what it says is that it is good for dry skin, and if I had had dry skin to begin with, I can see how this would moisturize well but my main reason for buying this wasn&#x27;t for dry skin. I read that it is good to start on a skin care regimen early (I&#x27;m 25) to slow the signs of aging, and I just assumed that the extra moisture and the vitamin E might make some sort of difference. Although, I can&#x27;t really tell if my skin is considered badly toned or complected anyway but I do have a few old acne spots here and there that I was hoping would even up, maybe less noticeable pores, and that maybe I might notice a radiance or brightness....nothing.&lt;br /&gt;From my perspective, if all you want is something that will keep your face from drying out, then this is for you. If you&#x27;re looking for something that will have some sort of noticeable effect on your skin, try something else.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing and has a nice, neutral smell. It is heavy enough though that it should be used only at night.</li>
    <li> Using this product resulted in my face becoming bright red and I experienced an intense stinging sensation. As a result I must avoid this product line entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m currently in the process of attempting to determine what ingredient caused such a violent reaction when I&#x27;ve used a variety of lotion and have never had this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product for the natural approach to a facial lotion as a way to reduce sporadic acne and exceptional dryness. I also liked the packaging is easily recycled.</li>
    <li> This is a very good cream for night time. It&#x27;s a litle heavy, but t works very well and is non-irritating to the skin and has a pleasant smell.  Definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> very heavy and moisturizing but I only use it when my skin is super dry otherwise it breaks me out. I also cant use it nightly or it will break me out, which is a shame. I also find it to be kinda greasy</li>
    <li> This product leaves my skin soft and supple. It apply it generously every night, and every morning I wake up with my skin glowing and looking bright and clear. Some other moisturizers leave my face oily in the morning (it never fully soaks in) or too dry (it soaks in too fast and dries out), but this is PERFECT. Love love love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have normal to dry skin, and this is fabulous. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I always buy the carrot products when I find them.  Love, love them. This was a good deal on line. I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> The product itself is amazing. It nourishes the skin and you wake up with baby soft skin. There was a problem with Fedex delivery but the seller resolved it with no problem. Would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> Love the feel and smell.  Huge fan of the carrots products - just a little pricey to keep replenishing.  The face wash is my favorite though.</li>
    <li> I love this night cream! The smell is light, just a smidgen will cover your face and neck easily, and it leaves your skin feeling smooth. It absorbs quickly and does not leave your face feeling oily right before bed. Love it!</li>
    <li> I am usually very satisfied with the night cream, but the particular tub I received seemed old. It had a much greasier, more watery consistency, and it smelled old. It&#x27;s fine, but not up to par with it&#x27;s normal consistency.</li>
    <li> I starting using this product on my combination skin complete with dry patches and acne. The cream feels amazing and is instantly smoothing on the skin. My skin really does look radiant after just the first time using it, and has improved both with the acne and overall tone since i started using it (about 2 weeks ago). It has a very light and pleasant smell, and is paraben free!  The salicylic acid has also helped clear up my skin, which for me is a huge bonus for a night cream! I use many of the yes to cucumbers, blueberries and tomatoes line too and have really found them all to be great products, for a very reasonable price.  So glad I found this product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how all these 5-star reviewers could ignore the smell of this product. Ew! Though the main fragrance is not too offensive, although way too strong, there are some very bad smells underneath it that I think the strong scent is trying to mask. If you have a diminished sense of smell (or somehow just don&#x27;t mind it), the cream goes on nicely enough. Unfortunately for me, this is just another face cream for the bathroom shelf.</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing. My sister recommended this product line to me as we both have sensitive skin and are moving to organic products. This cream is amazing and its keeps my face moist without being oily. I don&#x27;t have any bad acne problems but the fall/winter months and hard water where I live take their toll on my face. I only use a little (that&#x27;s all you need) and my face is moist all night until the next night! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I get really bad facial eczema during the winter time. This stuff really helped to get rid of it and all the redness on my face. The first time I put it on it did sting a little, but it was well worth it for the end result. It also does not have a very pleasant smell. I don&#x27;t think it is particularly fragrant, just nasty lotion smell. Oh well!</li>
    <li> My face was red and irritating, like on fire after using this...but my husband was fine with this. I am using it on my feet now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Ponds Cold Cream for years, but decided to try this instead and I&#x27;m so glad I did. This  night cream works very well for dry skin without making your skin feel greasy. You can see a huge difference in your skins dryness after just one night. I have very sensitive skin and break out at the slightest provocation, so I&#x27;m always leery of trying new skin care products. This night cream does not cause my skin to break out, and doesn&#x27;t make it feel greasy. I will, not only continue using this, but will try other products in the Yes to Carrots line. Makes your skin feel nice and soft.</li>
    <li> This is a great night time cream. Your skin will love the great way it works on your skin, and knowing it is pure is so reassuring.</li>
    <li> While I cannot decide if I like the scent and mostly wish it had no scent at all, i really like this cream.  It goes on smooth and creamy.  I do not feel overloaded and my skin feels great in the mornings.</li>
