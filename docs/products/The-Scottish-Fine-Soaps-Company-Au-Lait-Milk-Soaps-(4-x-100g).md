    <li> I loved the feel of this soap on my skin, but the smell of the soup was so strong that it lingered all day and mixed with my perfume. (Let&#x27;s just say that was not a match made in heaven!) so while I wanted to love the soap and generally hold the product quality in high regard, it was not for me.</li>
    <li> Makes beautiful bubbles and leaves your skin so soft. Washes off and smells great. My face loves it!</li>

She expanded her horizons and did an internet search and purchased several additional items in the line.  While visiting her in Vail this fall, she gave me a bar of soap to try.

    <li> I received two 300g-size bars of these soaps as a gift a while back and fell in love with them. I tried finding them in stores and looked everywhere online for them.
