      <li>I have finished my jar and am buying more.</li>

      <li>EWG.ORG was so right on about this product :-)</li>
      <li>Noticed it working right away!</li>
      <li>It is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve used so far, and I&#x27;ve tried pretty much all the natural ones out there!</li>
      <li>It has a subtle but delicious smell.  </li>
      <li>I have tried some of the products from the aging line and dry skin line though and loved those too.</li>
      <li>Smells amazing and it gets a low toxicity rating by the EWG which was one of the reasons why I decided to try it.  </li>
      <li>This is for someone with naturally eve skin that just needs a healthy boost.</li>
      <li>I could see if you are older and looking for more intense moisture, andalou does make products designed for aging skin, and they also make products for dry/sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>My skin instantly felt amazing, and the next day looked brighter, clearer, and more even-toned.  </li>
      <li>Very reasonably priced moisturizer</li>
      <li>Very nice texture and fresh subtle smell.  </li>
      <li>jar lasted about 3 months, so good value overall if it is moisturizing enough for you.  </li>
      <li>It is thick but very easy to smooth on and doesn&#x27;t take very much at all so</li>
      <li>w/ ingredients that are pure, organic, not tested on animals, vegan...</li>
      <li>amazing and stretch marks are much, much more faint.  </li>
      <li>Even a finger-full can be too much for covering the face and the neck.  </li>
      <li>I am very glad I discovered an all natural product without all of the harsh chemicals.</li>
      <li>This product is not greasy, light on skin and hydrates dry areas.</li>
      <li>After trying many different brands I finally found Andalou Naturals.  </li>
      <li>I used it for a couple more nights and my skin felt powdery and tight.</li>
      <li>It has really helped to keep my combination skin clear.</li>
      <li>Was not expecting such a change in my skin because I actually have nice, except for the sun spots, even tone skin, to begin with and this cream brightened my skin to look as I did when I was much younger!</li>
      <li>I have normal to oily skin.</li>
      <li>The Purple Carrot Night Moisturizer completely eliminates it!  </li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>my skin looks completely refreshed by the morning!</li>
      <li>I also have a problem spot on the nuckle of my right thumb that becomes terribly dry to the point of cracking and bleeding.  </li>
      <li>I checked Purple Carrot&#x27;s ingredients list and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>This is not a heavy cream</li>
      <li>so this product line just isn&#x27;t for me and my sensitive</li>
      <li>It improves the appearance of my skin almost instantly, smells pleasing, and I like that it&#x27;s not incredibly thick.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and greasy or stinky like SO many other night creams I have used.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While I love the smell, grape-y, chianti-y, non-irritating (and I&#x27;m very sensitive to artificial fragrance), it does not provide as much moisture as I would expect for a night</li>
      <li>I usually have to apply a second pea-sized amount all over my face to feel comfortably moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>far as aiding with skin discoloration, I do not believe there is a noticeable difference, but I&#x27;m only 3 weeks in, so too soon for something like that to be visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Then the sides of my cheeks and temples are normal to dry.  </li>
      <li>And I have a light case of rosacea on my nose and along the sides of it which leave it slightly to very pink and with slightly thicker skin.  </li>
      <li>Since using the daily clesnser and moisturizers those are barely noticeable.  </li>
      <li>However, from the first use it made my skin feel strangely powdery and slightly stingy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is all natural &amp; so good for the skin. Everything you put on your body is absorbed into you system &amp; is processed by your liver so this is as good as it gets.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and texture of this night cream. It smells like tootsie rolls and feels like a whipped butter! It has really helped to keep my combination skin clear. I don&#x27;t know if I see a brightening effect just yet (2 weeks in), but I will continue to use it to see. I plan to also purchase other products in this line. I am very glad I discovered an all natural product without all of the harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> Best cream I&#x27;ve ever used! My skin looks amazing! EWG.ORG was so right on about this product :-)</li>
    <li> This made me break out.  I have normal to oily skin.</li>
    <li> This cream is not moisturizing enough to be called a night cream. It&#x27;s honestly not moisturizing enough period. This is for someone with naturally eve skin that just needs a healthy boost. I also felt my skin looked less radiant than the aloe vera cream I used before. I ended up switching back.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream on Amazon because I have heard from friends that Andalou makes good quality skin care. I needed a good night cream since I had run out of Arbonne RE9 night cream. I just can&#x27;t pay $65 (and that is with 35% discount) plus tax and shipping for  0.5oz any more and also Purple Carrot Plus C cream promised brightening, something that RE9 line does not deliver. I checked Purple Carrot&#x27;s ingredients list and was pleasantly surprised. Their ingredients are even better than Arbonne&#x27;s. After using this cream for a couple of weeks I can say that it makes my skin firmer and brighter, it adds glow. It also provides a perfect amount of moisture for my combination skin. There is no left over grease in the morning. It does not clog pores at all.</li>
    <li> I just used it yesterday, and it burned when I applied the lotion to my skin.  My face is red and dried today!  Terrible. And I shot commercials and TV shows, needless to say I&#x27;m mortified... Used anadalou prior never had this situation happen.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin.  Oily/acne pretty much down the center of my face from the outside corners of my eyes up and down.  Then the sides of my cheeks and temples are normal to dry.  And I have a light case of rosacea on my nose and along the sides of it which leave it slightly to very pink and with slightly thicker skin.  I bought this to complement with the clarifying night cream also by Anadlou Naturals and alternate nightly which cream I use.  My skin seems to do well with this practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the purple color.  It&#x27;s a lovely shade of lavender.  The smells is positively delightful.  I always take a deep breath every time I open the jar.  It smells wonderful.  A littler goes a very long way I have found.  Even a finger-full can be too much for covering the face and the neck.  Takes a little trial and error to figure out how little/much to put on your finger.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both use it nightly.  Lite weight, works great.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and I apply this at night and leaves my skin feeling refreshed.  It has a subtle but delicious smell.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I really love this night cream. It smells good and I have totally noticed a difference in my skin since using it for the past 3 weeks. It is thick but very easy to smooth on and doesn&#x27;t take very much at all so its going to last a long time. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and greasy or stinky like SO many other night creams I have used. I love the way my skin feels after I apply it at night and how my skin feels when I wake up. I am going to be sticking with this one.</li>
    <li> I have definitely noticed a difference in my skin since using this night cream.  This is not a heavy cream but it is easily absorbed and has a lovely light scent.  I have used other Andalou products and am now adding this to my list of Andalou favorites.</li>
    <li> I wont&#x27; be repurchasing this product.&lt;br /&gt;While I love the smell, grape-y, chianti-y, non-irritating (and I&#x27;m very sensitive to artificial fragrance), it does not provide as much moisture as I would expect for a night cream.&lt;br /&gt;I have also been using the matching toner; I apply this cream while my face is still damp, and within 5 minutes begin to feel tight again.  I usually have to apply a second pea-sized amount all over my face to feel comfortably moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as aiding with skin discoloration, I do not believe there is a noticeable difference, but I&#x27;m only 3 weeks in, so too soon for something like that to be visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to update at the end of the jar before replacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE*** 2.18.13&lt;br /&gt;This jar lasted about 3 months, so good value overall if it is moisturizing enough for you.  I never did notice any fading associated with this product.  Will not repurchase.  I WAS happy with the *quality* of this product, though, so am trying their probiotic cream this time.</li>
    <li> Amazing moisturizer!  After trying many different brands I finally found Andalou Naturals.  This goes on smooth and leaves my face radient.  Due to an illness, I have slight imperfections on both cheeks.  Since using the daily clesnser and moisturizers those are barely noticeable.  I also have a problem spot on the nuckle of my right thumb that becomes terribly dry to the point of cracking and bleeding.  I used all kinds of lotions but nothing helped.  The Purple Carrot Night Moisturizer completely eliminates it!  I also use it as a daily moisturizer on the backs of my hands, as they begin to show some age, and on my outer thighs where I have slight stretch marks.  Hands look amazing and stretch marks are much, much more faint.  Truly has healing properties.  Also had a skin break out on upper arm due to food allergies.  Weeks went by before I began apply the night moisturizer.  Wow!  Massive improvement by the next morning.  I now only use Andalou Naturals for all of my skin care as,well as hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they would make Purple Carrot in a larger size since it is great for much more than just the face.  Hope they never change the formula!</li>
    <li> Very reasonably priced moisturizer and it has great ingredients.  NO harmful stuff.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and it gets a low toxicity rating by the EWG which was one of the reasons why I decided to try it.  A little goes a long way so I think it will last a long time as well.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> To start, I have normal to combination The smell was ok and product has good ingredients. However, from the first use it made my skin feel strangely powdery and slightly stingy. I used it for a couple more nights and my skin felt powdery and tight. By the fourth day my face was dry and my skin was flaking. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again but it seems like it worked well for other reviewers.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. It smells great and does not leave my skin looking oily or feeling oily at all. I have only been using it a couple weeks and have definitely seen added moisture in my skin. The dry, cold weather had dried me out. I can&#x27;t say yet if I see any improvement otherwise, but I am hopeful.</li>
    <li> The best night cream I have ever used!  It goes on light and my skin looks completely refreshed by the morning!</li>
    <li> I was visiting my sister and she had this cream, so I tried some.  My skin instantly felt amazing, and the next day looked brighter, clearer, and more even-toned.  I loved it so much that I stole (well, with her permission took) it from her!  I am reordering.  It is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve used so far, and I&#x27;ve tried pretty much all the natural ones out there!</li>
    <li> Noticed it working right away! I have some sun damage and it actually repaired my skin. This is a brightening cream and not overly oily as you may think a night cream might be. I am not the type to ever think a lotion is going to work magic but liked that this product has \\&quot;fruit stem cell science\\&quot; w/ ingredients that are pure, organic, not tested on animals, vegan...I am amazed at the results! Was not expecting such a change in my skin because I actually have nice, except for the sun spots, even tone skin, to begin with and this cream brightened my skin to look as I did when I was much younger! I have finished my jar and am buying more.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It improves the appearance of my skin almost instantly, smells pleasing, and I like that it&#x27;s not incredibly thick. I could see if you are older and looking for more intense moisture, andalou does make products designed for aging skin, and they also make products for dry/sensitive skin. I am a young adult with combination skin and the brightening line is what works best. I have tried some of the products from the aging line and dry skin line though and loved those too. This company just produces good quality skin care.</li>
    <li> Moisturizers, especially night creams, cause me to break out. This product is not greasy, light on skin and hydrates dry areas. I even used during daytime with sunscreen and did not break out. Also has nice scent. I have also used the Andalou Resveratrol Q10 Night Repair Cream and it works great too.</li>
    <li> Very nice texture and fresh subtle smell.  Goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> I have used this about 4 days now and I have to say I am disappointed. It smells wonderful. It goes on nicely. In the morning I am a flaky itchy bumpy mess. I also feel my face is &#x27;burned.&#x27; Not at all what one would expect from a brightening night cream.&lt;br /&gt;I also had the same reaction to their brightening eye cream so this product line just isn&#x27;t for me and my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;--update-- I realized this package was unsealed - not even a sticker to close the box or plastic covering the jar. It did not look used. Maybe a return? company refused to return my product.</li>
