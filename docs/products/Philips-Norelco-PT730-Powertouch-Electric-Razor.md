<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the workhorse of the electric razors. Bought it to replace my 10 yr old Norelco that finally died after I dropped it one too many times.&lt;br /&gt;It s much lighter and quieter then the old model, so at first I felt like it is cheap/flimsy. It is anything but that. It is a light, well made razor, that is quiet and has a really long battery life. I think I&#x27;ve only charged it once in almost 2 months of use.&lt;br /&gt;i also like the improvement in the head/blade removal - it is hinged, so I wont drop it into a trash can ever again trying to shake the stubble out.&lt;br /&gt;I hope it lasts as long as my old one did!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my dad, he loves it.</li>
    <li> really does not cut the hair with out burns on my face</li>
    <li> Husband researched and bought this on the so called &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; reviews and after 6 mo. or so hates it. I used it a coup[le of times too remove my faint but over 50 mustache (thanks old age). It bit the corner of my mouth both times and I hate it too. Husband says it does a terrible job and he has to go over the same areas again and again.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it !</li>
    <li> This was the lousiest electric razor I&#x60;ve ever owned- it fell apart shortly after I bought it.</li>
    <li> nice close shave and for an economical price</li>
    <li> Excellent electric razor and easy an the wallet I am balding and it tackles the task of getting the shave close whether it be head hair or face hair it handles the job. This is the only electric razor I have found that&#x27;s up to the challenge.  At any where close to the price.</li>
    <li> Very lightly made compared with the older Norelcos but that&#x27;s probably a tribute to the Norelco engineering team to redesign and lower the manufacturing costs. I have nothing to rave about nor complain either. It shaves just fine...</li>
    <li> Works well &amp; does the job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase, the shaver is quiet, smooth (does not pinch), and gives a very good shave. It is also very stylish, waterproof, cordless, and affordable.</li>
    <li> I am a long-term user of Norelco shavers and , having now used it fo a couple of weeks, the blades have adjusted to give me a shave better than any other electric shaver I have owned. Even a died-in-the wool razor addict would have little to complain about. Mind you there is the break-in phase to be aware of; give the Norelco a chance to break in and it will serve you well indeed.</li>
    <li> This is for my dad to buy , my father liked it very much . It shave very clean, and not much sound . My father uses it every day .&lt;br /&gt;Now, he don&#x27;t be worried about the rapid growth of beard</li>
    <li> easy to clean with water and functioning well.</li>
    <li> Used ths Norelco to replace a Remington and much closer shave with Norelco.  Quieter, easier to clean, better bang for the buck.</li>
    <li> Honestly I am disappointed with this electric razor after having used it for a month. It&#x27;s not that it does not shave but the problem is that it is not a very powerful razor and for a person like me with not a lot of facial hair, I HAVE TO SPEND 15-20 MINUTES IN ORDER TO GET A CLOSE SHAVE. Also, I have to press the razor very hard on my face in order to shave the stubble AND IT LEAVES MY SKIN FEELING LIKE I SHAVED WITH SANDPAPER. Even my old shaver which was half the price of this new one used to do a better and faster job in half the time. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT FOR THOSE FELLAS WITH A LOT OF FACIAL HAIR. The only positive features are that it stays charged long, the trimmer feature works well, it&#x27;s light for carrying when traveling and it&#x27;s easy to clean. I do not want to go through the trouble of returning it, but next time I will definitely invest my money on a better electric shaver even if it&#x27;s a more expensive one. THAT&#x27;S MY ADVICE FOR ALL OF YOU GENTLEMEN THAT ARE CONSIDERING TO BUY THIS PARTICULAR PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I have used it less than 5 times and use the cover that comes with it, so it doesn&#x27;t get dinged up. Yet, I am already getting ready marks all over my neck without even pushing that hard. They last most of the day too, so I can&#x27;t use it in the morning before work anymore.</li>
    <li> I gave this a five star because of the great shave it gives and because it is very quiet.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver October 2013. I&#x27;ve had no problems with it until two days ago. It suddenly wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I had recharged it the day before so that can&#x27;t be it. but I plugged in the charger cable anyway and I was able to turn it on. When I finished shaving it wouldn&#x27;t turn off. Two minutes later I was able to turn it off. With the charger cable removed I tried turning it on and off again. That worked. I tried on again, nope, had to plug in the charger cable it wouldn&#x27;t turn off. It&#x27;s been some variation of the same confusing cycle for two days. At this price point it&#x27;s a throw away item. I&#x27;ve ordered another model.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this thing to shave pretty much everything. Works great. Maintains a charge for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean and sees to be fine if I soak the bladed parts in alcohol for a little while.</li>
    <li> I would buy this item again. It makes shaving as easy and close without irritation. Thanks Amazon for another excellent product.</li>
    <li> MY OLD UNIT JUST WORE OUT AFTER 15 YEARS OF GOOD SERVICE.THE NEW ONE WORKS JUST FINE.I WILL BUY A SPARE SET OF HEADS IN THE FUTURE.</li>
    <li> Great shaver for the value. I have sensitive skin &amp; other shavers have irritated my skin. This shaver gave me a close shave and did not leave a rash or irritation. Pop up trimmer is good for trimming side burns &amp; mustache.</li>
    <li> My requirements are basic.  Give me a close shave.  I do not want to use it in the shower.  I do not want it to squirt lubricant.  Just cut my facial hair.  It does that.  Done deal.</li>
    <li> Seems underpowered, but provides the best shave ever.  I&#x27;ve been using Norelco razors since 1979.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a Sensor Excel blade and nothing else for about twenty years.  When I was a teen, I tried once or twice my father&#x27;s ancient electric which was awful (even he barely ever had used it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got tired of the mess of the blade and wanted to try an electric, but I wasn&#x27;t prepared to spend a lot of money on this experiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all.  The instructions say give it three weeks minimum to adjust to the new system.  They&#x27;re serious.  My first few shaves were very discouraging, slow, uncomfortable, uneven, and I was left with red irritated skin under my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried various pre-shaves and aftershaves. By three weeks, I saw large improvements, but I still wasn&#x27;t sure.  It&#x27;s seven weeks, now, and I&#x27;m very impressed.  I get a quick close and comfortable shave, and It&#x27;s still improving.  I&#x27;m glad I made the switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - I only shave twice a week&lt;br /&gt; - My whiskers are pretty coarse and heavy&lt;br /&gt; - I settled on soaking my face with hot water then applying liquid hand soap as my pre-shave routine.  It works really well to make the razor glide over my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - I use Bulldog After shave Balm but am feeling the need for it less and less(I hadn&#x27;t used aftershave almost ever with the blade)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now ten weeks, and I gave up on this razor.  The comfort is good, and, I can get a very close shave, but it takes 20 minutes.  I don&#x27;t have the patience.  I&#x27;m ordering a Braun foil shaver.  I hope it can handle the stubble better.</li>
    <li> Great quality!  Doesn&#x27;t pull hair, gives nice shave.</li>
    <li> I had a Norelco 7140 earlier, and that stopped working after being used for over 4 years. This was the replacement, and I think it works a bit better than the previous one that I had. It&#x27;s definitely lighter, and the battery life is great. I have been using it for about 3 weeks right now on a single charge, and it&#x27;s still going strong and shaving well. The washability is a nice feature too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update July 2014 ** 1 year on, and it&#x27;s still going great after being used daily. I guess the battery life may be down to about 2 weeks instead of the 3 weeks I wrote originally, but otherwise just like new.</li>
    <li> I like that it runs longer between charges. An earlier model that I had for years, the charge did not last as long. I still get the great shave I expected with this model too.</li>
    <li> My bad ...... you buy cheap; you get cheap. Should have spent a little more for their best razor. The old adage &amp;#34;you get what you paid for&amp;#34; comes to mind.</li>
    <li> My Norelco arrived 2 days earlier than the estimated date which was a welcome surprise. I have not used an electric shaver since the 70&#x27;s when I received one as a gift. Apparently, the technology from those days just didn&#x27;t cut the mustard and I was back to using a blade just a few short months later. I had never really considered going back to an electric shaver until I was forced to undergo carotid artery surgery which left a nasty scar from my jawbone to near my collarbone. I can&#x27;t express the challenge of trying to get a blade close to that sensitive area not to mention I suffered some nerve damage on the surrounding scar tissue as well, adding to the painful task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading through many of the reviews on a number of different Norelco models, I settled with this particular razor and I can&#x27;t tell you enough of how pleased I am with my purchase. This PT730 actually shaves better than a blade and those tough areas are now a breeze to whisk over. I&#x27;ve gone for several days without a shave and this model does not discriminate against the length of the whiskers. The added pop-up trimmer is very efficient in trimming my sideburns and moustache to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the instruction booklet discusses a break-in period and possible facial irritation during the adjustment time, I have not been affected in the least and there is no pulling effect felt at all, just a smooth comfortable shave. Clean up is a snap and the convenience of cordless operation makes this Norelco a product I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about you but my electric razors seem to last three or four years and then it&#x27;s time to toss them. This is the case for the replacement I currently and. It was almost identical to this new one. The batteries would not hold their charge and as one knows replacing any parts in this type razor cost more than a new one. Even the rotary blades wills et you back almost as much as a new razor. I researched all of the Norelco razor and found you can spend a lot of money for the upper end models. Im opted to stay closest to the bottom and just continue to tossing them as they wear out. This one does a good job of shaving mainly because the unit and the blades are still new.i</li>
    <li> I have had norelco&#x27;s in the past.  This razor lives up to  the expectations I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, the razor is extremely quiet.  It holds a good charge.&lt;br /&gt;Highly satisfied!</li>
    <li> United Airlines had my luggage, which someone rifled through and stole my 10 year old Norelco razor, of all things. I replaced it at my own cost, this was the least expensive one Amazon had, I guess you get what you pay for....</li>
    <li> This is a decent enough product for the price, but it doesn&#x27;t give a shave as close as a razor.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really compare it to other electric razors, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t cut as close as a manual one. However, once you get used to tightening your skin as you go around I&#x27;d say it does a good job. I wanted to go electric because I was tired of having to buy replacement heads so often; furthermore, it seemed like my skin was getting irritated. With this one I feel like it gets the job done without the irritation. Sometimes I have to go over areas a few times before it cuts the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to point out that the cover for the blade broke off one of it&#x27;s attachment pieces very early on, though I don&#x27;t remember how I managed to do that, maybe I put it on incorrectly and tried to force it.</li>
    <li> As allways the best razor brand available. With normal care this razor will last thru at least two sets of cutting heads.</li>
    <li> Its my first electric razor, however i cant have a decent shave with this one, i prefer the classic razors like the gillette ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldnt recomend this product.</li>
    <li> Norelco razor they are very good product  I have owed a few in the pass years . works great gives a good shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found this product to be much better than my old foil shaver.  Sure it&#x27;s more bulky with the 3 rotating blades but I find it does get quite a nice shave...just not as close as my foil shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The ability to run it under water clears out the blades and such easily however I find it hard to dry so I tend to use a brush and compressed air before all that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Run time is more than enough, didn&#x27;t even have to charge it while I was on vacation for 6 days and even then, I didn&#x27;t pass 50% use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great little shaver for the price, although I think the wet/dry model would have been a slightly better choice...just more money for that.</li>
    <li> I use this razor daily which replaced a Norelco 6863XL At the time I thought there was nothing better than the 6863XL which I and a local small appliance repair shop struggled with to keep it running. Finally, parts were no longer available and I was forced to move on to a replacement razor. After careful research and  reading of reviews, I thought I would try the PT730. Initially, the PT 730 seemed to me as running slow. However, when I got used to the razor and my beard settled in with it, it&#x27;s undoubtedly the best razor I have used in years. For the cost coupled with the ease of cleaning the unit, you just cannot beat it! Highly recommend it!! .</li>
    <li> Husband disappointed with performance, had better quality razor that broke, replaced with this model, noticed immediately that this razor was inferior, wont buy again.</li>
    <li> This shaver is reasonably well built, and the power cord is nice and long. However it simply doesn&#x27;t do what it should: shave closely / consistently. Even after I carefully go over my chin several times with it, I still have odd patches of hair that it missed. Granted I do have heavy stubble, but regardless this works far less well than other brands I have owned in the past. Do not recommend if you want consistent results.</li>
    <li> So much easier to use than a manual razor.  Your face does have to be dry for best results.  I do wish it could prop straight up though.... other than that, great product!  Does the job very well!</li>
    <li> My previous shavers have always been norelco but this one does the best as I have neck places that have curly close hairs.  I think it&#x27;s due to the various slot types and configuration of the shaver head.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using norelco since the  company first starting making them.  Not many products have that kind of track record.&lt;br /&gt;  DOOFUS</li>
    <li> They keep getting lighter, but still the same great shave I have come to appreciate from Norelco lots of features at a low price.</li>
    <li> Best thing ever invented for shaving.</li>
    <li> EXCELENT PRODUCT,PRICE AND SERVICE</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this model for a year now and am still very impressed.  For the price it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> good product and fairly priced</li>
    <li> Nice product with the built in trimmer!</li>
    <li> Gives a good shave but takes many passes in all directions to get all the hair. Otherwise I like this shaver.</li>
    <li> This razor gives an extremely smooth shave. The quality of shaving is noticeably better than my older model, Philips Norelco 7310, even though I hadn&#x27;t had the 7310 for very long at all (less than 6 months). I am convinced that, in this case, the newer model product is indeed better (but slightly more expensive as of Feb 2012).</li>
    <li> This Helps! Thank You for Your Service.</li>
    <li> Pretty much like any of the other Norelco Razors. Nothing special but still a good product. Getting what you pay for.</li>
    <li> The razor is very smooth and light . It charges very quickly and keeps a charge for at least a month. I have had the razor for  6 weeks and had to charge it once.  I have  had Phillips Norelco razors for around 20 years and will always use them.</li>
    <li> I bought it to give my family. Altough i haven&#x27;t opened it, I think it is a very good gift. Looks good with high quality.</li>
    <li> Replaved my old Norelco (rechargeable #3) after many years.  Almost as cheap as buying replacemebnt cutters and updated haed design lets this cut close in fewer passes and cleans under the tap on hot!  Great purchase - totally happy after months of use.  I expect it will last for 4-5 years like my other Norelco(s) did.</li>
    <li> I bought a PT730 after seeing excellent reviews for it in Amazon and it has not disappointed me. I earlier owned a Braun series 3 390cc and had a horrible experience with it. The pinching and the cuts I experienced with it made me give up hope on electric shavers altogether. I had a feeling I was raking grass on a lawn whenever I used the Braun shaver. But the experience with PT730 is altogether different. I have a very rough beard that grows pretty fast, yet with a fully grown beard the performance of this shaver is amazing. Gentle effortless rotations on the beard with PT730 is enough for a smooth shave. The shaving experience itself is quite amazing, easy on the skin and absolutely no pinching or cuts.</li>
    <li> It works absolutely fine.</li>
    <li> For the money, this razor is an excellent value. It gives a nice smooth shave without discomfort and the charge lasts for weeks.</li>
    <li> Previous model built better.</li>
    <li> LUV IT WORKS GREAT HOLDS LONG CHARGE FAST SHIPPING</li>
    <li> Have used it daily for 6 months.  Really like it.</li>
    <li> works just as advertised and easily cleans.  it does take some getting used to, going from a razer or foil.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers for many years, generally buying a new model when time to replace blades.  sorry to say, this new PT730 just is not giving me the close shave I am accustomed to......</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Great item. Love it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave as close to the skin as I like...but still an OK deal for the money...&lt;br /&gt;next level would be a razor</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the most expensive shaver but it gets the job done very well.  It&#x27;s a replacement for a similar Norelco model that had simply worn out.  Can&#x27;t say for sure but this new one seems to have a more powerful motor.  Smooth, close shave is what I was looking for and this one delivers.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> First Norelco shaver and I do like the way it shaves my face.  Evenly and it cuts to the skin and does not irritate my skin.  Easy to use and to clean and it says I don&#x27;t have to replace the razors for a year.</li>
    <li> It shaves perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is easy!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t need a charger! ( I mean that it lasts for toooo long)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need the back razor a-lot, you may not like it.</li>
    <li> The razor arrived on time.  It&#x27;s easy to use.  The motor isn&#x27;t particularly powerful, but it does the job fine.  And the trimmer is useful.  All in all, it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I had high expectations for this machine. In the end, I think buying a regular shaver may do the trick and possibly be less painful. This machine does the job, but it pulls your hairs and you need to constantly rub the same place to get a good clean cut. You will still need a razor, so don&#x27;t throw them away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it was ok. At least I will not spend too much money on razors.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a similar one, which had ceased functioning. I get a good shape and the flexibility help  maneuver around the jaw and neck. I would not recommend this for a person who has a heavy beard.</li>
    <li> This was my first Norelco and I was very pleased with the performance. My old Braun was noisy and dull in comparison to this product. I will buy another when this unit wears out.</li>
    <li> I have had good luck with Norelco razors.  This one has a &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; power cord than the prior (no problems with it in the first 6 months) but a major improvement in the fact that you can wash it under a faucet.</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver about 9 months now. I needed to replace my old Norelco Spectra razor which, unfortunately, died.  I wanted a razor that did not cost hundreds of dollars, after all, all I wanted was a decent shave. ( I didn&#x27;t need to impress myself with a fancy, expensive one.)  I also wanted one that was as easy to clean and maintain and did not require monthly $$ for this and that.  I like the triple head concept of the old Norelco and the shave it gave, but I decided to try a moderately priced Braun, just for a change.  After a few shaves, I sent it back.  It was like trying to shave with a 2x4 in your hand. Plus, the shaving felt dangerous.  Anyway, I compared all Noreclo models in this class and their reviews and chose the PT730.  Having used it for a number of months, here&#x27;s what I have discovered for MY shaving.&lt;br /&gt;  Pros:  Light and fairly quiet. Better than the old Spectra.  Shaves close enough if you give it time and patience.  Convenient to clean, and this is what I really like the most about it. You just pop the head up, put it under running water, shake it off, and you are done til next time.  I &#x27;d buy it again just based on this, maybe.&lt;br /&gt;  Cons:  Feels too light and cheap.  The Spectra felt solid, like it would last.  The shave takes a lot of patience and reruns, pulling the face, coming back, and mowing it down. It only takes about 4 minutes per shave, but I get impatient having to redo and redo facial areas.  It seems the old Spectra shaved no closer, but was quicker.  Finally, the razor just does not seem to have enough power to really do the job in less time. It charges fine, but after the first two shaves, you are always wondering if the recharge light is going to come on soon.  After a week of shaves, you wonder if it will get you through the shave.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a decent shaver.  If you have a heavy beard, (mine is probably medium),  patience is a requirement to own this little face mower.  I really like its convenience, but I am notsure if I would buy it again. I just wish Noreclo had a shaver in this class with a little MORE POWER.</li>
    <li> Good razor if you can get it on sale.  Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the head pops open when I travel causing the captured hair to go all over my travel bag.</li>
    <li> If I were to purchase another electric shaver, I would have spent a little more money on a different one. My experience with this one has not been too great. Often I go over the same spot several times which will irritate my skin and leave redness. At the time I spent around 50 dollars to purchase this shaver. Pros; it does shave for the most part, fairly easy to clean, long battery life. Cons; I consider the shaver to be big, misses hairs, irritates skin. Yes even after long term use. I am out of the return period or I would send it back. It is just collecting dust now.</li>
    <li> My birthday present from my son for the past several years has been his getting a haircut and a shave.  That&#x27;s right, once a year, whether he needs it or not.  Through the winter he looks like a cross between a mountain man and a yeti.  I ordered this razor for him with a small spark of hope that he might use it a couple of times a year.  He says it is lightweight, comfortable to hold, runs quietly, and he spent about 45 minutes using it without the cord in an attempt to bushwhack his extensive beard.  It did not run out of power before he ran out of beard, which speaks highly for the battery charge!  The razor comes with a charging plug, cleaning brush, and snap-on blade cover, and was easy to clean under running water.</li>
    <li> Summary: The PT 730 provides a decent shave and convenient features like the ability to rinse out the heads with running water. It looks nice and handles well. However, it&#x27;s results don&#x27;t feel any better to me than the lower priced Norelco 7310XL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Nicely styled with classic Norelco triple rotary heads.&lt;br /&gt;* The highly polished shaving heads are very smooth and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;* It is easy to clean with a pushbutton opening for the shaving heads that allows them to be cleaned out with a puff of air or a stream of water.&lt;br /&gt;* Very good battery life (over two weeks for me, but then again, I am an Asian ...).&lt;br /&gt;* Comes with charger, cleaning brush, and AC charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s a little longer than my old 7310XL, and the only reason seems to be that the tail end of this one is more pointed to make it look more sleek.&lt;br /&gt;* The patter on the shaving heads is such that although it is slightly smoother than my previous Norelco, it also takes longer to shave. Specifically, the shaving heads are a combination of tiny holes and slots whereas the older shavers have just slots. The result is slightly more comfort but definitely more time to get the job done. I&#x27;d personally rather be done faster since the old shaver was not UNcomfortable. This one is just slightly more silky feeling.&lt;br /&gt;* It costs more than the still available 7310XL. About 1.6 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;If someone gives you one of these, great! Nice shaver. If you are going to go out and buy one, I would get the 7310XL and save the money. I gave it four stars because I do like the shave, and I feel that there would be many who would value the slight edge in comfort over the 25% faster shave of the 7310XL.</li>
    <li> I have been using the 7310 Norelco for the past year, but this one seems to glide more easily/smoothly, probably due to the new HQ8 heads.  Combine that with the ease of being able to rinse it after use and 140 minutes of shaving on a charge and it is a winner.</li>
    <li> like it very much just need to get use to it</li>
    <li> I gave this to my son to review, he&#x27;s just recently started shaving and thought this was an excellent improvement over his throw away razors!  His comment was, \\&quot;wow, I love it!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor takes a great charge which lasts quite a while, it is comfortable to use...the grip feels great and it gives a good cut, and receives extra points for having a long enough cord so you can still shave while it is being charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is well made and seems like it was built to last.</li>
    <li> Takes more time than most electric razors, but seems to do a pretty good job.  Reasonably close shave and decent battery life.</li>
    <li> First few times you use it your hair will feel like it&#x27;s being pulled, but afterwards it works great.  Definitely don&#x27;t use if your hair is anymore than a 1/4 of an inch long.</li>
    <li> Very handy. Nice look and easy to use. The battery is good and it&#x27;s good for a person travels a lot like me.</li>
    <li> Always been a Norelco triplehead fan. But this is the closest, and comfortable, shaver I&#x27;ve had in quarter century! Great.</li>
    <li> I have used the Norelco razor for over 55 years and always thought they gave the best shave.  My children gave me two model 6940&#x27;s that I have been using for a couple of years and needed to be replaced so I dedided to try the PT730.  I find that it is much quieter than the previous model and gives the best shave I have ever had with any of the Norelco&#x27;s that I have owned.  I really like the ease of cleaning with running water and it holds the charge for at least a week...I charge it every Saturday so it probably would last longer than a week.  Works well for me and I recommend it to anyone.  My wife says it cuts closer than the multiple blade soap and water razor.</li>
    <li> Disappointing experience. Did not shave very close at all. Left uneven stubble.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for about a month and am not impressed. In order to get the closest shave they promise from this razor you must allow \\&quot;3 weeks for your hair and skin to adjust.\\&quot; Meanwhile, you have to go to work looking like a half-shaven bum (because if you shave with anything else, according to Philips, your facial hair won&#x27;t adjust properly). After the mandatory three week wolf-person phase, I am still not getting a close shave and have to go over the same spot relentlessly to catch every hair. All in all, I am extremely disappointed that I wasted so much money, time and irritated skin on this. I think I&#x27;ll just give up on shaving, move to Portland and grow a beard.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t be too critical of this shaver, because I haven&#x27;t used anything better.  That said, I haven&#x27;t used much, and I&#x27;ve stuck mostly to blades over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not just a face-shaver but also a head-shaver, so I&#x27;ve really put this unit through the paces doing both.  It does the job, I&#x27;m happy to say, and it does it better than my previous Norelco model (was sort of their lower-level model last year).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think any shaver is going to get as close as a blade.  For me, it gets my face about to the point that shaving WITH the grain, with a blade, would do.  That&#x27;s good enough, as I don&#x27;t have heavy facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does well enough on my head, too, although it takes a long time.  I usually spend 15 minutes shaving my head and face daily.  It doesn&#x27;t get my head hair anywhere near as close to the skin as a blade would, obviously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this for the convenience.  It seems to be easier, and probably cheaper, than using blades on my head, and it&#x27;s definitely easier on my face than blades.  It irritates my skin less both places.  The trimmer is handy and nice, too.  However, it doesn&#x27;t get as close to the skin as a blade.  I had sort of hoped it would.</li>
    <li> This is actually my first electric razor and I LOVE it. Used it every day for 2 years now with no problems and also still no need to replace blades. Charger works in Asia and EU as well. The shave is probably not the cleanest compared to high-end models but for its price it is amazing. Very satisfied and will look to buy another Norelco for my next one.</li>
    <li> touch and go, touch and stop, easy to clean, easy to hold, great value</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for a long time now, and while some minor design elements like buttons and graphics have varied over time, it&#x27;s the same old workhorse shaver. This one is pretty quiet, produces OK shave, and very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No real complaints but no real obvious improvements either. Basic shaver that lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> For facial hair, it cuts really close, but sometimes have to shave over once with a disposable razor blade to rid of the very few strands of shortened hair that remain, in order to keep my face extra smooth. If in a rush, and/or not in the mood to gel up my face and use the blade, I use the trimmer on the back of the shaver to cut most of the remaining hairs off. I use it to tidy up my beard while also keeping it low, to keep my mustache a certain length, and to shave my sides off, once a week. Each session takes about 3 - 5 minutes.    As for head hair, I have not used it to cut as close to the scalp as possible. I do use it to keep my hair low though (usually between 5mm to 10mm). One minor problem I have with shaving my head with this shaver is since my hair is very curly, after one pass around my whole head I have to clean out the shaver, or else the cut hair will curl around the blades, causing them to spin slower and cut inefficiently. Sometimes my hair gets stuck between a few grooves, which slightly extends the time to clean. To reduce the time spent stopping to clean the shaver out, I try not to go more than 2 days without shaving my head. Each session takes about 10 - 15 minutes, not including the time it takes to clean out the item (which would double the time).    When kept clean, the Philips Norelco PT730/41 Shaver 3500 cuts hair very well. If completely dead, it takes about 8 hours to fully charge, as indicated on the box. I usually charge it while I sleep after I&#x27;ve used it for about four 5-10 minute sessions. I&#x27;ve had this product for about 2 and a half months now and it works the same as it did when I first used it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son. When he uses it, it shaves very close. Happy with the purchase, thank you reviewers!</li>
    <li> Just got this shaver and charged it.  Used it one time so far with a trimmer first because I usually shave once a week.  Thought it was just me having used it only once and having to go over my face multiple times to get a close shave.  But I have read a lot of reviews and saw that not very many people liked this razor. Did it come with dull blades? no because it did not pull the hairs,  it was not painful, it just did not shave very well.&lt;br /&gt;For a shaver that cost more than $50,  this was a very poor product.</li>
    <li> This replaced another Norelco shaver for my husband. It works just fine.</li>
    <li> I have not used an electric razor in years.  I shave my face and head with a blade, normally.  I needed an alternative shaving method to use while recovering from a hip replacement surgery. This Norelco worked fine by giving me something I could use not having to stand at a sink to shave.  It did not give me a great shave but I got a better shave than I paid for.</li>
    <li> I guess it is too much to expect an electric razor to do what a razor blade and baby oil will do, but it is a good shave, if not great, and it is convenient. I like it when I don&#x27;t have time to mess with water, etc.</li>
    <li> I had a Remington that I liked but broke only after 6 months of use. Even though I liked the Remington, cleaning the head was a bit of a problem. I got this Norelco as a replacement and I LOVE it! The shave is SO CLOSE! and cleaning it is a DREAM!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this type of shaveer for many yers but this is the best. It&#x27;s very quiet and does a great job. I wish it came with a carrying case like my old one did.</li>
    <li> This is a decent cheap razor. I got the lower model without the trimmer as well. This one is better. Without a trimmer I need a regular razor on hand to cut the stubborn hair. Other than that, the razors are the same. I got a good shave in a reasonable amount of time. The good: It gives a decent shave and it is easy to use and hold. The bad: It is not as comfortable shaving with this razor as opposed to better quality shavers. It takes eight hours to fully charge! To it&#x27;s credit, it didn&#x27;t miss many hairs. Overall, I got a good shave and that is what counts.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers for the last forty years and this is the best model so far. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I had given my two sons Norelco shavers similar to this one that had been reviewed well, but they both complained about them. I was happy when I had a chance to try one myself, but I have to echo their lack of enthusiasm. This product doesn&#x27;t seem particularly well designed. It&#x27;s not very ergonomic, at least in my hand. The big problem is that it seems to resist the purpose for which it was intended: delivering a smooth, close shave. I tried it on my legs and underarms, and the criticisms my sons had were repeated for me: it resolutely left behind longer hairs, requiring going over and over the area (ouch!) and it seemed to have trouble with thicker, coarser hair. Skin and hair are pretty much the same story, whether on the face or legs, and if my legs were any indication, a truly close shave could take much longer than most people have to spare in the morning. The first time I tried it, it was incredibly irritating on my upper leg area, but the instructions tell you to expect that. Subsequent shaves were not as unsightly, but they were basically fruitless. I&#x27;m back to using my Gillette Mach 3, unless I ever have a chance to try a Braun or other European brand. If you are a young boy just sprouting a beard, this may work for you. Otherwise, I would suggest looking elsewhere. I give it 3-1/2 stars because the heads do float nicely (if ineffectively) over contours, it is cordless, and it rinses clean.</li>
    <li> Bought for my 93yr old father. Gives a great shave!y father loves it!</li>
    <li> Softening the beard with warm water first is the key to any good shave. After lightly drying my face, I find the shave is a smooth process with no pulling. I do the circular patterns as recommended, but I also use the shaver like a razor on my lower neck. For extra smoothness, you can also glide the razor down the jaw line with the edge of two rotors which acts like a straight edge without the cuts. The shaver is light weight which is a change from previous shavers I have used. It cleans up well under water and dries fairly quickly. A shave takes about seven minutes. The built in trimmer is ok for most needs. I rinse after the shave with warm water and clean up any missed spots. It is a quality product and I would buy it for a gift.</li>
    <li> Compared with the Norelco that I have from about 10 yrs ago, this one just doesn&#x27;t have the &#x27;heft&#x27; and good feel about it.  It just feels cheap but, that said, could be the result of better battery technology.  It does have a sideburn trimmer, which isn&#x27;t evident by the photos.  It does get a mention in the description and I missed it on the first reading.  It shaves just fine and the razor head swaps into my old shaver (Apologies for not getting up to look for the model number of the old one.).  I got this one as a birthday gift or I wouldn&#x27;t have replaced the other one - just might have bought a new blade head!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of it&#x27;s review. I am surprised how this product received so many good reviews. It was only good for few days then change the blades or trash it. I used Panasonic earlier and the cartridge lasted for more than a year.</li>
    <li> This razor is good but different than my original 1970&#x27;s vintage Norelco shaver.  It is built much lighter with a lot more plastic than my original one, but it seems to get the job done and has a trimmer as well.</li>
    <li> THE RAZOR IS FINE ONLY UP UNTIL THE CHARGE IT COMES WITH IS ALL GONE.......THEN I TRIED TO CHARGE IT WITH THE ELECTRIC ADAPTER  IT COMES WITH, AND IT DOES NOT CHARGE IT!!! IT IS ONLY 8 IN VOLTAGE, AND THE RAZOR IS 15 IN VOLTAGE, SO, IT IS NOT GOOD ANYMORE, I THINK IT SHOULD COME WITH AN ELECTRIC CHARGER ACCORDING TO THE RAZOR VOLTAGE, IN FACT I WILL WRITE TO AMAZON AND TELL THEM ABOUT THE WRONG CHARGER WAS PUT IN WITH  THIS RAZOR......</li>
    <li> Very close shave.  Keeps all the hair in the shaver so cleanup is easy.  I can shave in the livingroom.  Gave me razor bumps at first but my skin got used to it.  I also use after shave balm after use.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend- he absolutely loves it. Uses nothing else to shave. His skin is smoother than when he used a regular razor and noticeably less razor burn, the hair is even softer.</li>
    <li> I was going to buy a razor in the 100-150 range, but then I decided to give this a try.  I&#x27;m so glad I did.  This razor gives me an extremely close soft shave.  I don&#x27;t have the thickest hair in the world, but it handles amazingly. And for the cost it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
    <li> My last Norelco model 5801 lasted 10 years and sounded like a lawn mower. This is so quiet and cuts so close I know that it will out last me by at least a few years . I know that anyone who buys one will love it.</li>
    <li> The razor did not work well or for very long and did not do a good job. I would not order another one.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 16 year old son. Well made, works well, is quiet. shaves well . Good price and I recommend it. Shaver operates on 1.5 volts instead of my older shaver which is 1.2 volts and runs slightly slower.Get this model which is new and is handsome looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have had good experience with Norelco over the years, they are very reliable and will last for a couple of years usually until the rechargable batteries finally give out then you can continue using it plugged in to a ac socket. Get this model instead of the cheaper model (PT 720)that does not the side trimmer. My first razor was a Remington many years ago but the power cord kept vibrating off the shaver. My other son has a Norelco, I have two Norelcos, now my youngest son has his own.</li>
    <li> This is the first rechargeable razor I have owned. I am impressed with how long the charge lasts, and how good a shave I receive. And I love how quiet it is.</li>
    <li> have used this razor for 6 months now&lt;br /&gt;working great&lt;br /&gt;keeps a charge for days unlike others i have had&lt;br /&gt;easy to clean</li>
    <li> Very quiet with aclose comfortable shave. Easy cleaning.&lt;br /&gt; My husband had an older model that just wore out&lt;br /&gt;This was a terrific replacement. This is a quality razor you can&#x27;t go wrong.with this purchace.</li>
    <li> This razor came in a plain white box, instead of the standard company packaging. Despite being a new model, it&#x27;s very much similar to other Norelco razors long since released. In my humble opinion, Philips Norelco 7310 (also a basic model, but a little older) is better.  Pros  -For the money, you get the standard quality all Norelco razors offer, and if there&#x27;s one thing that can be said about this product, it&#x27;s the quality.  -Features such as cordless shaving, quick charging, comfortable precision based shaving, and an attractive design.  Cons  -In comparison to older basic models, particularly the 7310 model, this razor tends to get a little too loud during the shaving.  -The on/off button, which lights up in green in the 7310 model, is pretty much colorless in this model, blending into the blackness of the overall design, and making things a little boring (and too basic).  Overall, though, it&#x27;s pretty much similar to other Norelco models. If, like me, you already purchased a Norelco razor in the past, you can get a little nitpicky with this model. If, on the other hand, this is your first Norelco razor, you are likely to be satisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my son.  So far so good,  I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints.  Whenever I see my son he is clean shaven!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve previously owned Norelco razors, you know what to expect from this version. The technology really hasn&#x27;t changed from the last time my husband had a Norelco razor some time in the late &#x27;90&#x27;s. It offers a good, close shave and has a handy pop-up trimmer. The quick-charge feature is a good one as well.</li>
    <li> Good, not perfect shave for the $$. I usually have to use a regular razor to finish. It does a good job getting my shave started, however. Hold a charge for about 2-3 shaves, then I have to plug it in again. Not a bad starter shaver.</li>
    <li> I like this alot. There is no pinching or ripping the hairs out hairs like Remington  does ( there cheaper model $30) However i owned a philips before and paid $80 from walmart and was GREAT but after 2 years it started to rip out my hairs (i didn&#x27;t know i had to replace the head every 12 months) .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Norelco PT730 Powertouch Electric Razor is a great shaver. I love my previous one :( I sadly broke it by taking it apart...why did i do that don&#x27;t ask. This has a close shave. Doesn&#x27;t rip hairs out or pinch me. The shave isn&#x27;t as close as i expected but i saw a review saying the same thing and he updated it saying it broke in and about 2 - 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The shave is very close now. I shaved 3 times so far. Had a 5&#x27;0 clock shadow, It was great. But I am waiting for the closer shave. Or forgot to mention no burn or rash has happened yet like my old one but i think that was due to the head not being replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bottom Line: I would definitely recommend this, however my dad tried to snatch it so i bought him a cheaper model for 30 - 40 bucks, Not sure witch model. And i feel like his is the same but cheaper $&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great shave.</li>
    <li> Offers a close shave, much closer than my older Norelco (model unknown) which stopped working altogether for an unknown reason, just wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  The shaving was painless, close/smooth and extremely quiet so I rate this as great, however the power cord and connecting the cord to the razor is very weak.  It is much lighter, and feels fragile compared to my older model.</li>
    <li> My husband said it is fine, however, his last one had come with its own case, and this one  did not. He would have liked to have a new case.</li>
    <li> Nice razor.  It doesn&#x27;t run very fast, but the shave is good.  I use a blade in the shower once a week or so, which may be helpful.  As someone else noted, if you try to shake the water off, the cutter head my fly off, causing me to call upon my Sailor vocabulary.  I do like that I can pop the top and put it under the tap to clean it.  The battery seems to last long enough, and the power cord isn&#x27;t a pain.  Pretty happy, so far.  If it doesn&#x27;t last five years, I&#x27;ll be grumpy.  You&#x27;ll know it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first electric was a Remington wall plug, and it lasted a decade or more.  As I started liking shaving in the car on the way to work or after the gym, I went through a few Norelco cordless over a 20 year period.  When the batteries went bad, I just pitched &#x27;em.  Usually I&#x27;d repl the cutters a couple of times before the batteries STB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last one didn&#x27;t last as long or shave as well as I wanted, so I got a Braun, which lasted maybe five years before the batteries went south.  I replaced the cutting head every 18 months as recommended, but it never gave a great shave.  So I&#x27;m back to Norelco.  Yo, I tore the Braun down to parade rest - some kind of weird batteries, dang it.  I&#x27;ll fiddle with it, but probably won&#x27;t use it again.  Wow, is it a fine piece of engineering!</li>
    <li> Good razor for the price. Cleaning rotary razors can be a pain since you have to disassemble small parts to do a proper job, but shaves well and can be used with or without cord.</li>
    <li> My husband uses it to shave every day and he likes the way it performs. He likes being able to sit in his recliner and use it since it is hard as we grow older to stand and do it.</li>
    <li> CLOSEST SHAVE EVER; STRAIGHT RAZOR CLOSE. I&#x27;VE USED NORELCO ELECTRIC SHAVERS SINCE 1971. THIS MODEL GIVES ME A SURPRSINGLY CLOSE SHAVE; CLOSEST AND SMOOTHEST OF ALL THE MODELS THRU THE YEARS. I WAS SHOPPING FOR REPLACEMENT BLADES FOR MY CURRENT MODEL AND DECIDED TO JUST BUY NEW. I COULD NOT BE MORE PLEASED.  STEVE</li>
    <li> This is the second shaver of this model I have bought/used.  It is slow and does not have much power.  Faster to shave with a blade by far.  I am now using a Remington F5790 ... much better!</li>
    <li> Charge lasts for a month or more and provides a good shave.  There is an indicator that lights up when you need to recharge and goes out when charge is complete.</li>
    <li> This was my first electric razor and I&#x27;m impressed with how smooth it is. I&#x27;ve not had any problems with razor burn so far after 2 months of shaving.</li>
    <li> Bought this in December 2013. Within a month it would no longer take a charge. I returned it and had the most pleasant return experience ever. No hassle. Soon I had a new shaver. But within a couple of months, again it would not take a charge. And this shaver only works when charged. Plug the cord in and it doesn&#x27;t work. (Now I know to buy only corded or corded/cordless shavers,) So I got my third unit, at no added cost. That lasted until late January 2015 and the same old &amp;#34;no charge&amp;#34; problem again. Well I&#x27;ve just thrown out this Norelco shaver and have ordered a Braun shaver that works when plugged in, even if the battery is dead. I don&#x27;t know if Norelco shavers have a design problem or if the manufacturing process is not well controlled, but this should not be happening..</li>
    <li> gave this to my fiance for christmas. he was very excited because he wanted one of these for a long time. The reason for my bad rating was because no matter how gentle he was, this would chop his skin up so bad and leave him red and itchy. I guess I should have spent more then $45 for a good decent one.</li>
    <li> This razor was purchased to replace my old razor. What a joke.  The blades were duller then my old razor. What is amazon doing about suppliers selling garbage?</li>
    <li> Meh... is all that comes to mind. Trimmer is positioned in such a way that it closes when you use it. You have to position your thumb on it to keep it from slamming shut. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> have owner norelco electric razors for 30+ years. excellent product, always reliable and smooth to my face. trimmer good and stays sharp</li>
    <li> Just because you may find a more expensive one, it does not mean is better. I bought this one for my teenage son. I am sure he&#x27;ll love it.&lt;br /&gt;Gen2Alex from Orlando</li>
    <li> A good razor but doesn&#x27;t cut as well as what I replaced, which was identical, but an older model</li>
    <li> 2 years ago I bought the 7310 which was supposed to take HQ8 replacement heads which I bought and opened. I bought this shaver as I have Hq8 heads on hand and the description says to replace the heads for the best shave with these hq8 heads but they do not fit. The posts do not match and are not suitable and will not work as a replacement for this model PT730. It has a great shave but it is another throwaway model as the heads cannot be replaced.</li>
    <li> This is my first electronic shaver and experience is not good. Maybe it is my beard but this doesn&#x27;t give me a close shave as mach3. Also it kind of pulls the hair from my beard and it pains while shaving :(. I used to first trim my beard and then shave using norelco. I have stopped using it now and have gone back to Mach3. Maybe after one or two years will try a electronic shaver again.</li>
    <li> not close shave on multi day growths</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t trim properly, need to spend lot of time but even though this doesn&#x27;t trim clear. I feel lot of skin irritation.</li>
    <li> For over 50 years I have used electric razors of all brands including other Norelcos.&lt;br /&gt;This is the closest, smoothest shaving one of all and that&#x27;s on an old man&#x27;s tough whiskers.</li>
    <li> The trimmer likes to fold up when trying to trim your neck... also it takes quite a bit more time to get all the facial hair compared to my previous shaver.</li>
    <li> Look no further for an economical razor. So much cheaper and smoother than those ultra expensive blades. Never go back.  Bought extra head for two years of carefree mobile shaving.</li>
    <li> This razor works great! My husband loves it. Do not get the extended warranty Amazon offers since on the box it says it has a 2 year warranty already.</li>
    <li> Maybe because its new head but man its portable and shaves perfect its like you shaved with razor even better and hair grows back lighter and takes a while to grow. the engineering in this is amazing get one!!!</li>
    <li> For the past 55 years I have used a Norelco Razor starting with an old 2 head plugin, When I wore out my last Rechargable Norelco I went looking for a replacement and after reading the reviews I selected the Norelco PT730. I wanted a razor that was rechrgable, cleaned by washing out, long battery life and indicated when the battery was low, the PT730 did all of this. Next I started comparing prices and bought my PT730 online at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the PT730 for about a month now and today for the first time I put it on charge, it didn&#x27; indicate low but I am leaving on vacation and didn&#x27;t want to charge it while I was gone. I have a heavy beard and the lift and cut feature does a great job. The razor is lighter and quieter than my previous Norelco. I would say that the PT730 meets and exceeds my expectations in every way.&lt;br /&gt;Boyd Maddox</li>
    <li> It is good ,but I feel the appearance is not excellent.I hope that the appearance could be improved and maybe smaller is better.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes the Philips Norelco razor that we ordered from Amazon.com. The price was good and it works just great.</li>
    <li> I have a beard that resists shaving, even with a blade. Whiskers want to lie down and avoid being cut. This razor gets them all, generally on the first pass. For me, that&#x27;s new. Better than my old Remington.</li>
    <li> For those who like having options, this is an excellent razor.  Nothing fancy, but gives you the option to use cordless, with a cord, and includes a trimmer.  Plus, replacement heads are available.  My husband has been using it for years and loves it!  Would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in many years and I just got this shaver at Christmas and have only used it twice so far but it is comfortable and works great.</li>
    <li> I got one of these for my son and soon afterward replaced my aging Norelco with the same model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is long-lasting (2 years and the battery and blades are still going strong) in spite of sitting in my glove compartment year round. In the winter the cold battery (from being in my car overnight in freezing temperature) needs charging more often, but continues to let me shave on my drive to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get a good shave, the sideburn attachment works well, and the unit is easy to clean under running water. Great deal for the money.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have bought other brands in past and this has the best shave design. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this razor yet (I&#x27;m using and older model), but I know I will like it when I do use it.</li>
    <li> HUSBAND USES IT ALL THE TIME AND LOVES IT, HE DIDN&#x27;T WANT IT AT FIRST NOW THAT HE IS USED TO ELECTRIC HE WOULD NEVER GO BACK</li>
    <li> I read the ratings, so we knew what we were getting.  It is very obvious that this razor does not have the power of our old razor and will not hold up to years of shaving like they used to.  Expensive for the value.</li>
    <li> First electric razor I have owned since the 80&#x27;s, Used to have a Phillips back then.  The PT730 does the job okay when I am in a hurry to get out the front door to the golf course.  I am kind of amazed that nothing much has changed in the electric razor department in all that time, don&#x27;t quite know what I expected, maybe a slightly smoother shave?</li>
    <li> Quite shaver that my son and husband liked.Both have rough facial hair .It seems to be working well for them.</li>
    <li> Works well, Just wish the flip up trimmer stayed up a bit better, overall very happy given the price.  Much better then the brauns of the same price range.</li>
    <li> It works well and is worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for about one month, and the battery still works well. And it is east to clean the Electric Razor .</li>
    <li> I purchased this on behalf of my father, so I can&#x27;t directly comment, but he is pleased with it. He felt in was comparable in quality and features to the previous models he has owned, and prefers Norelco shavers to the foil-head Braun type.&lt;br /&gt;He is very hard on electric shavers and replaces them about every 3-4 years. (He doesn&#x27;t think the cost of new blades is worth the price, as he would rather spend a bit a more and get a whole new shaver, as the rechargeable battery tends to wear down, too.)</li>
    <li> It is a lot better than the previous ones I had. I will stick with name brand from now on.</li>
    <li> My husband is very pleased with this product.  He&#x27;s been a Norelco fan for 30 years and sees no reason to change.</li>
    <li> Bought this after my previous one (Philips Norelco 6613X) died after 7 years.  I have had this for about 2 months and so far so good.  It is super quiet and does exactly what I&#x27;d expect it to do!</li>
    <li> I got this razor for my husband and he loves it. I saw in the description that it handles long hairs as well as short hairs, and sometimes my hubby will go a few too many days without shaving, so I thought this might be good for him. He said other razors usually pull and hurt when the hairs get too long, but this one felt a little better, so that&#x27;s a plus. It was also easy to clean. He liked it very much. It gives a nice smooth shave. He said he gives it a thumbs up, five stars.</li>
    <li> I got this Norelco for my husband since this brand is all he will use....he charged it up - tried it and really liked it.  He said it gave a close shave which is what he is used to with his other Norelco.  Then he put it in the bathroom cabinet as there is nothing wrong with the Norelco he is using so he said he would keep it as a backup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coincidentally, my ladies Remington quit working so I &#x27;borrowed&#x27; the new Norelco in the bathroom cabinet.  I know it is sold primarily as a man&#x27;s shaver, but I absolutely love it!  It is lightweight and fits nicely in the hand. I did not have any problems using it....other than the black/silver color, I really couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between my &#x27;ladies&#x27; shaver and the Norelco PT730 as far as gentleness and not pulling on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco PT730 gets a thumbs up in this household!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for 50 years and have been very satisfied with their excellent performance and close shaves. Every shaver lasts up to ten to fifteen years as I replace the rechargeable batteries once every five years and the cutters annually. I usually buy their medium cost units. I like the fact the last Norelco shaver inlcuding this one can be cleaned under tap water, which helps the shaver to last longer and easier maintenance too.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cordless razor that would flex with my face -- so I got a clean shave without patchiness.  This razor delivered the goods.  It&#x27;s three heads flex and curve with my jawline and face so that I get a clean, even shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds a charge for a long time and cleans up easily and quickly.  It&#x27;s also lightweight and well balanced.  A very nice every day tool!</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver to replace a model that I had received in 2005 which had stopped holding a charge.  This one is lighter weight, much quieter, and I like the ease of cleaning in water.  It is so quiet that it sound like my old one did when the charge was running low on it.  At first, I thought it was under powered, but the closeness of the shaves proves this is not the case.  It gives a nice close shave.  Overall, I think this is good value which would be even better if they provided a carrying case or pouch to go with the shaver.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;product provides a quick shave, and overall it&#x27;s a pretty good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the end of the week my neck is tender and i have to take the weekend to let it heal.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas.  It doesn&#x27;t charge, and now Amazon says it&#x27;s too late to return!  Disgusted.</li>
    <li> After learning to use the shaver I put away my blade razor. With my usage, I get about 14 shaves between charges of the battery.</li>
    <li> I have owned this Philips Norelco PT730 Powertouch Electric Razor for about a month and it gives a clean shave and comes with a handy built-in trimmer. It is not as noisy as my previous Norelco razor. Another nice feature is that it indicates when a recharge is needed by blinking.</li>
    <li> A great gift from my wife for my birthday.  Great choice.  Only thing missing is a stand for it but that is only a minor inconvience.</li>
    <li> This shaver is much better than Norelco&#x27;s less expensive models, well worth the extra money.  It has great features and I did get a much closer shave than the 7310.  The seller was quick getting the order to me and it was offered at a good price.</li>
    <li> I was impressed with the quietness, closeness and ergonomics of this product.  It was soooooo quiet I thought it was not ON! One full charge of the battery lasted for more than 3 weeks. Cleaning it was a bit tricky. Make sure you read and follow the manual.</li>
    <li> Works well. My husband likes it. it seems to do the job.</li>
    <li> Seems to cut fine.  Not as close as shave cream and hand razor but it is quick and effective.</li>
    <li> nice gift for my farther</li>
    <li> The motor speed is not as powerful as my last Norelco razor. Otherwise it is fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2-3 months. Works well, keeps a long charge, and is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Works great ,very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Philips PT730 Razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cordless razor was tested on whiskers that were used to an old fashioned blade shaver. All test shaving has been done on dry skin. No gel or hot water was applied to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor works very well, resulting in a nice smooth shave with no risk of cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no burn after shaving. The razor does much better than a manual razor when it comes to navigating scars and cuts. Shave right over the scar with no damage done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little longer to shave since it is not as easy to see via the shaving cream where you have shaved and where you have not shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> The Norelco PT730 shaves very closely. In comparison with a 10-year old Norelco model (fitted with brand new blades), it leaves the face much smoother. This is probably due to the modifications that have been made to the circular screens that contact the skin. The ability to rinse the shaver under running water is a great convenience.  Here are a couple of tips for maintenance:  *As recommended in the product manual, do rinse the blade assembly and parts where the hair collects after each use. After rinsing and gently shaking to remove dripping water, leave the head assembly open to air dry. Be careful when shaking the unit, as the head assembly is held by a friction spring, and can easily be shaken apart from the razor body.  *While it is possible to disassemble the head assembly for brush cleaning, the reassembly is not as straightforward as was the case with earlier models, so you want to avoid having to do this until necessary.  These razors have come down in price over the years, have a better battery (lithium-ion vs. nickel-cadmium), and do a better job. If you have an older Norelco razor, you might consider replacing it with the PT730.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shaver. Why? The HQ8 shaving heads, I like rinsing the shaver, and it&#x27;s very quiet.  The HQ8 shaving heads are much more comfortable than the Speed XL HQ9 heads and do a better job.  I switched to electric shaving years ago.  Was hooked after the first shave. I haven&#x27;t cut myself shaving in 20 years. I started with a standard Panasonic, then the Panasonic Linear, Norelco Speed XL(until it died about 15 years), Braun, and now back to Norelco with the 3500.  The Braun is to loud. Very loud! I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore.  Used it a year and a half. The Norelco does a better job cutting longer hair when I don&#x27;t shave a couple of days and does a better job on the neck.  Compared to the Braun it seems the motor is wimpy. Don&#x27;t be fooled.  This shaver cuts well.  My beard is like barbed wire.  Also, I want to mention something I feel is important about skin irritation.  I&#x27;ve very sensitive skin and I noticed the lifters on the shaving head are brass and were causing me irritation. I took the liberty of removing them. They are not needed. Very easy to remove. I&#x27;m making no sacrifices removing them. The shave is just as close. Just use a pair of needle nose pliers and a jewelers visor so you can see what your doing.  I did this when I used the Speed XL.  I love the Norelco shaver without the lifters. It&#x27;s really not difficult to remove them.  Also, this shaver does not come with a travel pouch nor a charging stand.  I contacted Norelco through a chat window on the support site and they are sending me a pouch and charging stand free of charge!  Stellar customer service!  If you are switching to an electric shaver for the first time you may have some irritation because your skin is raw from blade shaving. Give it time and you will never go back.</li>
    <li> shaver came in good time and in new out of the box shape. shaves clean and smooth. everything works. easy to clean. so far so good. i&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I used Norelco shavers long ago. I can&#x27;t remember exactly why I stopped, but it probably had something to do with the my belief that it is impossible to get a blade-close shave with an electric. Then, one day in December I realized that I am the only one who knows the difference. Who cares if the blade shave is closer? And, if I had a nickle for every time I got up too late to use the foamy crap and then clean up to go over the missed spots again (skipped shaving altogether on those days).... Well, I got to looking at my old Norelco, (battery shot) and said, &amp;#34;what the heck, let&#x27;s give a new one a try&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m glad I did. The first couple of shaves were not anything to write home about, but after the 3rd &amp; 4th, they just got better. Now, I&#x27;m just as fast, probably faster than with the shaving cream and blade, I can quickly see if I need to hit a spot again, I never nick myself (OMG! What a time saver that is!) and, I don&#x27;t know the difference in closeness til some time in the afternoon. Then, yes, there is a bit more stubble than before. Nobody notices. This morning I got up late, heck, brought it along and shaved at work! Battery life great, super quiet, cleans up well under the faucet! Wow! Give this shaver a try, you won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> i alreday bought 2 for my parent it&#x27;s good things whith a good shiping time  i very like it !</li>
    <li> In these modern times, where chaos and political upheaval are all around us, it&#x27;s nice to know you can still find little islands of stability and sanity in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is one of those islands. It&#x27;s very simple, really; you push a button and it whirrs. You rub the front bit on your face and it makes hair go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not brilliant about it. Sometimes, you have to rub the round bits on the same spot on your face more than once to make all the hair disappear. If you&#x27;re looking for the high-tech, GPS-guided cruise missile of hair removal, this isn&#x27;t it. But it is cheap, and it works, and it makes a satisfactory mechanical noise while the spinny bits whisk away unwanted hair. Really, what more do you want in a razor?</li>
    <li> Coming from a similar Philips Norelco razor that was a few years old, my husband was surprised at how much better this razor is. Among the improvements:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The battery lasts much longer and charges incredibly fast&lt;br /&gt;- The indicator light for low-battery, charging, fully charged, etc. actually makes sense&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given this model&#x27;s very reasonable price point, it would likely be a nice upgrade for anyone who has an older model and is ready to replace it.</li>
    <li> The PT730 gave me an excellent shave right away, and I did not find that I needed any familiarization or break-in period. I have quite light hair and dry skin, so this may be a factor. The initial charge took a long time as I expected, but weekly re-charges take no more than four hours. The pop-up trimmer is a useful addition for mustache and sideburns.</li>
    <li> Works alright but wish I would have gotten a model or two up from this.  It is fairly noisy and while it does shave pretty well, it feel flimsy.</li>
    <li> Out of the box this razor felt much better than my previous $25 Remington.  It had a good 5 year run but was beginning to keep short battery life so it was time for a replacement.  The first thing I noticed about the PT730 was the appearance.  The buttons are cleaner, tolerances on parts are tighter and it seems to be an all around better product.  Right out of the box I was able to fire it up and shave without having to wait for a charge.  My initial thoughts were \\&quot;OUCH!\\&quot;  My Remington was known to pull if the hair was long enough so I didn&#x27;t take any chances with this one.  I used the Pop-up Trimmer to knock them down to a reasonable level before using the razor.  I also noticed much more of a \\&quot;razor\\&quot; feel, as thought i was shaving instead of getting a haircut (as I did with my Remington).  It was a bit of a trick to figure out which direction to push/pull with this razor to get some of the longer hairs to cut.  I would say this was the only downfall of the PT730 and may be the case with all Norelcos (assumption)  After a few minutes, I now have the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric razor.  My wife even said she doesn&#x27;t remember ever seeing me \\&quot;this clean shaven\\&quot;.  I purchased an over-priced fancy $150 Norelco in the past and didn&#x27;t feel it cut any better than the $25 Remington so I returned it.  The PT730 is definitely a cut above (or should i say shave above) the Remington.  Hopefully this one will last many years and continue its perfect cut.</li>
    <li> While definitely not as good of a shave as using a razor this definitely works way better than some of the electric razors I have used. Easy to clean, easy to use. Great product.</li>
    <li> Works better than any electric razor I have purchased. I did buy the top of the line Norelco for $175.00 and this product works better!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a present for a family member and they say it works well and they like it a lot.</li>
    <li> This item has saved my life in the numerous battles of the Great Beard war of 2013. There were times when I thought I wouldnt have made it, but at the end my Philips Norelco came through and cut down the beard brigade that stood in my path of getladiesstan. The women had loved what my trusty Norelco PT730 has done for me and the only way I can repay the favor is by letting people know it works and getladiesstan proves it. I know what your thinking, &amp;#34;this guy must be 12&amp;#34;. Well at heart I am, but no. I am just an ordinary guy, who woke up mad bored and hate getting amazon review emails at the butt dock of 3am (seriously amazon why you think im up) and decided to write a stupid review before going back to sleep.  Oh, but the product was alright, although I found better quality ones for a cheaper price at bestbuy &amp; walmart.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Comfortable to hold, compact and easy to clean.  Have had others and like the item. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> very godd!however if there is a Chinese Instructions wil be better.suggestion and advices if you read it ,please answer to me</li>
    <li> Price was very good, razor is not good as my old Norelco razor that lasted me forever.  Shaving with the old one took about 10 min.  This one takes 15-20, because you have to keep going over spots.  If you are frugal like me you will buy this because of the price and the name, but buyer beware, you get what you paid for a less than mediocre razor</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for ... at least 4 decades.  My latest shaver gave up the ghost after a decade.  I ordered the PT730 as a compromise between frills (battery indicator) and features (pop up trimmer). The special pricing by Amazon was a strong inducement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression is that the shaver is built very cheaply for the price.  It is lighter, possibly owing to the switch from heavier Ni-Cd batteries.  The cut is less efficient than had from prior Norelco shavers, possibly because the motor seems to spin at a slower speed. I suppose the razor is OK, but its definitely not the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDENDUM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that I have to use a regular blade every week or so to \\&quot;catch up\\&quot; with overgrowth.  After a year or so, I&#x27;d have to conclude that I&#x27;m not impressed with this razor.</li>
    <li> I have a SensoTouch 1290X which is a Wonderful Shaving Machine and I bought a Jet Clean for it off of Ebay, as in the USA they do not sell a 1290CC like they do in Europe for $700. Well, I wanted a second razor for my camp and I bought a Top of The Line PowerTouchAT920 sold only at Target for $130. Within a month, it was dead, so I took it back to Target and got another one. The replacement lasted about a month and I took it back to Target and got my money back. I still wanted a PowerTouch, so I went to Walmart and got a PowerTouch730. This razor is a disappointment in everyway, however, it does look cool right out of the box with it&#x27;s sleek design and black color.  Well then: What&#x27;s wrong with it? First of all: It does not have smart pivot like the upper models. Second, it does not have 3 shaving rings like the upper models only one. It takes 8 hrs. to charge this razor. It only has 40 min of shaving time. Finally, It does not come with a pouch to store it in and also, the motor has very little power and sounds like a dead horse! Don&#x27;t waste your money on this junk!!! If you need a good razor invest in something cool like the SensoTouch 1280CC or the 1290X and you&#x27;ll be glad that you did!!!!</li>
    <li> I have wanted to buy the Norelco for a long time. I just sick and tired of using the cheap razors. I was always nicking myself. Well that is over thanks to Norelco. I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I got this for my dad who only has use of his right arm/hand, specifically because it only takes one hand to clean it.  There is a little release button that is easy to push and the head flips open, then you can rinse the shaving heads under running water to clean. Simple!!  It does come with a cleaning brush, so I will do a more thorough cleaning for him if needed when I visit.  He will still need an aide to plug the charger into the razor, but that&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. The only downside is the cleaning, which can be a little tricky. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Shim.&lt;br /&gt;I think that it was perfect shaver for me!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really really loving it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was good choice to buy this product!</li>
    <li> Wish I&#x27;d have gotten it sooner. It cuts very close and is easy to clean. My neck burned a little the first few days, but it is OK now.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it.  it doesn&amp;#34;t shave as closely as my five year old norelco razor.  I was disappointed with the quality of the shave and the thickness of the body of the shaver.</li>
    <li> I  have used a Norelco for several years, but this one gives the closest shave yet. I wish it had a stand. but I wanted to spend less, so I have to lay it down.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to get a close shave. Have to go over the same spot multiple times before getting a clean shave. Bought this to save time versus using the conventional razor and shaving gel, but that has not been the case to this point.</li>
    <li> I am just getting out of the Army and as such I wanted to change from a blade to an electric razor because of skin irritation.  I knew that I wouldn&#x27;t be getting as close of a shave as I normally would get with a blade, using an electric razor, but I wasn&#x27;t really too concerned with it as I thought it would be close enough.  Well I was wrong about that, or should I say I was wrong in thinking that this shaver would get the job done.  While it does a decent job at getting the really thin short hairs on my upper cheeks, anything from under my nose to my chin and neck look like I didn&#x27;t even bother to shave at all!  And this is after at least 5 to 7 minutes of using the electric razor over and over on my face and neck!  So unless you hardly get any facial hair at all, (as in you only need to shave once or twice a week and still look clean shaven all week), then I&#x27;d highly recommend staying away from this product!</li>
    <li> I HADN&#x27;T used a electric razor for years , so I was concerned that it might not work all that well.  It was much better than I could have expected.</li>
    <li> Works great, rarely have to shave like it is, cuts close and smooth with no razor burn, long battery life.</li>
    <li> I really like this unit. It is very quiet and my son who I use it on doesn&#x27;t seem to mind it. I was looking for a razor that would have&lt;br /&gt;the side burn attachment and this one does, why it is so noisy as compared to the whole unit is beyond me. It gives a close shave so&lt;br /&gt;overall it was worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> All I can say is it is better than I expected. If your thinking of buying one, do it.  Holds a charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> I own this razor for 10 months now. Still works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice battery life. Gives a nice shave. No irritation.</li>
    <li> The Norelco PT730 does not give a particulary close shave. Not unusual for an electric razor. However, the real problem is cleaning. When the head is opened the rotary shaving heads become loose as does the retainer. Reassembly is quite delicate and difficult and easily done incorrectly. One doesn&#x27;t need this complication in order to shave. A twin blade razor costing less tnan ten dollars does a better job and has no moving parts.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my existing shaver.  My existing shaver works well but the charge does not last long.  I wish this company would design their product so that users could swap out the batteries.  The new shaver works well but the batteries are still not user replaceable.</li>
    <li> Good products. Doesn&#x27;t hurt the skin, shaves long hair without trimming it first, good trimmer. Easily washable. But... It needs a little to many strokes to shave and doesn&#x27;t shave close...</li>
    <li> My Phillips Norelco  razor is a slice of heaven.  Glides over skin with ease.  It could shave a little closer, but that just means I have to shave every day.  The best thing ab0out it is the cleaning.  Take the head off and hold both the razor and the head under waem water until they are clean</li>
    <li> I needed a repacement, because the old shaver stopped working.  It has a high rating, and the price with shipping was $20.00 lower than the store in town had it.  The cordless feature will be vey handy.  It arrived earier than estimated.</li>
    <li> This model the charge adapter does not fit the razor perfectly. When plugged, it can fall out easily. That is a design flaw.</li>
    <li> Excellent electric razor, but I prefer a blade in general. Blades however ere not allowed in the hospital where I was on blood thinner.</li>
    <li> This is the third Norelco Electric Razor that I&#x27;ve owned. Quieter than the last model, shaves just as well, even after a two day beard.</li>
    <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t rant and rave about getting a close shave but neither does he complain.  Easy cleaning features are appreciated.</li>
    <li> This was a gift, so I cannot rate it since it was a Christmas present given to an individual in another state.</li>
    <li> The product cost performance is good, easy to use and good use effect. I would like to recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> 14 yr. olds first Razor!!!!!  he was thrilled............works beautifully..........don&#x27;t have to worry about him cutting himself and he thinks he is a &amp;#34;Big Guy&amp;#34; now</li>
    <li> I like it very much. It holds a charge all week. It is easy to clean. The price is not bad eather.</li>
    <li> It does not give as good of a shave as the older model Philip Norelco razor I have..unfortunately, that one, which I have had for many years just wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge very long any more, so I decided to try this one. Liked the old one better.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the PT730.  I have owned a Norelco 5842 XL for 26 years.  It has dropped down to about 1 week of use per charge from the 6 weeks it was for many years.  I am only on my second set of shaving heads.  I just got tired of charging it weekly.  The old razor outperforms the PT730 in every way.  The only advantage the new one has is that it is lighter and quieter and that is mostly due to it having a marginal motor.  It has no more than half the power of the old razor.  I was also surprised to find that it doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as my 15 year old cutting heads.  Maybe things have to wear in a bit for optimum closeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately for me, the PT730 does an adequate job because I don&#x27;t have very heavy whiskers.  For those who have light to medium whiskers, this shaver will be fine.  If you have manly-man stubble I would suggest looking for something with more power.  If you require a very close shave, look elsewhere as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - I have had the razor for a month now and I feel obligated to up my rating from 3 stars to 5 stars.  The heads or my face broke in after 3 or 4 days and I am now getting a very nice shave.  It went 4 weeks on the first charge being used 5 days a week.  I went 3 days without shaving once and when I did resume, there was no pulling or tugging at all.  Very nice.  I still find the motor to be weak, but it seems to do the job for me, and I really like the light weight and low noise.  I would still be hesitant if you grow really heavy whiskers, but to all others I say buy this one.</li>
    <li> I recently started using an electric razor again after not using one for several years. It did take a couple weeks to adjust to this shaver, which was uncomfortable at first but the owners manual said to expect that for the first couple weeks or so. After about a month of using it, I am very happy with the PT730. It is lightweight, can be cleaned under the sink, and works well. I have moderately thick hair and this razor has no problem dealing with it. Obviously there are more expensive razors out there and you get what you pay for, but this one is a good compromise between the entry level model and the upscale $100+ models. I&#x27;m happy with this and will continue to use it until it stops working.</li>
    <li> Great,  It&#x27;s lighter, quieter, and gives a better shave than my last Norelco.  It also has a trimmer built in</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the small things with this one. A cover to protect the blades actually helps when it sits in the bathroom, a location with water flying everywhere, it&#x27;s nice to make sure the blades stay nice and protected. It&#x27;s very easy to clean, disassemble, and reassemble again afterward. For just a little bit of stubble, I haven&#x27;t had any problem with it at all, and if that&#x27;s what you need it for, at this price, I would say it&#x27;s a sure buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, it doesn&#x27;t deal with thick hair very well. The blades are fine, but it will pull and tug, and generally not create the best experience. Unless you press fairly hard, it can also miss the occasional smaller hairs. No big deal, but certainly annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also note that being able to use it without it being plugged in is fantastic. I lived in a dorm room for a while, and there were no outlets inside. Guess what this ended up replacing? Overall a solid razor, and one of the best electric razors for the price out there if I had to pass a guess.</li>
    <li> Have had this item now for over a month. Have only recharged it twice, in spite of daily shaving.&lt;br /&gt;VERY quiet.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Best razor I&#x27;ve owned, regardless of price.</li>
    <li> This is the third time we have purchased this product. Each time we are more pleased than the last. The shave is close and smooth and the battery lasts a long time without recharging. It&#x27;s perfect for long weekends, etc when there is no need to worry about recharging.</li>
    <li> With mixed feelings and desperation I purchased this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read several reviews, and although it seemed that it was a good buy, many of the reviews I found cautioned that it wasn&#x27;t the best for heavier facial hair. Since the price was right, I made the purchase. True to the other reviews, I found that it does lack a little in the cutting department, but does not fail completely. Allow me to elaborate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One - two days worth of full stubble is not that big of a deal. I shave almost every morning, and found that this razor did a pretty good job taking care of about 97% of the hair. I did have to go in with a disposable to hit around the sideburns, but I expected to do so from the get-go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two &amp; 1/2 - Four days worth of stubble is pretty spotty. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, there&#x27;s no grinding of the tiny motors, or smoke coming from the device when using it under these conditions... but I did notice that it missed a hair here, and a hair there. Actually, missing a few noticeable ones all over the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in the long run, If you&#x27;re shaving with it every day, then, YES, this is a great razor. I have not noticed any irritation or problems from using it, it gets under and around the nose area very well, and it holds a pretty good charge. But if you&#x27;re looking to use it once a week between a lot of growth, you may wish to look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that the purpose of buying a rotary razor is for shaving my head.  I am a bald male who prefers not to use a razor blade across my head and instead enjoys the comfort of using an electric razor as an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco has always been my choice of rotary razor, and for years I have been using various models.  The most recent model was their Speed-XL series (with HQ9 replacement heads) which are expensive but well made.  After owning this particular model for the past 3 years, I decided it was time to replace the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found out that buying a new Norelco razor is not an easy chore.  If you are reading this review, you probably have been knocked silly by the sheer amount of different Norelco razors that the company sells through Amazon.  One has no clue (outside of the reviews) which is the newer models or which one is superior to the other.  As of this review, I think the PowerTouch razors are the new line of offerings this year.  They include the PT720, PT730, AT810 and AT830.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first choices were the AT810 and AT830.  Thought it would be great to have a Norelco that I could use wet in the shower.  However, I stopped dead in my tracks when I realized that those two razors could only be operated on battery power.  Mind you, I had no intention of plugging in the razor and walking into the shower with it -- and I am certain Norelco disabled the ability to do this just on safety ethics.  However, from experience I have learned that the batteries in these razors become less and less efficient over the years of ownership and I would much rather use it corded at home and save the battery for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PT730 became the obvious next best choice for me though I was concerned by some of the reviews that cited it as being cheaply built.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used this razor for the past two days, I can tell you a few things about it....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, if you are coming from an older, more expensive Norelco you will immediately notice that the PT730 does indeed feel cheap.  It&#x27;s a basic no-frills razor with none of the bells-and-whistles of the more expensive choices.  But you know what?  I wasn&#x27;t in the mood to spend more than $50 for a rotary razor and I got exactly what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The huge surprise came when I began shaving my head.  The Norelco managed to provide an exceptional close shave with little effort.  Unlike my older Norelco, I did not have to make multiple passes over the same area to get a smooth, clean shave.  Suffice to say, I am very happy with this purchase and I think you will be too.elco you will immediately notice that the PT730 does indeed feel cheap.

    <li> This razor was used by my 18 year old brother in law; it was his first electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took him 2-3 weeks to get used to the razor, and he was able to get a close shave with it right away. It&#x27;s quite, easy to use and easy to clean. The battery is very long lasting; he was able to get about 2 weeks of use from it before having to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue he had with it was that it was not terribly comfortable to hold at first, but that issue somewhat resolved itself as he got used to using it.</li>
    <li> AFTER CHARGING THE FIRST TIME, THE MOTOR SEEMED SLOW. BUT AFTER ADDITIONAL CHARGES IT DOESNT IMPROVE.IT DOESNT CUT VERY CLOSE.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase for elderly parent. He is very satisfied. Received  soon after order was placed.</li>
    <li> Razor was used maybe 7 times over the course of a year. (beard grower here)...  On the last day it worked I had used my clippers (Wahl) to trim the 2&amp;#34; beard down to stubble.  While using the Norelco to take the stubble down to a smooth face one of the blades came apart, totally failing and preventing the razor from rotating.  Good thing I had a SquareTrade extended warranty... oh wait, they denied the claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah I won&#x27;t buy another, or get another SquareTrade warranty.</li>
    <li> This razor is better than my old one, it is light weight, and easy to use, with LED to demonstrate the battery condition.</li>
    <li> excellent razor and the price couldn&#x27;t be beat.  easy to use and any parts are readily available if they are needed at a later date.</li>
    <li> I wanted to get my father a new electric razor and did not want something that had 310 unnecessary features. He&#x27;s old school and wants something plug and play and durable and that&#x27;s exactly how I&#x27;d describe this razor. I&#x27;ve had a Norelco razor since 2004 and it still works great so no reason for me to expect anything less from this one. Easy to operate, clean and maintain.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always prefered a close shave and this shaver doesn&#x27;t come close. Shaving several times over the same area and still feeling a roughness isn&#x27;t for me. I may use it for moments to do a quick job, then again I might except the loss and cost. Its also a pain to clean up.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son when he first started shaving. It works great for that quick shave before school.</li>
    <li> This is my third Norelco razor. Although, it has a lot of functionality for the price, I don&#x27;t think it shaves as well as my previous razors.  The razor is quieter which might mean its running slower, but I can&#x27;t be sure. I just don&#x27;t seem to be able to get a close shave and I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard. I like the Norelco razors, I would just suggest trying another Norelco model.</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve been using more that one razor to get a proper shave. As you grow older, your beard tends to lie flat in areas and they are hard to get at with most razors. So I have been using a rotary and foil to get the whole job done. This one unit does it quickly and with a single unit WITH a trimmer. I think the combination of Phillips and Norelco has produced a better product that Norelco produced individually. Rock on... Hope this continues...</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for his birthday and he likes it. Arrived on time and they packaging was secure.</li>
    <li> Very Good Product for the Money. I would recommend this Philips Norelco PT 730 Powertouch Electric Razor as very good buy.</li>
    <li> This razor seems more for a teenager beginning to shave than an adult, it lacks power. The shave is reasonably close. The only wonderful thing about this razor is you can use it with the power cord.</li>
    <li> Well, my old norelco plug in model finally gave out.  I&#x27;ve used it for years, probably 20 or so.  This new one really does a great job.  It is much more quiet than the old one.  I recharged it after 2 weeks even though it still had more umph left in it.  Totally happy with it.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco PT730 Powertouch Shaver is fast, easy to use, easy to clean ad holds charge for many hours.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my father in law as a gift. It came in and fast and is nicely working.</li>
    <li> Shaver is very quiet and gives a good clean shave.  No messing with shaving cream and bladed which are getting very expensive.  I like being able to do a quick touch up before an activity.</li>
    <li> This model works well but falls short of the model it replaced. It is suppose to be water tight however it leaks water inside the body when washed make it necessary to clean with a brush instead of washing under the faucet.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver, it gives me a close cut, saves me time and was well worth the discounted price. I had no problems with packaging that others posted about. I would definitely recommend buying this.</li>
    <li> an inexpensive shaver that suits my needs.  I like the rotary head because every other flat head razor I&#x27;ve had drops shaving stubble out of the head.</li>
    <li> my husband rarely comments on anything either way. So for him to actually say it was a good razor would be like anybody else getting really excited over how wonderful the razor is. So I gave it a 5.</li>
    <li> Not a very good shaver, possibly because it&#x27;s the cheapest one? It doesn&#x27;t work on 3 days growth but it does work on one or two days worth. You have to go over the same spot over and over again, takes forever, quicker to just use a razor. Might work better on teenagers or girls.</li>
    <li> I cant say this is better than or worse than disposable blades. It takes a long time to shave, I have to go over and over my face ... the only upside is I can do it at work vs regular shaving. I do get a little raw afterward though and use some clean lotion to stop the burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Choice is convenience over quality.</li>
    <li> This is a great price for this Norelco model..  Saved about $15.  compared to box stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - Quick, easy to shave, no foam or hot water.  No more expensive blades.&lt;br /&gt;Cons - Not as close a shave as the old way.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S GREAT,  EASY ON THE FACE AND EASIER TO CLEAN!!!&lt;br /&gt;Really love it, worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is nice on sideburns.</li>
    <li> its a good shaver does the job without frills if you want something with bells and whistles this is not the shaver for you</li>
    <li> I have used razors by several manufacturers in the past, and this one provides just as close a shave as any that I have used before.  In addition, it is VERY quite and lasts for almost 2 weeks on a single charge.</li>
    <li> I cannot compare this razor with other models, but it does the job perfectly.  Disposable razors hurt your skin, while this razor shaves and massages at the same time. Charging time is very short compared to NiCd batteries.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not real happy with this product.  Shave not as easy or close as it was with my earlier version. I wonder whether the shaver could have been a returned item, repackaged.  But shaver will do--for now...</li>
    <li> I have used a 3 head for 15  years. I shave me face and my head every day. When my last shaver died my wife bought me a new one, but it&#x27;s a piece of junk. The HQ8 cutting heads are flimsy, so when you try to clean them the blades get disturbed and don&#x27;t rotate freely without a lot of noise. This morning I shaved with just 2 heads in because it was so noisy. And no Norleco does not get rewarded by me buying new cutters. These ones are only a few months old, the old Norelco went forever and I could clean the cutters every week. Plus the new one is difficult to get back together, and the small knob that locks the cutter holder in place is loose, so it dropped in the shower, but luckily I was able to catch it before it went down the drain.  The battery does last a long time, but who cares if I can&#x27;t shave with the thing after one cleaning!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m seeking something different now. Too bad they screwed it up! Don&#x27;t buy a Norelco until they bring up the quality.</li>
    <li> Shaving is smooth.  Razor is durable and feels good in your hand.  Bought it for my father in law.  He loves it.</li>
    <li> Razor was fine. I choose it after comparing similar products on the web. Besides giving a great shave, I especially like the variable voltage ability and the razor&#x27;s ability to keep a charge more than a week. Amazon had the best price, didn&#x27;t charge for shipping, and got it here with no cost in less than 2 days. Bottom line &#x3D; One mucho satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I had a Braun from Walmart ($40 range) originally that worked just fine for many years. It grew legs and walked away one day and I needed to replace it.  I couldn&#x27;t find a new Braun in that price range so I bought this one as it looks almost identical. Its NOT. Thee &amp;#34;heft &amp; quality &amp; job it does&amp;#34; are about  maybe 65% as good. I don&#x27;t think it will hold up as long as my Braun did. I would not buy this again and do not recommend it at all. It just acceptable for now, till it breaks.</li>
    <li> He likes it.  It works great and he can rinse it to clean it.  I love it because he can rinse it to clean it instead of getting all of the little hairs everwhere on the counter when he cleans it. :-)  Good for both of us!</li>
    <li> Works well. Cutting head is very large and not that flexible so it struggles in areas that have a lot of heavy curves. If you have a small face this might not be good for you!</li>
    <li> I got this electric razor for my fiancé as a birthday gift. He loves using it! I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> You have to run the razor over the area repeatedly to get coverage.  Plastic housing is pretty cheap and the head looks like it would break easily.  I had one of these for 15 years and loved it.  The quality has deteriorated significantly over the years.</li>
    <li> Does not give a smooth, close shave.  Blades are harsh on face.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for his birthday and he says it works just great and I also bought the replacement heads so he would have them when he needs to change the heads.</li>
    <li> This is garbage.  It just doesn&#x27;t work well.  It&#x27;s not good for my neck, and it is TERRIBLE for my head (which I usually shave with a razor).</li>
    <li> It has been a while since I receiver this razor.  Before when a shaver got older and didn&#x27;t do a good job I would throw it away. This time I got some new blades, or rotors, and I am using the replacement cutters instead of throwing away the shaver.</li>
    <li> My husband has always used Norelco shavers because they last for years. I bought this one to replace one that he&#x27;d had at least 10 years. He&#x27;s very happy with his new shaver.</li>
    <li> I had bought a travel shaver from another company and I used it for over a year, trying to get used to it and getting a razor burn every time.  I bought one of these and it was smooth shaving from the very first time.  So I bought a second one so I have one at home and one to travel with.</li>
    <li> The razors are extremely dull and the motor is extremely weak.  This means shaving is an extreme effort.  You will find yourself moving over and over the same single hair in every possible direction in an attempt to cut it.  Further, it consistently causes razor burn on my neck because I have to go over it so many times trying to successfully cut the hair.</li>
    <li> I am not a believer in electric shavers, but am really impressed with the quality of this shaver. Following neck surgery, I needed to give up my usual manual blade shaver for some time. I was recommended this shaver, and since using it, have really got attached to it.</li>
    <li> Electric razor works wells. It holds charge for a week. Cleaning is easy.&lt;br /&gt;Product is a buy at reasonable price.</li>
    <li> The plug does not fit the electrical sockets here in Australia. Had to buy an adapter to use it. It&#x27;s quiet and slow, but does the job. Gives a close shave.</li>
    <li> It is very difficult to clean with its brush. Maybe a longer brush would work. I hope the remnants of hair at the base of the &amp;#34; rotating spindles&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t cause a reduced  life usage of the product. Washing doesn&#x27;t remove them.</li>
    <li> This machine is so quiet!! And it shaves well and fast, especially if you make sure that your skin is tightened by stretching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sjoerd</li>
    <li> I was faced with either buying replacement blades for my old Philips Norelco razor or buying a new razor.  I&#x27;m glad I chose the latter.  For a few bucks more, I got a brand new razor, new trimmer, and longer battery life - thanks to the lithium-ion battery.  I absolutely love the fact that the head can be rinsed off in water too.  Scrap the blades and go for the new razor...you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco razors for about 40 years and have always been pleased, so much so that I won&#x27;t buy any other brand.  My most recent purchase (Norelco PT730) is very disappointing.  At first glance all seems great, new modern design, can be rinsed in water etc... but when using it I find there is practically no power to the blades so they barely spin.  I tried using it for about a month but have now gone back to using my old razor and am happier with that.  I wish I could recommend this product but I can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Works great! Closer shaves than my old Norelco which I had for 15+ years. Only drawback I can see is that the body is plastic and [[ASIN:B006GQYSGO Philips Norelco PT730 PowerTouch Rechargeable Cordless Razor, Black/Silver]] not last as long as the old razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d used a Remington foil shaver for years.  When the foils needed replacing (expensive), I looked for an alternative.  Choose the Norelco even though I&#x27;d shied away from rotary shavers before.  Walmart had a Norelco (lower price/features) on Fathers&#x27; Day sale.  Searched reviews here and was pleasantly surprised.  Works like a dream, smooth shave, quiet operation, water clean-up, and fast charging.  It did take about a month for my face to get used to the new shaver but then it&#x27;s faster and (I think) shaves smoother than the Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only 1 feature needs improvement, so I would rate this shaver 4 1/2 stars:  The sideburn trimmer swivels up rather than Remington&#x27;s which slides up.  Because of the hinge on the Norelco trimmer, you can only drag it down on your face; you cannot move it up &amp; down, it wants to swivel back down if you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I recommend this shaver despite the trimmer issue.</li>
    <li> I like this razor so much, that I also bought one for my teenage son.  The pivoting heads really make it a close shave.  Great battery life as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. He tends to use  his face as a racetrack and the razor as a race car.  I&#x27;ve never seen anyone shave like he does. I&#x27;m surprised the whiskers have time to be cut!  It does do a good job and it does an even better job when he slows down.</li>
    <li> I have tried other types of electric shavers and have found this brand to be the best for a close shave and all around use.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a replacement for the AT830 model I returned to Amazon.  This unit is capable of both corded (plugged in) and cordless operation where the AT830 is strictly and charge and use cordless model.  The PT730 provides a good close cut - no burn or irriation noticed (although I have used Norelco electrics for nearly 17 years so I am used to them).  This is my fourth Norelco and they seem to keep improving them and adding features as the years go by.  This one is smaller and lighter in weight than my previous one - probably due to the switch in battery power (lithium ion as opposed to nickel cadium).  Blades are not quite as sturdy as previous models but still get the job done.  All in all I am very happy and the extra good news is this model was nearly $30 cheaper than the AT830.  Go figure!!  I would highly recommend this as very versatile electric razor.</li>
    <li> Bought this back in Dec 2012 and it has been used daily since. I haven&#x27;t changed the razors and it still works nicely. It has been shorting out lately, where it&#x27;ll just stop working for a bit or the green light will flash for hours. I rinse it under hot water as the instructions recommend, not sure why it&#x27;s misbehaving. Perhaps it&#x27;s not destined to last more than a year or so? I might have to buy another... soon.</li>
    <li> Very nice, quiet and seems to hold a charge a long time so far.  I shaves nicely and I like the fact that you can run it corded if the battery does go low.</li>
    <li> This shaver feels a little lightweight and the revolutions seem a little slow, but it does deliver an adequate shave.  For the $49 it cost me, I realize I shouldn&#x27;t expect it to be much of a rugged shaver.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for mu husband about a year or two ago and he loves it. Says it helps to give him a close shave and is relatively quite compared to other brand shavers he has used.</li>
    <li> The razor certainly could be a little heavier and more sturdy feeling, however it works well and does a good job compared to others I have used.</li>
    <li> I had put in a 5 star review originally after 3 weeks of owning this product, worked great, and I was satisfied.  Well after 4 months, this thing is toast, it started acting funny shutting off inexplicably.  Next the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge long enough to shave.  Finally, after that it wouldn&#x27;t charge at all and does not even work while plugged in.  I never abused it, dropped it, or otherwise failed to care for it.  Judging by the reviews, which are largely positive, I just got unlucky.  I never have given a 1 star rating before, but wanted to put this out there to warn people not so much not to buy it, but to save your packaging material (which I did not) in case you have to send it back.  I guess I am just stuck.</li>
    <li> It really shaves closer than my old electric razor.  It has a good weight and holds well in the hand.</li>
    <li> It arrived quickly and has all the features of the older model we were replacing.  It has a really quick charge.</li>
    <li> My Braun foil razor died after years of service and this Philips Norelco had the features I wanted. After using the Norelco rotary shaver for several weeks I feel the foil shaver gives a better shave in half the time because the foil cutting surface is much broader than the small rotary blades. Where I could get a good shave in 5 minutes with the Braun it takes 10 minutes going over and over the same area with the Norelco. Also the shaver I received would not charge but Philips excellent customer service replaced it right away.</li>
    <li> I have been using electric razors for many years and while I accepted less than close shave there was no mess with cream and blood!  This razor is amazing.  Extremely close shave from the first use.  It is so quiet I thought there was something wrong until I felt how smooth my face was!  I am so pleased with this item and it is easy to rinse clean.  Plus you can run it with the cord if ncessary when a charge is needed or use the quick charge option.Feels good in your hand and easy to use.  Great product. UPDATE10-18-17  Still working great but have replaced the blades.</li>
    <li> Meets expectations for the price.  Charges quickly and holds charge for a long time.  Heads are good for a closer shave.</li>
    <li> great shaving experience.  This is my third Norelco razor.  They last for years. I would buy it over any other brand.  AAAA</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for about two weeks and I am very satisfied with its performance. Although it is of a less-substantial and less-durable design than the three-head Norelco shaver I owned many years ago, it is more than adequate for cleaning up the stubble on my face not covered by my beard and moustache. With just a quick pass over those areas, the three-head design really gives a close shave. My beard grows fast but is of average thickness and has a normal &amp;#34;resistance to shaving quotient.&amp;#34; The flip-up shaing heads are easy to clean with the provided brushes, but I am very careful not to brush too vigorously for fear of breaking some vital plastic part therein. The charging system (AC cord with built-in step-down transformer) is easy to use and packs up neatly in the storage pouch I provided. I would say that I am not a typical user in that I only use the shaver for touch-ups every other day. For that reason, I probably won&#x27;t have to replace the cutting heads assembly within one year as suggested by the manufacturer. If you want a more durable, more powerful and longer-lasting shaver (which THIS model is decidedly NOT), you should go for one of the more expensive high-end shavers. As with most electrically powered appliances, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Very smooth shave no nicks. Get Electra shave lotion. Gets a better shave. Very happy the electric razor. Follow charging hints.</li>
    <li> Previous to this purchase I owned a Norelco 3405LC electric shaver for the last 15 years or so. The PT730 is a FAR superior shaver. The 3405LC caused &amp;#34;razor burn&amp;#34; far too frequently on my neck if I skipped shaving for several days; it was noisy, and also required multiple passes to effectively shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In stark contrast the PT730 is quiet, the rotors swivel to fit my face/neck contours, and it shaves with a couple circular passes over an area. Wish the 3405LC had broken sooner!!!.</li>
    <li> It is okay and it is less than what I looked for but I certainly use it for now. Not bad to buy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as good as I expected it to be I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it,sadly.i&#x27;m going to stick to a old fashioned razor!</li>
    <li> Good shave with this Norelco</li>
    <li> This electric razor more than met my expations  is very glad I purchased this raz0r my experience with the razor is so good that I will recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Great quality and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Got this for my father in law for christmas and let me say he is a very picky man. He liked this shaver a lot. He uses it at least a couple times a week and has had it for awhile now and it still works great. Have not heard him complain a single time about it.</li>
    <li> This is a very quiet and effective shaver. I tried another brand but was not happy. So back to what I know works on thick stubble.</li>
    <li> If you compare this product to some &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; razors I have been using, it is super comfortable and way more effective. The contoured design makes it like a massage when you shave your face. And some little hairs on my neck which can not be trimmed off by a &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; razor pose no problem to this Philips PT730 razor.</li>
    <li> Razor works as well as advertised, I would have no problem buying another one.It did not take long to charge.</li>
    <li> Hi all,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the good reviews, its just ok.  The motor is not as strong as my previous Norelco (wish I didn&#x27;t throw it away!) and that was the key difference between a quicker shave and a slower one.  I hope this lasts as long as my last one, but I remained brand loyal to Norelcos since the last one had a long service life.</li>
    <li> Great razor, great shave. Used it for years with no problems.</li>
    <li> I had bought the same razor about a year ago and lost it on a trip. It came with a charging stand that was very convenient.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco for a long time and found it to be the best shaver.  One I got from amazon was great I love it.</li>
    <li> I hate having to buy replacement heads so often.  It costs about the same to buy a new razor as it does to buy two replacement heads.  So I usually buy a new razor every other time.</li>
    <li> Nice product for the money, easy to use.  Delivery was quick.  If you want an inexpensive shaver that is just fine, nothing great, this is the one</li>
    <li> I did not able to get close shave with this shaver it miss many areas in addition it causes skin irritation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Panasonic and this both has same problems so I am going to try Braun next</li>
    <li> My old Norelco had worn out.  It ran fine but the cutting heads were dull.  The new shaver really cuts close and saves me a lot of time shaving.</li>
    <li> Does everything i expected well.It cuts well on the neck area. The shaver is a good value for the money.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco razors for many years. I think this is the best one yet. After a couple days of break-in use it gives me very close shaves. I know it is a closer shave than I used to get with my older razors because by evening my face is still much smoother than what it used to be. It is very easy to handle and move about my face. It is also very easy to clean with the pop open top. I shave every morning and the battery charge lasted for over five weeks.</li>
    <li> Everything is in box, not difficult to use, would buy it again if needed too.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommed it to anyone looking for a reasonably priced shaver.</li>
    <li> It was just as I expected it to be. It was great! It helps me to be ontime and is very valueable</li>
    <li> Suddenly stopped working..........waiting for Phillips to send a return mailer so we can return it to them for repairs (if can be repaired).  Husband enjoyed it while working, but shouldn&#x27;t have quit working so soon.</li>
    <li> This is a really good razor and would suggest to others to buy it. It gives me a nice clean shave.</li>
    <li> Hubs is pleased, but disappointed in the quality of electric shavers in general. The price was excellent, so low that he decided to use the savings to invest in a spare head. The feel of this shaver is less solid than his older model, but it charges quickly. More of a disposable appliance rather than an investment.</li>
    <li> What more can I say, here is a product that I really love and have had them since I was a teenager.  (One Remington, did I get, and when the head wore out, it bit me!)  These are quality products and this battery rechargeable model is great!</li>
    <li> Cuts the whiskers just fine.  Charging time is a bit lengthy however, so I just leave it plugged in over night. Like the other reviews, the motor seems to run slower than my old razor, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to affect the whisker cutting ability.</li>
    <li> I had the luck to find this shaver on Amazon Vine, and since I use shavers, this was perfect for me!  I&#x27;ve previously bought a Philips Norelco 7310, [[ASIN:B001AJ6YS2 Philips Norelco 7310 Men&#x27;s Shaving System]], but to tell you the truth, they&#x27;re pretty much the same shaver (which isn&#x27;t a bad thing, mind you).  Uses the same heads, has the pop-up trimmer, slightly different contour, but even the cleaning brush is identical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what I liked about this.&lt;br /&gt;Lithium ion batter is good, which means it won&#x27;t have problems with frequent use and recharge, and also means you can use as a travel charger, since the battery won&#x27;t self-discharge too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean.  Pop the button on the bottom of the head, and the head/screen flips up (but is still connected to the shaver).  This allows you to clean the head and blades without losing or dropping the head.  I&#x27;ve dropped the screen a few times using Braun and Remington screen shavers, and have almost cut myself wiping those blades.  Shouldn&#x27;t be a problem with this Norelco shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple pop-up trimmer.  I also use this when I get the stray wiry beard whisker that you just can&#x27;t fit into the screen to shave off.  The pop-up trimmer is a bit loud and vibrates a bit more than I expect, but it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so likes:&lt;br /&gt;The brush doesn&#x27;t attach to the shaver, so you KNOW I&#x27;ll be losing this brush in a month or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No pouch/case/bag/anything.  Usually, I&#x27;d at least get a vinyl bag or plastic case, but here, nothing.  Maybe the retail version will come with something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, recommended, especially for its price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s also the Norelco PT720 [[ASIN:B006GQYSFA Philips Norelco PT720 PowerTouch Rechargeable Cordless Razor, Blue/Silver/Black]], which goes for about 10-15 bucks cheaper, but you lose the pop-up trimmer.  And there&#x27;s always the Norelco 7310, they&#x27;re still sold at Amazon via Reseller.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: I am reviewing a unit I received for free through the Vine program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. And I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for over 25 years, since the mid 1980&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to try other brands with different technologies. People swore by Braun so I got a Braun; in fact I went through several Braun shavers. I thought it was just me, that I was having so much difficulty getting a close comfortable shave quickly.... I thought it was just me, having so much trouble cleaning all the gnarled tangled hair around the blades..... I&#x27;d replace the foils but it wouldn&#x27;t help much, etc. I used to have to use the popup trimmer just because the regular shaver simply would not catch/cut some stubborn hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I got one of these (I started with the previous model, before getting this newest one). Wow, what a difference! Very close shave, very comfortably, and very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And afterwards, don&#x27;t even have to scrape, to clean it -- just shake and rinse, and all the hair just falls right out, because of the design; no hair gets tangled in the blades at all, it all falls into the receptacle area, ready to shake out.</li>
    <li> Holds a charge longer than any other brand, weeks at a time. Decent shave. Good product. I would recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor to replace a Remington rotary that although still works perfectly well has to be kept on charge and even then the battery is only good for one shave.&lt;br /&gt;Out of the box and charged up the PT730 felt nicer in the hand and was quieter, though the pop up trimmer feels a bit cheap and rattly.&lt;br /&gt;Then on to the important bit, shaving. First impression was the lack of glide, it just felt awkward. More importantly was the lack of closeness. OK, this is a different make to my old one and maybe technique could improve the closeness after a bit more use but I persevered for about 10 minutes covering the same areas many times till it was obvious that it wasn&#x27;t going to get any closer. Out of curiosity I tried then with the old Remington and knew as soon as I heard the cutting noise that I had downgraded to a less efficient razor.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these, one for myself and one for my dad.  They both work great. I get a nice smooth shave every time.  They don&#x27;t get quite as close as a 3 blade manul razor on the neck, but I haven&#x27;t found any electric razor that does that area like a razor and shaving cream does.  The shave on the rest of my face is excellent though.  The battery lasts a long time, I am still running on the first charge, but I only shave every other day due to skin issues.  Even with sensitive skin, my face has not been irritated using this razor.</li>
    <li> I have the more expensive Norelco&#x27;s and needed an extra shaver for travel use. This unit is as good as their spendy units.</li>
    <li> My old shaver would not hold a charge for more than one shave. I orderd this one because I was going on a fishing trip where I would not have electricity for a week and I wanted a shaver that would last that long on one charge. I got this one on May 13, charged it and as of May 31 it is still running strong on the initial charge....18 days and counting. Wow!&lt;br /&gt;The shave is excellent as well, good and close without chaffing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers for over thirty years.  The quality isn&#x27;t nearly what it used to be.  My last two Norelco shavers have died before the warranty was up.  I wouldn&#x27;t be a bit surprised if this one does the same.  Norelco pretty much owns this market.  Maybe if they had some serious competition they would have to work on their quality.  As it is, I just keep buying their products and plan on having to take them up on their warranty replacement.  So far they&#x27;ve been good about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ron Clark</li>
    <li> I have used electric shavers all my life. Most of them were Norelco products. This one is, by far, the best one yet. It holds a charge for over a week. Very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I have not used an electric for 30 years but I had a a slight rash I kept cutting with my regular razor so I thought I would try this. It shave pretty closely (I gave up on them years ago because I wanted a closer shave). I am retired now and this is so easy to use it keeps me from letting myself look &amp;#34;shabby&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Works decently&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Works only decently&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this shaver to replace an older, crappier one that had non-replaceable battery charge issues. Loved that it worked right out of the box, and I could use it while charging. It allows you to shave with a good length of stubble, and only leaves a few stubborn stragglers. The only problems I have stem from the course-grinder popout shaver being really cheap/weak, and the fact that this face-conforming system seems to encourage skin blemish problems, in addition to making it hard to eliminate any stray stubble hairs. It works well, not great; but it&#x27;s so cheap that it&#x27;s totally worth it. This is a much better design than all of those replaceable-head models</li>
    <li> The best Norelco I have ever owned.  It gives a perfect shave everytime and it takes half the time of the my old razor.</li>
    <li> My old Norelco finally failed after about 8 years of daily use.  I replaced it with this Norelco and so far, after a week, all is going exceedingly well.  Unit is comfortable to hold, I get a nice close shave with no pulling, cleanup is easy, and it charges rapidly.  Head pops open for easy cleaning.  Head can be rinsed off with flowing water also (though I tend not to do this as it can form clumps eventually).  Razor is not noisy either.</li>
    <li> i tried a lot of electric shavers and never liked them very much this shaver is the best by far</li>
    <li> but i feel shaved not thoroughly as i expected,need almost same time to get face and jaw clean with my really old cheap philips two head razor.the obvious advantage is can wash by water you don&#x27;t afraid the electronic components get dysfunction.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it two days, too soon to fully rate it. The instructions recommend give it a three week trial.</li>
    <li> My past two razors were top-of-the-line Braun and Panasonic- nifty bells and whistles, elaborate cleaning systems.  but frankly, I got tired of the obscenely expensive replacement heads and cleaning liquids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..so I decided to try Norelco again, a brand I gave up on years ago as just not giving a close enough shave.  They also have a very expensive model, which I bypassed for a style which cost less complete than the deluxe&#x27;s replacement heads.  It did, however, offer floating heads and easily washable cutting surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..well, after a couple of months, what can I say but YES!  Not only completely non-irritating, but surprise surprise the CLOSEST electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had- all for less than $50!  The only downside is charging takes eight hours rather than 30 minutes, but so what?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..definitely a case where less is more!</li>
    <li> I have had Norelco&#x27;s before &amp; liked them.  This one even though cuts the beard short, if you don&#x27;t keep rinsing &amp; cleaning after every shave, it can burn your skin after using the next time.</li>
    <li> I have had this for about 3 months now and I love it.  It almost makes shaving enjoyable, almost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very quiet, so your initial thought is that there Is no way this is going to work well.  That impression is wrong, it works wonderfully.  I shave ever other day and over the 3 months I have only charged this 2 times, so the battery life is very good.  If you use electric shavers, this is a great buy that performs well.</li>
    <li> Does a good job cutting but when charging it takes 8 hours every time,although it will give you a shave if nessary in 3 minutes,for me the charge last 14 days of 3 minute shaves.Very good for a decent price.</li>
    <li> Pretty good, our first electric shaver, but not that great.  Kind of weak.  We don&#x27;t recommend it.  Cheap, but probably not worth it.</li>
    <li> I used this twice, and just went back to my razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair I guess it&#x27;s not bad, and the price isn&#x27;t too bad. But I just wasn&#x27;t getting good shaves, it seemed to cut hair pretty close, but it would miss hairs entirely leaving a look worse than just not shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end I just splashed some water on my face and shaved the rest with my razor. Probably good in a pinch, but will never be a daily driver for me.</li>
    <li> Found this razor to work well  after  a few days got a good clean shave...also easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t review the razor because it was a birthday gift and the person who was gifted has not used it yet</li>
    <li> This is only my first electric razor, but I&#x27;m not impressed. It takes a while to remove the hair, and the shave isn&#x27;t that close.</li>
    <li> I love it. I received it very fast and on time. It is new. This my is my third one. I have used this over the year. I have over 5 year each of this product.</li>
    <li> This shaver was purchased for sons birthday...he was so pleased.  Upon examining the gift,  his two married brothers were visibly jelouse and admitted it was a good gift.</li>
    <li> I &#x27;ve had other Norelco shavers, always been good, so I&#x27;m happy and I know it! (clap my hands) okay</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to shop and I hate shopping so Amazon has come through for me again. This shaver replaces a Norelco he already had. This model does not seem to be as good quality as former ones, but it shaves great and he likes the way it fits in his hand. I hope it lasts as long as his other Norelcos.</li>
    <li> This product is not worth buying. I bought it and used it about 3 months to the day and it stopped while I was shaving. Luckily I still had my old cordless and went back to using it. Amazon says you can&#x27;t return it after 30 days....REALLY?? Why would anyone think a razor should only last 30 days. This should have at least a 6 month return window if not 1 year. I truly like Amazon and have had mostly good experiences, but this purchase has changed how I view Amazon and not in a good way. Please consider offering a longer return window. Wal-Mart has a longer return policy than this!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my 1st electic shaver in 30+ years of shaving.  I&#x27;ve always wanted to try one as an alternative to razor blades and cream.  With all of the different types, styles, models, etc. it always overwhelmed me as to what would work the best for me.  After doing another round of researching the Norelco PT730 seemed to offer a mix of value and performance based on reviews.  After 4 months in the world of electric razoring, I find it works just fine for me.  I actually use it everyday where I might only have shaved with a blade every other day if I could get away with it.  As I have nothing to compare it to, I am so far pretty happy with the quality and shave I get for the price.  I&#x27;m on my 1st set of blades and replacements are almost as much as the entire unit, but I&#x27;ll probably keep using them until it quits me.  I&#x27;m the same guy who uses a small binder clip on my toothpaste to get every drop, so trust me, I&#x27;ll get the most out of this razor.  The charge seems to last at least a couple of weeks and does have a light on the charger so I know when it is charged (pretty quickly).  I bought the companion Norelco QT4000/42 Beard Trimmer and they have two different wall wart chargers (which sort of sucks) but I plug them both in the morning and I&#x27;m packing a charge for a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again- without ever having another electric razor to compare this to, as a cheap first time razor, it works for me.</li>
    <li> Does a good job on those tough whiskers.  Finally found a good electric razor.  Holds Charge.  Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I finally found my better half an electric razor that made him toss his razors!!!!  This item was reasonably priced even without their $5.00 instant coupon. It is easy to maneuver and provides a nice shave without pulling any hairs.  This will definitely save you money in the long run.  It will pay for itself after three 10 packs of disposable razor cartridges.</li>
    <li> It did not agree with my face. Shaving daily required and skin was irritated. Shave was grown in by dinner.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband for Christmas. He likes it and I can tell it gives a smooth shave. He ranked it a 5 star.</li>
    <li> This razor lasted 2 weeks and it quit running so I returned it for another one and it worked for 1 week and quit. Amazon let me return both for a refund. They may have just got a bad bunch. I order a Panasonic and it works great anc shaves closer then the Norelco.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best shaver I have ever had.  When my 10 year old Norelco began to die and the heads were more expensive than a new shaver I decided to get a new one.  But before I bought this one I bought three others, two Remingtons and a Braan.  I wound up giving them all away and kept going back to my old Norelco.  But this is far better, no pulling and snagging. and the rotary head is silky smooth on my face.  I have a very bristly beard and it is hard to get a smooth close shave.  Not any more.  This Norelco is great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several electric razors over the years and also of different brands. This one is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever had the pleasure to use. Having a beard tuff enough to use as sandpaper, my razors need either new blades frequently or just burn out.&lt;br /&gt; Having used this razor for many weeks now I can certainly say it works. A 3 day beard is no challenge. It&#x27;s fast, quiet, very easy to clean and very effective.&lt;br /&gt; And darn reasonable to purchase. A true bargain.</li>
    <li> I would recomend it to everyone great batt life and great cutting and will probably last a very long time</li>
    <li> Holds a charge a lot longer than expected. Quality product for moderate price. Easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a wonderful and amazing razor. It makes me feel clean and tidy and the price is reasonable! The razor is comfortable feel when I use it.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift, and my Dad loves it! Says it feels good against the skin, and likes the option of using cordlessly or plugged.</li>
    <li> I t works very well! It gives me a clean shave with out any irritation and the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC RAZOR. IT DOES A GREAT JOB AND IT DELIVERS A QUALITY SHAVE EACH AND EVERY TIME. I WOULD DEFINITELY PURCHASE ANOTHER NORELCO PRODUCT BASED ON THIS BUYING EXPERIENCE.</li>
    <li> razor is very good, dependable, performs and charges as advertised. Only deficiency it has no stand so as to take less counter space and be handier.  I use an old Norelco stand from a previous model which performs this function for me fine. I would urge Norelco to include a stand with this model.</li>
    <li> Easy to hold and gives a clean close cut.  Charge holds for a good length of time between shaves.  Would recommend purchase.</li>
    <li> I have had many razors before this is my sixth Norelco and this one pulls the whiskers a lot. Its not the smoothest but it is okay for me to use.Dont know if I would buy another one after this.</li>
    <li> This is an inexpensive model and I&#x27;ve found that you get what you pay for.  The shave is mediocre and requires several passes to achieve a moderately good shave.  Save your money.  Buy a much better upgraded shaver and get better results.</li>
    <li> Purchased a PT730 and it never did shave  close, after over 50 years with good Norelco experience.  It ran past the 45 day trial period, so I couldn&#x27;t send it back.  The pop up trimmer shaved closer than did the cutters, and it came in a sealed container, so it was new.  I then ordered a 7380XL, which cost about twice as much, but it shaves closer than a blade, so my faith in Norelco is restored.  They both use the  HQ8 cutters, so that is a mystery as to why they are different.</li>
    <li> Works just okay and it takes forever to shave (can take up to 15 minutes) and I&#x27;m not a hairy person. It&#x27;s not nearly as close as the other electrical razors I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> ok ive had this thing for 3 months now so i think i know what ive got here. i works. it doesnt pull too often, it gives a pretty close shave, and it cleans up pretty nice... but the trimmer is a piece of garbage. dont expect your edge lines to be nice at all. i had to order a new beard trimmer, cause it takes 3 or 4 tries to get anything close to desirable.</li>
    <li> The shaver provides a close shave and the battery lasts a long time between charges (still haven&#x27;t recharged after about two weeks). The groomer is a plus. Good price but would like a charging base and case.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shaver.  Much better than the classic thin foil design of other brands which take longer to shave plus the thin foil wears through on my beard after a short time.  I&#x27;ve had Norelco models in the past and this is the best I&#x27;ve had although I haven&#x27;t tried their high end models.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this razor to work!  Alas, the only way to get any hair shaved off my face with this thing is to rub hard over the same spot over-and-over.  This makes my face red and irritated so I don&#x27;t do it often. The only &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; my powertouch has demonstrated is (1) the power to take my money; and (2) the power to irritate my face.  Truthfully, I think all of us who purchase these more reasonably priced electric razors need to stop fooling ourselves and either fork out the money for an expensive electric razor or just stick with the manual razors.</li>
    <li> Just got it.  A few shaves in, and it is very comfortable and effective.  Too early to tell yet about reliability.</li>
    <li> This is my first rotating-head-style shaver.  However, I bought it mainly because I finally wanted to have a portable shaver with a lithium battery since my older Panasonic had the usual nickel-cadmium piece of junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the shaver does seem to last quite a while on a single charge, though, since it&#x27;s new, that&#x27;s to be expected.  The biggest issue for me with electric shavers is that my beard is light -- I only need to shave a few times a week -- and my innate laziness about shaving regularly leaves me with isolated stubble that&#x27;s grown so long it usually folds beneath the foil of a shaver and never gets chopped off.  Which forces me to shave with a razor and foam to get back to a clean-shaven face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rotating-head shaving experience is definitely odd.  In particular, I find this shaver isn&#x27;t especially good at getting stubble just below my nose ... conventional straight-foil shavers seem to do that better.  (I&#x27;ve since learned to adjust how I hold the shaver to get that nasally challenged beard.)  And, to be honest, I&#x27;m not really sure how good it is getting stubble that&#x27;s grown to a certain length because the shaver&#x27;s reliability on a single charge has prompted me to shave more often.  (Recent experience suggests it *does* do better than my previous shavers at chopping off longer stubble.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I seem to get a half-dozen shaves on a single charge, and the shaver thoughtfully uses the charging light as a warning signal -- ordinarily off when not being charged, it will start to flash when the charge is running low.  It&#x27;s also surprisingly quiet.  The first time I used it I was afraid I hadn&#x27;t charged it long enough, but in the absence of other evidence I&#x27;ve concluded that the rotating-head system appears to require less horsepower from the motor, which means I can actually listen to the radio while shaving in the morning ... a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, overall, I&#x27;m satisfied and can certainly recommend this Philips Norelco to anyone with a light beard like mine.  Those with reliable 5-o&#x27;clock shadows will have to read someone else&#x27;s review to know for sure if this shaver is for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelcos my entire life for shaving and this is my 3rd one. They all work about the same in my opinion except that the newer ones run much longer on one charge. These are reliable workhorses that gets the job done with very low maintenance. I just flip open the top after each shave and dump the contents in my sink. For more thorough cleaning, I&#x27;ll rinse the head over the sink and dry it off with a towel. Other than that, I change the shaving heads once a year.</li>
    <li> And I needed a replacement and this seemed like the simplest replacement that I could buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving is smooth, the saving is complete and the clean-up is easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco is the best shaver on the market!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent portable razor it does all of the things I need and has the power to last. It is a very good value</li>
    <li> The charging indication is much improved. At least while new, the battery charge lasts for many days. This is the lowest cost current model that has a trimmer. Perhaps it is slightly noisier than some of its predecessors that I have used. I had preferred the original scheme of an internal charger with a plain detachable power cord instead of yet another &amp;#34;wall wart&amp;#34; that is more awkward to pack. That factor makes me lean to 4 instead of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This shaver I bought for my husband and he says that it is great.  We would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> i have been a norelco user since the 60s and the still make the best razors ! they really make a solid product.</li>
    <li> it really works well. I usually shave when driving because I don&#x27;t want to get up early. This one helps</li>
    <li> The razor was great for a few months. But then, the cutters started to disintegrate while I was cleaning them with a soft brush.&lt;br /&gt;I had Norelco razors for many years and never run into this type of problem.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver because the one I had was about 4 years old and I thought it wasn&#x27;t shaving as close as I could with a new one.  When I bought the old one it was a super close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this one doesn&#x27;t shave any closer than the one I already have and I haven&#x27;t changed the head on the old one ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing is like it used to be.</li>
    <li> Good razor for money. Not the closest shave, but I am satisfied so far. And here are six more words.</li>
    <li> Replaced an ancient Norelco razor whose battery had about given out (it still works plugged into AC power. After the first few months the NEW Norelco works very well and holds it charge well. Price and delivery were as advertised: GOOD!</li>
    <li> Not the Norelco of old but does a good job none the less, I recomend this electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;I do like the water cleanup feature.</li>
    <li> Cuts well and leaves a clean face.  I had a similarly priced Norelco that did not perform so well.  The battery lasts probably two weeks&lt;br /&gt;and seems strong.  Everything about the shaver exceeds my expectations.</li>
    <li> I now have 4 Norelco Razors, dating back over 12 years. One is a AA battery operated that I keep in my brief case to &amp;#34;clean up&amp;#34; when on the road. It does a better job than the PT730.&lt;br /&gt;The blade speed on the PT730 is way too slow to be effective. I&#x27;m estimating it to be 50% of the speed of my older Norelco&#x27;s, which just doesn&#x27;t get the job done. I am now replacing the rechargeable batteries in my older units.</li>
    <li> Good shaver, when you shave everyday, has great battery life, easy cleaning. Holds a charge for at least 2 weeks. Charges quick.</li>
    <li> This razor works just as good as the previous model I had but was much less expensive. I dropped my other one I had for about 5 years. It had a head that had more flex. ( Rocks back and forth) Other than that, it shaves just as well for a lot less money. I also like the fact that I can use it with the cord if the battery happens to go dead. Good deal for the money.</li>
    <li> I use one for my face and Head, and got one for the wife&#x27;s legs... it does a great job and hold its charge!!!</li>
    <li> got this  as a gift its a great razor shaves awesome I love it use it daily with no problems</li>
    <li> This is the smoothest razor I&#x27;ve owned no pinching or pulling. I would recommend it for anyone who wants a comfortable electric shave.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. He read the instructions and it mentioned that if you haven&#x27;t shaved with an electric razor before your skin may be irritated for the first month of use. I feel like &amp;#34;irritated&amp;#34; was kind of an understatement. His skin was really red and splotchy and he was clearly uncomfortable every time he used it, and after two weeks decided it wasn&#x27;t even worth waiting out the month to see if his skin would adjust. My guess is that everyone will react differently to this product based on skin sensitivity, but I thought it was worth sharing his experience.</li>
    <li> This is my third electric shaver in 20 years and the Philips Norelco shavers keep improving in performance.  The PT730 is well manufactured, heavy duty and delivers the closest shave yet.  I am also happy with the extended warranty that is made possible by registering the shaver online.  Overall, a great electric shaver for a relatively low cost.</li>
    <li> It was working well when I first got it, I acquired it last summer. Nowadays it won&#x27;t shave like it used to. It takes a long time to shave the facial hair off. It is going to work different for every person but it has potential. The Norelco Advantage 6705 X lasted me a long time and was better at shaving deeper. The thing that happened with that one though is that I had to leave it in a storage room for about for about six months and so the battery&#x27;s life went out so I had to get this one.</li>
    <li> I never thought I could clean shave in 3 minutes or less.  I make a note of the time I take to shave every time, and its consistently 2-3 minutes.  If I had know this, I&#x27;d have switched from the conventional foam+shave+mess a long time ago.</li>
    <li> Good desicion, very comfortable, practical and economical, I recommend its use. This Appliance is a very good quality, in 25 years I have spent 3 of different models.</li>
    <li> The price was in my range, this razor in particular cost higher, only draw back, it doesn&#x27;t come with a pouch.</li>
    <li> This is my fifth Norelco razor since 1973. I&#x27;ve been pleased with every one of them and this is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;Gives a close shave, holds a long charge, has pop up trimmer and fits well in your hand. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I found over the three-week test period that this razor, although it was nice to my skin, shaved me less and less closely (rather than more and more closely).  I contacted Philips through their website/chat and asked to return the razor (they give you 45 days from the date of purchase).  They were very friendly and told me the form would be sent to me via email in three days or less.  That was nearly three weeks ago.  I have contacted them three times since, in every instance getting friendly assurance that the form would be sent out, and I still do no have it.  It is obvious that they do not intend to honor their offer.  I will never even consider another Philips Norelco razor and will be hesitant about all Philips products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I still cannot recommend purchasing this razor but after a couple of months of contacting them and repeatedly explaining that the reason it wasn&#x27;t returned earlier is that they didn&#x27;t email me the form I needed to be able to return it--like they repeatedly promised--they finally sent me the right paperwork and I have been reimbursed.  I paid $49.95, it cost me ~$10 to return it (they insisted on insured mailing which would have been ~$45 so I ignored that \\&quot;requirement\\&quot;) and they sent my original purchase back so it cost me time and about $10 neither of which I will ever get back.  If you do decide to purchase this product, make sure you don&#x27;t use it for the full \\&quot;testing\\&quot; period before deciding whether or not to keep it--make sure you decide in enough time to return it to Amazon and not to Philips.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my husband and he loves it.</li>
    <li> The razor works as advertised. It hasn&#x27;t nicked me at all and I get a good shave. I like the waterproof feature as it is fast and simple to clean. I would buy it again if it keeps working as it is now.</li>
    <li> My husband never had an electric razor before.  This shaver gives him a close shave without the nicks and cuts he was getting with a blade.</li>
    <li> the electric razor is very good! but it is not made in USA as description online. I don&#x27;t know why.</li>
    <li> Great shaved I have had many this one performs great lightweight and easy to clean to because it is washable.great products.</li>
    <li> I never even used an electric razor before, but when I saw the price on this one, I figured what the heck. Now I&#x27;m kicking myself for not switching from blades a long time ago. After about three shaves I found it to be as close as a blade. And I can shave while I&#x27;m watching TV!! Cleaning it is super easy. I have yet to charge it and it keeps going and going.&lt;br /&gt;Buy one! You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a cordless electric razor again after shaving with a blade razor for many years.  I received the Phillips Norelco PT730/41 for Christmas 2014 and have not gone back to a razor since then.  After using this razor for almost seven months, I can say I am pleased with the results.  I was initially a little concerned because the motor sounds weaker compared to cordless razors I have used in the past, but I have been able to use this one without ever resorting to pulling out my blade razor to remove stubborn neck hairs.  It runs smoothly and my face is nicely shaved when I am done.  I am dark-haired, but I don&#x27;t feel like I need to shave again later that afternoon as I have read in other reviews.  Once in the morning has worked fine.  My only complaint is that the razor does not seem to hold a charge for as long as it did during the first five months of use.  I could let it go for five shaves before recharging it, but after a couple of times of having the razor stall upon turning it on, I now recharge it after three shaves.</li>
    <li> I was absolutely amazed. I have used Norelco Razors for years and years. I really didn&#x27;t think it could be improved on but I was&lt;br /&gt;dead wrong. I never enjoyed shaving but now it&#x27;s almost a pleasure. The fastest, closest shave you could ever hope for.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, no complaints whatsoever. Long battery life, great hold, very light.</li>
    <li> not a good shave and my neck breaks out in a burning red rash after each use. it is in the garbage now.</li>
    <li> Does an adequate job but tends to pull long whisker;  it Is also hard to clean,following the instructions, hair still clings to the razor after washing..</li>
    <li> I have wet shaved for over 50 years.  I have had a few electric razors in the past, but was so dissatisfied that I soon returned or discarded them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for travel in my RV where shaving is more than an annoyance and water is in short supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect much and was totally unprepared for how good and smooth the shave is.  Maybe not quite close as blade shave, but still good enough to retire the razor and shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially appreciate not having to use a pre shave lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love the fact  that the battery seems to last forever.  I shaved every day for two and a half weeks before the low battery indicator finally came on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am totally delighted with the Philips Norelco PT730 Powertouch.</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of Norelco, but this shaver just does not cut.  My husband has a light beard stubble, so he only shaves every other day.  No wonder, it takes him almost a half hour to finally get the stubble off his face.  Even then his face is not smooth.  I am getting ready to contact Norelco about returning this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have even a medium beard stubble do not get this shaver.</li>
    <li> Never gave a close shave.  Called the company and they did send new replacement blades but they did not work either.</li>
    <li> I am 55 and so have been shaving for many years.  I also have used both razors and electric and on the electric side I have used a foil shaver and now this.  This is my favorite shaving experience so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A razor will give you the closest shave, of course, but electric shavers are convenient and quick.  I switched to electric about ten years ago.  As to the electric experience, I now enjoy the convenience, lack of  a mess, and not needing to always replenish shaving gear (foam or gel and blades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a Braun foil shaver, which gave me a good shave, be seemed to be requiring head replacements about every 6 months, which made it very expensive to operate.  I saw the good reviews on this shaver and decided to go rotary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impression was the comfort of the shave.  I expected the first week to have some discomfort until my face adjusted to the new feel.  But the first time I used it I actually thought that there was some light plastic cover over the heads that I had failed to take off.  This machine is extremely comfortable, even if you are not used to a rotary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next thing I like:  As compared to a foil, this rotary shaves longer hairs with fewer passes and thus shaves more quickly than the Braun foil machine.  I should note I have a moderate beard. It grows fastest on my neck.  This was always a problem with my foil machine.  It would take many passes to get the hairs to pop through the foil and into the cutting head.  With the rotary, the neck goes really fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected a less close shave than the foil.  That is the accepted wisdom.  Maybe I am aberrant, but I found a rotary shave to be just as close, if not closer, Than the foil.  At least that is true for this machine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I REALLY like the ease of cleaning.  Just press a button to flip open the head and run under the tap.  With my Braun, I had to set it into a noisy cleaning station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, great on ease of use, great on quality of shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I have now had the shaver for almost 2 and one half years.  I still like it and would only add that it has passed the durability test.  Still holds a charge for many weeks, and I am just now getting ready to replace the head for the first time.  Good product.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t feel powerful for a quick shave.  It is however very quiet. nicely shaped cleans easily.  Overall a good product.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daddy who was in a nursing home. He loved it.</li>
    <li> I got this razor because I had tried everything for the sensitive skin on my neck - Classic Razors, Modern Razors, &#x27;Sensitive Skin Approved&#x27; Razors, Special Shaving Cream - nothing worked. I read that Phillips Norelco razors work great for sensitive skin. They were right - mostly. I have noticed significantly less bumps on my neck, but I&#x27;ve also noticed if I go more than 2-3 days without shaving I get them as bad as before. If you have sensitive skin like me, you should definitely give this razor a try.</li>
    <li> I was given a $20 electric razor when I was 16, and that is what I used until I was 25.  I finally decided that I should upgrade, and after extensive research I purchased this model.  I was impressed that I can clean this razor by running it under water, and the pivoting head is very nice.  It holds a charge for a very long time (around 8 hours of use) which lasts me at least a month.  I have a beard so I use this razor to shave my neck and part of my face, and I always get a very good, very close shave with no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many comparable razors, but this one works perfectly for me because it isn&#x27;t too expensive, and will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my son-in-law for Christmas. He gave me the particulars on what he wanted and I complied. I must say he loves this razor. He tell me every time he sees me. Mrs. J. McPherson</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my boyfriend and I don&#x27;t know anything about razors or anything like that. This was a great purchase and I bought it based on other people&#x27;s reviews here on Amazon. It is an excellent razor and works very well.</li>
    <li> Gift for my husband.  He loves the Norelco. His older model that he probably has been using for over 10 years, finally gave out.  This one he is very happy with for price, features and it does it&#x27;s job fantastic.</li>
    <li> 15 YEAR OLD FIRST RAZOR.  THANK YOU FOR MAKING A MAN OUT OF HIM.  RECOMMENDED THIS ONE BECAUSE THAT&#x27;S WHAT I HAVE ALWAYS SHAVED WITH. 55 YEARS.</li>
    <li> i am very like it,非常的好,it is very good ,i very like,next time i will be buy it,very good,good,love it.good love</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco razors for 20-30 years. It does a great job without using shaving cream,etc. Also, I never have razor cuts.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my Dad had a Norelco which was passed down to me.  After 35 years it finally wobbled, made strange sounds and I threw it away. So I bought a new one and it is perfect. Does a good job, is quiet and recharges to 40 hours of use - that is impressive.  I like it.</li>
    <li> I got this to give to my father in law when his old razor seemed to give up the ghost.  It wound up working again however so I decided to save it for later - then I thought, heck, I might as well try it out.  It works quite well.  It sits on the side table by my desk so if I need a bit of a touch up during the day it is there.  Gives a good, close shave and is easy to maintain, i.e. open it up and hose it out under the faucet occasionally and plug it in for awhile every once in a while.  Should my father in laws razor actually break down eventually then I would purchase this again to give to him.  Otherwise I don&#x27;t know why I would need to buy another one.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my hospitalized husband on the recommendation of a friend.  My husband really didn&#x27;t want to give up his safety razor and shaving cream, however, that is not allowed in the hospital. So against his preferences, I ordered this Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;He is extremely pleased and continues to use it since returning home.  Goodbye safety razor and foam!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a hate hate relationship with electric razors and this ones no different. I like a close shave whereas electric shavers seem to be for folks who like a slight stubble. By the time I&#x27;ve gone over each area a dozen times trying to get every hair I&#x27;ve already spent more time than I would&#x27;ve needed to lather up and get a super smooth Gillette shave in a couple of strokes. Unimpressed. I would NOT use it if I had an important meeting/engagement/date coming up.</li>
    <li> I get a nice clean shave in about 1/4 the time! It feels good in my hand, and performs even better! I was nervous because I have tried many shavers over the years, and often I didn&#x27;t like them, but this one is GREAT, and FANTASTIC VALUE!</li>
    <li> At first I would have rated it 3 stars.  After using the razor, I rate it as five stars.  It does not shave quite as closely as some, but its shave is wonderful, gentle and thorough.  The almost silent motor sounds weak, but shaves very effectively.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent shave. I switched from my straight razor and have no regrets. You have to be careful with certain edges and curves of your face, but every method has its own strategies.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, low price and great quality! My Flyco got damaged and i bought this. It turned out to be much better than the former one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just updated from a Braun 340 wet/dry, which I was never truly happy with but put up with all the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t until we bought our teenage son a PT720 last year, and I gave it a try, that I found out how much better it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when it came time for a fathers day gift recently, I asked for the updated model, the PT730.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a far better job, and most importantly (for me at least) it doesn&#x27;t pull the hairs at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time will tell whether it keeps up the great job, but for now, I&#x27;m more than happy with the results.</li>
    <li> After 6 mo.of use, still a clean shave and I have had no problems with the amt. of shaves off one charge.</li>
    <li> His old one needed new blades and it was cheaper to get new razor than buy them. He obviously likes this, but prefer a blade shave myself...</li>
    <li> It does the job....  nice close shave.. (legs).... lightweight and very easy to use.. love how it fits in your hand..</li>
    <li> Expected as good or better than my 20 year old Norelco - didn&#x27;t happen. Also, instructions say to clean after each use with running water. Come on!, my old one could go weeks...</li>
    <li> I gave it a full charge and it lasted over a month.  It cuts better than my old one did mostly because of the improved screen designed.  My old one was about 10 years old.  I have tried other brands (Braun) but always go back to Norelco.</li>
    <li> One of the quitest razors I have ever NOT heard and you still get a good close shave.  Highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement for my 20 year old Norelco electric razor.  Close shaves and charges quickly.  I recommend Norelco razors for Norelco users.</li>
    <li> I got my new shaver because new blades for old shaver that I got when my dad died. I could not find new blades, and the ones I needed. The ones I found was almost as much as the cost of this new shaver. I&#x27;m older now and on a aspirin a day to thin my blood and when I cut my self I bleed for a while so I got out Dads electric and it worked but pulled. So after looking on line I got this one and it works GREAT! I love it, it says I can clean with water but I&#x27;m afraid it will screw it up!  A Mountain Boy Ron from Maryland</li>
    <li> Good shave for the price.  I have used Philips Norelco electric razors for many years and plan to continue to do so.</li>
    <li> A five star value for me: a light, no-frills floating-head shaver for my light beard at a great price. But for most users it may seem under powered. Quick faucet cleaning and long lasting charge are important benefits.</li>
    <li> aok.  this razor works fine for me and has very nice features. it is very quiet and efficient. nice handle</li>
    <li> The razor works well &amp; is relatively quiet. The on/off button is in the wrong place, right where you hold it, and I inadvertently turn it off at least once every time I shave. I have used norelco razors for many years and always get a good shave.</li>
    <li> Razor works well.  No complaints.  Purchased Norelco as that is all I have eer used.  (This is five more workds.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco for over fifty years, they all had a slide switch so I had a hell of a time trying to slide this switch to ON.  After a few days I discovered it was a pushbutton,  nice one Norelco.  It replaces a 5810XL which has served me well.&lt;br /&gt;  Just two suggestions, cover the sides with a non-slip rubber as the switch side has and put a coiled charging coil on it.</li>
    <li> This is my first to use PT730, it is worth the money for this product. I highly recommend it. I rate it 4 Star.</li>
    <li> Looks right for the money, and does the job. Light and easy to use. Don&#x27;t thin the more expensive ones worth it, but didn&#x27;t actually try the more expensive options.</li>
    <li> Works great.  The shave is comfortable. Nice to be able to rinse with water and use with or without cord.</li>
    <li> My first electric in over 50 yrs. of shaving! No more hassle and expensive blades!&lt;br /&gt;Will never buy another blade. Takes me about 5 min. to shave now.</li>
    <li> I had used my Norelco electric shaver for over 20 years before it finally gave out.  I was very happy with it, so I decided to purchase another Norelco and liked the price for the PT730.  I started using it about a month ago, and am very pleased with it.  It is light, quiet, and gives me a comfortable and close shave.  I have an average beard and even with a two day&#x27;s growth, this shaver has no trouble cutting the beard.  The only thing I can&#x27;t rate effectively is the shaver&#x27;s long term durability.  I don&#x27;t know if it will still be operating as well 5 years from now.  Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> It shaves close with no razor burn. It&#x27;s really easy to clean--just rinse out with water &amp; let dry per the directions. It lasts for a week of shavings without need to recharge. It is far superior to my last Remington, which died after one year and only held a charge for 2 to 3 shaves. Absolutely zero complaints after 3 months of use.</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with the PT730 after one month. In doing research before purchasing the shaver, I took all  the posted reviews, both positive and negative,  with a grain of salt. A user&#x27;s impressions will be based on various factors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Type of beard: I consider my beard to be a solid medium to slightly heavy. I have stubble every day and if I don&#x27;t shave for 2 days, it starts to look grubby. I&#x27;ve had no problems getting a fairly close shave where the skin feels smooth when I run my hand on it afterwards. Daily shaving is my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Expectations: Rotary shavers do required more passes then foil shavers. I expect that I will have to make more passes than a foil shaver, or a high end rotary shaver. I use a mixture of shaving motions -- circular, sideways and vertical against the grain. This has worked well. I also use a fairly light touch so the shaver heads glide and don&#x27;t pinch the stubble.  While it is recommended by experienced users and Philips Norelco that the user shave exclusively with the shaver for 3-4 weeks to get the skin acclimated, I had no break-in period right from the start. This may be due in part to shaving every day, using a light touch and the variety of shaving motions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Quiet, slow speed: I don&#x27;t have any other shaver to compare this with; however, I go by results. The shaver doesn&#x27;t have a high revolution sound to it and is fairly quiet; however, the results on my daily stubble growth have been satisfactory. so when people complain about the slow speed and sound of the motor, I take that with a grain of salt. The shaver does get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4: On durability of shaver and cutters: I&#x27;ll have to wait a year before I determine how long the cutting heads last. I am though, cleaning them daily and lubricating/degreasing them once a week. I am doing a dry clean only without rinsing the heads under water. This does take a few minutes, to carefully remove the cutting heads and the cutters from the combs; however, I don&#x27;t spend any more time than I would with a normal razor where I  pre-wash my face and lather on shaving cream.  I expect that how long I can use the cutting heads will be dependent on the thickness of my beard, the design/manufacture of the cutters, and the care I take of the shaver. If I find the cutters getting dull within a year, then I my satisfaction level may change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Battery: I&#x27;m getting nearly 3 weeks of shaving before I need to charge the shaver. Again, I expect that this will decrease over time through battery wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other considerations in my purchase: I&#x27;m going to be living overseas. I wanted a shaver that could be used either cordless or with cord. Higher priced wet/dry shavers tend to run on battery only after charging and cannot be used with cord. I was also concerned about cost. Foil shavers seem to have higher blade and foil replacement costs, as do the cleaning system cartridges for high end models. Budget was a consideration. The approximate $25 cost for the replacement HQ8 cutters seems reasonable when compared with replacement costs for other shavers. It&#x27;s still, though an expense to consider down the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize that uses with extremely heavy beards may or may not find the PT730 acceptable. For me, the PT730 has more than fulfilled my expectations for a low to medium range shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s getting close to one year since my purchase and I want to comment on the status of the cutter blades. It is definitely taking longer to get a close shave, yet I feel no pinching when shaving. I still find it more convenient, even taking a longer time, to not have to wet and lather my face and using an old fashioned razor with the expensive replacement blades, despite this shaver not giving as close a shave as a razor. The results I get, though are still acceptable. The manufacturer&#x27;s advice to replace the blades yearly may be accurate. A few things to keep in mind, whichmay have affected the blades lasting this long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I always do a dry clean after shaving and do not run the shaver under water.&lt;br /&gt;2) I use the Norelco cleaning spray once a week.&lt;br /&gt;3) I put a few drops of oil on the cutter blades once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Second Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little over one year. Longer shaving times -- 5 minutes or so for a light growth of 1-2 days. Yet again, there is no pinching. I haven&#x27;t replaced the cutter blades, but may in a few months. I would still highly recommend this, one year later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been over two years and I just changed the cutter blades -- long overdue. Until I did, it took more than five minutes to shave. Under the chin with longer hairs was more difficult. I had to repeatedly go over the same area countless times. Still, though, no nicking. With the new cutter blades, it&#x27;s like new. Battery is still holding a charge.and do not run the shaver under water. 2) I use the Norelco cleaning spray once a week. 3) I put a few drops of oil on the cutter blades once a week.  -------------------------------------------- Second Update:  It&#x27;s a little over one year. Longer shaving times -- 5 minutes or so for a light growth of 1-2 days. Yet again, there is no pinching. I haven&#x27;t replaced the cutter blades, but may in a few months. I would still highly recommend this, one year later.    Third Update:  It&#x27;s been over two years and I just changed the cutter blades -- long overdue. Until I did, it took more than five minutes to shave. Under the chin with longer hairs was more difficult. I had to repeatedly go over the same area countless times. Still, though, no nicking. With the new cutter blades, it&#x27;s like new. Battery is still holding a charge.</li>
    <li> I got it less $ 40. its nice and has a  fit price. its a good band and good useful.  hope more deal.</li>
    <li> user-friendly, portable, cute, very cool and not noisy. the silver line is very special, too. shaves clean. Just love it.</li>
    <li> Purchased this with the extra replacement heads.  Works great.  The extra blades will be nice when these start to get dull.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a razor this quiet before.  At first, I thought the battery was faulty because it sounded like it was about out of charge; just barely working.  But it cuts fine and I like it.  It&#x27;s not a power workhorse that&#x27;s ready to plow through thick beard hair, but as a daily shaver it works great.  No irritation, either.  I like it.  Flip up head makes it easy to clean and the flip out trimmer is handy for shaping and sideburns.</li>
    <li> Works great. Battery life amazing - one happy camper! Ad more words. Aint got time for this B S. Take my time no more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through quite a few electric razors and this is the only one that has passed my test, hah! Works and works and works, I&#x27;ll update this next year (it&#x27;s been about 1.5 years so far) and we&#x27;ll see how it goes, hopefully still kickin&#x27;!</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco razor&#x27;s for years. This one does not disappoint. It does a very fast and efficient job. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I really like this razor. I shaves very close and is a breeze to clean. I recommend this razor for all men will a light beard.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for years and this is the best yet. The cutter head is fixed in place and makes little noise. Cutters do a great job for a reasonably close shave. Also the shape of the unit makes it easy and comfortable to hold.</li>
    <li> Prior experience with Norelco razors lead me to assume this one would also satisfy me and it has done so.</li>
    <li> i like being able to use it cordless.  it gives a smooth leg and underarm shave. it is much better than the old one it replaced.</li>
    <li> My intent for the purchase of an electric razor is to replace shaving my face and head with a straight razor. This electric razor does a good job shaving my head and a mediocre job face and neck. I attribute this to having different types of hair. I have straight and slightly thick hair on my head and thick and curly facial hair. I find shaving dry I only need to make 3 to 4 pass on my head and 2 to 3 with electric razor liquid. The resulting cut is the same. It almost a smooth shave, but you can feel a little stubble. At the end of the day, my head is pretty much velcro. I imagine if you have really thick hair, you may have problems getting it shaved with this. If I let my hair go for a few days, I have to make numerous passes and I can hear the motor struggling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my face and neck, I have to make numerous passes and there are always a few hairs that just don&#x27;t get picked up. Always been the case no matter which electric razors I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things to note, the head just warm up rather quickly and I find it affects the shaving. As other reviews mention, the motor does seem rather weak. This razor is best for maintaining a clean shave everyday, rather than shaving every other day or so. What works best for me is to keep it by my desk, and whenever I check my work email before heading out to work, I&#x27;ll shave my head and face. Even if I miss a spot or two, it is not really noticeable and I&#x27;ll get it when I get home or make a note to make a pass in the morning. Works for me! A full charge lasts me about a week, but I use it significantly longer during shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is simple. Open the head, tap against the sink, and rinse with water. It comes with a brush for the hair that is just stuck. Easy process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For face shaving, I&#x27;d give it a 3/5.&lt;br /&gt;For head shaving, I&#x27;d give it a 4/5. (As long as you shave daily) I&#x27;m taking 1 point off because of the motor being easily strained and not being able to take thickerhair well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, if you purchase this to replace razor shaving, you&#x27;ll be disappointed if you care about shave quality. I stopped caring about having a silky smooth head and this is a happy middle ground for convenience and somewhat smooth. I fully expect to shave with my straight razor every now and then in the future, but in the meantime, this fits my bill and I&#x27;m happy with it as I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to do decently on facial hair.</li>
    <li> My job requires I stay clean shaven and this little baby does the job its meant to. The back pop up part doesnt work all that great but I ordered it not even knowing it had one so it was an extra that I didn&#x27;t need. The main unit however shaves pretty well!</li>
    <li> I had to replace my old Norelco because after 10 years the battery wouldn&#x27;t charge so I decided after reading  the reviews to try this model.  The new razor charged per instructions and it gives the closest shave I&#x27;ve every had using an electric.  It is easy to clean and works great.  I believe it will go for a couple of weeks on a charged so the charging schedule has not be inconvenient.</li>
    <li> I purchased this electric razor for my husband.  It works great, has a nice design that&#x27;s comfortable in his hand and it shaves comfortably and well.  It&#x27;s easy to clean and holds it&#x27;s charge well.</li>
    <li> took an hour to shave it just doesn&#x27;t do the job. Decided to just let my beard grow out now</li>
    <li> disappointment that I came damaged I can not positively qualify a defective product that remoteness issues I could not return to amazon</li>
    <li> very good product, happy with the results, good shave, easy to use and holds a charge good, i will shop here in the future</li>
    <li> Ordered this razor before...worked for about 45 days and then went dead.  Would not work plugged in or on battery.  Got this replacement razor and is working so good so far.  Cuts well and is very quiet.  Easy to clean and has stayed charged really well.</li>
    <li> Fantatic for the price</li>
    <li> I needed a new razor and had always had luck with Norelco. My experience with this razor has solidified this.  Nice, smooth shave. Easy to clean.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I was using a Norelco Spectra that I lost the head piece for.  Rather than buy the parts to repair it, I went with the 730.  Chose the 730 over the 724 because it supposedly has a higher end shaving system and a longer life battery.  You can also clean the 730 by rinsing it under a faucet which is a nice convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 730 gives a pretty close shave.  It is not nearly as smooth as the old Spectra and the motor does not seem as strong.  There are some other features that the Spectra had such as displaying the number of minutes remaining for battery life and settings for different face sensitivity that I miss.  The side burn trimmer works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not a bad shaver for the price, but if you can afford it, I would go with a higher end razor.</li>
    <li> This razor cuts pretty clean on my cheeks, and chin.  However it does not do a good job on the neck.  To be fair my neck hair grows in all different directions.  The razor is still more effective in close shaves, but for a quick and dirty job this works.  The shape also makes it difficult to get under the nose.</li>
    <li> I moved from an expensive Braun razor with an even more expensive cleaning system. This razor cleans with a warm water rinse and gives a close, comfortabl shave. It requires an overnight charge every two weeks.</li>
    <li> I love this Phillips Norelco PT730 Powertouch Electric Razor because it has 3 blades and it runs with a rechargeable battery. The 3 blades that this electric razor has are washable. They are not very sharp and that&#x27;s why they don&#x27;t cut my skin.</li>
    <li> Purchased on Amazon. Great shaver, meet expectations.  Easy to maintain,  rinse under hot water to clean. Recommend this shaver for home and travel. A/C charger 100 -220v and no adapter needed.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice device.  Much slower motor speed than my previous Norelco (which is about 20 years old), but works much better, especially when I go a few days between shaves.</li>
    <li> I use it daily and love it. It shaves quite closely . Great to clean. Prior razor the cutters would fall out whenever I cleaned it</li>
    <li> He husband suffers from primary immune systems deficiency so he normally would get rash after shaving; but it didn&#x27;t seem happen after using this electric razor. It&#x27;s really easy to use and clean. I personally like the handle and my husband loves the whole thing.</li>
    <li> The price was reasonable and the razor works very well.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the product and the company to anyone that needs to shave!</li>
    <li> Works very well, holds charge for a long time and is very easy to clean without having to worry about it getting messed up.</li>
    <li> item is excellent..really does its job!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco razors for many years, and this latest one is by far the best!  Looking forward to a long relationship with a company that stands by it&#x27;s products</li>
    <li> My Dad loves this shaver!  It doesn&#x27;t require water, it provides a close shave, and best of all, he can use it while sitting in front of the TV without a mirror!!!  He&#x27;s 80 years old and hard to please but he&#x27;s a happy man with his new shaver!</li>
    <li> JUNK, CRAP, GARBAGE, WASTE.  This piece of crap has a weak motor and weak batteries.  It runs very slowly and takes much longer than other Norelco shaver I&#x27;ve owned.  It takes so long that the cutting heads become rather warm, indicating that a lot of energy is going into friction rather than into cutting hair.  I have an old Remington DA307 with a hole in the foil that works much better than this crappy chink made JUNK.</li>
    <li> In spite of stellar reviews, this razor did not hold up. It is now in pieces in a drawer and seems unfixable.</li>
    <li> I used a Norelco twice in the past.  They used to be a hassle to clean, and didn&#x27;t shave well unless you also used a beard setup lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PT730 cleans up completely in a few seconds under hot water and gives a much better shave than the old electrics, without having to use a setup lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also impressed with the recharge indicator, a light that stays off until you need a charge. It went on after about two weeks of daily use, so I recharged.  After about 8 hours the light went off.  This may sound trivial, but too many rechargeable products give highly ambiguous signals about when a battery needs a recharge and when it is finally charged.  Norelco has found the single simplest solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a terrific product.  The most hassle-free shave I&#x27;ve had in nearly 50 years of shaving.</li>
    <li> It is just average in its shaving ability but it was and is just about what I expected for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always shaved with a triple blade razor until, by necessity (surgery on my right hand), I needed to purchase an electric shaver.  I was pleasantly surprised with the results.....Shaving is a pleasure and very satisfactory........Nice product.</li>
    <li> It is good,It is very suitable for me.There is only one bad origin is not correct.but customer service gave me a good answer.Thanks</li>
    <li> For what I needed, very good quality for the price. No problems yet, seems to work very well. Did purchase extra cutters. Charger works well also.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting a shave as close as with a straight razor - I can&#x27;t believe it.  It&#x27;s much better than my prior decade old Norelco.  It&#x27;s also much quieter, and the battery lasts for about 2 weeks for my average daily use.  It is built sturdy and almost is like a facial message in the way the combs rotate and flex with facial contours.</li>
    <li> Long term Norelco user, just needed to replace last one that battery would not charge.  Much better razor!  Light and easy to use.</li>
    <li> My dad picked this shaver and so I ordered it for him.  His previous Norelco shaver lost its energetic spin after 6 years. He likes this model because it shaves well enough.  It is lightweight and holds a charge well too.  His only complaint is it sprays out the cut hairs too much for him.  Overall he thinks this shaver deserves 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to replace one I bought decades earlier. They certainly last a long time. The new one works better than the first one. If a bad thing could be said, it would be they too long.</li>
    <li> I replaced my old Norelco and I guess I expected more.  It shaves really close, but it&#x27;s just that it takes so many strokes over the same area which cause me to rate it just OK.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor because I was pleased with my four year old [[ASIN:B001AJ6YS2 Philips Norelco 7310 Men&#x27;s Shaving System]] and it was time for a new razor.  The PT730 shave isn&#x27;t nearly as close as my old Norelco.  It requires several passes to get a clean shave, and even then it isn&#x27;t as close as I would expect.  I went from having a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow with my old Norelco to feeling like I need another shave at lunchtime.</li>
    <li> It works pretty good . a close shave . not as good as a German shaver but, not bad and i like it</li>
    <li> So far so good.  A fairly close shave, although please note I don&#x27;t have a super heavy beard.  I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Just didn&#x27;t realize how bad my old shaver was. WOW!! This thing is awesome. About half the time to get through the stubble in the morning. Wife loves it!!!</li>
    <li> Ordered this for our son&#x27;s birthday, the side cutters stopped working in 3 days.  Since I ordered it in Mid Sept and his birthday was in Oct. they would not let us return it.  Would not order again.  Would go direct to Norelco.</li>
    <li> it“s good product ,I will bye it later good good good good good good good good good good good good good</li>
    <li> The Norelco razor up to now has performed very good only time will tell its durability.I recommend it.excellent gift for man..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Norelco products before and switched to a blade for 12 years. Thought I would like to try electric again. I think that the main reason I only gave this product a 4 star rating is because of the break-in period you have to go through to get your face and beard accustomed to the shaving. I get a great shave, but it requires a lot of going over and over the areas to get the great shave. Perhaps more break in will make it easier. Lets hope. Fact that they recommend getting a new set of blades every year at a cost of $22 is another thing I don&#x27;t remember about my old Norelco, that I never changed the blades for years. It still worked great.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband because he was complaining about his 10-year-old one!  He said it shaves easily and cleanly, and he didn&#x27;t realize how bad his old Norelco was until he got this new one!</li>
    <li> Good, reliable shaver. It does take several hours to recharge, as opposed to less than one hour for my previous Norelco. But that&#x27;s not a problem for me, since I can still use it while it&#x27;s corded and recharging.</li>
    <li> I usually do not use an electric shaver after trying several over the years,  because blade shavers work better for me. However, I decided to give this shaver a try, because the price was reasonable. It shaved me close the very first shave. It has a head that cuts in two directions, circular and ip and down. I couldn&#x27;t believe the closeness of the shave. I have been using it for a few weeks, and have no intention of going back to my Fusion ProGlide. I cannot recommend this shaver enough, and it is very affordable.  I would have never thought an electric shaver would work for me because I have a tough beard. But I have been proven wrong.</li>
    <li> it is easy to use. and works great. I do recommend it.  I&#x60;m going to shave right now. so bye :)</li>
    <li> This electric razor is perfect. It looks well made with a quality feel to it. It is very quiet and gives a really smooth close shave. The instruction booklet was perfect even though it is easy to figure out everything n your own. The operation, charging, use and cleaning are really easy. You just do not need anything beyond this great razor.</li>
    <li> I bouught the PT730 for myself for Christmas.  Having bought it in November, I had a chance to read the reviews before I bought it, and while waiting to open my \\&quot;present\\&quot;.  I have to admit that I mainly read the negative reviews, and was ready to not like this razor due to it&#x27;s speed.  After only two days of use, and I know that it&#x27;s early to have a complete opinion, I must say that I like this new razor.  First off, it&#x27;s replacing a 10 year old razor, so I think I was due getting a new one.  The first thing I noticed was how much quieter the PT730 was than my old electric-only razor.  I can actually hear the blades cutting my beard.  Several of the comments mentioned that the PT730 was \\&quot;slower\\&quot; than they preferred.  So far, I&#x27;m OK with it&#x27;s speed.  Of course, it&#x27;s brand new with brand new blades, so I&#x27;ll have to hold judgement on its speed to see if there&#x27;s a problem later on down the line as the blades start to lose their edge.  For the price, I&#x27;m happy - so far.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for a Braun shaver which has the rectangular cutting surface. I was never able to get a close shave with the Braun. With the Phillips I immediately got a close shave without having to rub the area over and over. It&#x27;s an outstandng shaver. It&#x27;s light and easy to hold as well.</li>
    <li> This shaver seems to work very well.  I charge it about once a week but don&#x27;t know when it might run out of power.  It gives a close and comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> A little expensive, I like it can be washed all the body!&lt;br /&gt;A little expensive, I like it can be washed all the body!</li>
    <li> I bought it as a new year gift for my boyfriend. He said it works very smooth and safe, also the back of it works for hair, too</li>
    <li> I would recommend this as a great product at a terrific price.  My son was very pleased with the convenience and smooth shave of this razor.</li>
    <li> As a former blade man, I did not believe I could get a shave this close. It took a few days to win me over but I will never use a blade again. I also like that it can be rinsed out under running water. Best shave ever.</li>
    <li> Some times it shut down when I am shaving.  T start I have to press button many time like equipment not working</li>
    <li> Came fast. Works great.</li>
    <li> If it cut facial hair worth a **** I would of given it 5 stars but it&#x27;s really subpar performance merits 2 stars max. Not sure I want to spend money for replacement blades that equal half the cost of the razor and then still wind up with a razor that never gave a good shave to begin with. Nothing at all like my old Remington delivered for a good shave. Wish this would break so I had enough incentive to spring for something else.</li>
    <li> Not good... Not bad.  I think what shocked me was how long it takes to actually use this device.  A simple razor is much quicker</li>
    <li> This razor works very well and does everything I expected.  I recommend it for anyone who wants an electric razor.</li>
    <li> works fine as replacement for an older model</li>
    <li> It arrived quickly. Merchandise was not defective but material is very thin and all the edges/hems are serger-finished. Since it is to be used as a beach cover-up I will keep it but can&#x27;t really recommend it.</li>
    <li> Based on reviews I purchased a PT730 to replace a Braun that bounced off tile floor and did not survive.&lt;br /&gt;I guess we are not comparing apples to apples but the Norelco is a piece of crap. Spend the extra for a Braun  and get quality.</li>
    <li> i chose four stars for the phillops razer because it does a good job. my husband likes it very much. i would recommend it to anyone buying a new razor.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues so far and the battery lasts like 2 weeks and charges quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Love the ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;Would be nice to have a travel bag/holder for it, but I have an old one I will use.</li>
    <li> Razor is quiet and shaves very well.  However, the trimmer design is lacking - the angle isn&#x27;t convenient.  Prior versions were better for the trimmer.</li>
    <li> Holds its charge and give a good clean shave. Much better than my previous rechargable electric  which shall remain nameless.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric razor.  I find this works well on my cheeks, chin, and lip.  My neck is another story...I have to make multiple passes to trim down the hair.</li>
    <li> I am a lady and use this on my legs.  I started with another Norelco many years ago (borrowed from my husband) and the blades just needed replacing (but buying a new one was almost a better deal than buying replacement blades!).  Women&#x27;s electric razors do not work at all on my hair.  These Norelcos work pretty good, but I have to go over the area 2-3 times.  It is not just a quick up and down shave.  They do shave very closely though, for me they give as good of results as a disposable razor.  I would recommend for men and women any Norelco.</li>
    <li> These razors always work great and last for years. My husband loves this one! Easy to hold and use. ,!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Philips shaver for 6 years and it&#x27;s the best product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit I only gave this razor about one week but I could not tolerate the ingrown hairs this process gave me. In addition, the shave was never close and by mid-day, I felt I needed another shave. It&#x27;s back to Gillette blades and shaving cream for me and I&#x27;m already glad I went back.</li>
    <li> It takes more than twice as long to shave with this electric razor, versus a disposable straight razor.  I have to go over the same area multiple times to get all the hairs...and getting razor burn.  I tend to shave every few days, and this razor does not do well with longer whiskers.  Going to try some pre-shave lubricant to see if that helps.</li>
    <li> I have never been a fan of electric razors but thought I would give it another try. I have gone back to using my blade razor. I feel I get a closer shave in half the time.</li>
    <li> I used my old razor TOOOOO LOOONG!!  The newer technology is light-years better.  Don&#x27;t wait, you are needlessly punishing your face!</li>
    <li> bought this shaver 1 year now,still going. very nice shaver, when charged last good time before needs recharging.shaves smooth ...i need to change the heads now. but really good shaver.</li>
    <li> Best investment so far... don&#x27;t need to spend $$$ on razors..</li>
    <li> I have a shaved head as well as my face.  This razor takes on the wiry facial whiskers just as easily as the fuz on my neck. I had had an old Remington and couldn&#x27;t easily find new cutters for it.  This shaver has a special site one can go to get new cutters, when needed.</li>
    <li> Replacing a ten year old Braun, I was a bit hesitant with going with something half the price. After a month of use I find it to be extremely smooth and quiet. It feels good in the hand and is surprisingly light weight. So far I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> at my advanced age, shaving with a razor finally became too ##@!! bothersome. I didn&#x27;t see much other than Norelco when I looked for an electric, and this one was well priced. It sure beats the razor. Wish I&#x27;d have made the change decades ago, but I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve done it now.</li>
    <li> Far exceeded my expectations. Great shave with very little noise. Far and away the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had. Am totally happy with it!</li>
    <li> I buy it for my dad, since Father&#x27;s Day is coming. I think he would like it. To tell the truth, it feels good to hold and looks great, and the head is very flexible. Actually, it&#x27;s the second one I have bought for my father. As I find that he won&#x27;t buy it by himself, and i don&#x27;t know why. But I&#x27;m happy, because I get a chance to do something for my dad. Happy Father&#x27;s Day to all fathers.</li>
    <li> The rechargeable lithium battery is the best rechargeable I have ever seen on a razor - much better than a NiCd. And, you can actually wash it out with hot water.</li>
    <li> This shaver was very much appreciated when my husband received it for his birthday.  He is especially happy that it has the trimmer feature.  The Norelco name stands tried &amp; true.  It shaves closely and without burning his face.  It arrived ahead of the scheduled arrival date and was packaged very securely.</li>
    <li> Not the best razor I have ever owned</li>
    <li> Very happy with product</li>
    <li> My husband ordered this product about a month ago and he loves it.  Now skipping the every day razor shave in favor of this.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband.  He says it is lightweight and ergonomically shaped well so that it is easy to hold and use.  The shave leaves his face looking nice and shiney and feeling as smooth as silk. A great product.</li>
    <li> My brother marked this on his wish list.  They had it for a get price and accepted a manufacturer&#x27;s coupon.</li>
    <li> I owned an even cheaper Norelco (7310XL) for years that did a great job, but this new one just doesn&#x27;t cut it. It does an okay job, but I find it hard to get it to cut as closely as the previous model I owned.</li>
    <li> Great razor, easy to use. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought several for my friends in China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it turns out that chargers do not work at all. Not like many people might think, it&#x27;s not because that 220V standard voltage in China(compared to 110V in USA). Actually, the problem is that charger and shaver itself doesn&#x27;t match: shaver demands input voltage as 15V but charger provides only 8V. That means they cannot even be charged in the states! After I replace it with a charger with the correct output voltage, it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s even worse is the fact that I bought them(9) in 4 times around November. More people might be affected due to this problem. I&#x27;m so upset about this.</li>
    <li> The time it took to ship, was very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is solid.&lt;br /&gt;The shave is close and clean.&lt;br /&gt;The price is very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;The cordless capability is convenient.&lt;br /&gt;The ability to wash the blades is great.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my brother before he went to college. It doesn&#x27;t give a close shave but it&#x27;s good to have if you don&#x27;t have enough time to shave properly. He grows facial hair REALLY fast and needs to shave every day. So he uses it a couple of times a week because it&#x27;s quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s dry use only and you might need some lotion after using it.</li>
    <li> I have always used a Norelco brand razor and found them to be excellent for the intended purpose.  This one measures up to that expectation.  Close shave, gentle on the skin and efficient to use.  My last Norelco lasted ten years before the battery became weak.  I expect to get the same from this one.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this razor very much and it only takes him a few minutes to shave. Since it has a long cord that plugs into the wall he uses it plugged in.</li>
    <li> Hubbie tells me that he likes this electric razor very much...not as close as a blade, but &amp;#34;it does the job!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light weight and the heads can be rinsed clean are both great features to him.  Because we&#x27;re now&lt;br /&gt;seniors, this is a much safer shaving situation in comparison to a razor blade.</li>
    <li> been using this brand for over 2 decades and I do believe this one works better than the top of line 7 series I spent twice as much on.  seems to hold a charge longer than the previous razors as well.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t give the close shave I expected. Not much improvement over my previous Norelco. I have been using Norelco&lt;br /&gt;Shavers  practically my entire life, andI am a senior . I find I have to press harder and go over areas of my face more often.</li>
    <li> As advertised.  Only charge it once a week, and then it is very quick</li>
    <li> This razor will not shave all the hairs on my face. As another reviewer mentioned, it leaves about 3% behind, especially on the neck area. I have been hoping it would get better over time, but is has not. I even tried letting my face hair grow for more or less time hoping there was sweet spot in hair length for being able to use this razor, but after using it for roughly six months I am really bummed I did not return it right away, or at least in time for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When trying to get the last remaining hairs I eventually rash my skin, then give up and finally grab my old dull blade Norelco 5825XL to get the ones that this razor will not. The PT730 will just NOT do the job. I really hate this razor and would not recommend it to anyone coming from an older high quality Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy day though: I just just discovered that the HQ56 replacement blades will work on my old Norelco 5825XL razor! Now if I could just figure out what the PT730 razor is good for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Botton line: This razor is a major step down in quality from my old Norelco 5825XL and I just cannot recommend it. Truly disappointed.</li>
    <li> Not as good as a blade, but, if you use it every day it&#x27;ll keep the weeds down.  When I really need to have a good clean shave I&#x27;ll do a quick blade runner after using this - I just got tired of paying ridiculous prices to Gillette for something that ended up in the garbage all the time.</li>
    <li> Perfect electric shaver for the price, quick and quiet, shaves smooth and close without any irritation or cuts. Shaves almost as close as a blade but not quite, just right for me. Have been using blades for years on both my head and face, this shaver hits all the problem areas well that the blade didn&#x27;t. Just rinsing it clean with water after each use is a great feature and cost saver too.</li>
    <li> Makes you wonder why you didn&#x27;t make the purchase long before now.&lt;br /&gt;Extremely handy&lt;br /&gt;Makes a smooth haircut on legs and under arms&lt;br /&gt;Great product</li>
    <li> Norelco - you can&#x27;t go wrong - I have owned three of these basic models for the last 25 years.</li>
    <li> the razor is fine I wish they would have provided a carrying case . The other Norelco I had did.</li>
    <li> its not a very good product and l would not recommend this electric razor to anyone it leaves stubble after every shave</li>
    <li> this is a most handy and convenient shaver, it can be used anywhere in the house and does an excellent job of removing facial hair.</li>
    <li> shaver works well, maybe not quite as close a shave as my old Norelco with an adjustable shaving head but battery life is outstanding. I shave every day and my first charge lasted just over 5 weeks - I was so surprised.</li>
    <li> The blades stopped rotating in less than 3 months. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been pleased thus far.  I have owned Norelco for a while and needed a new one for the road.  Good cut for beard and has a nice trimmer.</li>
    <li> Had this shaver for several months and I like its durability and close shave.  Not the strongest motor but enough for my beard.</li>
    <li> Bought this when I saw it was on special (and had a coupon!) to replace my nearly 5-year-old Norelco that had a battery that would barely last a day.  For the price paid, I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting as drastic of an improvement as this thing delivers.  I get a far closer shave AND the battery lasts a solid week without charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer also works extremely well -- I have a goatee and try and trim it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality seems very good overall.  I WILL be recommending this shaver to friends and family.  It truly is a fantastic value.</li>
    <li> I have given it the requested three weeks to get used to the cut since my previous razors were Remington and Braun. I like the feel of the razor and the finished result but the blades are still cutting into my neck skin so I have to be very careful. I am hoping this eventually gets resolved but in the meantime I am happy with the purchase. I especially like the long battery life between charges and the warning of a low battery so I am not suddenly left half-shaven and without power. The trimmer works well.&lt;br /&gt;Update: After a few months the razor is not cutting my skin but I have to be careful around the neck skin where it is looser than on my face.</li>
    <li> good charge hold time, works well.  Not disappointed</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever had. It is my 2nd Philips Norelco. After my first Norelco finally died after 10 years I purchased a Remington &amp;#34;black diamond&amp;#34; (I think it was) just to see if it was better and I had to take it back. Then I saw this PT730 and I ordered it based on the reviews and it is excellent. I have been using it for a year now and I&#x27;ve had no problems. Nothing but good things to say and will never stray from Philips Norelco ever again!</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco razors for a long time. This little razor will give you a good clean shave. Save your money and get this one. Do you really need all the other option&#x27;s the other ones have</li>
    <li> It quit working after a week of use !!! Do NOT Purchase One !!! It must have been a REALLY OLD MODEL !! No more Norelco for me !</li>
    <li> By now, it hasn&#x27;t meet my expectations. Shaving is not perfect. I can&#x27;t get a close shaving as I expected</li>
    <li> would have liked better if came with charger.otherwise very good. wil probably purchase charger at latter date in the yr.</li>
    <li> PRICE WAS RIGHT AND OPERATION WAS FLAWLESS !  MET MY EXPECTATION IS EASE OF OPERATION AND FLIP OPEN COVER MAKES CLEANING A BREEZE.</li>
    <li> I use the Phillips Norelco 7810XL electric razor which is an excellent model.  When a teenage son started shaving occasionally I would find my razor in his bathroom.  I decided to purchase an electric razor for him.  Unfortunately the 7810XL model is no longer made however I found that the PT730 is an approximate replacement for the 7810XL.  Both razors have a unique rotary screen design that makes them very effective razors.  My son is very pleased with the purchase.  The case on the newer model seems a bit more plastic that the old razor but should hold up well.</li>
    <li> This razor net all my expectations. I especially liked the ease of cleaning.  It gives me a close and comfortable shave</li>
    <li> Yes, a good razor cost $80-$100. Don&#x27;t be a cheap person and settle for the $40 Remington. There is a reason its half the price.&lt;br /&gt;Being cheap will always cost you more.</li>
    <li> I like everything about the razor except the on/off switch.  It takes a little getting used to.  Maybe I&#x27;m just more familiar with the switch on my old norelco.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent shaver and worth the price tag.  I use it almost every workday, and it isn&#x27;t quite as clean as a razor, but it does an overall good job.  Sometimes it has problems with longer hairs if I haven&#x27;t shaved for a day or two, but otherwise it works pretty well.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> it works very well. waterproof makes it easier to clean, and it is rechargeable. i don&#x27;t have to bother changing batteries. love it!</li>
    <li> I ordered philips Nerelo treamer and its really work for me..and I am really happy with it. I already recomended few of my friends to use it......I just loved it.....</li>
    <li> Got it today and used it already. It didn&#x27;t come with any charge, but it does work with the cord. I was impressed with the shave. Lighter than I imagined, which is a good thing.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas and ordered it early December.  He charged it December 28th overnight and it shaved very well and he loved it.  It lasted about a week and he charged it again and it lasted a couple of days and this has been the case in January.  He plugged it in February 1st and it was dead.  He charged it again and same thing.  The 45 day warranty is no good even though he only has had it for 39 days because he got it Christmas day.  I contacted Amazon Customer Service and they are sending out a new shaver and I&#x27;m returning the one that won&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope the new one will last much longer as my husband did like the shaver when it worked.  WORKS VERY WELL.</li>
    <li> Very quick and close shave.  Gentle and smooth with no pulling.  Trims mustache and sideburns very easily.  Big improvement from my previous Remington.</li>
    <li> These barely cut beard, still noticeable hair when shaving area over and over, and its not like my beard is really thick, this really is not for those with curly hair, even worst this gave me razor bumps</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Philips Norelco shavers consistently for almost 40 years.&lt;br /&gt;Bought the PT730 recently to replace a Norelco shaver I bought in Saudi Arabia in 1996.&lt;br /&gt;This model gives great close results, the trimmer works fine and I really like the ability to clean it with running water.</li>
    <li> this thing has worked well and proven itself, it has survived 2 missions out here in Afganistan! 1 charge and it was good for 9 days, and that was with sharing it with at least 3 other Marines each day and once we got back, it still was good. it had sand and dirt all over it and it would work like a charm. i am very happy with this razor. the only thing i can notice wrong with it is that the razor does not like to cut hair on the neck and under the jaw line. it will, but you have to move it in a bunch of different directions. this thing is awesome, and i hope it last me a long time. the Philips Norelco line has made me a customer for life of there razors.</li>
    <li> not a very close shave for a heavy beard like mine but does the job adequately. good hold of the charge and ergonomic. good buy</li>
    <li> Bought this after watching tons of other reviews about this product. Many raved and many cried, I gave it a shot and was unimpressed. It took more then 3-5 times on average of going over the same spots over and over again to get my face smooth when a quick swipe of the razor would have done it in two minutes. Disappointed but too lazy to repackage it up and send it back. Also you can&#x27;t use it while plugged in. It likes shaving gel, but doesn&#x27;t work at all with shaving cream. Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t get this. I tried it for 2 weeks and just gave up and went back to my razor.</li>
    <li> Norelco known for its quality and my husband has been a continuous&lt;br /&gt;customer.  He states it is easy to operate, smooth shave and would&lt;br /&gt;not be without it.</li>
    <li> hey, the PT730 Powertouch Razor does the job. 4 stars for a once-a-day-mowing.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Gives me a good shave. Have had it for about a year.</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband, and he loves it.</li>
    <li> POS will not cut much. Have to shave with a blade then use this to finish because this just doesn&#x27;t cut.</li>
    <li> The razor did not get as close a shave as expected.</li>
    <li> It was nice and quiet.  It was a gift and my husband liked it.</li>
    <li> A gift to my husband.  He seems to like the shave.</li>
    <li> i wish i had kept my receipt.  this razor does not give a good shave a all; i am very disappointed with it.  i do not complain much but as a good customer of amazon i must on this item...&lt;br /&gt;thanks  Dan</li>
    <li> This does not cut the hair well at all. It ripped out some hairs and didn&#x27;t touch others. I tried it for a few weeks hoping it would get better. NO SUCH LUCK! I am much happier with my $15 travel razor.</li>
    <li> have used Norelco for over 25 yrs.this is good razor.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco&#x27;s for years and compared to my previous model this one is quieter, runs longer on a charge and gives a closer shave.</li>
    <li> Great razor. Cuts very close!</li>
    <li> Great product, nice shave, and easily cleanable. good battery life.</li>
    <li> Way to slow, it takes forever to get a complete shave on since you have to go back and forth a lot to get all spots of hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Nice razor for the money.</li>
    <li> Family members love this product. Works great</li>
    <li> I got this as my third Norelco to replace the last one.  It&#x27;s pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; - the battery lasts forever.  I charged it once I can&#x27;t remember how many days ago and it just keeps working.&lt;br /&gt; - it will run on a chord (my old one had the batteries die.  I replaced them myself with a soldering iron, but they didn&#x27;t last long either  - then I used the chord only for many years).&lt;br /&gt; - it shaves pretty good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;  - I also shave with a 5-blade razor (when I shave my head), and sorry, this just isn&#x27;t as close.  But it&#x27;s at least as close as my old one.  If you hold your skin tight with one hand and do circles with this razor, it&#x27;s pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;  - the combination of holes and slots is a bit gimicky to me.  My old one had just slots and I think it was a little better at shaving after going about two days.  If I have long stubble, it takes some effort to get them.&lt;br /&gt;  - when I use it on my lower neck, I get irritation.  That&#x27;s probably the same as my old one, but technology hasn&#x27;t made that any better.  If you shave areas like that more often, I think they build up a tolerance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is acceptable - works but nothing real exciting (a little awkward for my ears...)</li>
    <li> Had one for around 30 years.  Never changed the head.  And it was still holding a charge for quite awhile.  Decided it was time for&lt;br /&gt;a new one.  The closeness of the shave was outstanding and quick too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim Wheatley</li>
    <li> Working grat and met my expectations from my old razor.</li>
    <li> Compared to my older Norelco,this razor runs more slowly and requires repeated movement over the same area to get a reason reduction in the stubble.  It needs to make faster revolutions of the spin heads within the head to cut the stubble.</li>
    <li> Works great and is easy to use</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and recharge. It seems to hold a charge for several days and cuts close and very comfortable.</li>
    <li> very good one. I can&#x27;t compare with others but this one is good for use. Just hope the price can be reduced further.</li>
    <li> I have used this razor for about 3 weeks now and it has worked great for me.  I actually bought one for my father first and I was impressed enough to buy a 2nd one for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an average or better beard and I have always used electric razors.  In the past, I tended to buy the low-end Norelco for about $25-30 and just replace them instead of buying new blades.  They worked OK for a while but the battery life was never very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shaved about 12 times and I am still on the 1st charge with this razor.  It is working well for me even if I wait 3 or 4 days between shaves.  It is much quieter than my previous razors and I like the reduced charge time (8 vs 16 hours).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For about $50, this is a good deal.  I was looking at about $25 to replace the blades in my old razor.  It is a big step up from the low-end versions I used in the past and worth the extra $25 for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quiet&lt;br /&gt;Can skip a few days between shaves without problems&lt;br /&gt;Holding a charge well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None so far&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 5/3/2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this razor for over 5 weeks now (3 to 4 times per week) and I am still on the first charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 7/31/2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still like this razor.  I finally had to recharge it at the end of May 2014.  The initial charge lasted about 9 weeks when used 3 times a week, so about 27 quick shaves ( &lt; 3 minute per shave).</li>
    <li> My husband couldn&#x27;t believe how great this razor worked. Got it to replace his old Norelco and there is a world of difference. He loves it.</li>
    <li> I am switching from using a Hair Clipper, because I&#x27;m now shaving once a week instead of monthly.  So maybe I&#x27;m not a good judge.  I used to shave daily with a normal razor and cream.  This takes a few passes to get it all, but afterwards I like the results.  Really close and comfortable unless I let the whiskers grow too long</li>
    <li> Good quality and lightweight. Nice quiet motor. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> The razor is Good, not great. I had an earlier model similar to this, which was a step down in features and price. I don&#x27;t notice a big difference between the two.</li>
    <li> Very good shaver.  The battery lasts for a long time.</li>
    <li> Old man who gets a great shave.  I&#x27;ve used the razor for years,  progressing from heavy dark growth to heavy grey.  It doesn&#x27;t care about the change in hair color!</li>
    <li> shaver works well. blades were sharp. Smaller than an older Norelco that I was using that was about  5 years old.</li>
    <li> Ease of use. Fits hand and allows easy movement. So as an 88 yr. Old f..t  cannot be beat. Need on e more word, so here it is  wow!</li>
    <li> Finally broke down and bought a new electric razor after using a Norelco 3405LC for about twenty years and is falling apart.  Instructions say be careful to keep blades and holders matched up for the best results.  Problem is, they never told me that the blade assembly will detach from the body of the razor and spill the blades and holders all over the floor.  The assembly will plug back into the body without issue, but this would have been nice to know.  Other than that, this has been a pretty good unit.  It shaves a lot better than my old one and will recharge in less than an hour.  Easier to clean being able to pass it under running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE(12/23/2013) Shaver is advertised to work using the cord or cordless.  Cordless works fine.  If I try to use the cord, it keeps falling out as it does not fit snugly into the plug.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this razor.  Had an earlier version that was probably 25-30 years old which I liked just fine, but this one is far quieter with a closer shave that I don&#x27;t feel at all.  I thought I&#x27;d need a couple days to \\&quot;break-in\\&quot; my skin as I had to with each set of new blades for the old one, but did not.  Only thing I don&#x27;t like us the trimmer is at about a 90 degree angle which makes it hard to trim hair on the back of my wife&#x27;s neck</li>
    <li> I have always used Norelco elec. razors ,this one they have improved further on.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s to say? I have been using this brand of razor for 50 years. I do know that it is far more cost effective to buy a new razor versus buying replacement heads ($25+). Great razor, great price here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> First the shaver works great.  It shaves better than my old Norelco which took 14 years to die.  The only thing that was wrong is that the charging cord seemed to be the wrong cord.  It would not charge my shaver.  I called customer service and they sent a new charging cord.  When the cord arrived it was different than the one in the original package,  The new cord works fine and everything is A-OK.  It was just inconvenient to have to call customer service and get a new cord sent.  It should not have to be that way</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not much of an electric razor person. However I&#x27;m tired of paying for over priced blades. I recently had shoulder surgery and needed an electric razor. After some research I found this Norelco. It&#x27;s been a great razor with a closer shave than expected. I have sensitive skin that usually gets irritated with electic razors. This doesn&#x27;t bother my skin and it&#x27;s easily rinsed out under the sink. I&#x27;d buy one again.</li>
    <li> Just what he needed!  I bought this shaver for my husband.  He is super happy with it and says its the best shaver he&#x27;s ever had!  It gives him a close shave and the flip out trimmer is good for touching up the bits he missed.</li>
    <li> working perfectly for two years plus!</li>
    <li> very good for sensitive skin,wonderful! My husband uses it every day.I will recommend to my friend, price is quite reasonable.</li>
    <li> This razor for some reason  works better that the  Norelco sensotouch that I replaced it with, less money better shave ?  Amazon didn&#x27;t send me the extra head that I bought as a package that&#x27;s my one complaint.</li>
    <li> I wanted something for home and travel and this fit the bill plus being simple and easy to clean. I find it does a good job with shaving for a close finish. The only drawback for me is the head is a little large and extends beyond the blades in a somewhat awkward way but it has not actually been a problem with shaving. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> good, I like it! It works very well, and no any problems has been found. The price is OK for this item!</li>
    <li> Seems to be working out fairly well. More difficult to clean than my old Remington though.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t anything amazing, unlike what some have said. It doesn&#x27;t offer any closer shave than any other electric I&#x27;ve used and it is not as close as a straight razor. However it does work well enough for its price. I have to do about 4-6 passes on one spot to get all the hair evenly shaved, which is similar to my previous electrics when they were new. No flaws, but nothing special.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned various brands of electric razors over the years and I must say that PT730 is the best razor I have ever used. It certainly shaves as close as a blade and I don&#x27;t get razor burn like I did from my previous electric razors. You won&#x27;t be sorry if you purchase this razor. Great job Philips Norelco</li>
    <li> There is really nothing special about this razor. Its wireless and charges. Does a fair job getting close but no where near a close a straight razor. I think I like my old Braun better.</li>
    <li> Light weight. Holds a long duration charge. Closeness of shave is OK, but not outstanding (Probably related to the total lack of irritation of my skin).  Price is right.</li>
    <li> I shave with it but I still end up using a bic razor to get a better shave.. are the blades as sharp as they should be?</li>
    <li> Very good deos what it said it will holds charge for days.</li>
    <li> Good as ever, but getting a little pricey.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco electric razors since I started shaving almost 45 years ago.  I have tried other brands 2 times, and went back to Norelco for many reasons... smooth shave, quality of the products, etc.</li>
    <li> When the battery in my Remington started to require more frequent charging and it was time to replace the shaving head, I thought I&#x27;d give the Philips version of my razor a try. Now, I&#x27;m getting a better shave for a little bit more than the price of replacing the head in my old Remington.</li>
    <li> Good shaver for the price</li>
    <li> I purchased this Norelco after my other Norelco stopped working.  I have been extremely dissatisfied with this razor because it does not provide a smooth shave.  Much of the stubble remains after numerous attempts to remove them with this razor.  I have owned several Norelco razors over the years and they all have stopped working within one to two years.  I&#x27;m not sure at this point if I will purchase another Norelco razor. Please note that my wife ordered this item for me but the comments are mine.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend seems to really like this razor, especially the little pop up trimmer. Seems to be working fine still.</li>
    <li> Sure, its nice enough to get most of the job done, say 97%. The problem is the remaining 3%, I can go over those missed hairs over and over again, and they just don&#x27;t cut.</li>
    <li> Your razor is great as was the old one.  Quality and perfromance better - good improvement&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did not compare with other makes do to the results I had with my Old Norelco.</li>
    <li> Best razor I&amp;#34;ve ever had. Hardly have to shave the next day after using it.</li>
    <li> Have been using this razor for a couple of months and now just charging it for second time.  I like the feel of it in my smaller hands and the fact that it is washable.  Only thing that surprised me was how quiet the heads are.  At times I wonder if they rotate as fast as my older Norelco.  But since I get a close shave with no &#x27;pulling of whiskers&#x27; I assume heads are working just the way they are designed too.  Definitely a great buy for the money.</li>
    <li> Motor seems much slower and weaker than my previous Norelco. I also noticed it is made in China and the old ones were from the Netherlands, I believe. But it seems to get the job done so we will have to see how it lasts.</li>
    <li> It does a good job. Fast charging. It&#x27;s lightweight but feels durable. I would recommend this product for light to medium shaving.</li>
    <li> Holds a charge forever. Smooth on skin and has huge catch basin for hair so you don&#x27;t have to empty it all the time. love it.</li>
    <li> this razor is just fine! it leave a great shave, and the moustage trigger is very nice too, overall a great product for a low price, thank you , very pleased</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the perfect shaver, you found it in the PT730!!I recently purchased the PT730 and must say that it is the very best shaver in every way. I&#x27;m going on my fifth shave now and the battery still appears to be fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this shaver!!</li>
    <li> Reasonable price, handles nicely, does the job. The Norelco shaver is a decent shaver. Had them for years and will continue</li>
    <li> Does not shave near as close as a razor, but I expected that. Does a pretty good job for a low cost shaver. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned Norelco shavers for quite a few years and bought the PT730 after the last one quite. By the way, the last one&#x27;s trimmer fell apart after less than a year. I liked everything about the PT730 - the way it felt in my hand, the way it looked, a decent battery life, the trimmer - everything about it except that it simply would not cut down to the skin. I have to go over and over and over my skin until it is irritated, even to the point of being a bit raw. I hate to say it but it is the poorest shaving shaver I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> its norelco, so its good</li>
    <li> I have to use electric shavers, because my skin is so sensitive. I thought maybe a men&#x27;s razor would work best, because they seem to be made of higher quality materials and have replaceable parts. I tried shaving my legs with this and it just didn&#x27;t work. I was very disappointed. It didn&#x27;t perform as well as my $20 women&#x27;s electric shaver. The hair was barely cut.</li>
    <li> This is my hubby&#x27;s 2nd one. great product and great price.</li>
    <li> My Dad was a Norelco user and loved them, I never tried one till this one and I&#x27;m a believer shaves as close as any blades I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> After using a Remington rotary for years it was breath of fresh air to get this razor.&lt;br /&gt;Very Close, very quiet, No bells and whistles, just a solid performer. Water clean up is a plus</li>
    <li> Its okay. I haven&#x27;t been able to find a really good one that was middle priced in 10+ years. They just don&#x27;t make them like they used to.</li>
    <li> Seems good - not sure it gives as good a shave as my 10 year Norelco did.  Time will tell.</li>
    <li> First time usage with this type of razor was very successful as a gift, and no need for bad reviews or return.</li>
    <li> Big but light, just how I like my women.</li>
    <li> The Phillips Norelco PT730 is giving me smooth shaving, with no irritation!</li>
    <li> Father in law with dementia can use it easily!</li>
    <li> Good product with quality..</li>
    <li> I buy this shaver -- or its equivalent -- when the batteries get to the point where they&#x27;re only good for a couple of shaves (in my case, about every five years). Why not take it to a shop and have them solder in new batteries? Because every time I buy a new shaver, it&#x27;s a huge improvement over the one it&#x27;s replacing. I don&#x27;t really know why. This one is no exception. Quick, close shaves. Clipper thingy. Quiet. Easy cleanup.  That&#x27;s all I need and that&#x27;s what this shaver offers.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Replaced older model.  Although the same functions there are lots of quality improvements.  I expected a case and a base. But the quality is tips</li>
    <li> Good shave at a good price.  I know you can get better, closer shaves with other electric razors, but this does the job. Easy to clean and the price was reasonable.  I&#x27;ve had Norelco shavers for a long time and I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
    <li> Nice razor..my old one hadn&#x27;t been replaced in appx 12 years</li>
    <li> Easy to understand instructions, quiet operation; be careful if you have folds in your skin to avoid pinching.</li>
    <li> A basic and efficient electric razor. I replaced an older one with a few more features with this one. Electric razors never shave as close as blades but they don&#x27;t cut you, either. This one works well and I consider it a solid performer with no unnecessary frills. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Norelco Electric Razor for maybe five years (cost around $80) and never changed the razor, so I thought it was time to upgrade.  For whatever reason, I don&#x27;t get nearly as close a shave with this razor as I do with my 5-year old razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have particularly thick stubble, but I still have to go over areas several times.  Because of this, my skin is more chafed.  Later in the day, I find my stubble being more pronounced than it was with my old razor.  With my old razor, I could sometime skip a day of shaving, but not with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be the lowest-star review I have left on an Amazon product, but I just feel like it wasn&#x27;t worth my money.  It looks nice, but does not perform well.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to replace an old electric shaver that didn&#x27;t ever give me a shave as good as a razor - not even close. I never owned a Norelco and I&#x27;m so glad that I made this purchase. With my old shaver I had to press it hard against my skin to get a pretty close shave. With the Norelco it just glides over my skin and I can barely feel it, but it gives me a shave just as good as a razor. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m ever going to use a razor again as using this shaver is so much easier and faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you finish shaving all you have to do is open the top and rinse it with water, close the top and shake off the excess water, then reopen the top and let it air dry.</li>
    <li> Been using disposable razors for the last 15 years. 20 years before that I was using Remington electric foil shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have a sensitive beard,  and I couldn&#x27;t shave everyday with  the disposable razors.  So, I decided to try this Norelco rotary (PT730).  Gave it a thorough college try, and it was great to be able to shave every day again, but I started to realize that the Norelco was not shaving as close as blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seemed to recall the foil shavers doing better, so I found this Remington MSC-140:  [[ASIN:B0009OAFVG B0009OAFVG]]  Very inexpensive and shaves much closer.  I only wish it was rechargeable instead of using AA batteries.  Removing and recharging NiMH AAs, every few days or every week is somewhat of a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I missed my Amazon return deadline by one day.  Norelco has a 45-day, money-back guarantee trial period, but it seems like a hassle to jump through all of their hoops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, this rotary is quieter than the foil razors.</li>
    <li> Close, clean shave with no irritation.  I am very pleased with this electric shaver.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it because it gives a close shave and it holds a charge for a very long time.</li>
    <li> use it everyday and has worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> As of 12-27-13, the description on this item lists its origin as USA. The razor we received was NOT made in the USA or the Netherlands like one I ordered last year. As someone who tries not to buy Chinese garbage, I was not pleased. The one I received is not a P730 but a P730/XX listed on the back of the razor and made in China. It looks the same otherwise and seems to operate the same as the Dutch built one, but it will be hard to say how it will last. I am not really sure of the difference between the model numbers but Amazon needs to update the description to be accurate.</li>
    <li> I bought a much more expensive razor thinking that it would be great, but it was horrible.  I use the razor to shave my bald head so it get&#x27;s a pretty good workout.  This razor is Great at any price.  Much better than other much more expensive razors!</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this to any one. I have had serious difficulties with this razor leaving red sore spots all over my husband&#x27;s face. It does not give a good even shave leaving some whiskers longer than others. The lip area is never clean looking. I&#x27;m not a novice at shaving him either. I&#x27;ve been doing it for ten years. I wish I had not thrown his old one out. I think its too light weight to give a really even save. or maybe you just to have perfectly placed whiskers. What a waist of money. I read the reviews before I bought it too so I was informed and I&#x27;m glad those people are happy with it. Perhaps the problem lies in it simply not being a good razor for an older man if so I wish I had know that fact.</li>
    <li> It was easy and fast to get a close shave without having to to use excessive pressure. The big plus is that if I couldn&#x27;t shave one morning the next day it easily cut my beard, no hairs were ever painfully pulled out.  Easy to recommend this razor to everyone!</li>
    <li> It is the best electric razor that I have used. That is saying a lot since the last 3 electric razors that I have owned in the last 15 years have been Norelco.</li>
    <li> I bought this model to replace an aging AC only Norelco (this one will be the 4th Norelco I&#x27;ve used in the last 30 plus years) and it&#x27;s the best one to date. I wanted one with battery power and the LiIons in this one are great. I get a weeks use per charge. One reviewer sited an issue with the motor&#x27;s low RPM rate, but it hasn&#x27;t hindered it in my opinion. Finally, the hot water clean-up was the tipping point and I haven&#x27;t looked back since receiving it (with free shipping to boot). My only criticism (not enough to drop a star) is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a case like previous models have. Not a big problem at this point.</li>
    <li> Great product! Very comfortable when razing my beard. Also the razor very easy to clean. The battery life is also good, I use it everyday, and only have to charge it once a week</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for a shaver that got damaged. It is just what my husband wanted and meets all his needs.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for me for another Norelco electric that lasted me much more than five years. My beard adjusted after a few days and the razor is still doing a good job after six months .  It charges quickly, goes about two weeks between recharges, and gives a close shave if care is taken to spend enough time in the tough areas.  This has been a good value so far.</li>
    <li> good electric shaver.  I enjoy having the razor charged and ready to go.  I only have to recharge it every 7 to 8 days.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this razor has as much power as my previous Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s rather sluggish as far as I can tell.</li>
    <li> I tried several razors but this one seems to work the best for me. So far only had to charge it once in a weeks worth of shaving everyday.</li>
    <li> This razor initially surprised me by being so light compared to my previous Norelco razors but it packs a sufficient punch for it&#x27;s size. Well made and suitable enough for shaving my whiskers. But, it does not do a real good job of shaving close and I usually have to follow up by using a razor blade in the shower for a real close shave. Water proof so very easy to clean under tap water. The battery appears to me to be much better then previous Norelco razors I have used and last considerably longer between charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it can&#x27;t be beat. But, if one wants a closer shave every time, I would look at different model razors.</li>
    <li> Great electric razor. It does what it says to do. A great feature is that you can wash the head in the sink after use, so you don&#x27;t need to use those boring small brushes to clean it.</li>
    <li> at first I was a tad bit disappointed because the blade rotation is about 40% slower than my old Norelco purchased about 20 years ago. But after using this razor for about a year now I have no complaints  it works as it should, holds a charge a really long time and trims my scruffy beard just fine,</li>
    <li> Light weight yet powerful. Charges quick and lasts quite a while.</li>
    <li> This shaver works well compared to the foil screen Remington I had before.  I get a close shave although the rotary heads aren&#x27;t as convenient to clean as my foil head was.  Also, there was no travel case included, and the plastic head cover falls off quite often.  It&#x27;s a decent shaver, but after making shavers for several decades, you&#x27;d think Norelco would have these kinds of things worked out by now.</li>
    <li> Never really used an electric shaver - works better than I thought. I should have bought the waterproof model</li>
    <li> Works good i only charged  when i got it , just keeps going shave after shave, good Razor.</li>
    <li> The motor is weak and the blades do little to cut my facial hair. I&#x27;ve since replaced my heads on my trusty Remington from 1989 and am back to using it. The difference in construction, motor operation and usefulness are worlds apart&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this at all.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and as expected!  product works great and allows my teenage son to shave quickly without cuts.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I use it everyday</li>
    <li> Close shave with little effort.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews for this item before buyinhg for my husband&#x27;s birthday.  He loves it!!! Says it gives him a shave as close  as his blade. He wore out his previous Norelco, and says this is greatly improved.</li>
    <li> I got it on time and so far it works ok for the little I use it.  Triming mostly.</li>
    <li> It works well and it is very easy to clean. It takes a little longer to get a closer shave that my old shaver but it is much nicer and smoother on my face.</li>
    <li> Works great has a long charge.</li>
    <li> Terrible razor. Should be  labeled as a Facial Massage machine.&lt;br /&gt;You will need to spend 20 minutes to shave your face until you  get an&lt;br /&gt;Ok minus shave.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money or your time.</li>
    <li> Pretty good but after a year of use it doesn&#x27;t seem to be quiet as powerful as it once was, even with new blades. Does a good enough job for the price but if you can afford it, I&#x27;d spend a little more on a nicer one</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very light and it  keeps a good  charge for a long time. The shave is pretty good as well.</li>
    <li> If they still have it when my husbands and if my husbands finally wears his out.  He likes it a lot.</li>
    <li> I replaced a 6 year old Norelco with this one. No power issues, shaves well and the battery life is decent. Good, solid razor.</li>
    <li> Pros: Very practical, dynamic design; easy to hold and to control. When it cuts, it makes a peculiar sound which helps to know if/when that particular section is shaved. Blades adjusts well to the configuration of the face. Easy to clean, to wash.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Designers neglect an important feature. When turned on, the shaver should show how much charge remains, whether with vertical/horizontal levels or showing a number. There is no way to know when to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;SANVI</li>
    <li> I had an older version of this which I used for many years. I ordered this to replace it. It cuts closer and with minimal discomfort. Great buy.</li>
    <li> After seven months of using this razor, I finally gave up. It had been 40 years since I last used an electric razor, because I like a close shave. Well, everything about this model works fine except it won&#x27;t shave really close no matter how long I shave with it. I finally broke down and bought a Panasonic and what a difference. The Panasonic not only shaves extremely close, but is very fast. I can shave both my face and head in just a few minutes. Do your self a favor and skip this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several months, and I love it!  It warns me before it needs charged and gives a great shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had many of this style Norelco and this one seems the weakest - no oomph - no force..</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with a trusted brand like Norelco.  They have been around for years.  That&#x27;s why I bought 2 for my boys for Christmas.  No complaints.  Used everyday, does the job, easy clean up, good price and durable.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband who seems to go thru them fairly quickly...This razor does the job and now I hope it will last longer than his others...</li>
    <li> It works very well.  Charges fast and a single charge last for about 2 weeks for me.  Cut is close with no irritation.  Easy clean up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a Norelco electric razor for over 30 years.  I have a heavy beard and always found the product was convienent to use and delivered excellent results.  My last replacement was done using Amazon.  The process is painless, but you have to know the model number so that you order the correct Norelco product.  The flip out sideburn trimmer is a feature of the PT730 that I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new Razor must have state of the art battery technology.  I charged it the first time almost a month ago and have used it daily.  The low charge indicator has not come on yet.</li>
    <li> Runs slower, so takes longer to shave, but gives a good shave. This is to fill in my required word count.</li>
    <li> Replaced another Norelco that had been in service over ten years. This is lighter but just as powerful. Better than the competitors at a good shave with comfort.  It is lighter. I think it is the battery change mentioned in other reviews. The motor shows no change in power and the head and blades are interchangeable.</li>
    <li> Great for those shaving longer hairs. Product was shipped and worked just as it was advertised.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used shave razor and shave cream for more than 15 years plus. I have tried different electric razors; shave once with it, my face chopped up and beard still standing. I would either throw it away or give it away and gave up on electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;I believe I then got an e-mail from Amazon or I came across the Philips Norelco PT730 @ the Amazon site.&lt;br /&gt;I studied the electric razor, read info presented, and went to Norelco site to check this razor out.&lt;br /&gt;The price was awesome and I would receive it timely- I placed the order and received my razor within 48 hours.&lt;br /&gt;Once I unpacked the razor I got it started on charging.&lt;br /&gt;WOW after all these years I finally found an electric razor that provides a smooth shave without chopping my face up.&lt;br /&gt;This razor delivers everything they state it will; it has to be the triple head.&lt;br /&gt;I put the razor to the test shaving a three day growth. The razor provided a smooth shave. Cleaning the razor is a breeze- push a button, head pops up, and rinse out under running water.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone that wants a smooth shave-this is your electric razor. If you need to buy a gift - you will not go wrong with this choice.&lt;br /&gt;I have a minor concern; replacement heads are not sold at Amazon the last I checked. As I stated a minor concern that will not be an issue until next year.</li>
    <li> This shaver was above expectations.  I was going to order new shaving heads for my old Norelco but for a little bit more I could replace the complete shaver.  The PT730 holds a charge longer and gives a shave almost as close as a razor. I was a bit apprehensive when I first turned it on because it seemed to run slower than the old one and I was afraid the shave would suffer. This to my surprise was not the case. I would highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> It cuts great, but it holds water in it for a long time after you wash it and it runs out the end where the electric plug is. Should have had a water proof section at the end.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his new Norelco.</li>
    <li> I have always used Norelco and this one works fine</li>
    <li> I made my husband a happy man.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. I really like the PT730 shaver after using it for about a week now. I used a Schick Quatro for years. When the handle finally broke I decided to look at electric shavers and chose this one after reading all the (mostly) positive reviews. It does a fairly close shave once you get used to the different type of razor. It is quieter than I expected which is good since I am up before everyone else in the house. Overall I am pleased with this razor and would recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great battery and shaves well</li>
    <li> Works like a champ. Husband is very pleased with all aspects, especially that one can use it while it is charging.</li>
    <li> Works great on my 18 yr old sons beard.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good electric razor, especially when considering the price. It&#x27;s quite compact, light, and quiet, but doesn&#x27;t necessarily give the closest shave. The machine is washable, so that makes the cleanup fairly simple and convenient. The 8 hour charge time can be a hindrance at times, but your charging sessions will be far between each other unless you shave daily. Overall, I&#x27;d certainly recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a quite, reasonably cheap electric razor.</li>
    <li> just what i was looking for! excellent!</li>
    <li> Ask me again when the warranty expires. Too soon to tell.</li>
    <li> Good, Perfect, but sometimes  not clean  shave</li>
    <li> I like the razor and I like the way I can wash it with hot water under the faucet. It does a nice close shave, is easy to clean, the trimmer is nice, and it holds a charge well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me the motor sounds as if it is running at low revolutions, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> Did a pretty good job on my husband heavy beard.</li>
    <li> Great razor, works well, long time between recharges, well made. On/Off switch does not look too durable but has given no problems so far.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.  Average electric razor.  Takes MANY passes to get the hairs on the neck under your jaw.  HOWEVER, this thing has held a charge for many days and it is very quiet.  If you shave daily it may work better.  Anything more than two days growth and this razor HURTS when it shaves.  Tried it after 3 days growth and about went through the roof with pain from pulled hairs.</li>
    <li> I have probably used it once a week for the past 6 months, and it is still going strong and I haven&#x27;t had to replace the blades yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds a charge for a very long time, and it also charges up quickly. The extension for trimming beards and whatnot is also good quality. Go for it!</li>
    <li> This norelco product is one that I would recommend.  It gives a smooth and close shave everytime.I have been using a remington shaver for the past 10 years and this one to me is better.</li>
    <li> Very good razor. It shaves me  with  no pull. Fairly close shave too. Its easy to clean the blades.Its a bargain for the price.......</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my son who said it works great.&lt;br /&gt;The razor looks sharp too.  Thanks much!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my son. He has sensitive skin and gets irritation shaving with regular shavers. He likes it so far.</li>
    <li> Gift from my daughter.  Excellent travel razor.  I have another model for my daily use but use this one while on the road.  Would recommend to a friend!</li>
    <li> I usually use razor blades to shave, but for those times wehen you don&#x27;t have a lot of time, this rechargable razor gives a nice close shave in a very short time and at a price t5hat doesn&#x27;t break your wallet.</li>
    <li> it works great, just what i was looking for on my face.love the trimmer  and how easy it is to clean</li>
    <li> loving the electric razor and i am never ever going back to handle razor again! IT shave close and smoothly  update!! the thing broke on me very fast, less than a year and only one of the shaver side was working</li>
    <li> light and feel comfortable.</li>
    <li> I was replacing my Remington R7130 with this Philips Norelco PT730 Powertouch Electric Razor after having read several site reviews comparing it to much higher priced rotary and foil razors.  My Remington is MUCH better, but the trimmer died so I thought I was moving up in the razor area and would have a functioning trimmer.  This Philips weighs less, feels more plasticy and does not cut as close even with more applied pressure.  It just feels cheap.  For $60 an electric razor should get the job done, and this one barely performs.</li>
    <li> I have a light beard, so got a clean shave from day one. The rotary principle is the only way to go because no matter which way the hair is leaning, the rotary cutters will get em, and the floating cutter heads will adapt to the contours of the skin. Much, much more efficient than the fixed bar shaving heads.</li>
    <li> I travel a lot and this works in every place I&#x27;ve been (US, Brazil, Thailand, etc).  It&#x27;s a quality product and hard to beat for the price.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and son use one. Works well.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> We are very pleased with the razor. My husband need another one, as his old one quite.&lt;br /&gt;Could not have gotten a better replacement for his old one.  Can go a long time without&lt;br /&gt;recharging. Would recommend it to all my friends</li>
    <li> Very Nice shaver once your face gets in sync with it.&lt;br /&gt;easily cleaned, shaves close, smooth and doesn&#x27;t blotch my face like hand razors.&lt;br /&gt;leaves my face as smooth and clean as a babies butt. lol</li>
    <li> You just can&#x27;t beat this razor - for the price it does a fine job of providing a close shave&lt;br /&gt;it also holds a charge well and is easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;My previous version of this razor lasted about 3 years. I just repurchased this one and hope it too lasts as long.</li>
    <li> After roughly six months of use this Norelco has worked great.  Battery and charge is what I like most... gives me amount two weeks use without charging and clean close cut.  Also like being able to clean head and shave with water and soap.  Good design and price was reasonable in comparison to the last Norelco bought at the local &amp;#34;W&amp;#34; world.  Much easier buying through Amazon.</li>
    <li> does the job as expected</li>
    <li> My boyfriend uses this and said it was okay. It leaves him with stubble, but it doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin at all. I just wish I was a closer shave. http://peruserpaid.com/?ref&#x3D;141097</li>
    <li> Husband loved this razor, got the newest one this year, had the older version for quite a few years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this item for several months now, and it has worked very well.  It&#x27;s as well-made as my old Norelco, which gave me many years of reliable service.</li>
    <li> Very happy with razor and prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> The PT730 is a nice, effective razor, BUT, it&#x27;s $10 more and basically the same as the PT720 model, which my husband has also tried. The only noticeable different with PT730 is that is has a pop-up trimmer (which he barely uses) and the design is slightly more travel friendly - but not by much...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned with the PT720 review, the Lithium Ion battery holds the charge well. The box claimed that a full charge lasts up to 14 days - we haven&#x27;t tested it for that long, but it worked for a week just fine. A 3-minute charge is just enough for one shave - good for anyone in a rush. The shaving head is easy to clean and the cleaning brush is a nice accessory, although not really necessary as you can clean without out. The full 2-year warranty is a nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s a good razor, I just don&#x27;t get why they make so many different models which are essentially the same...</li>
    <li> Works well.  Happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been over 10 years since I regularly used an electric razor. I&#x27;ve owned at least 6 electrics of various brands and types (rotary, foil, etc.) over the years, and have always returned to using a blade after 6 months or so. I would always get tired of the skin irritation, the poor, uneven closeness of the shave, and the length of time a reasonably close shave would take. But I figured it&#x27;s been 10 years since I last tried one, and wet razors have made tremendous advances in closeness and comfort, maybe electrics have gotten better, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on an electric razor, but I also didn&#x27;t want the bottom end of the product line, so I went with the Norelco PT730 as it seems to offer some higher-end feature like a rechargeable Lithium-Ion battery, the \\&quot;Super Lift &amp; Cut\\&quot; blade system (which promises to offer a closer shave with less irritation), a built-in trimmer, and a fully washable design (which I was very interested in).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not all that much has changed with electrics in the past 10 years. Same basic shape and \\&quot;floating\\&quot; rotary blade layout as my last Norelco (no idea of the model number). They added some nice looking trim stripes, grippy surfaces, and ergonomic curves to the body, so it&#x27;s easier to hold onto. And it&#x27;s A LOT lighter than I remember my old one being. Probably a combination of the Lithium Ion battery and a lot more plastic parts - but that&#x27;s what you get today no matter what you buy. The \\&quot;controls\\&quot; (on/off, and trimmer) are easy to reach and activate, and have a quality feel like they will last for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and charged up the unit until the charging light lit up continuously (took roughly overnight). The next morning when I went to use it for the first time, I was struck just how quiet the shaver is in operation. I could probably use this in the master bathroom with the door closed and not wake my sleeping girlfriend. I was also worried that it was so quiet that it lacked the necessary power to do the job. Fortunately, I was worried for nothing because it powered through my 2 day beard growth without slowing noticeably. I didn&#x27;t have very high expectations for a close shave that first day because I needed to get used to using an electric razor again. Like every manufacturer warns in their owners manual, Philips Norelco has the standard disclaimer: \\&quot;Your skin may need 2 or 3 weeks to get accustomed to the Philips shaving system\\&quot;. I did however, find the shaver easy to hold and manipulate around the curves of my face. I got a decent shave, though no where near as close as a razor shave. It&#x27;s always a good idea to freshly wash your face just prior to shaving. This removes the facial oils that clog up a razor, and lifts the whiskers off your face for a closer shave. It&#x27;s VERY IMPORTANT to thoroughly dry your face first before using the razor as the moisture on your skin will cause the heads to drag making shaving most frustrating. They offer alcohol based pre-shave products that clean and dry your face faster than air alone. These can dry out the skin though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the shaver roughly every other day now for just about a month. I&#x27;ve gotten very comfortable with directing the razor over the different areas of my face. My beard grows very flat on my neck and requires many many passes in different directions to obtain a close shave. Just like every other electric razor I have owned this inevitably causes burning and irritation in that area after each shave.  Shaving this area on my neck is probably the biggest reason I don&#x27;t usually use an electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving my cheeks and jaw worked fairly well and I got a close shave in those areas after a few passes - not much irritation at all. I wear a goatee and getting in close around the edge of my facial hair was not easy. The circular blades have a border around them that attaches them to the shaver body. This border makes it somewhat difficult to get in close to the edge of my goatee and resulted in some light stubble remaining around the border of my goatee. The goal with well trimmed facial hair is a very close shave around this border which makes the goatee look very neat and sculpted. To be fair, this sharp, clean border is even difficult with a wet razor and requires practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shaving I love that I can just flip up the heads and rinse them off with hot water. Saves a lot of aggravation. I have a small spray bottle of alcohol that I spritz on the heads afterward to speed drying. (You&#x27;re supposed to let the heads dry before closing them back up.) They state in the manual: \\&quot;For the best cleaning results, we advise you to use the Philips Cleaning spray (HQ110).\\&quot; This stuff is basically alcohol with a bit of mineral oil in a spray can for 6 buck or so. Save your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the trimmer function a few times to \\&quot;pre-shave\\&quot; my beard when it was especially long after 3 or 4 days growth. It did trim my long whiskers somewhat but is under-powered for the job. I ended up using my Norelco beard trimmer to finish the job, as it is designed for this kind of work. The trimmer also does a lack-luster job at trimming the edges of my goatee and sideburns. But to be fair it is just as bad as every other built-in trimmer I&#x27;ve used in the past - so I&#x27;m not deducting any points for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t actually time my shaves but I estimate it takes me 5 to 7 minutes roughly every other day to get a close shave. I guess I got 3 - 4 full power shaves between each 8 hour recharge. I was running out of juice near the end of one shave and I plugged the unit in to finish it. A bit more awkward with the cord but it&#x27;s nice to know you won&#x27;t get stuck running out of power in the middle of a shave when you&#x27;re late for work! You can also do a quick 3 minute charge for 5 minutes of cordless shaving, though I didn&#x27;t try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not surprisingly, I still prefer the closeness and lack of irritation of a high quality 5-blade wet razor. And as usual because I have to spend so long repeatedly going over the same areas of my beard to get a close shave, there is really no time savings (for me) with an electric razor. But as far as electrics go the Philips Norelco PT730 PowerTouch Rechargeable Cordless Razor is a very nice product at a reasonable price point (I spent more for my last Norelco 10 years ago!). I found the ability to just flip-up the shaving heads and rinse them under hot water to be a real time saver, and it kept the razor performing much better between thorough cleanings involving disassembly of the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I can recommend this product as a very good choice in electric razors at a fair price for the features and performance.e remaining around the border of my goatee.

    <li> Great razor.  Bought it because Norelco stopped making the blades for my old one.  Shaves well, rinses out under water (good feature!)  Only issue was that it didn&#x27;t come with a case or pouch and the little plastic head protector would come off when you looked at it.  Since I couldn&#x27;t just throw it in a suit case in that condition, I bought a pouch from Norelco on line - but I shouldn&#x27;t have had to make a separate purchase.  That&#x27;s just cheap.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver and at a great price too!! Delivery time from USA to UK was unbelievably fast.</li>
    <li> Simple to use, shaves pretty good for an electric razor.  Holds an adequate charge, recharges quickly, and cleans easily.  For the price, its a very good buy and I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve read in other reviews, the blades run at a lower RPM than older shavers, but I took my chances and have not been disappointed. It shaves well, and is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This electric shaver is a piece of #%#%#%. It fell apart the second day I used it, literally the head just broke to pieces and there was no way to put it back together. Also, it didn&#x27;t shave well at all. I hate it, I don&#x27;t recommend it at all. This is a verified purchase. The worst part is you get no shave, not a bit, I can feel the whiskers on my face. The only reason I bought it is for travel purposes otherwise I&#x27;d stick with my disposable razors they&#x27;re much more reliable than this piece of junk. I bought a cheaper one here on Amazon only cause I need it for an upcoming trip to Peru and I don&#x27;t want to use the water over there, but once I get back I&#x27;m switching back to disposable razors. I wonder if it will even work at all, probably not. Stay away and don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality shaver, and the best thing is how long the batteries last.  I have a small area of facial hair to shave, so a full face would get less shaves, but for me it lasts for months, and the quality is very good.  Being able to rinse it under water is an easy way to clean it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my hubby but it doesn&#x27;t work that well and irritates his skin.  So dissapointed</li>
    <li> Works well, I still use my blade frequently because I have always preferred blades, but use this a couple times a week. Love the feel and the trimmer feature. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> never worked at all.  had to basically toss it. felt cheap and light.  I&#x27;m used to my father&#x27;s heavy old razor made by Philips.  I guess Philips has changed A LOT over the years and now they make cheap stuff that doesn&#x27;t hold up to even normal use.  Boo hiss.</li>
    <li> Great shave.  I wish it had a pop up trimmer.</li>
    <li> This product exceeded my expectations. I bought it because I&#x27;m on blood thinners from complications following knee replacement surgery and didn&#x27;t want to risk getting shaving nicks from blade shaving.&lt;br /&gt;This product is easy to use, gives a close shave and is very easy to clean. In other words, I love it.&lt;br /&gt;If I had known how good these were, I would have bought one years ago.</li>
    <li> It get&#x27;s the job done...eventually. I&#x27;m 51 years old and nothing has ever touched my face but a Norelco. I&#x27;m not a hairy beast that get&#x27;s a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow every day (no offense to hairy beasts!). This thing takes way more time and effort than my 6863 XL which has served me well for somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 years. It still works as long as you run it on a chord. 10 years and the only thing it could use is some fresh blades. This new PT730 get&#x27;s a bit closer when all is said and done but it takes more than twice as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is WEAK. I don&#x27;t care if a razor is loud so long as it get&#x27;s the job done. Honestly guys, have you ever been shaving and thought to yourself &amp;#34;Dang! This thing is loud! I wish it wasn&#x27;t so noisy!&amp;#34;? For someone to praise it for being &amp;#34;quiet&amp;#34; makes little to no sense to me. Who gives a (insert your favorite expletive) how quiet it is? Ever had a complaint from your significant other or your neighbor? &amp;#34;Honey, that is just too loud! Can you go do that in the garage?&amp;#34; I want the hair on my face to disappear and that&#x27;s all and I don&#x27;t want to spend 20 minutes doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is close once you fight with all of the stragglers and go over every inch of your face...many many times...in front of the mirror. Once it cut&#x27;s it&#x27;s close but it just doesn&#x27;t have any balls. Not a good choice of words but it gets the point across to the subject audience. This thing needs a few more RPM&#x27;s to make it a real razor that takes about 5 minutes to get the job done, not twenty...</li>
    <li> Very good results. Good value for price and for a quick shave! I would recommend this model as excellent value!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco rotarys for many years so nothing new. Does not shave as well as my last one because the shaving heads are brushed aluminum vs chrome, thus, more friction against the skin even though iI use Pre Electric skin preparation prior to shaving. Good price , excellent delivery. No problems</li>
    <li> Easy to use, Good shave . Easy cleaning.. I Love it..</li>
    <li> It takes too long to cut, so instead I prefer to use a trimmer that does not cut all the way down to the skin but leaves a little facial hair.</li>
    <li> Glad I read the reviews and opted for this model over the less pricey model -- definitely worth the difference in price.  I&#x27;ve used a Norelco rotary razor for decades and the biggest complaint is that they&#x27;re a pain to clean because of all the parts you have to keep paired up. This one allows me to clean it using hot water from the faucet without having to take it all apart -- a big time saver. Plus, it&#x27;s quieter than my last one and seems to give a closer shave. So it&#x27;s a real winner all around.</li>
    <li> This was my first electric razor of this type. I only fully shave once a week so this took my skin a lot of time to get used to. The first few times I&#x27;ve used it my skin was very irritated because it&#x27;s been so long since I&#x27;ve had a close shave. Eventually I got used to it and the irritation disappeared.  It cuts incredibly close on &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; surfaces like cheeks, however, using it all over the neck proved to be a little more difficult and required a regular razor to finish the job.</li>
    <li> The razor is easy to use and lightweight.  My husband had surgery on his thumb and it was difficult to shave.  Not any more!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the performance of this razor!  Feels very light in weight but delivers as good a shave as my last razor (also a Philips Norelco), which cost twice as much.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I hoped for. It performs beautifully but is so reasonably priced. I feel great about this purchase.</li>
    <li> The Phillips Norelco PT730 Powertouch Electric Razor really surprised me. The shaves are much closer than I ever expected, first electric I ever used. I wish I had tried this years ago. Highly recomend.</li>
    <li> I had used other Norelco shavers and then opted for a more expensive and highly rated alternative.  It was bad.  I returned to Norelco with this one and am amazed at the difference -- and I mean good.</li>
    <li> PLEASANTLY SURPRISED  quiet smooth  best electric razor I have ever owned. I have only used it for a few weeks but so far no problems  battery holds up well</li>
    <li> Very simple razor. Works very well. Pop-up trimmer is a nice touch</li>
    <li> I am first time user of electric razor, so it did took few days to settle with this. But I love it now, can&#x27;t think of going back to regular razor.</li>
    <li> Great Price! Did not see any comparable razor in this price range. Very good right out of the box. Using it for three weeks now. I have a moderate beard, am a senior citizen. Like the head washability feature very much. If you use very light pressure, you will get a very good shave. Seems to hold charge very well. I have not seen any issue with power when comparing it to the three previous electrics I have owned, maybe because it&#x27;s quieter. Amazon delivered several days before I expected it (std free shipping).</li>
    <li> Worth the extra over the cheaper ones - great shave.</li>
    <li> Hubby really likes it. Charges fast and can be used even when plugged up which he could not do with others. We travel a lot and often forget to plug it in, so this helps. It cuts close and smooth.Easy to hold in hand since I sneak a use for my legs every now and then(shh)</li>
    <li> Be advised: This razor was delivered yesterday. Opened it up, plugged it in, and no green light (which is the sign that it is charging). Changed plugs, tried everything, but never could get the green light on, meaning it is useless. Just got off the phone with customer service -- they will send me a new charger. But chargers are out of stock (I wonder why?), and it will probably be two weeks before they come in. So I sit with a brand new dead razor. Thanks, Norelco. Will update when I finally get a new charger and can finally use this thing, but for now, I am a very unhappy camper and would not advise purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor that provides a classic Norelco Triple Head shave. Ive owned Norelco Triple Head razors for decades and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed. This current model is lighter than previous ones and seems to have superior battery life and shorter charge times.  You can also clean it under running water if you wish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people complain that Norelco razors burn their skin, but in my experience this is the case with any electric razor until your skin becomes acclimated to it. I don&#x27;t think the Norelco is any better or worse in this regard. Another complaint is that electric razors don&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, which may be true. On the other hand, it&#x27;s easy to throw the Norelco in your brief case and do a quick touch up in your office, or in the back of a cab on your way to the airport. In almost any case and with almost any beard, the results will be superior to a blade you used several hours ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only personal complaints I have is that the pop-up trimmer is not very effective and the batteries are not replaceable. I rarely use the trimmer, a dedicated trimmer works way better and on my last Norelco razor the batteries lasted for over 7 years, so I really have no complaints.  This is an excellent razor for the money.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas,  he has used it daily for 9 months now and still loves it.  He did say today that the side burn trimmer wasn&#x27;t working. But all in all a good product.</li>
    <li> High quality and comfortable to hold.  I have used Norelco for many years and this is by far the best yet.</li>
    <li> It works very nice for me.</li>
    <li> Only had it a few weeks now but, love it~~especially compared to the previous shavers I&#x27;ve had. Very smooth shave with very little irritation or discomfort.</li>
    <li> typical norelco that is why I con&#x27;t to buy it. What can I say I am happy so far with their razors and for the price.</li>
    <li> What else can I say, it shaves my face, Works fine, very basic, and sturdy. Seems like it will last a good while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a single charge, it can last several several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+ product</li>
    <li> Works great.  Reliable.</li>
    <li> This shaver gives me razor burn whenever I use it under my chin, no matter how carefully I try to be.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time, gets job done, might be slower than old razor, but &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it at all.  Tore up my face. Left me feeling as if my skin was on fire.&lt;br /&gt;To be fair I only used it a few times.  Maybe you have to get used to them.&lt;br /&gt;Went back to soap and a razor.  Rather bleed than burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> when back to norelco to try new model&lt;br /&gt;so far so good  time will tell</li>
    <li> Had the unit about a year now. It does the job of shaving me. I guess that is all I can expect</li>
    <li> Was a gift and I think well received.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and he says it&#x27;s the best one he&#x27;s used.</li>
    <li> This razor is the best Norelco that I have purchased. It shaves very close. I replaced the blades after 6 months to keep it really sharp. It really does shave close.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Very light weight.  Just a nice shaver.</li>
    <li> It works ok, but not much better.  Make no mistake, this will not shave you as closely nor as smoothly as a good blade razor.  However it is convenient .  I am wearing a heart monitor for 28 days and wanted to be able to shave without risking getting the sensor on my chest wet, so I bought this.  It is ok for a quick knock down of your beard when you need it and can be used dry , so it is really nice to have on hand when you need it.  It takes a heck of a charge and you&#x27;ll really get several shaves off a full charge.  I think it irritates my skin more than my conventional razor, too, but this just may be a matter of getting used to it.  I&#x27;m using a electric pre-shave liquid and this helps some, but it still irritates the skin on my neck..  Clean up is easy, too.  Just rinse the heads out.  &#x27;Now if it would only give me that nice close shave I&#x27;m used to.  I am revising the rating downward to one lousy star.   After months of bad and painful shaves this morning while cleaning it it flew into many pieces.  After 40 minutes of trying to put it back together, I marched the P.O.S. to the nearest trash can and am rid of it forever!  Many years ago I was impressed with Norelco quality.  This was about as far from quality as one can imagine.</li>
    <li> A good norelco, takes a good charge, shaves close.Shaving with this type for many years.&lt;br /&gt;This is one of better ones.</li>
    <li> Have owned Norelco shavers in the past, but this shaver shaves closer than any other I have ever owned.  For the price, it is a bargain.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how quiet this thing is compared to my old Braun. I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for 30+ years and I must say that I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  Update - This is a fine shaver as long as you shave with a razor before or after using this shaver. Too many missing hairs. Going back to Braun or Remington</li>
    <li> Fast Response, product was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I bought it because an old Norelco rotary I had was easier on my neck in the summer time, but I preferred my Remmington Foil for the rest of my shave. This new razor was supposed to have better cutting heads and, although it gives a decent shave, it irritates my neck skin worse than the Remmington did. I&#x27;ve used it for a month, so maybe it will get better. Battery charge is good, over two weeks before recharge. Very light and easy to hold. I would recommend it as a good razor for the price. I paid about $45 on sale.</li>
    <li> Very quiet , does everything well about 90 %  five stars , 90 % is very good these days , cleans empty  in 4 seconds , dose not leave any ugly neck hairs uncut ... has sideburns trimmer , cord or cordless , easy recharge , but why bother. STEVE .F.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an electric razor.  It works, but it&#x27;s not great.  I may have to move off of the Norelco brand when this one stops working.  I&#x27;ve used their products for the past 25 years without trying another brand.  No matter what I do with these style razors, I always have to spend a ton of time shaving the same spots over and over again.  New blades and new techniques haven&#x27;t helped that.  It might just be my manly strong beard hairs or something...I don&#x27;t know..but I get tired of having to recharge this thing every few days just because it takes forever to get a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this price point, I don&#x27;t expect perfection or exceptional quality, but a shave is a shave is a shave.  Turn it on, cut the hairs so the face is relatively smooth, and move on with your day.  This does that, but it seems to take more time than it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars....I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s fair based on my experience.</li>
    <li> It works as well as any electric razor that I have used, better than most.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know how long it will last, but the length of battery charge, closeness of the shave, quietness, and kindness to my face have been excellent for the first 6 to 8 weeks.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have used this shaver for over a week and have no complaints. I&#x27;m pleased with the shave and comfort. Have a few issues when comparing to my previous Norelco.  One thing I am not pleased about is the wall wart power plug. I preferred the power conversion in the razor handle.  It is much easier to  travel with a small power cord instead of the the converter as a part of the plug on the wall.  (The old way also made the shaver feel more substantial.)  The speed of the blades seems to be significantly slower.  I think this is just something I need to adjust to after having used faster Norelco razors for the past 25 years.</li>
    <li> I ordered this partly because of the price, especially with the additional $5 off coupon.  I was impressed by this razor the first time I used it.  I initially thought that is sounded a little under powered from some of the reviews and to be honest, the first time I used it I have to agree it did sound underpowered.  However I found this to be powerful enough to cut through my stubble with no problem.</li>
    <li> A Great shave at a Great price. Tried other shavers but the Norelco gives the cloest and fastest shave of them all !</li>
    <li> I have used a foil shaver for many years and when I needed to replace my Panasonic shaver, I decided to go with the Norelco PT730.&lt;br /&gt;This has been a disappointment from the first day.  A tiny motor that requires many passes over the same area and then not really a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no battery level indicator which means you have to guess when to recharge the battery or just wait until it stops.&lt;br /&gt;I was also used to having an indication of when to clean the razor, but that is not here either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has been a big disappointmnet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelcos for over 40 years and the PT730 is, by far, the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. Just about as close as a blade, very quiet, and comfortable to hold and use.  It&#x27;s an outstanding product and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> First time I ever tried a Norelco. I didn&#x27;t think I would like a circular shaver, but my last Remington was so poor I thought I would try a Norelco. Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long. Fifty years of shaving wasted. I love my new Norelco PT730- and it&#x27;s so light. The only comment is it seems to take as long to recharge it whether I shave with it plugged in or on battery.</li>
    <li> My husband who has Parkinson and lives in a care facility can use this and shave himself.</li>
    <li> Efficient and comfotable.</li>
    <li> This is my third Norelco shaver in many, many years.  They have all lasted a long time and served me well.  This newest one is clearly the best ever and I highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> This razor has one thing going for it.  It shaves your face fast.  It doesn&#x27;t do a particularly good job, and it&#x27;s not even that cheap.  The battery lasts for a while, but if the charge gets low, then it&#x27;s next to worthless.  Just make sure you plan all your vacation time around whether or not your razor has a charge, and you should be good.  Or just take your charging cord along with you and settle for an average shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers for 50 years...The&#x27;re still the best around...this one is just as good as the more expensive models, and definitely better than any other brand.</li>
    <li> This is my second PT730.  They work great, my old one is still working. I got the new one because it cost almost as much to change the shaving heads (blades).  I shave every day and the shaving head is good for about 10 months.</li>
    <li> as described, arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why there are so many negative comments about the new Philips Norelco electric razors. I have been using Norelco for over 30 years and this new one is a very good razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was NOT made in China - the packaging says made in Netherlands. It IS much quieter, and I think that causes users to perceive that it is not running as strongly as older units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replaced my old Norelco because the shaving heads cost more than a new razor. The new one worked very well the first time I used it, since my face did not have to become accustomed to electric razors. I realize the comparison to my old unit is flawed because the shaving heads on my old razor needed replacing, but I have no complaints about the PT730 on my neck, or face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I notice is their warning about not pressing too hard on the skin or you will distort the foils on the heads. I had to think consciously while shaving, and it&#x27;s actually nice not to have to bear down to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It actually cost $10 less to buy this shaver than to replace the heads on my old unit, and I am experiencing results as good as I would have expected with my old shaver if I had opted for replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives - light; quiet; good shave, can use with cord; easy to clean; good pop-up trimmer; much better on-off switch than old (sliding) unit had; Lithium Ion batteries which will not get &amp;#34;memory&amp;#34; like NiCads and refuse to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives - no storage cradle (it fits in the old cradle I have); no leather case (it fits into the old leather case); cord is skinny &amp;#34;phone charger type&amp;#34; instead of heavy coiled AC charging cord from old unit; lacks the series of LEDs to indicate state of charge (but there ARE LEDs to show full charge and no charge).</li>
    <li> excellent shaver, powerful, easy to use, reasonable price, much better than my old Norelco.</li>
    <li> ordered for my husband. he really likes it. he shaves more often, now.  :)</li>
    <li> After two years and one month, it just stopped while shaving. the LED near the on/off switch would blink five times and then stop. Sadly, 1 month out of warranty. I will buy something else next time.</li>
    <li> As close a shave as I have ever had. Simple and cost effective. Would have cost almost as much to replace the head on my old razor. Love it.</li>
    <li> I can not hesitate in saying that this is one nice shaver. I&#x27;ve used it just four times,  and I really like it, it makes shaving really easy. It shaved my face really smooth, it gets difficult areas around my upper lip, and even gets hair underneath my nose. I have tough spots on my chin and it handles those with ease.  Never felt a pull or tug on any hair. I was amazed at how well it cut two days of hair! Every review that says this is a great shaver, I agree with, and I really have a hard time thinking that this in a negative way, or it doesn&#x27;t shave properly- for the price it works really really well and I hope this shaver will continue to be with me for a long time and perform the nice way it does!</li>
    <li> Just another electric shaver.  Average. Nothing special.  Over priced.</li>
    <li> Love it, I strongly recommend this product it&#x27;s worth having and good for the price.</li>
    <li> The razor works extremely well, my face adjusted to it within 1 week, holds a good charge as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband in March 2014. It was never dropped or abused in anyway. It was used daily. Needless to say, it&#x27;s already in the garbage!! A true p.o.s. I DO NOT by any means recommend this particular razor and neither does my husband!</li>
    <li> no improvement over my old shaver</li>
    <li> I have had this for a couple of years, replaced the heads once (they recommend replacing every year). It has plenty of power to last two weeks between charges, for me. Does not seem to be losing battery power, yet. Feels comfortable in the hand, easy to maneuver around my face.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco electric razors for over a half century (and still have, in working order, the early two head version) and found them better than old and new rivals. The current version does a good job of shaving and the ability to rinse the razor proved useful. My only complaints are that the charger is flimsier than in the past and recharging time is much longer.</li>
    <li> Yes, it certainly is true that it takes some time to get used to Norelco razors.  Training yourself to slow down and do a little facial skin stretching was the key for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a long-time fan with tender skin, I can say that this particular model really does a nice job while keeping skin irritation to a minimum.  It&#x27;s much better for me than the slightly less expensive PT720 - my previous razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So ... If you have tender skin, I&#x27;d say this is ideal for you!</li>
    <li> Exactly what we wanted.. Could not find this product at local stores.  Has a great cut  Highly reccommend this product</li>
    <li> Using this shaver reminds me of the scene from \\&quot;A game of thrones\\&quot; when Theon Greyjoy tries to cut off Ser Roddrick&#x27;s head but needs three swings and a kick to finish the job.  After hacking away at my poor face with this flimsy, overly decorated $50 dull electric cheese grater until my eyes welled up with the first tears they have shed since my testicles descended, I gave up and had to finish off my more loyal whiskers with my lucky razor, which turned five months old last week.</li>
    <li> Everything works well on this product. It provides a smooth comfortable shave and the pop-up trimmer actually works, and works well, compared to some other brands I&#x27;ve used in the past. It has a lithium battery so it holds a charge for at least a week. I always recharge by then and it hasn&#x27;t run low yet. It is exceptionally quiet and is easy to clean. The only negative is that it didn&#x27;t come with a travel case but I saved the old one which works fine. Thoroughly pleased with the price and performance. Just to use an old cliche... for a shave as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0073YEN2M TROPHY (The Trophy Saga)]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0075CFCX6 TROPHY: RESCUE (The Trophy Saga)]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too savvy on the usage of Electric razors, but compared to most of the other ones I&#x27;ve used, this is a really good shave. Considering that it was cheap (I got it for $40) and that it is waterproof along with the fact that it shaved my 3 month old beard off like it was butter, I consider this to be a really good (presumably) middle of the road razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you just want a good razor that does it&#x27;s job, I would suggest this one and maybe shy away from the more expensive ones unless you have the money and are willing to spend it on a fancier razor that streams football or something silly like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tl;dr good razor, cheap, and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> still love it after 2 years</li>
    <li> Love it! Long battery life and close shave.</li>
    <li> My husband has been a Norelco shaver user for over 40 years. He is very pleased with his new shaver -- absolutely no complaints!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my son, he loves it.</li>
    <li> I usually use a Gillette Fusion razor in the morning, but wanted to see if this was any faster.  It took my face a little while to get used to it, but after a while I find it works well on short stubble.  I use this for a quick shave in the morning before I shower especially when I use a scrub since my skin is less sensitive than when I use the Fusion.  It rinses out in the sink, which is super easy.  I love that I can just pick this up and tidy up my face quickly when I am in a rush.  I still prefer the blade razor closeness, but this is pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I go a day, though, this is more of a hassle and takes longer.  Then a Fusion is a win.  If you use this every day, though, it works great.  Go two days without a shave and this will be painful and slow.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver.  It fits his hand, gives a smooth shave and is gentle on his skin.  Not much more can be said nor is needed to be said!</li>
    <li> Have been using older model Norelco shaver.  Like the way the new one cuts and easy cleaning.  First time doing complete cleaning other than rinsing took a little time to fiqure out head alingment.  Now much easier.  Works well on shaving my square chin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelcos for 20 years. Always satisfied with the product but not happy about the constantly rising prices. Many of the high end models have readouts and digital features I don&#x27;t need. When it was time to replace my last razor I noticed this one on the Amazon site. The price was a lot more user-friendly than some of the high end models. I&#x27;ve used it for three weeks or so, shaves great, definitely worth the $$.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I&#x27;m comparing this to a Remington, which was my old unit. I have a Phillips Norelco body groomer which I absolutely love, so I thought I would give there shavers a try! I have to say I&#x27;m kind of disappointed. I have to shave daily, I have regular facial hair, nothing course or fine, pretty normal density. I have to go over the same spot about 10 times for it to cut all the hair off and give me a clean shave. I don&#x27;t know if this is a common issue with circular blades, as I was using a foil shaver before?? Not sure. The pop up trimmer is also just okay, I have to dig into my skin for it to cut and trim my sideburns. Battery life is excellent, the charge time is excellent, and the colored battery indicators are nice as well. It is easy to clean, easy to change the blades as well. It&#x27;s light weight, ergonomic and comfortable to hold (as you&#x27;ll be holding it a while). Besides the time it takes to shave and how many passes I have to take to actually cut the hair, the unit is nice. Although when it&#x27;s time to replace this, I think I may go back to a foil electric razor. Hope this review helps you to make an informed decision!</li>
    <li> This shaver works great.  I would recommend it to anybody.  I use it every day.  It shaves really close and I like that you can rinse it off under the faucet.</li>
    <li> This Norelco, like others I have used in the past, provides an excellent shaving experience, fits the hand comfortably and is convenient. It also avoids the watery mess around the bathroom sink that my wife complains about.  BUT, for all that, the closeness of the shave is not that of blade razor.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this Norelco to those who shave more than once a day.</li>
    <li> I have been using electric razors for nearly forty years, this one is the best to date, it shaves smooth, cleans up easy, and the battery only needs charging once in a blue moon. In I have only charged it when I first got the razor, and it is since running on that original charge, I guess that&#x27;s about a month ago.</li>
    <li> Just the quality expected</li>
    <li> This has been a fine shaver. No matter what anyone says, no electric shaver is as close as a blade but this does a fine job. Once charged, it will last about a month of daily shaving. It&#x27;s a very nice, comfortable shaver.</li>
    <li> Not as clean as a shave with a blade, but for the price and convenience sake, a pretty good deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m handicapped, a partial quad so using only one hand is a must  for both shaving and cleaning. Smooth and easy makes it all good, thanks for the help.</li>
    <li> I liked it so much for myself I bought two more for my sons.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco products for longer than I care to remember.  This is the worst POS that Norelco has ever foisted upon the public.  It does not cut hair, long or short.  I have gone back to using a blade and the Norelco makes a fair paperweight.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my razor.  It gives a smooth clean shave and is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Good shave for 5 years... Great coverage across the neck.  I might want new blades though.</li>
    <li> Very nice and reliable shaver. I am very impressed with how long the battery stays charged. Would certainly recommend.</li>
    <li> adequate but low rpms with these new norelco shavers just simply don&#x27;t give you that great shave their older models used to give with the higher rpm motors. the power cord which is something new as well is clumsy and not very efficient compared to the old style cord with the older models. bottom line is norelco please bring back your older models. if it ain&#x27;t broke don&#x27;t fix it!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the first razor that I have been able to use every day..It does not shave quite as close as my foil razor but again it is great for every day use.&lt;br /&gt;Does not burn my skin like the foil razor does.</li>
    <li> a good shaver, affordable and fast, easy to clean, the American version has a beard trimmer but the Canadian model doesn&#x27;t. But like most electric shavers, it doesn&#x27;t cut as close as using manual disposable razors.</li>
    <li> Shaves close and is easy to clean. Long battery life</li>
    <li> Hubby was expecting something that did not pull on his face.  He developed a rash from using this.  As a result, I now use for shaving my legs.</li>
    <li> This razor was a small but very good for every day use I use it every day&lt;br /&gt; for someone who doesn&#x27;t have a lot ot time for shaving this is a good razor</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this shaver.  It&#x27;s quiet, smoooth, and shaves very close.  It&#x27;s easy and convenient to clean as well.</li>
    <li> With this price, I think I got the best product. It works just as I expected.I would recommend this for anybody</li>
    <li> I bought as a gift for my 17 year old grandson and he loves it says it is easy to use and clean.  He just started shaving and wanted an electric razor and my husband always bought Norelco, so I stuck with their product.  Good choice.</li>
    <li> Lighter in weight than the old 7800XL it replaced; shaves closer and seems to hold charge as well as the older model.</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t pass up this deal, used to have an electric razor 15 years ago, but this one works much better</li>
    <li> Pros: Good shaving performance. Easy to clean. Reputable company and two year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: No battery meter (just a light to indicate when a charge is needed). No stand or carrying case. Somewhat cheap-feeling construction. Expensive replacement blades (not an issue for me because I find that they last the lifetime of the shaver).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good, no-frills shaver but only a fair value for the money.</li>
    <li> This unit does a great job. Battery life is excellent too. I was worried that the lower rpm&#x27;s (compared to a plug-in unit.) would be a problem. No problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using mine for about 2 months now. I originally thought that since it is so quiet that it lacked power of my older Remington rotary. Not true. I am getting a very good shave in less time (maybe my blades were a little worn on the old Remington). For the price, I think this was a very good buy. I even took it for a long-weekend trip without the charger and it performed just as usual. I hope it lasts 7-8 years like my last one did. If so, then I will be extremely happy.</li>
    <li> good price when i brought, also good user experience as well, i love it&lt;br /&gt;better than old one pt720. haha</li>
    <li> I chose the PT730 because it was a Norelco which I have always liked and the least expensive model i found with a built in trimmer. I find it gives quick, easy close shaves.</li>
    <li> I bought this for someone I know who is non-tech savvy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By that I mean, I will get asked the question - &amp;#34;Hey, how do you make a new paragraph in a Word document? &amp;#34;(Thwacks Head.) Oh, my, oh my, oh my! You can&#x27;t teach an old dog digital tricks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My family member (who shall not be named - hubby) needed, or say, &#x27;wanted&#x27; a portable device to watch YouTube Videos. The thought of shelling out money for a laptop was too great. The Kindle Fire was the next best thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small in size, fits easily in one hand and very light weight. Even though this one wasn&#x27;t HD, the colors were still brilliant to watch a video. Family member (hubby) didn&#x27;t have any problems surfing via the Kindle browser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;2. Clear and brilliant videos.&lt;br /&gt;3. Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s not a laptop, don&#x27;t treat it as one.&lt;br /&gt;2. You can&#x27;t download apps from Google Play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True-Speaking:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For YouTube video junkies who just want to sit on the sofa and watch the latest movie trailers or whatever - perfect gift idea.</li>
    <li> Love It!  It shaves better than my razor!  Plus you do not have to keep it on a charger to us it!</li>
    <li> Only had a short time but love the close shave. The charges last a long time and is so easy to clean.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver.  He constantly compliments it.  Does very well.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver, fast delivery, great price - all is perfect. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I really always preferred a blade and shaving cream.  After having surgery a few years back, a friend gave me a Norelco to use because a regular razor and shaving cream would not be advisable for me to use for several months.  I got used to it and liked using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I moved, it got packed away and I couldn&#x27;t find it, so I bought this one.  It is just an updated version of the other one I had.  This one does the job pretty well also.  I do have to go over some stubborn areas more than once due to my tough beard, but overall this razor fits the bill and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good product at a good price.</li>
    <li> Best shaver!  Works well.</li>
    <li> Close shave. Great replacement for old one. Only con is shaving moustache the head will not let me get as close as I would like</li>
    <li> The blades are too close to the grid and if you&#x27;re not really careful they will clip you skin when you shave. There&#x27;s no ability to adjust that distance, like I had in my previous shaver, a Norelco Spectra 8865 Xl. Other features have also been degraded compare to the 8865. Maybe I should have bought one of the more expensive shavers which Norelco sells. Anyway, the shave is indeed closer and the shaver is quieter and lighter.</li>
    <li> Very nice shaver, and easy enough to use. The new razor is so much quieter than the old Norelco it replaced. Being able to use the razor while corded makes it all the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Norelco rotary shavers over 30+ years, and this one is probably my 5th or 6th one. It shaves every bit as good or better than any of them. The trimmer is what I am accustomed to and IMHO it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some complaints about the plastic being too thin, but in hand it feels just like any other Norelco razor. I don&#x27;t know how it would survive a hard drop to the floor, but I don&#x27;t plan on finding out. Quality wise, it looks as good as the 10-year-old Norelco it replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I&#x27;m not crazy about the new cord style with the small, step-down brick transformer for the AC side, but it gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to rotary shavers, beware that you must give your skin a couple weeks to get used to the idea. After that, you&#x27;ll probably not want to go back to a regular razor.</li>
    <li> Husband is so pleased with his new shaver! He is originally from East Africa, so his hair is very curly and coarse. Too, he has sensitive skin. We won&#x27;t know how it will perform in the long haul but glad it&#x27;s doing the job now.</li>
    <li> Been using these for years but still room for improvement.</li>
    <li> Great product. The charge last for days and the shave is clean. The product is also very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I bought this electric razor after reading the other reviews and I am glad I bought it. I use this razor to shave my head 2-3 times a week and it does a real good job. If I ever forget to charge it the day before I can charge it a few minutes before using it and that will be enough for me to finish my shave. I recommend this razor to anyone who wants a good and affordable electric razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several of this general type of razor from Philips over the years. This one seems good, and the battery life is a major improvement compared with the one I had.&lt;br /&gt;However, I can not stand the placement of the on/off button. See that nice sculpted area where your thumb wants to be? That&#x27;s where they put a push-on/push-off button. So as I shave, I push the button and the razor shuts off. A pain, in more ways than one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I hold it more awkwardly and live with it, but I hope Philips reads these reviews and moves it!</li>
    <li> Bought this exact item (although model number is different) 5 years ago for my husband.  The rotary blade is the original from 5 years ago and started getting dull only recently. Great performance without having to change the head once!  Decided to buy a new razor only because the price point is so reasonable and getting everything new vs. buying just a replacement head was a nice gesture to my husband.&lt;br /&gt;This razor is light weight and easier to handle due to the plastic used in manufacturing, but this does not affect it&#x27;s performance or durability. This razor does just as good a job as the pricier model he owns, which he has not used since getting this model 5 years ago.</li>
    <li> if you have long stubble, it doesn&#x27;t pick it up very good.  Good battery life - and the trimmer works well.</li>
    <li> All that is promised in this shaver is correct.  It has power to give a close shave and stays charged without the cord for a long while.</li>
    <li> The shaving is not very deep . You have to load it frequently. Otherwise it is okay. Thank you. Ahmed Khosrowshahi</li>
    <li> This product is terrible. It is very difficult to clean and impossible to put together after you cleaned it. The parts are plastic, there are many of them and next to impossible to reassemble not because you don&#x27;t know how to reassemble but because they don&#x27;t want to stay in place. You need to clean and disassemble the product on almost an every day basis.  I do not recommend this product and am returning it.</li>
    <li> Have owned nothing but Norelco shavers for 30 years--I gave up the screen and never looked back. Aside from the great shave, I was always impressed with the precision and durability of the machinery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No so with this device. The structural parts of the head are soft plastic and everything feels loose and sloppy. After only a few months with it, I am looking into a new head because this one buzzes and shakes so much. It takes me 3 times as long to shave as when it was new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good things about this razor are the battery life and that it can be rinsed. They introduced water-resistance a few generations back and that was genius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping it is just this model and that I only need to reach a step or two up the ladder for my next one. I&#x27;ll give the new head a try first but I hope I don&#x27;t have to give up on the Norelco electric. Only a blade ever matched it in the past.</li>
    <li> I have used a foil electric razor for years and keep buying the same type because it said it gave you the closest shave.  After reading the ratings on the PT730, I thought that I would give it a try.  I certainly was not disappointed.  It is with out a doubt the best shave that I have ever had with an electric razor.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not necessary to spend upwards of $200.00 for the shaver that has unnecessary extras. This is your basic shaver and my husband loves it.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco razors for 30 years or more, and each one seems to be a little better.  This one does a very good job, and holds a charge for a reasonable length of time.  It also seems to recharge fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only (minor) complaint that I have is that it just quits cold when the charge gets low.  With my older Norelco razors, I can hear the motor begin to slow when the battery charge is getting low.  Since I usually shave in the car while driving to work, it can be quite handy to have some advance warning before the razor dies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product description says that an LED indicator panel lets you know when it&#x27;s time to recharge, but I haven&#x27;t seen that so far.  It may be that I&#x27;m missing something, and I will be sure to check for this more often.  Of course I won&#x27;t normally SEE the signal while I&#x27;m using the razor, unless I happen to be shaving my forehead. (I don&#x27;t)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, I have no regrets about purchasing this razor.  I&#x27;m not giving it the full 5 stars, but I would not hesitate to recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> Got this shaver when it was on a great deal. Always wanted to try. This one is powerful enough to shave off decent growth of 2-3 days, I seriously doubt if growth is more than that. Cleaning is easy and definitely it is a nice gift..</li>
    <li> Works good - have to get used to it as have always used Remington but slowly but surely am going to be happy with it</li>
    <li> This product is good, and it works for me though I have thick hair on my face specialy on my chin , It&#x27;s flexible can be washed under tap water , easily cleaned , easily stored and cut the hair in smooth painless way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somtimes when I press it too hard on my face my skin become sensitve but still painless and pinchless , so use it in a proper way that fits your skin , not too light so it do nothing and you blame the Norelco and not too hard so it eat you skin (don&#x27;t be scared guys)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;still I recommend it to the people with moderate skin (I don&#x27;t think it works good on the guys with thick facial hair)</li>
    <li> My husband used Norelco brand shavers for over 40 yrs.  Now I&#x27;m buying them for my son-in-law.  And he loves them.  Keeps them charged, one at home and one in the car in case he&#x27;s a little late for work, shaves on the way.</li>
    <li> This shaver fits in your hand nice and dose a wonderful job cutting those whiskers and makes your face feel smooth.</li>
    <li> I really like my new Norelco shaver.. Shaves decent and holds charge a long time. Shave not as close as a blade but close enough.</li>
    <li> I needed replacement heads for my old norelco.  With the discount this new one cost only $13 more and had the features that i wanted.  It is really nice to be able to use it plugged in and the trimmer is a must.  Great Shave!</li>
    <li> as above. the powertouch electric razor did a good job,aaa aaa aa a  a a a a a a a a</li>
    <li> I keep an electric razor for one reason: being late and being able to shave in the car. I don&#x27;t remember the previous Norelco model I had (which, after several years of dependable use, could no longer hold a charge), but it was a lower-end model, I&#x27;m sure. This PT730 is very inferior to that model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, as other reviewers have pointed out, the motor is much weaker than previous Norelcos. This, as I found out the hard way, is actually quite important if you have a few days growth of beard to shave. I was late for a doctor&#x27;s appointment, had 2-to-3 days growth of beard, and spent 15 minutes TRYING to get this brand new, fully-charged shaver to do its job. The upper face took quite a while. The neck/under-chin area was - believe it or not - nearly impossible to shave and I gave up after a long while, fearing a bright red neck from irritation (I don&#x27;t have an explanation as to why it couldn&#x27;t cut the neck hairs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous Norelco always did the job. This Norelco is quite inferior. Even though I paid only $27 via Amazon discounts/coupon, I am very disappointed in this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 1/10/2013: After using this on one day&#x27;s beard growth - as most people would use this I suppose - I can understand why others have given this high ratings. It does do a good job, though it takes longer than a higher-powered razor would. However, I&#x27;m sticking with the 2 stars: if you decide not to shave over the weekend, do NOT expect this thing to handle 3 days of beard growth on Monday morning, it simply cannot handle it.</li>
    <li> Newly redesigned shaver series offers advantages previous models lacked making this PT series 22nd century.&lt;br /&gt;Price was most more than advantages.</li>
    <li> It is performing great at this time. Why are you asking for thirteen more words? Isn&#x27;t my comment enough. No-Yes</li>
    <li> I always had Norelco shavers and they all worked well including this one. I recommend this at this value price.</li>
    <li> Never been a big fan of cordless razors, but I&#x27;ve always kept one around for quick touch-ups and when I&#x27;m running late. The main feature of this [[ASIN:B006GQYSGO Philips Norelco PT730 Powertouch Electric Razor]] is that (stop me if you&#x27;ve heard this before) it has two cutting edges. The first blade cuts longer hairs and pulls whiskers off the surface of the skin, then the second blade comes along and cuts the shorter ones even closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t which to credit - the new-ness of this shaver compared to the 4-year-old I left, or the cutting-edge double-blade technology they&#x27;re so proud of, but these first dozen or so shaves have been very smooth and close, with virtually none of the burn electrics tend to leave. The rotary head that give and take independently definitely help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall design is pretty sleek, the LED battery level indicator is easy to read, and a full charge gives you 40 minutes of run time which seems like a lot.  This shaver beat my expectations, better in every way than any electric I&#x27;ve owned before.  I&#x27;m not quite ready to go electric full-time - there&#x27;s $60 of Gillette razor blades I&#x27;d have to use up first - but at least this razor leaves me thinking it&#x27;s possible now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Braun single-foil shaver for about six years, and when the trimmer attachment broke on that, I decided to try something different. The description for this product hyped the close shave and movable heads and the reviews looked good, so I gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the product came my first impression is that it felt lightweight and sounded like a toy. I&#x27;ve now been using it for six months and I&#x27;m convinced of its durability, and the quieter motor is a nice benefit compared to the Braun. The ergonomic-looking shape is actually awkward to hold, but that&#x27;s not a big deal. It&#x27;s easier to clean than the Braun since the whole head unit flips open and closed quickly. The battery life is also an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the shaving performance, I can report that it is exactly identical to my old shaver. I gave my face a month to adapt to the new cutter, then did a few experiments where I shaved one side of my face with the old shaver and the other with the new shaver. Immediately after the shave, or that evening, or the next day, I could see or feel no difference whatsoever. All the hype in the product description is just that -- hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had hoped to get a closer or quicker shave with a new product; instead I got the same shave with a couple minor upgrades. Nothing to complain about, but a bit disappointing.</li>
    <li> Works great, well worth the money paid. This Product Gives a good shave and is easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this razor.  It is quieter than his old Remington.  He says that it is significantly slower than the Remington.  I think what he likes the most is that it is sharp and therefore doesn&#x27;t pluck out occasional whiskers.</li>
    <li> Second razor of this brand and type owned by husband - says it is very good.  Last one was a little fancier and re-charged much faster but this one shaves just as well.</li>
    <li> This is the quietest shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned....  So quiet, in fact, that it seems like it&#x27;s running too slow to work.  This has led some reviewers to say that it&#x27;s underpowered.  But somehow Norelco has managed to make a shaver that runs slow and quiet, but still shaves as well as any other shaver in its price range.  At first I, too, thought it was underpowered, but then I discovered that it works!  Amazing.</li>
    <li> This is a much better shaver and cuts much closer than the one I previously had which was a Panasonic brand. I&#x27;m glad I went back to Norelco.</li>
    <li> This is probably my fifth Norelco razor over 15 plus years. For the price, I found Norelco to be the most consistently best low cost razor. This one is no exception. It seems to have more power and longer battery use between charges.</li>
    <li> My facial hair is not thick so this razor works perfectly for me. I can see if you have thick/coarse facial hair that this may not do as well as other models, but for me it is perfect.</li>
    <li> I have had the shaver about a month and a half, and so far , it is working fine. I have charged the battery 3 times. The RPM is much lower than all the other Norelco&#x27;s that I have had, but it shaves close, smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;The battery charge indicator is far less than desired, but otherwise it appears to be OK. It is made in China.</li>
    <li> Gets me going faster than an regular razor.  Cheaper too because I not buying blades all the time any more.  At first the shave doesn&#x27;t feel as close as a blade shave but you know what? It is close.</li>
    <li> To start with the good points... The razor is quite powerful and feels good to hold.. The battery charge is also good and packing etc was great as well. Now the issues, causes a lot of irritation and reddishness after shaving and needs several repetitions under the neck area. Does not give a close shave as compared to a traditional razor. I have hence returned it. I am planning to go in for one of straight parrell blades.</li>
    <li> Great for my needs! Rinse out with water -- great!</li>
    <li> shaves nice and smooth love it</li>
    <li> better than i thought for the price. Got this as a spare for my travel kit; shaves as well as the expensive 3 ring Norelco I use at home.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> The recipient likes it.</li>
    <li> Yes, this new one is good, better than the model that came before this newer one.&lt;br /&gt;I find them all a bit expensive for what it is, nothing special or fancy by this particular model.&lt;br /&gt;of-cause one can spend more and get a more fancy model, it does its work and it does it OK, but that&#x27;s all....</li>
    <li> Got this for my dad. He loves it.</li>
    <li> works, battery lasts a fairly long time. Razor cuts my neck real bad in many places.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over 6 months and overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.  I like being able to rinse it with water to keep it clean.  It seems to hold a charge pretty long, I charge it every 1 - 2 weeks.  The shave is fine, not much different than most electric razors I&#x27;ve had over the years.  It is pretty easy to take about when you want to give it a good cleaning.</li>
    <li> it is very good,i want to buy  one!the price  it is very cheap,it is good  good  good&lt;br /&gt;it is very good,i want to buy  one!the price  it is very cheap,it is good  good  good</li>
    <li> Skipped shaving this morning as I knew my new Norelco was due to be delivered today.  Just finished a close shave with no irritation.  Could ask for no more.</li>
    <li> Save your money and look at Remington non rotory shave. This Norelco has the power of a wind up toy and is capable of nothing worthy enough to be called a razor. Really a perfectly awful product.i</li>
    <li> My husband is very happy with this product. Easy to use and lightweight compared to old model. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Very good razor.  Clean shave, easy clean, Holds charge a good length of time. The only drawback for me is that it does not come with a case.</li>
    <li> This razor does a great job shaving away hairs on and around your face. The battery lasts a long time and cleaning it is super easy. The shave is not super close, so some may prefer a different razor that shaves even closer.</li>
    <li> I had a remington shaver and it was so bad I read the reviews on this norelco and was impressed so I gave it a try the very best shave I ever had much better than the remington I know it is a mans shaver but it shaves much better than a ladies one. I also bought one for my mom she loves it also</li>
    <li> Fabulous shave, Easy to use. Easy to clean. I put off getting an electric shaver for too many years, but now I would not go back to the blade and shaving cream. The electric shaver is faster, not messy to use, and best of all, not more nicks on my face as a result of shaving.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the highest technology available but it works great and didn&#x27;t cost a lot.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> At first I was sceptical about the product.  It seemed like a step down from my prior shaver but I must confess, I get a better cut.  The only knock is it takes 8 hrs to get 40 or 50 minutes of power but it lasts a long time.  Just schedule the  recharcing at the right time and you are home free.  A lot better than my Remington.</li>
    <li> My husband loved this razor with all the attachments provided. Its quick and less time consuming for shaving everyday.Great Buy</li>
    <li> Removes hair, clipper is top notch. Stays charged for quite a while. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Very good razor with excellent battery life between charges.</li>
    <li> Another good reasonably priced razor from Norelco.  Good battery life.  The cord from the charger falls out if there is any strain on it but a bit of consideration takes care of that.</li>
    <li> Not an everyday shaver guy but this does fine. Easy to clean, light in the hand and holds a long charge. Just got sick of the cost of blades.&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer is fine for sideburns and beard...not good for mustache. It&#x27;s too wide for that. As I shave every-other day, I need a bit more time and care, but it&#x27;s a good shave. I feel no pulling as some reported and did not have any burn or discomfort. Booklet did same give it 3 weeks to get used to but I was good right out of the box. For the price...I like it very much!</li>
    <li> My best Norelco razor ever.  This is a precision instrument that gives a close shave and glides smoothly over your skin.  Easy razor clean up with a water rinse, and more shaves per charge.</li>
    <li> The shave of this razor is just fine... no different than previous Norelcos I&#x27;ve had.  And I like the trimmer feature. But I&#x27;m blown away by the battery life! My last razor had gotten down to less than a week on a charge; and out of the box this one gave 5 full weeks of everyday shaving.  No more having to take the charging cable with me on trips!</li>
    <li> I had no idea what I was looking for but apparently I made the right decision because my husband loves it. Super fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Good comfortable.  Shave ok but could be closer.</li>
    <li> I like this one. It replaced an older Norelco 3 head razor. The new one is lighter. I  assume this is because of improved battery technology. I will report back when I see how long a charge lasts.  The heads are mounted in a more flexible manner which is way more comfortable. They seem to do better with the longer hairs that result from my somewhat haphazard shaving style.  The pop up trimmer is essential for proper mustache sculpting and that seems unchanged. It works well. It took about five years to wear the old one out. I&#x27;d say go for it.  01-11-14  Update- The length of time this holds a charge is exceptional. I charged it on Christmas day and have not had to charge since. I have been using it daily just to see how long it would last. The light weight is nice. I was afraid that it would mean a weaker battery but it does not. I am pleased.  1-30-15   Update- More than a year later I need to give a progress report. Since I got this I have charged it twice. This was not because it slowed down but because I was taking it on a trip  and didn&#x27;t want to take the charger. The last charge was in August last year.  Yesterday the low power light came on for the first time and I had to charge it. That is five months of daily use on one charge! I also like being able to run the shaving head under the faucet to clean it. This is a very nice razor!</li>
    <li> I use this item daily with NO problems.  I&#x27;d buy another one in a flash.</li>
    <li> After years of using a manual razor, the PT730 is easy on the skin. Provides a close shave. Good quality at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> el producto llego en  excelentes condiciones, llego en el tiempo pactado y lleno mis expectativas sobre el producto. los recomiendo. very good</li>
    <li> got this for my husband for his birthday - I&#x27;ve bought multiple razors in the past 6 years and he&#x27;s always had them tear up or not get all the hair (I swear he&#x27;s like a giant bear...). this one is fantastic! Get&#x27;s all the hair in all the right places so he can finally go to work and not have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at 8am.. Totally worth every cent!</li>
    <li> looks really good, and i&#x27;m sure it will be useful. i got it for my dad, he will love it</li>
    <li> I like this product and it is an item that I recommended some people buying. This was definitely the site to make the purchase.</li>
    <li> I use it to shave on my way to work while driving. for this it is perfect. battery lasts weeks. still misses a couple hairs though..</li>
    <li> This razor is comfortable to use and easy to clean since it is recommended that it be rinsed under hot water after each use.</li>
    <li> My husband has used a Norelco shaver for 40+ years.  He wanted to replace his old one with one that would charge quickly and  operate with or without the cord. This model fills that requirement and give him a smooth, clean shave.  Fairly easy to clean, too.</li>
    <li> This razor&#x27;s theory is good, but the materials out of which it is made are easily breakable.  Does not give a close shave either.</li>
    <li> I have owned many Norelco shavers and this one is my favorite for sure. It is very light and shaves very close.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor to replace my Remington R5 after I dropped and broke it, and it does not perform as well as I had hope...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positives; it&#x27;s water resistant, has a flip out trimmer, and runs smoothly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it does not cut hair as effectively as the R5</li>
    <li> The Norelco PT730 replaced a Norelco 6423LC. I find  the motor stronger on the PT730 than the 6423LC  Grant it, the 6423LC is many years old, has the original heads  and gives a close shave in 30 minutes where the heads got hot. The PT730 gave me a good shave the very first time I used it after reading the entire manual and charging the battery, per manual. Despite the &amp;#34;shaving tips&amp;#34; listed in the manual, I still got a good shave the first time in just a few minutes. So far, I&#x27;m impressed, especially for the price at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco PT730 Powertouch Electric Razor  Great razor! &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;Meets all my razor needs.&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;7 more words required. 4 more words required.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected and more for a reasonable price.  Only downside is it doesn&#x27;t come with a case, but I had one from my old razor.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really nice and great working razor. Nothing fancy but does do the job that it meant to do.&lt;br /&gt;The only question is how will perform after 6 month.</li>
    <li> Yes, actually shaves close! I have gone back and forth over the decades with electric shavers, then back to razor blades, then try shavers again.  I keep going back to blades because of poor performance and minor skin irritation from shavers. However, this one is very different.  Each time that I went back to shavers in the past, I had to endure a couple of weeks of significant skin irritation until my skin adjusted.  Not so with this shaver!  No irritation at all.  So, I figured that it&#x27;s not shaving close - wrong again!  This shaves so nearly as close as my razor, that the only way I can tell a difference is to shave one side of my face with a blade and the other with the shaver.  And even then, I have to inspect closely!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months now and there is no degradation in the performance.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as some of my other Norelco razors; but considering the much less costliness when compared to the others, it&#x27;s a little better than OK.</li>
    <li> This is still a good razor just wasn&#x27;t getting every whiskers, but thanks for having something for me to try!</li>
    <li> Doing great with it.  Very smooth.  so glad I got itto replace my old one which was just pulling my hairs out of my face.  (not so bright about replacing things when they need replacing!)  and a good price too.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor is because as my age growths, it is becoming increasingly difficult to shave by blade shaver.The razor looks so nice, but more importantly, they works great. Shaving became so easy for me, all the works can be done within a few minutes, love it. I purchased another Philips Norelco AT810 Powertouch with Aquatec Electric Razor for my father, no doubt he will love it too.</li>
    <li> I usually buy the most expensive Norelco I can buy.  This time I bought one of the cheaper models and I think it is just as good as the high priced model.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor for my husband. He had a Norelco razor prior, so I knew he liked the brand. I didn&#x27;t think I could do much harm by purchasing this without his knowledge. So I did, it arrived and my husband was quite surprised. Now, my husband is not the talkative...and thank you...thank you...kinda&#x27; guy. A cowboy of few however meaningful words. This guy had shared with me each and every evening upon returning from work how much he really enjoyed his new razor. So guys...all I can say...this item has exceeded my husbands expectations...and trust me...that says a lot. I would endorse this product on price and quality...and happy husband!!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an old  Norelco that after many years of service it finally stopped. I am surprised how much progress has been made and how much better this one is. Cleaning is a snap and ie gives me a great close shave.</li>
    <li> It gives a very close shave, is very easy to clean, and holds a charge for a long time.  It shaves so close that you have to be gentle or you will end up with skin irritation.  If you have sensitive skin it might not be the best choice.</li>
    <li> I like to keep a shaver in the car and shave while driving.  The old NiCd batteries would lose charge after a few days.  These new ones are really great.  Also nice is the low battery light feature.</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband, and he loves it!  Uses it daily, whereas when using prior electric razor, he tended to get &#x27;fuzzy&#x27; a few days a week.</li>
    <li> Previously I&#x27;ve only owned a Braun bar-type electric razor since 2006 or 2007, so I don&#x27;t have too much to compare it to, but this razor is super!  Compared with the Braun, it&#x27;s quieter, pulls less, shaves closer, and holds a charge longer.  In all other respects it&#x27;s at least as good as the Braun. It doesn&#x27;t take as long to shave, and it handles longer hairs much better.  The light blinks orange when it needs a charge, for a short time after you shut it off.  This shaver was a great upgrade for me.</li>
    <li> We have had to purchase a few razors for my Father in Law over the past 2 years...because he drops them...in this case we were able to attach a lanyard to it....and problem solved....Norelco quality...easy to clean too!</li>
    <li> I studied many reviews on this razor before I decided to order.  True to all reviews our son who turned 49 on his&lt;br /&gt;birthday just loves it.  He says it is the best razor he has ever had.  Nice close shave, he has had no irritation and so easy to clean.  All of that and I might add the prize was right too,</li>
    <li> razor works very well on face but causes irritation on neck area.....it is also irritating that you need more words in my review</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to do. Cleaning it is still a bit of a fuss. Still needd to find out how long it stays sharp.</li>
    <li> He was so pleased!  It was exactly what he had hoped for, and he likes that he can take it with him.</li>
    <li> I purchased this electric razor to see if I would like it.  As far as the razor goes, it is light, quiet and did a good job shaving.  I decided to return the razor for the simple reason, it did not shave as close a razor for me.  I did not like having to shave twice a day to avoid the five o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
    <li> It is very small and seems weak. You need multiple passes to make a &amp;#34;dent &amp;#34; in your beard .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned three electric razors in my life and this is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned and my very first cordless.</li>
    <li> I chose this razor because I was able to get a great deal on it... but it has turned out to be the best electric razor I have ever had!  The battery is super long lasting... I charged it when I first received it over two months ago, use it every day and it still doesn&#x27;t need to be recharged!  It&#x27;s great!  Well worth a look at...</li>
    <li> My thoughts, it&#x27;s loud but seems to give an okay shave.  I wouldn&#x27;t waste a lot of money on it but it seems to do the job.</li>
    <li> This shaver is getting a lot of use - on one charge - and is shaves better that the old model. It took a little breaking in at first, but now it&#x27;s a big hit. I gave it as a present.</li>
    <li> After much deliberation, I decided to try this Phillips Norelco PT730 Razor, if only for the reason that it could be used while plugged in.  Previously I&#x27;d had an inexpensive foil razor from Panasonic that I liked very much, but the foil broke and the replacement costs were more than the razor itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the PT730 to shave my scalp.  I typically shave my head with a regular blade razor, and I&#x27;ve tried any number of disposables and cartridge razors.  Unfortunately, the amount of time it takes to shave my head due to the many curves and corners makes me take a few days off between shaves, which makes it much harder to shave, especially when the hairs clog the razor, or the blade dulls halfway through shaving my head.  The end result is that on more than one occasion I&#x27;ve taken huge chunks of my scalp out with one of these fifty-seven blade monstrosities that Schick and Gillette put out.  You&#x27;ve never known pain until you put a styptic pencil on a gaping wound in your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So bring on the Norelco PT730.  First impressions were a bit shaky.  The razor feels light, and when turned on, it&#x27;s quiet and sounds like it&#x27;s powered by a wind-up engine.  But then I plopped it on my head and started shaving.  In less time than it takes to shave with a three or four bladed razor, I was able to shave two or three days of growth on my scalp down almost as smooth as a regular razor.  I used it on my face, and there were some small razor burns and pulls, but nothing like a previous rotary razor I had a few years back.  The flexible heads do a great job of fitting the contours of the face.  Clean up was easy, just a rinse, a shake, and some time to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have argued the razor feels cheap, and it does appear that the accessories, namely the plug and the protective cover for the blades, are cheaper.  The power cord is a thin cord that looks to be made out of the same wire as a USB cable.  But I was glad to see that Norelco didn&#x27;t coil the cord.  This allows you to use it plugged in at a much further distance from the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot yet speak to charge times or usage time but it seems as though the stated 8 hours charge and 40 minute usage are about right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a bald guy who needs a steady solution to shaving your head, I highly recommend the Norelco PT730.This allows you to use it plugged in at a much further distance from the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot yet speak to charge times or usage time but it seems as though the stated 8 hours charge and 40 minute usage are about right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a bald guy who needs a steady solution to shaving your head, I highly recommend the Norelco PT730.</li>
    <li> Very close shave plus extremely easy to clean, I wish I would have bought many years ago. If you like to shave your head, this electric razor will give you a very close shave in about 5 - 10 minutes without the mess or irritation. Highly recommended...</li>
    <li> This review compares the Philips Norelco PT730 shaver to the Braun Series 1-190 shaver. I suspect that my comments will apply generally to most vibrating-blade shavers (e.g., Braun)  and rotating-blade shavers (e.g., Norelco).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned three of the Braun shavers (essentially identical) over the past six years. It would be very difficult to find a more ergonomic electric shaver. They charge quickly and hold charge a long time. About six months ago, I bought the Norelco shaver. It is not nearly as ergonomic as the Braun and does not charge nearly as fast and probably does not hold a charge as long. But the rotating-blade Norelco shaver is quiet and vibration-free, and its shave is a little closer. The Braun works best when the whiskers are short (best if the growth is no older than two days). The Norelco is better on the longer whiskers. I vacillate between the two shavers depending on my mood, whisker length, and perhaps other subconscious factors. I usually use both shavers to complete one shave. The Braun is best for straight edges like sideburns. My recommendation would be to buy both of these shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the Braun is more ergonomic, I find as time goes by that I&#x27;m using the Norelco shaver more often than the Braun. The Braun shaver has one serious deficiency: The pop-up trimmer on all three of my Braun shavers quit working after a while (I can&#x27;t remember how long they worked). Not having this trimmer at hand is inconvenient, but I can use the pop-up trimmer on the Norelco.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed by the price. It was much lower than other comparable shavers I researched and the quality of the shave it provides is excellent.</li>
    <li> I bought this in April 2012.  It replaced another Norelco shaver which I had for probably close to ten years.  The only reason I replaced the old one was because the batteries in the old one finally gave out and it was not cost effective to have them professionally replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new one has a light on it which switches from green to amber when the batteries are getting low.  I liked this feature.  Also, the new one has lithium batteries which last longer between shaves and are supposed to last longer before needing replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the shaver was completely dead this morning.  Since the batteries were not low when I used it yesterday, I suspected the worse.  Just to be safe, I plugged it in to charge the batteries.  It has been charging for the last six hours.  The light is flashing green to indicate it is charging but when I unplug it, it still does not turn on.  The shaver has a two year warranty so I will probably get a new one but I will still be out the cost of shipping it someplace and my time.</li>
    <li> I thought the lift and cut was a stretch until I tried it and I was amazed at how much better this razor cut over my old one.  I get a good shave every time and am very pleased.</li>
    <li> This shaver works as well as several similar I have had that cost almost 50% more. I was able to use a charging &amp;#34;stand&amp;#34; from an older unit instead of the simple cord and plug that came with it.</li>
    <li> I have had several mid to low end Norelco cordless shavers over the years. They have all been very good. Since new cutters are expensive I use them longer than normal &amp; then look for a good price on a new shaver. The new shaver also has new batteries since they also die after awhile.</li>
    <li> This was my first electric razor and most probably the last one. I used it thrice now and I have rash all over my face. It does not even clean my hair. This shaver absolutely does not cut even small hair ,mainly in the  neck region. I have to go over and over the same area for few minutes and even then it does not give a complete shave. I will stick to my Gillette fusion pro-glide power for now. This one deserves a zero rating. I don&#x27;t know why this one has good ratings.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor. At first I was hesitant to pay less, having had more expensive models. I was using each, with the same blades for a few years on end. After realizing that one year is the best I should expect for blades, there was a need to go to a lower price if possible.  I have soft skin with stubborn facial hairs, especially in the lower chin. The lower part of my neck gets sore quickly.  This model does not have all the trimmers. But I am very satisfied and have bought a second one just to have on hand.  Amazon&#x27;s price is very hard to beat. I found WMT, KMT etc to want at least $25 more.</li>
    <li> There is no need to charge it for several uses, right out of the box. Makes a close shave and super easy to clean out.,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for about two weeks now and it works great. It doesn&#x27;t sound all that powerful but it sure does the job. I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver for fifteen years and had no problem with any kind of shaving rash. I really love the fact that you can rinse  the shaving heads under running water. Makes cleanup a breeze. No cons whatsoever. I actually look forward to shaving now. Great product.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband for Christmas.  He had broken the razor he had and wasn&#x27;t fixing it or even bothering to shave...how gross!!  So now he has a new razor that he loves and is shaving daily!!  Thanks for sending it so promptly!!</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco PT730 Powertouch Electric Razor - Gave it to my husband for Christmas and he&#x27;s still using it. He seems pretty happy with it</li>
    <li> So nice to be back to Norelco!! This product for the price is fantastic. Shaves close, is quiet and comfortable. I wish they would have incorporated a charging stand but for the price you can&#x27;t have it all I guess. I threw out my old Remington as soon as my new razor arrived!!</li>
    <li> The person who received this items it very happy with it.  It was all that it said it was and works great.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers since the early 1950s starting with a single rotary head when I was in college.  They have all been satisfactory but by far the best is a plug-in Noreloc Rotatract Razor that I have had for at least 30 years. It rivals a straight razor for smoothness. I replaced it with one of the early cordless models.  It is my back-up and I don&#x27;t think I have ever changed the heads. This PT730 is my 2nd favorite so far.  It replaces a Norelco  shaver that I used for many years and replaced the batteries at least twice at Batteries Plus.  I gave up on it when the new heads I bought at WalMart proved about as effective as a rough washcloth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect if you want it to leave 70% of the hair and you want to spend 5 times longer shaving than with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;The side burn trimmer actually does a better job than the shaver itself, it&#x27;s a pathetic product.  Do not buy.</li>
    <li> Works well, holds a charge,easy to use.  The shave is clos and quick with little need To go over areas again and again.</li>
    <li> I had been using a Norelco 8150XL for about 7-8 years and had become frustrated by the way it would irritate my neck. This electric razor is much more gentle on my skin as the shaving heads pivot better. The battery takes longer to charge than my old razor (approx 8 hrs vs. 1 hr), but this really isn&#x27;t a big deal to me. Overall, this is a good value in my opinion and well worth the cost to upgrade.</li>
    <li> Always happy with Norelco shavers.</li>
    <li> My husband likes it very much</li>
    <li> Havn&#x27;t received it yet, don&#x27;t know but hope it is better then the last one  and won&#x27;t fall apart.</li>
    <li> My previous shaver was Norelco, lasted over 15 years, the battery finally gave out. This one is great so far. If you just got a Norelco (rotary blades) they have a learning process. Give it a chance.</li>
    <li> This item is one of the best I have seen, it is encased in a metal cover it is just like a mini clippers, one piece with multi comes lengths. fits in your hand nicely easy to use.</li>
    <li> always have been a remington user.  then I tried the norelco and was very impressed.  Gets the longer as well as short hairs, it&#x27;s quiet and gives a very close shave.</li>
    <li> this razor works for me..i recommend it to those with a very light beard..ir if you are the kind that can go a day without shaving..it you have a heavy beard then you need something more substantial...the clipper works again for my goatee and mustash and my very lightly whiskered face...</li>
    <li> Works (cuts) well enough. I had a Norelco rechargeable razor previously, which served me well for more than 40 years.  It would run for six weeks before I had to charge it; the new one gives me about half that many shaves before it must be recharged.  I was also disappointed that the new one did not come with a case to keep it in when I travel.  In short, &amp;#34;They just don&#x27;t make things like they used to!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I selected this unit over some of the other Norelco because I can shave while charging. This unit charges slower than my old unit but that is not an issue for me. I charge it overnight and it is done by morning. This is a nice light unit, much lighter than my older Norelco. I do like the rinse head capibility - it is so easy to clean when I can rinse in warm water after using. My old unit required taking the heads all apart to get a good cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is not good. It works but is way underpowered. I use another unit for beard trimming so it is not a huge issue for me. This would be a 5 star review except for the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, for me, with a light beard, this is a great shaver. Does what it should in very good order. This entire unit was cheaper that a new blade head for my original - go figure.</li>
    <li> Hubby couldn&#x27;t be happier - opened the package right away and charged it right up.  Loves it !!  Great purchase so far.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done in a reasonable amount of time. No problems so far. Would have been nice if it had a display to let you know how much battery life is left rather then a light when it is dead.</li>
    <li> This razor is more powerfule than I thought it would be and the charge lasts.  I get a good close shave with out any irritation.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and thought I would take the chance since it was such a good price.  Boy was I wrong.  This was a total waste of money.  The motor is way too weak.  I literally have to stretch my skin and go over the same area multiple times to cut the hair.  It also causes more ingrown hairs than any electric razor I have had before.  I wish I would have returned it while I still had the chance.</li>
    <li> My wife was looking at reviews on the Consumer&#x27;s Report website and showing me well rated razors on the site. They were in the $200 range and I found this one on Amazon and it works great and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> It works Great and the battery last a long time, and it is very handy to have around and use</li>
    <li> This was a Fathers Day Gift replacing the 15 year old model he had. It is more user friendly. You do not have to wait for the charge just plug in and shave. Or charge and use with out the cord. He is Happy!</li>
    <li> Took a while to Break in, but nice now !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed that this has held up to three years of almost-daily shaving. I may have to replace now because the hinge that keeps the top part on is loose.</li>
    <li> I like the weight, and how it feels while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I hope it will last as long as my old shaver (several years)</li>
    <li> Jim really likes this shaver.</li>
    <li> Great!  Cut my daily shave time in half.</li>
    <li> I love it. I was using a 12 year old Norelco model, and decided it was time for a new one. And was it ever! I love this new one, and it does a much better job in half the time. Don&#x27;t wait for the upgrade any longer, just get a new one.</li>
    <li> Nice razor for good price.  Got it for my teenage son for his first time shaving and it has been working great.</li>
    <li> I expected to have a battery level gauage on this which would show the amount of battery left before re-charge, otherwise OK</li>
    <li> Best razor I have ever had!! I have used a Braun all of my life -- over 30 years of shaving! I just didn&#x27;t know what I was missing!!!</li>
    <li> Short hair and very short hair is not cut - I think the good old razor blade (vibrating or nonvibrating one like the Gilette)  is a better option than this electric razor</li>
    <li> I gave it to my son to review. He&#x27;s had it for a little over a month, and this is what he had to say:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Easy to clean with removable parts that can be easily reassembled.&lt;br /&gt;*Good, clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;*Battery life is slightly below average but not so much that it should discourage someone from purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;*Louder compared to my previous electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;*Corded charger makes it possible to shave while charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He had a Norelco last time, and it lasted over two years until he accidentally dropped it in the toilet. These are typically reliable and long-lasting products.&lt;br /&gt;My husband also uses electric Norelco razors, and his oldest one was 7-8 years old before the battery finally died out. He prefers higher end razors with lift and cut. This does not have lift and cut, but it does a good overall job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on my son&#x27;s positive opinion, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity through Amazon Vine to review two of Norelco&#x27;s mid-range electric shavers - the PT720 and the PT730. At first glance, they seem to be identical except for color and the pop-up trimmer on this one (PT730) and the $10 price difference at this writing. However, upon use I find that there is indeed a difference in the way they shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both shavers allow you to use them corded or cordless and both shavers can be rinsed clean under water. (You could actually use these razors in the shower, but rotary shavers perform better on a dry beard.) Both shavers feature the same, replaceable, flexing heads - which are amazing in their ability to follow the curves of your face while giving you a close shave. Both shavers last about 40 minutes on a single charge and both have an indicator light for battery status.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The differences are that this shaver features Super Lift &amp; Cut (which picks up longer hairs and shaves them smoothly), DualPrecision (which lets you shave even the shortest stubble cleanly), and a pop-up trimmer. The PT720 features Comfort Cut, which gives a gentler shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In trying both on my husband and sons, I found that for my husband, who has a heavy beard, this shaver gave him a closer shave than the PT720 on his 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. For one son, who is in college and shaves infrequently, this shaver picked up the long, scraggly hairs much, much better than the PT720. However, for another son with a heavy beard but very sensitive skin, the PT720 was much more comfortable and he said he would ONLY use that one. I was shocked to see such a big difference because the two shavers really do look identical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pop-up trimmer works great and I like that it is long enough to use without catching your head hair in the razor head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean up is just one press of a button and the head pops open. Then you can rinse the whole thing under the tap! Very easy and convenient. Norelco recommends replacing the head every 12 months for optimum performance. Also included is a little cleaning brush and a plastic head cover to protect the heads between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a mid-priced, electric rotary-style shaver without a lot of whistles and bells, I think you will be pleased with this shaver. If you have extremely sensitive skin, you might want to look at Norelco&#x27;s PT720.head every 12 months for optimum performance. Also included is a little cleaning brush and a plastic head cover to protect the heads between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a mid-priced, electric rotary-style shaver without a lot of whistles and bells, I think you will be pleased with this shaver. If you have extremely sensitive skin, you might want to look at Norelco&#x27;s PT720.</li>
    <li> My husband usually prefers to shave with his razor and the Art of Shaving products.  Sometimes he doesn&#x27;t have time, and I picked this up to speed up his morning routine.  He had an electric razor previously, but thought it didn&#x27;t do a great job.  He loves this one, says it gives him a close shave, and he appreciates that it is much quieter than others he has used.  He also likes washing it off under the running water.  Happy with it.</li>
    <li> This razor has far exceeded all of my expectations!! I couldn’t ask for a better razor. A close shave everytime and easy to clean!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned half a dozen Norelco shavers in the last 20 years. I would still be using the first one, but I no longer live near the place where they will replace the rechargeable battery for about $10, so I&#x27;ve had to buy new ones primarily because of dead batteries. When I started looking this time, I was shocked to see that Norelco has one shaver that it sells for $350! This one, at one-seventh the cost, is probably still overpriced. It has a less powerful motor than my last Norelco, and in order to make it easier for Norelco to sell this razor in every country, this model now includes a brick plug instead of a standard two-prong North American plug, which simply creates more travel bulk. I also am not fond of the way the head flips off so easily because it doesn&#x27;t have as secure a locking system as older models. So, while the razor performs adequately, it&#x27;s not a must-have item. There are better values.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco electric shavers since 1960.  This one works great and I sure like the under the tap washing feature.  The lithium battery seems to give it more power and a longer lasting charge.</li>
    <li> 12/2013 - I bought this as a replacement for a similar P-N rather than replacing its blades.After about a month of use, it seems  very similar to the unit it replaced, so my review will be the same.  Note that this unit cost more BUT the old one (Philips Norelco 7310 Men&#x27;s Shaving System ) now shows on Amazon as a different model number(Philips Consumer Lifestyle 7310XL/17 Men&#x27;s Cord/Cordless Electric Shaver)  at a much higher price than I paid then or this model.  I&#x27;m sure there is an explanation for this ... maybe it is an &amp;#34;improved model&amp;#34; now(?) but it is more than I want to spend.  So here is the essence of my previous review which applies to this new unit, with an added update/comment at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used electric shavers for many years. I looked for a reasonably priced, competent shaver. This is one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shaves and trims well. It holds a charge long enough to be useful. It runs fine when plugged in, the plug is even small and light. I have only used it a few months so can&#x27;t comment on long term battery or other durability. It is easily cleaned, allowing use of water. It light weight with nice balance and feel when in use. Simple to use, there are no cutting height or other adjustments but, because it is a basic shaver, others may be do some jobs better such as: extremely long/tough beards; special skin; or shaving exceptionally close. I don&#x27;t need any of these so it is no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not fancy or loaded with &#x27;stuff&#x27;. It just does its job. All in all a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/2013 - I glanced at a couple other reviews of similar P-N shavers and see others seem to agree with me. It looks like P-N uses  the old &#x27;Gillette business model&#x27; ...now also used in the printer business and probably plenty others...which is to sell the initial product at a low price and make the big money on replacement parts. Not that there is anything wrong with that...but in the printer case, one can purchase replacement ink/toner from different suppliers, rather than only the original manufacturer...so the Gillette model may be better for electric shavers than printers :-) ... but I depress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see others, as I, recommend throwing the old unit away or keeping it as a backup for a while then throwing it away...and replacing it rather than buying replacement parts. This is essentially what I did, but paid more for a similar/nearly identical new shaver. I managed to stretch its life to about 4 years at the expense of some rough shaves, good value for the $29.95 I spent in 2009.  YMMV...</li>
    <li> As a lifelong Norelco electric razor user, my husband says that the Norelco PT730 Rechargeable Cordless/Cord Tripleheader Razor is one of the best he has ever used. Some may say that an electric razor does not shave as close as shaving with a manual blade razor and shaving cream. Some may enjoy the ritual that goes along with manual shaving. I think most men are mistaken. The Norelco PT730 gives an incredibly close and comfortable shave, easily matching the results of a wet razor shave. (As a wife, I can feel it, too!) He hated the mess of shaving cream and gel, constantly replacing dull razors and walking out of the bathroom with tiny bits of tissue covering a cut or two. (Not sexy!) Even the best manual shavers will cut skin occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that impressed me about this razor is the sleek, ergonomic design. It feels good in your hand. It was also charged out of the box, which was unexpected. My husband tried it immediately, and said the shave rivaled his blade experiences--very close, very smooth. The pivoting/floating blade heads create an even and stubble-free shave, and the trimmer makes trimming the sideburns and moustache a breeze. Just run the razor under water to clean. It does not get easier than this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen the evolution of electric razors over the decades and cannot believe the progress that has been made. At one time, electric razors could not compete with the close shave a wet manual razor gave, but times have changed. The Norelco PT730 Rechargeable Cordless/Cord Tripleheader Razor is more than a convenience. There&#x27;s no mess, no fuss, no blades to replace, and no cuts (or necessary tissue). Both your mirror and your mate will love you for it.</li>
    <li> Having been away from electrics for some time, I bought this mostly for the convenience.  Quiet, close and smooth shave, great battery life.  A very good value In my opinion.  Haven&#x27;t used the blade since getting this.  Replaced an old Braun Foil shaver and feel this does a better job with half the effort and noise.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers for years. This one is really good.  It gives a close, smooth shave. I like the trimmer for doing neck hair and mustache hair. You can pop open the head and rinse it out to clean it.  That&#x27;s very easy.  Another thing I like is that this just comes with the shaver and recharger. There is not any stuff in the package that I just throw away (like a desktop recharge stand).</li>
    <li> VERY QUIET. WAS USED TO MY OLD RAZOR THAT I WAS TEMPTED TO USE EAR PLUGS. HAVE ONLY HAD FOR SEVERAL DAYS BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I&#x27;VE CHARGED IT. DOES NOT PULL AT HAIR AND THE TRIMMER WORKS WELL. ALSO VERY LITE.CLEANS WELL UNDER RUNNING WATER.IBITY IBITY THATS ALL FOLKS!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my son and asked him for his opinion on it. He said he likes it and that it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But keep in mind that he is 16 and has like 5 whiskers on his face lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely holds a charge for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He likes this razor better than the other 2 I had previously given him which were the Panasonic ES-LV81-K Arc 5 Multi Flex Wet/Dry Nanotech Rechargeable Shaver with Vortex Cleaning System and the Braun Cruzer 5 Body Cruzer, 5 Body Shaver.</li>
    <li> Just like the title said I took the trimmer to a full beard and then the electric razor to it and it worked fine. The detractors with the one star reviews have their opinion. I did take the head apart and and the blades were not the lift and separate version of some of the more expensive versions that I have had in the past. I did notice the screen between the blade and the skin is designed in a new fashion better than the old models. When the battery gets low the light flashes green and red and the battery isn&#x27;t run all the way out and I like that.</li>
    <li> This razor was given as a gift to a family member and has been doing a great job for a few months now.  All the feedback about the unit has been good.</li>
    <li> I am rather disappointed in this shaver.  It is very slow and extremely noisy.  I would not recommend this one for a seasoned beard.</li>
    <li> this might not have as many bells and whistles as its counter part but its just as good for its intended usage. it shaves just like another ravor hold a good charge this only thing is that this unit tends to create a little more irritation. norelco is the only one that i have trusted for years.</li>
    <li> Have used Philishave/Norelco for 40&#x27;odd years, and needed a shaver for travel, without the hassle of carrying a charging stand around with me -- This model saves a lot of space with its direct plug in lead. The motor appears to be a little slower than my other Norelco&#x27;s - perhaps because of the lower cost.  Works fine, and better than my single bladed Philishave of 40 years ago</li>
    <li> This shaver apparently works great on older person&#x27;s skin. My mom uses it to shave my Dad who needs help grooming. She loves it as shaving with a razor was getting too hard on older skin. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars just because I don&#x27;t have any other experience to compare it to.</li>
    <li> good shave, comfortable to use, easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would like to be able to use with cord also, but unable</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my husband, and he loved it. the shave is not very deep with that shaver but it&#x27;s okay, he like and I too !!!</li>
    <li> cool razor, low weight, VERY QUIET!!!, shaves sufficiently clear and does not irritate the skin. Recommended, especially for such a \\&quot;good\\&quot; price ;-)</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my father and he said it doesn&#x27;t give a close shave.  It works great and is easy to use and charge but it seems that you may need to go over the area you are cutting to make sure you get a close shave.</li>
    <li> Fantastic shaver for a good price. I just dislike that it has a bulky power supply whereas all my previous shavers had just a standard cable, and the charging unit was internal.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement for my trusty 10-year-old Norelco. I was able to get an extra two years of life out of my old Norelco after it&#x27;s batter died because it was both corded and cordless, so corded + cordless operation was a requirement for me. I also wanted something functionally similar to my old Norelco because it worked so well. This fit the bill. It gave a good close shave out of the box, is a lot quieter than my old razor, and can be cleaned by running under water - very nice.</li>
    <li> sadf sdfk sdf sdf s df sdf as fwef we fe g fdg  gh dfg df gd fg dfg dfg&lt;br /&gt;Done!</li>
    <li> Not perfect but very capable. The pop-up trimmer can be annoying where you can only use it at certain angles or with certain pressure so it doesn&#x27;t fall back down into it&#x27;s non-popped-up state. Overall though I haven&#x27;t really had any problems with it other than the minor grips about the pop-up trimmer.</li>
    <li> This razor gives a quick, comfortable shave for my heavier than average beard.  It holds the charge well over several days.</li>
    <li> One of the best razors ever! Received a day ahead of schedule. Would recommend this to everyone. Best deal I found on the internet.</li>
    <li> I like it, it was a little bit slower than my previous razor but it is much safer, because it doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin, shaves really soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have to use electric now, it works fine</li>
    <li> have always used norelco ..this one seems to run a little slower than previous models. So it seems to me, it takes a  little longer to complete ....surprising as the price goes up , the quality goes down..maybe it needs to break in???</li>
    <li> Works fine.  Use it daily.  No problems thus far -- few months.</li>
    <li> could shave better, but O.K.</li>
    <li> I would never get another razor like this one. It has never provided a close shave or a good shave even for that matter.  I do not recommend this razor for anyone.  This razor lays around on my dressing counter and is plugged in every once in a while to keep the battery charged.  I have never had a shave that was totally done by this razor.  I have had Norelco razors before and liked them but not this one.</li>
    <li> Great shaver-- Still using it and going strong and it has been 6 months. Give it about 2 weeks to break in, the first week is a little tough.</li>
    <li> Does a great job. Love it.</li>
    <li> Good. Like it. Would buy again. QED</li>
    <li> Was really looking for a corded razor, but evidential they no longer make them. Just like all other \\&quot;cordless\\&quot; razors, this one too is lacking in power.</li>
    <li> I have a thick and heavy beard and it works, I had an old shaver, this one is so much lighter and quieter and easy to clean, thanks.</li>
    <li> This Norelco replaced a 7 year old similar model. The main improvement is a much better, if unspecified type, rechargeable battery. It gives many more shaves before needing a recharge than it&#x27;s predecessor. The LED indicator is also much better at warning that a recharge will be needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many more expensive models offered by Norelco, but i fail to see any useful additional benefits.</li>
    <li> Shaver seems well made, and provides a close, comfortable shave. The battery life seems to be especially good, with many shaves between charges.</li>
    <li> Razor charged quickly.  Have been using it for about three weeks.  Gives a clean shave.  Pop up trimmer is adequate.  Fits well in my hand.</li>
    <li> The shipment came on approximate date as indicated.  Your skin takes a little bit to get use to the razor but it trims whiskers fairly smoothly and has a quiet motor in it.  Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> The price is really perfect as a gift for my father and father-in-law. It&#x27;s easier to use for them. I will buy another if I need it next time!!!</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THE PHILIPS NORELCO ELECTRIC RAZOR  PT730/41,AND I FIND IT GIVES A GOOD SHAVE.  THE WAY THE HEAD IS IT GIVES A CLOSE SHAVE, BETTER THAN SOME OF THE OTHERS ,AND I HAD MANY .  THE BLADES ARE VERY EASY TO REPLACE  ON THIS MACHINE.  I LIKE THE PHILIPS NORELCO PT730/41 ELECTRIC RAZOR FOR ITS FAST BATTERY CHARGING ,AND ITS  CONVIENCE.  A.A.D.  CAMBRIDGE,MA,.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how smooth and quiet it is.  It does an incredible job and shaves very closely.  I like the fact that you can rinse it under a faucette. It holds a charge for a long time.  I really like it and would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have never had any other shaver except a Norelco. This one works well and shaves close and the battery charge last for a long time. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered promptly and works well. On/off button is very sensitive and can accitentally be turned on in luggage when it rubs against something else.</li>
    <li> Have used Norelco rotary for 30 yrs. or so.  My previous one broke after 10 yrs. of use. Had a used other brand rotory that was not as good, so looked for replacement.  Tryied Braun-3 for a few months, but not as close or quick as previous Norelco&#x27;s.  Picked this one up on sale and am glad I did.  At the price I paid, it dosn&#x27;t have to last more than a few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun works better for lower neck and with 2-3 or so days of growth.  Not as close shaved and takes longer to use, and harder to do the \\&quot;edges\\&quot; of my face. I am keeping it though, for these functions. It is more confortable on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 730 Norelco has the better heads on it and is a must have, so concidered it the lowest cost option for me. Except for the Neck irritation (especially with longer hairs... seems like the old \\&quot;lift and cut\\&quot; becomes \\&quot;snag and rip\\&quot; in that situation), think it&#x27;s the best electric low cost option.</li>
    <li> It looks good. I will give it to my father as a Christmas gift. I hope he will like it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to shave my head and I love it. Shaves close and smooth with no irritation and no chance of nicks or cuts on scalp. Cleanup is easy. Cord length on charger is adequate when corded shave is needed. The price was below other vendors I checked and the 2 1/2 year warrantee shows manufacturer confidence in this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not understand the negative reviews for this shaver, especially the ones where the writers insist this product cuts skin, pulls hair, or will not cut hair of differing lengths. Perhaps these people are confused and writing reviews for a weed eater or a chainsaw. Or maybe they just love to post bogus reviews for products they do not actually own, misuse, or not know how to operate and maintain properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use a double-edge razor, an Edwin Jagger, to shave my head and trim the edges of my beard. The job this PT730 does on my head is equally close, but without the possibility of razor burn, nicks, and cuts. I still use the Edwin Jagger to trim the edges of my beard and totally enjoy the balance, feel, and cut of this double-edge razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am age 60 and shave with a double edge since age 9. Yeah, I am a Sasquatch when it comes to body hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 01/22/2014: Let my wife borrow shaver to test on her legs. She loves it and is no longer using blade shavers. No more cuts, nicks, and and smooth skin.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace my husband&#x27;s other electric razor. He just loves it. Smooth shave. No pulling or tugging. Its a Norelco.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco cordless shavers over 20 years. very well made product. shaves good</li>
    <li> Hi bought it for my brother as a gift, working fine good price have used Norelco products before easy to use</li>
    <li> It shaves closely and it will trim the sideburns too.  It will give you the versatility to touch up when you need it before you step out after work.  I only wished that it came with a travel bag.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver.  Easy to use.  Easy to Clean.  And, gives a darn good shave.</li>
    <li> Please do not waste your money. I have used this shave for 6 months and have never liked it because it is a very weak shaver. I am an average beard, but I have to go over and over my beard 10-20 times to get all the hair removed by then my face is raw. I am looking to buy a better shave maybe (panasonic or braun) not a Norelco.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my son for xmas and he absolutely loves it. Would get another when my husband need a new one.</li>
    <li> My husband is very impressed with Model #PT730. He says that using an electric shaver won&#x27;t give you that close shave you get with a blade, but says this is as close as you can expect and seems to enjoy the convience of its use. Price point was good and it arrived ahead of promised date. Vey happy.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Willow</li>
    <li> Purchased the PT730 because it was almost identical to my existing Norelco I&#x27;ve been using for 10 years.  Have found it to cut much cleaner and faster than my existing razor.  The pop-up trimmer also works well and trims neatly.  Being able to flush it with water also is a nice feature as I&#x27;ve not had to disassemble it to brush clean it as of yet.  Battery has been lasting well and have only charged it once.  Have to read further regarding the red &amp; green lights indicating charge status.  I&#x27;m not sure what I should be watching/listening for as to when it require a charge.  So far a good buy for the money!!</li>
    <li> This razor gives a really close shave except for certain areas on the neck. It will provide shaves for about a week before it needs recharging. My main complaint is that the floating heads and retaining assembly fall out when rinsing it after use. it initially did not have this problem but developed it after several weeks.</li>
    <li> Got for my husband for Christmas.  He uses it everyday and really likes it.  He always ask for a Philips Norelco to replace one that is older.</li>
    <li> i am absolutely delighted with the shaver it gives me the best shave i have had in years</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor as a Christimas present for my husband. He uses it daily and absolutely loves it. For one thing, since it was charged in December, he hasn&#x27;t had to re-charge it yet. Also, it provides a low shave and no irritation. Overall, he is pleased and so am I.</li>
    <li> I love it,It&#x60;very cheaper than our our country&lt;br /&gt;Better:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- 40 minutes run time (vs 30 minutes)&lt;br /&gt;- Slightly quieter - sound is a little deeper&lt;br /&gt;- Charging light blinks while charging (instead of blinking when done charging).</li>
    <li> Price was reasonable.  Quiet operation.  Cuts good.  Battery lasts almost 2 weeks.  Need to clean often if you have somewhat oily skin since it prevents the blades from spinning well.</li>
    <li> awesome product, no hassle, although i was thinking it was the AQUATECH kind STILL LOVE THIS RAZOR!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Very reasonable product. My friend have used this shavor for about 1 month now. Everything goes well.&lt;br /&gt;This meets our needs.</li>
    <li> Bought this model because of the increased battery capacity and indicator light for low charge.  With my previous model I didn&#x27;t know the battery was low until it quit.  I need to use it cordless and plugging it in to finish is not for me.</li>
    <li> I had not used a rotary razor for years. I&#x27;ve been using foil razors and blades. So was a little nervous this product would do as well. It does. I am pleasantly surprised at the closeness of the shave. It is much quieter than my foil razors which was another pleasant surprise. If I don&#x27;t shave for a few days (like over a long weekend), this razor handles it well whereas with the foil razors I found I had to switch to a blade razor to handle the extra stubble. So that was a third pleasant surprise.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver.  It is a very close shave and is very easy to maintain and use.  I wouldn&#x27;t let your hair get too long (maybe a week or so) because it can hurt in some places as you shave (I have pretty coarse facial hair though, and a lot).  It is also very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend this product to anyone as I use it all the time and have no issues with it at all.</li>
    <li> Did this really shave my face? It went so fast and was so quiet that I almost thought that maybe the battery was drained. My previous Norelco shaver of 20 years sounded like a cranky old gas powered buzz saw that required several passes to get the job done. The whine and din nearly made me deaf. The new shaver purrs in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a very close shave and almost feels like I did it with a razor in places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WATCH OUT for the PT720. Costs the same often and does not have the sideburn trimmer. There&#x27;s a $249 shaver out there and how ridiculous and shameful is that for something that goes \\&quot;bzzzzzzzz\\&quot; and removes stuble?</li>
    <li> Excellent quality Very close shave and no side efects like pinching Very easy to clean and maintain.very easy to operate</li>
    <li> but it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as i&#x27;d like. i&#x27;ve had it a couple of months hoping it would &#x27;break in&#x27; but so far not yet. its not bad, just wish it shaved a little closer.</li>
    <li> I bought it because the price is appealing. It is for my dad. But it seems not so powerful compare to other razors of my fathers&#x27;.</li>
    <li> This is my third Norelco razor. All  have been great, but this one is the best one. I recommend it to anyone needing a good electric razor.</li>
    <li> Being a lather and blade man I purchaswd the norellco for a short hospital stay. Before entering the hosp. I tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;After learning not to bear down on my skin, I found a close and easy shaving experience. For those in between days I highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband at his request.  He loves this razor, it really does the job for him.  I like it because it is quiet, I hardly hear it when he is shaving.  We both highly recommend this for a good,dependable razor at a good price...</li>
    <li> I purchased one on Black Friday / Cyber Monday at a reasonable price. I have very sensitive skin so it gave me little white bumps after use. My step father tried it and LOVES it so I gave it to him. A few months later I ordered one for a friend and he LOVES it too. So as I said, its great BUT not for me. It is a good buy.</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with this razor because it&#x27;s rechargeable and I just like having the power of PC oppose two batteries.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and I must say that it works really well.  It took a little while for me to adjust to it but I&#x27;m very happy with it.  After you shave you just flip up the bottom and a head opens up a name change and you can dump the shavings and the trash.  My old one was kind of a pain you had two to head off and sometimes the plates would fall out while you are emptying it.  I would recommend this razor and I would replace it with the same model if it was broken.</li>
    <li> I shave my face and head</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat for the price!  I don&#x27;t have a thick beard though...</li>
    <li> Outstanding shave.  Not as close as a blade, but good enough for most everyday use and situations.</li>
    <li> I love it. Really comfortable and clean shave. A bit expensive.</li>
    <li> Closeness of shave dropped off dramatically within 6-8 months and it took 15-20 minutes and many times over trouble areas to get it smooth....razor completely died within 11 months of purchase.</li>
    <li> this was a gift and he loves it</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver I have ever used.  Shaves nearly as close as a blade.  I highly recommend this.  Easy quick clean with a can of compressed air.  A couple of quick shots of air from the can every two or three days, while held over the shower floor and I am good to go.</li>
    <li> This thing holds a great charge and seems to cut a bit closer than my previous Norelco. I&#x27;m very pleased with the value of this reasonably priced shaver.</li>
    <li> Very good present for my father</li>
    <li> Good shaver.  Does the job....</li>
    <li> I have owned this product for about a year and have never had any problems with it. The shave is decent, but you&#x27;re never gonna be able to get as close as actual razor blades. Battery Life is pretty good considering I leave it for extended periods without use and it still holds the charge. I&#x27;ve gotten the most use out of the bear trimmer.</li>
    <li> I tried this razor straight out of the box after reading the negative reviews, hoping to get an idea of the motor speed before charging. Then I let it charge overnight and tried it again, and there was no change in speed. The blades spin so slowly they are basically scraping bits off the hairs... I noticed very little difference in stubble after I shaved with it. The trimmer pop-out works, but so do scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PASS. RUN AWAY, farrr away. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Item meets all my needs and very compact. Charge last long so no complaints. Very happy with this purchase. Great item</li>
    <li> I used it for a few weeks and was pretty satisfied with the closeness of the shave (not as close as a regular razor mind you). However, I expected it to be quicker to do, but it was not. It took more time and was equally if not more irritating on my skin. I ended up returning it and signing up for dollar shave club.</li>
    <li> I have been a blade man for years but always had an electric as a back up.  This razor does a good job, it is easy to clean, and much quieter than my last razor.  It re-charges very quickly and the charge has lasted through several long weekends away.</li>
    <li> I fixed the old one for years and years I am glad I waited for this is the best ever.Thank you for your quick shipment.&lt;br /&gt;I received it quickly,and put it to work just as soon as the battery was fully charged. Thanks again  Frank</li>
    <li> I gave this to my dad because he was having a hard time using a razor. He said it works fine and that he likes it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use similar Norelco shavers for about 30 years or longer.  All have done a good job for me, but I&#x27;m a red head, which have finer hairs, and I have a lighter beard.  A  heavy black haired person which have thicker hairs and heavier beards, usually do not use electric razors because they cause discomfort shaving and don&#x27;t do as well of a job.  Fast growing beards will probably require shaving twice a day as they do not shave as close as a razor blade.  As compared to other electrics razors I&#x27;ve used, the triple head is great for me.</li>
    <li> Very good product, was expected!</li>
    <li> Gift for dad, and he loves it!</li>
    <li> This shaver does not have the power it should have, not happy with it.</li>
    <li> Great Razor. Terrific for tough and light bears alike. Battery last a long time between charges and blades to dot have to be changed any earlier than others and in fact, they last longer than the previous Norelco&#x27;s we have had.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my husband. He loves it. It is easy to use and is great that you can use it cordless or corded. The attachments are easy to use also. It is self sharpening which I have found to be hard to find in a small clipper, unless you want to pay professional prices.</li>
    <li> takes much longer time than an actual razor, and also burns more skin than actual razor shave.</li>
    <li> Smooth shave with no break in time needed in my case. Very quiet, easy to clean.</li>
    <li> UPDATE after 1.2 yrs of use: heads completely worn out.  Won&#x27;t cut at all.  Motor still good, but entire head assembly must be replaced.  PS - head &amp;#34;eats&amp;#34; and holds cotton fuzz/strands (from a towel), which may be stuck in your wiskers.  Sounds like a joke, but it&#x27;s not.  They &amp;#34;clog&amp;#34; up the entire cutter head, making it almost non-functioning.  A problem I never expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRIOR REVIEW:  Best $50 razor I&#x27;ve bought in years.  Cuts almost as close as a Braun, and plenty close enough for everyday use.  Never knicks me.  And it holds a charge like crazy.  My beard is average, and I can cut every morning for 5 - 7 days on one charge.  Overall, very satisfied with the product.  Perfect balance of performance, and ease of use.  I used to be a huge Braun fan, but I&#x27;m now sold on this particular Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;PS - motor is Not overpowered.  Almost underpowered, but in fact it has just enough power to get through an average beard with no problems at all.  So far (4 weeks of use) I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s the perfect amount of power for normal, everyday use.  If you have barbed wire for a beard, then Maybe you&#x27;d want to look for a stronger motor.  All &amp;#34;normal beard&amp;#34; guys, this will work fine for you.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I found the Norelco PT730/41 satisfactory considering the price!</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and mostly are in multiple directions. This shaver gives me a really close shave. I was amazed with the performance the first time I used it. I would recommend it for people who shave in 3-4 days and have really thick hair.</li>
    <li> This shaver is quiet and comfortable.  The motor hardly seems like it&#x27;s running, as if it were about to run out of charge.  But as the add says, one charge is good for about an hour of shaving, and the shave is good.</li>
    <li> I got this razor for Christmas. I picked it out myself. This is a great razor light weight, very quiet.&lt;br /&gt;It hold a charge for a long time. I like how you rinse the blades after you shave. No brush needed to clean.&lt;br /&gt;I get a  very close shave. No razor burns. I do not have a real thick beard. But I do have to shave each day if I don&#x27;t want to look unshaved.&lt;br /&gt;I have used electric razors over 20 years. And this is my first Norelco and this is a good razor.</li>
    <li> I have always liked Norelco shavers and have bought them and enjoyed them in the past.  However, this was a little different.  First;  if I had known that it was made in China I would not have purchased it.  Second I try not to buy battery backed electric appliances because it is so difficult to dispose of the batteries.  In spite of those considerations I would have kept it once I received it but when I was unable to open the plastic covering I got so disgusted that I just returned it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my dad when I found out he was still shaving with a safety razor despite being blind for over ten years. He loves it! And I feel better knowing he won&#x27;t cut his face any more.</li>
    <li> As a senior citizen I&#x27;ve followed the tried and true method of shaving for a long time. I did own a &amp;#34;electric razor&amp;#34; about 35 years ago, for a very short time. Well, as we age, the body begins to fall apart, yada, yada, and if you&#x27;re of the age, you get my drift. It had begun taking me awhile to shave with my razor because I had to use both hands to steady myself. I ordered this razor just to see if it would help me. Man, was I ever surprised. It shaves me in half the time, is a breeze to clean, just put under the water, let it dry, and move on. It is truly a wonder to me.&lt;br /&gt;So, if you have a few things melting down, are getting older, and want a break from the razor of yesteryear then this is for you. It&#x27;s also great for traveling!</li>
    <li> Really nice shaver. Holds a charge forever also. Its strange shape makes it a bit of a problem to place in the cabinet, but it does fit your hand nicely while shaving. It would be nice if the charger had a &amp;#34;though&amp;#34; type plug also, but this is really nit-picking.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find cutters for my almost 20 year old Norelco, so this is a replacement.  Typical Philips/Norelco performance--  a great shave, easy on your skin.  And being able to rinse in water to clean is a plus.  I got this model because it was the lowest priced model with a sideburn trimmer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor for my 2 teenaged boys, who are just beginning to shave. I selected this model in part because of its relatively inexpensive price, but also because it has a pop-up trimmer (a necessity, in my view, and I&#x27;m not sure why all electric razors don&#x27;t have this feature). The Powertouch has performed very well for them. I have used it on occasion -- I also have a higher-end model Norelco razor. It&#x27;s my perception that the Powertouch razor purchased for my sons doesn&#x27;t provide quite as close a shave on my beard, although it still gets the job done. So if your beard isn&#x27;t particularly heavy, or if you&#x27;re looking for a second &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; razor, I think this would be a good choice. If you have a heavy beard, are looking for a primary</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for his birthday, and he uses it every day. He likes the even-ness and smoothness of the shave.</li>
    <li> This shaver works great, gives many, many shaves before having to re-charge. A $200 razor can&#x27;t do any better, as it also gives a nice close shave!  You can&#x27;t go wrong for the price too. Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> There are a crazy number of razors available.  Replacement blades for my old razor are no longer made (also a Norelco).  So, I ordered this one as it seemed it had enough features and the price was reasonable.  It is lighter than older razor, but has enough power to get job done.  Takes a few shavings for the blades to get set, but the new sharp blades make a big difference.  The charge lasts a long time.  Don&#x27;t need to bring charger if going out of town for a week, just make sure fully charged at start.  I also checked to make sure replacement blades are available and affordable.</li>
    <li> Works great. Holds a charge. Close shave. Great for quality and the price.</li>
    <li> The best electric razor. Charge it and it will shave the toughest of facial hair. This was bought as a gift for elderly father in law and he uses with ease.</li>
    <li> I am one of those unfortunate people with skin that is easily irritated by shaving... I have tried many razors over the years but I am absolutely a huge fan of Norelco products. They perform well, follow the contour of my 57 year old face and do NOT leave me with razor burn.  This razor gave me an EXCELLENT shave in minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!!!</li>
    <li> My first Norelco lasted 12 years before the battery was just too weak to hold a charge so I hope this one is at least half as good. I never replaced the blades and after 12 years the razor was still sharp enough to do the job but I don&#x27;t have a thick beard. So far so good, it sounds weaker than the old model I had but I find it does just as good a job so perhaps it is just quieter. I&#x27;m very happy with it so far and I wouldn&#x27;t buy another brand. There are cheaper Norelco models and someone gave me one as a gift but it doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to this model. Great razor for the money!</li>
    <li> I had a very old Phillips Norelco which finally stopped working and the product works much better with a closer shave.  especially like to be able to rinse the head off under water after each use; great improvement!</li>
    <li> I had My struggles with this because I&#x27;m not really familiar with electronic shavers but after a while I was really happy about getting one because shaving has never been so easy and I don&#x27;t bleed no more in my life now! haha!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for a gift.  He charged it immediately and had used it the next day.  Very close shave almost like a razor.  Was happy with the purchase and the fact it came with the head protector and brush.  Even though he wanted a different brand at first, I think he was quite impressed with this and the price was well below what I saw in stores and online at other sites.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Cuts better than my older Norelco cord razor. Hesitant to clean it in water as advertised.</li>
    <li> This is a well made razor---I researched it and it gives a smooth shave.  It holds a charge and recharges very fast.</li>
    <li> It is a good shaver, however I wish the head was more stable during cleaning. When I knock it against my wastebasket,the head comes off fairly easily.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco for years and love the shave I get. This product is no different, it gives a nice clean shave.</li>
    <li> I have never owned an electric razor.  I tried my dad&#x27;s and I tried my son&#x27;s--I hated them.  I got this for a touch up on off days or for evening out.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the results.  My off day shave was better than my main stream days--and it was faster.  So I admitted I have very little experience with electric razors but can&#x27;t imagine a better one at this price.</li>
    <li> My husband said he liked it a lot.  Nice shave, close shave with out pulling or scrapping his skin.  :0)</li>
    <li> I have used this razor for over one year.  I have tried to use electric razors in the past but have abandon them after a while.  I am still happy with this one.  Make sure that you change the blades once a year like it recommends.  It was like I had bought a new razor.  It is well worth the money.  The battery seems to be holding its charge as well as it did new.</li>
    <li> Gift for husband. Says it works well and shaves closely. Easy to clean and charge. Would recommend purchase. Purchased based on research and reviews.</li>
    <li> My husband needed it badly.  He hasn&#x27;t begun to use it but is still looking at it.  Can&#x27;t say more about how it works!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver. We&#x27;ve had this style before and glad we bought it again.&lt;br /&gt;Close shave and easy to handle.</li>
    <li> It has every thing that I expected. I have been a user of Norelco chargeable shavers since 1978, and have found them most reliable. The reason, I cut short one star is its long charging time. Takes 8 hours for full charging, that is too long as compared to any  shaver that I have previously used. The promo claimed 14 shaves with one full charge, I have never been able to get more than 8.</li>
    <li> This has performed exactly as advertised.  I have no complaints at all.  If there is a down side, it is just a bit noisy.</li>
    <li> I read many of the reviews before purchasing. I have used my razor for over a month and love it.  I noticed the shave is much closer than my last Norelco I purchased which was of a similar cost. It does a great job of shaving close just under the nose area. May be light but does not feel cheap to me.  My son is looking for an electric razor &amp; I recommended this one to him.</li>
    <li> A good electric razor for the price but could of had no slip grips on each side to make it easier to hold in hand plus wish it had a recoil cord for the charger.  The electric cord is in the way when recharging razor</li>
    <li> Shaver works very well as expected as this is the third Norelco shaver I have purchased over many years. Initially I did not want a battery unit but this one holds a charge for a very long time which makes it very convenient to use.  Also the shaving head can be rinsed under the faucet for cleaning.</li>
    <li> I liked this razor from the first day. I bought it to replace my old Norelco which was a plug in and simply did not work in the bathroom of the apartment I moved into. Plus, I wanted to treat myself to a new razor and Norelco was my first choice. This model is not terribly expensive and provides a very smooth shave with almost no irritation. It cleans up easily and fits nicely into your hand. I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This shaves just as well as my 30 year old inherited Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;Like some reviews have stated, the motor sounds weak like the battery is dying, this is just better motor design.&lt;br /&gt;I charge it once every 2 weeks, and have not had any problems with a  dead battery.&lt;br /&gt;Despite its low cost it has been an excellent razor.</li>
    <li> My autistic son wanted a new razor - he read the reviews and chose this one.  It was a good choice for him.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for a travel only use.  I was disappointed in the cheap appearance and sound of the shave when it arrived.  Nonetheless I took the shaver and charger on business trips for most of a year.  After 11 months of part time use it failed to start.  Extended charging did not help&amp;#62; This is such a disappointment after my previous wonderful Norelco shavers.  This one is a cheap piece of junk.  Avoid it!</li>
    <li> Very reliable&lt;br /&gt;Good close shave&lt;br /&gt;Reasonable price&lt;br /&gt;Holds a charge for a long time&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;I like it!!</li>
    <li> Nothing fancy, but does the job. Light, handles my not especially heavy beard easily enough. Battery holds charge well so far.</li>
    <li> After using it for about a week my beard got used to it &amp; is giving me a close shave. Good bang for the buck.</li>
    <li> Good razor for the price.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it. Works well and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; hair like others he said.</li>
    <li> does the job, and it&#x27;s easy to maintain</li>
    <li> It works shaves close with no hastle.  Battery life is very good.</li>
    <li> it won&#x27;t hold a charge for very long, it does not give a close shave and is all around useless</li>
    <li> I had been using a Norelco razor for many years, but it finally died. This new model is lighter weight, the head conforms to my face better and the shave is smoother. And, did I mention, it cost way less that my old Norelco. It is a winner!</li>
    <li> The razor did not perform very well at first. I expected this since it was stated by other reviewers that it would take a few weeks to break in. Now after 3 weeks it cuts much better and I am satisfied with it but I must say that a good razor blade will still do a better job.</li>
    <li> Great razor..this is my third one... would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned.  I had used them occasionally in the past but found them to be loud and they tug at the hair on your face which hurts a little and is irritating.  The first thing I noticed about this particular shaver was how quiet it was.  Very little noise at all.  It gives me a really close shave and doesn&#x27;t hurt even the slightest bit.  I have found that it works best if my face has been recently washed and is dry.  After I&#x27;m done shaving, I can&#x27;t feel stubble at all.  Ergonomics and weight are good and it seems to be easy to clean.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Shaves closely.  Probably best shave from a Norelco I&#x27;ve ever had.  Price is very reasonable.  Only drawback is that it does not come with it&#x27;s own soft case.</li>
    <li> smooth shave, the battery charger is wall mounted like the cell phones so it makes the shaver much lighter than the old models, but as for as the cut, the head design is much better, for a comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> got this for my son. he picked mainly because the top can be rinsed out with water. also because it was cordless. he has had this for a few months now.  he likes the way it shaves and the trimmer on it.  no complaints. would recommend this to anyone needing a good electric razor.</li>
    <li> I had an old Norelco for 12 years that finally died. I bought this hoping that Phillips hadn&#x27;t cheapened it since then. I have to say that I was more then pleasantly surprised. The construction is solid... it gives me a close shave without irritation... the battery lasts a long time and it recharges very fast. All-in-all I got a better razor this time around at a better price. Very happy indeed with this electric razor.</li>
    <li> I have bought a number of Norelcos, but last year I tried a Remington due to its lower price.  Well, it is back to Norelco this year when new blades were needed.  This Norelco cuts cleaner with a closer shave.  I believe the battery on the Remington had lost some of its power, which was made me decide to go back to Norelco.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers for 40 to 50 years. This one seems to be the best one of all. My last one pooped out after eight years. That&#x27;s a long time!</li>
    <li> l like the battery life and the amount of shaves you get from it. It&#x27;s a very practical gadget to have in your car, in case you run out of the house and need a decent shave on the go.!</li>
    <li> Not as heavy as my 15 year old model but still works good. If you haven&#x27;t used electric razors before it takes a long time for your skin to adapt, 2-4 weeks for some. Give it some time and you will like this razor.</li>
    <li> good as a electric razor. Misses some hairs.</li>
    <li> Best razor I ever owned, and I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 60 years.</li>
    <li> It broke the first time I used it and I didn&#x27;t like it at all.  A piece fell off and got lost so I couldn&#x27;t even put it back together.  It was not nearly as good as my old one.</li>
    <li> I like it; my last Philips Norelco lasted me 5 years.</li>
    <li> Simply amazing! My husband love it! He doesn&#x27;t has to use the classic razor anymore and the best of all is that rash on his neck has disappeared, goodbye to those annoyed pimples.</li>
    <li> Works great even for shaving my bald head. Use light pressure and you&#x27;ll get a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I read a few reviews of this product before I bought it, and I agree with others who noted that the motor is slower than earlier Norelco models.  Nonetheless, it shaves closer and quicker than the Norelco it replaces (a 15 year old XL-model).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me to my \\&quot;green\\&quot; comment.  The only reason I replaced the old XL is the battery wore out, and you cannot just replace the old rechargeable battery with a new one.  Norelco continues to build shavers with rechargeable batteries that are soldered into place, so that you can either send the shaver in for them to repair ($30 estimated) or if you dare, try to follow one of the many YouTube demonstrations of unsoldering and replacing a failed battery.  I considered doing this with my old shaver, but by the time I had bought an appropriate soldering iron and a replacement battery I would have as much into it as buying a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new shaver also has a soldered battery.  This is a classic example of planned obsolescence and is unconscionable in this second decade of the 21st century.  This is my main reason for the 3-star rating for a product that works like a 4-5 star . . . Boo-hiss, Norelco!!!</li>
    <li> A very inexpensive, well outfitted rechargable razor.  Feel a little cheap when holding it compared to my last one (not as solid), but works great!</li>
    <li> After many years, I finally caved and bought an electric razor and I&#x27;m very happy with this product. It took about two weeks to wear in but now I get a very close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Only had to charge once in over a month (used 4-6 times a week)&lt;br /&gt;Easy cleaning by simply running it under hot water&lt;br /&gt;Close shave that&#x27;s quick and easy&lt;br /&gt;Battery indicator&lt;br /&gt;Light and quiet&lt;br /&gt;Fits well in my hand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Expected a little more from the pop-up trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this was a steal for $49.99. Haven&#x27;t had any issues so far and would definitely recommend this razor!</li>
    <li> does not meet expectations in the cutting</li>
    <li> A good product but not good enough. I expected more than it could be. After shaving the first time, I found the shaver&#x27;s efficiency is not high. The stubble is still there so I have to shave back and forth again and again.</li>
    <li> Great product! 5 stars!! Will be back again!!Thank you!!</li>
    <li> shaver arrived on time and was as advertised.</li>
    <li> It has improved over the older models.  Smooth easy to use. 100% happy</li>
    <li> Been using Norelco razors since early 1960&#x27;s. They just keep getting better. Highly recommended. Often it is almost as cheap to buy a new razor as it is to buy replacement blades.</li>
    <li> Not impressed.  I tried this for 3 months and no longer use it.  It takes me more time to get a close shave than it does using a razor.</li>
    <li> Not a good shaver. I came off of using a really nice Braun but decided to not send so much money...what a mistake. This is good for throwing in a bag on a quick trip or sports. But for everyday grooming it misses the mark woefully. I think I&#x27;ll spend the extra money again my face, skin and facial hair would enjoy being treated a bit better.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut that well</li>
    <li> Works well and gives a close shave. I love that it operates while attached to the chord. My old shaver did not do that. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Does much, much better than my previous electric razor (a Panasonic).  Highly rec. at the price.  Nice to be able to clean it up with running water.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my son. He really likes it. Good purchase.</li>
    <li> This shaver is very convenient to use and the shipping is very fast.&lt;br /&gt;But a little design defect is no charger cap to aviod water inside.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a foil Braun shaver I had for YEARS.  Decided to give Norelco a try based on a friends suggestion.  It never got a close enough shave even after 4 weeks of usage.  And I found the 3-blade style too hard to control the location accurately when working around my goatee.  Ended up returning to mfg for refund and going back to Braun foil style.</li>
    <li> I really want to like this trimmer more. It fits in the hand well. It charges quickly. It just looks cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the trimmer does a poor job of shaving the hard to reach areas (mainly around the neck and jaw line) requiring many passes. Eventually this becomes rather irritating on the skin. However, I haven&#x27;t gotten any bumps because of this. In terms of closeness, you need to wet the razor head before you can get anything close to a decent shave. Lastly, the trimmer feature isn&#x27;t really useful. You can&#x27;t get it close to the skin, and it tends to bend and buckle because of how it&#x27;s hinged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, the negative out of the way, this razor IS easy to clean, the shave quality is decent if you routinely shave every day, and the battery lasts a long time. It&#x27;s a great razor to travel with.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it very much. His old one was so bad he had stopped shaving some of his face. Looks a lot better now.</li>
    <li> Chose 4 star rating in comparison  to shaver I was using.  Wish there was a setting to indicate when it is fully charged.  Previous electric razor had this feature..</li>
    <li> I bought this to shave my legs on days when I am in a huge hurry. It works, but its very unclear that it is any faster than just shaving in the shower.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver! My husband loves this kind and will not buy anything else. He&#x27;s had 2 in the 16 years I&#x27;ve been married to him and they seem to last a pretty long time.</li>
    <li> All the Norelco dry shavers \\&quot;work\\&quot; the same these days.  The old days of 5 lights or LCD screens or different colors and symbols are gone.  They now almost all use rechargeable batteries that don&#x27;t have the same useful life or power as the good old Ni-Cads I used to see last 10+ years (they now use either Li-Ion or NiMH, the NiMH seem to work better for me). The 6943 and other variations of cord only HQ56 shavers are gone, as are the 8100 and other HQ8/9 cord only models, or they are at ridiculous prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One version swivels, one version works wet and there are a few old left overs that basically do the same thing, but their batteries are aging as they have not been made for years.  So, unless you want to swivel or shave wet, it boils down to the difference between the current heads and here I am speaking of the HQ56 or the HQ8 or HQ9.  I have never used the RQ series and I never will.  I just don&#x27;t see the logic or buying an entire new head when you only need new blades, and $50 for blades each year is more than the entire price of the PT730.  So here it is, after shaving with Norelco for 45+ years with all the different heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The HQ56 are OK.  After you use them for a while, it takes a bit longer to get the thicker stubble and you have to go back over the same spot a little more.  They don&#x27;t seem to last a full year, but when they are new they do a decent job.  When they are cheap, and I mean $10 or so less than the HQ8/9 then they are a good deal and you won&#x27;t mind when the shaver batteries die in 3-4 years because the shaver was cheap as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you use the HQ56 for a while and then go to the HQ8/9 you will think a barber moved into your bathroom and just gave you a custom shave.  Not only that, you will find that it takes quite a bit less time, almost half.  I have yet to feel a significant difference between the HQ8 and HQ9, probably because they do different things better.  The HQ8 has fewer cutters and a few largerholes for longer hairs and the HQ9 has more holes and a system of concentric cutters for a faster shave.  Cutter count is not the only thing that makes a difference though.  The old fashioned HQ56 has nearly twice the cutters of the HQ8 and the HQ8 does a better job.  I mix them (HQ8 and 9)on a single shaver as I have yet to decide which I like best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in the HQ8/9 heads, the PT730 is the best deal.  Also, rather important, the 730 keeps the blade speed up when it is on batteries.  When Norelco switched to the newer batteries and dumped the Ni-cads (EU regulations) the early models had a big problem keeping the speed up after a few minutes of shaving.  If you wanted the fastest blade rotation, you had to use a cord.  A 50 minute battery life is pretty worthless when the shave stinks after 10 minutes because the blades are too slow.  This latest version seems to have fixed this issue pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the HQ56 heads, the 6948XL is the best deal.  If you want to save some money and you aren&#x27;t picky or in a hurry, the 6948XL will do the trick.  The 6948XL is made in China and the fit and finish are not as good as the shavers made in Holland.  However, I have had the newer Chinese shavers apart and the quality of the electronics is good.  So if the extra cost is not a problem, by all means enjoy the PT730.  And though it doesn&#x27;t matter as much these days, the 730 is made in China as well.  Looks like the 830 is the only model in this series still made in Holland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a quick note for anyone interested.  It looks as though all the wet shavers will now only work cordless.  Not a big problem, but for those of us who count on corded use, be aware.  And watch for a better price near Christmas.</li>
    <li> Quite, fast, and a smooth shave. This product is much better than the Panasonic it replaced. I&#x27;m a Norelco man from now on!</li>
    <li> cannot beat this product for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this thing; it&#x27;s the best electric razor i&#x27;ve ever owned. It has vastly superior batteries compare with prior shavers I&#x27;ve used, too.</li>
    <li> I bought this about a year ago. Works good. I like that you can use while it&#x27;s plugged in or not. Only thing I dislike is the trimmer extends straight out instead of at an upper angle.</li>
    <li> I use it for the initial shave then i pass a regular blade to finish the job</li>
    <li> Now having used this for a couple weeks, I can say it&#x27;s fantastic and I can&#x27;t believe these used to cost hundreds and hundreds of dollars.  My last one was 9 years ago and $220! This works just as good if not better. The instructions say to give it 3 weeks to really work but I found it perfect from the first shave onward.  Great product</li>
    <li> Last three of the shavers I bought were Norelco..&lt;br /&gt;I just cannot get a close shave with this one. Had it for six weeks now and results are the same. Takes me twice as long to shave and still can feel the stubble...Very disappointed as the other Norelcos were great.</li>
    <li> Terrific shaver, does a wonderful job, holds a charge a long time, and blades stay sharp a pretty long time.</li>
    <li> Great shave and quiet.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor.  Can&#x27;t beat the quality and value the Norelco provides</li>
    <li> My husband thoroughly has enjoyed this razor, very good quality, can charge it, holds a good charge, has good blades for sharp even cuts! This is a lot better for him, takes him less time getting ready for work!</li>
    <li> Bang for the buck. Have over a year now and no complaints</li>
    <li> This shaver was not as good as my old Philips Norelco .</li>
    <li> My husband has had this razor for awhile now and hates it.  He tries to shave his face and will go over and over the same spots with no results.  Not worth the money or the time.  We have bought Philips in the past (that used creams built inside it) and had better luck.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my husband. It provides a smooth close shave and can last a week without recharging when used very other day. So far it works pretty good.</li>
    <li> Disappointed. Not as close a shave as with my old film style.</li>
    <li> Shaving with this shaver is like running velvet across my face.  Norelco has definitely mastered the mechanism of the rotating, floating blades.  The better news is that a close shave is the result, with very little effort involved.  Cleaning is a snap, and the shaver retains its charge very well, and only takes less than 30 minutes to fully recharge.  I would recommend this shaver to anyone, including someone who does not currently use an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> I like the razor and the shave but the blades are only good for 60 days max and the replacement cost $40 per set is so the initial cost of the razor is reasonable but the need for replacement blades and cost of replacements is unreasonable. I will be going back to the old fashion razor a better shave but not as convenient. Bill Fraser.</li>
    <li> Service was excellent. Shaver worked great, and much quieter than old one. will buy another one when this one wears out.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my brother-in-law. He is very picky and put it on his amazon list so I knew it was what he wanted. He was very satisfied.</li>
    <li> good close shave, quiet, easy to clean. Charge lasts a long time</li>
    <li> I have been through several electric razors, and I&#x27;m a fairly slow buyer, using my razors until they croak.  My first electric was a rotary, and it didn&#x27;t shave super close, but was comfortable, did the job, and had a decent lifespan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my 2nd electric here, a Braun foil style that was pretty well reviewed. I liked it - the trimmer was quite effective, the shave was good, it held a charge well, and I could wash it easily with water.  It was less comfortable than the rotary.  It finally died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have this one, and am very pleased!  It&#x27;s much quieter than my two predecessor models.  The foil shaver must have prepped my face, because I could immediately get a very close shave, and with more comfort.  In fact, it&#x27;s so close that I have been doing every other day, and while I have some growth that way, I&#x27;m still socially acceptable.  I agree with some folks that the trimmer could be better, but it&#x27;s OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And best of all, this one is even easier to thoroughly clean than the Braun.  To do this, they recommend opening the rotary portion, washing, and then letting it dry open, which is fine by me - I get it almost showroom clean doing that, whereas the quick \\&quot;un-opened\\&quot; cleaning with the Braun allowed eventual accumulation of crud. I don&#x27;t want any of that automated machine cleaning stuff like other models have, as it costs more, and I figure there&#x27;s more stuff to break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s so good that I almost like shaving now!?!!</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my current electric (the blades were worn and it was going to be $20, again, original cost of old razor was ~$35).  Went back to this rotary design, much closer shave, power lasts as advertised, replacement blades are a fair price.  Very happy with the switch.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even buy the heads anymore. I find a good deal on the razor and replace it every year. It might be a little wasteful but you can buy the whole razor for not much more than the blades. The newest razors are ridiculously priced and actually feel like a step backwards. I don&#x27;t buy them anymore. So sad that it always ends up being a disposal, quick fix world. What is a child of the 80s to do?</li>
    <li> Very good price and the product does everything it&#x27;s supposed to. Decent shave, ability to wash, and the trimmer is handy to have. So for a budget option it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Holds a charge for a long time.  Close shave.  Really no complaints at all about this razor.  Would buy it all over again.</li>
    <li> This is my second norelco razor. The first cost approx. $ 115.00 and lasted eleven years.  The recent purchase cost approx $ 50.00 and appears to offer the same close shave. The new one does not show the condition of the battery charge, however, is supposed to alert me when time to charge. Supposed to last 40 hours before needing a charge.. I am completely satisfied with this purchase and recommend to anyone wanting a fast close shave.</li>
    <li> Like other purchasers I was originally put off by the lack of heft and seemingly puny motor, when compared to the previous Norelco shaver I owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, just like other reviewers, I learned within a couple of days that this product is up to the task!  The shave is closer (even when my Norelco had new blades it didn&#x27;t do as well), battery life is excellent.  My 5 o&#x27;clock shadow has been banished to around 8pm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only give it four stars because it doesn&#x27;t come with a travel pouch.</li>
    <li> PT730  has nice flexible shave head and very quite shaving. My husband likes use it every day.Very convenient and rapid.</li>
    <li> My husband finally switched over to an electric razor and couldn&#x27;t be happier. He gets a close shave.  It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean. He has sensitive skin in the neck area. A little witch hazel application after shaving does the trick.</li>
    <li> This is a very good razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple years ago the old Norelco razor I had would no longer hold a charge. It still shaved fine but I had to use the cord all the time. I did a lot or research on all the new razors and chose one of Braun&#x27;s new products that was expensive. Bad choice. The razor shaved ok but was very loud. So loud my wife made me shut the bathroom door when shaving. After only 2 years the screen gave out and I decided to try this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After charging the razor I turned it on. It was so quite I didn&#x27;t think it had charged correctly. It shaves great. Very close and quick even after missing a day. Holds a charge for 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> Did not give a close shave. After two weeks of usage the unit would not charge. Sent it back for refund.</li>
    <li> The razor failed to charge the second time that I tried to charge it after ten days of use. The battery life seems on the short side, especially if you want to travel with it. It shaves reasonably well but the build quality seems much lower than previous Norelco razors that I have owned. Never had any issues with their razors. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> The first one I received wouldn&#x27;t charge.  I sent it back for a replacement.  That one works, though it could be a closer shave.  Also, it does a pretty good job of getting 90 - 95% of the hairs, but the last bit can take a little while.</li>
    <li> It works even better than my old Philips. I know the battery doesn&#x27;t last as long when not plugged in electrical oulet but it shaves better. Good quality product.</li>
    <li> A clean, close shave and a battery that lasts a long time. I like the fact that you can run it under water in the sink to clean it out. Charges quickly and holds a charge well. I&#x27;m done buying razorblades at $18 a pop. (Another added bonus is you can shave or touch up anywhere without having a mirror or shaving cream). The price was much better than the Braun too. ;)</li>
    <li> It does not work. It will not hold a charge. It&#x27;s just money wasted. My loss and a Christmas present for Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it one star because that&#x27;s as low as I could go. It does not deserve a star.</li>
    <li> Gives a good shave but not sure a great shave. First shaver I have purchased in 25 years. The old Remington I owned never died so I had to buy a new shaver because i could not get parts for my Remington no more.</li>
    <li> I have yet to find an electric shaver that works.  It takes way to long to cut my beard hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco s&lt;br /&gt;electric razors for years and always liked the brand, but this one was the best yet.&lt;br /&gt;Very smooth and I get a close and comfortable shave and it is  very easy to handle</li>
    <li> For this price, we won&#x27;t bother buying new heads when they wear out, we&#x27;ll just get a new razor every couple of years.  Jim says it works great and the more he uses it, the better it shaves.</li>
    <li> This razor provides a smooth shave forthe price. It has a good balance and fits my hand well. Reasonably quiet. Easy to clean. Maintains charge for several shaves and chargrs quickly. Very good price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> It shaves nice and close. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it, is the body of the razor can be slippery if your hands are moist.</li>
    <li> I am used to a blade razor and this model doesn&#x27;t shave as closely. OTOH, the sideburn trimmer is great and I needed that as bladed razors don&#x27;t do that really clean cut.</li>
    <li> When my ten year old Norelco electric razor began to die I decided that I was willing to spend a little extra to get a replacement that would be with me for a very long time.  So I bought a SensoTouch 2D.  Big mistake!  It was far inferior to the one I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I returned it.  Then my old electric razor died and I had no choice but to get a new one.  So I reluctantly gave the PT 730 a try.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  It gives a fantastic shave, has no problem shaving my head or behind my ears, and the compact cord is very easy to travel with.  I lent it to my brother and dad and they decided to go buy their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and did I mention the cheap price?  Don&#x27;t be fooled:  This is STILL the best electric razor on the market even compared to ones that cost $200+.</li>
    <li> It gives a close shave without any skin irritation.  After the initial charging for eight hours, I was able to shave for nearly two weeks (every morning) before the recharge light came on.</li>
    <li> Good shave but hated the 8 hour recharge.  My 15 yr old Norelco didn&#x27;t take but an hour. The 8 hr. wasn&#x27;t worth the few dollars saved.</li>
    <li> I needed something that had wired mode because I can&#x27;t have this razor out charging somewhere at all times. It&#x27;s in the cabinet until I need to use it so I plug it in for use. Quiet, light weight, gets the job done very well.</li>
    <li> I used it daily. I&#x27;m pleased about shaving. After first charging I used it for 6 times (at least 50 min.) before recharging. I think this razor is a good choice.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco for years and this product shaves far less close than my 12 year old one. As long as I can still get new heads and able to build a battery back when needed for the old one this one will just be used as a back up.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t pick up the hair and snip it....My husband has to push really hard on face in order for the hair to be picked up.  He says it is just the type of razor that it is and doesn&#x27;t mean that it is bad.  He believes it is not designed for neck shaving more for facial hair.</li>
    <li> Good price.  Gives a smooth shave.  I like this more than past versions of the Norelco Razor.  It has held the charge for a long time, too.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Surprisingly quiet. Fairly good shape. Good value for the money. Would recommend. Don&#x27;t waste money on more expensive ones. It&#x27;s the blades that wear out.</li>
    <li> When I first held the Norelco PT730 the first thing I thought was &#x27;cheap.&#x27; The whole thing is very thin plastic except for the blades and the motor sounds under-powered. Contrary to Philips&#x27; advertising claims, it does not provide a close shave and feels abrasive like sandpaper, leaving visible red swathes on skin. They say wait a month for it to break in. However, after 3 months of use it has gotten worse not better. Apparently they also lie about having to replace the over-priced blades only every 12 months as well. I recently tried my dad&#x27;s Braun razor and it did noticeably better around corners and edges without irritating my skin as much as this Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt;* Holds a charge for a while, approximately 1 - 2 weeks of daily use&lt;br /&gt;* Quicker than manual razor for touch ups of flat surfaces of the face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;* Not a close shave, does not get edges (manual razor required to get hair on and around chin as well as under jaw and around throat)&lt;br /&gt;* Visibly irritates skin, feels awful&lt;br /&gt;* Blades wear out 4x quicker than advertised&lt;br /&gt;* Replacement blades are $25, half the price of the razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be getting a Braun instead and would recommend the same.</li>
    <li> I love Emmet Fox&#x27;s refreshing way of looking at Christianity and the Bible. He has some great ideas to meditate on. Not your standard religious book which is refreshing. My advice is to seek the wisdom of others but take everything with a grain of salt. Your own spiritual journey is far better when you follow your heart and refuse to be a disciple of any human.</li>
    <li> Works fine!  A well-known company with a good reputation for good products and this razor has a great price.  I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard.  I can finish a shave in 30 seconds if I shave every day.  So far, everything working well!</li>
    <li> its easy to use and clean heads need a little more sharper edges but so far so good. it does the job</li>
    <li> Exellent,thanks that was exactly what I was looking for,looking forward to come back again soon.Will rate you to my friends</li>
    <li> exceeded all expectations- close shave, no skin irritation. you won&#x27;t be sorry if you buy it. great buy!what else can i say?</li>
    <li> My 96 year old dad left his razor in a hotel room.  Purchased this replacement, charges fast and shaves close.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and performs as advertised. No problems with the device pulling hair while shaving, which is why I needed a new razor.</li>
    <li> Great Razor. Holds the charge well, giving a comfortable (start w the neck) shave. Gets close but takes some time which is fine by me. If you have a recliner kick back &amp; enjoy. Thumbs up here but if you&#x27;re looking for a last minute speedy shave you might want to step it up one model.</li>
    <li> Forget the $100+ razors, and the faff of electric ones you take into the shower.  This razor gives a good shave on a thick beard, and the battery lasts.  I travel regularly, and the battery will last 2 weeks on the road no problem.  I had the old version of this razor for 10 years until my toddler dropped it down the loo (accidentally), otherwise I&#x27;m sure it would have kept going for another 10 years.  The integrated sideburn trimmer makes this all you need.  Not shaved for 2 weeks?  No problem, shear off the beard with the trimmer and smooth off the stubble with the razor.  The first time I used this razor many years ago I did find I took 2 weeks to get comfortable with it.  But with this new razor, I guess my skin is OK with it, as the first shave with the new razor was as good as the old razor.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the comfort and smooth shave from this razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m often wary of reviews from customers who have had the product for only a week or two -- I want to know how it holds up over time. I&#x27;ve used this razor daily since I bought it in June, and I&#x27;m a big fan. It provides a smooth shave, easy to clean, and most of all, the battery life is excellent. I noticed I wasn&#x27;t having to charge it as often as my previous razor, so I started keeping track, and one charge will last me three weeks -- again, shaving every day. I appreciate that I can go on trips without having to pack the charger.</li>
    <li> My husband hasn&#x27;t bought a new shaver for about 10 years, so I got him this one for Christmas. It works great, and it makes his face much smoother than the old one did. It says to give it about three weeks to attain maximum effectiveness. This was accurate. Whatever it did over those three weeks to assimilate itself to his facial environment, his shave did get better and better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with Norelco for almost 40 years.  My last one was a 8240 with HQ9 shaving heads.  I decided to go back to the cheaper model with the HQ8 head.  This one does a better job than the more expensive model.  It&#x27;s also easier to clean with less little cutters.  The only improvement that could be made is to have a power touch model that charges in one hour rather than eight.  I like having a razor that can be used when plugged if the charge were to run out.  The Aqua tech models charge in one hour, but can only be used cordless.</li>
    <li> Not enough strength to cut my beard. Sending it back for a stronger one. Would not recommend this product. Sorry I bought it.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor at a good price.  My husband had been using electric razors for years and took a 3 year hiatus to try the &amp;#34;bearded look&amp;#34;.  When he had to shave his beard, it was time for a new electric razor and this is the one I chose for him.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  Nice shave, easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Norelco razor as a replaceemt for an older Norelco razor.  I have always relied on the quality of Norelco razors over the years, having owned several.  This razor shaves as good as my previous Norelco&#x27;s.  Same excellent quality and easy to maintain with a water rinse a few time a week. Norelco never lessens the quality of their product.</li>
    <li> We have two Norelcos and they work great. Good brand, easy clean up and easily charged. This company has always put out a great product.</li>
    <li> Have always been disappointed with closeness of shave (or lack thereof) from electric razors. This one really is as good as a new disposable blade and way more convenient.  You can pay much, much more for an electric razor but it won&#x27;t shave as well!</li>
    <li> The PT730 replaced my two-year old Norelco 7315.  The PT730 is lighter and fits my hand better, and it appears to have somewhat longer battery life per charge.  Excellent shaving results.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for the previous unit.  The previous unit gave me satisfactory service.  Previous unit was damaged by accident.</li>
    <li> Razor seems to lack power, but does cut the beard, though slowly.  I would go up to a more powerful one next time.</li>
    <li> No matter how many times or how hard I push the thing, it does not cut close to the skin. All I get is red rash on my neck from the constant going over the same area trying to cut the face hair.</li>
    <li> Well worth the the money. Shaves better than my old philips razor. Shaves almost as good as my old screen wahl 4000.&lt;br /&gt;Blades last a lot longer.</li>
    <li> Holds long charge and gives nice shave and quiet. Easy cleanup. Bought a remington first threw in garbage as was annoying.</li>
    <li> Razor works well and is easy to use.  Have used other rechargeable razors in past but this is fast and gives a close shave.</li>
    <li> I am glad I ordered this electric razor.  It was a good value, and I am pleased with it in every way.</li>
    <li> The shaver does a poor job on the hair below nyour chinline &#x3D; your neck.  Have to go over it with a regular razor after I fi8niswh shaving with this.</li>
    <li> Being handicap, I need electric razor to keep off my feet. This one shaves very smooth, but it&#x27;s giving me razor burns, around the corners (chin). Has advertisted running time of 45 minutes. Mine hasn&#x27;t ran down yet! Otherwise I like it, your mileage may very.</li>
    <li> I chose this for my father. He has a rather rough beard. This worked swimmingly on him. Its sturdy ,easy to hold. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This razor does not cut that close in a given time compared to others I have bought, and for a lot less money too. Look at other models rather than this one, and I have tried a lot of them over the years. Its not very smooth over your face either.</li>
    <li> I have a spine injury that I&#x27;ve lived with now for 11 months and one surgery, so far. Recently I concluded (reluctantly) that I could no longer shave safely with my trusty disposable blade razor, So I looked over the options for an electric, coming up with the Philips Norelco PT730 Powertouch as the best compromise between features and cost. (I also read attentively the reviews here.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impressions can be misleading; Norelco, in it&#x27;s little manual, warns new buyers to PLEASE use the razor for 3 weeks before drawing any conclusions. That was good advice. Initially I was ambivalent - and not only because I have a congenital dislike for electric razors. The PT730 seemed underpowered, even for my moderately light beard. But as time went by I developed a certain affection for the PT730 (the \\&quot;Stockholm Syndrome\\&quot;?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, after using the Norelco for almost a month, I believe it is very serviceable, comfortable and super-easy to clean. It rests in my hand so naturally the two seem custom-fitted to each other. I&#x27;m discovering little techniques, not initially obvious, that let me get a good shave in difficult-to-get-at places. Shaving is now a chore (a brief one), rather than something long and difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t changed my mind on one thing: even a quite decent electric razor won&#x27;t shave as close as the most humble 2-edge disposable blade. Not for my beard. But the former is more convenient to use and surely costs less in the long run -- or even the mid-term. So when closeness counts most, I know what to do. But for others with different priorities, and for blade-users like me when ill fate intervenes, it&#x27;s nice to have a solid, comfortable performer like the Norelco PT730 available.</li>
    <li> Far superior to my Braun.I especially like the ability to wash the head without ruining the unit Good choice for me</li>
    <li> highly recommend this product. charged it up and been shaving with it ever since . great product.. used Norelco for 30+ years.</li>
    <li> Its been more than 2 weeks since i bought this, still sometime it hurts while using this razor. I dont know whats wrong..</li>
    <li> This razor is very good. I wanted one that could be used with either a cord or cordless and this model does that. I also like the feature of being able to wash it out under the faucet. Shaves close and battery last for a couple weeks of shaves.</li>
    <li> I have aways used these razors and like everthing else over the years they have changed.  A few times I tried other brands but allways came back. Comfort and getting a close shave are my number one objectives. This razor does just that.  This is the battery one and it holds a charge for a long time.  Holds a charge, comfortable, gives me a close shave, I think thats what it is suppose to do.  What more can you ask for?  OK the price was a little higher but buying it on Amazon cured that for me.&lt;br /&gt;I Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Have used similar Norelco products in the past and think this one gives a better shave.  It is quiet and easily cleaned.</li>
    <li> Takes a few passes but it gets the job done for a good price. Holds its charge for a good amount and I use it wet for a closer shave.</li>
    <li> I owned an earlier simular Phillips Norelco model racer, which worked fine, but tripped the ground fault interrupter in my receptacle on several occasions when charging the battery.  I actually expected smoother shaving with the newer model, but it&#x27;s the same.  The feature I really like, it can be rinsed with hot water after shaving.</li>
    <li> This razor gives a very close shave, but it has a few faults that kind of annoy me that I&#x27;m unable to look past and ignore. The three heads are guards for the blades underneath them. You run it across your face and the hair gradually find its way inside the guards and gets cut by the blades underneath. With this design you should not be getting cut while shaving. It will give you a nice close shave, but you have to run the razor across your face so often in the same spots multiple times in order to achieve this. Because of this it can easily irritate your skin. Other than that there is also the occasional pinch feeling when a hair is pulled from the skin before it has a chance to be cut by the blades. I think if it had a more powerful/faster motor, it would greatly reduce this problem and increase shaving time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The documentation that came with the product said that you&#x27;re supposed to give it a couple months for your skin to adjust to it, which is about how long I&#x27;ve had it, but so far there have been no improvements for me. The first few times you shave with this thing though you will have patches of hair left over because you may not be familiar with the technique needed to best shave your face with it. You will at least get better with that over time.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a supplement for my Fusion blade razor, for times when I am in a hurry, or whatever. Also, the price of blades keeps rising. The instructions say that you must use it for at least 30 days to get your skin accustomed to it, after which you can return it (up to 60 days), if not satisfied. It seems fair enough, so I did that, and I&#x27;m now up to a month or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am reasonably satisfied, but there is no way that it shaves as close as a blade. I certainly notice this toward the end of the day (having shaved in the morning), but it&#x27;s not as if there is visible stubble. I can feel it when rubbing my hand over face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit cumbersome to hold, as compared with the Braun I used to use occasionally and certainly takes up a lot more space, e.g., when packing it for a trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer seems to have no effect at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably keep it rather than avail myself of the 60-day return option.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad, and he like it. The price was good as well. good looking. no problem so far</li>
    <li> My Philips Norelco PT730/41 Razor arrived from Amazon and works as advertised.  Cuts very fast, close, and efficiently.  It holds its charge for about a week for me! I like the blinking warning light which comes on when the batteries have about 5 minutes of charge left.  Appears very well engineered.  Best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I would strongly recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
    <li> I like the Phillips Norelco Power Touch because it gives a close shave , is very quite, cleans very easily and is comfortable in to use.</li>
    <li> BOUGHT THIS TO REPLACE AN OLD PHILLIPS RAZOR...FOUND THAT IT IS VERY ROUGH ON FACE, PULLS BEARD AND DOES NOT SHAVE AS CLOSE AS MY 8 YEAR OLD ONE THAT DIED</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver last year and it still works good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a number of razors over the years and this is the quietest. It&#x27;s plastic-y so not sure how long it will last. The power cord is a cheap stiff straight cable compared with the coiled, rubbery ones they used to have. This is designed to be rinsed but I prefer to brush it out after each shave. But unlike older models, this has a deep, hard to reach compartment and it&#x27;s more difficult to clean. Have to say it shaves close! So far it&#x27;s satisfactory.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my father.  He is very picky about his razor and says this one is a good one.  He&#x27;s 97 so he&#x27;s been through a few razors.  Ha!  Would buy again.  He is having me buy a spare head...just in case.</li>
    <li> This is just an average razor. I bought this one because the higher end razors they have out wont work while they are charging. This one allows you to shave while plugged in but it takes 8hrs to charge.</li>
    <li> I thought this razor as described would function as well as my previous razor (Norelco Model # 7240 XL).  The new razor is adequate, however it does not shave as closely as my Norelco 7240 XL did..for many years.</li>
    <li> A good light weight shaver. Does a good job but takes a little more time than the more expensive Norelco shavers.</li>
    <li> Razor is what I expected from Phillips, it gives a smooth shave and it about $10.00 cheaper than the discount stores here.</li>
    <li> A three-year-old Remington, which never really did work well (even with brand-new blades), suddenly bit the dust on Friday.  I received my Philips-Norelco PT730 yesterday, charged it up, and used it for the first time this morning.  Immediately, I was struck by how good it felt.  There was no hint of pulling, and not even slight harshness on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was done shaving, I ran the palm of my hand over my face and neck.  Even with four full days&#x27; growth, I was as smooth as fine china!  Blade-smooth, even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m duly impressed.  Supposedly, an electric will take a few weeks to work at its optimum level.  If that&#x27;s true, I look forward to what it&#x27;s going to be like next month.</li>
    <li> This was supposed to be a Christmas give, but my hubby seized the package as soon as it arrived and has been using it daily. He loves this razor!</li>
    <li> This is clearly NOT my old Norelco razor.  I went cheap this time figuring why spend $100 more on a razor that was probably not much better than this one.  I certainly hope the Norelco&#x27;s that cost $100 more than this are MUCH better than this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this razor back in March 2012, so I have been using it for over 5 months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it was new with a new set of blades I was concerned about it.  It shaved. And it shaved what felt like close.  But it did not feel right.  It did not feel like the blades were turning that strongly. It felt weak.  I would shave at around 6:30 AM each morning.  It felt good.  By the end of the day though, my beard was very rough.  So it would get me through the day ok but at night, the family did not like a kiss from their dad or husband due to the roughness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have the older 8200 series I think it was (maybe 8500) and that was a very different shave. It stayed much closer ALL day and into the night.  Some days I would forget to shave the next day because it did not feel like it needed it. Of course, by 11:00 I would regret that but the point was that it was CLOSE. Much closer than this new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of that, the last month or so the shave has been getting rougher.  The skin hurting after the shave.  I figured the blades were getting dull but how could that be? It had only been 4 months then and the manual said to replace the blades after 1 year.  Finally, after several more weeks of it getting rougher I bought a new set of blades.  Ah!  All better now.  Nice and clean shave again and no burning sensation on the skin.  So - don&#x27;t expect to have these blades last a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard is not thick or tough. So I definitely think my experience is about the best someone could expect. I know plenty of men who have thicker beard and I would think they would really hate this blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I need a new razor I will try Norelco one more time, and the more expensiveversions, in hopes that they did not throw quality out completely, just on their cheap line.  They used to be the best. It would be a shame if they are just like all the rest now - crappy shaves that cost a lot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor 4 times so far and it&#x27;s just awesome. It gives me a way closer shave than my fusion proglide ever did and is less irritating. I can&#x27;t say much about the battery/charging because i have not had to charge it yet. I took it straight out of the box and used it without charging, so far its gone through four 5-10 minute shaving sessions and does not need charged.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco PT30/41 Powertouch Electric Razor works great!  It sounds weak, but it isn&#x27;t.  I can easily get a clean shave after 3 days growth.</li>
    <li> I have been using my pt730/41 about 2 months and it works great. I get a nice smooth shave and the razor is easy to clean. I do travel and wish that it came with a carrying case to put the cord, charger and cleaning brush in.</li>
    <li> Good product.... but&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) caused irritation after first few shaves&lt;br /&gt;2) doesn&#x27;t do a clean shave under the chin... leaves some hair, the trimmer with the product is also not so helpful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After few months of use, the irritation is now worse and no clean shave possible under the chin.... i really want to return it...</li>
    <li> I only shave once or twice a week, so my stubble gets pretty um... well stubbly. Trick is to make sure your skin is dry. Damp hair or skin like after a shower isnt dry. Humidity in the bathroom isnt dry enough. The flip up edger is great for sideburns and whatnot.</li>
    <li> The Norelco PT730/41 electric shaver is giving me the cleanest, fastest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Product is great. Great brand. Husband has used this type before, so was interested in another razor for his use.</li>
    <li> gift .. he loved it!!</li>
    <li> Got it with $5 off promo code. It spins slower than the higher end models but the result is the same. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> After shaving once in the morning, about an hour later you can feel like you did not shave at all. recharging is quite often during the month.&lt;br /&gt;I kept my old shaver in case of this junk they sell.  old back up.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor after doing an appreciable amount of online research and I am NOT disappointed.  The price was very good and the package arrived sooner than I expected.  Finally, the quality of the shave is as good as it could be.</li>
    <li> Having replaced my 20 year old Norelco due to battery failure ,  I am just&lt;br /&gt;amazed at how well the new PT730 works. Quiet motor, close shave, easy cleaning, and rcvd by mail in 3 days. Seems to hold a charge forever, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sanford</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. It&#x27;s a great razor for the price - leaves my boyfriend&#x27;s face super smooth!</li>
    <li> My husband likes the razor very much. The packaging was not too hard to deal with. It charges and functions fine.</li>
    <li> SINCE GOING TO A ELECTRIC RAZOR IN THE MILITARY. I HAVE ENJOYED THE COMFORT OF NO CUTS FROM BLADES. IT CUTS I SAY 90% AS GOOD AS A TRACT 2 BLADE. DEPENDS ON ONE&#x27;S FACE. THE CHARGE LAST MONTHS. I ONLY BUY PHILIPS NORELCO!!!!</li>
    <li> Works well and has held up well</li>
    <li> It is not made in the US as indicated in the description. I do not expect that. Quite upset about that!</li>
    <li> Good shave for a while, but quickly dulls.</li>
    <li> I would definately recommend this product to the users, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> My 5 year old Remington rotary (with 5 year old heads and blades)gives a much nicer, closer shave in about half the time as the PT730. I used the Norelco PT730 daily for almost 40 days with disappointing results - took much longer to shave and never really got a close shave. Today I got the old Remington out and did half my face with the new one, half with the old one, and there was no comparison - will be using the old Remington until the battery finally dies. I am disappointed with the shave quality with the PT730 and have concluded it&#x27;s not going to get any better in another 40 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good stuff - I really liked the ability to wash out the shaver with water. Much better than my old Remington. It required charging much less frequently that my old Remington, and it looks better than my old Remington. It just didn&#x27;t shave as well for me.</li>
    <li> Met all expectations.</li>
    <li> I finally had to retire my old model Norelco that I have used for several years. The second replacement rechargeable battery only lasted 6 months before self-destructing and, apparently frying the circuit board in the process. When I put in my 3rd replacement battery, it could not revive the old &amp;#34;soldier&amp;#34;. So I investigated and compared the currently available Norelco&#x27;s. This seemed to fit my needs without getting into nuances of performance for which I have no need nor desire. I have a beard, and just try to keep it managed and my face reasonably smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I have used various iterations of Norelco razor for 40 years. Even though this razor should have been somewhat of an upgrade from my previous model, in terms of features, this is the first time in memory that I experienced my new Norelco razor as a &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; product than my old one. It&#x27;s not just that it has a lighter &amp;#34;heft&amp;#34; from the old one, I realize that may be a function of the newer electronics. My experience is that the motor and rotors turn more slowly. The off/on switch doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; as solid (granted it does have a cover to protect it from water). The trimmer, which I use every time I shave, does not have the solid mechanism to engage it that my old one had. The new one depends on freeing it up to allow a spring to pop it out. It is not as easy nor as convenient to engage. With my old one, I could just flip the razor in my hand; my thumb would just naturally come to rest on the mechanism, which I could engage by just pushing forward by straightening out my thumb. With this new one, after flipping the razor over, I have to work my way up towards the head, find the latch mechanism with my thumb, then pull it down. by flexing my thumb, to free the trimmer to pop out.&lt;br /&gt;These seem like minor details, but they add up to just an &amp;#34;Okay&amp;#34; experience, after my old one.  I also subjectively just don&#x27;t trust that it will last as long as my old one. However, I like the Norelco shaving experience. I will keep it. I am not sure if I will try to keep it going when the battery fails by replacing the battery or look for something different. I don&#x27;t know. This one may &amp;#34;grow&amp;#34; on me.</li>
    <li> Works better then my old Norelco.  It is heaver then the old one....one would make the assumption that its better now that it weighs more.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe they just added a rock in side??????&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it as a excellent purchase to anyone.</li>
    <li> The Norelco PT730, is just as advertised, the letters of recommendation were helpful and I find that it exceeded what I expected. The last Norelco I bought was about ten years ago and I was very pleased.  I would have been happy if this one would have been just as good.  It was better.</li>
    <li> This razor has been very good at getting the little hairs and cutting all the way up to the skin. There&#x27;s absolutely no fear of getting nicked. It&#x27;s probably even safe enough for shaving your scrotum.</li>
    <li> This shaver was just what I needed. I looked at all of them and found this one to be a minimalist&#x27;s dream. I didn&#x27;t need the &amp;#34;extras&amp;#34; offered (at a higher price.)  My last Norelco lasted abount 14 years before I decided to get a new one. I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
    <li> Better than any other Norelco shaver, I have owned.. best to use pre shave lotion for a smoother shave. Thus far OK</li>
    <li> Bough for son who started shaving - he likes it and gets the job done. We&#x27;ll have to see about logevity.</li>
    <li> This replaced a Norelco razor my father has used for years.  He is very happy with the way this one shaves and it is a great shaver for the price.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly effective shaver for the price.  If you only listen to it, you wouldn&#x27;t think it would be powerful enough to provide an effective shave, but it does.  Not sure if battery life is as long as other shavers, but it seems to last a couple of weeks, which makes it appropriate to take on trips.  Would definitely consider for future purpose.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this shaver...it is very cheap &amp; not worth much more than $25.00 at the most...to class it as a \\&quot;disposable\\&quot; would be a better derscription.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Up-date...pitiful!</li>
    <li> Has a trimmer. Most similar $$ models don&#x27;t.  Charges is 3-4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;Produces a close shave.  Washable heads BUT YOU MUST remove heads every 60 days because a buildup occures between head and cutting edge.  ( 3 minute job)  I had this problem with a prior Norelco razor</li>
    <li> I had not used an electric razor before. I find that the Norelco does an adequate job, although not as close a  shave as a regular razor. However, it is so simple to use, and faster.</li>
    <li> The razor is light weight and works very well. If you are looking for a basic shave with a trimmer that works on sideburns and mustache then consider this low priced but good quality razor.  Works for several hours on one charge.</li>
    <li> i haven&#x27;t used an electric in a few years and was not happy with my past experiences with the straight foil types.  i had lots of irritation, the shaves took a long time and still weren&#x27;t anywhere near as good as a blade shave.  After reading lots of reviews i decided to give the Norelco rotary head a try.  This is one great shaver which gives me a very close shave with very little irritation in a reasonable time frame.  i have had this shaver for six weeks and have used it every day.  I charge the battery after four days use and it seems to have full power for my four shaves  I clean it out frequently with the little brush it came with and thats all it needs.  This is a simple unit with out the unecessary bells and whistles but still has the better quality lift and cut heads on the more expensive models.  With the free Amazon Prime shipping it&#x27;s a great value also.</li>
    <li> Good razor that gets the job done. Cleaning it is extremely easy and the razor heads only need to be replaced every 12 months although maybe sooner if you shave every day (like 10-11 months).</li>
    <li> This is the best Norelco razor I have ever owned. I have own many Norelcos since I started using them when I started living my school dorm in 1968/1969 school year. Most of them have been corded because they were cheaper. But I last had another brand cordless a friend give me, it had a trimmer on the back which I liked for eyebrow triming. So when it quit me I saw this model had the trimmer on the back and went for this cordless model. The shave is as close as a blade for me and not all electrics do that. I have a light beard I am half white and half American Indian or if you need the PC term Native American so my beard is slow growing and I need only shave about once every 3 days.</li>
    <li> In my old age, my skin has gotten more prone to razor nicks, so I&#x27;ve been using the PT730 for 6 months now. Perhaps my beard is extra course, but it takes 8-10 minutes to get everything reasonably close. Individual hairs get skipped and it takes multiple passes to get them all, as if some are just too thick to fit between the fins. Afta Pre-electric shave gel helps prevent razor burn, but there&#x27;s no speeding up the process. Fortunately it was only $34 at Amazon when I got it, otherwise I&#x27;d feel ripped off. At least I no longer get razor nicks, so that&#x27;s the bright side!</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a replacement to my over 7 year old previous philips norelco shaver!! 7 years is amazing out of a shaver so that is why I stuck with philips norelco because they are very reliable shavers.  This shaver works very well, has the moving heads as well as a popup trimmer.  This has a lithium ion battery which lasts longer as well as has a quick charge feature where you can charge it enough for one shave in a few minutes.  It also has a battery low indicator so you know when you have to charge it up so it doesn&#x27;t die on you in the middle of shaving like the older ones would so that&#x27;s pretty cool.  Overall this is an excellent shaver and I will always stick with philips norelco.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my boyfriend as a birthday present. It is at good quality. Thanks to Amozon and the mailman.</li>
    <li> i have more or less a year with this shaver and Can say tha the motor is rather weak; it strugles to do it&#x27;s work, so in the end I spend double the time trying to que to those rogue hairs tha refuse to go.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for; no issues with quality or workmanship; it does what you expect from a cheap razor - not much. Upgrade and get a better razor.</li>
    <li> Better than my old one.</li>
    <li> It has a lithium-ion battery which means it is smaller than normal, and has a motor to match.  The motor has lower rpm which makes it very quiet for an electric shaver.  Even so, it does a nice job cutting whiskers.  My Remington was heavier, louder, and could not reliably cut whiskers on my face.  I am very pleased I made the switch.  Cleaning is a snap.  I even like the color.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Best shave I have ever gotten from an electric shaver. I have always used Brauns that cost 2-3 times more than this Norelco but this one wins the shaving contest.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers since I started shaving. The Norelco PT730 is a decent shaver for the price. The pros are it&#x27;s light can charge fairly quick, has pop up trimmer, and float-able heads that contour to your face (they aren&#x27;t as good as I thought but that could be because I&#x27;m very skinny and have lot of bones that protrude more then the average guy). The cons are very simple motor is weak and the quality of all products these days is just lower than even 10 years ago. I also found a very interesting thing that it just doesn&#x27;t do a good job by the neck area I read some other reviews who had the same issue. It also requires you to go over the same area a couple of times and then I noticed it got a little better after around 4 shaves I guess the heads needed some breaking in. Overall if you want a shaver that&#x27;s not going to break the bank and gets the job done to anywhere between 95%-99% this would be a fair choice.&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now I&#x27;ll update if things change)</li>
    <li> This is very easy to use, easy to clean and easy to maintain. Charges quickly, and is very quiet. The shave is as grat as I hoped to be.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver before. Two things I don&#x27;t like: (1) you need to annually buy new shaver heads, and (2) it doesn&#x27;t shave close enough. I have a light beard, so I can imagine the trouble heavy beards would give it.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it again because I thought it would have improved. The best thing is it is less expensive than others. Guess I know why.</li>
    <li> I am 67 years old and have only used Norelco all my life. New shaver gives best shave yet😃</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor!  It had very mixed reviews, but it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I purchased this while I was using my far more expensive Panasonic shaver. There is absolutely no contest between this and the Panasonic. I now only use this Norelco and give it my highest rating. After using this Norelco, I&#x27;d give the Panasonic (which costs more than twice as much and requires annual very costly foil replacements and which is far too rough on the skin) a single star!</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re father&#x27;s day gifts for my father and father-in-law. they like it.</li>
    <li> Much closer shave than my previous shaver. However, it&#x27;s not super comfortable if you&#x27;re prone to ingrown hairs. Otherwise, it makes cleaning up much easier and the trimming unit is a great addition.</li>
    <li> I use this razor before I take my shower. It removes 95% of my whiskers.  Then in the shower I shave the last 5% off with a Gillette Fusion razor using Pantene Conditioner as a lubricant (and for the hair still left on my head).  I get 6-8 months usage out of one Fusion cartridge this way. The Norelco razor battery has to be recharged overnight every 6 weeks or so.</li>
    <li> Open to clean it, and the whole thing falls apart, very difficult to put back together.  I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Good but could be a bit more powerful</li>
    <li> Got to have patience when using this razor. You will have to go over each area at least twice to get a good shave. I like it though.</li>
    <li> This is my first ever electric shaver, and I am quite pleased with my purchase. I got tired of getting super irritated skin and cuts when shaving with a regular razor, and replacing the blades was super expensive. So I bought this one, and while it doesn&#x27;t get as close as a regular razor, it still gets quite close in addition to being fast and easy to use. And I can still use my regular razor to get the hard-to-reach spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says in the manual that your skin may get irritated when you first start using it, and that was a bit true. But if you continue to use it your skin will grow accustomed to it, and it will be very pleasant to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know about the charge time since I unplug it, use it, and plug it back in again. But I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the battery dying. In addition I&#x27;ve only had it for a few months, so I haven&#x27;t had to deal with replacing the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is very easy. Just pop open the top, rinse it out, dry off the outside, and leave it open to air dry. It&#x27;s not meant to be used on a wet face though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this razor has made me fall in love with electric shavers. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> When I first tried this razor I was hesitant because it is very light, very quiet and does not seem to be running very fast. However, in the area that counts, which is how it shaves, it does a good job for me. I generally keep two razors around in case one fails. In this case my back up did just that and I ordered the Norelco, even though my less than a year old Remington is working fine. So I was able to compare the two side by side. Clearly the Norelco gives me a better shave and also the charge lasts longer. I get about 9 shaves per charge using the shaver 5-6 minutes for each shave. No electric razor that I have ever had shaves as close as a blade and neither does this one. However, it does a good job and is a very good buy.</li>
    <li> Broke within 2 months.</li>
    <li> I got this as a present for my brother&#x27;s birthday, and he seems to like it very much.</li>
    <li> I is not shaving as close as I taught it would but it will have to work for now.</li>
    <li> It took too long to arrive.Grew beard in meantime, but the shaver whisked it off immediately once it did arrive.Shaver does an excellent job and I can recommend it to all</li>
    <li> Use it every day, works great.</li>
    <li> I like how quiet the shaver is and does a nice job. Not nearly as close a shave as the Panasonic, but when I don&#x27;t want to wake up the rest of the house this is the shaver I turn too.  Keeps a charge for a long time and the trimmer is effective. The tabs on the plastic protective cap are easy to break and then the cap becomes easy to loose. Cleanup is a breeze.  I&#x27;ve been using is for maybe six months and still as good as new.</li>
    <li> Very Pleased with the performance of this razor. Have used Norelco razors for many years. Like this one best because of the ease of cleaning.</li>
    <li> Works well and light weight.</li>
    <li> I had a norelco growing up and it worked reasonably well.  This one, although it seems &amp;#34;lower powered&amp;#34; works just as well.  It gives a reasonably close shave and it gets most hairs, some flat ones take a little extra time.  All shavers I&#x27;ve ever used except blades are like this though. It cost all of thirty-five dollars with a five dollar coupon that was available when I bought it.  If it was a one hundred dollar razor, I&#x27;d give it 4 stars, but for the price it&#x27;s a screamin&#x27; deal.  Probably if you have super heavy beard it isn&#x27;t enough.  However I&#x27;m pretty average and sincerely doubt I&#x27;d find anything significantly better than this for me no matter what the price.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> For the price, it&#x27;s OK, but doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as would like, has no popup sideburn trimmer, but is a good secondary shaver.</li>
    <li> This razor has not cut the longer hair under my husbands chin but does a nice job with the rest.</li>
    <li> For years I had considered changing from razor &amp; lather to electric shaving but hesitated after reading harsh reviews of leading electric shavers.  But the Philips Norelco PT730 lives up to the very positive reviews it has been getting, and I am glad I took the plunge.  Its first test was a three-day growth of tough stubble that it handled well.  I recommend reading the owner&#x27;s manual and especially attending to the sound advice to use only the electric shaver (no lather shaving) for the first 21 days on a clean, dry beard--no magic lotions or potions needed.  As best I can tell from my research, the newer cutting heads that come as original equipment on the PT730 provide some of the shaving success.  I was also surprised and pleased by the very effective pop-up trimmer once I mastered its use.  So far I have not run out of battery during a shave as I usually recharge after two thorough shaves.  The PT730 is miles ahead of the foil shaver I tried years ago.  So far, I find it well worth its modest purchase price.</li>
    <li> A nice razor for the money. Smooth comfortable shave, but not quite as good as the 8240XL which is more expensive. I think the main difference is the heads. This razor comes with the HQ8 heads and the 8240 XL comes with HQ9 heads. One downside to this razor is that it does not come with a carrying case are stand.</li>
    <li> I chose this model for price. It doers a good job. I only shave 4X a week, one being with a safety razor.</li>
    <li> I can certainly tell why this particular electric razor is the best selling razor.  I loved mine as soon as I got it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor now for about six weeks and absolutely love it.  The battery charge lasts a long time and gives a nice glow alert to let you know it&#x27;s time for a recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor gives me a really close shave in a reasonably short time.  I&#x27;m now age 75 (almost 76) and have used lather and a safety razor up until about nine months ago.  The wife and I took a long travel with a small travel trailer and it wasn&#x27;t always handy to use the lather/razor so I purchased an inexpensive, corded Norelco razor and liked the shave and the convenience.  After about four months I decided to upgrade and purchased a Panasonic ES-RT51.  The Panasonic had some nice features but I had to work like crazy to get just a decent shave and never got a really close one so decided to try this PT730 and I really like this one.  It gives a very close shave, is real easy to clean, lasts a long time for each charge and was reasonably priced here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> and he seems to like it a lot.  I recommend for wives to purchase for their husbands.  great buy for the price!</li>
    <li> I purchased two months ago and have been pleasantly surprised. I have light growth but shaving with my old Braun seemed to take me forever. I always struggled with the neck and jaw area. This razor saves me lots of time by requiring fewer passes. Other reviewers complained about this razor being under powered and although it runs very quietly it cuts well. The rechargable battery lasts me almost three weeks. I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I just received yesterday so iI can&#x27;t rate it yet</li>
    <li> Returned, cannot compare to my old, still going Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Does a decent job shaving.  Bought this to replace a 10 plus year old model.  Mine did not come with a travel case.  One thing that annoys me is the plastic cover does not stay on well at all and always comes off easy, so your razor heads could get nicked more easily in storage.  I end up putting the plastic cap on, then putting the whole razor head first into a long sock.  Works pretty good for travel.  Charge seems last quite a while.</li>
    <li> trimmer broke within 2 weeks, have to return , very disapointed being it is a Norelco, will order Norelco again, but different model</li>
    <li> I had a higher end Norelco for several years and replaced it with this model when the older one stopped working, apparently because of a problem with the switch.  The older one - which was near the top of the line about 6-7 years ago sounded much smoother than this one and had more &amp;#34;features.&amp;#34;  But despite sounding cheaper, this one shaves just as well (it uses the same blade) - so if it lasts I will be pleased.  I wish my older one had a better switch, because the rest of it was solid and seemed like it would run forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated it 4 stars only because it does not seem like as high a quality razor as my old one, but the old one cost 4 times as much, so this one will be a much better value if it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On value for the money I would give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for about 6 months now.</li>
    <li> I like this item but power cord is missing. Please send it to me or I will return it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Battery life is good.  Only minor problem I see is when it&#x27;s out of power, it doesn&#x27;t slow down, it just stops. The cut is comfortable.  Just works real well.  I like the washable feature too.</li>
    <li> I Have been using this razor since Christmas and it is doing a great job. Very close shave and running off the orginal battery charge. This razor is very quite and very light. Also very easy to clean and maintain.</li>
    <li> We bought this for my father in law after his stroke to allow him to shave himself.  He wonders why he hasn&#x27;t used an electric razor sooner.</li>
    <li> The razor is a good middle of the road model (in terms of expense and features), not to expensive and after several weeks of use it cuts close with no burn.  I purchased one for my father.  Holds charge well.  I like the fact that it has a plug charge cord as opposed to setting in a base for charging, the base type charge models that I have had in the past were a pain to carry on trips, being two seperate items.</li>
    <li> I have used regular razors (mach 3) since I started shaving but recently switched to this one. I must say the shave is about 98% as close as a razor, but without the hassle of shaving cream. I have sensitive face skin and usually would only shave every 7 days with a razor but with this I shave every 3 days now.</li>
    <li> it is a bit different to hold,but will get used it,nice to have sharp blades again,,,,battery lasts for a long time,</li>
    <li> no comment -- I don&#x27;t really want to get into the &#x27;review&#x27; business. So, please don&#x27;t bother me with this stuff.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and leaves my face very smooth. Best electric razor I&#x27;ve owned during 25 years of shaving.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco Razors for ever. They have done something to the new shaving head that works extremely well for me. My wife said the other day that I now have a better shave a day later than I had before immediately after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also found the ability to simply wash the shaver, as per instructions, is a wonderful way to keep it clean. The battery feature is also convenient. I had to change the cord on my previous razor after several years of use. That is not going to happen with this one.</li>
    <li> it works very well !! good design!! ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha</li>
    <li> I was disappointed even before it arrived because it went on sale for almost ten dollars less than what I paid for it right after I ordered it. It arrived promptly and in good condition. I don&#x27;t think it shaves very well. This is the second shaver I have bought now. I will continue my search.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 17 years old son on Blackfriday deal. After received it my husband tried, he likes it too, will order 2nd one.</li>
    <li> New style shaving head is extremely comfortable, and easily trims around my beard and mustache. Zero skin irritation on throat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for years.  I have owned two corded and 1 cordless before this razor.  All Norelcos work about the same.  Since they work on the same principal there can&#x27;t be a lot of improvements.  The Batteries are better and I&#x27;m sure the shaving heads are improved.  I ordered this model because I didn&#x27;t want to pay for bells and whistles.  I received this shaver and have been using it for about 3 months.  I just plugged it in today for the second charge.  That makes it lasting about 6 weeks on a charge.  It is quite and does a good job shaving.  In short, it&#x27;s what I expected.</li>
    <li> I liked is rotary heads and so looked for a similar product. I like that after charging/recharging I can have 40 minutes if shaving without using the cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the Norelco shaves close whether I shave every day , every other day or every third day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend that anyone boy this Model of Norelcp.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as a christmas gift. He was very happy and told me that he loves this.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the performance of razor. This is the 4th I have owned, the previous 3 still working fine, one of them over twenty years, two over 10. Norelco/Philips is a guaranteed good purchase</li>
    <li> This is my third Norelco razor; I received my first one as an inheritance in 1997.  I liked the feel of it in my hand, it&#x27;s light weight, and the closeness of the shave.  It finally reached the point where it would not recharge , so I purchased a new one in early 2003.  My wife bought this one for me for Christmas 2012, as my then  current one was no longer holding a charge very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PT730 is even lighter than the earlier ones - and much quieter.  It provides a very satisfactory shave.  I have only had to recharge it once since Christmas, which is very convenient - especially if you are traveling.</li>
    <li> My husband said the blades were duller than his old razor.  However, I find it works great on my legs!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this shaver.  A long time ago I had Norelco, switched to Remington, then wanted to get the Remington SR9130 which had great reviews but it is not available anymore, so I tried one of the Remington Rn shavers with swivel head but it was very cheap and I took it back.  Glad I found this shaver.  Great price on Amazon.  I am thinking of buying another to keep for later since a new one is not much more than a new set of blades!</li>
    <li> very good quality product for decent price.......will recommend for anyone......very handy to use.....but detail shaving not perfect like razor....nice product anyway.....</li>
    <li> The triple blades do not give a very smooth cut for me, I have very thin hair and shave Q 2 days. The one thing I do like is the trimmer on the back, but do wish it produced a more quality shave to my beard area.</li>
    <li> In general, it is a nice razor. I like the big razor but it is not as sharp as I think.</li>
    <li> Super item, just runs and runs and runs, great shave every time!!</li>
    <li> I have had my PT730 for 3 years now. Today (4-18-14) I took this thing completely apart, and cleaned everything inside. Now it works like a brand new one!! Please try this before you buy new blades. What a  difference...</li>
    <li> not sure if all electric razors do it but this one is pretty bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also seems like blade is sort of soft.</li>
    <li> Gives excellent shave;  provides a close shave with a minimum amount of noise.  The heads clean easily by running them under the water.</li>
    <li> Old razor bit the fdust.  Likewise, was a Norelco, but with more bells and whistles.  This one is very functional and affordable.</li>
    <li> The title says it all. I have used Norelcos my entire life because they work so well. My last one wasn&#x27;t cutting too well, but I had not replaced the heads in many years. Duh! I got new heads for the old razor and now have two good Norelcos.</li>
    <li> I have been a satisfied user of Norelco razors for years (decades).  I bought this one in July 2012, admittedly not from Amazon.  It didn&#x27;t feel quite as sturdy and substantial as previous models, but was OK.  Cleaning with water was a new and positive experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the power switch failed after 10 months.  I was pleasantly surprised by the warranty replacement process, but the power switch on the replacement failed after 8 or nine months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could have just been unlucky twice, but I consider the quality of this model, especially the power switch, to be questionable.</li>
    <li> It is a decent, though not superb, razor...probably overpriced. However the pop up trimmer is great for sideburns and it is very easy to clean. It also holds a charge for many shaves.</li>
    <li> Bought this after I got sick and tired of using a two bladed razor. Clean shave, works well, and great battery life - can&#x27;t complain!</li>
    <li> Great Product and a great value.  Having previously owned a Noreleco - it performed as I expected it would.  I am always happy to recommend them to all!</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a Birthday gift for my father who is blind.  He has had problems in the past with batteries not holding up, so the fact this has a Li ion battery was a big plus.  Seems well constructed.  Controls are simple to use, which is a plus for my father who is blind.  Cord was a little difficult to get to stay plugged into razor at first, but seems to be getting easier over time.  Compact wall wart charger is convenient in that it has a small foot print and doesn&#x27;t interfere with plugin air freshener where it is usually used.</li>
    <li> Wonderful razor, cuts close, with less irritation. I was nervous about rinsing out the razor under the faucet, to clean it. No problems and being able to rinse the razor makes cleaning enjoyable and fast.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor when my old Norelco was stolen at the YMCA.  It works great - nothing fancy, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> The product does everything the packaging (and friends) said it would do, but as a life-long manual shaver, I&#x27;m still getting used to the switch to electric shaving.  It&#x27;s not as close a shave as I&#x27;m used to, but it&#x27;s a lot easier - and no more nicks!  Love that I can just rinse the shaver when I&#x27;m done and let it air dry.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;  wireless,&lt;br /&gt;  nice flexible shave head&lt;br /&gt;  very quite shaving&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;  it takes more slower passes to shave cleanly&lt;br /&gt;  (probably due to fewer blades per shave head)&lt;br /&gt;  slower blade rotation seems to pull hair but because there are fewer blades per head, pulling up to cut with the&lt;br /&gt;  following blade doesn&#x27;t happen.</li>
    <li> This razor is absolutely fantastic. Very quiet and the charge lasts for about three weeks. I absolutely love my new razor.</li>
    <li> Steer clear of this razor!  The PT730 delivers a nice shave.  I like having the trimmer for my facial hair and ears.  It&#x27;s reasonably quiet, holds the charge well, and alerts you to both a low battery and when the unit is fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is the problem.  You may as well detach the head from the body to clean it as you will no doubt push it off when you attempt to set the individual razor sets into the head.  There are 2 little notches that must line up.  Get one, move on to the next, and as I continue to fail I also knock out any I had already seated and have had to start over.  It&#x27;s annoying.</li>
    <li> Can feel the hair tug on my skin...</li>
    <li> Worked as advertised.</li>
    <li> I had an old Norelco that wasn&#x27;t working very well any more. I replaced it with this new one and am very satisfied. It gives a quick and clean shave.</li>
    <li> All is well but why not design to accept a USB charger? It&#x27;s a minor complaint but it would be great if I didn&#x27;t have to bring another charger when travelling and untangle extra wires when I get there.</li>
    <li> This razor is everything I expected. smooth shave with no irritation.I  don&#x27;t think it can be beat for thr price.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Gives a close shave, and is easy to clean. Head assembly is easy to remove as a single unit or it simply rotates up 90 degrees.</li>
    <li> Relative close  shave for an electric razor.  The charge seems to hold very well and meet or exceed the advertised claims.  Easy to clean the heads, and it is very quiet (for those who may be sleeping while you are shaving).  Very happy with my purchase so far.  These comments and recommendations are based on one month of ownership and use.</li>
    <li> While it takes little while longer to shave with this razor than it does your average non-electric razor, the experience is second to none. It is definitely a safer way to shave, not once did I cut myself. It is also radically easier to trim and style sideburns, neck hair, beards, or any hair you may find on your body. If you enjoy collecting hair for whatever your hearts desire, the Powertouch stores all shavings behind the razor. If your are not a hair collector, cleaning up the hair can be quite tedious. Everything from the ergonomic shape to the long battery life makes this razor one of a kind. I love this razor!</li>
    <li> Razor performs good, but after only 4 months, the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge ! So not happy with the product !!!</li>
    <li> mY Husband had an electric razor of another brand, but he was not happy, he bought this Norelco and finds that it was just&lt;br /&gt;what he needed.</li>
    <li> Very good razor, good value for the price.</li>
    <li> Seemed well constructed and there were no bad surprises....but just didn&#x27;t work well on my face. Not sure why</li>
    <li> Bought one for my husbands friend once he saw my husbands razor and what I sa saved on it</li>
    <li> I am a long-time Norelco user but I have to agree with the other one star ratings. This razor is junk. It does not cut the beard; it pulls hairs out.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s practically new. What a disappointment!!</li>
    <li> It gives a close shave on my very tough beard. But I also recommend that you use the Williams Brand &#x27;Lectric Shave (sold also by Amazon).You will have to experiment with the &#x27;Lectric Shave liquid to see how long to leave it on your face before starting to shave. Only in the 1970&#x27;s did Williams advertise that you are supposed to let the liquid dry slightly before starting to shave. The reason is that the evaporating liquid makes your beard &#x27;stand&#x27; up&#x27;. I don&#x27;t know why they stopped telling this in their ads. But you are not supposed to splash it on and start shaving right away..(I hope this helps).</li>
    <li> Best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> My previous razor is the Norelco is the 8240XL. I believe the blades in the8240XL are the original, but it is possible I put in different than the original. It has three circular rows of lift and cut blades in each of the three round heads. My PT730 only has one row of blades on the outer edge of the cutting head. It does not cut as close as my 8240XL. I am disappointed with the lack of closeness when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I have owned several Norelco Razors, they are better than any others I have tried.</li>
    <li> My husband liked it very much. Did a good job and cleans nicely.</li>
    <li> Very good, Philips razor are for ever</li>
    <li> Got this for my 15 year old who refused to shave on a consistent basis and had this freaky mustache taking over.  With this &amp;#34;toy&amp;#34; he is well groomed all the time!  Thank you Norelco!</li>
    <li> My last Norelco which I purchased about 27 years ago and been using faithfully has just died.  So it I approached this purchase with the highest level of concern because was afraid that it would not live up to my expectation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this product.  I decided on this model instead of the more expensive ones because I needed a shaver, that was all, so the models with the interchanging heads our useable in water seemed as unnecessary for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shaves very well, and I believe in the 1 week that I have been using it, better than my old model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like that it is cordless, but for me that was not a requirement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape and contour feels very comfortable on your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little getting used to with cleaning it.  I am very dexterous, and believe if you do not have nimble fingers then cleaning the heads might be a chore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very, very glad that my model was made in Netherlands because the models that I saw in sale in the stores from Norelco said they were made in China</li>
    <li> I think 3 stars is a bit much, maybe 2.5.  You get what you pay for and since I&#x27;m on a slimmer budget than years pass I went for an economical replacement.  I should have spent the extra money and now it&#x27;s pass the 2 week return grace period.  This shaver takes almost twice the time to do the job than my previous Norelco.  It&#x27;ll get replaced once the funding improves.</li>
    <li> This razor performed up to (barely) the earlier one I had.</li>
    <li> Much better than the lower price units as far as providing a close non &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; shave. Apparently the actual cutting heads &amp;#34;are&amp;#34; different and will pay very close attention to this in the future. Believe the PT730 is the lowest price unit with the better blades. Took a couple of shaves for the unit to really &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; out, now running very smooth, have not had a shave this close in a while.</li>
    <li> not as good as a blade razor.</li>
    <li> Replaced my old Norelco w/ this &amp; am pleased w/ performance.</li>
    <li> Lighter than older models but shaves very clean and is very easy to clear. Charge is long-lasting.  Great buy!!</li>
    <li> Shaving ability was a disappointment</li>
    <li> Great design and features for price.</li>
    <li> My husband is very pleased with this shaver.  A great value and excellent product.</li>
    <li> excellent purchase and quick delivery</li>
    <li> Light weight, good shave, fine trimmer, low price.&lt;br /&gt;Was pleasantly surprised at the amount of usage between charges.&lt;br /&gt;Very good value.</li>
    <li> Given as a gift - but comments were very positive.  As always, Amazon makes it easy to shop between different models, and the reviewing comments add credence to your buy.</li>
    <li> Not the best shaver.. It just gets stubble, really. If you have 1/8 inch hair it will take FOREVER to get all your hairs. If you shave a lot, this product is probably for you since it gets small hairs pretty well. It still takes way longer than a wet shave.</li>
    <li> I purchased a cheaper Phlips Norelco several years ago at a Walmart store in Salt Lake, city UT.  I used it for at least 5 years until it would no longer recharge.  The actual shave was a close cut smooth shave.  I can still shave with it plugged in with the electric power plug and it continues to shave my face gently and close cut.  I have discarded the serial number but it cost around $60.  The Philips Norelco PT730/41 shaver 3500 I purchased above gives a rough shave that scratches my face and not does not give the close shave my old razor gives.  both shaving heads look exactly the same with 3 circular blades.  I have always loved the Philips Norelco  shaver and have purchased several of them prior to these two all but the current shaver gave smooth close cut shaves.</li>
    <li> it is better than a normal razor, no blood after shaving anymore</li>
    <li> This Norelco is really a great razor, have not had any problems with it.</li>
    <li> Great Razor! Great Price!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday present to replace his very very old used-up electric shaver. He said he really likes this shaver and that it does a very close shave. He said it takes longer to trim but it&#x27;s smoother and a much cleaner shave. I definitely feel the difference when we kiss. His face no longer hurts my face!</li>
    <li> I  very pleased with the quality of this razor.  I do not have very thick facial hair, so I cannot say how it would work for you guys that do.  I have always owned a Norelco and am glad that I purchased this one after my previous razor no longer held a charge after 5 years.</li>
    <li> My son really likes his shaver.</li>
    <li> dosnt shave small hair</li>
    <li> Nice close shave without pulling.  I bought this for my dad who is 100 years old and he loves it, says it gives him a good shave and is easy to use and empty.</li>
    <li> Philips shavers are the best money can buy.</li>
    <li> Works just fine.  Really should come with a carrying case for travel and storage.  First new razor I have purchased in many years and I am satisified.</li>
    <li> I had been set against electric razors for a while; I had a Braun long ago, and it never did a good job.  Having grown tired of my twice-weekly routine of shaving gel and razor blades, I decided to give electrics another shot, but to go with the triple foil design Norelco is known for, rather than the &amp;#34;bar&amp;#34; approach that Braun uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I like it a lot.  I am still in the adjustment phase, where my face is adapting to the change in techniques, but I can see a small improvement almost weekly now.  Its still far from the smoothness I could get with a Mach3 Turbo shaving against the grain, but it takes 3 minutes to shave each morning, rather than 10, and the texture it leaves behind isn&#x27;t objectionable, even to my picky spouse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually I&#x27;d like to upgrade to a wet/dry model, but for now, this is a small investment I don&#x27;t regret making.</li>
    <li> Good value for the money.  Works well.  Replaced another Norelco I had for years.  Like the changes made in how the razor is cleaned and charged.  Hope this one is as long lasting as my last one. (This review is per my husband.  I have not used the razor)</li>
    <li> I gave this to my husband for Xmas because he was always putting off shaving.  He loves it and used it regularly.</li>
    <li> afeitadora de alta calidad, bastante comoda para usar, efectiva en el afeitado, llego en el tiempo estimado y en optimas condiciones</li>
    <li> I have owned several electric razors - and several Phillips Norelco razors - over many years.  In my experience, I have found the Philips Norelco brand to be the most reliable, and offer the closest shave.  I bought this razor several months ago and was pleasantly surprised at the quality, feel, and performance of it.  This one is reasonable priced and a great value.  No need to jump to the next highest price range.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to hold a charge for more than 1 use on my legs.  I have to add more words in order to submit this review...silly.</li>
    <li> Review from my husband:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have stayed away from electric razors for most of my life.  I have always preferred using a normal razor.  My wife bought this for me and I really like it.  My best electric razor experience.  Provides a very close shave and holds charge for long time.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This razor is awesome! I received it on 1/3/13, promptly charged it and started using it the next day. The motor is quiet (at least compared to the Remington I previously had) and runs smoothly. The instructions say to use it at least 3 weeks to allow your face to get used to it, but I got a close shave from the start. The rechargeable battery is supposed to last for 40 minutes or so. I was expecting to have to recharge at the end of week 2 or during week 3 of use, but the indicator light never came on. Weeks 4, 5, 6 and 7 all passed, allowing me to shave every morning (I never missed a day) without the battery dying. Here I am in week 8 and the orange recharge light finally came on this morning. That is amazing! I&#x27;ve had several electric razors over the years, and none of them held a charge this long. I am truly impressed. I have no complaints at all!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for only a few weeks, but it does a better job than any previous shaver I&#x27;ve used over the past 60 years. It requires minimum passes over the same area, is very quiet, has a standard trimmer, is comfortable to hold, and is easy to rinse out after each use. I had worried about skin irritation, but this shaver has been gentle on my skin. I had been a nearly life-long Remington user, switched to Braun after a series of disappointments (screens that kept vibrating out of position), and then gave up Braun after another series of disappointments (similar problem in one case, highly inefficient performance in another case). If my new Norelco holds up, I&#x27;ll be hooked on it.</li>
    <li> Works great and holds charge for over a week so you can travel without charging on weekly trips. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I had a Norelco electric shaver model # 950srx that i bought in 06/90 &amp; have vever replaced the heads. I use it about 4 days a wk, &amp; then i use a gillette fusion in between.I purchased this new pt730/41 on 02/22 after having a heart valve replaced on 01/08/13. I called Phillips about a wk after i had it &amp; they said they would send me new replacement heads because that was the problem. They sent me a set of HQ9 heads to replace the HQ8 heads, but it still doesn&#x27;t shave very good. You still have a stubble of a beard left. I can still use my old 950SRX a get a much better shave. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this model as it is bad. THey said that they will send me a return slip, but you must pay the frt. I paid almost $ 6.00 in frt to get this &amp; now i have to pay frt to return it. My advice is don&#x27;t buy. I am 79 yrs old &amp; have used Electric shavers since I was in the Korean War, but they were Remington then SO DON&#x27;T BUY</li>
    <li> They did something different. It doesn&#x27;t chaff the skin like the old models. Good power, holds a charge really good.</li>
    <li> This razor had all the features I was looking for and is working well thus far.  I was satisfied with the price I paid and believe it was a good price for this particular razor.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants a Norelco razor.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Much better than my old Norelco.  This one has a battery that lasts for more than 2 weeks worth of shaving.</li>
    <li> Love it, much beter than the cheap ones !  Quality is got it´s price and this model´s price is just right.  Nice &amp; smooth shaves, I have a little irritation but the same happened with the Gillete shaver and the Norelco Manual clearly states that you have to train your skin for 2 weeks at least to experience the best results and to adapt your skin to this new way of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spare head blades model &amp;#34;Q8&amp;#34;, change every year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice, good price, well built, not noisy &amp; perfect results.  Love it &amp; will recommend it to anyone !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d doesn&#x27;t sound especially powerful but it gets the job done.  I don&#x27;t know what top of the line is for shaving close but this one does a nice job.  Also quite easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I suppose there is no perfect electric shaver.  But his one works remarkably well.  It is so quiet that I can actually hear it cutting my whiskers -- a pleasant change from my 10 year old Braun.  I recommend it as the best I could find in numerous web sites and consumer reports/reviews. In sum, I&#x27;m very pleased and think you will be too.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco electric razors for many years. This model is the best I have owned for the modest cost. Very quiet, shaves close, and cleans very easily. Just rinse the head and blade under the faucet lightly dry with a cloth. Great razor for the money. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Esta fue una maravillosa compra, mi esposo le pudo decir adios al fastidio de estar comprando hojillas. La cara le queda suavecita. La recomiendo ampliamente</li>
    <li> My husband loves his new razor. He says it gives him a close, comfortable shave. The price was also reasonable.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy having this available, I like the smooth shave, the ease of use, and the easy way to clean it.</li>
    <li> Traded in for Remington.  It is not as close a shave, but is more comfortable.  If you shave less than every day this is better.</li>
    <li> I have owned Norelco shavers for several years and use Gillett blades as well.  When I first used this new unit, the slower motor compared with the old Norelco&#x27;s made me very suspect of the shaving ability.  But after first use, the shaving results were great and makes me wonder why the old shavers ran so fast?</li>
    <li> This product is for my elderly uncle (93 yrs).  He finds it easy to use and his face not only looks great, but feels like silk, every time he uses it.</li>
    <li> Never fails, cuts very well, smooth.. The charge lasts moré THan a week.. Cleans easy, i prefer most THan a razor blade</li>
    <li> I inherited my late Dad&#x27;s Norelco when he passed in spring 2000 which was only a few months old at the time. Bought replacement blades in 2009 for around $27 and now they go for $70 for this model. The old shaver still worked good but needed new blades so it was a no brainer to buy this one @ $49.95 minus a $5 off coupon &#x3D; $44.95 + CA tax and free shipping. Received in 2 days and I have to say...it works really great! It gave me the closes electric shave I have had in years and much better than a blade and foam shave. It is made in the Netherlands and not China which for me I thought was kinda nice for a change. Good product!</li>
    <li> So far so good. Smooth and close shave . Well worth worth the price.Should add a charging stand and cover for the razor.</li>
    <li> The Phillips electric shaver deserves al the positive reviews. I have been using my Phillips Norelco for two months. It is easy to keep clean and recharges overnight.</li>
    <li> I received the worst customer service of my life! I got a condescending person who said she would not honor my warranty on a Norelco Shaver, because the model number was not there. I gave her the serial number, faxed a receipt, and it was within the warranty period. I asked to speak to a supervisor, but she put me on revenge hold. I called back and got another person, but the same bad attitude and no solution. I offered to pay the shipping to them, so they could identify the model, but they said they don&#x27;t allow that. What did I do wrong, other than buy a Norelco??</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this Razor. The plastic cover protecting the blades was broken. It charged up promptly and is extremely quiet but rather than cutting the beard, ir feels more like they are being ripped out, especially in the neck area. The book says that you might experience this initially but when you get use to it, it won&#x27;t bother you any more. Also, the blades are not adjustable as in past Norelco products. I will think twice before purchasing a like unit in the future.</li>
    <li> Bought on a friends recommendation far exceeded my expectations! Great product and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Really quiet close shave.Comfortable smooth powerful. It does have a slow charge battery but for the price its OK.</li>
    <li> I had a Braun before and this gives a closer and smoother shave.</li>
    <li> Easy to clean. Great quality for the price. Good shave for an electric razor.</li>
    <li> The family member I bought this for loves this razor.  He says it shaves great and the battery lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought Norelco items all my life and never have been disappointed with an item ever.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase this product.  While the majority of the reviews were good, there were several that complained of being too weak, or not providing for a close enough shave.  My experience has been quite different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the same Norelco 5801XL for probably about 20 years now!  I was still not ready to replace this thing since it has been working so good, but when I found out recently that the replacement heads were very hard to find and about 1/2 the cost of a new razor, I gave in and decided to buy a new one.  This was the one I settled on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it every day for two weeks now on a single charge, with no notable decrease in speed.  While it may give the illusion of having less power than the old 5801XL I&#x27;ve been using, probably because it is so much quieter, it gives me an even closer shave than the 5801XL in about the same amount of time.  There is also a notable difference in how much better it handles the thicker/more stubborn hairs.  I&#x27;m guessing that has a lot to do with the new head design allowing for different size hairs.  I would constantly have to use the hair trimmer accessory with the 5801XL to get those hairs, but have so for not had to do it with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like how much easier it is to clean the head and also the ability to wash it under running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, as compared to the 5801XL that I have been so happy with over the years, I think this one is definitely a step up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/17/2013: With daily use from a full charge, the battery lasted a good two months!  Very impressive.  It&#x27;s amazing how much better these Lithium Ion batteries are compared to the old ones.</li>
    <li> It works well and cleans easily.&lt;br /&gt;So far no problems.&lt;br /&gt;This is my fourth updated Norelco razor,&lt;br /&gt;they all did the job.</li>
    <li> First time using an electric shaver and will do so from now on. I recommend it for a first time user like myself.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A VERY GOOD SHAVER.  IT HOLDS A CHARGE FOR QUITE A WHILE.  I DON&#x27;T USE IT ON MY BEARD. I USE IT TO SHAVE MY HEAD.  NOT ALOT OF HAIR ON TOP BUT STILL PRETTY THICK AROUND THE SIDES AND BACK..DOESN&#x27;T LOOK GOOD SO I SHAVE IT ALL OFF. WORKS GREAT.&lt;br /&gt;OK 4.26.2014 STILL WORKS GREAT.  JUST REPLACE THE BLADES WHEN NECESSARY</li>
    <li> I do not get a very close shave with this and I do not have a very thick facial hair. I usually have to use shaving cream and and regular razor to finish the job properly.</li>
    <li> Does the job I expected of a Norelco. This replaced another Norelco purchased several years ago that no longer held a charge. I&#x27;ve had this Norelco since Nov. 24th and haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet, so using it daily, I can say it&#x27;s holding a charge for over a month.</li>
    <li> I like it very much, and send it to father-low as a gift. surly, it is wonderful with&lt;br /&gt;its price!</li>
    <li> great price  of 30 and alot closer shave than my old one , holds charge long time has better info on lite when needs chargeing.</li>
    <li> This shaver absolutely refused to cut about 1/4 of the hairs on my beard, mainly on my neck. I would go over the same spot over and over... and over... By the time I would give up on the Norelco, my neck was irritated and dotted with small nicks. Then I would have to follow up with a razor- which kinda defeats the whole purpose of using an electric shaver. Norelco recommends an \\&quot;adjustment period\\&quot; of 3 weeks to get used to this sort of misery, but it&#x27;s been 2 weeks and I&#x27;m done with this thing. Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> I use this razor everyday, very fashionable, water proof, I charge it once a week and lasts for the whole week. It does so much that I can&#x27;t really think of any reason to buy any of the higher up models...</li>
    <li> I bought for my 17 son and he loves ! Charges well and no more worries about him cutting himself as he doesnt have a full beard but def needs a shave everyday ! Easy and simple...great quality !</li>
    <li> Still great for a nice quiet, pain-free cosmetic shave, as long as you are not planning on kissing anyone for more than a fraction of a second.</li>
    <li> I like the quiet operation and the ability to rinse the heads for cleaning each day.  Overall a great value.</li>
    <li> It could cut closer and have a more accurate description, other than that i guess it does alright for $50</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for most of my life. When my last one died, I was dismayed with the poor reviews the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; Senso Touch line was receiving on Amazon and other sources. As a result, I opted for the Powertouch that closely resembled my previous purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy, was I wrong!  This shaver is nothing like my last shaver.  The rechargeable batteries are cheap, low capacity versions.  The motor is light weight, but not because it&#x27;s efficient.  It&#x27;s a cheesy, low speed and low torque Asian boat (Chinese junk), that can barely make it through my relatively mild beard.  And forget about getting a close shave... if you like the night life, you&#x27;re going to have to shave twice a day with this baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you&#x27;re someone who barely needs to shave and is looking for a cheap shaver, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Norelco makes the best razors and this is a really good one gives me close shaves and hold a charge for an acceptable amount of time I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who wants a basic shaver</li>
    <li> The razor is for my husband, who reports that it shaves quickly and quietly.  He has had Norelco razors before and requested this particular one.</li>
    <li> Closer shave than my 4 year old model. Holds a charge for weeks. I would recommend this item. quality built.</li>
    <li> The Norelco PT730 is a personal and powerful shave that does the job right.  Easy to clean. Long lasting battery power. I can shave anywhere without a mirror although a mirror helps you see places you missed. The pull out trimmer is a plus as it help keep those sideburns trim.</li>
    <li> The razor replaced one that I had for 12 years.  On that one the heads began to wear through finally.  I went on line for new heads and found them for $42.50.  A quick look at this model for $49 made me decide to buy the new one.  It shaves real well and charges quickly (about once every 3 weeks even as I use it daily).  This razor is also much quieter and the cover over the heads stays on better than my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a good purchase for me.</li>
    <li> Will not give the complete shave, some hairs will be there even after multiple tries and stopped using this when started to bleed.  One good part is that, was able to return and got refund.</li>
    <li> Pros: Lightweight, easy to clean, charge lasts a long time, easy and quick charging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Loses some cutting power when battery starts to get low&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Thoughts: This is a very solid Razor, and I&#x27;m very happy I was able to snag it on sale. Only wish it came with a dock.</li>
    <li> Great razor works great, good close shave. Anyone looking for a good razor this is the one. Great price and value.</li>
    <li> I have not used and electric razor in many years and I&#x27;m glad that I bought this one. It does give a smooth shave, after the skin gets use to it. I have used an aftershave on the skin especially that seems sensitive on the neck and after a couple of weeks it has replaced my non-powered razor.</li>
    <li> For the price, an outstanding shaver. Holds its charge for two weeks shaving, cuts close, and is very comfortable to use. This is my first electric shaver, after using blades for 50 years, and I should have switched 49 years ago. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been burned trying to find a shaver these days that works well like the old days when they made them well and actually cut and was self sharping!! The last few shavers I&#x27;ve had didn&#x27;t cut well and hurt to shave with of how it would pull your hairs before cutting them. This shaver works as nice as all the reviews say.  A friend tried this model first before I was willing to try it, after reporting back that he was impressed with the nice shave it gives and features of this shaver.... I ordered one too!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have much issue switching from a straight razor to electric. The battery doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as others have said but I don&#x27;t mind that much.</li>
    <li> This is my third Norelco shaver and is satisfactory. It gets the job done with a minimum of ingrown whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;I think the shaver heads should last more than one year before replacement.</li>
    <li> This is my first Norelco product is really good. I was looking something inexpensive for no buy razors all months and this one give me a  smooth shave  now i say no more razors</li>
    <li> Met and exceeds my expectations. Works a long time (3 weeks so far) on one charge. I replaced an older model with this one.</li>
    <li> This was disappointing. The first time I used this razor it was great, it felt like I almost wasn&#x27;t shaving at all. After several more uses, that&#x27;ll exactly what was happening. I now get a five o&#x27;clock shadow every day, and I&#x27;m spending more and more time each morning shaving to try to get a close shave. I do not recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I needed a new shaver that would work and shave good... this one does!!  They don&#x27;t build them like they used to but this one comes closer.  Hope it last longer than the other crap electric shaver I had!! Quiet, smooth, and works when plugged in after battery goes dead, which is a plus... my other one wouldn&#x27;t work until the battery charged up again even when plugged in... how stupid was that!  They did it right on this one.</li>
    <li> My old Norelco would give me a shave for 2+ weeks before needing a charge. This one will last a week at most. Shaving head cover clips broke the second week I had it, so now cover will not stay on when not in use. Takes almost 24 hours to recharge the battery. General construction is of much lighter weight than older models. Trimmer is awkward to use compared to older model too.  In general it works OK, but very disappointing for someone that has used Norelco shavers for 30 years</li>
    <li> Replaced my old one and I wanted to be sure I got a very good one. This is just what I was looking for, sturdy, works well, good battery, looks good.</li>
    <li> The razor turns slowly pulling whiskers and taking a long time to complete a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sending it back.</li>
    <li> I have used this shaver for over a year and have been well satisfied.  My prior shavers have been other brands and I had not given Norelco a chance.  I have a new grandson-in-law and he was admiring my shaver and thus this additional new gift purchase.  It give a consistent close shave with no lubricant on the face as well as with shaving cream, as well as with the electric shaver blue liquid.  I have always appreciated a shaver that can be washed under the faucet and this work well.  Others that also have revolving blades built up debris that never seems to wash away without a stiff brushing, not so with this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 7/12/14&lt;br /&gt;I wrote the above review prior to receiving new blades for my old shaver.  Now I thoroughly regret the lavish praise. Not because of the shave I still get but because of the Manufacturer.  I bought here on Amazon HQ8 blades as indicated on the the shaver. However, the branded Norelco HQ8 did not fit the shaver, even after an hour of twisting and turning the blade units each and every way. The solution was to remove the actual blade from its head cover and insert into the original covers. What they sold me was not what was pictured on Amazon and not HQ8 replacement units that would fit the shaver.  I now regret having given five stars.  So, now I reduce it to two stars because you cannot replace the blades without a hassle.</li>
    <li> This razor does a great job, not as close as my old razor but a lot easier for me to use.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Serves it&#x27;s purpose. Gives a close shave just wish it wold have come with a case</li>
    <li> Works well, but speed is a little slower than my old Norelco. Also, on/off button is placed such that it is too easy to come on when just picking the razor up, and the angular shape is such that it wants to roll to one side when you lay it down on its backside. Those minor nits aside, its a good razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Dick, Pauline&#x27;s husband. I ordered it and am the one using it. I like it fine. It replaced my 13 year old Braun, which probably needed a new head, but that was half the price of the Norelco I bought. I had another Norelco many years ago.&lt;br /&gt; The new one does a better job of cutting whiskers under my chin and on my neck. So far, so good. It has been 24 days since I got it, and it is still on the first charge. I&#x27;m OK with that. It is also quieter than I expected. That also is OK.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son and he loves it. It saves him time and it hasn&#x27;t harmed his skin.</li>
    <li> Not a bad razor works pretty well. However, the battery didn&#x27;t even last a year. I called Norelco and they sent me a new body.  That one didn&#x27;t even last as long as the original.  I can&#x27;t believe in this day and age that they cannot engineer a longer lasting battery.</li>
    <li> This is a terrible razor.  I would not recommend it to anyone.  I tried shaving with this razor and it takes forever.  I am used to a safety razor and I bought this to save some time.  It is not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t work on longer hairs. Only works on very short stubble</li>
    <li> Very good product and delivered on time.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor for the price. This is not as easy to use as the Norelco Architect but head replacements for the Architect are prohibitive. Those head replacements are as much as this entire razor.</li>
    <li> razor gives a close shave and cleans easily</li>
    <li> Great shaver.  Quiet!</li>
    <li> Gives a very close shave but requires going over areas repeatedly.  I like it because it is cheap. I bought this for my son. My older electric razor like this lasted about 14 years and is still going strong.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used electrics (either Norelco or Remington).  This is a nice, light, decent shaver with really great battery life that is ideal for home or travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that this unit uses a wall &amp;#34;wart&amp;#34; charging adapter and the older ones had the adapter built in to the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s a great shaver.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews on different shavers and bought this one. the price was very inexpensive, but it gives a very close shave very easily even on my tough beard. Very well made. Easy to cleanup and the battery holds several long shaves. The best deal in town, I don&#x27;t know why anyone would spend anymore money.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad who&#x27;s in a nursing home.  It works pretty well.  I do have a problem keeping the charging cord from falling out.  I like to keep it plugged so that it stays charged when I&#x27;m not there.  I like that you can shave with it plugged in.  His last Norelco had to be unplugged before using and he didn&#x27;t always remember that.  For the price I think this is a pretty good razor..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had the shaver for a month.  So far it shaves smoothly and quick.  It&#x27;s not perfect but it&#x27;s very good.</li>
    <li> I like the feel and weight of this shaver.  Get about a week off of one charge.  A little hard to clean but it is washable so not too bad.  A good buy.</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my husband and he is very pleased with the Norelco PT7370.  The first charge of the battery was around Jan 15, 2013 and it still is holding that charge today is Feb 11,2013.  He is also satisifed with the closeness of the shave.  He can see no falt with the razor.</li>
    <li> I recently had my old Remington shaver stolen and I needed to get a replacement. Going off of reviews here I was excited to upgrade to something better. Since I&#x27;m bald, I need to shave my head regularly in addition to shaving my face. I&#x27;ve settled on every other day as a perfect shaving schedule to avoid irritation (and because I&#x27;m too lazy to do it every day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Quality construction. The blade assembly opens and closes smoothly&lt;br /&gt;Quiet operation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Shaving takes a long time. Like, you might as well just use an actual razor. I&#x27;m guessing this is why it&#x27;s so quiet- the blades move slowly.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t charge and shave at the same time&lt;br /&gt;After only a few shaves, the blades seem to have dulled. It irritated my neck quite badly&lt;br /&gt;The shave you do get isn&#x27;t very close. This is compared to other electrics I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed. I think the blade design results in too little surface area to quickly cut through thick head (and face) hair. I&#x27;m returning this razor and going back to Remington. They seem to have more blade surface and while they&#x27;re louder, they cut through more hair more quickly and closely. Especially on my head.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver, I love it, I had a Norelco before and it lasted for many years and did and excellent shave, so that is the reason I have purchased another norelco.</li>
    <li> My husband loved this product and he&#x27;s usually pretty picky about this stuff!</li>
    <li> The machine showed up fast and works great, haven&#x27;t owned an electric razor for a long time because I like a close shave, this shaves close and comfortable and it&#x27;s rechargable and portable, if I am running late I can shave on the commute to work.</li>
    <li> I had a norelco  for 4 yrs ,It was awesome! But this new one doesn&#x27;t quite shave tight. unless you pass a spot about four times. other than that it&#x27;s a good product</li>
    <li> I almost enjoy shaving now.  It has converted a 50+ years blade man.  No more looking at this face every morn.  Can shave anywhere  I go.</li>
    <li> Of all the various models,brands,etc of electric razors that I have tryed over the years, this has so far been the only one that actually gives me a decent shave. I have a rather course and thick beard and have been thoroughly impressed with it&#x27;s performance, plus the price was something I could live with. Give it a try, like me you might be pleasantly surprised!</li>
    <li> The razor costs less than a years worth of razor blades.  Itr shaves closer and is more convenient.  I recommend this to all people who shave.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I have a tremor in both hands and when using a conventional razor I cut myself everytime I use it.&lt;br /&gt;My main complaint is that when using the shaver with an electrical power source the cord keeps falling out from the connection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like a response to my review.</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as advertised.  Great razor for the price.  It holds it&#x27;s charge a long time and is easy to clean</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.  This is a very quiet razor and has good battery life.  However, the cut is only fair.  If you&#x27;re not picky about the quality of the cut, then this razor will work for you.</li>
    <li> A very nice gift for father. It feels good when using, and convenient for cleaning. It charges very quick, around half an hour, and can be used over weeks. I don&#x27;t see the point of choosing a more expensive razor, because this one is already awesome.</li>
    <li> It works fine, no pulling.The battery last for many times. the only issue is the head cove is not stay in its place.</li>
    <li> This is the way to go for a smooth and comfortable shave!&lt;br /&gt;Outdoes even the Nono!system for removing hair electronically</li>
    <li> I have two current electric razors, both Panasonics. The ES8017 is a lower end entry unit (3 years) and the ES8249 (1.5 years) which is a higher end razor (with charging/cleaning/drying station). I have a normal beard and generally perfer an actual blade razor, but appreciate the speed and abiltity to shave without lotion an electric offers. The Panasonics do a good job on my cheeks and jaw line but struggle a bit on the neck hair, which tends to grow in different directions. I was interested to see if this Norelco would far better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the box, I noticed how light the Noreclo was. Despite the lack of heft, the build seemed good with the plastic having no stress marks or burring. It also fit together well with no noticeble defects. I charged it over night and the next morning gave it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is quiet in comparison to the panasonics, very quiet. I was a bit worried intially that it was getting not getting full power having been used to the power tool like sound and vibration from the pany&#x27;s. However once on my face it cut cleanly and quickly. It did a great job on my face and jawline. It also outperformed the panasonics on the lower neck, actually being able to cut all the hair and not leaving a scattered few. Have used it for most of the week now with no complaints and haven&#x27;t needed to recharge it. The cut is very close, I would say not quite a blade but a bit closer then the panasonics. It also does better with very short stubble then the panasonics. If I blade shave the day prior, they often have trouble picking up the stubble the next day, no such issue with the norelco. It does also have the usual flip up sideburn cutter on the back of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other then the razor and charging plug it comes only with a cleaning brush and snap on blade cover. I would have liked to have seen it ship with a soft case of some sort for travel. I will update in a few months to see if the unit continues to perform as the blades wear. If I have any concern it is as they dull it may lose performance but don&#x27;t want to prejudge. New and out of the box though it does an excellent job. I liked both my Panasonics and will still use them (one for travel and one at work) but the Noreclo suprisingly is going to replace the ES8249 at home.</li>
    <li> This razor is perfect in every way.  It is easy to use because it is so lightweight and shaped nicely.  It gives a close shave and does not irritate the skin.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as it should, have not had any problems as of yet with the razor. Easy to use and user friendly.</li>
    <li> Not much more to say... It does good work and it is easy to clean.  I like it much better than my last electric razor.</li>
    <li> I Had the XL model from 2009 and power cord had been damaged so buying new heads and power cord would have cost me around forty, so for fifty i bought this one.  What a difference in speed and shaves as close but quicker.  Very happy with purchase.  I do not use the shaver when I shower so why spend extra on feature that I do not use.  Blades are always going to give a closer shave but this gets it done quickly.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. When he is in a hurry he can take it with him in the car and shave. Maybe not a good idea but better than being on the cell phone, hopefully he doesn&#x27;t do both at the same time. If he tried that he might shave the hair in his ear and get frustrated because he is getting a buqqing sound in his phone. (Just kidding)</li>
    <li> I use it for a quick shave, sideburn trim. this my 3rd Norelco.My wife knocked the last one off the bathroom counter and broke it.It&#x27;s not possible to get any but the most elementery parts online for them. I had two Remington electric razors before that, and they weren&#x27;t very good for a close shave. If I have the time, I get a cleaner shave with a disposable razor. The battery on this model lasts better than the prior Norelco model .</li>
    <li> Razor runs fairly sluggish.  Razor requires future purchase of new heads in twelve months - never needed that before with Norelco - at least not that quickly.  No zippered carrying case included?  The cord provided, which does allow for more distance between the power source and the user is not a coiled cord, and as such is highly unmanageable for the user. Norelco can surely do better than this...faster speed - sharper blade wheels - and please do something with that terrible cord.  Charge a little more, and make a top notch product, please!</li>
    <li> Previously used the Norelco Reflex Plus 6853XL cordless since 2005.  Battery wouldn&#x27;t hold charge anymore much too soon, so I had to charge it every morning for at least 6 minutes to get a shave.  Thought it no big deal but I tired of the inability to shave right away.  This new PT730 is WAY better!  Quieter and closer shave, comfortable, cleans easily with water, and charge should last about 10 days.  Shaves a 3 day growth super easy where the other model struggled.  Very happy with this new Norelco.  FYI--previous model made in China--new model made in Netherlands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE Cinco de Mayo, 2014:  razor still performing flawlessly with original cutters [neglected to mention in original review that I have a typical Italian bred beard].  I have not had to do any thorough cleanings with taking cutters out and brushing.  No need.  Only rinsing under the faucet for nearly a year cleans it all.  So quick and easy.  This is so much better than previous Norelco cutters accumulating stubble constantly and needing 30 minutes to take apart and brush.  Honestly, I don&#x27;t know how you could get a better razor or more comfortable results than a rotary Norelco.  Even if you had to throw it away after 1 year it&#x27;s still worth $50/yr.  Thankfully, that&#x27;s not the case as new cutters are $23 here at Amazon.  Great razor!</li>
    <li> This product seems to be ok.  It feels cheap but works like it is supposed to.  No fault of the product but it cuts up my neck more then a regular straight razor does so I have switched back and no longer use this thing.</li>
    <li> Price and quality is exactly what we get here&lt;br /&gt;Price is really affordable and the quality is A+++++++ i cant believe all theses yearsi thought i was getting a good shave&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;easy to clean , you can put under water to rinse and then dry off&lt;br /&gt;Close shave as a blade&lt;br /&gt;i really recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving with a safety razor for many years and I still believe that is the closest shave you can get. I had tried some electric razors many moons ago and wasn&#x27;t all that impressed  BUT. I got tired of nicking myself as my hand isn&#x27;t as steady as it once was. I thought I&#x27;d try an electric shaver again and I&#x27;m so glad I did. This Norelco  shaver is much more quite than the older ones. Some of the reviewers have said that they think this shaver is slower. I disagree, I think it just seems that way because of how quite it is.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver does the job well and saves me a lot of time. I&#x27;m going to order another one and extra blades to have for back up.No more messy shaving lather and cuts. Norelco has made a believer out of me!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my father to use in his nursing home. They were using disposable razors and his face was suffering. This electric razor works well and now no more face burn.</li>
    <li> Does not give a close shave</li>
    <li> Finally replaced the 40-year-old Norelco.  This one&#x27;s even better. Closer shave, quiet, lightweight.  He&#x27;s good for another 40 years.</li>
    <li> I upgraded to this razor from another Notelco model when the battery could no longer retain a charge. This is, surprisingly a big upgrade from my other model. I did keep the heads replaced close to on schedule from the old model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaves quickly, and it only requires 2 - 3 passes over a certain area of the skin to remove 99% of facial hair. I like to let my facial hair grow out to a slight scruff and then I take it off, and this does a great job of giving a clean shave once every 2 - 4 days. I am actually wishing I upgraded sooner. I am very happy with this.</li>
    <li> Have had this for almost 2 years now, and replaced the blade one time already (they are available locally at most store chains).  I have very fine facial hair (mostly).  I find it works well on flat areas IE my cheeks and such.  Where this really lacks is on the edge areas of my jaw and chin, it does not cut very closely, I have to pull and spread the skin around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have issues using this product on my neck.  Even after using it for this long (no regular razors, electric only) my neck is still too sensitive for it.  It nicks the HECK out of my neck if I make too many passes trying to get the stray hairs.  It makes it worse if I pull down to flatten the skin of my neck.  It looks like I was attacked by a vicious poodle or something.  The abrasions scab up for days after.  Knowing that, and only making 1 or 2 passes, it does just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very prone to severe break outs on my chin and neck from a regular razor.  This electric very seriously minimizes that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall for my purposes, it works just fine.  For me (others may have different results) I find that my face is never smooth, it always feels a little rough.  I would think if someone had really dark hair they may have issues looking like they have a 5 o&#x27; clock shadow.  My hair is blond and some red so it doesn&#x27;t do that for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Battery is amazing, I rarely have to charge it.</li>
    <li> Very close shave for an electric razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from Norelco 9 weeks ago and it has fallen apart and broken and I can&#x27;t get any help from either  Amazon or Norelco.....&lt;br /&gt;The warranty period for Amazon is apparently over in such a short time 30 days !!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This is terrible and unacceptable for either replacement or at least help with part replacement......I will never buy another Norelco product again if&lt;br /&gt;they can&#x27;t help fix my problem!!!! I have to discard a brand new product ............outrageous!</li>
    <li> Does the job well and it doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin. Hard to find a good razor at this price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to mince words.  It runs very slowly, has one power setting and is horrible at shaving.  I would run it on parts of my face and it just couldn&#x27;t get the hair out.  I&#x27;d have to follow it up with a razor to remove the rest of the facial hair.  Whats the purpose then?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very bad and I returned it for full refund.  I always thought Norelco was a good brand, guess they&#x27;re not anymore.</li>
    <li> I have used Norfelco razors for a long timel  My last one lasted for arouind 20 years and then it fell apart.  This new one really works great.  I hope it lasts as long as the others I have had.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver with great skepticism as I have always been a blade shaver.  I was pleasantly surprised to how close a shave this will give.  The clean up is quick and simple by placing the head under the faucet.  I am able to get between 30 to 40 shaves on a single charge.  Definitely a good value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for about a month. I finally switched full time from a blade to an electric and this product was the reason. I&#x27;ve used cheaper electrics in the past but this one gave me enough closeness and comfort to make me fully abandon my Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is not as close as a blade but the convenience simply cannot be beat. I don&#x27;t have a very thick beard so be sure to take that into consideration.</li>
    <li> you can get one at the local pharmacy...so it&#x27;s just okay.&lt;br /&gt;The arrival time was quick and it works okay</li>
    <li> Just a quick review about the excellent product. I just did a shave, and WOW, it does the job well. The shaver is fully washable so you don&#x27;t have to waste time with cleaning individual blades inside of the shaver; also the trimmer is useful for those finishing touches where you need them. Great product overall.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect fit for me. Price, performance, perfect. Can&#x27;t beat the combination of these two factors. Just another way to spell value.</li>
    <li> Very basic shaver, no fancy extras. Only thing I would prefer is the blades would come off for easy cleaning, instead they have a hinge. 3 weeks and liking the shave I get.</li>
    <li> Nice, just what i had been looking for.  Rotory heads (for me) always better than a Foil head electric razor.  nice, smooth.  I am a Happy customer.</li>
    <li> This really gives a great shave. I have a partial beard and I have no trouble shaving just the right parts. First shave, I pressed hard against face and lost a bit of hide.</li>
    <li> This thing, is amazing. I have had mine for years now and it still holds a long charge and shaves very well. I have pretty thick hair but this slices right through it. I would recommend it to anyone and will be buying another Philips Norelco when this finally does kick the bucket.</li>
    <li> This shaver has provided excellent service, good shaves and holds a charge for a surprisingly long time for a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I bought the same model about 15 years ago and the new one is just as good</li>
    <li> Takes much longer than previous Norelco shavers.</li>
    <li> I really love this shaver! This is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric shaver! It is as good as a traditional razor. It is super smooth, fast, and effective. It blows the $14 shaver that I just got rid of away. I really debated whether to give this 4 or 5 stars. The only reason(s) I give this 4 stars is because the construction is a little bit cheap (the body is thin plastic), and it was pretty dang expensive ($55 when I bought it). Otherwise, this is really top notch. There are no performance reasons to not buy this shaver. I would have to amend what I said earlier, in that it leaves a few tiny, tiny hairs on your face, but honestly, I think that might be inescapable with an electric razor. As far as I know, that is par for the course, and I really don&#x27;t want to switch back to a traditional razor, because it&#x27;s too slow. But yeah, this shaver is awesome, and I&#x27;d still very much say &amp;#34;buy it,&amp;#34; if you&#x27;re willing to spend this kind of money, but with a cheaper one, you&#x27;ll get cheaper results.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s an average razor</li>
    <li> Love this razor, nice close shave, easy to clean. Very happy, get it.</li>
    <li> I should have stayed with Panasonic ES-LT41-K Arc3. Probably it wasn&#x27;t a right time when I returned Panasonic one and bought this one. If you are a skinny guy, think twice before buying this one.</li>
    <li> Quite excellent product. I love it!</li>
    <li> Great product and great service!</li>
    <li> go it for my Dad in the nursing home..seems to hold a nice charge and shaves well</li>
    <li> Its convenient to use, but the razor is too weak and has a short span. I could invest in buying new ones, but too lazy to do that.</li>
    <li> This is a sparatic shave....not even..takes too long to go over and over</li>
    <li> Great product, high quality, fast delivery!! Highly Recommended!</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for 25 years and they are still great shavers at a decent price.</li>
    <li> excellent design  and function</li>
    <li> It works better than the cheaper ones its worth spending that exstra few dollars</li>
    <li> This is a rip-off! This will not even shave a hair from your face! And it hurts when try to make it do it! worst piece of junk ever!</li>
    <li> Very nice shaver. Good price and good features.</li>
    <li> Works great. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Norelco, +/- 30 yrs... They&#x27;re not like the were.  It&#x27;s not a good shaver, my opinion. Doesn&#x27;t shave close. I have to shave then repeat, repeat again. I wouldn&#x27;t buy another one.</li>
    <li> Still using it.  Good -</li>
    <li> Really disappointed with this. I dislike razor blades as my skin is sensitive, and shaving tends to be time consuming. Wanted something that could just give me a quick trim in the morning without having to go through the normal hassle of shaving with a razor. This product does not do that. Not sure if it&#x27;s just my facial hair, but this thing is horrible at giving me a clean, even shave. I pretty much have to use a razor after I use this to pick up all the stray hairs and patches this thing misses.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a longtime Norelco user so I was already used to the shave from this type razor, but this one really does a great job.  The floating heads are extremely comfortable.  This one is quieter than previous ones I&#x27;ve had, and it seems like the motor runs slower, but the shave is still very good--as good as all old ones.  Two Norelcos ago the razor came with a nice hard plastic case; one time ago the razor came with a cheap soft plastic case; this time the razor doesn&#x27;t have any case at all--I guess they are cutting costs and not sacrificing the important part--a quality shave.  I heartily recommend this razor</li>
    <li> Better than the PT730, but not nearly as good as some of the other, more expensive ones, on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somewhere in the manual it says that it will take almost 3 weeks for your hair to adjust to using this. I&#x27;ve had it for over a month now and my hair is still adjusting. I did a lot of research for an electric shaver and had I have taken the quality of an razor more seriously, I might have been more willing to spend more on a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is good if the price is the maximum you are willing to spend on a razor but I now know that I should have spent twice as much so that I can get a reliable razor.</li>
    <li> I got a good close shave the first time.  I have only had the shaver about a week.  I have been using Norelco shavers for over 30 years.  The batteries usually stay charged for up to 6 wk during the first year or two, then gradually I have to charge more often.  Hope this unit is as reliable as the others.</li>
    <li> This shaver was a gift for my Dad on fathers day. He loves it and says it works great. I was very pleased at how fast it came.</li>
    <li> does not provide a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;great disappointment-expected more a Norelco product.&lt;br /&gt;previous remington was a better shave - unfortunately I&lt;br /&gt;dropped it.</li>
    <li> After getting a cheap Remington via Groupon this was a big upgrade.  The shaver feels very smooth against the skin and doesn&#x27;t lose any power when you have it up against your face and whiskers.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The razor is good just like other reviewers have stated. However, the charger that came with it produces a high-pitched noise while charging. I find this noise quite noticeable and can be heard several feet away from it.</li>
    <li> My son with Down Syndrome .....using the Philips Norelco Razor can independently shave himself.  It allows him to attend to personal grooming without help....which is difficult with another shaving method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He loves it....and maintains it very well.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver 5 months ago. I shave about once a week, and haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet (after the initial charging)! Frankly, I&#x27;m surprised.</li>
    <li> 3 1/2 months and it no longer works. The charging system has malfunctioned. It will not charge. Stay away from this model.</li>
    <li> Not good for shaving when the whiskers get a little longer, takes a lot of extra time...</li>
    <li> Tough less hefty than the15-year old Norelco it replaces, ot works as it should. that the prior producr lasted 15years berfore being unable to hold a charge is quite good. Same feel, easy to clean, and easily replaced blades from time to time</li>
    <li> This is my third Norelco, the last one I used for about ten years before the pop up trimmer stopped working. How does the new one compare?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PT730/41 is lighter, quieter, smoother than the previous Norelco. The shave is much smoother. I find myself wanting to shave now, rather than dreading it (I was down to shaving once or twice a week). The new cutting head does not nick my mouth as the previous one did. Being able to rinse the cutters in the sink is a huge bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any new shaver, give it a few weeks for your beard to adjust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent value here. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It is convenient.&lt;br /&gt;This is the second Philips electric razor that we bought.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to wash, and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I received today, has been used. The effect is very good, looks pretty. I love thanksgiving, lol  I hope next is better</li>
    <li> I just got this Norelco PT730 shaver and used it a few days.  This is giving me an extremely close shave.  It is fast, quiet, and has plenty of power.  I used a Norelco wired many years ago but switched to the higher end Braun cordless screen type for about the last 10 years.  I&#x27;m now switching back to Norelco again.  The PT730 is just head and shoulders better for my face than the high end Braun and much lower cost.  It is also faster and quieter than the Braun.</li>
    <li> The product was sent to me very quickly. And I like it so much. I bought it as a gift for my father.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor.  Used it for a month and haven&#x27;t had to re-charge it yet.  Gives a nice shave.  Would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Have been using Norelco many years, this is the quietest by far. So far has been able to shave very close.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace another Norelco electric shaver which I used for over 10 years. After a month of use, this one gives a comfortable, close shave. I am still on my first charge. The feel is different since this shaver is much lighter than my old one. I did not need multiple shaves for my face to adjust to the new feel. The only disappointment is that it did not come with a case, as my previous one had.</li>
    <li> Best electric razor I ever owned.  It&#x27;s quiet, shaves close, keeps a charge a long time. And, it wasn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
    <li> Bought this one after many years of using my previous Norelco because it wasn&#x27;t worth ordering replacement heads as opposed to buying this one new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaves smooth and quiet. Has a charge and low charge warning light which is something my old model didn&#x27;t have. It did need the full 8 hours to charge to 100%. Pop-up trimmer works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have a heavy beard and want close comfort, get this shaver.</li>
    <li> great price&lt;br /&gt;works great for me&lt;br /&gt;can operate w or w/o cord&lt;br /&gt;charge life&lt;br /&gt;low battery indicator&lt;br /&gt;easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;multiple sources for replacement heads (once a year)</li>
    <li> The Norelco PT730 is a great shaver.  I owned a Norelco  for several years, but this new version is super and can be simply cleaned under a warm faucet.  The price is not much more than replacement heads for the older one,&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this item to anyone who would like a good shave and simple maintenance.</li>
    <li> Well manufactured unit and performs as well as expected.  It recharges quickly and turns off the charge cycle when done to prevent battery burnout. Runs somewhat slower than previous norelco shavers I have had, but still gets the job done very nicely.</li>
    <li> This razor works as advertised...what i like most about the item is that it holds its charge for a long time.  It also provides a very close and comfortable shave.  wish it was cheaper but overall very happy with product</li>
    <li> My husband received this for Christmas 2012, and he is well pleased.  He said he gets a very smooth shave, likes how easy it is to clean, and it makes little noise.  We got a good price on it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it when he is happy.</li>
    <li> It is working good to according to my expectations. I charge the razor weekly once. Not washed in water only cleaning by the brush</li>
    <li> I bought this one to replace a similar older one which had quit cuttting without going over my face over and over.  This one (new) did the same thing.</li>
    <li> I am super pleased with my Norelco Electric Razor. It performs very well and is really easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;the rotating heads. Ron Salley</li>
    <li> Not sure why anyone would need a more expensive shaver. Or why they&#x27;d mess with shaving cream and razors. This unit is quiet, light, goes forever on a charge, is easy to clean, looks nice, is reliable as the sunrise, and feels good in the hand. I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers all my life, and I think they&#x27;re pretty much perfected now. Everyone at the shaver R&amp;D lab can turn off the lights and go home.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace my piece of junk $20 remington shaver. You get what you pay for. The norelco works very good for me and tackles 3 or 4 day beards very well. But will leave a few stray hairs here and there but not a big deal. I need a quick fairly close shave to keep from irritating my skin and this does the job. I especially like the cord or corded part so I have a choice. Also a big plus is washable heads to keep it clean all the time. I let it dry overnight. All in all a very nice razor for $40 or less.</li>
    <li> It is a GREAT SHAVER for my husband for Christmas! He says that it is an easier shaver to shave with!&lt;br /&gt;Cuts great and leaves the face clean!</li>
    <li> The best thing about this razor is you can wash it out under water. It changes well, but it doesnt seem to run very fast. So it does tug at your face.</li>
    <li> Decent shaver for the money.  The shave is still not as close as a normal straight razor, but I&#x27;ve given up hope that an electric shaver will ever achieve.  Provides a reliable shave for the money you spend.</li>
    <li> close smooth razor&lt;br /&gt;worth the money&lt;br /&gt;great price&lt;br /&gt;happy customer&lt;br /&gt;i recommend this product for every one&lt;br /&gt;charge it up for a long lastiing battery</li>
    <li> I have been using electric screen shavers for the past 30 years. They were all Remingtons except for the one I had for the last 10 years which was a Braun Flex Integral. They all gave a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Braun Flex Integral got old and didn&#x27;t cut it anymore (pun intended). The motherboard had already been replaced once at a cost of $38. I decided to try a rotary electric razor because it can shave in all directions due to the way rotary&#x27;s are built.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received it, I immediate gave it a try using the battery power it had when it arrived. I was amazed at how close it got. My chin hairs were still showing stubble after used the old Braun, but the Norelco PT730 cut everything very close. No stubble anywhere on my face. As mentioned, my skin was already used to shaving with an electric shaver so my face had already adapted to using an electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this Norelco model because I wanted one that could shave with or without the power cord, in case the battery was dead. This removed any choice of the shavers that could be used in the shower (wet/dry types) because by definition a wet/dry electric shaver isn&#x27;t made that can be used with the powercord because you would be electrocuted in the shower. Additionally, if I am already in the shower I can use a regular blade to shave, although I&#x27;m not a big fan of blade shavers because of I sometimes get razor burn,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that this model can be cleaned under running water, unlike the Norelco PT720 which needs to be cleaned with a brush. Rinsing with water does a better job of cleaning it than a brush does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver also traps all the cut whiskers in the \\&quot;reservoir\\&quot; behind the cutters. Most of my foil shavers let many of the hairs fall onto my shirt, not the biggest problem in the world, but now my wife (who keeps her car interior super-clean) lets me use this shaver when I&#x27;m in her car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember that you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of pressure against your face. That will only bend the screens and the cutters. A light approach is all you need.</li>
    <li> I bought for my father&#x27;s friend. he don&#x27;t use yet. hope it will be good. I search the feedback in the internet,most people like this style.</li>
    <li> Not quite what I was hoping for. Even with a full charge (I have discharged and recharged twice now since purchase) the Phillips PT730 razor runs slow and does not do a decent job, at least not what I expected. I have used this razor daily now for several weeks. The razor really slows down when I start shaving as if it is starving for power. Maybe I just got a &amp;#34;lemon&amp;#34;, or maybe its because previously I had always used my electric Norelco that I have owned for many years, with lots of power!  Anyway, I am disappointed in this re-chargeable model.</li>
    <li> Good basic shaver with trimmer. It spins pretty quick for its price class. Holds a charge for days. Typical of shavers in this class it is a throw away when it dulls. This is a sad commentary on the industry that the price of the replacement blades is more than I paid for the shaver new. The shaver itself could last for years if the price of the blades made it worth keeping it around.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth Norelco shaver. The first two gave me satisfactory results. The third one, purchased two years ago was a disaster. It was the most expensive one yet, but performed poorly as a shaver. It needed to be charged frequently and in less than a year&#x27;s time the head assembly fell apart while I was cleaning it. Reassembling it did no good. As soon as I turned it on, it fell apart again repeatedly.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the PT 730 from Amazon after reading the reviews. It had the features I was looking for and it was very reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;The features I wanted and found on this shaver: it can be used with or without the cord, it can give you a&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;quick charge shave&#x27;, it has a sideburn trimmer (an essential feature that not all shavers have).&lt;br /&gt;And most importantly, it gives me a comfortable, non-irritating, close (for a machine) shave. And the relatively quiet motor is a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed some gripes about how shavers don&#x27;t compare to blades. This is astounding! Why  would anyone expect a machine to shave as closely as a blade? You&#x27;re using a machine for its CONVENIENCE. It&#x27;s quicker than shaving with a blade, there&#x27;s no messing with shaving cream and there&#x27;s no need for styptic pencils. The fact that they shave as closely as they do, is icing on the cake.</li>
    <li> Wow.  That&#x27;s the easiest way to describe my thoughts about the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best electric razor, bar none, I&#x27;ve ever owned. Great shave, no rash, no issues, nothing. Had I known this was THIS good, I would have ordered it a long time ago,,.super close shave, trimmer works fine, razor charges quickly and the charge lasts me about 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
    <li> The Norelco PT730 gives a close shave and is a terrific value.  It also is sleek looking and feels good in the hand.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was sad when my last Norelco shaver finally died. I think it was 12-15 years old. I was afraid that like so many things the new version wouldn&#x27;t be as good as the old. I am glad to report that this shaver works great and is easier to clean by rinsing with water. It is also lighter because of the lithium batteries. Maybe should have replaced sooner!</li>
    <li> This is the second Norelco I&#x27;ve owned.  First one lasted about 8 years.  Still works but the cutters needed replaced.  They cost just as much as a new razor.  I bought a new razor.  Like this one better.  Hope I get 8 years out of this one.</li>
    <li> This was a birthday gift for my hubby. It works well but doesn&#x27;t get to the roots of his mustache, so he purchased something else for himself. I read a lot of reviews and information about this product before I finally bought it. Not really happy about this product because I had great expectation from it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves being able to walk around while shaving.  Every one in a while when it really matters, he might trim up with a regular razor, but he&#x27;s really happy with it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for use in the field or downrange. battery holds for a little over a week. Highly reccomended for millitary</li>
    <li> It is very easy to use and has a good battery life when it is fully charged. It shaves well.</li>
    <li> Have owned Norelco shavers before. Lost charger for previous shaver during move. Less expensive to purchase new shaver rather than buy a charger. Plus this is a new version of the shaver and works very well.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this shaver to any guy that uses and electric shaver.  For the price it&#x27;s great. And very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> It was great until just stopped. once in a while it will start on its own in the drawer if you want to use it stops and will not work at all!!!</li>
    <li> Worked Great! And I would recommend this site to all I know. Same as before If I like something, than I should not have to write a letter about why. If I don&#x27;t like something or the site of purchase, I am more than glad to write a book.</li>
    <li> Got it around Black Friday. For $30, it&#x27;s great.  Holds charge for weeks and shaves like it should. Go Norelco.</li>
    <li> After charging initially, and shaving every day, it still is charged and cutting quite well. Wife is happy and that makes it great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always owned a Norelco.  First one I ever owned lasted more than 20 years.  The last two were fortunate if they lasted 2.  This one cuts nice and holds a charge pretty well.  Will have to wait and see how many years I get out of it.</li>
    <li> Light, quiet, holds charge well, portable, no razor rash, heads follow the contour of your face well.  Would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> For various reasons I&#x27;ve gone through a number of electric razors recently, and this is the best of the bunch (at least in my price range).  Very quiet and smooth cutting.</li>
    <li> I USE IT EVERY DAY. NOT AS CLOSE AS A STRAIGHT RAZOR BUT CLOSE ENOUGH FOR GOING OUT TO DINNER OR MEETINGS. I HAVE ONLY NEEDED TO RECHARGE IT ONCE IN FIVE WEEKS. LOVE THE FACT THAT I CAN USE IT &amp;#34;PLUGGED IN&amp;#34; IF NEED BE.</li>
    <li> Has difficulty shaving neck stubble.&lt;br /&gt;Quality of shave is satisfactory on smooth, side of face surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend something more powerful.</li>
    <li> This is for my 90 year old Dad who is in the habit of shaving daily and getting a little to shaky to shave with even a safety razor.  He loves the Philips Norelco (first electric razor he has had) as he can sit in his recliner watch westerns and get the best shave that he has ever had.  According to him at 90 life just doesn&#x27;t get any better.</li>
    <li> I have owned this shaver now a month, I had read the reviews about its&#x27; slow [razor] speed.  I thought this cannot be true. Well it is the slowest speed razor I have ever owned!!! BUT, it also gives the closest shave I have ever gotten from the three preceding Norelco&#x27;s I have owned. It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> Have used this shaver for about 6 months now.  Holds a charge much longer than my previous Norelco&#x27;s.  Can go for about two weeks of daily shaving before having to recharge.  Shaving performance is good but not great.  Have to cover the same territory several times to get a good close shave.  Good overall shaver.</li>
    <li> This is my third Norelco electric razor.  All have worked great.  Someone is still using the other ones.  I just wanted a new one after the many years I&#x27;ve enjoyed the last one.  This one works well, as expected, and the design is excellent.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor to shave my head and not my face.  The floating heads work well for that purpose. The razor is very quiet and seems to do the job effortlessly.  Godd purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 3 electic razors, this by far the best (granted most expensive at only $50- I&#x27;m frugal and read lots of reviews), but now know what reviews mean by &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; vs &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34;. Really just &amp;#34;glides&amp;#34; across skin, very quiet and quick. Hope this helps</li>
    <li> I found this version to be more powerful and effective than previous generations even though it uses the same head.  Comparing specifications I find that the motor is actually stronger and the battery is much better too.  This results in a higher value product and a more comfortable, faster shave.</li>
    <li> I was waffling between four and five stars, but settled on four.&lt;br /&gt;Nice, long charge.  Goes much longer between charges than my older model, even before it started not to hold as much charge.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s funny - every time I get a new Norelco, it sounds different than the previous models.&lt;br /&gt;Shaves nicely, trims nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Only caveat: Don&#x27;t judge it after the first charge.  The first charge didn&#x27;t last all that long and I thought I was going to be disappointed; however, the very next charge has lasted and lasted.&lt;br /&gt;Only negative: It didn&#x27;t come with any kind of stand, and the shape is slightly different from my last one, so the stand I&#x27;m keeping it in leaves me a bit unsure.  Will it tip over?  SO...I keep the travel cap on the blades in case it falls.  Almost every time I go to remove the cap, the blades spring open because the release is right at the front of the blade unit.  If it came with its own storage stand, it would be five-star rating.</li>
    <li> This replaced an old Norelco electric razor with a trimmer that died after ten plus years.  I was shocked at how light and cheap feeling this new razor was.  However, when I shaved my neck and face, I was impressed at how good a job it did.  Unfortunately, the trimming function was the main reason I purchased this razor and it is very poorly designed.  Compared to my previous razor, which had a solid metal slide to open and close the trimmer, this trimmer is as cheap as they come.  Further, the angle of the trimmer is almost 90 degrees to the razor vs 45 degrees from my older razor.  At 90 degrees, the razor gets in the way so you cannot see very well to trim your beard and moustache.  The off/on button is hard to find and push as is the trimmer button.  Also the button does not close the trimmer as before.  The trimmer function is hugely inferior and not recommended although the shave is good.  For my purposes, I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> This is my third Norelco electric razor, all of which have had long service lives. I like the PT730 the best so far because of the close shave it delivers at such a low cost. The dual precision cutting heads make this razor stand out in performance over previous Norelco razors. I held a star back because I have only had it for a few months.</li>
    <li> I purchased it at least a month or two ago. It works better if you shave without lotion on your body, when you legs are dry. However, it takes a few rounds to get almost all the hair off. However, for the price it&#x27;s ok for now.</li>
    <li> This Powertouch Electric Razor  is very cheap. And it use very easy. It can wash by water. But it can not clear by water only</li>
    <li> Razor performs as expected - close cut, smooth cut, trims easily, charges and indicates full charge visibly and cleans with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is the charging cord. The female plug doesn&#x27;t fit  tightly and pulls out frequently which is annoying! Other than that it would have received a five star rating.</li>
