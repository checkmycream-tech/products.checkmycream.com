<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The design is good.  It just takes a few passes before you get all the hair cut to length you set.</li>
    <li> It cuts hair pretty good. It doesn&#x27;t mow through your hair like the one at the barber shop, but it does the job. However don&#x27;t use this thing unless you are experienced at cutting your own hair, or unless you want to want to cut it all down to the nub like a military boot camp look. It is pretty good for trimming sideburns, around the ears, etc. I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times for a total of maybe 30 to 45 minutes on the original charge and the battery is still holding up fine.</li>
    <li> Have only used the trimmer to keep my 14 year olds neck and sideburns trimmed up but seems to do the job well and have had no problems after about two months of use.</li>
    <li> Very light, nice adjustable cutter even if it&#x27;s on. Not noisy, but Panasonics are quieter. The only complaint is that the min length with a comb 1 and without comb, 0, there&#x27;s too much of a difference, so you can&#x27;t blend it in on to transition from a 0 on the side to longer hair on the top. So I use another cutter I have where you adjust the cutter length (without comb). And let&#x27;s face it, this is a problem because most people buying self cutters will do short hair style.</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with these clippers. They are lite, easy to use, never need sharpening and very affordable. If you are a do it yourself barber, you won&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for several years, the last few by using the Remington Shortcut. I&#x27;ve been very pleased with it, but it took an unfortunate drop to a tile floor which caused the cutter head to crack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was tempted to replace it with another Shortcut, but I came across this at a great sale price at a local store, and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that I&#x27;m testing this only on my own hair which is sort of, kind of missing on the top, and worn very short (about 1/4 to ½ inch long). Can&#x27;t vouch for how these will perform on longer or thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Then again, if you do have a full, thick head of hair, be thankful that you have reason to pay someone to do a good job with it, and don&#x27;t even bother with cutting your own!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build quality - the Norelco feels more substantial than the Remington. If their shaver lines are a reference point, the Norelco should easily outlast the Remington. The Remington shavers I&#x27;ve owned have never lasted very long (with the battery a specific trouble spot). On the plus side, Remington has excellent customer service and will quickly replace a broken product (unfortunately, I know that from several rounds of shaver exchanges).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cutting ability - both cut cleanly and easily. No snags or pulls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noise - again, about the same. Not what you&#x27;d call quiet, but you won&#x27;t need ear plugs either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Settings - both have a wide range of settings from bald to reasonably long. I keep it at the 1/4 to ½ inch settings. Both have positive click-stops for the settings so it stays set where you want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maneuverability - this is where the Norelco really shines. The blade is narrower and the comb guide articulates making it easier to deal with the small bumps and crevices in your skull. The Remington, being longer, does not deal with uneven spots as well. The Remington is also harder to use around the ears. The Norelco can be adjusted so that you can pivot the head 180 degrees, making it easy to get behind your ear using either hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ease of use - the Remington is more intuitive. If you know how to brush your hair, you know how to use it. The Norelco takes a bit of practice to get everything to come out even. Not hard to do, but there is definitely a learning curve. In other words, don&#x27;t use it for the first time right before you need to look your best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning ease - the Norelco is slightly easier to clean since the blade is smaller. Neither pose much of a problem, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mess - both can be messy. I usually stand in the shower when I cut my hair (with the water off, of course) and then just wash the trimmings down the drain after I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neck and sideburn trimming - both can do it, but both are far less effective than a dedicated trimmer, such as the Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery - I didn&#x27;t test the actual run time, but the Norelco allows you to plug into the wall and use the cutter if you run out of battery juice midway through a haircut. The Remington can&#x27;t be used plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the winner? For me it&#x27;s almost a dead heat, but if I had to pick one, I&#x27;d go with the Norelco by a nose. I like the enhanced manoeuverability of it and I feel more confident that it will last longer than the Remington. It did take some time to learn how to use, however, so if you are not confident in your eye-hand coordination, the Remington is the better option. Both will get the job done, and will pay for themselves very quickly.ing either hand.    Ease of use - the Remington is more intuitive. If you know how to brush your hair, you know how to use it.

    <li> I just bought the QC5170 180-Degree Hair Clipper and performed by first self haircut. Having never performed the operation before it did take some getting used to. I ignored the instructions and went to work with the short comb and a 2 setting. I will admit it ended up a little shorter then I may have preferred, but overall I am pleased.     As long as the trimmer is held firmly to the head the device seems to cut rather effectively. Then again I have nothing to compare it to, other then what I have experienced in the barber shop for the past 20 some odd years. Good product for a low price.    A container would have been nice, but there are not all that many pieces to store. I had an old shower caddy hanging around from college days, and the 4 pockets did the job well.</li>
    <li> Just got the clipper yesterday.  Charged overnight and gave a whirl this morning.  Great ergonomics with the swivel head.  Gives a clean cut.  Well made product, feels solid in my hand.  Just realize that these clippers, even at the longest hair setting, still gives somewhat of a buzz cut.  If you like your hair a little longer to style, these clippers are not for you.  When you clip your hair with these, there is no need to style, and that&#x27;s just how I like it.</li>
    <li> FIrst things first: These DO WORK! I cut my own hair with them, and it works great, and fast. I don&#x27;t know if others who have tried using these just were cutting in the wrong direction or what, but it&#x27;s either they did not know how to cut their own hair, or they had magical anti-Philips hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It works! MOST importantly (to me), was that it works even when it&#x27;s not charged up! You can run it off of the wall cord, so if you are forgetful (like myself), and forget to let it charge for 8 hours, no worries! Just make sure you have a plug close enough. I really only need to charge it every three hair-cuts or so, as it also keeps it&#x27;s battery&#x27;s charge for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro Tip: Cut against the natural \\&quot;grain\\&quot; of your hair, for maximum effectiveness. Otherwise, you&#x27;re just pushing your hair down, and no cutter in the world will trim it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: ... Well, I honestly love this product, but if I must point out a fault, I guess it would be that to get the many levels of hair trimming, you must use two different heads. It can be a little annoying to switch in the middle of a cut, but I guess I can forgo those five seconds of my life every few weeks to switch out the two heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: If you like to cut your own hair, or the hair of someone else (and you want it to be a \\&quot;buzz\\&quot;ish cut), then may I suggest this product. It works, it keeps working (Owned for 9 months now), and it really does cut your hair.</li>
    <li> Originally I was tempted by the reviews of the Oster clippers, ranging from $70 to $100.  Then I did some more digging and I found this pair.  Glad I did the extra research.  The Oster&#x27;s don&#x27;t have pivoting heads.  They may be more powerful, but you don&#x27;t need that much power unless you&#x27;re running a salon/barber shop and giving multiple haircuts a day.  For the average person cutting hair every once in a while this is your set (especially if you&#x27;re doing your own hair).  This product is excellent.  I got it in the mail two days ago and put it straight to work.  I t comes with everything you need without the unnecessary fluff of the 27 piece kits.  Two things make this trimmer for me:  1)  The rotating head feature.  I want to be able to easily cut my own hair, and this allows me to do it.  I don&#x27;t have to hold the trimmer at awkward angles to cut the back or sides of my head.  Awesome.  2)  The adjustable height setting.  This is my first se of clippers, but as far as I know, most other clippers require you to buy different heads for each length setting.  This pair of clippers has a built-in height adjustment feature with five height settings.  It comes with two heads, each of which can be adjusted from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest), giving you 10 total height settings with just two heads.  Plus, it comes with a precision trimmer attachment which is awesome for cleaning up around the ears and neck.  The one thing you WILL need if cutting your own hair is another hand-held mirror so you can see the back of your neck and behind your ears when you&#x27;re trimming.  other than that, you&#x27;re set to go!  Highly recommended.    The one ting I cannot comment on is the longevity.  I&#x27;ve only used the product once, but nothing leads me to believe it will not last for quite a while.  If it does break prematurely, I&#x27;ll adjust this review.</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper about 1.5 years ago. I used it every month for one year and I&#x27;m now using it every two weeks, keeping my hair quite short (blade spacer at click #2).  I clean it thoroughly each time I use it. After about 20 cuts the blade started to get dull: it still cuts, but obviously not as new. That&#x27;s still a good deal, and spare blades are available on-line for about $15-20.  Tip #1: if your hair doesn&#x27;t grow perpendicular to your head, you&#x27;ll have a hard time reaching a short cut, no matter how hard you try. The trick is to use the same approach used by shaving razors: one hand raises the hair, followed by the other hand holding the clipper. Done  Tip#2: the blade is straight, your head is round: don&#x27;t expect to achieve an even trim all around with just a few passages. Work front to back and side to side, overlapping every passage by at least half the width of the blade. Voilat   NOTE- no clipper would do a complete hair cut: the fuzz on the back of the head will need to be trimmed first without any blade spacer and then with a razor, by somebody else than you (unless you&#x27;re that good to look in the mirror the reverse image of what you&#x27;re doing holding a razor ...).</li>
    <li> I been using a Remington for years and I thought I would try the Norelco.  I was excited to get this product until I started to use it.  I doesn&#x27;t cut as well as my Remington you have to go over several times to cut. I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get a preview copy of the new Norelco 180 degree hair clipper to try out.  When I first took it out of the box, I was amazed at how light it was and best of all CORDLESS!    I&#x27;m a simple hair-cut guy and do #2 all the way around and a #1 on the goatee.      I gave the 180 degree clipper a whirl and it performed flawlessly right out of the box (it comes charged).  I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair myself for the past 8 years and this is the first cordless clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.  It was so much easier having the freedom to angle the clippers as you see fit.    I didn&#x27;t utilize the 180 degree adjustment feature that much, but did find it helpful when having to do the left side of my head as I&#x27;m not that great with my left hand.  Being able to adjust the clippers made it feel more natural in my left hand when doing the back of my scalp and on the sides.    The clipper also performed flawlessly on my full goatee as I simply dialed down the clipper from a #2 to a #1 with the push of a button.  That&#x27;s right...all the numbered guards (up to 5) are built-into the clipper.  You simply adjust the dial to the number you want and you&#x27;re off.  No more changing guards!    Only thing was that the built-in guard guides are a little too long and it prevented me from getting up under my nose on my mustache, but other than that this product is a winner and is certainly replacing my corded clippers!    ****UPDATE****  Six months later this thing is still my go to clipper for haircuts.  I&#x27;m still hitting the #2 all over on a regular basis and the cordless clipper performs without a hitch.  Battery life is still nice after multiple charges.  This thing is a winner!</li>
    <li> These are very nice hair clippers. Lightweight, cordless and simple to use. They work best if you keep your hair buzzed pretty short. Make sure your hair is clean and dry. Set it at the length you want and take your time. The 180 degree adjustment was not used but I suppose it could come in handy. It also works good for beards. I charged the battery for 8 hours and it still has juice after a 15 minute cut. May seem a bit flimsy but works great.</li>
    <li> This clipper is fantastic if cutting your own hair. Which is what it was really designed to do .... the 180 pivot rocks in this regard. The clipper also has some pretty neat hair length adjustments. The pivot does become a bit of a pain when compared to other clippers when cutting other people&#x27;s hair. Big bonus - is that it is cordless.    So basically - if you cut your own hair with clippers - then get this. If you cut other people&#x27;s hair more often - then get a standard clipper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using an old Wahl trimmer for about 15 years and although it&#x27;s reliable it&#x27;s heavy and the cord gets in the way. The blade is also dull making for a sometimes painful  haircut. For those reasons I was really impressed with the Philips Norelco QC5170 180-Degree Hair Clipper. I&#x27;ve used this product twice to cut my hair and so far it has performed great. The blade is sharp and the trimmer is lightweight, fast, and powerful.  The swivel function makes trimming the back of my head much easier and I love that it&#x27;s cordless. Adjusting the trimming height and swapping out the combs is easy and there are lots of length options although I always cut my hair without a guard for the closest cut possible. The only thing I&#x27;m not sure about is the durability of this product. Being plastic and so light I&#x27;m afraid it won&#x27;t last as long as my old Wahl has but for that I&#x27;ll just have to wait in see. The low price makes that not a big concern anyways.</li>
    <li> When I first unpacked the Norelco QC5170 hair clipper, I was a bit skeptical because it was lighter than what I had expected. But after using the clipper for the first time, the light weight was more of an advantage than a detriment because it seemed to give me better control of its functions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper&#x27;s motor is strong and easily cut through my hair, which is fairly thick. The self-cleaning blades are also great; no more oiling! I also found the design of the clipper to be well thought out. Aside from being comfortable in my hands, the fact that it&#x27;s cordless and with a pivoting head makes the clipper easy to use. In addition, the trim length is not adjusted by changing guides, but by adjusting the blade height. There is a red button that, when depressed, lets you dial the height of the blade in relation to the built-in guide, thus adjusting the length of the cut.  The button also protects you from accidentally changing the blade position while you&#x27;re cutting your hair.  If you&#x27;re used to the numbered guides that the barber shop uses to determine hair length, you will need to be aware that the clipper&#x27;s numbering system is different. The number 5 setting with the shorter, built-in guide on the Norelco clipper is more like a number 2 or 3 setting on a standard barber shop cutting guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper came pre-charged so I could use it right out of the box. And the clipper was conveniently packaged. One thing I hate are products that seem to require explosives to unpack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like to trim your own hair, then I would recommend this product. This is truly a clipper designed with the DIY&#x27;er in mind.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for around 10 years now. I&#x27;m not a stylist -- I just wait until the hair and my beard get unruly and then clip everything back to almost nothing. The Philips Norelco QC5170 clipper is great for this.    The clipper I&#x27;ve been using is one I bought 10 years ago in a drugstore for around $20. It worked OK but it took seemingly forever to cut my hair, at least 45 minutes. This was mainly because 1) the clipper had to constantly be cleared during the cut and 2) I had to constantly go over the same hair patches to ensure everything was even. I settled for this because I figured that this was the default experience when cutting your own hair (I had no experience with other clippers to make a real comparison).    With this Philips Norelco clipper, I was done in about 15 minutes, which includes a complete dome shaving and a beard trimming. One of the best things is that I didn&#x27;t end up with red, irritated skin on the back of my neck and around my throat like I used to; since you don&#x27;t have to keep going over the same areas with this more powerful clipper, you don&#x27;t end up with sore skin. And you don&#x27;t have to deal with a cord constantly winding around your wrist, which is very convenient.    The pivoting head, which locks in at three different angles, provides the same service as the two or three angled cutting heads that came with my old clipper. I never used those much, but I do use the pivot now. This takes some getting used to, especially for someone like me who has learned self-clipping using only one angle. But use the different angles a couple of times and they&#x27;ll make sense to you as they did for me.    I like how many fewer parts there are to this clipper. The two adjustable heads and the trimmer head are designed to take the place of multiple clip-on heads found with old clippers. And the clipper needs no oil, so you don&#x27;t need a little tube of said stuff hanging around. As someone mentioned here, though, it would be nice to have a bagincluded to throw all the parts into, one relatively small that can be tossed into a bathroom drawer. Instead, all you have is the original box, which is too cumbersome to open and to store in a bathroom; I&#x27;m using a kitchen storage bag for storage to hold everything, one with a ziplock. It works out OK.    When I think about how much I save each year cutting my own hair, the cost of this clipper becomes very reasonable. Mind, I don&#x27;t get fancy cutting my hair, so if you do -- if you like a layered look, for instance -- your experience might be different from mine. But in general, I was surprised and pleased at how quickly this strong little clipper went through my messy hair.</li>
    <li> I have been trimming my own hair for 10 years now. I find this clipper very comfortable. The 180-degree turning feature is useful, but what I like best is the angle of the blades to the clipper body: makes a comfortable position for cutting one&#x27;s own hair.</li>
    <li> I found that it made the work much easier and the cuts more consistent by being able to change the direction of the cutting head to maintain a comfortable grip on the clippers.  I have done this with normal hair clippers successfully but it was more tedious and time consuming than with the new Norelco Hair Clippers.</li>
    <li> Got this cause my husband is left handed and thought the rotating head would be easier. But he is use to holding it the other way so doesnt really use it. BUT He says its so much lighter then typical clippers its better to use. Arms dont get tired and can get his fade for military cut in much better. Also a time saving and space saving with out all the clips. This simply has two clips that just pop on and off and adjusts to different lenghts so u can get many sizes. Would diffenetly reccomand to other service members who want to fade and want to do it easily at home.</li>
    <li> easy to use, light weight, only have to go over your hair once and it cuts everything without having to do multiple passes</li>
    <li> I had to admit when I first held this little cordless Norelco in my hand I had to laugh a little bit.  Surely there&#x27;s no way it could smoothly plow through my thick hair!  To my surprise, however, it ripped right through without a single cough or fit.  I was also surprised to discover I could cut my own hair pretty well with it!  I&#x27;ve been paying Pro Cuts $15 a month for years just for them to give my hair a buzz, and now I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need them ever again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 180-degree turning feature is a nice addition to the product, though I found I did most of my clipping at the standard upright position, there were a few times where I needed to go in from the side.  The attachments work well, except for the Precision Trimmer which I found wasn&#x27;t able to trim away the annoying hairs that grow down my neck at all.  I had to use my other shaver for that.  It did work nicely for that delicate hair line above the ears, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do admit, that as a first time self hair cutter I had my friend look at it too to make sure I didn&#x27;t miss a few spots - which, of course, I did - but again surprisingly few.  With a couple more trims I&#x27;ll no doubt become a pro with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So.. let&#x27;s do the math.  $15 hair cuts once a month (sometimes more) and this costs $40... hmm, sounds like it&#x27;ll pay for itself in no time!  Now I admit I&#x27;ve just started using it so I can&#x27;t comment on the life span, but with the self-sharpening blades it seems like it should last a long time and provide many great cuts before pooping out.  Definitely worth trying!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair off and on for years now, so when I saw these new clippers from Philips Norelco I figured I had to give it a shot. Unfortunately, although it looks like a great idea, it just doesn&#x27;t perform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head swivels in 90 degrees in either direction (for a full 180 degree turning base) which makes it much easier to hold and guide, especially if you&#x27;re trimming your own hair. It&#x27;s lightweight so fatigue from holding heavy clippers in weird positions isn&#x27;t an issue. It comes with two guards, the one shown and one designed for longer cuts. It also comes with a second blade that&#x27;s thinner for more precise trims. The guards are literally a snap to change and the red dot shown on the handle is used to slide it up and down for longer and shorter trims. This can be easily done while holding it with a simple slide of the thumb. It&#x27;s cordless so no worries about getting all tangled while attempting to cut your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after all that, why did I give it only 2 stars?? Simple, it doesn&#x27;t really cut. I would go over the same spot and all it seemed to do was comb the hair. I had to hold the hair taught to get it to cut. I tried both wet and dry, and several times it just pulled my hair. I even plugged it in hoping that direct juice would help, but to no avail. Unfortunately, I had to resort to my old Remington clippers I got at Target for twenty bucks a few years ago to finish the job. The difference was night and day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as Philips Norelco did right for these clippers, they neglected the most important thing. To be effective, they must actually cut hair.</li>
    <li> For more than one reason, I haven&#x27;t seen the insides of a hair-cuttery in more than a decade. Flowbee was my trusted hair-management solution for all these years until I had the opportunity to try out Norelco&#x27;s &#x27;Philips Norelco QC5170 180-Degree Hair Clipper&#x27; and [[ASIN:B002C741NG Philips Norelco QC5055 Power Hair Clipper]]. Now, I&#x27;m sold on these two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Focusing on the QC5170, it lets quickly and efficiently do the back of my head and the sides and, thanks to the pivoting head feature, I can do it all by myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Operation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once charged, all you need to do is attach the proper comb (see below), select the desired hair length and proceed with cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair-cutting tends to be a borderline traumatic experience for me - I&#x27;m a long hair type person - but this was a near-painless experience. I am looking forward to more future haircuts. It goes fast, smooth and easy and, in my case - I was only doing some advanced styling on the back and the sides following an initial cut - I didn&#x27;t even need to clean the comb when I was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may not apply to everyone but, speaking for myself, I can use either hands to hold the clipper. Even with both hands available, self-cutting would have been an awkward and difficult operation with a traditional tool but, on the QC5170 all I need to do is pivot the comb 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise and I could reach any spot on my head easily and comfortably. As for technique, I go against the direction of hair growth first then, for a nice finish, I go in the opposite direction to even things out. In the end, I&#x27;m pretty close to what most would get from a professional hair stylist in exchange for maybe $20 or maybe more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you get:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The hair clipper body hosting the rechargeable batteries.&lt;br /&gt;- The clipping attachment&lt;br /&gt;- Stainless steel, self-sharpening cutting blades&lt;br /&gt;- Precision cutter for contouring&lt;br /&gt;- Large comb - .51-.83in. (13-21mm)&lt;br /&gt;- Small comb - .12-.43in. (3-11mm)&lt;br /&gt;- Charger&lt;br /&gt;- Cleaning brush&lt;br /&gt;- English/Spanish instructions&lt;br /&gt;- Registration card with $20 coupon offer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some specs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Battery life is rated at up to 60 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;- Charge time is 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;- Cuts hair from .12 in./3 mm to 1.61 in./41 mm.&lt;br /&gt;- 10 length settings between the 2 combs (5 on each of the large and small combs)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returns and warranties:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a 45-day money back guarantee promise if the customer can provide proof of purchase and ships the item, insured, to Norelco at own expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2-year warranty promises to replace defective products for as long as the customer didn&#x27;t do anything &#x27;unreasonable&#x27; and he/she paid for shipping the item to Norelco, preferably insured. Proof of purchase of course, is a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the surprising ease of use and operation and the quality of the haircut, I liked the easy cleaning and maintenance and the fact that, if needed, it can operate in a &#x27;corded&#x27; mode. The easy grip makes self-cutting easy, efficient and confident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brief manual is written in good English and is very good at illustrating cleaning and assembly and has very good advice on maintenance, preserving battery life and even some haircutting tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Issues:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My big problem and the only one so far is the lack of some case or storage box. With so many parts of which some are small and/or fragile, not providing some way to store them, protect them and keeping them organized is inexcusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also having an issue with the maximum length. .83in. is too short for me. I can use this at the longest length setting for my back and sides but, for the rest, I will be using the QC5055. I understand that most men will be happy with the maximum length on this clipper so, for most, the QC5170 is all that may be needed to achieve hair-clipping peace of mind or even happiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would have been an easy 5-star if it came with a case. Since it doesn&#x27;t, it gets 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still recommend the QC5170 most highly but be prepared to supply your own box or pouch - I did - or risk losing combs or the cleaning tool or maybe misplace the all essential charger.r own box or pouch - I did - or risk losing combs or the cleaning tool or maybe misplace the all essential charger.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve cut my own hair for the last 13 years, so every hair cut is a little different and some better than others. This hair cutter is easy to use, with just two attatchments and each with 5 different length settings. It is easy to pick the setting you want, and the guard stays locked in place so you won&#x27;t have any accidents. Fully charged, the motor is powerful enough to cut the thickest hair. The cutter rotates, and I haven&#x27;t figured out the exact usefulness for that feature yet. This hair clipper is compact, powerful and easy to use. It&#x27;ll definitely make your task easier if you are cutting your own hair, or your kids hair and trying to save money. One problem, I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to attach the beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> I was a little reluctant to try this one instead of a heavier, traditional clipper, but I&#x27;m very glad I did.  It is much, much better for trimming your own hair than a normal clipper.  The rotating head is actually really useful and makes it easier to do a good job on the back and sides.  Plus it&#x27;s light so it&#x27;s easy to maneuver with one hand.  One thing I was skeptical about was the adjustable combs, but that turned out to be one of the best features.  It lets you change lengths for fades on the fly--you can do it with your thumb without changing your grip so you can fade the same area at one time without switching combs and starting over. It also means I don&#x27;t have to keep a full set of combs around or need a case to keep the clipper in--the two comb attachments are tidy enough I can leave them out between trims.  The clipper blade itself works much better than my old Andis clipper, so I don&#x27;t have to go over the same area so many times to get all the hair the same length.  The comb itself is also more comfortable and doesn&#x27;t leave your scalp sore when you&#x27;re done.  This is partly because the plastic is softer and a little flexible, which is my biggest concern because I worry it might break more easily than normal combs and would be harder to replace, but it&#x27;s worth it for the comfort and convenience.  All in all a great product that I would recommend if you are on the fence about the gimmicky-looking design.  In this case, the gimmick really works!</li>
    <li> The guy in the imagery on the packaging and coupons I&#x27;ve seen has very short hair like mine. Yet, he is using one of the combs. There is no way you can get your hair that short with one of the combs/guards attached. I&#x27;ve tried it. If you don&#x27;t use the guard, you are cutting down to the scalp. Too short for me. I&#x27;m taking it back to Target. Nice idea. Really wanted it to work, but it doesn&#x27;t. I have a problem with the visuals Norelco is using, too. A bit misleading, unless I&#x27;m not seeing something.</li>
    <li> This is the deal if you have thinning hair and like to keep it close. I&#x27;m still in shock how well this thing worked. This is the first time I have ventured into buzzing my own hair so I can&#x27;t speak for other products. I gave myself a better cut than the one I paid for two weeks ago. I use it with no guard so I can&#x27;t say how well it works with a guard. In 15 min I had a good hair trim. In 30-40 min it looked like I had been to a good barber. the more you go over it, the better it looks as it&#x27;s always the case whenever I had to go to a barber. Now to figure out what I&#x27;m going to do with my extra $42 bucks a month.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for awhile using an Oster. That thing was pretty good, but a bunch of the guides seemed to just start losing their little plastic-y pieces on the sides that held them in place on the cutter. Didn&#x27;t really handle them roughly or anything - just noticed that there were more and more that were unusable over time. So I saw this item at Target and considered buying it. Then I got a gift certificate for Amazon and purchased it. I&#x27;ve used it once but I can tell I&#x27;m gonna be using it quite a bit. This thing is way easier to use and I really like that it has only 2 guides with 5 settings on the unit to adjust. Made for self-cutting so you can adjust the angle that your hand holds to your head. The guides feel sturdy. Occasionally I&#x27;d go to Sports Clips or wherever for a more \\&quot;professional\\&quot; finish but that&#x27;s gonna happen much less often I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update March 2013: Have used this many times and it works great. Saves lots of money.</li>
    <li> The rotating top definitely comes in handy, it&#x27;s nice to not have to uncomfortably contort yourself just to clip your hair. I with it came with more trimming options, but for a straight up clipper I&#x27;ve been highly satisfied. It&#x27;s also proved to work out great for clipping out hairballs for long-hair cats ;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shelling out $20 a month for many years to get my hair cut at the barber shop. I decided to try this item on a whim, and reasoned that it cost less than two haircuts, so even if it didn&#x27;t do a great job, it wouldn&#x27;t be much of a loss. I am happy to report that this item is perfect for doing what it was designed to do - giving yourself a buzz cut. The way the head rotates makes it easy to hold with either hand, regardless of what part of the head you are trimming. This is really as good an ergonomic design as is possible. It never feels awkward. You DO need to press it firmly against your head, and go over the same area more than once from different directions, but the finished haircut is more neat and even than the barber has ever given me (probably because he usually has a line of people waiting and isn&#x27;t super-picky about the quality of the haircut.)     The guides are easy to snap on and take off, and adjusting the length of the cut is a breeze, but you can&#x27;t accidentally change it while cutting. I purchased a small leather case to store this in, since it does not come with one and has a few loose pieces that you won&#x27;t want cluttering up your bathroom counter. Both the quality/sturdiness of this item and the power of its motor feel good. As long as this product stands the test of time, it&#x27;s very deserving of 5 stars. Now I will have an extra $20 a month in my pocket, and don&#x27;t have to worry about when I can get to the barber schedule-wise.</li>
    <li> I have been buzzing my head for years as I like my hair practically bald but with some stubble.  This unit replaced a Panasonic trimmer with a flimsy plastic guard.  I was going to buy this or the Remington Shortcut but I read some bad reviews on the battery for that one and you also can&#x27;t use it plugged in which you can with this Norelco.  While that doesn&#x27;t seem like a big deal, it will if the battery ever dies and you are only half done.    When I took this unit out of the box I put on the shorter plastic guard and tried it out and it did not cut one hair on my head.  Apparently even the #1 setting on the plastic guard was longer than my hair was after a week&#x27;s growth.  Initially I thought well this sucks, I can&#x27;t use this at all.  I then took off the plastic guard and tried it with no guard.  With most clippers you really can&#x27;t do this because the blade sticks out from the unit and digs into your head.  But this unit has a flat piece before the blade which guides it as it moves on your head so it doesn&#x27;t dig and just moves around smoothly.  With the great ergonomics of this unit and the pivoting head it buzzed up my head very quickly, much faster than my old Panasonic and it didn&#x27;t dig into my head.    So if you are a stubble buzzer like me, take off the plastic guard and go to town, because this will work perfectly for you without scratching the hell outta your noggin.</li>
    <li> After several failed attempts trying to buy a Remington Shortcut that would hold a charge, I stumbled onto the Philips Norelco QC5170. It is by far the best hair clipper I have ever owned.   First things first...this baby holds a charge! It has over an hour of run time on a full charge. And if the charge does run out, it works with its AC charger plugged in. So you&#x27;re never stuck with half a haircut and a dead set of clippers.   The cutter is powerful. The blades move fast so they don&#x27;t pull your hair, they cut it.  Its adjustable cut settings and its pivoting spacer comb combine to produce a great, easy haircut. I also use it to trim my beard. The primary spacer comb easily pops off for easy cleaning, or to attach one of the specialty combs and cutters that also come with it.  I enthusiastically recommend this product.</li>
    <li> my first hair clipper and I was able to cut my hair on my own. very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my own hair for over 10 years now. And I like to cut my hair very short. Just short enough where you can still see that there is hair. Normally to get it that short, the razors I have used in the past have caused a lot of redness and irritation on my skin. Well not with the new Philips Norelco 190 Degree Hair Clipper. This has to be the closest shave I have ever had without any signs of skin irritation. These clippers do come with 2 attachments in case you prefer not to be bald like me. Also you get a brush to clean your clippers. One thing absent from the box is the little container of oil to oil the blades. The reason for that is that you don&#x27;t need to use oil on the blades. and even better the blades are self sharpening. Another plus is that these clippers are cordless which makes it so much easier to use them all over your head without having to adjust for a cord. I do suggest when you first get it, to charge the clippers for at least 8 hours. I am glad to ahve received this product and plan on using it for many years to come.</li>
    <li> Look, when you go to one of those discount hair cutting chains they basically treat your head like a big ball, now you can do it yourself.  The cordless feature is great.  Great way to save money if you like to wear your hair short.</li>
    <li> I am retired and my wife cuts my hair since I do not need to be as picky as in my prior executive position.  But, she does a good job.  Accordingly, comments on the Phillips Norelco Hair Clipper are those of my wife combined with mine.  First, the clippers cut well and a charge is more than enough to provide several full haircuts.  Second, the clippers are light and easy to handle partially because of the comfortable design and the absence of a power cord that can constrain movement.  Third, the adjustable rotation of the cutting head was judged to be of minor benefit and we believe the clippers could be easily used without the rotating head because they are shaped comfortably.  Fourth, the motor is not as strong as the plug-in model we have been using because the motor will slow down slightly in the event of a small hair clog.  Once the clog is brushed away, the motor returns to its previous speed.  We do not think this is a major issue because the motor maintains enough power to cut properly.  Fifth, when held at the wrong angle during close clipping around the neck area, the clippers will scratch mildly but not visibly.  This is overcome by reducing the angle of cut slightly.  On the whole, we liked the clippers and are happy with their performance.  Any imperfections are easily overcome with a little practice.  If Phillips Norelco could make these clippers at a lower cost by eliminating the rotating cutting head, we believe it would be a greater value than it already is.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve absolutely loved this hair clipper ever since I started using it. It makes cutting my own much easier than the previous clipper I was using. The rotating head is extremely useful for getting the back of my neck and sides of my head. I tend to use the clippers without the guard on for very close cut weekly and have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Bought it years ago. Still working just like brand new. Best clipper ever. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a great step up from the standard conventional clippers.  I was wrong.  The biggest drawback I have with this is that on conventional clippers, on the setting with no attachments, just the blade, the blade actually has two settings. You can increase it if you like. Maybe I&#x27;m the only one out there that uses that second increase on the blade setting itself.  This, does not have that.  If you take the clip attachment off, it&#x27;s just a straight blade, no way to increase that.  Other than that, I like it, I like that it can rotate, I like the ease of switching amongst the setting increments.  it&#x27;s light.  I wish it came with a case though, because it doesn&#x27;t.  I travel a lot so it would be great to put it in something, without fear of breaking off a tip of the attachments or something.  Not ever oiling it again is great too.  if that&#x27;s true.</li>
    <li> This do-it-yourself hair-cut clipper is great. It is extremely easy and fast to cut your own hair, all the way around. No problems whatsoever. This product works as advertised. Thank you Philips Norelco for doing such a fine job in designing this unit.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair clipper. I found that i didnt use the swivel action for the clipper but it kept cutting even when it filled with hair.    I&#x27;m only giving this 4 stars because it would fill with hair, although it kept cutting even when it was full of hair.</li>
    <li> Well, they worked alright as long as you make sure not to loose the included comb. The blades dont cut through hair that great and the comb constantly gets clogged. Also, the product information is misleading, the blades definately need oiling once every couple uses (oil is even included).    Now, I will never buy another product from philips again, after loosing the smaller comb, my clippers were almost useless to me. So I called up customer support, to find out they wanted 16USD ! for the replacement comb. Thats about half the cost of the whole item. REDICULOUS.</li>
    <li> This stuff is one of the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever ordered. You know ,you go into a barber&#x27;s, paying 10 dollars for your haircut,plus 20% tip and 10% tax, and you just get a barber cut your hair with a clipper, is that even worth doing? So I just decided to buy this item and it came with great multiple functions. You can even shave your beard with it. The seller was good, although it wasn&#x27;t shipped very soon at first, but as I wrote a complain, they really did helped me with it, so I&#x27;m totally pleased with it!</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that I could use for a \\&quot;buzz cut\\&quot;. I saw this on Amazon, I liked the adjustable feature I saw and read about, and so bought it. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase, a professional could not have done a better job than I&#x27;ve done.I would advise reading the instructions first, of course, and do what they suggest. Start out at the highest setting, \\&quot;5\\&quot; and work your way down to the cut you desire until you get used to it, which won&#x27;t take long. Now I cut my hair once a week, number one (lowest) setting, with ease. I&#x27;m saving a lot of money, no way would I pay to go to a barber once a week for a buzz cut. I can&#x27;t speak to those who want to cut at a longer length, but there is a video on Norelco&#x27;s website and they show someone styling his hair inches long. The adjustable blade feature makes this very easy to use, and it&#x27;s very easy to clean, this is a quality product, a great purchase as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
    <li> Exceeded my middle of the road expectations. Cuts reasonably well, a bit awkward for down strokes even though it has angled settings. Overall, faster and easier than my professional clippers.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this item. Stays charged for a long time, lots of different length options, and best of all it cuts consistently. I&#x27;ve had this about a year now and it&#x27;s paid for itself + $100 that I would have spent at supercuts. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who has a simpler-type hairstyle who wants to save money.</li>
    <li> Used this device for all of maybe 5 haircuts.  When I attempted to exchange the trim guards, the blade fell out.  No big deal, it appears to clip in with a little pressure.  Well, it does, assuming the metal holding tabs are perfectly positioned.  Otherwise, if they are not they snap off and this thing is (presto) junk.  I have no idea if the $50 version has a better design, but I won&#x27;t ever know, as I will be moving on to a different brand.</li>
    <li> The shaver has a lot of different shave settings which is great if you want to give yourself a more stylized cut and not just buzz all your hair off. Its a bit wide on the hand, but other than that no complaints. It gets the job done. Hair cuts in NYC are about 35 bucks so I&#x27;m trying to avoid paying that every 3 weeks. I did a good job on my first cut with this machine.</li>
    <li> This clipper is awesome! Easy to use, requires little maintenance. The cordless function is great! The 180 degree clipper will helps you to cut your hair much easier. I&#x27;m left handed so it helps a bit.    To cut hair short, you need to press the clipper firmly against your scalp, then slowly and repeatedly slide it across your scalp.     This is my new favorite hair clipper. It pays itself in little time. Great buy!</li>
    <li> guys!!!! if you are used to cutting your hair with a normal clipper do not buy this one!!!!  even after a year of use.( yes the battery still last long enough for an awkward hair cutting session) it is still challenging to get a nice even cut not to mention it is just awkward using it. Would not recommend!</li>
    <li> From hubby: A very good set of clippers. I am in the military, so I need to be able to cut my hair to regulations. The rotating head on these clippers is a great thing!  I don&#x27;t need to hold the body at an awkward angle and I am able to cut my hair much quicker and with less difficulty. The guards are standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these if you have to cut your hair short on a regular basis. You have a much better chance of not missing a patch of hair here and there.</li>
    <li> This hair clipper is an good investment. No skillz needed. If you cut a patch into your hair with these.... you were  actually trying very hard to do so. I am in the military, and have to trim my hair at least every other week. These clippers hold a good charge.. the battery never died (almost a month without another charge) on me... I just decided to charge it every 3 weeks on \\&quot;Just cause\\&quot; senario. They give a clean/even cut, and without the guide, give a perfect hairline or mustache trim. I dont use the angle adjustments. On a sour note, you cannot BALD/SKIN fade with these clippers. They cut low, but not to the scalp unless you remove the guide.... then you will have a bowl stye haircut. If this unit had adjustable blades then a Skin fade would be possible. Powerful motor, easy adjustments, long battery charge, and few components... by the way what happen to a carry bag?   :-).</li>
    <li> I cut both my beard and hair quite short, and have shopped for nearly a year, spending nearly $500, 8 different clippers (returning most), trying to find something for trimming my own hair. I&#x27;ve used the Norelco Q5170 for several months now and it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.     - The blades are sharp, efficient, don&#x27;t grab and cut cleanly. I can run the blades with or without the comb anywhere on my face, ears, beard, underarms and never get a nick.   - The grooming comb is designed such that hair will not clog up.   - The grooming comb has a clever, effective design. 5 settings with one comb.  - The battery lasts a long time. I&#x27;ve trimmed all my hair and beard four times and it&#x27;s still going strong.  - I thought the 180 degree rotating head was a little silly, but it really makes a difference. You quickly realize that all other clippers, with the blades perpendicular to the barrel, are not ergonomic. Turning the blades parallel with the barrel makes trimming so much easier. Being able to rotate it both ways is an added plus.   - The attachments are very effective (nose hair, and eye brow comb). I can do everything with this single clipper.</li>
    <li> This groomer is much better than my last one from another company. I am able to cut my hair fast and do not have to keep going over and over like my past hair cutter. Very pleased with this purchase. If you like saving money and cutting your own hair, then this is the way to go! Also the price is very good considering that it is warranted for 2 years. I have been using Norelco products for over 20 years and they have served me well.</li>
    <li> This product is only useful when sprucing up between haircuts (neck, sideburns, etc). However, it is a nuisance to use when cutting hair of ANY thickness. I suspect it was not even designed to cut thick hair since it seems to have an internal clutch that disengages the motor when the blades encounter thick hair (the motor keeps humming along as it does absolutely nothing!</li>
    <li> Does not trim as well as a plug in hair trimmer.  Stopped using it and went back to my old plug-in clippers</li>
    <li> I had a Norelco before this one and decided to give this one a shot.  It worked as well as can be expected, but I didn&#x27;t try it on myself.  I had someone else do it.  The pivoting add and various attachments all work well, and it&#x27;s a real breeze having it be cordless and chargeable.      Give it a try!</li>
    <li> This is my first pair of cordless clippers and after using them 3 times I am very impressed. I followed the directions and fully charged them right out of the box and haven&#x27;t had again to yet. I am hoping to get thru at least another cut with them and then will probably plug them in to charge overnight. I keep my hair buzzed pretty close so I use the number one setting. THe piviting head makes it alot easier and quicker to get a good even cut. I think later this summer I may try them without the guard like some of the other reviwers said they did and see how they do cutting REALLY close. BUY THEM IF YOU CUT YOUR OWN.....WON&#x27;T BE DISSAPOINTED.</li>
    <li> I had bought the Remington first, mainly because the QC5170 hadn&#x27;t come out yet, and the Short Cut seemed like a neater product.  And that&#x27;s about the only place I can grade the Remington higher, it truely feels like a comb in your hand.  But what ultimately made me try out the QC5170 was that the Short Cut broke quickly.  After a few uses, it doesn&#x27;t turn on, I think it&#x27;s the power button.  I&#x27;ll send it in to be fixed/repaired eventually, but I decided to go ahead with trying the QC5170, because in the long run it pays for itself after a couple of cuts anyway.    So while the QC5170 doesn&#x27;t feel as good in the hand, it&#x27;s not awkward, and the swivel head comes in handy around the ears.  You get 10 length settings vs the 6 (including balding comb) on the Short Cut, and I found the QC5170 did a better job overall with cutting.  The battery charges in half the time as the Remington (though to me in the grand scheme of things, 16 hrs vs 8 still means it&#x27;s not a quick charge, so it&#x27;ll be plugged in for a while), and in the end I&#x27;m a Norelco fan.  Now I have 3 Norelco electric shavers, and the power bricks are getting confusing.  Time to label them, heh.  Now I just need a Norelco ear/nose trimmer, and I&#x27;ll be set.</li>
    <li> works perfectly fine.    one thing, even with the smaller comb and the size 1 length, it is still a bit long. you cannot cut your hair as short as the picture on the box with this razor.</li>
    <li> I love my barber but have always thought I could cut my own hair.  It seemed straight forward - I am balding and wear my hair short [no. 2 clipper].  I bought the Norelco 180-Degree clipper as an experiment and it works great.  Its very easy to use but it helps to read the instructions which include great tips for getting a clean, even cut.  It also takes some practice.  All in all, the clipper is definitely worth the $35 investment.</li>
    <li> This clipper is really nice. It works really well. My brother volunteered as the ginny pig to test it out lol. I cut it for him and it came out just like it would at a barber shop. Then he did mine. I paid 30 something for it and it pays for itself after 3 uses. After that I am saving money. Haven&#x27;t tried to cut it myself yet but I am sure it would be easy and simple. Can&#x27;t really screw up. I like how the head turns so you can get at the angle you want to make it easier to cut. It comes with a brush to clean it no need for oil or water just use the brush to clean. It selfs sharpens. It also comes with two clip on guides one for short and one for long hair. Comes with a clip to do side burns and a charger. I especially like how it has this red button on the clipper itself to set the clipper at the size you want. I used the short hair clip and set it on 3 for the sides and when I was done I used 4 for the top. Works really nice. I like not having to switch between length clips like other clippers. The only thing I really wish it came with is a case not just to protect the clipper and pieces that came with it but to be able to keep it all in one place. I suggest buying a case for it, I did. All in all it is a fantastic product that pays for itself! It&#x27;s a buy!</li>
    <li> This is a great gadget to save cash, gasoline and time. It is however just for guys who like short hair. I find that the #2 setting is close but not too close for me. It leaves my hair about a quarter inch long. If you have a short flat top or just a short hair cut then it makes sense to migrate to this product.  I&#x27;m happy to say I don&#x27;t endure the beating of the barber shop anymore.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent clipper for people who like to keep their hair under about 3/4\\&quot; in length.  I use it 2-3 times a month to keep my hair close-cropped around 1/4\\&quot;.  The motor is fairly powerful on a full charge.  It&#x27;s light and has a rubber grip area around the outside.  The rotating head is very useful for switching hands to get an all-around cut.  The comb length adjusts with a simple button push.  I usually trim all over at a single length, lower the comb a few notches and then do sides and back.  The smaller trimmer head is also handy for sideburns.  The quality and construction is good -- the trimmer heads and combs snap in securely.  The only thing lacking is some kind of carrying case.</li>
    <li> I keep a short buzz cut.  This clipper has been great for do-it-yourself weekly trimming, and for keeping my beard longer than \\&quot;buzz\\&quot;.  The shape of the body fits great in either hand, in almost any orientation, making it very easy to use on top, back, sides, and especially around the ears.  I find that I&#x27;m not using the swivel feature all that much.  With the comb removed, this clipper makes a great short cut, without hurting or cutting my scalp.    What I really like is the design of the comb and the trimmer head itself.  The comb is cleverly designed - doesn&#x27;t pop off during use, and is sturdy.  I don&#x27;t feel like I will break it or the body of the clipper by taking it on and off repeatedly.  Even better, the trimmer head is easy to take off and on for cleaning, and I do not fear breaking it.  The design of my previous clipper was very flimsy, and ultimately it broke when I popped it off to clean it.  I expect this clipper will last much longer.</li>
    <li> I have bought scores of products from Amazon in the past but have written only a few reviews.  But this product is so good I have to write a review about this one.  In a nutshell, this hair clipper excels in three categories: quality, performance, and value.    QUALITY  Just looking and holding this hair clipper told me instantly that this was a quality product.  I turned the ring that controls the length of hair to any of five positions and it&#x27;s a solid feel.  I lift out the comb from the head and put it back in and I can tell nothing is going to snap off or break.  I pull out the cutters to clean them and put them back in and I can tell that nothing is going to break.  Very very solid.     PERFORMANCE  The clippers are just about as ergonimically perfect as they can be.  Conforms to my hand perfectly.  The clippers come with two interchangeable combs, and each can be set to five lengths.  The first comb can be set from 1/8\\&quot; to about 1/2\\&quot;, and the second comb from 1/2\\&quot; to about 7/8\\&quot;.  Remove the comb and you can cut right to the skin.  I put it through my hair and it clipped like a pro-model.  I couldn&#x27;t tell these clippers were cordless.  To do the back of my head, I easily rotated the head 90 degrees, and I very easily and effectively cut my hair in back.  When I was done, there was only one difference between me doing this myself and paying someone to do it: I couldn&#x27;t shave the hair at the base of my neck, and so I asked my son to do it for me.     VALUE  These clippers will pay for themselves in less than two visits to the barber.  It took me just a few minutes, and the results are professional.  Amazon also had, as usual, the best price, free shipping, and delivery within four days.    FINAL VERDICT  This product is manufactured of the highest quality and it does a professional job without any skill.  The removable parts remove easily and with no likelihood of ever breaking.  It is extremely ergonomic.  It&#x27;s fun to use.  Plus the price is great and warranty long.  My ONLY complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a case, and so I bought one at Walmart for $5.00.  This is truly a superior product.</li>
    <li> Noewlxo norelco does most things well.  Unlike remington, Norelco always has an adequate power source.  You can charge it and it stays charged.  Really, couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair clipper that we have used even though it is not by any means the most expensive. you don&#x27;t have to mess with a different comb every time you want to change the length.  All you do is turn a dial to the number of clipper you want.  The cut is very even and does not leave little hairs sticking up in that one trouble spot.  Definately worth the $30 we paid for it.</li>
    <li> For everyone who suffers from razor bumps these clippers are not for you. You will get break outs like you won&#x27;t believe. I used these clipper once and never again.</li>
    <li> Ordered for Christmas and came sooner than expected.y husband says it handles well and he now does not cut himself shaving even over the bumps in his head. Thanks</li>
    <li> I have to agree with some of the other low reviews of this product, mostly due to two factors: the size of the guards and the actual performance of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw this I was really hoping for more. I had been shaving my head with a beard trimmer for years since I prefer to go under the standard 1/8\\&quot; that many hair clippers use for the minimum. When my trusty Norelco T770 died, I went shopping and was happy to see that there were more products focused on men who buzz their hair regularly. I thought about another beard trimmer, but saw the 180 and thought I&#x27;d give it shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was immediately disappointed with it. Upon initial inspection the guard was noticeably large, and its fat blades seemed to push the hair out of the way rather than guiding it towards the blades. I have to go over everything multiple, multiple times to get an even shave. Considering that I am using the shortest setting (where the hairs should be relatively stiff) this really surprised me. I also have sensitive skin, and running the thing over my head repeatedly can cause irritation that I do not get from other trimmers. The large guard also makes working around the ears and sideburns a task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The OTHER reason that everything has to be done and redone is that the device simply doesn&#x27;t cut hair very well. As soon as it digs in it gives a pulling sensation, like it&#x27;s jammed or dull. I had this problem here and there with beard trimmers, but they were not meant to tear through a full head of hair. This, however, IS. Running over a spot once, with a clean blade, usually results in ~30% of the hair actually being cut. Five or six passes per area are standard for me to get an even cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have relatively thin, fine hair, and for something to pull like that on MY hair is a really bad sign. I -honestly- could not imagine shaving a thick or coarse head of hair with this thing. No wonder they made sure that it had a long battery life: that would take all night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really excited to find dedicated shaved-head trimmers on the market, but this is a perfect example of form over function; Norelco chose to focus more on the &#x27;wow!&#x27; factor than putting a motor in the thing that could do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people seem very happy with this device. I on the other hand ended up paying Batteries Plus $10 to replace the dead battery in my 8-year-old T770 Beard Trimmer. It is almost a decade old, has never been oiled or even properly cleaned, and it runs ugly but effective circles around the QC5170.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco needs to focus on engineering over marketability.</li>
    <li> Cuts &amp; trims hair very well; nice design; nice handle;&lt;br /&gt;It works just fine. Trouble-free to operate; Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;The rotating top definitely comes in handy;</li>
    <li> My hair grows back REALLY fast.  I&#x27;ve been saving a lot of money using this clipper.    Quality construction.  No frills.  Cuts well.  Simple to use.      Only things I wish it had are a battery meter and a quick charge mode.  A red light to indicate charging that never shuts off doesn&#x27;t quite cut it.  8+ hours for a full charge?  It is 2011, right?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a DIY guy that has been cutting my own hair the past couple decades and with this Norelco Clipper everything&#x27;s better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pivoting head and powerful motor make this a breeze to use and the cordless aspect is the greatest.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing makes cutting hair more of a nightmare than dealing with a cord hanging in your face or twisting on your wrist as you try your best to get the back hairs and with this wonderful cordfree clipper those days are gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with 4 attachments,2 for cutting different hair lengths and 1 that&#x27;s a sideburns trimmer and a wider trimmer that works Great for dealing with facial hairs like trimming beards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said,I&#x27;ve been doing this for myself for close to 20 yrs and I finally have a great clipper that eliminates the need of adding oil and the attachments feel sturdy,like they&#x27;ll be around for my use for many years to come without feeling clunky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this Norelco is the way to go,it&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works pretty well. I get a nice even cut all around even in the back. The swiveling head makes it easy to hold as you go around your head.</li>
    <li> This product is great! It is easy to use yourself. No tugging. No irritation. The charge lasts a while, too! Lightweight.</li>
    <li> No complaints; it does what it says it does.  It had no problem cutting through my relatively thick hair.</li>
    <li> Looked like a great product, but it could only cut 1/8 inches.    I was looking for a shorter cut, more like 000 scale blade on Oster or a short cut remington clipper.    I loved the remington short cut clipper but prefer the option that the Philips Norelco offered, a plug in with cord or battery operated, because the battery life on the remington short cut clipper was terrible.    If Philips Norelco had offered a comb attachment that could cut lower than the 1/8 inch cut, I would have kept it.</li>
    <li> I got tired of paying $15-20 for a few minutes of somebody buzzing with clippers and decided to give Philips a try. I got my money back 10 times. Works like a charm. No issues. So, if you are like me and always get a buzz cut - this is a great device.</li>
    <li> I have used the clippers a couple of times now and am very satisfied. They won&#x27;t leave your hair longer than 3/8 inch long which is perfect for me. The 5 settings allows for a tapered appearance on the sides and back with a little as you go tack.  Only issue is changing to the sideburn clippper--I haven&#x27;t pushed very hard for fear of breaking it to pop out the clippers and use the smaller sidburn attachment--as time goes on I&#x27;ll try again.  Good clipper and very sharp.  BTW used to cut back hair also--got 98%.</li>
    <li> The swiveling head is amazingly useful for head shaving, just don&#x27;t let your hair get too long or it pulls. Update: In January, maybe 5 months after I bought it, the battery stopped holding a charge (it lasts less than one trim). So I have to use it plugged in now, which is no big deal. I had fully discharged it a couple times like you&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as a contingency device in case the competitors shortcut clipper that i use, died out as they often do (the shortcut seems to have issues that the manufacturer does not seem to want to address to fix it). I practice and correct any errors with the shortcut.  This device seems to be what the short cut is not (powerful, reliable, reasonably accurate) but just a little less easy to use. This device is lacking in the accurate adjustment between .00 and 1/8\\&quot; cut. It seems to leave an unsightly step between the two lengths that I just cannot compensate for  perhaps an additional \\&quot;Balding\\&quot; type comb that enables the device&#x27;s user friendly application and adjustment between 1/8\\&quot; and .00 can) easily resolve this minor issue. The included comb comes just a bit short of a complete accurate haircut.   I&#x27;ve tried this device with the small comb removed but the outcome allows for an occasional ragged stepped cut and needs to be fixed using the shortcut which easily adjusts down to between 00 and 1/8\\&quot; using the \\&quot;balding comb\\&quot;. Because you cannot blend between 1/8\\&quot; and .00. This may seem trivial but for a do it yourself clipper; resolving this issue might make this device more complete.    With a balding comb to provide for accurate precise adjustment this device might prove to replace the shortcut all together \\&quot;with a little practice\\&quot;.   To resolve this issue an easy fix might be for Phillips work with their customer and to fabricate and offer a balding comb for accurate adjustment down to .00 and provide for additional customer satisfaction (and keep the customer up to date).</li>
    <li> Used it about thrice in the past two months. Haven&#x27;t recharged it yet, so holds a charge well. I&#x27;ve used with without the plastic runners (used to adjust the height of the cut) because I wanted the closest cut (about 1/2 a millimeter), and it&#x27;s worked well (the manual mentions that you can use it that way).   The rotating head is a nice to have, but I haven&#x27;t really used the rotation because the body itself is pretty light and rounded - so fits well in the hand at different angles.</li>
    <li> So, got this as a gift. Seems sorta nice, but after the first pass there didnt seem to be a lot of hair that fell onto the floor, so I went and looked in a mirror. It seems that with each pass the first inch or so would cut, but then the rest of the hair would just get combed or something. I tried making my passes faster, i tried slower. Didnt help, in fact with slow it actually started pulling my hair. So, I then realized that each pass could only be very short and then i had to let it get rid of the hair that it had first before moving on. Got fed up and went back to my old clippers that are getting a bit worn but they CUT HAIR 10X better than this thing.</li>
    <li> With great trepidation I cut my hair and trimmed my beard 1 day after receiving this clipper.  It was a breeze...easy to use and I am very pleased with the results.  I just wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to \\&quot;to do it myself\\&quot;.  Highly recommended.  BTW, the 60 minute charge isn&#x27;t an issue; it took me 10 minutes tops to trim my beard and my hair!  The swivel head is a terrific idea and it helped significantly.  Oh, and a great price to boot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few other brands (Remington Shot Cut, Wahl Self Kit) and they always break within a year. The Norelco doesn&#x27;t seem as cheep or flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The QC5170 feels solid in the hand, it easy to use, has a much (MUCH) better battery than the competition, and does a good job at a close trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep my hair really short, so I use the closest setting. It cleans up easy and adjusts solidly to avoid setting-slippage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you (like me) want to save time and money, this is a great tool.</li>
    <li> I recently started shaving my head clean - although \\&quot;shaving\\&quot; is a bit dramatic because I&#x27;m really just taking off the extension and using the trimmer directly on my skull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 180-degree rotating head is the nice part.  Since the trimmer is wide (compared to a beard trimmer) it can sometimes get more of my rounded skull at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and have only used a beard trimmer previously so I can&#x27;t judge if it cuts well or not, which seems to be the major sticking point for most reviewers.  All I know is the trim is as close as my beard trimmer was and once I&#x27;ve trained my hands to use it better I&#x27;ll be able to say if it cuts well or not.  For now, I like it.</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper for a gift. I have one for my husband and really liked it. I have always cut his hair and this clipper is so easy to use. It cuts perfectly and being that it is cord/cordless makes it even better. When my husband tried it on his own it was easy to clip his hair using the 180 degree head. It holds a long charge. the only thing I wish it had on it was like norelco razors have a gauge letting you know when it is getting low on battery power and a light to tell you when it is fully charged.</li>
    <li> I purchased the QC5170 clipper after having bad luck with Remington and Whal clippers. The QC5170 clipper has excellent power for a cordless. Since they are self sharpening and do not need oiling, they are ready to go in a moment. I have only used them once but am very happy with this product. My hair cut was quick and even. The clippers glided over my head without the nicking and bleeding I came to expect with my previous clippers. The only drawback I see with this product is the lack of a storage case or bag. I consider the price of these clippers reasonable and money well spent. I would rate the product a 5 if a case or bag had been included with the clippers.</li>
    <li> Even though I have been hair-challenged for years, I was still paying $20+ for a \\&quot;haircut\\&quot;. A hair-challenged guy at work turned me on to this hair clipper. It is the greatest thing since my hot comb I had in highschool. It takes about 5-6 minutes for me to completely cut my hair. It&#x27;s simple to use, easy to clean (I just blow it a couple times) and with all the money I&#x27;m saving, I may call the hair club for men. Until then, keep on cutting. The only negative I have is there is no case to store the pieces in. Luckily I had a plastic bag from the Gap.</li>
    <li> Replaced a Remington Short cut with this Philips Norelco and couldn&#x27;t imagine going back.    Positives:  1 - Easy to use attach adjustable clipper head.4  2 - Pivot head comes in very handy for going around ears. (which has always been an issue)  3 - Handle is easy to hold on to, isn&#x27;t round or too far away from the cutting blades.  4 - I am able to cut my hair myself without concern for missing or not properly blending.  5 - 2 blades X 5 settings per blade for length.  6 - Ability to use while charging - seems small but when a battery dies halfway through your cut believe me you will wish every clipper had this.    Hope this helps, I have been cutting my hair for 3+ years now and this is the best clipper I have used</li>
    <li> Received the Philips Norelco QC5170 180-Degree Hair Clipper short after I placed the order. Used it once so far. Happy with the final results. Recommend it to everyone that wants to cut their own hair, since it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Got a great deal on this and so far seems to be a great product.  Makes giving urself a haircut a lot easier.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the clippers so far.  Have used them 4 times without recharging yet.  Nice to know I can use plugged in with the charger if needed (haven&#x27;t needed to yet).  Fairly even cut, although I cut with the closest setting, so really don&#x27;t know how well it works at longer settings.  The rotating head is handy sometimes, but can be awkward at other times.  Overall glad I bought them.</li>
    <li> Among the other brands I tried so far, this is the best.     I wish they also had the trimmer function.   So far, cordless use is excellent.</li>
    <li> First let me say that I generally keep my hair buzzed (until my 4 year old daughter told me to, \\&quot;stop and let my head be hairy.\\&quot;) I used a Wahl (which is by far the best buzzer I have ever used). Getting the Norelco 180-Degree Hair Clipper is a night and day difference. Some things are better and some things are worse. I should note that the wall is NOT a hair trimmer, and you really couldn&#x27;t use it to trim long hair. The Norelco is much better. However, it is less heavy duty, meaning that your hair must be washed and gel/hairspray/etc., free. The problem is that you then need to take another shower to get all the little hair clippings off of you. Also, the unit feels a little flimsy and does not make you feel that it was very well constructed. Not that I have had ANY problems with it. And, it may be that I am just used to the sold feel of my Wahl. The greatest thing about this unit is that it is wireless. No cords to get in your way or tangle you up. I have pretty fine hair and it cut very easily. (I will update it in a few months if the cutting ability changes). You do need to let it fully charge before using it. The ability to change angles seems like a great idea, but I did not find it particularly useful (again, this might be because my Wahl did not have this feature and I am just accustomed to it) and in order to change the angle you need to turn it with a ratchet type of action. I will also note, having mentioned my Wahl several times, that the Norelco is LESS than half the price. The batttery holds a charge well and the motor did not bog down cutting my hair (remember that I said my hair is pretty fine). This is not something I would use on facial hair for several reasons, including fear of dulling the blade and draining the battery faster. I still have a few concerns over the plastic construction of this unit, and I am afraid to break it. As I mentioned, this may be totally unfounded. Lastly, you do not have a lot of choices in hair length here if you wishto keep your hair relatively long (and have no idea how to cut hair). Otherwise, this is a good product. Oh, I should also mention that this is a little intimidating to young children as my 5.5 year old son refused to let me near him because it looked like it had teeth. LOL. His hair is very thick, and when I finally get him to let me cut his hair I will post an update. I think that you can buy this with confidence that you will use it and not just be a gadget that is used only once and then put away.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be a great for a short style or bald.  I works much better than the other ones I have tried and cuts much more evenly</li>
    <li> The clipper works very well--my only problem is that the longest setting is still too short.  I wish Norelco would have added another attachment for a longer hair style.</li>
    <li> Best hair clipper on the market if you buzz your own head.  Guards are a little shorter or tighter than most other clippers.  Go one notch  higher than you are used to until you get the feel of it. I&#x27;m on my second unit. first one lasted 5 years of twice weekly use.</li>
    <li> Bought this clipper when I finally decided I was tired of my hair and wanted a no maintenance buzz cut.  The clipper arrived on time...2 days.  I had never used a clipper before or cut my own hair, so I was a bit apprehensive about the whole process.  Actually read the instructions, just to make sure I would not cut some design into my hair.  With caution I did a first cut with the setting on 5....definitely too long still.  Next cut was on 4.....better, but still too long.  3 rd and final cut was on 3 ......perfection!  Now I just use that same setting about once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clipper is so comfortable to handle.  Much smaller than your typical clipper.  The head swivels left or right, or you can keep it straight.  This makes it so easy to work with both hands and get a nice even cut all over.  The blades are self sharpening and give a nice, painless trim.  This clipper is rechargeable, and can be used with or without the cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this clipper, whether you are cutting your own or someone elses hair.  I have found nothing to complain about this clipper.  On a scale of 1 to 5, I would rate it a 10!</li>
    <li> Pretty impressed with the product: it has a decent battery life, good motor, and its easy to use. Two comments: it&#x27;s not too hard to reach the back of your head but it&#x27;s hard to really clean up the neck hair and bottom part unless you have another mirror and then its slightly awkward. I know it defeats the purpose but the best bet is to have a friend clean up the back of your head. The other reservation and I will have to use this product more to fully know, but it seems that when you do a closer shave it cuts your hair in rows and you can see small lines of empty space in your scalp when instead there should be hair.</li>
    <li> Great clipper. Love privoting head. Only problem was understanding the directions.  Would recommend it highly especially if you have Amazon points which made the razor costs me less than 10 bucks.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works great. It cuts better than other hair trimmers.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift to my son, who has to have his wife shave his head cause he can&#x27;t reach the whole thing himself. This clipper proved useless to him cause he was unable to get it as close as he likes. He&#x27;d discarded the box so I was unable to return it.</li>
    <li> My wife has been cutting the boys hair at home about once a month since they were little (the eldest is now 15). When I told her I bought the QC5170 clipper for her she was not sure how it would work with the swivel head and the overall unusual design. After using it for a couple of hair cuts she says it is the best hair clipper she has ever used. The swivel head is very handy, the comb adjustments are perfect and best of all, hair clippings do not get stuck in the comb like other Philips and Panasonic clippers we had. All in all it is a great product and worth the money, we love it.</li>
    <li> I use this every two weeks and have not had to pay for a haircut in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I loved it. So eaasy to use and effective too. I don&#x27;t have to waste so much money going to barber shop for trimming my hair now.</li>
    <li> I based my purchase of this item on the reviews from other Amazon buyers. Unfortunately, I was led astray from the fact that this clippers is not very good at cutting hair. The features are nice and the length control is slick - but after 45 minutes of chopping away at my hair, I was less than enthused. Finally had to use a scissors to finish the job. I have cut my own hair with three other clippers that have all been old, but I have never encountered a clippers with as little talent as this one.</li>
    <li> Ok so I only used this one time so far but it did what it was supposed to do. Clip hair! I have no idea why there are so may complainers about this product. Ok maybe a case for the clippers might have been nice but I&#x27;ll pick one up for five bucks. It worked right out of the box. I had my hair shaved down (I used the shortest setting) in about 7 minutes. You might need someone to help you clean up the lower back of your neck with a pair of smaller trimmers for a straight line but that&#x27;s about it. I love this product and I will be saving me $25 a trip to the hair salon every month. I will give an update if I have any problems with this product or any updates if needed.</li>
    <li> The clipper worked for about 6 months like a charm, and the swivel design was very helpful. I keep short-cropped hair and beard and used the machine once every week. After 6 months the little engine started to sputter and the motor didn&#x27;t have enough strength to cut my short hair, even after the additional charge. I have to shake and nod the clipper to finish the job. It&#x27;s not an expensive clipper, and maybe this time the price indicated the quality. I need to buy the new one and don&#x27;t even know whether it make sense for me to use the warranty for the Philips clipper. I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The Norelco hair clipper works fine just find the right head for the lengthy you want and move slowly against the way the hair lays. I have used it a few times now and I don&#x27;t plan on ever paying for another haircut.</li>
    <li> Bought this for myself cuz i like to keep my hair short but it grows back real fast so don&#x27;t really wana spend $$$ every week. The 180 degree feature really helps with the sides and im really impress with its battery life so far. I gave it a 4star because the material seems fragile so it might break easy.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy a hair clipper on Amazon, this machine is great! very easy to handle and charge. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Received used goods.  Found human hair in clipper.  Now I know why it was returned by previous owner.  Blade was dull which didn&#x27;t cut right, instead it was pulling my hair.  It took multiple tries to have a clean shave.  Too bad I threw the box away...</li>
    <li> This is really easy to use.  My hair is very short so it needs cutting often.  This cordless trimmer (if you want) is always ready!</li>
    <li> While this isn&#x27;t the fanciest or the most expensive self hair cutter on Amazon it works great for me and cuts my hair very evenly. I usually keep my hair fairly short so I decided to save the $20 I spend every month to get my hair cut and do it myself. Since I only spent $22 on this cutter it seemed like a good gamble for me to try it. It has several different settings for how long (or short) you like your hair and it&#x27;s rechargeable so you don&#x27;t have to deal with a cord while you&#x27;re trying to cut your hair. With my first self haircut I did a single length, but I think I&#x27;m going to try for a longer on top an shorter on the sides next time and see how that goes. This should save me $250 per year on haircuts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for more than two years now and it&#x27;s still working like new. Haven&#x27;t experienced anything negative With it. Easy to clean and maintain and I love that it has a built in rechargeable battery which can be used while plugged in.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  My husband can buzz down his hair on his own when he wants to.  It also does a great job with removing back, arm and chest hair.  Would re-order, for sure.</li>
    <li> The clippers are good.  The interchangeable heads will not last and&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to see that you could not purchase the heads separately.</li>
    <li> Quality is so so, used it 5 times and already an abnormal vibration in the metal teeth, is waterproof which is nice</li>
    <li> If your willing to save on hair cuts at the shop then I would get it.Cuts ok. . . .</li>
    <li> I have used this clipper for about 6 weeks, cutting my hair weekly on the #2 setting.  The #2 setting gets the short length haircut that I desired - it is an even cut (when slowly done), takes about 5 minutes.  The battery lasted for about 6 haircuts, 5 minutes per haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the downside - there is no indicator of remaining battery charge and the clipper charge ran-out on my last cut.  Also, an amber light comes on while recharging but it does not turn green when the charging is complete, it stays amber and there is no indication of when the charging is complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this clipper for anyone desiring a short haircut requiring no assistance.  That said, the star system doesn&#x27;t really mean anything in a review of a clipper; after all, it&#x27;s just a clipper - how excited can you get?</li>
    <li> These clippers are wonderful! The ease of use with the rotating head makes it so easy to cut your own hair. The rotating head just follows the contour of your head, and makes it super easy to cut. As long as you can figure out that everything is backwards in the mirror you are fine! They never pulled at my hair when I used them so they are super sharp. They&#x27;re far superior to other Wahl clippers I&#x27;ve tried that just rip out your hair. I would highly recommend these Norelcos. Can&#x27;t beat the price too!</li>
    <li> The product is excellent. The pivoting head greatly reduces problems during cutting, especially when cutting one&#x27;s own hair, as I do. The price is right, it works as advertised, and it greatly simplifies cutting ones hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent results. The cordless feature is the best. Also, I find the 180 degree feature is especially useful when cutting my own hair which is 90% of the time.</li>
    <li> I use this to trim my son&#x27;s hair, since his hair grows like weeds.  With the hair length adjusters, it&#x27;s easy for a buzz cut, and simple enough to trim off the sideburns and back of the neck.    Quiet, yet powerful enough motor.  Since I use it for my son, I don&#x27;t really use the angling feature, which would normally allow one to rotate the head.  And since I don&#x27;t have a beard myself, I can&#x27;t use that feature either.    Especially for young kids, though, it&#x27;s nice to have this cordless model, since they can&#x27;t yank on the cord while you&#x27;re working on holding a squirming kid with one hand and cutting hair with the other.  The battery length has been good for me, but again, I use this only weekly at most.    Again, overall, for my use, it does its job, and well.  Just can&#x27;t speak to its full functionality.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> I just returned from Asia and don&#x27;t like the hair cuts or prices in the States. Since I maintain a simple crew-cut I decided to try cutting my own hair. I bought the Philips QC5170 180 and am satisfied. Since I don&#x27;t have any style needs I just mow it down from front to back going against the grain of the hair growth. Works great for a clean-cut look. The 180 swivel clipper makes it easier to get the odd angles at the back and sides.</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my own hair for few years now. Used few other product. This Philips is the best one I owned. fits easy in your hand has a convenient rotating head that makes it even easier to use . It charges fast and runs longer on the charge. If you don&#x27;t like to go to the barber and wait to have your hair cut, this is your best choice.</li>
    <li> I used this for a WHOLE YEAR, religiously. Just get it. It works great and lasts long. What else do you want?!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 2 years and they still work wonderfully. The battery doesn&#x27;t charge as much, but wired it still functions wonderfully. I will say I no longer use the 180-degree turning since the small body and contours allow me to just keep it straight and use comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;Cuts are consistent without skipping or getting jammed.</li>
    <li> This clipper works great, it&#x27;s very easy to use. I believe it has paid for itself already. No more going to the barber.</li>
    <li> There are many positives with this new Norelco Hair Clipper. It is cordless- the best feature! A single attachment is needed as opposed to four different attachments with other razors. Motor noise is reduced. Also the blades need no oiling.  Some negatives- A battery indicator would be nice. A case or bag would be handy when traveling. A quicker charge would also be   a good addition. (1-2 hours vs. the current 8 hrs.)  Overall, I am very pleased with the Norelco 5100. The overall smoother cut paired with a quieter motor, fewer attachments to complete the job, and being cordless has me moving my currently used clippers to a box in the garage.</li>
    <li> I ordered this trimmer mainly because I&#x27;m Spanish and my thick mop of hair tends to grow quickly. I like my hair neat and trim and going to the barber every 2 weeks is expensive and time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m no expert at cutting hair I&#x27;ll admit - especially my own. But my intentions were to simply keep the side of my hair and around my ears and neck in control until my regular barber visit. The Philips Norelco QC5170 is perfect for the job I had in mind and has performed flawlessly so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ll start with what I like. The QC5170 is very lightweight which is helpful in preventing hand/wrist fatigue. The head of the unit can articulate 90 degrees in either direction for hard to reach areas. The blades are supposedly self-sharpening and don&#x27;t require oil or a lot of user attention. The unit also comes with a built-in rechargeable battery and charging cable. Not having to fumble around with a cord is a fantastic feature and makes clipping your own hair much easier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 2 reasons why I didn&#x27;t give this unit a 5-star rating. First, the unit doesn&#x27;t come with a case. That means all the attachments and cord are sitting in a bathroom drawer and unorganized. Second, I really wish this unit had a built-in vacuum. I&#x27;ve been using this unit for about the last 2 months and recently borrowed a friends Philiphs Noreclo with a built-in vacuum and it was great not creating a huge mess every time I cut my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though it&#x27;s a very nice clipper for the price. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Bought this a few weeks ago and used it to cut my own hair. Overall it works great. The unit is very light and easy to handle. Practical swivel head, easy to swap length gaurds, and corded/cordless options. The only criticim I have is that the longest length gaurd still cut my hair pretty short so if you&#x27;re going for a longer length on your sides or back, you&#x27;ll have to guestimate rather than trust the length gaurd.</li>
    <li> MYSTERY SOLVED: To get this clipper to cut hair short, you must hold the unit  flat against your head and press it firmly against your scalp, and then slowly and repeatedly slide it across your scalp.  Otherwise, it just slides over your head without cutting.  At first, I thought something was wrong with the unit.  But after a little experimenting, I found that I could hear it cutting hair, and as I continued, I discovered the unit is an ergonomic masterpiece.  It&#x27;s easy to hold, and the rotating cutting head makes it easy to properly position for cutting hair on different parts of your own head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was surprised by the way my hair looked when I was finished.  I thought I had been getting an even haircut before, but this was visibly more even, even at a very short length.  I am now enthusiastic about the results I get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use an Andis trimmer to trim the hair off the back of my neck because I already had it, and it works well.  Maybe the Norelco unit&#x27;s other trimming head which snaps into place would work alright there; I just haven&#x27;t needed to try it.  But I&#x27;m giving this unit a five-star review based upon the phenomenally even cut I get and the ease of use.  Another plus is that the blades on this trimmer require no lubrication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why this unit provides such an unusually even cut.  Maybe the blades are incredibly sharp.  But you must hold the unit flat against your head and press it firmly against your scalp to get it to cut short hair.</li>
    <li> Mine was not a good one... Granted, we all know that there can be some defective products from the manufacturing process even if perfectly designed. But in my case, the rotating part of the clipper does not fit into the main body of the product, which is a sign of design defect. Immediately returned. Not a good one!</li>
    <li> Dead and useless after 3 and half years.  Get a plug in model and save your money.</li>
    <li> I bought these clippers over 2 years ago, and they have been working great.  My friend asked me to send him the information on these clippers, so I logged on my past order to send him this info.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 years ago, I paid $21.74 with free shipping for these clippers... Why are they so expensive now?!!?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, fantastic product for what I paid for it, dont get the price increase.</li>
    <li> Everything is perfect! Thank you very much! That is what I wanted! I will definitely enjoy using this item and I hope it is very useful!</li>
    <li> I will say this, the rotating head feature IS a nice feature.  However, if I didn&#x27;t have it, this would have only gotten 2 stars.      I previously owned a 20 dollar, small standard buzzer from Philips Norelco.  The only reason I replaced it was because I lost the adjustable clip that determines the hair length.  I got this one thinking, \\&quot;hey, I save a lot of money cutting my own hair, why not have a nice buzzer?\\&quot;  Well, this one is just OK.      The rotating head is nice, easy to use, and does make holding the thing a lot easier. The clips themselves sap in and out very easily.  Adjusting the hair length is quite simple, but not easy enough to do my accident.  It&#x27;s larger size makes holding easy also, but at the drawback of making fine jobs hard, like around the ears, and the back of the neck.  Also, maybe it&#x27;s in the manual, but there&#x27;s no reference to ACTUAL length on the clips or buzzer.  It comes with a large clip, and a small clip, and both adjust to 5 lengths.  No telling what those lengths really are until you start cutting.      The cutting itself seems sub par.  I&#x27;m not snagging my hair much, but it just feels like I have to retrace over areas again and again.  It&#x27;s almost like my hair feels finer with this buzzer, managing to outwit the blades and pass unscathed.      That&#x27;s about it really.  It works.  I use it.  But for the finer detail stuff, I use my old, smaller buzzer, since I don&#x27;t need the adjustable clip for that stuff.</li>
    <li> One of the best hair clippers I have ever owned!  The ability to rotate the clipper maked it easy to trim the back hair! The charge holds thru many hair cuts, and if it runs out of charge, the power cord enables operation to complete the hair cutting!</li>
    <li> I hate haircuts. I used to procrastinate until it became an emergency, even though I have very little hair left and just ordered the male pattern baldness version of the crew cut. A couple of years ago I was so nettled when I saw the waiting line at the barber shop that I went straight home and cut it all off. Bald. Problem solved.    But my wife never really liked it and I have to say I didn&#x27;t either. So I decided to let it grow a little and try the do-it-yourself approach, returning to a short, uniform length hair style. After reading reviews and thinking about how I use the razor to shave my head, I chose the Norelco rechargeable clippers. The rotating head made a lot of sense to me,  and elimination of the power cord seemed to eliminate a real potential for annoyance. I think I made the right decision and am delighted.    I thought the procedure would be for me to take a basic hack at it and then let my wife even it out. However after my first effort, my wife went over a few spots and told me there really wasn&#x27;t anything to do. Ten minutes and done--well, maybe a little longer the first time. As a result of shaving my head, I am used to the grain of my hair and how to gauge the cut by feeling the scalp. So maybe my learning curve wasn&#x27;t as steep as it might be for someone who has never tried cutting his own hair. However, this is not rocket science and the guide combs make it pretty hard to goof up.    This is a nice gadget and I like gadgets. The clippers are very comfortable in my hand and the build quality is excellent. Charge is probably sufficient for several haircuts (i.e., for my hair), and the clipper blades themselves seem quite efficient. In other words, they seem to cut cleanly and evenly and don&#x27;t \\&quot;chew\\&quot; on the hairs. From the instructions, I am pretty sure the batteries are NiCad, so don&#x27;t overcharge them. Now, rather than having a nice haircut that will deteriorate into a mess every few weeks, I can stay on top of the situation. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Between the two trimmers there is 10 adjustable settings.  Easy to clean and the head swivels (clicks in place) for easier handling.  Battery life has lessened but its still a great product.</li>
    <li> I tried this Norelco trimmer and it was a piece of junk,  I used it a few times and tossed it out.  Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco QC5170 180-Degree Hair Clipper is the best hair clipper I have used.  It is well built and the self sharpening feature does worked as advertised.</li>
    <li> Easy to operate w/180degree rotating head.  You have to take your time to get use to all the settings.</li>
    <li> not bad. still got it but like my other Norelco with double a batteries better. does the job just not overwhelmed with this product by any means.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Does and excellent job.</li>
    <li> AT $200 NOT WORTH IT. The Low Comb WILL BREAK in time !!!!  Battery could be better as in other Norelco and Braun products but O.K. for the price.  Had it a while and I am satisfied with my reluctant new look.  Con: Needs a shorter or stubble setting. The more you use it, the direction of hair growth randomizes (thin hair) and requires repeated use. A shorter setting would look even better and require less cutting sessions per month.  Easy and safe to use and is very ergonomic.</li>
    <li> This razor did a nice job.  I buzz my hair with it.  The only complaint is that it does on me within 1 1/2 to 2 years of getting it.  I won&#x27;t waste my money on it again. Get a corded trimmer.</li>
    <li> I have been using these clippers for a couple of months now. They work ok but do not give me a completely even cut compared to my old wahl clippers. These also take significantly longer to cut the same amount of hair as my wahl clippers, but they are more comfortable/easy to use. As far as the cordless aspect goes, it seems you have to charge them for a LONG period of time to get thru one haircutting session ( about 20-30 mins of use). I used it plugged in my last go-round and it worked great. The length guard dial works wonders! I think these clippers would be better suited for short term hairstyle maintenance (every 1-2 weeks) as opposed to full blown haircuts. So bottom line, if you find these at a good price don&#x27;t hesitate to buy them, they will serve you well.</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for a couple of years now. The 180º swivel makes it possible to cut with either hand when you go from one side of your head to the other.</li>
    <li> I have been using this clipper for years</li>
    <li> can cut my own hair with this fast, haven&#x27;t had a real barber haircut in a while and probably never will again.  Tips:  Put the longest comb on and set it to 5.  Cut back and sides only most of the time and cut the top maybe once a year and only comb though each section of the top once, tends to take a little too much off the top if you cut it everytime unless ultra short hair is what you are going for.</li>
    <li> I just got this product, saw mixed reviews online, and so far after cutting my hair I really think its a great product. would recommend to anyone who wants to cut their own hair.</li>
    <li> We wanted some replacement hair clippers for our old Norelco ones on which the battery died. My criteria were pretty simple: I wanted something that would cut well, wouldn&#x27;t be too loud if possible, and most importantly was not only rechargeable, but also could be used plugged in (we had too many occasions with the previous ones where the battery died and it wouldn&#x27;t run plugged in so my 9 year old son had to go round with half a haircut till the clippers had charged up again!). This one met all the criteria and was inexpensive, so we got it. It does all of the things specified above; I&#x27;d have liked something a little quieter (so my son can watch TV more easily while having his hair cut), but it&#x27;s no noisier than the old ones. The 180-degree thing was neither here nor there for me, but I have found I do use that when cutting my own hair, so there you go, it is handy. So, overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Works as it says.  It is much easier to use than a regular clipper.  Simply the fact that the guide has a spring makes it great.  It is a little odd that the hair length settings are a little different than the standard clippers.  I used to use a 2, but now a 2 seems too short so I am using a 3...  a little different, but it works.</li>
    <li> I bought it for a balding  friend and he loves it</li>
    <li> I use this everyday.  I am getting follickly challenged and keep my hair clipped extremely short.  I set this on #1 and 1 minute daily keeps my hair evenly trimmed nicely....but a barber out of work!</li>
    <li> Floating hinge is just a gimmick and the re chargeable battery only lasted 4 charge cycles. Forget this one and go with one of the Wahl products for less money.</li>
    <li> If one reads the instructions. 1. charge it for 8 hours before using and run the battery down before recharging. 2. Pick the hair lenght comb you desire, start long. This baby works perfectly. Your barber could use this and no one would be the wiser. It have plenty of power and cuts very evenly. Super buy for the price and I don&#x27;t believe my barber will see me ever again. Feel kinda sad for her.</li>
    <li> This does what I needed and is not that hard to get used to.  No complaints.  Very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Most reviewers seem to like this hair clipper so I feel a bit self conscious contributing a less than stellar review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for many years for several reasons. The cost savings is not as imporant to me as the time saved by not having to sit in a barber shop waiting. I&#x27;m also concerned about the sanitary aspect of having a stranger cut my hair with tools used on who knows how many people. I&#x27;ve been using this particular clipper as my only hair cutting impliment for about a year and a half, and although the rotating head is sometimes helpful I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that it&#x27;s  mainly a gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can live with the gimmicky aspect of the rotating head. What makes the clipper unsatisfactory is the fact that it is quite underpowered. I don&#x27;t understand why because my hair is thin and like many men my age, there&#x27;s not much hair on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the #3 setting and in order to get an even cut of the proper short length I need to go over...and over...and over my head for at least 10-15 minutes. No matter how clean or dry my hair is this machine slows way down when cutting my hair. I never let my hair grow more than two inches in total length, so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m trying to cut very long hair. And my hair is thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does get the job done, but with quite a bit of repetitive cutting. It seems to take forever and misses most of the longer, stray hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really recommend this clipper based on my experience. Nevertheless, most people seem to like it. So who am I to disagree...</li>
    <li> I use this to shave my head to a number 1 and it works flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;Since the initial charge I&#x27;ve used it for over a month too. Usually I use it every 2 weeks for about 15-20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is a breeze, and I even use it to trim my full face beard. Just put it on # 2 and run it across.&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned about other reviewer saying the plastic is flimsy and might poke you. Rubbish.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re trimming your face man! Not you lawn ha ha. Just be careful and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> swivel head makes it very easy to cut my own hair. lightweight and head swivels easily, not too noisy, comfortable to hold</li>
    <li> ...the rotating blade is very handy. Only negative is that if your looking for real short - this wont do the trick. This was to replace a previous Norelco - whose 2 setting cuts closer than this one&#x27;s 0!</li>
    <li> The rotating head provides ease of using the clipper when changing hands.  The adjustment for depth of cut is easy to adjust can be moved while the clipper is running.</li>
    <li> The guards are flimsy with teeth that break easily.</li>
    <li> Works great. I&#x27;ve stopped visiting my barber. But fine hair can be a little difficult to get at in the back-bottom.</li>
    <li> This will work if you are giving yourself a buzz cut for the summer.  Just for fun I tried giving my self a standard type haircut...ie....longer on top etc...... did not look too pretty....sooo after my little experiment I went into buzz cut mode and it worked just fine.  so if you like a buzz cut for summer you can save yourself the cost of a barber for three or four months a year.</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper off a recommendation from my sister and brother-in-law.  I have been happy with the simplicity of the unit and the fact that the head swivels around makes cutting my own hair a breeze!  Great product for someone who is balding and keeps their hair cut short all the time!  One issue is that the built in battery runs out of juice too soon so I have found that keeping it plugged in all the time while cutting my hair gives the best cut (faster action by the cutter).  I would suggest this unit or something similar..</li>
    <li> This is a good product but it works better if you keep it on the cord which defeats the purpose a bit. Still, its well made and I enjoy using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m satisfied using  the hair Clipper.It cut my hair and it is easy to operate it.  I recommended my friends to buy a hair clipper like this</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer a couple of months ago, read a lot of negative reviews onit, it doesn&#x60;t cut, bla bla..&lt;br /&gt;since I had it, I have not experienced a single problem with anything, it cuts perfect, the battey life is very good, overall, it&#x60;1s an excellent product for the price u&#x60;d pay</li>
    <li> I do a 2 guard length, all over. I can&#x27;t comment about fades, tapers or blending. But as far as 1 length goes it&#x27;s 5 star. So why the 4 stars overall rating. Well the motor is not the most powerful. I hear the motor slowing down, so I have to slow down. If you cut your hair every 2 or 3 weeks, you should be able to get it done pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I don&#x27;t trim my neck, I usually do 1 or 2 DIY haircuts and then a  barber cut. I&#x27;ve probably saved a couple hundred dollars, so it has paid for itself and saved me money. If the newer models work as good as this one, I would say buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid $30 for mine, so I&#x27;m not sure what these hundreds of dollars price tags are about.</li>
    <li> Great clippers, do a wonderful job of cutting my hair. Love the cordless design. Battery life could be a little better but that&#x27;s my only real complaint. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> its good  works for me.Wishit had a narrow adaptor for goinfg around the ears. I have already saved $300 for hair cuts. Paid for itself in just 3 months!</li>
    <li> I have a very simple short hair style and this clipper does exactly what I wanted to do with my hair, when it actually works. Here is the detail: I ordered one from amazon and was very happy with it until all of a sudden it stopped working. I called Phillips and they shipped me a replacement. After a few weeks it again stopped working just like the first one, which got me curious and I opened it up, found nothing wrong, after putting everything back, it started again. Then I realized that when it stopped working I could help the rotor get started by touching the rotating head, annoying but I can live with it. After another few months, the charging indicator was dead, but it seemed to still being charged. Shortly after that it&#x27;s completely dead. The fact that same problem happened to two of them indicates design defects, hopefully a newer model could address such an issue. Otherwise it saved me hundreds on haircut over the last year or so.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco QC5170 180-Degree Hair Clipper is the best hair clipper for home user and my son love it.&lt;br /&gt;Affordable</li>
    <li> very good clipper especially when you cut your own hair. Blades are very sharp and works good with the battery for the entire session of cutting your hair. I love the adjustable height plus the 180 degree rotating blade is superb!!!</li>
    <li> I use it for self-haircutting (i have long hair and prefer to save them), the what important for this technique - is the mirrors - to see the back. It can be used to make long-haircuts, but with some learning. For short-cuts or no-hair - it is the most ideal device and the most easy to do without mirrors. It&#x27;s weight (the device only with one attachment) is near 190 grams, very comfy for hands design. After 4 years from purchase it&#x27;s still works, the internal battery is little degraded and not holding the charge for long, but you can use it with power adapter plugged in - universal voltage (100-240v), so you can use it worldwide. What is missing - i would prefer to get the some case for storing it with all it&#x27;s accessories. I&#x27;m shocked how expensive it today - 4 years ago it was only $40 (with shipping).</li>
    <li> Quick review. I&#x27;ve had these clippers for over 5 years. Blades are amazing, cut well even now after all this use. I use the clippers probably every other week.&lt;br /&gt;The good: blades are great, stay sharp, cut flawlessly and clean. I think the feature is that these are self-sharpening. So that really does work. Slower passes yield better cutting results when cutting. Otherwise sometimes will start slowing down if going too fast. Design is neat with the swivelling head. It really makes the job easier when cutting the back of the head and sides. Grip is very natural and ergonomic.&lt;br /&gt;Not so good: These are the reasons i didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars. The length guards have a little retention clip at the base. That clip can break off very easily and the length guard will be falling out. This is annoying but fixable with some hot glue gun. The plastic is good for the case, but the clip is too small and plastic is too brittle. Another thing is the batteries will go out soon and you can&#x27;t replace them without opening the thing up and soldering in new ones. Just recently the on-off button quit working. I opened it up and some small pieces of hair got stuck inside the button and insulated the contacts. This is all fixable of course but annoying.&lt;br /&gt;Overall the clippers performed great for as long as they have. I would recommend this product. Thanks for reading.</li>
    <li> Its cool to look at.  Its blades are very sharp.  It has several moveable positions/directions for self cutting.  Its short but not too bulky. Its ONLY FOR short and very short hair styles. Like 1/2 inch maximum. I have purchased several different products from Philips and am disappointed with ALL of them.  They start with a great idea, add a few bells and whistles but dont really deliver.  I demand perfection or pretty close.  As a retired Designer, Im always looking for the extra, extra details. Perfection is always in the details. Another higher cutting head attachment allowing up to 2 1/2 - 3 inch height would knock out the competition and make this Spectacular instead of Limited.  Enjoy</li>
    <li> for the mathematicians... every visit to the barber shop ranges 15 to 20 bucks/visit plus tips...(in my experience, sometimes you arent happy with the haircuts -reason why Ive been cutting my own hair since I was 21yo-) say you get 1 hair cut per month that equals to 180-240 bucks per year! so if you get this clipper for 45 - 50 bucks you&#x27;d be saving a minimum of 135 bucks/year... my clipper still works very good after almost 3 years (a lot of hair cuts)... saved about 400 bucks in hair cuts... battery life has dropped about half but i dont really need it.&lt;br /&gt;So go head and buy it!</li>
    <li> Had this no for about a year and a half. and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;Battery holds a charge for a pretty good length of time.</li>
    <li> Firt, I use this to cut my mother&#x27;s hair and it seem to do a good job.  Next, I try to do it myself in front of full length mirror at both side.  It was fine until I was trying to trim the top of my hair by feel without looking and suddenly a chunk of my hair got clipped off.  I gave 4 stars because this device really works but there&#x27;s a danger of over-cutting if you&#x27;re not careful.  I will use it again but will pay more attention when I place the clipper over my head.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my boyfriend and son to use. They both keep their hair short and our other clippers had died. I loved the thought that they would be able to do this themselves and I would be able to just clean up the back edge and sides for them. These clippers cut very, very poorly and unevenly. I would love to return these, but too much time has passed, so I will have to buy more. The quality of the cut goes down everytime we use them. I do make sure they are throughly cleaned and we have had to oil them.&lt;br /&gt;I would look for another set of clippers.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few different self-cut hair trimmers, and this is by far my favorite.  It cuts very uniformly and evenly.  There are 5 positions for the head (straight plus 45 and 90 degrees) on each side.  It is quick and easy to change the angle which makes it easier to get at all the hair on the back and sides of my head.  I love the depth setting.  I do most of my head at a setting of 3 and then just drop it to a 1 to do my neck and right around the ears.  If I want my hair a bit longer in the winter I will bump the setting up to 4 or 5.  It isn&#x27;t necessary for me to change combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially like the secure way the combs attach to the clipper.  They actually snap in around the head instead of just using metal or plastic clips.  Because they are adjustable I only need to leave the one comb attached full time.</li>
