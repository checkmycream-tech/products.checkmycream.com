      <li>wife&#x27;s favorite scent</li>
      <li>I expect the seller to cover their costs, including their time--but it doesnt take any more time to put 4 tubes in a box and ship it than it does to put one.</li>
      <li>This body cream is the smoothest, creamiest and most feminine smelling body cream in my \\&quot;collection\\&quot;.</li>

      <li>This scent is also available in body spray and other forms</li>
      <li>I am asked VERY frequently what perfume I am wearing</li>
      <li>applied the Fresh Musk Fantasy lotion FIRST and then an decent amount of Auric Blend&#x27;s Eqyptian Goddess Perfume OVER it!&lt;br /&gt;After a few minutes...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little hard to find online, so amazon is a great place to reorder when you run out.</li>
      <li>I receive compliments on this scent frequently.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t really what I expected.  </li>

<li> For some odd reason this scent is not readily available in some stores along with other Body Fantasies products.</li>
<li> So...I did a little experimenting.  </li>
<li> I bought this for a lady who was having trouble finding this in stores here.</li>
<li> I have already re- ordered a few tubes as back-up.</li>
<li> The lotion gave the Egyptian Goddess just a little kick and the combination of both products was unbelievable and lastover over 6 hours.  </li>
<li> The Body Shop&#x27;s White Musk and is signicantly less expensive.  </li>
<li> I can&#x27;t say that it is unpleasant, but it really is not as subtly fragrant as The Body Shops&#x27;s scent.</li>
<li> As you may or may know, may sellers as wel as big brands like Auric Blends, Body Time, Attar Bazaar....are &#x27;cutting&#x27; their finished products with canola oil to increase profit margins.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s frustrating to spend $30 or $40 on Egyptian Musk either you can&#x27;t smell or the scent disappears after a few mnutes.</li>
<li> and I was really disappointed.  </li>

    <li> This is a great lotion.  I learned of it from my daughter and have used it ever since.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t really what I expected.  I was looking for the nice smell.</li>
    <li> I JUST LOVE,LOVE,LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I&#x27;M A BIG FAN OF MUSK, ANYTHING WITH MUSK IN IT.  WHEN I SAW THIS LOTION, I KNEW I HAD TO HAVE IT. I RECCOMMEND ANYONE WHO LOVE MUSK BUY THIS PRODUCT. YOU WILL ENJOY IT. ALMOST AS MUCH AS I DO.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a deliciously scented hand creme, this is it!  I even find myself putting my hands to my nose throughout the day just to smell the scent.  It also is a very good softener for the hands.  It&#x27;s a little hard to find online, so amazon is a great place to reorder when you run out.</li>
    <li> This is the only place I can find this lotion. It is by far my favorite.  It&#x27;s a pleasant powdery, slighty musky scent.  I am asked VERY frequently what perfume I am wearing but I don&#x27;t wear any, only this lotion.  This scent is also available in body spray and other forms but I do NOT like them.  For some reason they are too strong when you first put them on, smell a little different and also don&#x27;t last more than an hour or so.  I order it from Parfums de Coeur on the Amazon site all the time and it&#x27;s quick and easy.  I always receive the product within a week!!</li>
    <li> This product is great.  I always get comments on how good I smell and they want the name of the product.  The store I was purchasing this from discontinued the cream and I was really disappointed.  Thank you Amazon for helping me obtain this product!</li>
    <li> This body cream is the smoothest, creamiest and most feminine smelling body cream in my \\&quot;collection\\&quot;. I am constantly getting compliments each and every time I wear it! It is light, floral and with a touch of musk. I use it with the body spray, too.</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve used The Body Shop&#x27;s White Musk products.  Now I&#x27;m on a tighter \\&quot;budget\\&quot; and decided to try this white musk variety.  It&#x27;s nice - I can&#x27;t say that it is unpleasant, but it really is not as subtly fragrant as The Body Shops&#x27;s scent.</li>
    <li> This is my &#x27;go-to&#x27; scent for summer, it&#x27;s light so it&#x27;s nice in the warm weather. It&#x27;s also inexpensive. I&#x27;ve been using this scent every summer for years now.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore the scent of this lotion.  I&#x27;ve had it before &amp; will never be without it.  Every time I wear it, even people across the room say &amp;#34;who smells so good?&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s light and fresh.  Love it!</li>
    <li> use this lotion for year&#x27;s  smell great make your skin soft it&#x27;s the best i order 6 at a time</li>
    <li> I love this lotion--I order it over and over.  I am definitely a committed customer, and I almost always order more than one tube at a time.  What I dont understand is why I am charged $5.00 shipping for EACH tube.  The Amazon shipping charges chart shows that an order is $4.49 plus $.50 per lb.  But I am being charged $4.49 plus $.50 per lb for EACH TUBE, even though they come in the same box.  I expect the seller to cover their costs, including their time--but it doesnt take any more time to put 4 tubes in a box and ship it than it does to put one.</li>
    <li> I am delighted to be able to purchase this product. For some odd reason this scent is not readily available in some stores along with other Body Fantasies products. I was so excited to find this I stocked up and bought 2.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a lady who was having trouble finding this in stores here. She was originally from New York. I think it smells GRRRREAT.</li>
    <li> I receive compliments on this scent frequently. Good lotion for the price. Will  buy again, does not irritate the skin.</li>
    <li> The scent is great, I just wish it lasted longer and I wish the lotion was creamier, it&#x27;s not really a moisturizing lotion.  When I use this I normally put an unscented moisturizing lotion on first, then this lotion.  Again, it smells good it just doesn&#x27;t seem to last long enough.  Price was good, shipping was fast, if the scent lasted longer I would bump it up to four STARS.</li>
    <li> In addition to being a great moisturizer, Fresh White has some unknown &#x27;perks.&#x27;  In addition to moisturizing the body, it smells line The Body Shop&#x27;s White Musk and is signicantly less expensive.  And an unkown benefit.  As you may or may know, may sellers as wel as big brands like Auric Blends, Body Time, Attar Bazaar....are &#x27;cutting&#x27; their finished products with canola oil to increase profit margins.  It&#x27;s frustrating to spend $30 or $40 on Egyptian Musk either you can&#x27;t smell or the scent disappears after a few mnutes. So...I did a little experimenting.  As I love all Egytptian Musk scents on the market but their short fragrance life is a bummer.&lt;br /&gt;I applied the Fresh Musk Fantasy lotion FIRST and then an decent amount of Auric Blend&#x27;s Eqyptian Goddess Perfume OVER it!&lt;br /&gt;After a few minutes...The E Goddess bloomed and there was a a change.  The lotion gave the Egyptian Goddess just a little kick and the combination of both products was unbelievable and lastover over 6 hours.  I tried this on several E Musks and they came to life.&lt;br /&gt;In essence, not only is the white musk/E Musk combo but it also smells great  on it&#x27;s also a great stand alone.  Try it some time. I have already re- ordered a few tubes as back-up.</li>
    <li> this lotion is amazing if you like to smell good all the time this is for you and the smell would stay for hours as well so if you put it on in the morning it will stay until you come from work or school it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> wife&#x27;s favorite scent</li>
