      <li>I love having something I can grab as I&#x27;m running out the door if I didn&#x27;t brush :)</li>
      <li>Tasted ok and I enjoyed it.</li>
      <li>It works, should have researched it more as it irritates my stomach</li>
      <li>The individually wrapped packages of two gum pieces are very handy!</li>
      <li>I love this gum it makes your mouth feel so cool and clean.</li>
      <li>And I enjoy the flavor.</li>
      <li>The gum is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>I was thinking this gum would fit in with my teeth cleaning routine</li>
      <li>The flavor of the gum is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>but I do enjoy</li>
      <li>But I love the way it feels in my mouth super fresh and clean but don&#x27;t expect any whitening from one jar.</li>
      <li>I find most gum pieces too large.</li>
      <li>It has no added sugar and a not too sweet minty taste.</li>
      <li>The fact that the gum actually works and doesn&#x27;t taste like roadkill is a good thing.  </li>
      <li>We have used the super smile products for a couple of years.</li>
      <li>but it is nice to have after a glass of red wine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fresh</li>
      <li>It has a nice taste and lasted as long as any gum lasts with me.  </li>
      <li>My teeth were dingy from coffee and this gum really shined them up quick.</li>
      <li>this really helps keep my smile whiter.  </li>
      <li>Large jar of gum.</li>
      <li>but it certainly makes teeth feel cleaner.</li>
      <li>The gum does not hold its&#x27; flavor very long,but I don&#x27;t care about that</li>
      <li>It is very nice-tasting and helps whiten teeth and freshen breath.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work, and they taste like chalk.</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;ve chewed many of the gum packets (2 pods to a packet)  and they have a refreshing minty flavor that lasts, at least to me, all of five minutes.</li>
      <li>Dentyn&#x27;s flavor lasts MUCH longer.</li>
      <li>After purchasing the Supersmile toothpaste set and Pre Rinse, I got this gum for when I go out to eat and won&#x27;t be coming straight home to brush my teeth.  </li>
      <li>i really like this gum.</li>
      <li>Should not waste the money.</li>
      <li>far as the taste - I don&#x27;t understand the complaints.  </li>
      <li>It has an intense minty flavor that immediately freshens breath, especially for those times when you can&#x27;t get to a toothbrush.</li>
      <li>far as quantity goes, I wasn&#x27;t shorted like some people were.  </li>
      <li>The taste is okay,  a little chalky but as long as it&#x27;s cleaning and whitening my teeth</li>
      <li>I keep a few in my car and purse as a quick touch up after coffee and wine.</li>
      <li>The only down side to the supersmile gum is the flavor fades quickly.  </li>
      <li>a LOT of the Zyletol gums either taste weird or the flavor doesn&#x27;t last, and this tastes great and long lasting flavor.</li>

<li> Didn&#x27;t see a major different in the whiteness of my teeth due to just chewing the gum, but I would buy the product again.  </li>
<li> Flavor doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
<li> This may help keep your already white teeth.......white, but it has absolutely no flavor.  </li>
<li> They only thing I would say is that it works along with Thx other supersmile products to get results not alone.</li>
<li> But when I initially counted I had a senior moment and thought I had been sent half.  </li>
<li> However, the gum was several months past the use by date.</li>
<li> i use the other supersmile products and I like those too.</li>
<li> but it, sadly, falls way short on the long lasting flavor.</li>
<li> This gum is similar to Trident White or Orbit White, but unlike those, it doesn&#x27;t have artificial sweeteners.  </li>
<li> Not worth it.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> Loses flavor quick (and it&#x27;s bad regardless).</li>
<li> The gum tastes like crap and that ruins the whole thing.</li>
<li> Duh.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s &amp;#34;whitening gum&amp;#34; or not, the flavor is not good, and the gum is hard to chew.</li>
<li> , I hate having to fumble around to get the gum out of the individual packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The taste quickly disappears and you are chewing a tasteless substance that tough &amp; boring!</li>
<li> I think this gum is very expensive for what it is</li>
<li> me sick</li>
<li> Terrible taste and terrible after taste with little to no visible benefit.</li>
<li> Taste is horrible and you sallow the juices............</li>

    <li> But I love the way it feels in my mouth super fresh and clean but don&#x27;t expect any whitening from one jar.</li>
    <li> This gum is similar to Trident White or Orbit White, but unlike those, it doesn&#x27;t have artificial sweeteners.  It is very nice-tasting and helps whiten teeth and freshen breath.  I chew after coffee or a meal if I can&#x27;t brush my teeth.  The individually wrapped packages of two gum pieces are very handy!</li>
    <li> Freshens breath but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> Large jar of gum. Like the taste.</li>
    <li> I believe it isn&#x27;t helping to whiten my teeth at all and will not re-order this product! The taste quickly disappears and you are chewing a tasteless substance that tough &amp; boring!</li>
    <li> We have used the super smile products for a couple of years. This gum is so handy to keep in your purse or pocket. Individual packs of two pieces. I would make no claims about making teeth whiter but it certainly makes teeth feel cleaner. Nice size to freshen up.</li>
    <li> After purchasing the Supersmile toothpaste set and Pre Rinse, I got this gum for when I go out to eat and won&#x27;t be coming straight home to brush my teeth.  Had to try it and found two pieces of gum in each separately wrapped package.  It has a nice taste and lasted as long as any gum lasts with me.  I will not dread chewing it after eating out.</li>
    <li> This gum is just gross. I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s &amp;#34;whitening gum&amp;#34; or not, the flavor is not good, and the gum is hard to chew. Loses flavor quick (and it&#x27;s bad regardless). Will not buy again. Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> It works, should have researched it more as it irritates my stomach</li>
    <li> This stuff tastes GREAT!  a LOT of the Zyletol gums either taste weird or the flavor doesn&#x27;t last, and this tastes great and long lasting flavor.</li>
    <li> So far, I&#x27;ve chewed many of the gum packets (2 pods to a packet)  and they have a refreshing minty flavor that lasts, at least to me, all of five minutes.

    <li> really yummy and the benefit is great!</li>
    <li> This gum doesn&#x27;t necessarily whiten miracuously but it is nice to have after a glass of red wine. I keep a few in my car and purse as a quick touch up after coffee and wine. It has no added sugar and a not too sweet minty taste. Flavor doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a simple way to whiten your teeth some, this product definitely works.  Best of all it&#x27;s convenient and you can do it anywhere without anyone knowing you aren&#x27;t just chewing a regular piece of gum.  The product actually works.  You&#x27;re not going to be visible from space but your teeth will definitely be several shades whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the taste - I don&#x27;t understand the complaints.  The gum serves a purpose.  That purpose is to whiten your teeth.  Not freshen your breath.  Nobody complains about the taste of aspirin when they have a headache.  The fact that the gum actually works and doesn&#x27;t taste like roadkill is a good thing.  What did regular gum ever do for you?  Get over it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as quantity goes, I wasn&#x27;t shorted like some people were.  But when I initially counted I had a senior moment and thought I had been sent half.  Duh.  It&#x27;s 2 pieces per package, 50 packages per container.  2 x 50 &#x3D; 100.</li>
    <li> I use this gum and the whitening toothpaste pack too.My teeth were dingy from coffee and this gum really shined them up quick.Definitely a must have for me.The gum does not hold its&#x27; flavor very long,but I don&#x27;t care about that because I know that it is shining my teeth up,which is great.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this gum for a while now and loves the taste and the whitening it helps with.</li>
    <li> i really like this gum. I find most gum pieces too large. These pieces are the perfect size and they whiten your teeth and freshen your breath. i use the other supersmile products and I like those too. I get good comments on my teeth. Recently I had to have caps and my teeth were even whiter than the whitest standard cap.</li>
    <li> I have been using Supersmile Whitening Gum for several years. It has an intense minty flavor that immediately freshens breath, especially for those times when you can&#x27;t get to a toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I love this gum it makes your mouth feel so cool and clean.</li>
    <li> This may help keep your already white teeth.......white, but it has absolutely no flavor.  Not my favorite whitening gum.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see a major different in the whiteness of my teeth due to just chewing the gum, but I would buy the product again.  I think combined with the toothpaste and mouthwash, it is a good product.</li>
    <li> Information stated packaging may be damaged. Packaging was not damaged. However, the gum was several months past the use by date.</li>
    <li> I think this gum is very expensive for what it is and if I could, I would return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flavor literally fades immediately and the packaging seems so wasteful, I hate having to fumble around to get the gum out of the individual packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this gum... but their toothpaste is great.</li>
    <li> I love this gum!  It works great to whiten teeth.  I drink coffee and tea this really helps keep my smile whiter.  And I enjoy the flavor. A+++</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fresh but I don&#x27;t see the difference in whitening.</li>
    <li> MADE IN CHINA-READ THE FINE PRINT!</li>
    <li> The gum is fantastic.  It comes in individually wrapped packages.  There are 2 pieces of gum in each wrapper.  The flavor of the gum is fantastic.  The only down side to the supersmile gum is the flavor fades quickly.  It only lasts for about 10 minutes, after which it starts to become more difficult to chew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IDK if it actually made my teeth any whiter...but I do enjoy the gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will order the gum again.</li>
    <li> Tasted ok and I enjoyed it. They only thing I would say is that it works along with Thx other supersmile products to get results not alone. So get the supersmile line with the gum .to get the results. Or else get $2 colgate and trident gum.</li>
    <li> The gum tastes like crap and that ruins the whole thing. Not worth it. Should not waste the money. HOpe this helped</li>
    <li> The taste is okay,  a little chalky but as long as it&#x27;s cleaning and whitening my teeth I&#x27;m happy with it. I love having something I can grab as I&#x27;m running out the door if I didn&#x27;t brush :)</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work, and they taste like chalk.</li>
    <li> Great gum, for whitening teeth as well as giving the Xylitol protection.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Followed directions and it did nothing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really good gum for teens</li>
    <li> YUCK! don&#x27;t waste your money. Taste is horrible and you sallow the juices............which is toothpasthe (you spit that out!)&lt;br /&gt;Made me sick</li>
    <li> Terrible taste and terrible after taste with little to no visible benefit. Seemed like a good idea but did not work well for me.</li>
