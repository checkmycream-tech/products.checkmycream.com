      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Also it did feel refreshing to use.</li>
      <li>I figured it would be better than using soap and wanted to give it a try.</li>
      <li>You are more than I ever could have hoped for.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m more confident than ever</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;d have to say it&#x27;s more of a neutral scent.</li>
      <li>I love the smell</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing more.</li>
      <li>This magical formula appears.</li>
      <li>fresh;this is a very amazing wash that&lt;br /&gt;women need to know about that keeps them feeling clean and fresh;</li>
      <li>It was a pretty good deal for the quantity and price.</li>
      <li>This product has consistently provided me with good results.  </li>
      <li>This product is probably fine for most people, but if you have SLS sensitivity you should avoid it.</li>
      <li>Over all a much better experience, and better feeling of clean than using soap.</li>
      <li>but I feel it&#x27;s too strong for me.</li>
      <li>Also, and this is just based on my own experience; when it&#x27;s that time of the month, a diet rich in fruits ( the fresh pineapple thing  </li>
      <li>and I have found that Amazon has the best price hands down.  </li>
      <li>Like any new product you use it&#x27;s best to test it on certain parts of the body first to see if you have a reaction to it.</li>
      <li>This was a HUGE mistake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>light scent&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve began to use this as a all over body wash in the mornings because I like the light, lavender like scent.</li>
      <li>Gentle and effective.</li>
      <li>The smell is light and feminine and the consistency is quality.  </li>
      <li>Its a great product to get rid of feminine odor especially when you are that time of the month.</li>
      <li>I have to say I&#x27;m pretty pleased with this wash.</li>
      <li>you smelling clean .</li>
      <li>help to keep my feminine areas moist and clean.</li>
      <li>I was apprehensive while ordering this but after seeing so many positive reviews, decided to give this a try.</li>
      <li>Not only does it have a good scent,  </li>
      <li>What a delightful change!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some negative reviews about the change in scent..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to feel fresh all day long!</li>
      <li>Ladies, I was fresh and clean for about a week.  </li>
      <li>but it keeps you fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>it leaves you feeling fresh and clean all day.</li>
      <li>I think the mild change in scent may be from shower water getting in the bottle.  </li>
      <li>Prior to this - and the lovely allergic reaction issue - I had never had a sense of being unclean, but I liked being able to use something that wouldn&#x27;t irritate like soap and would help with any future issues with laundry detergents.</li>
      <li>I feel fresh throughout the night after I shower with this.</li>
      <li>With Vagisil I feel fresh and it does its job</li>
      <li>Second, and possibly most likely, is that unless your doctor has specifically diagnosed you with pH issues this product will not be good for you.</li>
      <li>It is a clear formula and seems to have more potency than Summers Eve.</li>
      <li>I saw this on the shelves and decided it was worth giving it a try.</li>
      <li>The label says fresh scent</li>
      <li>Leaves you smelling and feeling like a fresh spring</li>
      <li>feeling fresh and clean,no matter how hot or how&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been a long time user of Summers Eve and after years of using it I have found that it became quite watery and not as effective as it used to be.</li>
      <li>Been using this product for years because it&#x27;s very gentle as a feminine wash.  </li>
      <li>this is the first time i&#x27;m ever writing a review for a product, but once i used this i had to.</li>
      <li>I was using a different brand -more</li>
      <li>I noticed the difference after the first time of using it.  </li>
      <li>First day I started using this</li>
      <li>really does work!)</li>
      <li>However not so great with delicate areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I definitely wasn&#x27;t pleased with myself.</li>
      <li>This product is gentle enough to wash between the vaginal lips leaving you smelling fresh and tasting clean.</li>
      <li>I also have to wonder if this product is more temperamental when it comes to shipping and storage - quicker to turn bad - and thus might be a product you should purchase at a brick-and-mortar point of sale where you can inspect before purchase or have a greater surety that the product was properly stored, transported, and protected for temperature extremes.cond, and possibly most likely, is that unless your doctor has specifically diagnosed you with pH issues this product will not be good for you.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this for a family member and when I ran out of Summers Eve, I decided to use this. It works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Non irritating and smells good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product the longest. It&#x27;s keeps you smelling clean . But also remember to use a daily panty liner to keep the stank away</li>
    <li> I like this product and have used this brand for a few years.</li>
    <li> Over all a much better experience, and better feeling of clean than using soap. Glad this is on the market.</li>
    <li> this is the first time i&#x27;m ever writing a review for a product, but once i used this i had to. when i first ordered this i was very skeptical that it would actually block odor, but it really does!! it leaves you feeling fresh and clean all day. i no longer have to be worried or self conscious about odor. great deal for such an awesome product! definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I had previously used the &amp;#34;Odor Block&amp;#34; version of this product after my doctor recommended it to help me recover from a bad allergic reaction to laundry detergent. I like that product and when I attempted to re-order I was prompted to purchase this version touted as &amp;#34;New and Improved.&amp;#34; I figured I would like it as well and pH balance can&#x27;t be a bad thing right. Prior to this - and the lovely allergic reaction issue - I had never had a sense of being unclean, but I liked being able to use something that wouldn&#x27;t irritate like soap and would help with any future issues with laundry detergents. This was a HUGE mistake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived and was sealed - the bottles were in a ziptop bag, but the bottles were factory sealed - but upon opening the bottle I sensed that something was different. The previous formula/version I had used had a light, clean scent, this had an off putting scent that I could only describe as somewhat sour. The consistency was weird too - though clear gel, it seemed almost lumpy and grainy. Using it in the shower was the same as before - slight lather, no adverse reactions, and rinsed completely away. I felt normal after the shower - again, I&#x27;ve never had an issue with feeling unclean or such - but that only lasts for a couple of hours. For the first time ever in my life I feel unclean when using, and that sour smell from the product appears to create an interaction with my chemistry to add an odor and wetness to the mix of first time ever.  Will never use this again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two guesses as to what might be at issue here. First, the product, as received, was spoiled (i.e. exposed to extreme heat or cold) thus creating the sour-ish smell of the product and leading to all the other issues. But as I never purchased this formula before, I cannot attest to the batch I received being different other than the smell and consistency was slightly different that another formula, which can be the case with any product. Second, and possibly most likely, is that unless your doctor has specifically diagnosed you with pH issues this product will not be good for you. If your body already balances its own pH levels naturally, adding a product that claims to balance can throw off your natural chemistry I must assume, therefore you will experience the unpleasant issues that those who legitimately suffer from such an issue.  I also have to wonder if this product is more temperamental when it comes to shipping and storage - quicker to turn bad - and thus might be a product you should purchase at a brick-and-mortar point of sale where you can inspect before purchase or have a greater surety that the product was properly stored, transported, and protected for temperature extremes.cond, and possibly most likely, is that unless your doctor has specifically diagnosed you with pH issues this product will not be good for you.

    <li> Excellent Feminine Wash, I have Sjogrens Syndrome Disorder and this product help to keep my feminine areas moist and clean.</li>
    <li> This body wash is just terrific.  I get a yeasty heat rash during the humid Southern summers.  I use the wash with a natural sponge and the combination seems to enhance the cleansing effect.  I leave it on while I wash my hair to prolong any medicinal effect.</li>
    <li> I bought two bottles of this feminine wash and have been using it for about tow months.. I love it!  I used to have odor sometimes during my cycle, especially after intercourse, also repeated mild yeast infection. My husband mentioned the odor once.  Out of embarrassment, I decided to buy this feminine wash and see what wonder it can do.. I noticed the difference after the first time of using it.  The odor and itch were gone the next day, and they haven&#x27;t returned yet!! What a delightful change!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some negative reviews about the change in scent.. so I paid attention and smelled it in shower every time before I use it, to make sure it didn&#x27;t turn sour.  So far so good, even though I did notice a little change in scent, it&#x27;s not so bad that I would think it&#x27;s gone bad...I&#x27;m still using it everyday, and everything is fine.  I think the mild change in scent may be from shower water getting in the bottle.  So I always try not to get any water in the bottle to keep it as fresh as possible. Anyway, I think it&#x27;s a great product for women who suffer from odor and yeast infection.</li>
    <li> A MUST BUY!!!&lt;br /&gt;KEEPS YOU DRY, FRESH AND CLEAN ALL DAY...&lt;br /&gt;WORKS \\&quot;VERY\\&quot; WELL WITH USE OF THE POWDER!!!&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT PURCHASE, UNLESS YOU PLAN TO USE THE POWDER.&lt;br /&gt;BETTER RESULTS!!!</li>
    <li> typically I buy the summers eve bottle, but I found this one on amazon, and it was cheaper (at the time.. I haven&#x27;t checked recently) then the summers eve, and it does the same thing. it comes in a two pack which is awesome for me. definitely will repurchase.</li>
    <li> Its a great product to get rid of feminine odor especially when you are that time of the month. It&#x27;s Great!</li>
    <li> I was apprehensive while ordering this but after seeing so many positive reviews, decided to give this a try. I must say the pack of 2 is well worth the money spent as it works as described.</li>
    <li> Before I used this product I always had problem with yeast.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it almost 15 years, and in all this years, I had yeast infection only once or twice. Never ever would I use any other product!</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the ph balance in it. I figured it would be better than using soap and wanted to give it a try.</li>
    <li> MY GOD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start off by saying I have a very strong sense of smell. Someone can be cutting cucumbers in the kitchen and I can smell it from the floor above. I can use an outhouse, and smell the characteristic odor lingering on my clothes for hours afterwards. Suffice it to say, my nose is in prime working order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which unfortunately means that, as weird as this may sound, I can...erm...smell &amp;#34;myself&amp;#34; on my hands, say after showing or whatnot. And I can smell that for DAYS. I&#x27;ve tried washing my hands crazy amounts of times with different kinds of soap, but nothing has seemed to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, like a knight in shining armor, *poof*! This magical formula appears. And I can&#x27;t believe it. One tiny little squirt and instantly (and I mean INSTANTLY) neutralizes the odor. It is almost unbelievable how well it balances out the odor. I had to try it several times to see if the first time was a fluke, but it&#x27;s not. This stuff is absolutely amazing. Leaves you smelling and feeling like a fresh spring flower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t find this years earlier. Hats off to you, Vagisil. You are more than I ever could have hoped for.</li>
    <li> It smells very nice but isn&#x27;t too strong. I feel fresh throughout the night after I shower with this. I will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but had to for this product...i just turned 24 years old and I used summers eve and it doesn&#x27;t do anything. First day I started using this I felt a difference. I&#x27;m very sensitive, anything makes me discharge fast or get a slight infection and using this I haven&#x27;t had any problems or haven&#x27;t discharged at all like I used to. Will continue to use this . really recommend it and will never go back to summers eve</li>
    <li> This product has really been a lifesaver.  The smell is light and feminine and the consistency is quality.  I have a very hard time finding this product in stores for a decent price and I have found that Amazon has the best price hands down.  I have recommended this product to friends and family as the probiotic in the ingredients are very helpful when experiencing any symptoms related to BV.</li>
    <li> I bought this. It came on the exact date expected. It was a pretty good deal for the quantity and price. The label says fresh scent but I&#x27;d have to say it&#x27;s more of a neutral scent. But that&#x27;s better than smelly lol. Also it did feel refreshing to use. I&#x27;d recommend it to any ladies who feel like they need to take 3 showers a day because they think it&#x27;s their soap that&#x27;s the problem. I love it.</li>
    <li> I like it, does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> This is a recurring purchase. Recommend product and reseller without reservations.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years because it&#x27;s very gentle as a feminine wash.  It provides a sense of freshness and leaves you feeling clean all the way!!!!</li>
    <li> I have must have been in loved with Vagisil products forever!&lt;br /&gt;They just keep getting better.  It&#x27;s great to feel fresh all day long!</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive down below. The wrong detergent used to wash panties effects my pH balance down there. I saw this on the shelves and decided it was worth giving it a try. I use a tiny dab with my hands all over on my sensitive areas, and rinse well. I believe this stuff cleans very well but gently, and has not at all disturbed my pH. I would recommend for other sensitive ladies! I have been using the same bottle every single day for the past 7 months, and I still have about 2 week&#x27;s worth of product in the bottle. I am definitely repurchasing this.</li>
    <li> I do tend to have some issues with my PH, so i bought this in conjunction with the pill Rephresh. This feminine wash works great and does leave a clean and refreshing feeling after the shower. My tip is to \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; a little longer than usual just to make sure you&#x27;re getting it totally clean. I suggest buying Rephresh is you find this doesn&#x27;t help with odor or discharge.To be discreet i actually poured it into an old body wash bottle, just in case i have guests over, just make sure you set it to the side so it doesn&#x27;t get confused with normal body wash.

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for at least a year now and it really works. Also use the powder to keep the freshness throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Gentle and effective. It kills me to hear a girl say they use a body soap like Dove for their lady bits. I give them some of this in a travel bottle and they always buy it themselves after trying it. I like how this one specifically is aimed at -biotics and is ph balanced.</li>
    <li> I never knew that stress could effect the way you smell down there! I guess so because for the past year I&#x27;ve noticed a weird  after scent when I just do number 1. I&#x27;m a hygiene freak so I definitely wasn&#x27;t pleased with myself. I wasn&#x27;t convinced that it was something serious enough to see the gyno for, so I decided to try this first. I have to say I&#x27;m pretty pleased with this wash. It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do as a daily feminine wash. I noticed a difference after the first use and 2 weeks later, using it once a day, I haven&#x27;t had anymore bad odors from that region. However, it&#x27;s not a miracle worker...when it&#x27;s that time of the month your purse is going to do it&#x27;s own thing no matter what kind of wash or doosh you try. This still helps with keeping the scent in line so you feel confident through out the day though. I&#x27;ve began to use this as a all over body wash in the mornings because I like the light, lavender like scent. I do have somewhat sensitive skin but I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation. Like any new product you use it&#x27;s best to test it on certain parts of the body first to see if you have a reaction to it. Also, and this is just based on my own experience; when it&#x27;s that time of the month, a diet rich in fruits ( the fresh pineapple thing  really does work!) and veggies will make a big difference in your overall scent and feeling in general. Try not to eat too much distinctive odor type foods like garlic, onions, fish, ect.  Hope this helps someone.</li>
    <li> This product is terrific--My requirements were to maintain a normal pH balance.  This product just as good as the product I used to use which was $26 for 8 ounces...I am so glad to have found this--it is great.  Excellent Merchant--Good price, quick delivery and excellent product!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Vagisil may be a great product for others, however for me it was a nightmare.  Ladies, I was fresh and clean for about a week.  After that, the product went sour.  I had to stop using it. and begin a regimen of purification.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have delicate/sensitive lady parts, perhaps this product is not for you.  It&#x27;s a great body wash,.  However not so great with delicate areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies take heed!</li>
    <li> I have been a long time user of Summers Eve and after years of using it I have found that it became quite watery and not as effective as it used to be. After talking to a friend I decided to switch to Vagisil. It is a clear formula and seems to have more potency than Summers Eve. I will continue to recommend and purchase this product for effectiveness.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as previously purchased at local stores. A great price for a useful item-will purchase again if it remains at this price point bought with subscription so price was even better</li>
    <li> This product has consistently provided me with good results.  I have used this product for quite awhile and I have&lt;br /&gt;not been disappointed.  Above average in its results.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to use regular body wash to wash my bits so I looked around for a &amp;#34;healthier&amp;#34; alternative. Works great!! I&#x27;m more confident than ever and I feel great whenever I use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Very light scent&lt;br /&gt;lacto-probiotic IN the wash--great for our girlie parts!!&lt;br /&gt;Not a harsh cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Washes away easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Aren&#x27;t any it works wonderfully!!</li>
    <li> This is a good product. I love the smell but  I would not purchase again because I am too sensitive for it. But I recommend it for anyone who is not like me.</li>
    <li> The reason why I got this was because I was having some problems with dry skin &#x27;&#x27;down there&#x27;&#x27;, and was having more skin sluff off than I was supposed to. Even after I had visited my gynocologist, she just waved it off and told me that it was normal. But since I needed relief I did a little bit of my own research I figured that my pH must have been contributing problem with it.&lt;br /&gt;I use just a tiny amount and the dry patches are starting to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;Along with that I must also say that the after my period for the last few months I would get a yeast infection. But it has been about a week since my last one and since using this, there haven&#x27;t been any signs of it reoccuring!&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells great too! It reminds me of the smell of rose water.</li>
    <li> Works great! Love it. Even though this is external only it works better than douching which apparently is terrible for you. Great find lol I&#x27;ll never be with out this stuff.</li>
    <li> im not sure if i am alergic to this product, it seems to irritate me but i am sure it is a good product.</li>
    <li> I would not trust the hygiene of my lady area to any other product. This product is gentle enough to wash between the vaginal lips leaving you smelling fresh and tasting clean. Just don&#x27;t forget to rinse.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s so many good things to say about this but I will keep it short. Not only does it have a good scent,  but it keeps you fresh and clean. I was using a different brand -more expensive - but it seemed to not work so well.  This one however works great.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my sensitive feminine area. This smells good and I know it&#x27;s pH balance won&#x27;t cause any infection because it actually contains a probiotic!</li>
    <li> the vagisil feminine wash leaves you  feeling fresh and clean,no matter how hot or how&lt;br /&gt;much humidity is in the air it keeps you feeling fresh;this is a very amazing wash that&lt;br /&gt;women need to know about that keeps them feeling clean and fresh;</li>
    <li> I  cant stress enough how this stuff works. Suffered for years trying to find something to block odor and that doesn&#x27;t irritate me. This does both. Haven&#x27;t had a problem since I bought it. Definitely my go to from now on.</li>
    <li> No other product leaves me with the feeling that I really cleaned down there. I have tried Summer&#x27;s Eve before but I feel it&#x27;s too strong for me. With Vagisil I feel fresh and it does its job well. NO funny feelings, no odors, nothing. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Just what the doctor ordered.</li>
    <li> Use this product all the time! It&#x27;s great! My daughter is 11 and she started using it (I didn&#x27;t know) and she started itching. I told her not to use it. She doesn&#x27;t have any PH Balance issues yet! :)</li>
    <li> This product is very good to use I strongly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product has SLS in it, and it wasn&#x27;t obvious until somebody told me, because I could not find it on the manufacturer&#x27;s website. This product is probably fine for most people, but if you have SLS sensitivity you should avoid it.</li>
