      <li>This is a great top coat, protects the polish, wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
      <li>It is a good primer before you polish your nails and a good top coat.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This has not been as effective as the Manicure Gel Coat, and in would not use it regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am a fashion blogger and stylist and I am always looking for cute stuff/ good stuff.  </li>

      <li>helps keep my cuticles in check and my nails strong.</li>
      <li>Their gel formula is number one on my list of gel polishes that don&#x27;t require a uv light.</li>
      <li>My first purchase was a much better deal for all 3 products.</li>
      <li>I BELIEVE THE PROTEIN RICH COATINGS ARE THE ONES THAT ALLOWS MY NAILS TO GROW WITHOUT  BREAKING..</li>
      <li>Wanted to love it, but it&#x27;s just something I really like.</li>
      <li>ALL I HAVE TO DO IS BY USING MY OWN NAILS TO LIFT THE OLD ONE OFF.</li>
      <li>I really tried to like this product as i heard good reviews from a youtube guru i frequently watch but this item was not at all working for me.</li>
      <li>and it is super shiny.  </li>
      <li>Now my nails feel super health.  </li>
      <li>Well worth it.</li>
      <li>I got lots of bubble and chipped manicure the first day.</li>
      <li>Next, I apply two coats of my favorite nail polish, and then apply The Gel,Coat over the nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>It also did not dry quick enough for me- over</li>
      <li>/&gt;Manicure Booster creates a coating over natural nails that nail polish can  adhere to.</li>
      <li>Really like this product, wish I could find it locally!</li>
      <li>Lot stronger, easy to apply quick dry and get that professional glossy look in no time and the polish stays on for at least 2 weeks</li>
      <li>It is not as shiny a finish as I normally like, and it does not help my manicure to last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, NAIL PRODUCTS LIFE CYCLE IS BARELY</li>
      <li>JUST SIMPLY RE-APPLY AFTER REMOVING THE OLD ONES.</li>
      <li>I USE  &amp;#34;PINK GEL COAT,&amp;#34;  &amp;#34; PINK  &amp; CLEAR GEL COAT &amp;#34;  AND &amp;#34; GEL COAT COLOR &amp;#34;.</li>

    <li> Really like this product, wish I could find it locally! I have very thin nails that usually chip, rip and tear. This product makes my nails strong and they actually grow! I used to paint my nails all the time because they were stained and wouldn&#x27;t grow without coats of polish. I started using this product, applying two coats and no longer have to paint them with color. No more stain and they are stronger than ever!</li>
    <li> Love this makes manicure last longer than any other product I have tried.</li>
    <li> Love this formula. I am on my second bottle. I apply this by itself in one coat.&lt;br /&gt;It helps keep my cuticles in check and my nails strong.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Quite delivery!</li>
    <li> This is a great top coat, protects the polish, wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> I appreciate the quality but question the value in comparison to similar products that are less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;  My first purchase was a much better deal for all 3 products.</li>
    <li> My manicure last at least 7-days and it is super shiny.  Plus, I used to suffer from dry nails and the ingredients in this stuff helped cure that.  Now my nails feel super health.  Well worth it.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USIN THESE &amp;#34;GOOD STUFF &amp;#34; ITEMS &amp;#34; PERFECT FORMULA &amp;#34; PRODUCTS NOW OVER TWO MONTHS. I USE  &amp;#34;PINK GEL COAT,&amp;#34;  &amp;#34; PINK  &amp; CLEAR GEL COAT &amp;#34;  AND &amp;#34; GEL COAT COLOR &amp;#34;. I BELIEVE THE PROTEIN RICH COATINGS ARE THE ONES THAT ALLOWS MY NAILS TO GROW WITHOUT  BREAKING.. MY NAILS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY DRY. SHORT  NOTE, NAIL PRODUCTS LIFE CYCLE IS BARELY A WEEK, BEFORE THEY START FLAKING OFF. JUST SIMPLY RE-APPLY AFTER REMOVING THE OLD ONES. ACTUALLY, I AM GETTING A KICK OUT OF THE FACT THAT  ALL I HAVE TO DO IS BY USING MY OWN NAILS TO LIFT THE OLD ONE OFF. NO CHEMICALS USED THAT WAY. MORE HEALTHY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; IN ADDITION I HAVE BEEN USING NAIL HARDENER FROM SWITZERLAND CALLED &amp;#34; MAVALA NAIL HARDENER &amp;#34;. BUT NOTE, ONLY ON THE TIPS.  IT CAN BE BOUGHT IN THIS COUNTRY TOO. JUST LOOK UNDER &amp;#34; MAVALA &amp;#34;. IT IS RATHER COSTLY, BUT &amp;#34; GOOD STUFF. &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I am a fashion blogger and stylist and I am always looking for cute stuff/ good stuff.  I love this product and I love the price and fast service!!! I am very happy and recommend it  to everybody</li>
    <li> Does what it says it will do, makes manicures last. Put it on by itself or as a base coat, then apply it over your color. Gives you a beautiful faux gel finish. I&#x27;m in love with this stuff.</li>
    <li> I really tried to like this product as i heard good reviews from a youtube guru i frequently watch but this item was not at all working for me. I got lots of bubble and chipped manicure the first day. I tried thin coats and the same thing happened.</li>
    <li> Helps my manicures last 2-3 times longer</li>
    <li> I received this formula manicure booster as a gift, and when I went to purchase it, I was surprised at the price, this is a very small bottle, 0.6 oz. I waited for a set on QVC and found one that included this manicure booster.  Manicure Booster is OK, but not a necessity. It is a good primer before you polish your nails and a good top coat. It is not as shiny a finish as I normally like, and it does not help my manicure to last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manicure Booster creates a coating over natural nails that nail polish can  adhere to. It acts as a primer and sealer to help prevent wear and chipping of my nail polish. I apply one coat of Perfect Formula Gel Coat to my nails. Next, I apply two coats of my favorite nail polish, and then apply The Gel,Coat over the nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has not been as effective as the Manicure Gel Coat, and in would not use it regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 09-14-14</li>
    <li> The perfect formula line is awesome. Their gel formula is number one on my list of gel polishes that don&#x27;t require a uv light. Really stays on well. Working in a hospital I wash my hands constantly. Just add an extra coat everyday.</li>
    <li> Great product! Prolonged the wear of my nail polish. Love the perfect formula nail care line. My purchase arrived promptly and in a cute little package.</li>
    <li> I wanted to LOVE this product. I do my nails about twice a week or more, depending on my mood, and love a good primer and top coat, and this is marketed as both. It did HORRIBLE things to two of my nail polishes. Bubbles everywhere the first time I used it. I figured I probably didn&#x27;t let this set long enough on my nails, but on my next use, I had the same problem. It also did not dry quick enough for me- over an hour later, I moved slightly and bumped my finger against my bed sheet and got instant wrinkling in the polish. Not cool. I also experienced chipping after my first day of wear both times I used this. I will use this on occasion to see if maybe the past experiences were flukes, which they very well could be. I will definitely keep you all updated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If something changes, I will update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(also seen on my blog - [...]</li>
    <li> Great for base and tops coats even when using your own nail polish.  My nails seem stronger and are growing longer.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but it delivers as promised.  It makes my nails. Lot stronger, easy to apply quick dry and get that professional glossy look in no time and the polish stays on for at least 2 weeks</li>
    <li> This is one of those great products you keep buying. I&#x27;m now on my third bottle! Use this product to prolong your shiny manicure and bring your nails back to life!</li>
    <li> Wanted to love it, but it&#x27;s just something I really like. I have nails that shred in layers and this didn&#x27;t help seal the tips enough, even with multiple coats going over the tips and around to the backs. Otherwise, the polish underneath didn&#x27;t chip from the cuticle or the tip, just wore down over time.</li>
    <li> The perfect formula is truly PERFECT.  It definitely keep the nail polish from chipping and nails stays shinning.  Love the product.</li>
    <li> This product does what it is touted to do- perform.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended to a friend who had thanked me several times..&lt;br /&gt;Have tried other items from this manufacturer and have been pleased also.</li>
