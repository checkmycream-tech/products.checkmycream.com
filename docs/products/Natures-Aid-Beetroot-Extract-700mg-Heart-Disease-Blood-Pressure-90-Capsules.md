<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> No better or worse than many other like products that I have tried.</li>
    <li> Beet root extract works great for my sis just diagnosed with ms.  But it literally  took just under 4 weeks to arrive to Southern California. Been looking for an alternative place since.</li>
    <li> This product has helped me a little, and may be more effective on others, because I may have another problem that need to be looked at.</li>
    <li> Seems pretty good, I have seen this much darker red so I don&#x27;t know how concentrated this is but it seems good.</li>
    <li> I had high blood pressure that turned out to be a result of the stress and pressure of impending thyroid cancer surgery.  I tried this product because I did not want to be on high blood pressure medication.  Unfortunately it did not work so I ended up having to temporarily go on medication anyway.  It could be that the reason it did not work is because my high blood pressure was induced by stress but regardless, I cannot rate this product any higher than 1 star because it really did not do anything at all.</li>
    <li> This product arrived quickly and as advertised I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> little sticky in the throat, seems to mildly help BP.  No other adverse side effects noted. would buy again, shipping was a little slow but it was coming from the UK to the US.</li>
    <li> This is the best beetroot juice capsule I have found. It comes from the UK but the shipping is surprisingly fast.  It is a once a day dosage, unlike the other brands that are twice daily, so you don&#x27;t have to purchase as often.</li>
    <li> Tried it to see if it would help my blood pressure. Didn&#x27;t make any  difference at all.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the product. It lowered my borderline hypertension and I have avoided taking blood pressure medicine with the help of this product. I personally recommend it to anyone who is looking to lower your blood pressure holistically.</li>
    <li> You will not find a better or stronger Beetroot Extract than this, so give it a try for yourself, it is the best I&#x27;ve found anywhere on Amazon and the Internet.</li>
    <li> I have low blood count and i usually use alot of iron pills. while doing some research online I found this Beetroot pill and I have heard beetroot is good for circulation and red blood cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first day of using this i must say I felt great. I wasn&#x27;t that cold anymore and I no longer use the iron I am a BELIEVER and this is one great of the great. I would deff be buying more and I also would be informing friends and family of this. GREAT Pill to have handy.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product and does what it says.  It does reduce my blood pressure and I&#x27;ve been feeling so much better since taking this supplement.</li>
    <li> I have only taken the product one day and have already noticed a drop in BP.  The HealthLand company is outstanding!</li>
    <li> works like a damned charm. as a musician-- a metal musicia-- it&#x27;s important to be able to rely on air getting through my body so i don&#x27;t burn out. this stuff works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any change in blood pressure after taking this over a month now. ...</li>
    <li> Great product for pre-workout!!</li>
    <li> I really like these, but you should know they come from overseas.  Not sure exactly where.  Sometimes the bottle is a little bit bent when it arrives. Anyway, they seem perfect and I&#x27;ll keep buying</li>
    <li> I have lived with plantar fascia pain in my foot for fifteen years, I had two cortisone injections in my foot. The first injection worked for a few years but the second one didn&#x27;t work at all. The pain would go up into my shin. I tried custom made orthotics which worked for a while, I also bought a contraption that was supposed to stretch the fascia while I slept (worthless). The podiatrist gave me the next option of removing the bone spur that had developed on my heel because of the constant pull from the fascia. I work in rehab and know that removing the spur won&#x27;t correct the problem of an inflamed fascia. It would also mean no weight bearing on that foot for weeks, and pain from the surgery itself. So a friend suggested beetroot. I take two tablets a day and I have had the most pain free year of my life. I no longer worry about whether my shoes have orthotics in them, and I can walk all day at work, and walk for pleasure without flareups. Beetroot is a natural anti inflammatory which is what you want. You need to reduce the inflammation.</li>
    <li> My husband has had his commercial driving license for years. THIS year, at his transportation physical, we were saddened to learn that he was having a slightly elevated blood pressure. Even slightly elevated causes an issue with your license. I had heard about Beetroot Extract and much prefer NATURAL supplements to the ever growing popularity of the pharmaceutical options. He started to take these 1 in the morning and 1 at night. In less than two weeks, he was back at the doctor&#x27;s office getting a complete release from the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; report! We&#x27;re keeping this in our daily routine!!!</li>
    <li> I am 70 years old. I check my blood pressure every day. This morning was 111/60. This product is doing what is supposed to do. A pleasantly rare thing in today&#x27;s world.  I received my order of Natures Aid Beetroot today 7-16-15. It wasn&#x27;t supposed to arrive until 7-29-15 or 8-11-15. One just cannot beat the good service from Hawthorn via Amazon.</li>
    <li> 10 pt drop in BP, well worth it</li>
