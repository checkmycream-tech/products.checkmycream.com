      <li>and I am excited to try more of their products.</li>
      <li>Their lipstick/glaze is also fantastic.  </li>
      <li>After touching up, the foundation lasted me a good ten hours.</li>
      <li>I have returned to my original powder foundation.  </li>
      <li>this is what i use when i want a heavier coverage for special occasions or performances.  </li>
      <li>I have fair skin with yellow undertones</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with this product. :)</li>
      <li>Applies really well, super silky!</li>
      <li>Even with the 100 percent pure primer underneath, this foundation did not go on smoothly on my pores.</li>
      <li>I love that this product is natural and vegan, but I&#x27;m thinking about purchasing a more moisturizing natural foundation</li>
      <li>Still worth the purchase for me.</li>
      <li>This product is super matte when you first apply it to your skin, I have oily skin</li>
      <li>It applies best with a brush and if you use just a little more than you&#x27;re used to so it doesn&#x27;t dry as fast.</li>
      <li>This foundation is medium coverage, and if you want to build it up, I strongly recommend that you don&#x27;t wait between layers because this foundation will dry and if you apply another layer on top it will cake up.</li>
      <li>I add face moisturizer right before application.</li>
      <li>100% Pure doesn&#x27;t use full stems for some reason</li>
      <li>this makeup lasts 6 hrs easily( all day with a &amp;#34;modeling spray&amp;#34;) and looks  very natural .I</li>
      <li>And to be honest, the coverage between their foundation and their tinted moisturizer really isn&#x27;t that drastically different.  </li>
      <li>While I like what is in the ingredient list for this foundation very much, it does not blend well into my skin.  </li>
      <li>I have been converting to an all natural beauty routine and so far, this is the most natural foundation I have been able to find.</li>
      <li>They need to reformulate them to be more neutral or yellow.</li>
      <li>but it was the first one I bought.</li>
      <li>This keeps my oily skin pretty matte all day (I use Andalou Naturals oil controlling bb cream underneath).</li>
      <li>My skin is so much healthier after having used this line of products.</li>
      <li>I could see how this foundation might be a bit drying for some people with already-dry skin, but it works very well for me.</li>
      <li>Yes, it&#x27;s fantastic and the tub will last you for almost a year.</li>
      <li>I really like this foundation.</li>
      <li>The coverage is thinner than I&#x27;d like, very lightweight.  </li>
      <li>Not enough coverage, doesn&#x27;t go on smooth.</li>
      <li>This probably isn&#x27;t good for dry skin - it can stick to flaky dry patches.</li>
      <li>It dries very quickly so since I have dry skin</li>
      <li>b/c I really wanted to love this product due to the natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>i have to mix it with varying degrees of moisturizers depending on the season to have it go on smoothly and not make my skin look dry.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t touch your face and let it sit,  the foundation lasts a decent amount of time.</li>
      <li>I have been looking for a natural foundation for a long time and this one is my favorite so far.  </li>
      <li>I still use my high end foundations (Dior, YSL, Nars) when I&#x27;m feeling fancy</li>
      <li>The only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is, by the end of the day it starts to break down a bit, but it seems fine for a full work day.  </li>
      <li>I have used so many different foundations and am looking for an all natural paraben free and it&#x27;s not easy!</li>
      <li>I though the white peach would be a tad darker on my skin but turns out it&#x27;s actually too light as If I bought it in creme.</li>
      <li>The shade range is quite limited, but if you have pretty decent skin to begin with, there is wiggle room for shade play.</li>
      <li>I was half expecting the color to be too dark because I&#x27;m pretty pale, but it&#x27;s a great match for me.</li>
      <li>It covers red really well.</li>
      <li>I have combination oily skin and sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It was light weight enough to put on top of my moisturizer (also 100% Pure), and it made my skin smoother for putting on base.</li>
      <li>I love this brand, I am addicted to their body care products and have been for some time.  </li>
      <li>But, even though this product was a fail for me, the brand itself is spectacular.  </li>
      <li>I emailed 100 percent pure &amp; the company is not willing to replace defective merchandise.</li>
      <li>but like other posters have said, it is very drying.</li>
      <li>It really tones down the redness in my skin.  </li>
      <li>The consistancy very thick likeca cream which I like, however, I didn not find it easy to put on.  </li>
      <li>I have to recommend their honey almond butter for overnight face cream if you have dry, sensitive skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was disappointed right off because the pump was broken. I decided to try and work around this but the color was so off I looked like I should be on Broadway. My skin tone matches the picture shown on the website so I was saddened that the color of the foundation was so far off base. I returned mine and didn&#x27;t want to bother with guessing colors again so I found a different brand I could try in a store.</li>
    <li> The ingredients are absolutely beautiful and I respect what the company stands for. The foundation is somewhat hard to blend compared to conventional foundations, but mixed with a primer or a facial oil and applied with a damp sponge, it works well enough. The shade range is quite limited, but if you have pretty decent skin to begin with, there is wiggle room for shade play. The packaging feels quite luxurious, which is an added bonus. If you don&#x27;t touch your face and let it sit,  the foundation lasts a decent amount of time. Personally I would give it a chance just based on its ingredients.</li>
    <li> This is my fave-o-rite &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; foundation. I keep searching for a cheaper one but keep coming back to this because sometimes you get what you pay for. The only issue with it is if you put it on and get flash photographed at night, the zinc in the sunblock makes you look like Edward bloody Cullen. I&#x27;m a vampire. Oh well. Sunblock good.</li>
    <li> The color was way too light &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a natural foundation for a long time and this one is my favorite so far.  In my opinion it has excellent coverage and is not shiny like some of the others I have tried.  I do have facial redness too, and this covers it well.  I use a make up sponge to put it on and it goes on very easy and looks awesome!</li>
    <li> This stuff could be great for super super oily skin. This stuff is so drying even with the primer. It doesn&#x27;t stay on nice for more than 3 hours. I can&#x27;t drink water without it leaving a white residue around my mouth. I does cover redness... like after you wash your face redness. It&#x27;s horrible covering zits. I had 2 and if your dry around those area&#x27;s, it WILL show. So I won&#x27;t ever buy this again. I will only get the powder and tinted moisturizer.</li>
    <li> this is what i use when i want a heavier coverage for special occasions or performances.  it is a great product.  a word of caution, however, to those with dry skin-this product contains rice starch which makes it a liquid to powder finish.  i have to mix it with varying degrees of moisturizers depending on the season to have it go on smoothly and not make my skin look dry.</li>
    <li> I really like this foundation. After deliberating, I ordered the white peach tint instead of the creme. I was half expecting the color to be too dark because I&#x27;m pretty pale, but it&#x27;s a great match for me. It neutralizes redness on your skin but doesn&#x27;t look orange, which is awesome. I also use a moisturizer before I apply this. When it&#x27;s on it has the feeling of powder instead of a cream or liquid foundation which can sometimes be too moisturizing for me as I have medium/oily skin. I could see how this foundation might be a bit drying for some people with already-dry skin, but it works very well for me. Doesn&#x27;t irritate, has a pleasant smell and it&#x27;s much more natural than the high-end toxic cosmetics that I was paying a ton of money for before.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this foundation. It has great coverage (medium, which is amazing for a natural foundation) and stays all day. It applies best with a brush and if you use just a little more than you&#x27;re used to so it doesn&#x27;t dry as fast. 100% Pure doesn&#x27;t use full stems for some reason so I store mine upside down and shake it before using. This keeps my oily skin pretty matte all day (I use Andalou Naturals oil controlling bb cream underneath). This probably isn&#x27;t good for dry skin - it can stick to flaky dry patches. I still use my high end foundations (Dior, YSL, Nars) when I&#x27;m feeling fancy but I honestly usually wish I&#x27;d used this instead! For color matching reference - I&#x27;m nw10 in MAC and this shade (white peach) is a bit too dark (still wearable though, especially in summer) but it was the first one I bought. I mix a tad with creme to warm up my complexion a bit.</li>
    <li> Foundation is great but there was no pipe attached to the pump, meaning no foundation could actually be pumped out of the bottle! Seriously?!</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin then you may want to pass on this product because it will just accentuate the dry skin (looks caky and flaky).  It&#x27;s too bad b/c I really wanted to love this product due to the natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this foundation but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me. Not enough coverage, doesn&#x27;t go on smooth. It&#x27;s pretty thick and cakey. I have used so many different foundations and am looking for an all natural paraben free and it&#x27;s not easy! I love the powder but that lasted me 2 weeks! So this brand is very expensive and you don&#x27;t get very much. I had to return this because the price doesn&#x27;t match up and it doesn&#x27;t cover the imperfections.</li>
    <li> My skin is so much healthier after having used this line of products. It goes on a little thick but can be combined with some moisturizer to lighten it.</li>
    <li> Applies really well, super silky! I love the finish and the feel even after wearing it for an extended amount of time. Guilt free also because it is so skin loving and also silicone free!</li>
    <li> Love this foundation. It dries very quickly so since I have dry skin I add face moisturizer right before application. I love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> through the decades , I&#x27;ve tried  very many foundations .I have an oily &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; zone with dryness in other areas . this makeup lasts 6 hrs easily( all day with a &amp;#34;modeling spray&amp;#34;) and looks  very natural .I have to gown-up occasionally at work, so I do perspire at times --but the makeup stays on .Also, it doesn&#x27;t cause dryness or creases around my eyes ..I&#x27;ve stopped trying other foundations several months ago .</li>
    <li> This breaks me out. :( The coverage is ok, and I wish I had chosen the lightest color, but I am planning on waiting to use this past the expiration date, in hopes that the sunscreen in here, which I believe is the culprit of breaking me out, loses its potency.</li>
    <li> I have been converting to an all natural beauty routine and so far, this is the most natural foundation I have been able to find. Plus it&#x27;s make with fruits which add more nutrients to your skin...bonus! I was worried about  the color matching, but after reading a bunch of reviews, I chose this one and it looks great! I have fair skin with yellow undertones so it&#x27;s really hard to find the right shade for me. I purchased three items from this brand and I am excited to try more of their products.</li>
    <li> I really like this foundation and along with a few others, have been using it for several years. It covers well, feels light, and has great ingredients. The only thing is the shades are slightly on the orange side. They need to reformulate them to be more neutral or yellow.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get the reviews where they say its not full coverage because on me it is and I&#x27;m by far perfect skin! I love it I have oily skin and it wears well looks natural and feels good on and love the ingredients!</li>
    <li> Quality of makeup is good but the pump does not work very well.</li>
    <li> I love this product, coverage is really good considering the great ingredients. It covers red really well. I am diving into this line of products and my skin is looking great.</li>
    <li> The coverage is thinner than I&#x27;d like, very lightweight.  Doesn&#x27;t do well at covering hyperpigmentation and melasma.  And to be honest, the coverage between their foundation and their tinted moisturizer really isn&#x27;t that drastically different.  Again, I find comfort in the fact that this is non-toxic, but don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll stick with it for the long term because it doesn&#x27;t fully do the trick for me.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t see for sure, but I think this is the primer I&#x27;m reviewing (sorry, using my phone). This is not only an excellent brand, but also an excellent primer. I have combination oily skin and sensitive skin. It was light weight enough to put on top of my moisturizer (also 100% Pure), and it made my skin smoother for putting on base. Seriously, it looks like I airbrushed my make up on. I usually also have problems with skin allergies, and this product has never broken my skin out. Cannot recommend enough!</li>
    <li> While I like what is in the ingredient list for this foundation very much, it does not blend well into my skin.  The consistancy very thick likeca cream which I like, however, I didn not find it easy to put on.  It would look smeared on my skin, it wouldnt soak or blend in like my usual foundation.</li>
    <li> The make up goes on very dry.  I feel like I need a moisturizer under it.  It covers well.  The top push button device doesn&#x27;t always work so I have to open the bottle and tip it out to get the product sometimes.  It&#x27;s not really a great value for the money although I appreciate the natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  I recommend it.  I use this and I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> You have to use it with some sort of primer because it&#x27;s hard to spread and blend. Also it feels like glue and smells like glue. I though the white peach would be a tad darker on my skin but turns out it&#x27;s actually too light as If I bought it in creme. The color on the website and swatches is really dark compared to actually when you put it on your skin..,,, ahhh disappointed but I&#x27;ll still use it.</li>
    <li> The pump broke &amp; the foundation is too thick to pour out of the bottle. I only had 1/4 of it gone &amp; now I am unable to use it. I emailed 100 percent pure &amp; the company is not willing to replace defective merchandise.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. This product is super matte when you first apply it to your skin, I have oily skin and it even was too matte for me. I recommend using a moisturizer underneath. If you have big pores, this product is not for you, it will accentuate them! Even with the 100 percent pure primer underneath, this foundation did not go on smoothly on my pores. This foundation is medium coverage, and if you want to build it up, I strongly recommend that you don&#x27;t wait between layers because this foundation will dry and if you apply another layer on top it will cake up. The lasting power for me was about four hours until I needed to touch up with powder as my oil started to show. After touching up, the foundation lasted me a good ten hours. I love that this product is natural and vegan, but I&#x27;m thinking about purchasing a more moisturizing natural foundation so I can mix it with this one so it goes on smoother during application. Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with this product. :)</li>
    <li> I love this brand, I am addicted to their body care products and have been for some time.  This foundation is wonderful because it is completely natural and non toxic.  But, my only issue with it is that it lasted a very short amount of time and provided little coverage.  The color was spot on, and I tried applying more, but then it looked cakey.  I have returned to my original powder foundation.  But, even though this product was a fail for me, the brand itself is spectacular.  I have to recommend their honey almond butter for overnight face cream if you have dry, sensitive skin.  Yes, it&#x27;s fantastic and the tub will last you for almost a year. It&#x27;s about four times as big as their specific face care products, and half the price.  I have tried several, and keep going back to the butter!! Love it! Their lipstick/glaze is also fantastic.  Super creamy with very beautiful colors.</li>
    <li> Too dark for my complexion. I would need to be an Oompa Loompa!</li>
    <li> This foundation is great. It is a touch darker than I would like for my skin tone but it&#x27;s not so bad that it&#x27;s noticeably too dark (I&#x27;m really pale). It goes on nicely, blends well and is build-able for more coverage if you need it. That coupled with the fact that it&#x27;s all natural ingredients makes it awesome, in my opinion. I would definitely recommend this foundation.</li>
    <li> I was so pleased with this product.  It really tones down the redness in my skin.  I&#x27;ve been looking for healthier alternative for make-up and skin care and this brand gets a good score on Environmental Working Group.  The only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is, by the end of the day it starts to break down a bit, but it seems fine for a full work day.  I&#x27;m looking forward to trying their other products.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get it to pump out, so I opened it up and the stem to the pump was broken.  I did put some of it on, and it does not cover well, and it settled in pores.  Overall, YUCK!</li>
    <li> colour matches perfectly, applies easily and does not irritate the skin. non greasy/oily, pleasant matte finish</li>
    <li> Really good coverage, I like it - but like other posters have said, it is very drying. Still worth the purchase for me.</li>
    <li> This item is a pressed powder, not a liquid as pictured. I would&#x27;ve used this product but the product that was shipped to me was completely broken with powder spilled everywhere. I realize this is a shipping problem but I was also disappointed that it was not a liquid foundation. The powder DID feel incredibly silky on my fingers but I didn&#x27;t end up trying it on my face because I returned it immediately. I received my refund immediately, which was very nice!</li>
