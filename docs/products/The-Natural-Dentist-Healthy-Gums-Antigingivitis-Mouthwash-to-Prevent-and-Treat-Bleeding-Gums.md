<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it s ok but  flavor is horrible,</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing ! My gums were sooo sensitive and bled so much and after a few days of using there was almost no blood. Two weeks later , absolutely no blood !</li>
    <li> This product is a bit hard to find but if you can find it...GET IT and USE it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;My husband has gum problems as a side effect of the medication that he is taking. This mouth rinse has made a big difference in the swelling and bleeding of his gums.</li>
    <li> I have always had very sensitive gums and a lot of the foods I eat bother them.  My dad and granddad were dentists and they always had me use pain-a-lay to rinse my mouth.  Strong stuff but it became an acquired taste.  I decided to give this Natural Gums a test run and am quite please with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While not a miracle drug, my gums have improved since using this rinse  and my dentist commented on a couple of areas I was having trouble with as being much improved.  I like the fact that there are no artificial ingredients in the product and the spearmint flavor is pleasing.  I&#x27;ll continue to use as long as the results are favorable.</li>
    <li> We find this oral rinse superior to the various other \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; options we have used.  We can use a small amount daily and we do see results with the rinse and flossing daily.  Taste is refreshing as well.  Our favorite is the peppermint flavor.</li>
    <li> It has not stopped my gums from bleeding</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any changes to gums. Went through the entire bottle.</li>
    <li> Great product. Really helps improve gum health. Delivered on time! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has issues with their gums or simply wants to keep them healthy.</li>
    <li> Healthy Gums Mouth Rinse is beneficial to over all healthy dental care; I use the rinse twice a day. The rinse has a pleasing taste with no after taste. I would recommend this product to any one interested in dental care.</li>
    <li> My gums have always bled and I&#x27;ve tried all types of otc toothpastes and even things from the dentist such as gingimed and nothing has made an impact. I received this product 2 days ago and I can already tell a difference. It doesn&#x27;t sting or make your eyes water like listerine but you still get that clean feeling. I&#x27;m 100% sold. Can&#x27;t wait to see long term results</li>
    <li> Bottle was 1/2 empty when it arrived as it leaked out into the shopping box.  Love the product though.</li>
    <li> use this if you don&#x27;t like to swish chemicals in your mouth !</li>
    <li> Good dental mouthwash</li>
    <li> My periodontist recommended this product because I have problem gums.  I find this rinse to be wonderful.  Thank you for creating it and producing it.  I am very pleased with it.  Janet Edgar</li>
    <li> For the price I won&#x27;t buy this again; and I bought it after the item description said it was good for sensitive teeth as well yet no where on either of the labels is that indicated.</li>
    <li> I was having white/rough gum problems (I&#x27;ll get my teeth cleaned every 6mo. from now on!), and purchased Peppermint Twist at the Walgreen&#x27;s store (only flavor they stock)?&lt;br /&gt;It tasted AWFUL, aftertaste lasted hours, and Really Dulled my taste-buds (same with natural Mint mouthwashes... I&#x27;ve tried!)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered  [[ASIN:B00HBNJ816 Natural Dentist - Healthy Gums Daily Oral Rinse Orange Zest - 16.9 oz.]] online (Much cheaper at iHerb!)?&lt;br /&gt;It tastes Good (mild), No aftertaste/taste-bud problems!&lt;br /&gt;My gums turned pink in 2 days!  :o)</li>
    <li> I am using it for about 2 weeks and it seems help my gum.&lt;br /&gt;I think it is very good natural rinse.</li>
    <li> As a tobacco dipper, this heals and cleans up my mouth leaving it feeling like I never had a dip in my life. No burn and a pleasant taste. I&#x27;ve ordered several more bottles and recommended to my friends.</li>
    <li> Excellent as mouthwash for gums... there&#x27;s a little bit of citrus taste to it, but if you don&#x27;t mind that it&#x27;s an excellent mouthwash, with the aloe it feels quite soothing and yet cleansing for the mouth and gums.</li>
    <li> This is my third bottle. I won&#x27;t be without it! I was always told I had bad periodontal disease and after using this for a few months I went to a new dentist and was told my periodontal disease wasn&#x27;t bad and didn&#x27;t need treatment! This was the first time in 25 years that any dentist said that!</li>
    <li> Personally, I have had red and bleeding gums that I have had to baby for years and I have tried every new type of mouthwash that came out. Not one of these helped UNTIL I tried The Natural Dentist Gums. And I totally recommend this to you for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) This rinse is thick and seems to coat my gums better, after using this, my gums actually feel good and so so clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Yes, this began working really the first day and better and better each day as it calmed down my irritable gums!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) My gums look healthier and are not red anymore, they are getting to be more and more pink and feel great now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) For me, I plan to keep ordering this as this is the only rinse that works on my gums and has stopped the redness and the bleeding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this to you if you want to take great care of your gums.</li>
    <li> Great stuff all natural and great for gums</li>
    <li> I use this mouthwash all the time and love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. Finally found it at a reasonable price on Amazon. I&#x27;m SO glad. It really makes my mouth feel fresh.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This is the best \\&quot;organic\\&quot; mouthwash that I&#x27;ve used. The product uses aloe vera as it&#x27;s active ingredient and works quite well. The shipping was good and it arrived early.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this oral rinse at Whole Foods and have not had a chance to get back there to buy it again.  I was very happy to see it on Amazon.com.  I have had excellent results with this oral rinse.  My gums were starting to get pockets and the dental technician advised me to get a good oral rinse to use twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Service at Amazon.com is superior. I find myself using them for more and more products and I like that I can read a review on most of the products before I buy them.</li>
    <li> I use it only because it was recommended by my dentist. I think it is overpriced and of questionable efficacy. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This stuff contains 20% Aloe Vera.  It has a light, not unpleasant, cactus-y taste kinda halfway between light peppermint and lemonade, but mostly aloe vera.  It seems to work pretty well.  Aloe Vera acts as a soothing, almost mild anaesthetic agent, and this one definitely makes my hurting gums and tooth roots hurt less just 3 min or so after use.  I don&#x27;t know whether the gums are getting well, or whether I just can&#x27;t feel half of their pain any more, but it definitely makes them feel better.  Aloe vera is used on the outside of your skin to repair skin damage after sunburn, so I have high hopes that it is helping my gums to grow back as well.  I guess that would take a few weeks, so I can&#x27;t tell yet.  I am using this in combination with the big gun G-U-M PerioShield, &amp;#34;Drain-O for your Mouth&amp;#34;, that kills bad germs and plaque but is really nasty; along with TheraBreath Fresh Breath Oral Rinse, a light-gun baking-soda concoction that  cleans your throat, tongue, and teeth, killing some germs and cleaning your breath but not much else; and Great Oral Health Oral Probiotics, to put healthy germs back in your mouth after you kill everything with those.  The Aloe Vera is sort of a medium gun that covers stuff the others don&#x27;t.  I can use it a few times a day, it is NOT nasty nor vile.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Had a major gum problem after using a natural toothpaste for 2 weeks.  Swished this around my mouth for a couple of days and it cleared up completely.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  Great product and tastes good.</li>
    <li> I tried this for a few days and my gums got worse (more sensitive).  With all that aloe it would probably be good if you got sun-burned gums but i won&#x27;t try it again for any other periodontal conditions.</li>
    <li> Good product, works as advertised.  Very refreshing taste.</li>
    <li> Not a bad taste and after using it twice I think I see a difference in the amount of blood gushing out of my gums after I floss and rinsing with this, but will need a bit more time to fully evaluate.</li>
    <li> Great mouthwash, tastes good, makes your mouth feel clean and fresh, and reduces any gum problems</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews... But this product seriously stopped my gums from bleeding every day. It took about using this two times a day for 4 days straight for my gums to completely stop bleeding. Best product ever. I feel so much better going in for cleanings now. I went today for a cleaning and my gums did not bleed. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great for bleeding gums!  My gums stopped bleeding completely in about 2-3 weeks with just using this after flossing.  This was about 2 years ago. I really prefer this than the deep cleanings my dentist made me undergo.  I had bleeding gums again last month, and used it again after flossing every night and again cured them.  Alone won&#x27;t do much but if you combine it with flossing daily, it really helps!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to switch over to organic/natural personal care products and got this one while searching for a mouthwash to replace my toxic chemical ones. I LOVE this product. I have what is called a &#x27;geographic tongue&#x27; -not as horrific as the images you&#x27;ll see if  you google it- but enough to bother me. I truly think that this product has helped with that problem- as well as keeping my mouth fresh and clean. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> Good price, product arrived in the promised timeline, although it was sealed, there was mouthwash in the plastic bag (not a lot).</li>
    <li> I bought this because I am having some problems with my gums, but when I use it my gums seem to get worse. The flavor is not bad, and it doesn&#x27;t burn. I am sticking with Listerine for my gums.</li>
    <li> My gums feel better when I use the natural dentist.</li>
    <li> Taste good hope it will help my gum condition. Has good reviews.</li>
    <li> I wrote you guys to tell you when it was received the bag was wet and most of the bottle leaked out inside the bag.  Just have a problem with Amazon and faulty goods or trying to return something...just go through hell. Not hell taking my money though.</li>
    <li> My gums stopped bleeding after 4-5 days!  Completely natural and healthy!  You need to get used to the fact that it will not taste like regular mouthwashes, but your mouth will thank you for it!!!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this from WF for one of my kids, who didn&#x27;t use it.  I had been having sore gums in the back of my mouth for three months; then I would get a metallic taste while flossing.  I have always maintained good dental habits, so I didn&#x27;t get why this was happening.  I used Listerine Naturals, which tastes great, but wasn&#x27;t helping my guns.  One evening, I noticed this rinse sitting there on the vanity, so I tried it.  No lie, my gums began improving immediately.  The soreness began going away, and within a couple of days the metallic taste went away.  I&#x27;ve been using it every night for one month, and my gums are completely healthy.  I will use this rinse forever - please keep making it!</li>
    <li> I like this product and use it most every day.  At times, I use it in place of toothpaste.  Taste is okay too.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, definitely recommend adding to your oral care routine. The taste takes some time to get use to, but after a few uses you get use to it. I only use this product once a day, combined with Listerine and ACT. Works great.</li>
    <li> This product, Healthy Gums, truly worked for me.  I had pain at my gum area, between two teeth, where food was getting caught there.  This helped the problem of pain and irritation that was causing to the gum area.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Amazingly enough, this product is cheaper ($8.99) at CVS</li>
    <li> I have not taken proper care of my teeth like I should have. My gums bled every time I brushed my teeth, quite a lot and they hurt even though I was brushing properly. Since I started using this even just in a weeks time they bleed a lot less. I bought this product because I felt like I was heading to Gingivitis. They still hurt a little when I brush but I think it requires more time on this product and a trip to the dentist to check everything out. I used to use Listerine and I felt the ingredients were too harsh. I wanted something healthier, plus something that tastes good. Also, I had some tartar build up on my bottom teeth. Some of it fell off, at first I thought I had chipped my tooth but it didn&#x27;t look like a tooth part. I&#x27;m not sure if this product helps tartar or if it just fell off because I&#x27;m taking better care of my teeth but still happy.</li>
    <li> This cruelty-free, animal-friendly rinse works well as a mouthwash, despite a slight cinnamon taste, which I don&#x27;t normally care for.  The overall taste is fine, the packaging is efficient, and the cost affordable, especially for a small, well-intentioned company.</li>
    <li> I like how this works, but there is a strange sensation in your mouth. Sometimes burning, sometimes leaving the mouth feeling like it&#x27;s completely dry and like a suction reaction. Another variety doesn&#x27;t burn, but I don&#x27;t feel like it helps bleeding gums as well as this variety.</li>
    <li> This is the best remedy for sore gums, canker sores, or other oral afflictions. Heals overnight! I order always 2 at a time when I run out.</li>
    <li> Does a good job. Helps w/any gum problems &amp; taste &amp; smell are refreshing. Just started using it so I can&#x27;t say if it will help long term.</li>
    <li> Trying to get all the bad chemicals out of the house, I decided to try this based on other reviews. You most definitely don&#x27;t get the burn you get with Listerine. The flavor is also hit or miss. It is indeed very pepperminty, but the aloe-vera based recipe has indeed helped with bleeding gums in my family.</li>
    <li> Makes your mouth feel clean with out the use of chemicals. I love this product and the toothpaste as well. Amazon is has the best price too.</li>
    <li> The is an excellent product which can help prevent gum disease.  I used to have bleeding gums and no longer do thanks to using the rinse.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product has helped with gingivitis, is soothing, has a pleasant taste and is reasonably priced.  It contains many natural herbs.</li>
    <li> Nice taste, really works to stop the bleeding after I floss my teeth. I don&#x27;t feel like my rinse is killing me when I use it. This is a good thing.</li>
    <li> Good product I will continue buying and using. It is best product to solve gum problems.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Nice taste. Would like to see the price come down because its value may be tough vs others out there.</li>
    <li> This is a good alternative to alcohol based mouth wash.&lt;br /&gt;The flavor is fine and doesn&#x27;t leave a weird after taste.</li>
    <li> While I have only been using this product a couple weeks my gums are noticeably more healthy.  The redness and tenderness has gone away and my mouth just feels better.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash turned my gums from an unhealthy red color to a much healthier pale, pink color.  I am very enthusiastic about it.  I&#x27;m glad also that it&#x27;s a bit gentler than alcohol based mouthwashes.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mouthwash to treat my gums, because it is so embarrassing to go to the dentist and have to be told your gums are bleeding.  The mouthwash doesn&#x27;t taste great, but my gums do not bleed anymore.  I can&#x27;t wait to go in for my cleaning to see if they bleed when the hygienist starts cleaning my teeth.</li>
    <li> I think it is good for my gums but it repeatedly caused nausea even after using only a very little.  Must be one of their flavors.  I do well with aloe vera, so it isnt that.  BE PREPARED FOR NAUSEA IF YOU BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I have bleeding gums and this rinse worked fine, I have to say it didn&#x27;t stop the bleeding, maybe my issue is bigger than this product can do, but helped out in diminishing it. I&#x27;ll buy it again, much better than listen for sure!</li>
    <li> I order this all the time.  It&#x27;s natural, and I have had significant improvement in my gum health.  I use half a capful every night before bed, and sometimes in the morning.</li>
    <li> This is very good mouthwash. It really does stop bleeding gums. And it tastes good. I&#x27;m no longer able to use drugstore mouthwash, which, after using the natural kind, tastes like nasty chemicals. I take prescription medicine that makes my mouth taste bad, and this mouthwash fixes that for hours at a time, which is a great relief. Nothing else I&#x27;ve ever tried has done it as well.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Soothing with a fresh clean taste. Excellent for sore gums after dental/orthodontist work. Good value , fluoride free, apparently no irritating chemicals.</li>
    <li> After reading a number of reviews I decided to buy this at Walgreens.  The Natural Dentist website has a $2.00 off coupon so I printed off a few.  The regular price at Walgreens is $7.49 (cheaper than Amazon).  It is on sale right now for $5.99.  Therefore with the coupon I was able to buy them for $4.00 each which is less than half the price that Amazon charges!</li>
    <li> Fabulous. Really works! I never want to be without this stuff.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a natural product that could help my gums problem. When I was pregnant my gums starting started bleeding. After the the deep cleaning this product along with a tea three tooth paste have helped me to get rid of that and my mouth feels clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> One question i have to use it two time in the date? and if you use it you have to watch the mauth with water i need some one explain me</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend of mine with advanced gingivitis. Because of the damage to their gums, using regular mouthwash burned so much that they had to stop. According to them, in less than a month of usage, their symptoms have vastly improved. Furthermore, this mouthwash does not burn at all, making it easy for them to use on a regular basis. I would recommend this to anyone experiencing gingivitis symptoms, especially if they want to avoid the alcohol in other mouthwashes (fun fact: alcohol is a terrible way to disinfect wounds. While it does kill the bacteria, the burning sensation you feel is actually from the surrounding tissue being damaged. This, ironically enough, makes the wound more prone to infection).</li>
    <li> I finish a whole bottle but i didnt notice any improvement, i wont buy it again.</li>
    <li> We use these for my kids and love it so far.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t help me at all.. used twice a day religiously but failed. Went to a dentist and he cleaned my teeth.. Problem solved.  Don&#x27;t waste your money just go see a dentist</li>
    <li> Buyer beware. This contains polysorbate 80. Listed on the bottle you receive, but not disclosed on the description.</li>
    <li> I suffer from canker sores so I can&#x27;t use anything that contains alcohol in it.  Unfortunately I also had bleeding gums.  My choices were extremely limited.  So I started rinsing with hydrogen peroxide.  I was concerned about using hydrogen peroxide for an extended period of time so I googled mouth rinses that do not contain alcohol and came up with The Natural Dentist.  I was lucky enough to find it at my local Whole Foods.  The price is comparable to Amazon.com.  Used it and found it did the job wonderfully.  No bleeding gums.  No canker sores.  My dentist also mentioned how clean my teeth were at my last check-up in June.  I must add that I floss, rinse, brush with a Sonicare toothbrush twice a day.</li>
    <li> By far the best natural mouthwash on the market at an affordable price. Wish it was carried at stores up north but all we have is Wal-Mart and Shopko and neither keeps it in stock. Health food stores go with Jason or Tom&#x27;s. So I am very grateful to be able to purchase Natural Dentist through Amazon and its partners. Ingredients truly do help those of us suffering from peridontal/gum issues.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  Nice taste and you do not need a lot.  This is my first bottle and time will tell if it is working for me.</li>
    <li> Worked good enough for me to buy it again.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this mouthwash. Why don&#x27;t more commercial mouthwashes have aloe in them? It&#x27;s an anti-inflammatory that has helped keep my ongoing battle with periodontitis more managable. I prefer the cinnamon to the peppermint but it isn&#x27;t offensive tasting. I would highly recommend this over alcoholic mouthwashes.</li>
    <li> Works great! Very soothing on my gums, reduces bleeding, and has a pleasant taste, though it takes getting used to (aloe). My dentist recommended an alcohol free rinse, and this fits the bill perfectly!</li>
    <li> This is some good stuff. Very mild and stopped my gums from bleeding. Not sure I&#x27;ll buy it again because it is a little pricey for the size you get.</li>
    <li> This is a great, natural product that supports oral health.  It has eliminated any minor bleeding of my gums and is also wonderful for gargling to keep tonsils clear and healthy.</li>
    <li> This rinse does everything it promises and more.&lt;br /&gt;My dentist had me come in for a cleaning four (!) times a year, because my gums were bleeding and receding and I had some bone loss. I started using this rinse a year and a half ago and the bleeding stopped. My gums are healthy and strong, and teeth that were wobbly are now staying in place and.... I only go in twice a year now, which saves a bundle. My dental hygienist now recommends this rinse to other patients. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Great stuff! We use for my son when he gets cold sores in his mouth.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist, I&#x27;ve been using this for a year and love it. Glad to find that I could get it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Amazing taste, incredible benefits, and all for an incredible price! The shipping time was *beyond* amazing - it felt like I&#x27;d barely clicked through to order it before it came to my door! I am truly impressed. And the price is much cheaper than I can get it anywhere else in town, even *after* shipping!</li>
    <li> My gums definitely feel better using Natural Dentist mouth wash compared to using generic mouth washes.</li>
    <li> The best mouthwash I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve been a type 1 diabetic for 7 years and it&#x27;s super important to keep up with the health of my mouth. I love this mouthwash because it actually feels soothing, and doesn&#x27;t have the burning sensation of Listerine. For as long as I can remember, my gums have been sensitive to flossing and brushing. After three days of using this product, my gums were significantly less red and didn&#x27;t swell or hurt when flossing. I actually ran out of this product a month ago and thought I could live without it- but the sensitivity slowly returned! I immediately went out and bought another bottle.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff.  completely cleared up my gum bleeding which was pretty bad at one point in time</li>
    <li> I notice my teeth feel cleaner and gunk gets out better with this mouthwash.</li>
    <li> My husbands gums stared receding this has natural elements that kill bad bacteria &amp; gum Candida</li>
    <li> Very good product one day I tried it, it worked recommend to people with bleeding gums!</li>
    <li> I used this rinse after brushing with an electric toothbrush, and my last cleaning was so easy.  Less scraping and no issues.  Try it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m prone to gingivitis, and my dentist has noticed the difference since I started using this. My gums are in much better shape, all without using nasty chemicals with weird artificial flavoring, like other gingivitis rinses. The natural flavoring of this product takes a little getting used to (not bad, just different), and I actually like it now. I like that it&#x27;s gentle and soothing while being very effective. I would give it five stars, but the bottle gets messy. After you put the cap back on, the residual product left over in the cap leaks out.</li>
    <li> Very good for gums with natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> Did not help with any gum issues and also felt odd after rinsing with this. Was inclined to rinse again with water.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my naturopathic dentist.  Perfect transaction, thanks.</li>
    <li> When I was abroad, I used a Chinese all natural mouthwash and I never had any problems with receding gums and unhealthy color, but when I cam e back to the United States, I found the average alcohol kind dries out your mouth too much and does not help my gums at all. ACT brand and fluoride rinses are terrible and gives you a severe sore throat when I wake up after I use it before bedtime. The natural dentist peppermint twist is even better than the Chinese herbal mouthwash. My gums are now a healthy pink. If you buy a mouthwash, this one should be it.</li>
    <li> The taste is nice, waiting to see if the product helps my gums stop bleeding which is the reason I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Such a great product.  Finally Amazon dropped the price a bit.  It had been less expensive at Walgreens but now, as an &#x27;add on&amp;#34; it is more affordable.  Product tastes wonderful, does not have any of that overly sweet after taste and keeps my gums in great condition.  Truly a worthwhile product.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I purchased this rinse.  I might purchase it again.  This rinse is quite different than any other rinse purchased previously.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for quite some time. After I started and went to get my teeth cleaned, my hygienist was impressed.  I put a little in my water pick and it does a wonderful job.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I use this as a mouth sore rinse, and I absolutely swear by it.  Rinsing with this nightly before bed if you have cuts or sores in your mouth will cause them to be better in the morning, and using it for a vigorous swish and spit for about 5 minutes before a meal will eliminate the pain of food rubbing against your mouth sores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this to my dentist, and highly suggest you try it with your difficult to heal mouth sores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works wonders.</li>
    <li> I am so thankful for your products.  I am dealing with chemo therapy and it is causing me to have sensitive mouth issues which is a common side affect.  Your mouth wash and tooth past products are great and do not have any harsh chemicals that futher aggrivates my mouth.  I would recommend these to anyone who wants a more natural product.</li>
    <li> Read the reviews and I don&#x27;t mind the taste.  This does work to aid in reversing bleeding gums.</li>
    <li> I floss everyday and my dental appointments are always disappointing. My dentist recommended this product to me after my last appointment and my bleeding gums stopped in a week. The ultimate proof of performance for me is the outcome of my next dental appointment but I&#x27;m quite pleased with the product so far.</li>
    <li> This really works to stop gum bleeding!</li>
    <li> Good feeling, and refreshing. The taste is a little different than traditional mouthwash, but you can tell the aloe is really moisturizing. I didn&#x27;t have an issue with bleeding gums, as this is recommended for, but my dentist suggested it, as it&#x27;s alcohol free, and at my follow up appt., was told my gums were looking much better!</li>
    <li> It whitens my teeth too!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, it actually worked and helped with my swollen gum and bleeding gum.</li>
    <li> This stuff really seems to help ones gums heal, even though the active ingredient is simply aloe.  I was using another of their mouth rinses, but this one did much better for me.</li>
    <li> I have had a bit of  bleeding gums when flossing and brushing for years. Always used listerine and found out it was harsh for me. Like I said for years my gums bled a bit when brushing. But after two months of using this it has completely stopped and my gums look and feel healthier. I feel the aloe Vera does the trick.  Its now been four months using this and no signs at of bleeding. I kid you not this stuff works and live by it. I highly recommend this and again like I said for years I had the bleeding gum problem.  I buy mine from CVS, sorry amazon.</li>
    <li> Love this rinse.  It&#x27;s healthy, free of all those nasty chemicals and has a great flavor.</li>
    <li> Has made a huge difference for me! Will order again.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist!</li>
    <li> refreshing taste, cleaning properties</li>
    <li> All natural mouthwash is great for sensitive and bleeding gums. If you smoke use this and floss and you will stop gum disease from developing or getting worse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice and the bleeding in my gums has already gone from red to pink.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, my gums don&#x27;t feel as sore anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Grant it, I have been using a homemade toothpaste with baking soda over the past week but the bleeding was still heavy and RED until I started using this.&lt;br /&gt;And the taste is wonderful and refreshing with zero stinging.&lt;br /&gt;It is awesome so far, and I will keep you posted on how things are going in a few days.</li>
    <li> My favorite mouthwash. Although the price at times is ridiculous on amazon.</li>
    <li> The natural dentist peppermint twist mouthwash has help decrease my bleeding gums a lot.&lt;br /&gt;The mouthwash has helped with my bad breath as well. I would recommend this product to&lt;br /&gt;anyone who is dealing with gum problems.</li>
    <li> Was having issues with sensitive gums even though I floss every day and brush with a Sonicare.  This product is gentle but very effective.  I cannot use mouthwashes with alcohol anymore - they are just too harsh.</li>
    <li> Love the way it feels  in my mouth, leaves teeth and gums feeling clean and refreshed.  We even  rub a small amount  once a week on our dogs gums.  He loves it and his breath and gum health have improved.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a skeptic at heart and even after reading all the positive reviews I was still unsure about whether or not to check out this product. But since I have sensitive gums that always seem to be sore or bleed after flossing I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot anyway. Literally, after the second use I felt a huge difference. No more soreness and no more blood. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now and the difference is incredible. I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough as it actually tastes good and doesn&#x27;t burn like other rinses.</li>
    <li> Taste good and helps soothe the gums.</li>
    <li> I am pregnant and have had a lot of trouble with bleeding gums. I switched toothpastes to a clay based/natural one, and that eliminated the bleeding within a couple of days. Now a few months later I occasionally have had bleeding again, and a little bit of soreness. I bought this to help...and it made my gums worse! After a few days my gums were bleeding like crazy...like around every tooth in my mouth. It was honestly terrifying. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s me, the fact that I&#x27;m pregnant, or what, but it definitely did the opposite of what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> Very strong flavor but my gums have bot bled since I have used this.  Not even while flossing. I would recommend it to my friends and family for sure. My young child likes it too!!</li>
    <li> My wife uses it and is very satisfied with the product and service.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful product!!! I cannot believe how fast this mouthwash has worked with bleeding gums. It has surpassed my expectations and I will be regularly ordering this from now on. It leaves your mouth with a clean and fresh taste and not too over powering. I like the fact that it is natural and aloe vera has many great uses. Extremely satisfied with the outcome. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I am uplifted after using this product, simply because of the extraordinary taste.  I like knowing that this rinse contains aloe vera!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. I had some dental work done and my gums were bleeding bad. I rinsed my mouth with this rinse/mouthwash and it stopped the bleeding and my gums healed well. It also helps with bad breath. I highly recommend this. It works!</li>
    <li> I have used your rinses for quite a while. they are totally satisfactory.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s helping my gums, but that taste is a doozy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The peppermint twist flavor is so gross, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it. The mouthwash is a mixture of mint, grapefruit and cinnamon oil, and they hit your tongue in that order. Not the best combination, but it&#x27;s definitely made my gums stop bleeding when I brush. Plus, the green color is amusing when I rinse, so there&#x27;s that. Definitely give this a shot, but be prepared for a weird taste!</li>
    <li> Good taste and helped with bleeding gums</li>
    <li> excellent - once a day</li>
    <li> For close to two years I was using a natural mouthwash that I was paying $26.00 a bottle for from my dentist. I was about to run out of that and I came across this mouthwash on Amazon and decided to try it. It works just as well, if not better than the mouthwash I was getting from my dentist. My gums hardly bleed anymore. Thanks Amazon for carrying this fine product.</li>
    <li> I have not tried this product yet but will be ordering it based on all the outstanding reviews!  I do appreciate all the reviews. I have bleeding gums and my dentist told me I would need 3 treatments at a cost of $130 each. I can&#x27;t wait to try this mouthwash and for my next dental visit so he can see the results!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist.  Not the nicest flavor but ok.</li>
    <li> Ships fast, taste great and works really well, the effects last long. I don&#x27;t mind the cost... I think it is worth it, I have ordered it several times and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I use this sparingly as it is very expensive.  I use the cap:  1/3 product, 2/3 water.  Almost immediately my gums felt better.  Apparently the key ingredient is aloe vera so I may try adding aloe vera juice to my other cheaper mouthwash to see if it is effective.  My local grocery store sells this mouthwash cheaper than on-line or the local health food store.  When it goes on sale I stock  up.</li>
    <li> This is a nice natural mouthwash. The taste is mild and it does not burn my mouth like alcohol mouthwashes. It works well, but all I have to warn about is to shake well before use.</li>
    <li> So I had a nasty looking gum line on one of my lateral incisors- top tooth and I was so self conscious about it.  I don&#x27;t know how I injured tissue, but it was ugly yellowish for 9 months.  I decided to try this and a week later my gum is healthy pink again -thank god!!!  I was thinking about getting a gum graft because it looked so bad.  I don&#x27;t typically have gum issues, healthy pockets and no bleeding- but this stuff saved me.  Makes my gums feel great!</li>
    <li> funny tasting, but soothing. Not astringent like other mouth washes. Has a slight lubricating effect for a dry mouth. (Bonus!)</li>
    <li> I have been using this mouthwash for a few weeks. I am VERY pleased with it. It tastes nice and minty, with a hint of the aloe. The best part is that it does not burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I done mouthwashing with it, my mouth does feel quite clean. I have also noticed that my gums have bled a lot less often after starting to use this mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can not be 100% it is due to the mouthwash, but I reckon it is. Avoid those harsh alcohol based mouthwashes and get something natural that works great!</li>
    <li> Love it &amp; GREAT taste!</li>
