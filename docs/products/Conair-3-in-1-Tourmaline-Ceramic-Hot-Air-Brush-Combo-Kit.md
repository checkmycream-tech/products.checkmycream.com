<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just what I expected. Works great.</li>
    <li> I have seen this item on TV i did not think it would dry out my hair as much as it does.Makes it kind of frizzy.</li>
    <li> My hair is to short for the bushes to work real well.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for quick drying-styling of longer hair. I appreciate the quality and ease of use.</li>
    <li> Like it.  Dries my thick hair quickly. Haven&#x27;t quite figured out the brushes yet but will.  Still use a straightening iron with it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and received it overnight on Friday. Yesterday I was able to try it out.  Works very well and even dried my wet hair quickly.  I have shorter hair and the barrel of both brushes work well.  It styled my hair very nicely and left it nice and full and smooth.  Didn&#x27;t take time to try the blower attachment, but both brushes are great. Very good deal for the price.</li>
    <li> The verdict is out on this because there are very little instructions on how to use it. It was recommended by my hair stylist and I guess I will check with her on how I should use it.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  Great product.  I can style my hair in half the time.  I would recommend to all my friends.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK... But my hair still frizzies.  I thought it would have been alot better and tamed the frizzes. OK</li>
    <li> The air brush got too hot for my hair, maybe a defective one?  But I sent back.</li>
    <li> the airbrush was awesome ; except, i have small hands and also have arthritis in them and I had to hold the barrel with both hands. I&#x27;m really sorry I couldn&#x27;t use it because I really need one with a smaller barrel. THANKS!</li>
    <li> I bought this hair drier in an attempt to replace a Conair drier that I&#x27;ve had for at least ten years.  This one is very similar, but is larger, which I don&#x27;t like.  It does the job, however, and I am satisfied with it.  It&#x27;s the closest thing I can find to my old one.  I bought two others which were totally unsatisfactory before I found this one.</li>
    <li> Wow, where has this been all my life? I dried my hair with my regular drier about half way and then used the hot air brush. Just a few minutes later my hair was perfectly styled, soft, and smooth! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It looked interesting, being able to shape your hair while drying it. Perhaps saving an extra step. But it turned out to be very awkward. It didn&#x27;t really curl hair well. The hair gets caught in the brush unless you are very meticulous about how you wind it up. Makes hair a little frizzy. I would return it except it wouldn&#x27;t be worth paying the extra shipping. I am getting surgery on my right arm and won&#x27;t be able to use my arm, so I will hang on to this as it will at least brush my hair and dry it, slowly, with one hand.</li>
    <li> well...this product is not gonna get my  hair straight.  it does nothing for me.  doesn&#x27;t get that hot.  its only 1000watts.  if ur black, and u want hotter heat to straighten ur hair, look at Revlon 1500watts.  or try to find something hotter than that.  more watts.. but ive searched and searched and hottest ive found is 1500. if you need a blow dryer, look at the 1875watts. i got the vidal sasson and i love it. if u need a root straightner, look at Babyliss root straightener it gets as hot as 450.  good for our hair.   you know we need the hotter the better for our hair....</li>
    <li> I admit, I just got this hot brush and am not good with hair or hair styling tools but ick, this thing doesn&#x27;t do a thing for my hair. Well, I guess it will dry it but I don&#x27;t see any &amp;#34;style&amp;#34; to it, it&#x27;s just floppy, dried, hair no matter what I do.</li>
    <li> This is not a good Air Brush perhaps because it is so inexpensive.. I burned out my first one with a wattage surge in Europe and bought this as a replacement.  The brush falls off as you are drying your hair, the hair gets very tangled in the bristles, and the roller gets really hot -- I&#x27;ve blistered my finger a few times. I  should have bought a more expensive version.</li>
    <li> This product is not what I expected. 1. The diameter* of the handle is so big, it was difficult to hold and turn without accidently turning the on/off settings. *After seeing the product, I believe the handle is so large in diameter because the motor is in the handle. It also made it heavy to hold.    2. The brushes were described as .75\\&quot; and 1.25\\&quot;. However, that is the size of the cylinder, not the total width; they were too wide for short to medium length hair.</li>
    <li> This Conair hot air brush is durable and works great!  I had previously purchased a similar Revlon item that only lasted a month before the attachment snap broke.  Conair is a much better product!</li>
    <li> I love this hot air brush! It works quickly...I use it to dry my hair, not just style it. The brushes are easy to change and help get rid of my frizzies. Looking at the picture, I realized I completely forgot about the air concentrator...I&#x27;ll have to give that part a try. Could be very useful for under the hair above my neck. I risk getting spasms if I go out with wet hair and get a chill on my neck or right shoulder. So getting my hair dry, and quickly, because I am impatient, is important to me.</li>
    <li> I have owned this Hot Air Brush for a year and a half and I cannot say enough good things about this product.  My naturally curly straightens out beautifully using this Hot Air Brush.  I don&#x27;t need my hair pin straight so I don&#x27;t use a flat iron.  I like some body to my hair and this brush does just that.  It takes the curl out of my hair but it leaves my hair full of body and without flyaways.  It comes with 3 attachments: a blow dryer attachment and 2 brushes.  The larger brush has a line of bristles and then a line of plastic pins sticking out and then another line of bristles etc. I have to be careful using the large brush because if I move to quickly to brush my hair the plastic pins poke me in the head. lol  Just something to keep in mind when using the large brush.  The small brush does not contain any plastic pins, only bristles.  I am guessing the plastic pins in the large brush help move the brush through the hair so it doesn&#x27;t get tangled around the bigger brush and so the hair is separated in order to properly dry the hair throughout.  I really think you will like this Hot Air Brush as much as I do.  I have not had any problems or issues with this brush and I have had it for almost 2 years.  : )</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a blow dryer and round brush to style my layered, collar-length, thick hair for over many years, and I have no problem getting the look I want. However, I don&#x27;t have as much luck when I try to use the brush and dryer on my 8-year-old daughter&#x27;s hair, which is one length to her shoulders. It just felt like I needed a third hand to make it all work with her thick hair! I decided it was time to try something new, and I&#x27;m glad I chose the Conair Ceramic Ionic Hot Air Brush! I was able to use it successfully on myself with the first try, and it gets easier and easier. The fact that it has different brush attachments is a real plus for me since I get my hair trimmed about every 6 weeks to keep the layers in shape. The smaller brush is perfect for when it is newly cut and a bit shorter, and once it grows for a week or two I can move up to the larger brush. The third attachment would be useful for drying any hair style in a manner similar to a regular hair dryer, although I don&#x27;t think I will use it in that way. I had good results with my daughter&#x27;s hair, too. Because I don&#x27;t have to use one hand for a brush and another for a dryer, I have a free hand to divide her thick hair into sections, which makes it possible to dry it much more quickly. I can give her a cute flip or a soft under curl before she gets bored and impatient! I think we will both get a lot of use from it, so it was a good deal for the price.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware.  The forced hot air comes out at the base of the brush sections, with minimal hot air coming from the brush section, causing the area not being dried to burn.  Example, if you were using this on the sides by your face, your face will get berned before the brush even started drying/styling your hair.  I threw this away and bought a Hellen of Troy unit that I love.</li>
    <li> I would say that this is a wonderful product. It works well does what it is suppose to do. Amazon shipped it quick too, which is really nice because I was buying it for my mom. One thing that I didn&#x27;t really like was how big the handle is. It&#x27;s just a little harder to use when the handle is too big. Overall my mom loves it and uses it 4 times a week. I give it one star off because of the big handle, which was my mom&#x27;s only complaint.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice that it comes with two brush options and a concentrator attachment - but for me there were some real cons:  * The cord is really short; you need to have a plug in above the counter-height to make it the most user friendly - and I&#x27;m only 5&#x27; 3\\&quot;  * I was hoping to use this instead of a hairdryer and round brush, but your hair has to be almost dry to use this. Guess that&#x27;s fine if you have long hair (as shown in the pictures), but it doesn&#x27;t work well for shorter, fine hair that needs to be styled from the moment you start drying it or it will be stick straight.   * The diameter of the handle is too big; it makes it cumbersome to use.  * This is REALLY loud, much louder than other hairdryers I&#x27;ve had.  This all could be due to the fact that it&#x27;s not a high end brush/dryer; maybe you get what you pay for. Glad I got it on a Lightening Deal.</li>
    <li> Bought this based on a TV commercial and the reviews here. I absolutely love this device. I use it daily now. Makes a total difference vs. blowdrying / then using the straightening iron. Now I can do both in one fell swoop!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really thick, wavy hair and this straightens/curls in one--plus adds tons of volume. Think Pantene Pro-V commercials. Really can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. It&#x27;s definitely changed my morning routine.</li>
    <li> Great product used for years on my curly hair,  nothing else works as well.</li>
    <li> This product is not what I wanted or expected. The brushes are very hard. They cause terrible static and the worst part is that it is extremely loud. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Oh yes, indeed it is.     And to think, I swapped this out for my Tigi bedhead curling iron, figuring  a ceramic hair brush is sooooooo much easier on your tresses!     Fortunately, I only singed about an inch of the front left side of my hair and no I did not leave it on too long -- we&#x27;re talking moments.     Granted, it was on the High, 1000 watt setting. However, there are only two settings -- high and low, with nothing in between and no cool shot either.     The high is really really hot -- not so much the air temperature, but the ceramic plating, which they laid on nice and thick so that it&#x27;s super-conducive.     The ceramic is of such high quality that the low setting may well have been warm enough for some serious styling; unfortunately, along with lowering the heat, they lowered the air velocity even more, so low doesn&#x27;t have the drying power.     Evan at that, I&#x27;d consider keeping it, except the power switch is in a really awkward place, as other&#x27;s observed, and I fear I&#x27;ll accidentally set it on high.     I&#x27;m extremely disappointed, not just because reviews were so good but because the unit is built like a brick house -- very sturdy indeed, given today&#x27;s shoddy manufacturing standards.     After calling Conair customer service, I think I&#x27;m going to try a cheaper, less powerful version, Conair 2-in-1 Hot Air Styler, 1\\&quot; &amp; 3/4\\&quot; Model BM20XCS.    Or alternatively, I may try Conair 1 1/4\\&quot; Instant Heat Hot Brush, Model BC86RCS, which doesn&#x27;t blow hot air (it&#x27;s a curling iron with bristles) but it does get raves everywhere and has 25 different heat settings.</li>
    <li> This is the best $20 I have ever spent on a hair tool.  My hair has been fried by getting permed and colored, and while trying to get my natural straight hair to slowly grow back having straight roots and frizzy permed curls looked ridiculous.  I didn&#x27;t want to re-perm it and I didn&#x27;t want to use a flat iron because my hair was already so dry.  I was considering the In-Styler but it seemed like too much of an \\&quot;As Seen on TV!\\&quot; gimmick.  I&#x27;m glad I got this instead!  I used it on damp hair with a blow-dry protectant cream (John Frieda Smooth Start) combed through.  AMAZING!  I simply started at the roots and rotated the brush to wrap my hair around it and slowly pulled it through.  Everything was dry and styled in 10 minutes!  Not frizzy and not dry feeling at all.  I applied Paul Mitchell Skinny Serum afterwards to protect from humidity.  I don&#x27;t think my hair has looked this good in a long, long time.  It&#x27;s perfectly straight up to the ends where there is a very loose, soft wave.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought 5-6 Conair brushes and have always found the to be better-designed than competitors&#x27; products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first ionic hot air brush I saw was Revlon, and I decided to try \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; to see if it really made a difference. It did. As other reviewers of this product have posted, \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; really does dry faster, hold longer and stay sleeker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later I saw the Conair ionic, and decided to buy it, since I was unsatisfied with two things on the Revlon: the grip is very large, and therefore somewhat uncomfortable and unwieldy for my hand; and the switch is located in the \\&quot;waist\\&quot; of the product, where the grip narrows, and it&#x27;s not unusual for my hand to slip up there and accidentally flip the switch off, even though I am conscious of having done that tons of times before and try to avoid it. I thought these problems with the Revlon product would be corrected by Conair, since generally Conair is better designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They weren&#x27;t. The Conair brush has the exact same issues. In addition, the clip that secures the interchangeable brush attachment to the handle only latches on one side of the brush, so when you are pulling the brush away from your head, and applying pressure to straighten and \\&quot;sleekify\\&quot; the hair, the brush starts to become misaligned with the handle. I always have to put my finger on the \\&quot;cool-touch top\\&quot; at the end to avoid the risk of the brush attachment snapping off the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is so uncharacteristic of Conair that I give them the benefit of the doubt - seems like I must be missing something about why anyone would design a product with that built-in weakness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So net-net - the product does great things for your hair. I just wish it were built with a little more attention to the design details that would make it easier and more comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> I love this hair styler. I bought it first at target years ago, but like everything one day after it broke and couldn&#x27;t be found anywhere again but here. It&#x27;s very easy to control and I couldn&#x27;t go without it</li>
    <li> just need  this now when blow drying my hair.</li>
    <li> If I knew that this existed sooner, I would have bought one a long time ago! This thing is awesome. It does the job of three tools - a curling iron, a  blowdryer and a brush.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent air brush. The ionic feature leaves my hair very soft and silky.  The only problem is sometimes when holding it with your hand in the middle it slips into another gear.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work that well. It is Conair, so the results were to expected. The top part of the blue piece kept coming off, so the comb and brushes would fall out every time I used it. I had to use glue to fix it. You have to use it carefully because it burns you very easily. I recommend investing in something else if you don&#x27;t want to waste your time and money.</li>
    <li> First off... a little bit of my hair history... I naturally have curly frizzy dark brown hair and for years I bleached and did regular deep conditioning treatments and my hair stayed moderately healthy until I started using a ceramic flat iron on a regular basis. The iron completely fried my hair and it started to break off... BADLY!     So over a year ago I dyed my hair red... in hopes that no more bleaching would reverse some damage... nope. I finally realized it was the iron... So deep conditioning treatments... and salon visits to try to save my breaking hair is finally working... I no longer use dye... just a color depositing conditioner.     I went from a flat iron to a flat brush and blow dryer, but my hair was super frizzy and not pretty and tangled easily and just looked fried.    I stayed with a friend in cali and used her hot brush on my wet hair... holy moly... it worked great! I looked everywhere online and found rave reviews for this one and it&#x27;s wonderful!!!!! I use a heat protection spray on my wet hair and dry it with the ceramic hot brush and wow... it comes out smooth and frizz free and I can run my hands through my hair and it&#x27;s way quicker then most methods and it&#x27;s easier to walk out the door with a style cause my ends are curled... it looks like I walked off a photoshoot and my hair was professionally curled with lots of bounce.    GET THIS HOT BRUSH!</li>
    <li> This brush performs as advertised -- very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review before, but I was so happy with this product I just had to comment. I&#x27;ve purchased several hot air brushes--different companies, different models--and they all STUNK. This one is GREAT. I have dyed hair that looks frizzy and unhealthy when it dries naturally. This brush smooths out my hair, leaving it shiny and silky in no more than a few minutes. Definitely don&#x27;t bother with other models.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself based on favorable reviews, well it lasted two months and died. I have fine thin hair, the motor area was clean and so was the brush area. My last hot air brush lasted two years and I thought that was poor performance. Conair, this is a horrible product, great while it works, but not worth the money for the time I had it.</li>
    <li> I had one of these and loved it, but after years of use it wore out.  I went back to Target to replace it and found they no longer had it.  I went on Amazon and found it and with Amazon Prime, it was at my house in two days.  Why didn&#x27;t I just do that in the first place?</li>
    <li> I have never been able to do my hair all by myself, but with this incredibly usefull tool: oh My GoD!! I am able to have results very close to salon style.  I am so happy I don&#x27;t have to go to the hair salon anymore.  I am buying a second one as a spare and to keep it in my daughters room!!</li>
    <li> This is like the 4th one I have bought for my wife.  The problem with it is after about 6 months to a year the middle speed/dryer switch position burns out.  I finally took apart the last one to see what exactly is happening.  The switch position just slowly looses its contact so it will not operate on that setting.  So then she gets mad, throws it out and buys a new one.  She likes the way it feels, heats, etc.  So based on our experience if you want to keep buying them over and over ... you get the picture.</li>
    <li> I use this to calm my really curly hair and it works great.  It makes my hair soft and smooth and going in one direction rather than all different directions.</li>
    <li> The hot air brush really works. I have always struggled with using a brush and a hairdryer at the same time to get the smooth look I want, so I&#x27;ve always relied on a regular dryer and a straightening iron. With this product I barely need the straightener. It does get a little hot, but that&#x27;s to be expected. I use the diffuser attachment to dry my hair til it&#x27;s only slightly damp, then I use the larger brush attachment. My only complaint is that the attachments are a little stiff and difficult to switch, but I hope this will get easier as I use it more.</li>
    <li> recieved as a replacement for one that was broken while traveling abroad.&lt;br /&gt;I love the look of a salon style blow out. Hair looks healthy and shiney and is oh so soft. Well this was great! The first try with this one pulled off a perfect salon style blow out. I have shorter hair, chin legnth, the longest my hair gets is shoulder legnth. If your hair is longer I am not sure I would reccomend it as the brush is harder to weild, and your arms would have to go outforever to reach the tips of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;To use I start at the roots wrap the hair over the brush let it dry the roots partially for good lift. then i brush down the legnth of the hait to the tips and roll it up leave it there for a few seconds and brush out. I repeat this method a few times on each section of hair. The section size used is about 3 inches wide and 1 inch deep or less. for me the process takes about 10 mins or less to fully dry my head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;This can be used on wet hair or damp. I would never use a dryer on dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was the fact that it advertizes as a ceramic ionic dryer. The only brush that is Ceramic is the large one, perfect for my hair, but maybe not perfect for yours. As it goes, my old one had a little button that you hit for the ionic setting, this one has none, so I can not be sure that it is ionic.&lt;br /&gt;I think others will like this product a great deal. The price is far better than I paid for the other one years ago, and it&#x27;s a Conair, my experience with conair is that it tends to last a LONG time!</li>
    <li> If you have long, thick hair, don&#x27;t bother wasting your money on this \\&quot;dryer\\&quot;.  I had to have a substitute dryer that had a brush and/or comb feature to get through my hair.  I thought this one may do a good job (first time I&#x27;ve tried one like it), but I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong.      After 30 minutes (using both high and low) the hair on my scalp was still damp to wet, the ends were flying and frizzing like nobody&#x27;s business, and there was no way to style the hair around my face without ripping skin with the bristles.    The handle is extremely large and way too slick; my hand kept sliding all over the place, hitting the high/low selector button and slipping up onto the barrel of the brush part - OUCH!  There needs to be some sort of \\&quot;stop\\&quot; rim put up there to keep your hand from hitting that and getting burned!    Time to go back to the tried &amp; true Vidal Sassoon 1875 - that one really DOES work!  This piece of junk is going back!</li>
    <li> My old one quit working and I thought I would have a hard time replacing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So happy to have found it here.</li>
    <li> I wish I could find a hot brush that works better than this. It creates static in my fine hair, and leaves crimp marks from the barrel if my hair is damp.</li>
    <li> The Hot Air Brush works really well.  It makes drying and styling my hair so much easier than the old separate blower and brush.  My only problems are that it gets too hot to handle at times and it doesn&#x27;t have dual voltage for foreign travel.</li>
    <li> I initially bought something similar to this from Walmart and it did NOT do the job.  I finally figured out that it didn&#x27;t have enough heat coming from it and wasn&#x27;t nearly powerful enough.  If you have frizzy hair you really need HEAT, so look for the 1000 watts in your heat stylers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began to look for alternatives on Amazon, found this one, and bought it.  It works wonderfully!  I use the middle attachment (the blue one with soft bristles) every day just when my hair starts to dry by itself.  It smooths out my hair but still leaves it wavy and volumized.  I love this!  It&#x27;s amazing what a little extra power will do for your hair.  :)</li>
    <li> I got this hair dryer on May, 2011. It&#x27;s broken after 5 months. It only blows out cold air. I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have long, layered hair and like to use a round brush to blow it back and create the waves I like. Many years ago I had a similar dryer but it was discontinued. I searched and found this. I actually do the initial drying with another 1500 watt dryer with a brush attachment for 4 minutes, then take over with this, with the round brush at the end (the firm one, comes with 2). Within 5 minutes, I have the most beautiful head of hair I have ever created. The curls stay for the rest of the day and if I have to redo it a little, I don&#x27;t even have to moisten it, just the heat does it. It is smooth, not frizzy and whatever ionic means, something about this is different than anything I have ever used. I hope this is never discontinued and I hope the insides don&#x27;t dry out if left in the closet because I plan to buy a bunch to last me forever. This is honestly one of the best products I have ever gotten and I&#x27;ve told everyone about it. It&#x27;s worked manage on my usual flyaway hair. I used to have to put gel on it the first day after washing and now it doesn&#x27;t stick out anymore...I don&#x27;t need the gel. Try this, you won&#x27;t be sorry...it&#x27;s fantastic and magical!</li>
    <li> I bought this and did not know what to expect. I paid 10.99 for it and I feel I got a freat deal! I love it easy to use. No need for al the extra brushes its all in one place.</li>
    <li> Shorted out soon after purchase. I should have returned it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 10 years and love it. Amazone have a very good price. It makes my hair fuller and shine.</li>
    <li> Disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t have a shot of cool air feature, but it&#x27;s okay for occasional use only since it seems to dry out my hair.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly, easy to use and does exactly what I wanted it to do. I recommend it highly for anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this rotating brush.  This is my second one, I have been using this model for 6 or 7 years already.  I found the small brush very good for my particular hair.</li>
    <li> I love this beauty tool. Have had it for a couple months now and it shows no signs of dying out. Unlike my previous 2 hot air brushes from Hot Tools, which burned out relatively fast. Great value for the price and have not found anything better.</li>
    <li> This tool is the best of its kind on the market!</li>
    <li> Bought this after reading such great reviews, but I have to say this product is not for me.  It is very loud, it made my hair fly all over the place and gave me a lot of static.  Not happy with this product, sent it back and bought the Revlon 444C instead and love it.</li>
    <li> Was really hoping that this would be great after reading the reviews, but was quite disappointed.  I&#x27;ve got very fine hair so that could be part of the problem, but I&#x27;ve used other hot air brushes before and this one just really didn&#x27;t compare.  Was looking for added volume and unfortunately didn&#x27;t get that at all.  Can&#x27;t say that I could recommend this purchase.</li>
    <li> I had one for years and loved it. I took it to Europe and due to the different wattage i fried it. I tried to buy another brand and hated it. I bought another one and I am very happy again. It is sturdy and you dry and model your hair at the same time very quickly!</li>
    <li> I wanted to love it and was recommended by a friend to give this brush a try, but it just didn&#x27;t do it for me.  My current hair dryer is the T3 Featherweight and is very quick at drying my hair with minimal fly-aways, but I still wanted to try the hot air brush to get my hair to curl under/wave without also maneuvering a brush.  Unfortunately, the hot air brush is very loud, my hair tangles easily in it, and can only handle a small section of hair at a time.  I have a very full head of very fine hair and it took me forever to use the hot air brush.  If you&#x27;re like me, you may want to stick to your hair dryer + brush or hair dryer + curling iron.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item by mistake but when my hair curler gave up the ghost I was forced to use it. To my surprise it actually did a pretty good job. the only problem with it is that it gets hotter than I like.</li>
    <li> I had an older version of this product which broke and I was reluctant to get another one because I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be as good and would be too expensive. I was pleasantly surprise. Much better than my previous one and at a great price. I hate using so much heat from curling irons and flat irons simply to put a slight curl in my bangs or my ends. This is a lot easier without the excess stress to my hair.</li>
    <li> Combination brush and hard &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; works well.  Better than the one I had with either brush only or, hard rubber only.  This grabs the hair and releases it without getting tangled.</li>
    <li> The Conair Ionic Hot Air Brush works like a charm. My hair is dry in less than 10 minutes, my hair is shiny and easily styled. The smaller brush really does make my hair shinier.</li>
    <li> I have been using this model hot air brush for a number of years and wouldn&#x27;t switch to another product. My only complaint is that the brushes need to be replaced before the unit dies. Wish I could purchase replacement brushes from Conair.</li>
    <li> Great product! The high wattage (1000W) is a key feature. Unlike other products that are of low wattage and do not truly replace your high power blow dryer, this one does. It has completely replaced my blow dryer and produces much better results.</li>
    <li> amazing!!! i bought it as a present to my sister and after trying i&#x27;m replacing one from Revlon that i have for this one.</li>
    <li> Works well and easy to use, attachments come on and off easily and no problem using this on long hair.  Also used it without attachments when my usual blow dryer quit and it took a little longer to dry hair from wet but it worked fine.</li>
    <li> I have very thick straight hair. i followed the instructions and my hair does not curl with this product. It is a fantastic hair dryer. It usually takes me 1 hour to dry my hair with a regular hair dryer, but this dryer gets my hair dry in 20 minutes, and it does not fry my hair.</li>
    <li> I received mine yesterday 3/30/12 and wasted no time trying it! It left my hair extremely bouncy, and full of volume! I may not use the smaller one to often because it seems as if it can break the hair, but it all depends on how you use it I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonya.</li>
    <li> great product. fast delivery. very good packaging.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Thought this would solve the problem of blow drying the \\&quot;bob\\&quot;.  It is too hard to handle simply because the handle is too fat and clumsy.  The hair gets tangled in the brushes.  Turned into an expensive blow dryer.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these (one as a gift and one for myself) for Christmas. I have very tangly, curly and semi-curly hair and want to straighten it without using a flat iron or chemicals. I tried it out on my dry, product laden hair when I first received it (even though it&#x27;s meant mostly for wet to damp hair) just to test it and I  must say I was impressed! It handled my massive mess of dirty hair pretty decently (even detangled, defrizzed and straightened it quite a bit) while adding body. I only used the large ceramic brush.  It works best, I found out, when you section your hair into small 1 inch (or so) sections and that what other reviewers said about only using it on medium was correct. This thing will fry your hair on high because those 1,000 watts kick butt! It appears, according to the instructions, that the nozzle is to be used to add volume and partially dry your hair and then the large ceramic brush is for straightening, volume, detangling and bumping hair. The smaller, non-ceramic brush (made of boar&#x27;s hair and nylon bristles) is mostly for shaping, curling, polishing and adding shine. I can&#x27;t wait to wash my hair and see what it does on clean hair...</li>
    <li> If I were stranded on a desert island and could only bring one thing...this would be it (provided there is electricity!!) I have used this product for 6-7 years and it is wonderful. Works terrific on wavy, thick, hard to manage hair. I air-dry after I shower until its about 90% dry and run the hot brush thru it which creates a straight, smooth look. I recommend to anyone who has just bad hair.</li>
    <li> They seem to like it and it does help with poofy hair, their biggest complaint.  Does not burn their hair.</li>
    <li> My hair has some natural wave, is fine in diameter and texture, but I have a lot of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since I got a 1920&#x27;s-style bob, having to blow dry and then flat iron my hair became tedious and annoying whenever I was pressed for time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make things faster and easier, I bought the [[ASIN:B0009PVV40 Conair BC171CS Ceramic Ionic Hot Air Brush, Black, 1.25 Inch]]. Did it work for my hair type and hair style? Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there is a lot of room for improvement:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The switch everyone mentions. Yes, it is a pain.&lt;br /&gt;2. The air brush could use a medium heat setting. With the low setting, it takes a long time for my hair to become dry. With the high setting, I have to be careful I do not fry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;3. It could use a cool setting. Not mandatory, but it would be nice to have.&lt;br /&gt;4. A hanging loop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect for people with very full and thick hair, this air brush would would take a good amount of time to get their hair dry. Also, for people with very curly or wavy hair, this device will not straighten your hair without a smoothing hair product. I strongly suspect that for people with straight hair who are looking for lots of curls and ringlets, this may not work as well as a curling iron or hot rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For myself, it has worked incredibly well... it just needs some tweaks to make it perfect.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s latest almost 5 years. I use it on me and my dog.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d send it back if it wasn&#x27;t such a hassle for $21.99, but I still might send it back anyway. The biggest thing that I hate is that the handle is HUGE. I can&#x27;t even wrap my hand around it. My hand got very tired trying to hold this puppy up.The switch is located weirdly so you can&#x27;t turn it off/on or on low with one hand. Even though the smaller barrel is 3/4&amp;#34;, with the bristles it&#x27;s much larger so it doesn&#x27;t work on the shorter hair in the back. It also gets tangled in the hair very easily. I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it but it sounded so perfect. It isn&#x27;t, at least not for me.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a replacement for my old Conair brush dryer for years to no avail in all the local stores. Finally decided to try online, and found this one. While larger than my old one, it dries quickly. Wish they offered a smaller barrel, even if it had to be purchased separately. Hope this will last as long as the old one.</li>
    <li> been using it for years, it finally went, couldnt find one in any store, thank goodness for amazon, cheaper than conair online or any other sources. great way to style</li>
    <li> While looking for a new curling brush, I happened upon this dryer. After reading the reviews on how it gives lift to hair, I decided to purchase it. I does indeed give a nice lift, but I wish the switch was in a different location. I&#x27;m constantly turning it higher &amp; lower while drying my hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush! In the last 12 years this is only the second one that I&#x27;ve ever bought; and I only needed to because the other one fell and broke. The brush heats up quicky and for someone with long, thin hair, it dries my hair in under 10 minutes. I don&#x27;t really use it for styling per se so much as drying, but it does leave a nice wave in my ordinarily straight hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this for travel to India. I had problems with it in the beginning But it was the adapter I was using. It does not like the flimsy kind. This Hot AirbBrush gets good and hot and works just like it should</li>
    <li> The hair curling iron is great if you have thick, long unrully hair. It&#x27;ll leave your hair frizzy if you don&#x27;t know/learn how to manage the hair dryer, but other than that the hair dryer works perfectly. I have lots and thick hair, but it does its job if I&#x27;m patient...</li>
    <li> I purchased this hot air brush from CVS but found it cheaper at Harmons ($18 plus 20% coupon).  Not sure which stores are available in your area.  I tried this brush on towel dried hair with anti-frizz leave in cream and styling mousse.  I had to go over the same area over and over.  I made sure I had a small section of hair (found people trying to dry in large sections) and it did not work.  It left my frizzy and limp.  It has a low and high setting but would prefer a middle setting.  I would purchase this at a walk-in store so if it doesn&#x27;t work for you then you can return it.  I also saw it available at Walgreens.  Amazon may have a cheaper price but you are taking a risk since you have to pay return shipping if it doesn&#x27;t work for you.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I had seen a video on The Perfecter, which sounded like what I wanted, but costs $100. I did some research and found that some folks thought this an excellent substitute for The Perfecter and at a much more reasonable price, so I ordered it. Just tried it out -- twice -- and was very disappointed with results. I have short-ish hair (not real short, but not long, either) and this product just did not put curl or volume in my hair. Plus, the ionizer part is only for the wide 1.25 inch brush. The smaller brush would be a better size for me, but did not produce the curls or waves or volume I was hoping for. I suspect this would be a great product for really long hair, but that&#x27;s just not me. Also, I found changing brushes to be very difficult. The housing is really tight and you have to work hard at removing and/or installing either brush. And don&#x27;t even think about changing brushes when you&#x27;ve been using the blower -- too, too hot. Have to wait til it cools, and that takes awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must add that I really appreciate how easy Amazon makes it to return things. I have seldom had to return anything, but the process is explained well and is easy to follow. I love shopping at Amazon -- so easy to order and so easy to return.</li>
    <li> Great product with enough wattage to dry and style hair...   really nice results..I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I have used a hot air round brush for years and it&#x27;s always worked great, but it recently broke so I purchased this one.  My hair is very fine and the bristles would not hold onto them resulting in a mess of fly-aways that didn&#x27;t have any style to them at all.    I also thought the handle was very large and uncomfortable to use.</li>
    <li> I searched everywhere for this product and found it through Amazon at a great price.  I love this and use it everyday.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> It is not what i expected, the small bush should have the hard bristels too.</li>
    <li> Awesome delivery time. Product well made. Price better then from store.</li>
    <li> It was a good replacement for my old very similar in principle brush. This one has a switch positioned in a little strange place and it is easy to change a setting by mistake. It is also a little difficult to remove the brush from the dryer, otherwise it is a very good Hot Air Brush. It is light and pretty powerful on a higher setting. To curl my hair I usually use a lower setting.</li>
    <li> I should have listened to the previous reviewer who said the iron was too hot - only one setting and my hair was frizzed for a week! Maybe if it had another setting, lower, it would have been all right. I had to return it immediately. Could NOT use it. My hair is fine, and a lot of it. Maybe with different textured hair, it would be OK.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase.  I was considering not purchasing because of the negative feedback regarding design and the blower potentially being too powerful or hot.   I have thin straight hair that is cut into a bob that sits about 2 inches above my shoulders and this product works great for me.    Before I purchased this product I would blow dry my hair upside down to get body, then go back through and use a low setting on the hair dryer and a barrel style brush or a curling iron to get it to \\&quot;sit right\\&quot;.  This hot air brush does all of that is a fraction of the time.  I do most of the dry on high, then use the low setting to curl under a couple layers in the front around my face.  Also, I do think that the ceramic ionic combo has added shine to my hair and made it have less fly-aways.  At the end of a 10-hour work day (or even in the rain!!) my hair has stayed styled and cute.    I agree with other reviews about the design flaws.  The off/low/high switch is in an odd location, but I have only once changed the setting accidentally.  The size is also large, but no bigger than the handle of the hair dryer I had... I&#x27;m happy to change this one item out for hair dryer and barrel brush!  All in all, I feel like I&#x27;ve gotten a great buy and am very happy with this product.  I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments at work in the past two weeks, that I&#x27;ve memorized the product information so I can pass it along to friends.</li>
    <li> Much easier to use than a burning  curling iron.  Dry your hair and curl it at the same time.  The hand held part is a little too wide for my hands.</li>
    <li> Even though I am at a growing out point in my hair style, and my hair is still a bit short. I was able to get great results from this product. It dries and curls at once so you don&#x27;t need to hold a brush and a blow dryer at once to style your hair.</li>
    <li> I was prepared on all accounts to dislike this hot air brush. I have thin hair that is easily damaged, and I am not entirely convinced of the power of \\&quot;ions\\&quot;. I find I still need to use a really good conditioner and hair spray. But ultimately, I do feel that my hair can retain its health as I use this product. I do get some friz, which is easy enough to fix.    I wanted a dual action styling tool, one that could dry my hair as I curled it, instead of having to blow it dry first, and then curl it with an iron, and given the fact that my hair is quite thin, I did not feel this should be an issue. In my case, worst case scenario, I would let my hair air dry for a bit naturally before curling with this curling dryer.    What I got however, was more than I had sincerely hoped for.     I can dry my hair very quickly with this and get great curls in under five or ten minutes. All I have to do is curl my WET hair around the curling iron part and let the hair dryer curl it as it dries my hair. If I like, I can just use the dryer alone. But what I found works best for me is no different than how I would use a normal curling iron. I am able to spray my hair (once it is reasonably dry) with hair spray, then wrap it around the brush as I would a normal curling iron, apply the air dryer for a few seconds (depending on ones own hair)and release. What I get is are outstanding curls and body that has been way beyond my expectations!    I am SO PLEASED!    This truly is a hair dryer and curling iron all wrapped up into one great product!    The only drawback I have with this item is that I would LOVE to see a smaller wand, for smaller curls where desired. I would love to see it also feature a 1\\&quot; wand, though I believe I can play around with this and experiment a bit...     I hope to get many, many good years and use out of this product!</li>
    <li> I am incredibly unskilled at doing my hair (fine, layered, shoulder length) and the fact that this blow-dries, smooths and styles my tresses all in one go and under 10 mins is an absolute miracle. I actually walk out the door looking like a grown up put-together lady person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, there&#x27;s a few design flaws. I&#x27;ve had mine about 2 years now and it&#x27;s still going fairly strong despite a few frustrations. First off, the ring where the brush attachments clip to base gets really hot. It&#x27;s tough not to bump into it or slide your hand forward onto it and singe your fingers. Second, the switch for &amp;#34;off-medium-high&amp;#34; goes in one direction, and since that&#x27;s the best place to grip I&#x27;m always accidentally slipping back and forth and accidentally turning it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the plastic collar where you clip the brush attachment onto the base cracked on me when I packed it in my suitcase. Probably my fault but I would have thought it was a bit sturdier. Now I can&#x27;t clip any of the brushes on without jury-rigging a rubber band around it (see how fancy I am?).</li>
    <li> It takes awhile to get used to, but that&#x27;s with anything new.  Dry and style at the same time.  I know I&#x27;ll like it better than the curling brush.</li>
    <li> I bought this product with hesitation. I have thick unruly hair and no patience (or talent) for blow drying and brushing it at the same time. This hot air brush accomplishes both at the same time, so easily.  I can actually leave the house with my hair done, instead of pulled back all the time.</li>
    <li> Was difficult/awkward to handle/use.  Gave it to Goodwill.</li>
    <li> My wife texted my one day when I was at work and said she had just seen the coolest hair dryer on TV and it was $90.00.  Me being the guy I am I had to do my research $90.00 seemed like a lot for a hair dryer. After some google searches in comes this Conair unit for around 20.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit got great reviews on amazon and other sites that I could find.  When I showed my wife this unit she was very skeptical about it she could not believe that a unit that costs what this one does could even come close to the $90.00 one. After ordering this in without her permission I might add she decided to give it a try.  I all hear now is how wonderful this thing is it does things for her hair that others have not.  She uses all the attachments for doing her hair.  It has taken about 20 min off her getting ready in the mornings before work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think this unit is a great value especially if it beats a very popular $90.00 unit that is sold on TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys if your wife your girlfriend hits you up for the one on TV this is the way to go it will be better for less</li>
    <li> I have very curly, but fine hair.  I have been using this hot air brush to blow my hair out straight for years, and don&#x27;t think I would even be able to without it. I used to struggle with holding a hair brush and a hair dryer at the same time - not an issue with this tool. This hot air brush has become a part of my every day life.  I bought my first one at CVS for $30 in NYC plus tax, and I thought that was a good deal - finding it on amazon for nearly $10 less with free shipping and no tax made me a very happy amazon shopper indeed!</li>
    <li> Very good purchase for the price.</li>
    <li> It works very well.  Easy to use.  Too bad I cannot travel to other countries with it.  I cannot use a convertor.  It is only for 110 volt.  If you travel outside USA make sure your air brush can be used with a convertor for 220 volt. If not you will end up buying another air brush as I have to.</li>
    <li> As it arrived much later than the delivery date promised, I had to return the item.</li>
    <li> I like this product becAuse it has 3 different attachments and has a strong motor.  The only thing is it doesn&#x27;t have a cool air option.  Be cautious too in handling the attachments, they can get very hot and I learned the hard way.  It does the job...not too thrilled about it though</li>
    <li> Worked well enough until it didn&#x27;t. Received this October 28, 2014. In mid-February 2015, it stopped working. Completely. Dead. So I got 3 1/2 months of VERY light Received this October 28, 2014. In mid-February 2015, it stopped working. Completely. Dead. So I got 3 1/2 months of VERY light use - I have short curly hair, and I used this to dry &amp; straighten my back &amp; sides. And, I only wash my hair every 2-3 days. This dryer was not abused or over-used.</li>
    <li> Works very well the. The results are just what I wanted for my hair and style. The only drawback is the on button is in the wrong place on the wand. As you turn the brush to achieve the results you require your fingers hit the on / high / low button and change the setting. This button should be relocated toward the bottom of the unit. Overall I like the way the Hot Air Brush Works.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I had one like this 10 years ago and it broke and I couldn&#x27;t find one i liked after that. I blow dry and striaghten my hair everyday. My hair is very dry because of it! So I thought about giving on of these a try again, cuz I am uncoordinated when it comes to blow drying and using a round brush. This product makes it so easy! Works very well!!! Half the time i don&#x27;t have to even striaghten my hair after!! Love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> I have been considering the Instyler for a long time and opted to try this one first due to the good reviews and way cheaper price.  A good move!  Its not perfect, but I do like it and its pretty easy to use. I have shoulder length thick, course, slightly wavy hair.  I still have to use a flat iron on the stubborn spots if I want my hair to look really perfect - but this a so much better than using a round brush and heavy blow dryer.  The only con is that both attachmnets are not ionic -- only the big one.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser blow dries my hair straight with a dryer and a round brush, which I&#x27;ve found impossible to do by myself at home. I bought this during lightning deals for under $10, and I would have paid triple knowing what it can do. I used it as soon as the UPS guy brought it. It straightens my roots and gives my hair volume, while leaving the ends relatively smooth. No need for any other steps like curling or straightening. I&#x27;m thankful this product does what I was hoping it would do.   The only thing I would change is the location of the power button. I turned it off 10 or so times on accident in the process.</li>
    <li> First let me say I have straight hair so use a brush dryer to smooth out my hair and give a little curl at the end.  I&#x27;m not trying to create big curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used brush dryers for years.  I think this is my third or fourth one.  I just bought the Conair BC171 to replace a similar (non Ionic) version that has been a workhorse for years.  I think I had my other one at least 5 years - maybe longer.  It&#x27;s still working but the bristles have seen better days.  After years of very faithful service, it needed replacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I knew i had to replace my old one, I first bought another Conair at Target.  But it had NO POWER.  It was about like having someone blow on your hair.  I returned it.  Then, I bought a similar looking Revlon dryer.  But it allows most of the hot air to blow out at the bottom of the brush attachment with very little air to actually style/dry your hair.  Then the attachment quit staying in place and would come out in my hand.  So, another brush dryer returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, I&#x27;m seriously hoping I can find a Conair like the one I had.  Searched Amazon and boom - there it is.  I&#x27;m so thrilled.  This one is just the right size barrel - it allows you to kinda grab your hair and style it.  It has plenty of power to get the job done.  And I really like the combo plastic and bristle brush attachment.  For me, it works the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not big on leaving loooong product reviews but i figure there are other women out there frustrated just like I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATING MY REVIEW!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stand by my review above for the OLD version of this brush dryer.  That one is still running - sounds like it has a furball but still running just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the new version and it seemed just fine.  I went on business travel and packed my Conair brush dryer.  Well, a TSA agent took it apart to search for drugs I guess, and it broke.  The brush part no longer held in place.  I was so angry - &amp;*(^%#$ TSA -ripping it in half!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I ordered 2 more - an extra one just in case of another bad TSA agent.  One day I&#x27;m drying my hair, and the plastic makes a popping sound - brush part will no longer stay in place.  Whaaatt?????  Yep - just broke.  So, I open my third one.  It breaks in the same spot as the other two - right next to the on/off button.  I might have used it a few months. Sweet merciful CRAP!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey Conair - don&#x27;t fix it if it ain&#x27;t broke!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> After towel drying I blow dry for 1-2 min. with its own attachment and use brush attachment to completely dry and style my hair.  It so easy to give curves to the ends and helps to get rid of frizz.  highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This product did not work well for me at all.  It was a waste of money and now I&#x27;m stuck with it.</li>
    <li> This was my first hot air brush, and it worked quite well for about two years. Then one day as I was using it, it shot sparks out the handle and tripped the GFI. Hoping it was a one-time event (maybe some hair had been sucked into the motor?), I continued to use it. Another week passed before the same thing happened again!  My best guess is that torque builds up where the brush attaches to the main body when you use the brush, so something inside must be moving or getting compressed as you&#x27;re brushing. I was sad to have to toss it, but hair and fire don&#x27;t mix!</li>
    <li> i bought this recently and used it perhaps 5 times? and one day i plugged it in... and it doesn&#x27;t turn on or anything.  what happened?  did i get a defective one?  other than it dying on me after 5 uses, it&#x27;s pretty decent but it doesn&#x27;t really get that hot... i think i will revert back to a &#x27;traditional&#x27; hair dryer instead of this \\&quot;hyprid\\&quot; air brush... doesn&#x27;t really do anything special.</li>
    <li> I hate doing my hair because it&#x27;s long and I simply do not have the coordination or patience to blow it out. My problems were literally solved with this hot air brush. I get my hair done in about 30 minutes and it comes out amazing. It looks better than when I get it done at the hair salon. This is truly an amazing product and I absolutely love it! The comb/brush does a throrough job. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The bristles are strong, yet they don&#x27;t catch and tangle your hair like the plastic or metal bristles do on other units. The three attachments fit securely. It is helpful that they don&#x27;t wobble or come off by themselves. The power of this brush has two speeds and it is more than adequate. Best electric dryer-brush I have ever used!</li>
    <li> Works well, but it keeps getting hotter the longer you use it.  Fingers and hands need to touch gingerly!</li>
    <li> If you have 3 hands, it will work well for you.  It&#x27;s very awkward and difficult to use. Be warned.....</li>
    <li> this has helped in curling my hair when I am in a hurry.  also, this has been easy to use and handle in curling hair.  however, I wish the curl would last longer.</li>
    <li> I liked this air brush enough. It worked well for me. It&#x27;s worth for the price you pay. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer takes some getting used to. The brush gets tangled in my hair very easily and it does not turn as easily as you would think. I am not a hairdresser so I need to practice more. I think it will be good but not great.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 years .. awesome.</li>
    <li> I really appreciate the engineering combing the rolling brush with blow dryer.....Still working on managing the heat to my hand that&#x27;s holding my hair around the brush while drying....all in all it does a great job!</li>
    <li> This is one of the things she wanted specifically for Christmas.  I couldn&#x27;t find it locally (I don&#x27;t know why).  She is very pleased with it, but is still learning how to use it.</li>
    <li> My sister have been using one of this since she was in college, actually she is in her 2nd Conair hot brush, and I was very skeptical about it. I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair that much because it takes to long (I have very long wavy/curly hair), it would take and hour or more with the blowdryer and the brush, the old school normal way, and I was sure that was the best way until I decided to give it a try a couple of weeks ago...and OH MY GOD! Why did I waited so long to try it! It takes 30 mins now, I wait until the hair is almost dry and use this hot brush and my hair looks amazing, I absolutely LOOOVE IT, my blowdryer? Im giving it away for good!.</li>
    <li> This is so much lighter than the blow dryer I typically use.  It&#x27;s like a travel/daily use all in one.  I wish I knew about these years ago.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to be able to replace my hot air brush and my blow dryer with just one device.  When it came, I found that the brush attachment didn&#x27;t quite grab the hair as easily as my other one.  And the &#x27;blowing&#x27; attachment, while all right, didn&#x27;t generate enough hot air to replace a real hair dryer.  So, while it worked fine for what it is, it doesn&#x27;t replace two devices as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> I was trying to duplicate a device which my hairdresser used when I went for a cut/styling.  The handle on the this product is way too large which makes it difficult to hold and manipulate.  Also the diameter given for the brush is misleading.  It is bigger than represented.  It&#x27;s difficult to get out of the packing (you need to cut the thing apart with a saw blade) which makes returning the item nearly impossible.  I think I will ask my hairdresser if she can order one for me which is sized to fit a woman&#x27;s hand.  This is a good idea made bad because of poor design.  Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> I NEVER write reviews but after using this product I just had to! Such an incredible product, it completely changed the look of my hair and has saved me tons of time just drying my hair alone! It&#x27;s super easy to use, NEVER burns your scalp like those pesky normal blow dryers, and it just leaves your hair so silky smooth (Zohan reference!) and adds so so much volume and bounce to your hair. I&#x27;ve been using the brush for about a week now and have gotten at least 5 compliments on my hair ... my boyfriend even noticed and I could probably go from having black hair to platinum blond and he usually wouldn&#x27;t notice it, lol! I don&#x27;t understand how they can sell this product for only $20, I would seriously pay $100 for this item!!! A MUST have!</li>
    <li> I bought this item based on all of the positive reviews.  Problems I found:  Brush gets extremely hot, is difficult to hold (handle is big), and at 1,000 watts not powerful enough to dry by itself for thicker hair. I am returning and buying a regular hair dryer.</li>
    <li> ARTICLE HAS GOOD  QUALITY,MY WIFE LIKE IT VERY MUCH,IT WAS RECEIVED AHEAD OF SCHEDULE AND LOOKS THE SAME AS WAS DESCRIBED,THANK YOU VERY MUCH.</li>
    <li> This has been a lifesaver.  My hair is curly, but has gotten frizzy with age.  Much easier than using a brush and blow dryer.  The tourmaline really helps smooth things out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason for 4 stars; from day 1, only the high speed works.  But for the price, it was not with returning.  I will be ordering another for backup.  Don&#x27;t want to be without this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product about 6 months ago, but didn&#x27;t really start using it until recently.  Before, my hair was kind of long and it was a bit difficult to work the brush through it without getting tangled...however, if you have shorter hair (like me) that is also somewhat flyaway, I recommend this dryer--it&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t frizz up you hair like a standard dryer will.  I live in Seattle, and even with all of the humidity, my hair stays smooth and soft.  (It takes a teeny bit longer to dry your hair than a normal dryer, but the results and easy styling--curling your hair under while you dry, adding body--is well worth the extra minute or two.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also add that it&#x27;s very easy to travel with, as the brush part comes off and can be stored easily in a suitcase pocket.  Overall, a good hairdryer for shorter-haired people who don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of time styling.  (Also, be careful that you don&#x27;t touch the blue metal while in use--it gets hot!)</li>
    <li> This does leave your hair soft and shiny but that is it.  It gets very hot- too hot.  Also the handle is very thick and cumbersome to manipulate.  I am sending it back.</li>
    <li> Burns my thin hair. Too hot to handle to change the brush heads. And the larger brush head it very hard and can easily dig into your scalp.</li>
    <li> price is right- works great- quick delivery !</li>
    <li> I have used a brush air dryer for many years and was always satisfied, but this ionic one has the most power of any I have used. The reviews are accurate: if you have very short fine hair, you may not get the curl you are looking for. I have extremely curly hair and am always looking for ways to tame it and release some of the curl. This hot air brush does the job. The ionic part does help keep down the frizz and it is speedy. If your head is very sensitive, you may find that this is too hot for it.I have mostly used the larger brush attachment, it has a firmer grip on the hair. The smaller one has longer bristles that are also softer. I have not used the concentrator attachment, but I think it will be great for traveling, since I won&#x27;t need to haul my big blow dryer along.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my Conair Infiniti BC173 which quit working after about 7 years of use - a product I also really like if you just want to brush and dry your hair simultaneously, but I thought I could do better.  And I did with this product.  It is like blow drying your hair with a round brush, more like a traditional blow-out you receive from a hair salon.  I have never been able replicate that by myself at home, and with this dryer, I can.  My hair will never look as good as it does when I leave the salon, but using this hair dryer is as close to that experience as I can get on my own.  I would have rated it 4 and a half star because it is not perfect.  As some other reviewers have pointed out, it has a few design flaws.  The cord is too short so I do have to blow dry my hair in the bathroom using the sink outlet, which is not where I normally dry my hair.  But if you do, that will not be a problem for you.  Also, the power button to turn it from high to low to off is in the exact spot where my thumb goes when I&#x27;m using this hair dryer.  So I am accidentally either cutting it down to low or shutting it off quite a few times before I get done drying my hair, which is pretty annoying.  Otherwise, I am very pleased with the purchase for the price.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! I forgot my dryer,now I just use it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I had an old version of the conair hair drying/styler, but it took me over an hour, at times 2 hours to get through super thick, curly hair. This item is a blessing!!! it takes me 30 mins to finish drying my hair and it is always looks awesome. ive gotten alot of compliments on how my hair looks the way ive been styling now compared to how i used to straighten out my hair (blow dry then use the CHI, which makes your hair stick straight and fake in my opinion) i like the inbetween look this Conair brush gives, not stick straight but not too curly, just a beautiful styled wave. I had to buy a new one of this brushed because i loved it so much, i used it til almost all the bristles fell out!! i Tried replacing this one with another conair dryer and it just didnt come close to matching the results and speed. SO THANKS CONAIR, i love this dryer!!! Its definately a good friend to those with alot of volume, texture, and curls!&lt;br /&gt;PS.... THE RESULTS LAST! i style it in the morning and im usually great the rest of the day, even in windy or humid weather.</li>
    <li> Thank you for the great service and quick delivery of this item.  I am still learning how to use this hot air brush, but it appears to be a good product.  I recently had extensive hand surgery and this appliance has made it easier to fix my hair each day using only one hand.</li>
    <li> Sliding the power switch is TOO easy.  It is problematic while using, having to try to avoid that slight motion with your hand so you don&#x27;t turn it off or change the setting.  I&#x27;ve learned to deal with it, but it&#x27;s just a stupid design.</li>
    <li> Had the older model. It was white and had rigid bristles. Not crazy about the addition of regular bristles to the rigid ones. It does not dry and shape the same.</li>
    <li> I have used this hot air brush for a long time. Recently my old one gave out - would only heat up to the minimal level - and reminded me of the days when nothing would tame my thick, curly, frizzy hair. I immediately bought a replacement, and I am happy to say that I can again go back to looking presentable after five minutes with the new hot brush. The trick is to let naturally curly hair dry on its own till it is just barely damp, then create and tame the style with the brush. Easy and effective. Wish this had existed years ago, when it took curlers, products, and an hour with a blow dryer to make my hair presentable. Also, it is possible to get good results with this hot air brush even with only one hand - a frozen shoulder often prevents me from using both hands to style my hair.</li>
    <li> I like the product and it is what I expected. I would have given 5 stars but I get slightly annoyed with where the on/off button is.  While using the product it is very easy to hit the switch to off position in the middle of working with it.  The button glides very easily with little resistance so if you brush against it with your hand while styling it turns off.  The seller delivered the item quickly and in nice packaging.</li>
    <li> Good product.  I have curly hair that goes crazy with humidity in the summer.  This product helped a little bit.</li>
    <li> I have some length to my hair, so using a traditional  air dryer and a round brush left my arms feeling like jelly by the time all my hair was dried.  This product is amazing.  It completely eliminates needing an external round brush.  Love, Love, Love this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it daily for a few months now and it still works perfectly.  My hair is also in good condition; it has not fried it.</li>
    <li> This package is good for traveling.  Takes up no room and is light.  The attachments are a bit sharp have to be careful handle with care.  Good and bad, but does dry hair well.</li>
    <li> This succeeds in curling and drying my hair all at once. It&#x27;s definitely what I wanted, although every other row of bristles are stiff plastic. That design can create &amp;#34;ridges&amp;#34; in the hair.</li>
    <li> This tool has been a godsend for me.  I&#x27;ve always had a hard time managing a blow dryer and a brush.  This aloes me a free hand to direct the hair and hold it in place while drying.  I would give it 5 stars if it came with a glove to put on your hand to prevent burning when you are trying to style your hair.</li>
    <li> This product works great and is priced even better I purchased this for my wife without her knowing( any married man knows what a risk I was taking) She used it loved it and was even more beautiful than the natural beauty she already was The old saying goes a happy wife a happy life and I am very happy happy happy</li>
    <li> Wifes uses it exclusively, it makes her hair look like she just came back from the hairdresser. Really nice product.</li>
    <li> When my hair was longer, this hot air brush worked terribly on my hair.  It was really difficult to wrap my hair around the brush, it wouldn&#x27;t stay.  It didn&#x27;t curl it, it mostly made the ends of my hair super frizzy and dry.  After I cut my hair several inches, it seemed to work better but it doesn&#x27;t curl that well.  I had another one I bought from Amazon previously.  It worked well but it just stopped working after a few months.  I don&#x27;t really use it that often, I think becaue it takes a long time to do my hair using this, even though I dry it for the most part with a regular blow dryer.  It&#x27;s ok, but I&#x27;d prefer to have a different one.</li>
    <li> I love this set I have been looking for this one for a while now.  but it so happens that I found 2 and bought both.</li>
    <li> As someone else mentioned in one of the reviews, it would be good if the on-and-off switch was a little less sensitive. It is a matter of getting used to it, but sometimes I accidentally switch it off while styling my hair. No biggy; just something that could be positioned or done a little better.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great hair dryer. It works wonderfully! Leaves my hair with so much volume. I totally recommend it if you have short hair.</li>
    <li> Love this thing! It can do the job of a hair dryer, curling iron and hair brush and saves me a lot of time! Plus it&#x27;s very helpful when you have limited range of motion in one shoulder.</li>
    <li> Does what it promises : dries, straightens and removes frizz in each sweep. Powerful motor. I no longer need leave-on conditioners, which made hair limp in a day or two. Works for thick, long hair. Value for money</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product, you will not find in any beauty supply store. My hair is thick and long, Conair Ceramic Ionic Hot Air Brush is strong &amp; sturdy the brush snap ons will not come apart due to the turn &amp; lock in mechanism. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have thick hair and lots of it.  Hairdressers always \\&quot;comment\\&quot; (i.e. complain) about how much hair I have.  I shower at night and blow dry my hair using just my fingers.  No brushes and no product.  I then get ready in the morning and use this hot air brush to either flip my ends in our out and to just give my hair a smooth and shiny look.  Again, I don&#x27;t need to use ANY product.  This leaves my hair looking healthy and shiny without having to scorch my hair using a flat iron.  Love it and best of all it&#x27;s inexpensive.  I&#x27;ve spent hundreds on fancy blowdryers, flat irons, rotating brushes, etc.  This product is by far the best buy and it&#x27;s cheap!  Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  Oh, and my blowdryer is a Conair Infiniti Pro AC Motor Hair Dryer - Orange. [[ASIN:B003521CA2 Infiniti Pro by Conair AC Motor Styling Tool, Orange]]   Love that, too!</li>
    <li> How dare The Perfecter (lol can they even spell) repackage this same concept, give it a ridiculous name and slap on a $100 price tag???</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length hair, and this particular hot air brush has too much power (air power, in my opinion), as it just blows my hair around, and I can&#x27;t get it to stay on the circular brush to curl it.  It&#x27;s a pain to use therefore.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it because it had the 2 different barrel sizes, which is a good idea, and I wish more manufacturer&#x27;s would do this.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, they put too much air power into it, like a regular hair dryer, which this can also be used as.  It also comes with a &amp;#34;directional&amp;#34; piece for the airflow (as a hairdryer alone).  Anyway, normally I like Conair products, but they need to back off on the &amp;#34;air power on this model&amp;#34; for it to be effective as an air brush.</li>
    <li> Love how this has enough power to blow my curly hair straight using the curling brush. this makes regular hair dryers obsolete.</li>
    <li> This device helps me control the exuberance of my naturally curly (read very curly) hair.  With its help I can smooth things down and make myself much more presentable.  My only complaint (&amp; the reason it didn&#x27;t get a five) is the teeth are relatively unflexable and tend to catch in my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter thinking it would be enough for her to use and learn how to blow-dry her hair (she&#x27;s 11). I tried it out and now use it often. We only use one of the brushes, and wish it came with another one just like it... have yet to try the skinny brush.</li>
    <li> Good but loud and heats up a</li>
    <li> I just wish the diameter of the brushes were thinner, because I have shorter hair.  Otherwise, just fine. Does the job.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd purchase and the product is great.  It really does smooth out your hair and makes it more manageable.</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s compact and lightweight.  I like that it&#x27;s ionic.  It&#x27;s awkward for me to use it with the brush attachments, so use the air flow director thing on the hair dryer and use a regular brush for styling.  If you do use the attachments, and switch them out during styling, be sure to have a towel or oven mitt nearby.  The plastic gets HOT.  One more downside is that it&#x27;s not as powerful as my old hairdryer, so it takes a little longer to get my hair dried.</li>
    <li> I really like this hot air brush, the only complaint that I have is that I should have a 1.5 inch brush.</li>
    <li> Great buy. I have tried several other hot air brushes and none have measured up.  With the different sized brushes, you can create any style wanted and it leaves your hair smoothe without the frizz.</li>
    <li> This Conair ceramic blow drier/hair-styling tool is easy to use. I&#x27;m not certain where the ceramic portion of the system is, but I believe that element (ceramic) is used to decrease the amount of static in your hair when using hot air styling tools. It worked because I used it on a very cold, dry day and had no fly-aways. The device has three, easy to change out, attachments,  For the price I paid for it on Amazon I think this is a great value.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, long, curly hair.  This dryer made it bone strait, and glossy in fifteen minutes.  I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;I would use it four times a week, for five months.  Then today it just died.  I noticed the metal brush attachment would become very hot.  I also burnt myself on the brush a few times, and would have to let it cool down by the sink, away from anything that could be flamable.&lt;br /&gt;If you have thick, long hair like me, this is probably not the strongest dryer for you.  Go with something more heafty.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace one I&#x27;ve had for years. I wish I could just replace the brushes but Conair doesn&#x27;t sell them separately. I started using this when I broke my wrist about 10 years ago and could no longer use my &amp;#34;pistol&amp;#34; dryer. It works great whether my hair is wet or dry. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I wear a short straight bob or sling style.  My hair is fine and silky.  When I blow it out, it gets too big and puffy.  With this Conair Hot Air brush, I dry it section by section and it is perfect - swing and shine.&lt;br /&gt;I get so many compliments even from strangers, and now you know my secret.</li>
    <li> The metal attachment band on each brush heats quickly and you will burn your ear, neck, face, and hands with even the slightest touch. I was begrudgingly overlooking this for a couple reasons: for one, this is a low-cost styling tool; two, bristles [of larger ceramic brush] work with thick hair unlike even some pricier options; and lastly, it has 1000 watts. I bought this for moderate use, average of 2-3 times per week for a total of 10 weeks. This morning the locking clip on the styler/handle broke off during use, allowing the searing hot metal brush to be pulled off while caught up in my hair and catapault towards the side of my face. While I may not be scarred for life, I do have a large first degree burn. On. My. Face. Not to mention the multiple small burns to fingers and ears with every single use.&lt;br /&gt;Obviously the thermal brushes will no longer remain attached to the body/handle, rendering this thing useless for its advertised purpose.</li>
    <li> Very Pleased. Thanks for making this available. I will recommend this to others and tell them where I found it.</li>
    <li> This is my second Conair hot air brush, the first one lasted me for 13 years!!!  So needless to say I love it and don&#x27;t want to&lt;br /&gt;be without one.  Just make sure to get the 1000 watt one cause it has a lot more power.  I read some say it was cheap but like I said mine lasted for 13 years so I was amazed at the quality and durability.  Couldn&#x27;t have asked for more.  Use it everyday.  So glad to have found this one on Amazon cause it is difficult to come across the 1000 watt ones. Got it at a great price too.</li>
    <li> This is simply the best styling tool ever! I keep ordering more because as soon as someone uses mine, they want one of their own!&lt;br /&gt;This retailer ships them super fast too!  I receive them within days, so no long wait and everybody&#x27;s hair is looking fabulous!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  The boar bristles make hair so much softer.  The brushes are great sizes too.  I ordered two this time because this set is so hard to find.</li>
    <li> Very good product as shown in the page for a very good price !! I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
    <li> Its really not whay i expected. Its just hard to handle, bulky and really does not give any curly or style to my hair withot over drying it first.</li>
    <li> I have fine fly-away hair that would frizz on the ends, no matter what I did or used.&lt;br /&gt;I washed &amp; conditioned my hair, partially dried and then styled my hair. It worked exactly like it said and my hair is soft, smooth &amp; very shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Others have mentioned that the on/off switch is in the wrong location...I didn&#x27;t have any problems with shutting off while I was using it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m able to get rid of my blow dryer, curling iron, and straightener...and this is all I need to use!</li>
    <li> Smooths &amp; shines. I have been looking for a curling iron / curling brush for a long while and hesitated to buy a more expensive unit. This price was right and I decided to take a chance. Happy that I did.</li>
    <li> The bristles make it impossible to get your hair close to the ceramic to make a difference.  The hair just blows around.  It will dry but you won&#x27;t get a shape.  I find the bristles to make it very difficult to run the brush down your hair.  It&#x27;s just terrible.  NOT what I thought it would be at all.  I tried everything to get a wave in my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair but NOTHING!  I didn&#x27;t buy it to dry my hair- that&#x27;s what I have a blowdryer for.  This was supposed to de-frizz and/or add curls.  I&#x27;m telling you, unless you are professional stylist and there is some secret, this won&#x27;t work.  So mad I bought it.</li>
    <li> This is my second one - the first one lasted 7 years until my husband dropped it and it stopped heating up.  Very easy to handle and dries hair quickly.  The round brushes (especially the combination bristle brush) work well and leave my very thick, wavy hair smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product.  Very light weight and easy to use.  I love the attachments and was surprised how well made it was for the price.  It makes it so much easier to style my hair in the morning and makes my hair super shiney.  The only down side to this is that the air is not evenly distributed.  It pretty much only comes out of the middle to the top of the brushes and does not come out of the bottom of the brush at all.  I have fine hair so it it not a huge deal for me but I can see it being a issue for someone who may have thicker hair than I do.  I would not reccommend this to someone with thick or curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have used many brush dryers over the last 3 years. This is by far the best one for the price.  I ordered two of them, to use one, and a have a back up one or use at the gym.  I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 weeks and I think it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> This Conair product works very well. I had one for ten years and used it everyday-sadly it was falling apart-replaced it w/another. Life is good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s  a bit awkward to use and blows more heat than air. I like something with a little more air flow. I&#x27;ll most likely give it away.</li>
    <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t had much luck with this item but it&#x27;s likely my fault.  I have very thick, short hair.....bristles seems too widely separated to do what I want it to do.........but I&#x27;ll try some some.  It&#x27;s probably a really good product.</li>
    <li> I actually have 2 of these.  It does a great job in drying, styling, and making my hair shiny.  Ceramic barrel works well in taming hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only pet peeve is that if my hand slips a little, b/c my hand is a bit small for the barrel, I&#x27;ll accidentally turn it off b/c my hand will slide the wrong way.  Would be nice if they put the buttons somewhere my hands wouldn&#x27;t touch when styling.</li>
    <li> I like the different sizes and the diffuser. The one thing that is disappointing is the rotating brush. I thought the rotator was in the brush, not the cord.</li>
    <li> I read many of the reviews written before I bought this, and the things that irritated other people are true-for instance, the on/off button being strangely positioned so that you often shut if off while using-its true.  Having said that, I really like the end result.  My hair is pretty unruly, particularly when its humid, and while this doesn&#x27;t make it stick straight (which isn&#x27;t what I was looking for anyway), it certainly dries it nicely.  Wish I had bought it sooner.</li>
    <li> I have naturaĺly curly, baby-fine hair which can range from shoulder length to a layered bob. I started using hot air brushes in the early 90&#x27;s since they reaĺly work for creating smooth body. Blow dryers and the most expensive round brushes can&#x27;t come close to the results hot air brushes do! Even the best hair stylists I&#x27;ve had always say my hair looked better when I first arrived (no stylist I&#x27;ve found will buy or use a hot air brush). My years of using these awesome tools has given me the opportunity to try many different types and what I have found is this brand, size and WATTAGE is the BEST! If you get the other types with the lower watts, no ions and the barrel with strictly bendable bristles you will waste your money.........lower wattage takes forever to dry your hair and the bendable brush-like bristles give you too many flyaways.&lt;br /&gt; I always plan on my hot air brushes to last only a couple years since I use them every day......just the way it goes I guess!</li>
    <li> The handle is quite large so it is a little difficult for a person with small hands to operate it.  The product is sturdy and I am hoping I will get better at using it.</li>
    <li> I like the 3/4 inch boar/nylon option but it and the other brush are very hard to attach to the unit. Also, a couple of spots on this air brush get pretty darn hot, especially where the brushes attach to the unit. Jury still out on this one.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the truth.......I purchase two of these each time I buy.  I love this product and don&#x27;t know what I would do if I couldn&#x27;t find it any longer.  The pieces snap together perfectly, it lasts for a long time and there just isn&#x27;t another product out there that offers durability with an ease of use!</li>
    <li> My mother bought this product but finds it hard to use mostly because she is older and doesn&#x27;t want to use both hands to style her hair. She gave it to me to try, and thank goodness! It gives my frizzy thick hair just enough to tame it all.  I usually use this product after my hair has dried 75-90% naturally! this product gives me beautiful voluminous curls- for many years I was flat ironing my hair stick straight and it always looked &amp;#34;not fully finished&amp;#34;. I really can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product...</li>
    <li> The barrel is too fat so this is uncomfortable for me to hold. I also keep hitting either the on/off switch or unlocking the attachment while I use it. I&#x27;d return it for a smaller one but my husband already threw out the packaging. I do like the different brush sizes though.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I had the same model for many years. Now, it&#x27;s broken, I replaced for the same model.</li>
    <li> Bad quality. I have not been able to use it. Th eunlock and push button is stuck cannot take the brush out. Don&#x27;t know what to do with it.</li>
    <li> We bought this two years ago to use in our RV so it has not gotten a lot of use.  It quit!  It has probably been used 30 times.  Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this! Its the only (because its the best) hair dryer I&#x27;ve used for over 15 years. When it was time to buy a replacement, I bought two!! One for me and one to gift to my bestie.</li>
    <li> I love it! Delivery was faster than I expected! I use this instead of a blowdryer, my hair comes out silky smooth!</li>
    <li> I love it excellent brush,  I hope you keep it in the market. why is so hard to find it?</li>
    <li> Easy to use and quick. I can style with one hand. I was never very good with the bruss and dryer double hand method.</li>
    <li> I never used one of these before so I thought I would try it out, clearly I&#x27;m no expert. My hair is very fine, thin, wavy and frizzy. I have only tried it a couple of times so it may be a learning curve although It leaves kinks in my hair,  from the space between the brush part and the plastic comb like area on the larger brush. Its like my hair stays on the outside of the brush part,  then my hair goes on the  inside of the comb part area and that makes a kink. It does dry my hair quickly. Unfortunately for me I still find I get better results with a round boar bristle brush and hair dryer.</li>
    <li> The brushes are skimpy and it overheats on all cycles.</li>
    <li> I had been searching for a 3/4 inch hot hair brush in local retail stores, to no avail. I research one on Amazon and ordered it. I&#x27;m not happy with the product. The bristles on the brush do not hold fine hair well to allow styling. The handle would be better if it were more slender to able a senior hand better grip to manipulate the tool.</li>
    <li> Working very well and effective. light weight and hard working. item as described, I loved it, very easy to use...  Thanks!</li>
    <li> First - this item was only $22.00.  Second - it comes with a variety of attachments so it&#x27;s worth buying just to see if it actually performs to your expectations.  Frankly I&#x27;m shocked because it delivers exactly what I wanted.  It gives me smooth, silky hair and I have the quintessential problem hair - colored, damaged, frizzy but this actually makes my hair look a lot better.  I have tried the Perfector which also works but costs a lot more.  The advantage of the Perfector is that the barrel is touchable and doesn&#x27;t get hot.  This however is 1/5 of the price and if you are careful with the hot barrel and consider yourself dexterous then problem hair is solved.  I&#x27;m very impressed with this and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it.  Put some silky hairstyling product in your hair after you wash it to get out the tangles and then use this hair appliance.  I think you will be very surprised at the results.  It&#x27;s a bit noisy but that is really the only complaint I can find with it.  I am over the top satisfied and so very glad I gave it a shot.  It was more than worth it.</li>
    <li> This is the best hot air brush.  I&#x27;ve tried several others but none work as well as this one.  It&#x27;s taken me 40 years and this hot air brush to finely make peace with my hair.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this air brush last May (2013).  I did not use on the high setting because it was VERY hot.  I have not quite shoulder length hair and the heat was too much.  I did use on the lower setting and it worked well.  I did not find it to be all that much better than an older Conair air brush I already owned.  In October the lower heat setting quit working and all I have is the high setting.  I have gone back to my old reliable store bought Conair.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I completely disagree with the previous reviewer who claims that this product is excessively hot. The air coming out where the brush meets the handle is hot, but no hotter than my regular hair dryer and nowhere near as hot as other styling tools like curling or flat irons. Maybe it depends on how you hold the brush when you style your hair? I don&#x27;t know, but when I pull a section over the brush, that part is pointing away from my face and never comes in contact with my hair or skin.The high setting blows the hair off the brush, so I usually wait until my hair is about 90% dry and then use the brush on low. My hair is really thick, kind of coarse and just past shoulder length so it takes forever to dry, even at 90% air dried. This doesn&#x27;t really cut down my drying/styling time but at least it&#x27;s not as cumbersome as my dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use this, I section and clip my hair and pull 1-2 inch sections over the brush at a time. I use my other hand to hold the hair over the brush to smooth and direct it and I don&#x27;t even notice the heat coming through the brush. I love, love, love the smooth style that it creates! I could never achieve such results with my old hairdryer and round brush - the back of my head always ended up looking like a rat&#x27;s nest and then I&#x27;d have to go over it with a flat iron to make it look even halfway decent. This is so much easier and I haven&#x27;t used my flat iron since I&#x27;ve gotten it. I haven&#x27;t used the smaller brush that comes with it, so I can&#x27;t speak to that. I did have trouble figuring out how to line up and change the attachments, which took some getting used to. I felt so dumb because my husband could do it effortlessly, but when I tried I couldn&#x27;t seem to line it up right. I finally got the hang of it and  that&#x27;s my only gripe. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> this is not what I expected when it arrived, but I really do like it. My hair is medium length, and it&#x27;s great for days I want a smoother look. does not make curls, but some waviness.</li>
    <li> I used this product for several months. I have fine, thin hair.  It dried it.  It did give it some lift.  But, it also broke my hair.  Not a fan.</li>
    <li> I replaced a similar dryer/styler, that one lasted 10 years. I am not confident this will. The first one shipped to me broken, the top kept falling off so the bristles would slide off the top. The replacement had some sort of short, when the wire would turn in a certain direction it would go off. The 3rd seems to be okay, so far. Amazon was great and shipped the replacements very quickly.</li>
    <li> The attachments were difficult to switch out. The unit had poor heating temperature and took too long to heat.  Defective maybe?!</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these I&#x27;ve had. The first one lasted several years, 5 plus without any problems. This one works even better. Makes it really easy to tame my extra curly hair.</li>
    <li> I like this brush, but it is rather on a cheap side - not very powerfull air flow. On high it just burns your hair beause it just increases the temperature of the blowing out air, not the power of the air flow like some more expensive models do. So I use it on low when my hair is practically dry to just shape my hair.</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Very happy with all four of my products!!</li>
    <li> This is a new version which is supposedly better for your hair but it does not create the same curl. The plastic bristles disbursed amongst brush like bristles easily break and start to catch at your hair. I want the old version back -which was all brush bristle and no plastic</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days, but it has already made a huge difference in my hair. My hair is medium length. It&#x27;s softer and keeps the loose body and curl all day long. It doesn&#x27;t go flat at all. The barrel gets a little hot after it&#x27;s been on for a few minutes, so you probably don&#x27;t want to touch that part directly. And, my hair dries faster with this than it did with the traditional blow dryer.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair (kinky, curly, thick, sometimes unruly).&lt;br /&gt;This blow dryer allows me to blowdry my hair straight to the roots of my scalp so I&#x27;ll use less heat when flat ironing my hair. Be careful not to touch the actual ceramic, it gets really hot!! My friends are always trying to borrow it from me but I don&#x27;t really share. However, I will blowdry other people&#x27;s hair, just to make sure its used properly! I had my first one for about 3 years until a power surge killed it. Thank God for amazon because the place I originally found it (CVS) no longer has this specific kind!&lt;br /&gt;-How I use it-&lt;br /&gt;1. After washing hair, separate into multiple midsize sections. Detangle &amp; knot them. (Knotting them helps to keep them wet enough to get your hair easily through.)&lt;br /&gt;2.Going through one section at a time using the blue attachment until straight and dry.</li>
    <li> It is very hard to use especially if you have longer hair like I do. It&#x27;s very heavy and VERY loud and it dries out my hands and nails. It does get very hot on high. It is also kind of bulky and hard to use.</li>
    <li> I like the design of this hair dryer.  The title doesn&#x27;t do justice for it because some might get confused with it being called an Air Brush.  it has only been used for straightening hair but I imagine it would work well as a regular hair dryer.  I would definately recommend this to ladies that like changing their hairstyles frequently.</li>
    <li> The big brush is too hard and hurts me sometimes. The small brush is very small to my hair. I have long hair. But it works ok.</li>
    <li> This Conair Ionic Hot Air Brush came in a plastic bag with a hand-written product id on a 3&amp;#34; x 5&amp;#34; card inside.  It had obviously been used and returned because there were hairs on both brushes!  I never even plugged it in.  Be careful when ordering; make sure you are getting a NEW product in an UNOPENED box with a manufacturer&#x27;s warranty inside.  Returned this item pronto.</li>
    <li> Hard to control, hair tangles in brush, gets very hot. Did not like this product. Would never recommend it to my friends. .</li>
    <li> Works beautiful and easy to use. The only think I am still getting use to is the on off switch. It is so easy to slid, I have turned it up when I don&#x27;t want to or have turned it off. But it works great!</li>
    <li> For the price of this I expected more.  It&#x27;s hard to handle and the ends keep coming off.  I&#x27;ve let my two girls try it and they didn&#x27;t like it either.</li>
    <li> This is a great product as it replaces having to use the hair dryer and styling brush and being coordinated. I wish I would have had this when I broke my shoulder and couldn&#x27;t use one arm. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I gave one of these away in a Christmas exchange!  We had to give something that we could not live without!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this hot air brush works great. Adds lots of volume to my hair. It has 1000 watts of power so it dries quick. I end up using the lower setting most of the time which is more than enough for my short hair.  I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to a conventional blow dryer ever again!</li>
    <li> Well, I don&#x27;t love it but the person I gifted it to loves it.</li>
    <li> I came across this item on Amazon after doing a search for the infomercial-touted Perfector Fusion Styler, which costs $100.  I cannot afford to spend $100 on a hair styler so was pleased to see that the Conair Air Brush was more in line with my budget.  After reading reviews of the Air Brush here on Amazon and seeing that most reviewers were happy with their purchase (and that most reviews of the Perfector Fusion Styler were negative), I decided to give it a shot ... and i am so glad I did!!!  I have course curly/wavy hair that tends to frizz, especially after just washing and blow drying it - UGH! But with this new Air Brush, my hair is easily styled and managed with NO FRIZZ - it is actually smooth &amp; silky with a little swing - even thicker!! after using the IONIC CERAMIC attachment and it stays that way for a couple of days.  If i need a touch-up, just a few strokes through my hair and it&#x27;s back to looking great! The other brush attachment really does a good finishing job, leaving my hair shiny-looking and soft. I have sent Before &amp; After pics of my hair to my sister &amp; daughter, encourgaging them to buy one for themselves. They can&#x27;t believe the difference, but it is 100% true!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cons i can think of are yes - the on/off switch is awkardly placed on the styler, but if you hold it further back along the handle, you will not turn it off while you are using it.  Also, it would be so awesome if they included a Cold Shot choice to lock in the shine and style.  I keep my old hair dryer on hand so i can pull it out and do the cold shot, otherwise the Conair Air Brush has replaced my hair dryer and flat iron.  I am very happy with this styler and my hair looks great all the time now!</li>
    <li> I am on a quest for a hot air brush that works well on short hair.  This brush looked promising because it came with two different sized brushes.  Unfortunately the large brush was too big to effectively curl around my short hair.  The small brush was the correct size but it was too soft to grab my hair.</li>
    <li> I always wonder how people make their hair look so good all the time, then I find this product in amazon and yes .. it worth all the good feedbacks it received. It is very user-friendly, letting your hair shiny and smooth.</li>
    <li> Works well if you aren&#x27;t trying to do any fancy or highly curled styles. It does smooth my hair out nicely and would work well as a straightener for my daughter&#x27;s very curly hair, I suspect. I will probably send it to her as it doesn&#x27;t really curl my hair as I expected it to do. But for the price I&#x27;m satisfied with it and would recommend it to someone who wants to straighten overly curly hair but leave the bounce, or someone who wants to smooth frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I got this thinking i could spend less time styling my hair but unfortunately didn&#x27;t work for me :( You have to spend a lot time blow drying your hair with this and you may need to use your curly iron or your straightener afterwards to get some style,is so time consuming...I guess is good if you have non frizzy hair,so it all depends on the texture of your hair,I have very frizzy,porous, thick hair and it did not work for me so I had to return it,btw it was the first time I had to return an item from amazon and I was surprise on how easy it was :)</li>
    <li> My rotating brush died amd i ordered this instead, it does not rotate, but it&#x27;s instead really easy to handle, it makes me jaw length bob really full and my daughter&#x27;s long hair look like it was blown out!  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is great for curling and drying and styling.  What more could I ask for?  Thank you so very much.</li>
    <li> and in perfect condition.  I am still learning how to use it, but so far I really like the dryer. It is a little heavier that I thought, but other than that, no complaints!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to hold onto, just too big in circumference to roll in you hand.  I think it would work better for someone who wanted to straighten some of their curl or manage frizz..it seemed to make my hair soft and shiny though.  I have thick, but fine, very straight hair and it really will not curl my hair, only put a flip on the ends.  The pieces are too hot to handle when you&#x27;re using it to change them out, so it makes it difficult to style different lengths for different curl.</li>
    <li> I forgot my hairdryer on one trip to my mother in law&#x27;s house. She had one of these so I gave it a try. I had never thought of using a hairdryer like this, but it was much easier than trying to manage a round brush and a hairdryer at the same time. I don&#x27;t think I would have bought this if I had not tried it first, but I have had this for a few months and I could not imagine getting ready without it.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this hot air brush, says it&#x27;s one of the best she has ever owned, fast shipping thank you</li>
    <li> AWESOME PRODUCT.  I HAVE RECOMMENDED TO MY DAUGHTER AND HER FRIENDS.  WILL KEEP ON DOING SO.  THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH CONAIR</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a Vidal Sassoon dryer brush which gives great curl, but not as much smoothness as I&#x27;d like. I have thick, wavy, somewhat coarse, shoulder length hair, so I thought I&#x27;d try something with ionization. The Conair product gives extremely good results with the smoothness, silkiness, and shine, but virtually no curl whatsoever. The brush seems too large, though my old one was only 1/4 inch smaller. The smaller brush grips the hair a but more, but still doesn&#x27;t give much curl. So, if you want smoothness this works great. If you want shape and curl, keep looking.</li>
    <li> I just call it the MAGICK blow drier! Can&#x27;t live without it! Or else I wouldn&#x27;t look so presentable! After I use it the compliments rain in! Just love it!</li>
    <li> I use to have long hair and used a blower curler brush all of the time.  I now have short hair and I wanted to find something that would work on it.  This foots the bill.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of length, but with the 2 size brushes, it is great for people with long hair as well as short hair.  Glad I found it!</li>
    <li> Great seller, and it works good.</li>
    <li> My wife chose this product based upon her hairdresser&#x27;s recommendation and loves it.</li>
    <li> It is the third time I get one of this. I love how my hair looks. I use it both as a dryer and brush.</li>
    <li> I bought this styler to get the 3/4\\&quot; brush.  It \\&quot;works\\&quot;  fine,  but I find it way too difficult to use.     Pros: It&#x27;s got plenty of power and gets hot.  It&#x27;s got so much power it might blow your hair off the brush with the high setting.      Cons: The brushes on the 3/4\\&quot; brush are too long.  There&#x27;s no quick release, so by the time you get it out of your hair, it can be pulled straight. I cut the brushes down with a scissors and that helped.       The barrel  is way to big for the average female to hold in her hand - the fatter part is a full 2\\&quot; in diameter and the thinner part is over 1.5\\&quot; in diameter.  I have big hands and even I can barely rotate it to wrap my hair. Before you buy this thing, try holding a piece of 1 1/4\\&quot; PVC pipe in your hand and pretend it&#x27;s a curling iron.  Then, the switch is on the handle and it&#x27;s  a slider, so while trying to rotate the big barrel in my hand, I kept turning the thing off.      This might be OK for heavy, smooth hair, but lighterweight hair just blows around too much.</li>
    <li> This is the third one I&#x27;ve bought in about 10 years - it is getting harder to find this - and can&#x27;t find in stores (may have been replaced by a newer model).  The dryer gives my fine hair volume with the larger brush.  The other two that have failed have failed on the lower speed, which is the speed I use to dry my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this new hair appliance in my life!  It makes doing my hair much easier, and I do think my hair is smoother.  A friend of mine recommended this brush and I am glad I followed up on it.</li>
    <li> This was an epic waste of my college money. For me, that is. I read all the amazing reviews of how it made hair shiny and smooth, etc. Well, that didn&#x27;t happen at all for me-- my hair was poofy and frizzy. When I rolled it up to try and curl my hair under, I had a terrible time getting it unrolled without pulling my hair. It works GREAT for straightening your hair while blow drying, but don&#x27;t think it will curl your hair. You just end up straightening your hair when you pull it out of your hair. Oh, and it&#x27;s super noisy. When I turned it off from using the \\&quot;HIGH\\&quot; setting I had a ringing in my ears...didn&#x27;t really like that. Quite possibly this is because my hair is thick, naturally wavy, and frizzy. I wanted to chuck this thing out the window after I saw what it did to my hair...the same thing i could do with a brush and a blow dryer without spending $21.99. I gave this three stars because I&#x27;m sure it works for people with straight, thin hair.     p.s. The switch IS in a bad spot...</li>
    <li> Love it! It makes styling my hair so easy, just like when I go to my hairdresser&lt;br /&gt; Makes me feel like a pro</li>
    <li> This hot air brush is OK. Not what it is cracked up to be. If you want just a hot air curler for your hair, then it is not for you. If you want something you can just run through your hair to dry it and make it straight, then  it is for you. I wish I had never wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered and received this product and I have used it once so far. Based on that, I absolutely love it. My hair is relatively short so the 1-1/4&amp;#34; attachment is too big but the 3/4&amp;#34; one works perfectly with my hair length. I previously read some posts about getting burned and also about accidently shutting it off while using it but I had no problems with either of those things. The trick to not shutting it off is to hold it below the switch and that won&#x27;t happen. So far I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I use this instead of a blow dryer now. I don&#x27;t know if that was its intention or not but the wand is very useable and adds body to my thin hair. But the hint is not to use too much product. If you do it takes forever to dry your hair and it comes out crunchy. Each attachment works as it should and I just like this soooo much more than a blow dryer. It drys fast and bouncy-at least for me. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love how the tourmaline really does eliminate static in my hair. I only wish it didn&#x27;t have the boar bristles on the wide brush. I would give it 5 stars if the larger brush had all plastic bristles.</li>
    <li> this one I lasted three months. not recommend . hairdryer is my least lasted in life. I have had many and never had one that lasts as little as this</li>
    <li> Not at all what I expected.  Very loud. Too hot to touch so trying to curl your hair is impossible. I don&#x27;t notice any less frizz either so the ions don&#x27;t make a difference. Save your money.</li>
    <li> This does an ok job with my curly/frizzy hair. Maybe I tried a different product it might be better. My hair starts out smoother but starts to frizz. I can&#x27;t complain about the price versus other stylers.</li>
    <li> I got this to straighten out wild, unruly curls and it does the job well. Having the blower and brush as one unit leaves your other hand free to hold a mirror and see what you&#x27;re doing in the back of your head. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love the shape of this hairdryer!  I wear a short bob, and this dryer works perfectly to turn the ends of my hair under and fluff up the top and sides of my hair.  The only flaw I have found in this type of dryer is that after time the low won&#x27;t work on the switch.  Keep hoping they fix this flaw.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s OK. Personally I prefer the 1500.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t curl my hair to save my life.  The curling iron always left clamp marks, and I never figured out the trick to curling with a straightening iron, and just burned myself.  This product makes it soooooo easy!! It&#x27;s literally like just brushing your hair with a round brush.  Adds lots of volume and smoothness too!&lt;br /&gt;Got this at bed Beth and beyond with a coupon- great deal!&lt;br /&gt;Only con is that I found the differnt brush heads were hard to change out.  It&#x27;s possible- just very tight!</li>
    <li> Over 10 years ago, I purchased several Conair 1000 watt hot air brushes with the non-tangle brush head.  Then I was no longer able to find that model so I kept buying other hot air brushes, trying to find something that would work as well.  Finally I found this brush and my hair looks soooo much better. It works really well on thick, coarse hair.</li>
    <li> Love this hot air brush! It is the second one I have purchased for myself and I use it daily. I have slightly curly hair so it helps with styling my hair. The only reason I had to buy a second one is because after over 10 years of using the first one the cord gave out on me. Probably my fault for storing it poorly. I expect to have this one for at least another 10 years!</li>
    <li> I recently tried everything to straighten my frizzy, over-processed, curly hair without the use of a flat iron or blow dryer.  I tried drying it naturally with big rollers and it took way too long and didn&#x27;t come out straight enough for it to look polished.  I tried this product because it advertised that ionics cut down on the frizzies and I LOVE it!  I wash my hair and use the straight attachment for my bangs only and then let my hair dry naturally till it&#x27;s almost dry.  Then I whip out this fantastic air brush and style it.  It takes very little time and it looks beautiful!  The brush works out great for giving a lift at the top and straightens the rest!  I put the setting on low and I feel that it does no damage to my hair and IONICS WORK!  My hair is less frizzy and stays less frizzy in humid weather!.  (If I know it&#x27;s going to be humid, I use a bit of anti-frizz serum before drying).  I agree that Conair should move their controls which sometimes get switched while stying, but other than that, I LOVE THIS IONIC BRUSH and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!</li>
    <li> This tool gets so hot, even on low, it is dangerous.  I am afraid it will set my hair or my house on fire.  There is no way to lay it down to section your hair out.  The problem of extreme heat is where the brush meets the handle.  That comes in contact with my hair, shoulder length, and my counter.  The first time I used it I did not have it on secure and it feel off in my bathroom floor.  I thought it was going to burn the floor but I could not even pick the brush end up!  All I can say is Conair has made a very dangerous device.  It should be removed from the market.  Yes, it dries in record time but I will not use it again.  The couple of times I did use it, it is a two person job...someone has to hold the brush as it comes with no stand.  Help us conair!uu</li>
    <li> This item made my hair frizzy with and without product. It also tangled my hair. Does not work as well as a flat iron!</li>
    <li> Love this blow dryer and the attachments.  Dries really fast.  Love the brushes.  Very powerful and not as noisy as some other dryers.</li>
    <li> Quit working after a short time</li>
    <li> It is nice one and we love it......very easy to use and it is very.....one of the best with one</li>
    <li> Purchased to use while recovering from broken elbow. Styling with one hand was diificult. This dryer made it so much easier. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> This product came to complete my team embellishment. is practical, I can carry it in a small space and anywhere. temperature and the good works with low voltage. Combing my hair with shine .... I like!</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush for a 16 year old for her Birthday.  She was so excited she &amp;#34;tried&amp;#34; to use it immediately, this was a disaster!!!  Firstly the brush handle is so large and heavy that she couldn&#x27;t even hold it without holding the end of the brush.  Because of this the brush, which by the way gets very very hot,  burned her cheek, that&#x27;s a travesty for a 16 year old girl.  This of course ruined her Birthday.&lt;br /&gt;I read that there were alot of good reviews which is why I ordered it but before you order remember that the handle is very large and the brushes are very difficult to remove from the base.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this to anybody especially someone with small hands.</li>
    <li> There is a design flaw with this model - there is a simple plastic band that holds the button that engages the brush attachment.  The band cracked within 2 months of using this - only every 2-3 days tops - and now the brush falls out and I can no longer use this.  I also can&#x27;t get a refund through Amazon because of the 30-day return policy, and through Conair, they require me to return it at my own cost, which, for $20, not sure I&#x27;ll do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conair says &amp;#34;they&#x27;ve never heard of this before,&amp;#34; but given that this is a cheaply-made product from China, I&#x27;m highly doubting that.  It&#x27;s a shame too, because I thought I had found the perfect tool - I have curly, coarse in some parts - hair - that was going flat and frizzy with other dryers, and this created smooth curls almost effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried 2 Revlon hot air brushes since, and the brushes on them don&#x27;t work, and they have other issues as well.  I really liked this one, but don&#x27;t feel like taking a chance with it breaking again, so I&#x27;m still searching for better brands with a similar brush like the blue one, and still ionic...if anyone has any ideas, feel free to respond.</li>
    <li> Bought it for christmas for my SO. She was thrilled with it and uses it every day. Great quality, amazing price, quick shipping. Would do business again.</li>
    <li> Sheesh, some of those negative reviews were almost funny!  Mine may not be this newest version, but my only possible complaint about the handle would be that the switch does sit right by your thumb, so I&#x27;ve been known to turn it off or to low without meaning to, but it&#x27;s certainly not as big as some are complaining about.  My teenage daughter has no problem using it!  This thing is a LIFESAVER!  I had bushy, frizzy, difficult hair for years - which is a horrible way to get thru your teen years, but this brush really tames it - better than any other &#x27;brush&#x27; &amp; dryer combo I&#x27;ve ever used!  The key is the attachment that has TWO kinds of bristles, hard plastic AND soft bristles, which make it glide thru your hair easier than some that have only soft bristles that get all tangled in your hair, which is why I cannot understand why others are complaining about it - unless their hair is so long it would be a problem for any brush.  My hair is shoulder length &amp; I don&#x27;t have a problem with it getting stuck in this brush at all!  I would be LOST if they ever stopped making this brush!  NOTHING works as well to tame my unruly hair!  This gives my hair body, &amp; smoothes it so it looks &amp; feels normal!  But, don&#x27;t use this on sopping wet hair, I give it a quick dry first - sometimes with just a cold setting, then I really only have to use this Conair brush on the top layer, so it&#x27;s less stress on the hair!  It&#x27;s a win/win!</li>
    <li> Delivery was quick.  Item was wrapped to perfection.  The item was brand new in the original package.  I have not used it yet.  i will post another review after the first use.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it very often, but it was as advertized.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who is 10 and wanted to dry and style her own hair. She still can&#x27;t properly maneuver a regular curling iron, but is able to create a great style with this hot air brush. She has long, semi-wavy hair and this works great - and gives her independence without the burns on her hands, head, and ears.</li>
    <li> Less power and heat than regular blow dryers but easy to use. Really does seem to help frizzies. Seems sturdy.</li>
    <li> I have purchased Conair products in the past and loved the way they work in my very thick and long, natural curly hair. This product is the exception to that love. Both brush styles cause my hair to get tangled in the bristles, making it very difficult to style and dry the hair. The last Conair Hot Air Brush I owned had the unique tool to curl the ends of my hair around the bristle and then I would hit this &amp;#34;release&amp;#34; button and the brush would unravel my hair by spinning in the opposite direction that I curled my hair.  This ingenious tool eliminated hair pulling and breakage.  Too bad this product does not have this tool. All I get is pain and grief when using this product. My hair also frizzes up right away after using this product. The Ceramic Ionic plates do not seem to be doing an effective job on my hair if I getting frizzy hair right after using the product. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I got this hot air brush as a lightning deal on black friday week for 16.99. I was a little weary when buying it, because i have bought many products like this before and had little to no results. But I figured that it was a good price, so why not. After using it for the first time I was very happy! It made my thick, frizzy hair turn into beautiful smooth silky locks! I agree with other reviews about the on off switch (that is the only reason I rated it 4 out of 5), but I don&#x27;t feel that having to switch it back on every once in a while is a deal breaker.     I am also not a person to spend a lot of time on my hair in the morning, since I usually have to be to work WAY to early to care. But with this product I can get in shower, style my hair, and out the door in a little over a half hour (and I tend to take long showers!)     If I would of know how great this would make my hair look, I would have bought it a while ago, and wouldn&#x27;t even think twice about paying full price for it!</li>
    <li> When the brush attachment on my more than 10-year old Conair Hot Air Brush began to disintigrate, I looked to see what new model Conair had available.  The Conair Ceramic Ionic Hot Air Brush incorporated the newer ceramic and ionic technologies while still retaining the desirable features of its predacessor.  After determining that replacing the brushes would cost more than a new Conair Ceramic Ionic Hot Air Brush from Amazon, I decided to purchase an entire new unit.  Amazon&#x27;s price is far and away the best on the web and beats local retailers by at least $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Conair Ceramic Ionic Hot Air Brush is ideal for finishing many hairstyles.  While its 1000 watt power makes it impractical as one&#x27;s only drying tool for longer hair, it does a fine job on shorter, cropped styles.  As someone with chin-length hair, I find my Infiniti by Conair SD8 Tourmaline Ceramic Styler provides the power I need to do the initial drying phase of my style.  However, my hair is somewhat boxed in the back and has a tendency to flip upward no matter what I do.  The brush on the Infiniti by Conair SD8 Tourmaline Ceramic Styler has proven to be a bit large to handle my hair&#x27;s length in the back in styling the turn-under.  The Conair Hot Air Brush, on the other hand, is just what I needed for producing a lovely, slightly turned under curve.  It is compact enough to handle the finish work on the rest of my hair without a problem.  This allows me to get a nice straight look without subjecting my hair, on a daily basis, to the intense heat of a flat iron.  The new ceramic and ionic features do impart additional shine to my hair and seem to cut down on the fly-away strays I have.  The brush has not burned my hair which I color about every four weeks using Clairol&#x27;s Natural Instincts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The diameter of this hot air brush&#x27;s handle portion has been reduced a bit from its former iterations.  I have small hands and have no problems holding or manipulating the brush.  This is particularly important as I am dealing with a non-functional left-hand and must be able to style my hair with only one hand.  The tools are fairly easy to put on and remove, even with one hand; this may be because Conair is still using the same system that was used on my older Conair hot air brush.  The on-off switch operates smoothly and is much easier to move than the switch on my older model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Conair Ceramic Ionic Hot Air Brush is easy to pack for travel as the pieces are sufficiently compact so the fit into the \\&quot;dead spaces\\&quot; between clothing and other necessities packed in your carryon or checked baggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not regret purchasing the Ceramic Ionic Hot Air Brush - it is quite functional and does an excellent job as a styling tool.  I fully expect it will be as long lasting as my last Conair hot air brush.as I am dealing with a non-functional left-hand and must be able to style my hair with only one hand.

    <li> The heat and blow is great (a lot of power for a cheap product). It&#x27;s easy to use. I wish the cord was longer. It can get a little overheated at times when used too long and I wish there were a cool setting, too. It is pretty loud for a small dryer, a lot of hair dryers have been able to modify the volume down these days, so, that&#x27;s another con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With long hair, it&#x27;s easy to get it tangled in the brushes. You have to learn how to work with it to get what you want out of it. I think it&#x27;d be much more ideal for short to even medium (shoulder length hair); but I have to do a drawn out roll up-dry-unroll halfway-dry-unroll some more THEN I can rotate it while I dry the last 1/4 to get a little flip in order to use it. Or else I get a tangled mess. It needs a MUCH bigger barrel to work with long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does add some shine, which is great-something I was looking for out of the product with the brushes. However, I&#x27;ve found it also adds a lot of static to my hair. So.. Honestly, I&#x27;m thinking you get what you pay for with this kind of thing. It&#x27;ll do for now but I&#x27;m going to be on the lookout for something of more quality.</li>
    <li> This product is not for me :(  The tools get very hot and when I ordered it I thought that the brush spun. I&#x27;ve put it away for now.</li>
    <li> Its not bad, definitely does what its supposed to do! My daughter likes it very much!</li>
    <li> OK, I have very thick and pseudo long hair.  I didn&#x27;t think this would really work on my hair, but boy was I wrong!  I&#x27;ve used it twice now, and am just amazed at how much nicer and less frizzy my hair is with this product. I look like I just got out of the salon!  It can be a bit difficult to get all my hair done, and it does get stuck in their sometimes too, but nothing I can&#x27;t handle when you get results like these. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These tend to flake out after a few months of use, but I still haven&#x27;t found a better product to do the job.  Gets my hair nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  I have been using this brush for twenty years.  I even take it to Europe when I go and find a converter.  It makes styling my hair very easy as it is all in one piece.</li>
    <li> I should have bought it long time ago</li>
    <li> I love this whole set it really works really great, I&#x27;m letting my hair grow out some for the very find time in about twenty five years, and I wanted to be able to curl my hair this work&#x27;s great, and the curls stay in, and you can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
    <li> Love it! I have curly, chin length hair that goes limp in winter. My hairdresser blew out the curls and it looked great. Never thought I could do it, but with this hot air brush it was so easy!! I&#x27;m quite arthritic but  find this very quick/easy and my arms didn&#x27;t tire. I also like that this product has 2 brush sizes and a diffuser making it a multitasker. BEWARE, let brush cool before separating it from the base as it gets very hot. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this to straighten my hair. My hair is about chin length and I don&#x27;t want to burn myself with a curler. This works great.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this hot air brush! I have a chin length layered bob with bangs. The first time I used it, I got lots of volume, but the overall style didn&#x27;t look that great. I figured it would take time to learn how to use it, though. Today, my second time using it, my hair turned out great!!! My co-worker thought I had gone to the salon before work! The hot air brush gives TONS of volume and it lasts! I did my hair at 9 am this morning and it still looks great 10 hours later. My hair is soft, shiny, and even looks thicker. Also, hardly any frizz, although it is very dry in my area today. Another plus, the section of hair that always flips up instead of staying straight or curled under is.... yes, staying straight! I am very happy with my purchase!!! Much better styling results than I get using a blow dryer and round brush. It does take a little practice to get used to using it, but it&#x27;s worth the effort IMO. A couple of tips: let your hair air dry partially or dry it halfway with the nozzle attachment, then switch to the brush. I used Big Sexy Hair Volumizing Blow Dry Gel and Sebastian Shaper Plus Hairspray.</li>
    <li> This is my first hot air brush so I can&#x27;t really compare it to any others, but so far I like it!  When I first started using it, I had friends ask me if I had my hair professionally done that day. It definitely gives the look of a blow out, but is much easier to use than a separate blow dryer and brush AND is much much cheaper than going to a salon. My one gripe with this product is that the cord is way too short. If the outlet you plan on using is located near the floor and you want to use the hot air brush while standing up, it&#x27;s highly likely that the cord will not be long enough for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;My hot air brush just died without any warning. I went to use it one day and it stopped blowing hot air. It still turns on, but now it blows room temperature air. I&#x27;m sad to see it go. It lasted me 2 years of daily use. I&#x27;m not sure how long these type of things typically last, but I definitely feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> Worthless for my needs.</li>
    <li> Love these - have been using them for years.  Sorry I cannot buy it locally.</li>
    <li> Works great on my hair and does not damage my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this item expecting to use it as a curling device for my hair. It frizzed my hair and added not curls. Stay away from this one!</li>
    <li> This item is probably good for some people, however, I have much better results drying my medium fine hair with a blow dryer and round brush, I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> Did not like this hot air brush at all, it was returned. Not the wattage stated, my husband measured it with his meter.  Brush does not turn and release, so if your not careful your hair tangles up easily.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product. Works as advertised and not too hard to master.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair styling tool I have EVER used. Yes EVER.&lt;br /&gt;It has taken my hair drying time down to at least half of what it was. I have very thick and a lot of this thick hair and its long.&lt;br /&gt;Naturally it will take about 4- 6 hours to dry. With a regular blow dryer, it would take close to an hour. Then I would still have to flat iron to get the straightness I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;With this, I let it air dry a little - then section it off, starting at the bottom and dry. Whole head takes 20-30 minutes to totally dry....AND it is very straight and smooth and I don&#x27;t actually have to do anything to it again for up to 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;Its revolutionary for me that I can dry it that quickly and have it be that smooth and look that nice. IN LOVE WITH THIS PRODUCT&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;Have been so happy with it, I haven&#x27;t tried using the smaller brushes to curl yet.</li>
    <li> I tried multiple times to style my hair with this product, and all it did was make my hair frizzy.</li>
    <li> I bought this hot air brush to replace one I had for almost 15 years.  The old one still works, but because I dropped it (more than once) the plastic button that clips the brush in place cracked.  I discovered that my old hard bristle brush works in the new one too!  This has been the perfect tool for drying my very thick, heavy hair.</li>
    <li> Like a blow dryer, curling iron, and boar bristle brush in one.  I needed a new blow dryer, and I am so happy I took a chance on something different.  My chin-length hair doesn&#x27;t ever get tangled.</li>
    <li> I usually buy one a year.</li>
    <li> Excellent and prompt service by this seller. Item as advertised. I would recommend this person to anyone looking for great quality and exceptional customer service!</li>
    <li> I read that ionic brushes do wonderful things for one&#x27;s hair, so I decided to try this dryer.  I am pleased with it.  My hair is very short, so it&#x27;s hard to tell if it is improved, but this appliance helps me style it very nicely.  It is easy to use and does a nice job.</li>
    <li> I was very exited to have all my styling tools in one, but my excitement quickly faded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll start with the Pro: there are two speeds and the high is really hot which is good when using it as a dryer. However, when using the brush, it&#x27;s too hot. It is a dryer and has two brushes for volume or curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The attachments get so hot you can&#x27;t just change them as needed, you need to wait for them to cool off. (I don&#x27;t have time to leisurely wait.) The bristles on the larger brush (which is the only one I use) do not grip the hair which does not give volume or a good finish. The attachments are very difficult to take off and on. This is my second one and the smaller brush still does not fit the base as it should; the cut out on the brush is too small for the handle to fit and lock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had purchased another Conair air brush which I loved and used this one solely for the dryer since I don&#x27;t need a big dryer for my hair. That worked perfectly until the other unit died, leaving me to deal with only this one. I finally found that if I use the big brush on the low heat setting I can get a somewhat decent style which will have to do until I can purchase another unit.</li>
    <li> Pieces didn&#x27;t fit well--too tight.</li>
    <li> This is like a dream come true. It was easy to use and made my hair look absolutely incredible! I would definitely recommend this tool!</li>
    <li> Sorry for the low rating, but I cannot use this product as it is built.  The larger brush has bristles, which I thought would be a great idea since many of the old bushes were made from boar bristles and they were great.  Such is not the case with this device.  The bristles actually keep the hair from getting close to the ceramic area where the curling occurs.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My hair is shoulder length and I was skeptical about this hot air brush. I have to say that it is a real time saver and does a great job at giving my hair volume and style. As someone who used to flat iron quite a bit, I have to say my hair has been healthier using this product as well. As long as you have a good thermal leave-in treatment for your hair, this hot air brush does a great job! My one and only (picky) concern is that I wish the cord was at least another foot longer so I can comfortably style the back of my hair instead of having to nearly sit on the sink so it will reach.</li>
    <li> Love my air brush!  Dries my very thick hair in minutes.</li>
    <li> This is my third Conair Hot Brush. I really like that I can dry, straighten and curl my hair at the same time. My first one, lasted the longest, until the motor gave out. The second one...I dropped, cracking where the attachment(s) connect &amp; lock in place. This eventually lead to my recent, third, being purchased. Where the attachments connect is very tight and harder to maneuver, but I really like this product so will deal with this snug fit.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly.  I&#x27;m recovering from shoulder surgery so I can&#x27;t use my hairdryer and brush as I normally would.  This has made drying and styling my hair - one handed - so much easier.  The air flow is strong, the heat is very good.  I purchased one prior to ordering this but had to return it because the airflow was too weak and the heat just wasn&#x27;t what I wanted.  This does everything I need.</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy hair that tends to frizz. I used to be all thumbs when it came to using a round brush and blower dryer to style my hair. This hot air brush helps me to dry, smooth and style my hair with ease. The high setting and larger brush work best for my hair.</li>
    <li> I have had my hot air brush for a little over a week. I have short hair but a lot of it. It&#x27;s color treated. It is also unpredictable. I&#x27;m not a big fan of the hair dryer and brush method so I began my search for an alternative. The first time I used it, I liked it. Through days of experimenting I found that tipping my head over gives me the best result. I&#x27;ve read reviews that state that we should not use this tool on wet hair, we should wait until it&#x27;s damp. Well, I tried it both ways and wet works best for me. I love the way my hair looks when I use this tool....shiny, full....not poker straight...I don&#x27;t want straight hair. I have a natural wave to my hair and this tool enhances it. I tip my head over toward the front and work the heated brush through my hair and pick the brush through my hair....One word of caution....This tool gets very hot. I can&#x27;t touch it to change the attachments without a towel over my hand. I have no problem with the location of the buttons. If it shuts off, I turn it back on. Not a biggie. Even without the attachments, this tool is a great lightweight hair dryer.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT---It fell apart! I still use it as a hairdryer but I will not re-purchase because it is so fragile. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> So very disappointed in this ceramic hot air brush. The brush attachments were almost impossible to attach. It seemed like the attachments were a bit too small for the brush base. I had to ask my husband to help in getting the attachments on and secured. He had difficulty as well so he used a bit of hand soap on the brush base to try to get the attachments on. That made it easier but not by much. I won&#x27;t be sending the brush back since there is hand soap on it. I&#x27;ve used Conair products in the past and never had any problems with them. As for my review of how the brush performed - it worked fairly well once the brush attachment was secured. The problem for me will be the struggle to secure the attachment any time I want to use the brush.</li>
    <li> At first, I loved this brush because I only needed one hand to dry/style my short hair. But after a few months, the brush became extremely hot after only 1 minute into my styling session. Since I have fine hair that dries out quickly, I had to shut the brush off after only a minute or so of styling. That, of course, left my hair barely half-finished. I hate to throw out a product that still works, but I think that at this point it&#x27;s doing my hair more harm than good. I&#x27;ll look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, straight hair and even the low setting blows my hair off of the brush and makes it frizzy.  This brush was also large and awkward. I thought that this would simplify my morning but it is easier to use a blow dryer and a brush.  I will be giving it away.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hot air brush after having two Revlon hot airbrushes that died after a year of use. However, this brush only has one temp setting (compared to Revlon&#x27;s three) and leaves my hair frizzy instead of smooth curls. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> Broke very fats, don&#x27;t last one month, very bad quality</li>
    <li> not what I wanted it to be.I can&#x60;t use it.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this brush, but it is fantastic.  It took a bit longer to dry my hair, but not chance of burning it off.  My hair is fine and thinning as I get older, and it made lots of volume that was noticeable even after sleeping on it all night.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Purchased this item for my wife -- replacement for same model which broke after about 5 years.  Works just fine -- real selling point of this item is a natural brush which is far gentler on the hair than the metallic brushes usually included with hot air brushes.</li>
    <li> For the price, it&#x27;s a good deal. I got one for the gym so I wouldn&#x27;t have to deal with a hairbrush and a blow dryer. It does everything it&#x27;s supposed to, but the handle is very bulky and it the whole thing is a little long overall. Could be more compact, definitely.</li>
    <li> This brush/Dryer leaves your nice &amp; smooth &amp; static free. A must for that problem hair</li>
    <li> Hard to hold, my fingers grip right where the control buttons are, turning it from low to high or even off.  Once I adjust for this, it seems to work fine, giving my hair the shape and body it needs, but it ends up being too time consuming.</li>
    <li> Not what I needed in this product. I have always liked conair devices however this one is not as good for my chemically treated hair. I was hoping for one device to dry and style my hair and this one would tangle the hair when it was damp. I might like this for styling only with longer hair. The blow drying only part is great.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well for my fine hair. Didn&#x27;t create lasting curl and volume and made my hair feel dry.</li>
    <li> I still need a lot of practice, but it does what it is supposed to do. I do have a hard time using it for the back of my head.</li>
    <li> I have never been adept at curling my hair under with a round brush and blow drier.  This is the magical answer! I dry my hair most of the way with my dryer, then use the hot air brush to do the finishing touches. Brilliant!</li>
    <li> great to use for a quick fix up! i use it all the time! i love it! I use it for flips and waves and other different hair styles.</li>
    <li> This product is very convenient and nice. I can now dry my hair in 5-10 mins. I prefer if it has a brush also, it will be perfect (that&#x27;s why I rate it 4 instead of 5). However, its perfect for students and working mothers who need to make their hair without spending too much time.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice unit but for me it is too big for my short hair.  I will keep it and use if as a gift for someone in my family . however that being said  i&#x27;ll probably try it out and then know its great The only thing I thought was it was smaller barel size than the 1.25 size It appears smaller in the pictures.  Could send back but if I do, I&#x27;ll need one the next day.ggg</li>
    <li> This product is beeter than i expected. It gets too hot at times, even set to the lower temperature. But i love it.</li>
    <li> This is my second one. It is very hard to find a styling hairdryer. All I can find in the stores are flat irons right now. My hair is very thick and curly. This brush dries my hair very quickly and is all I need for styling. My hair becomes as straight as I want it with lots of shine and body. My first one lasted about two years - I used it daily. This time I bought two - one for back-up in case they are no longer available when I need it.</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this for her friend&#x27;s birthday.  The following is her experience.&lt;br /&gt;My close friend told me about the hot air brush and how her stylist used it on her hair.  I was so curious about it since I&#x27;ve never heard of it before.  After watching some youtube videos I wanted to buy her and myself one.  My friend has fine, shoulder length hair and she just likes a nice flip on the ends. I thought this Conair barrel size (the large one) would be perfect, not too small and not too large.  The small barrel would be for the top sections of her head and bangs. What&#x27;s great about this Conair too is that it is ionic.  This will automatically help reduce frizz and flyaways and help your hair to look shiny and smooth.  After giving it to her I checked to see how she likes it.  She used it and said that her drying time is about the same as just using regular hair dryer but this way she is styling and gets the flip she wanted.  Overall, she like her hot air brush.  I&#x27;m happy she enjoyed her gift.  I would just add to use a heat protective spray like Tresemme before putting any heat on your hair.  http://www.amazon.com/TRESemme-Thermal-Creations-Tamer-Protective/dp/B000H88QOM/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1424488308&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;heat+protectant+tres+semme</li>
    <li> Have only used this brush intermittently since it&#x27;s initial purchase last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It brings nice volume at the crown but I always have to stop mid-shaft - both brush attachments have a weird design that always add weird square kinks in my hair.  The brush is round but it&#x27;s design is comprised of a row of comb-like bristles then brush like bristles which might not cause an issue for women with very thick hair but mine unfortunately is not - have lots of hair but it is fine.  Like it for its volume capabilities but it always mangles my ends in addition to the lovely comb indentations.  Should have returned it but but was too frustrated from other hair brush dryer fiascos  - one rotating dryer&#x27;s rotating brush would turn on if dryer was tilted, etc. so I kept it - MISTAKE!  Minimal use of this item - maybe 20 times over a yr &amp; this morning it sparked.  Dryer is clean, not clogged, &amp; stored in a minimal dust area.  Of course, it can not be returned. $36 dollars down the drain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, even at $21. save your $s, your hair &amp; most importantly your safety.  Before I replaced it I had a great brush dryer that lasted over 10 years - was a drugstore purchase.  Miss it much!</li>
    <li> The natural bristle part doesn&#x27;t grip my hair without using both hands.  The ceramic attachment grips better, but I haven&#x27;t been able to use it much, because parts of it get so hot that I feel like I&#x27;m going to burn myself.  I&#x27;ve been so frustrated with it, that I rarely use it.</li>
    <li> I will be returning this. I didn&#x27;t even get to use it once. I plugged it in and turned it to &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; to test the air volume. I heard a popping noise and saw a flash (the handle is somewhat translucent where the cord comes out). And that was that. Thankfully, I didn&#x27;t already have it up next to my head.</li>
    <li> Works great! Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> Not very noisy. I use the large brush to turn my hair under. I have bottom-of-the-ear-length hair. It takes a few times to get used to the machine as it feels cumbersome. I often switch it off by mistake. The brush does not get caught in the hair.</li>
    <li> Item was defective in that both brush attachments do not fit onto the blower wand.  The hole size is too small and you cannot force it to fit.  I have the same hot air brush that is about 10 years old and in need of replacement and I was able to use those brush attachments on my new hot air brush.  I would appreciate a replacement or refund but I&#x27;m not interested in spending more time returning the defective item when it belongs in the garbage.</li>
    <li> Yes, it is loud but that didn&#x27;t really bother me.. And yes, the brush did pop off in middle of drying because it just needed to be tightened up. Otherwise it was a spectacular experience. My hair never looked so shiny and sleek, best of all it lasted three days without hairspray.</li>
    <li> This hot air brush does a good job, but it&#x27;s a bit on the heavy side.</li>
    <li> Luckily I had a previously owned Conair Hot Air dryer, because the small brush did not fit the dryer.  The one I had saved, did.  I love the dryer itself, which is why I replaced the previous one which had broken after many uses.  I was disappointed in the product, since I would have been out of luck had I not saved the small brush.</li>
    <li> The on/off button is in the front there my fingers are holding the brush. So it keeps sliding to high or off all the time. I keep having to stop and adjust it. I had an older model which I lost whlie on a trip I liked that one better. Aside from that the heat is OK.</li>
    <li> Horrible product.  Leaves my hair frizzier than it was before.  It&#x27;s almost impossible to keep all the stands while trying to roll it because the vent is blowing it all over the place. I don&#x27;t know how anyone can do it on their own.  You need at least two people to use this product.</li>
    <li> This litte dryer really delivers a good amount of heat! I have loved that it has cut my blow out time down from 45 min- 1 hour (I have super curly hair) to 15-20 minutes. I only use the larger brush for a few reasons. First its the only one with the ionic plates, which really makes a difference.  Secondly, the instruction manual said the larger one was for straightening and the smaller one was to add curl, and since my hair has enough curl on its own, I decided against it. If you have curly hair, this dryer alone will not make your hair pin straight, you will still need to touch up with an iron. I usually don&#x27;t need a flat iron after using this because I like how it looks, but I will use a flat iron the next day just to touch it up. I like the amount of body and volume I am left with after using this product and have gotten a lot of compliments on it. Most people say it looks like I got my hair done at a salon. They can&#x27;t believe I did it myself, and in under 20 minutes. I would buy this product over and over again.</li>
    <li> To date, the best hot air brush I&#x27;ve had.  Bristles are a bit softer than I&#x27;m used to and it took a style or two to adjust my technique.  BUT...great after that.  My hair has Never been fuller and fullness stays until the next washing.  I have very fine hair and fullness is a real challenge.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Was disappointed that the brush was still too large for my hair.  They need to make a brush that is smaller to fit hair that is medium to short and very thin and fine.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before purchasing this Conair hot air brush. Yes, it does turn of easily while using it, but short of making it tighter and more difficult to turn on/off, I&#x27;m not sure how else it could have been designed.It is a minor annoyance, but I can see how someone in a hurry might be aggravated by it. I needed one that had a small diameter brush for my short summer style, and this one had a bonus larger brush. For years I had been buying different sizes according to my needs and giving the previous ones away. I will be able to keep this one for a long time.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair that irons don&#x27;t seem to work on. This brush is magic! It straightens and waves and curls in the way you want your hair to.</li>
    <li> Brush gets tangled up in my hair and even makes square curls instead of round ones &#x3D; brush not large enough&lt;br /&gt;not enough settings, shuts off easily</li>
    <li> Like it a lot. I only gave it 4 stars because I wish it had a smaller brush for shorter hair. Very good product. It is the only one that I found with that much wattage. I had another air brush, but it didn&#x27;t really get hot enough. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Wish they had a larger brush, but it does a great job of styling my long hair. Style lasts all day and still looks good the next morning. I have dark medium course hair and used to use styling gel. With this styling brush I don&#x27;t have to. Love that!</li>
    <li> I have owned several Conair Hot Air Brushes of a similar model, along with a couple of other air brushes from Revlon.  (They tend to go out about every 1 - 2 years, so I buy these often). I even consider myself somewhat of an expert on this type of air brush product, since I&#x27;ve used them to style my hair for the past 10 years or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found some pretty big design flaws in this brush that has lead me to ditch it after a few weeks and buy another.  First, the brushes themselves leave serious creases in my hair.  The ceramic one has plastic teeth that do not allow the hair to smoothly move, causing creases.  The smaller round brush gets tangled easily, which then also results in creases.  I have really never had this problem before with other brushes - even with my long hair!  Second, the on/off switch is located in a very inconvenient place where your thumb rests, and is SO SENSITIVE that I find myself changing the air speed or turning it off each time I move my hand.  Other similar products put the switch more near the bottom, and I&#x27;ve never realized why until I got this brush.  Lastly, the HEAT on this brush is too much.  It means that I cannot use my other hand at all to help guide the brush without getting burned (which is a problem since - see above - the brushes don&#x27;t allow you to work smoothly).  I can only wonder what the high heat is doing to my hair...  (The ions also don&#x27;t seem to do what they should, based on what I&#x27;ve seen from other ionized products.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would NOT recommend this brush.  This does not mean I wouldn&#x27;t recommend another type of Conair or Revlon Air Brush - I love them - but this one is about to go in the trash for me.  I guess the only reason for 2 stars is that it&#x27;s cheap and I can throw it away without too much angst.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer, helps fight freeze</li>
    <li> This is a very powerful tool. It works great on my daughters hair she is mixed. She has very curly yet fine hair. It helps to use the low setting with the smaller brush. The high setting is pretty hot so I keep it on low. Her hair is less frizzy &amp; drys with a shine. I would recommend to anyone who is mixed.</li>
    <li> comes with 2 rollers (plastic fingers/bristles on both) easily switched out and is easy to use. The 2-speed on/off slide switch is awkwardly located where your thumb goes, so is a nuisance to often unintentionally switch to hi-speed while you are using. The interspersed brush bristles are somewhat damaging to hair, especially when really wet, so is better on mostly dried hair for styling rather than drying. Wish one of the rollers was plastic fingers only (without bristles) to save from split ends. However, styles well and good price.</li>
    <li> I am using it every day and it is very good. Conair is a good brand... I recommend it for sure</li>
    <li> This works great, but the brushes are too big for me.  I have fine, shorter hair and would prefer one of the brushes to be a 1&amp;#34;.  The low setting is great, high setting is too hot and noisy for me.  Otherwise it is great and easy to handle.</li>
    <li> I used to be able to pick this curling brush up at the local drug store, but they don&#x27;t carry it anymore.  My 3 daughters and I love this curling brush!</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for an older one - Normally perfect - this one has a bad switch so doesn&#x27;t go to low heat or blow.&lt;br /&gt;I will be checking with sell on a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;These last my wife about 8 months - then we order a new one.</li>
    <li> I really liked it because it leaves my hair soft and with volume, however I was disappointed because the part where you insert the attachments developed a crack and I had to use tape to hold the attachment in place. I had an old Conair hot air brush that I used for about 6 years and never had trouble with it in any way.</li>
    <li> For years I had been using a regular blow dryer.  My hair always looked frizzy and tangled.  After the first time using this dryer I was so impressed.  My hair felt so silky and looked great.  It does take a little longer to dry using this product, but the end result is so worth it.</li>
    <li> A bit bulky but works wonderfully!  Different brush options come in  handy and yield different results.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I have super fine, but heavy hair that refuses to cooperate with just about any and every styling method and product. I&#x27;m also not coordinated enough to screw around with both a hair dryer AND a hairbrush, nor do I care enough to spend too much time trying to master that situation. I tried the Infiniti Pro rotating styler and it was a nightmare. I got it suck in my hair and it was quite unwieldy...so I was apprehensive about another Conair brush/dryer contraption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was redemption. I love this bad boy. Its easy to use, dries my hair (shoulder length) in just a few minutes and its super nice to have the alternative brushes and direct blow drying thingy (if we&#x27;re being honest, i use that attachment to de-fog the bathroom mirror).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read a few reviews saying it was really loud and I have to say...its not. I mean, its not whisper-quiet, but what hair dryer is? In certain positions it can be louder because you may have it closer to or directed towards your ear, but it is by no means remarkably loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few reviews also said it got too hot. Sure thing it does. Its a hair dryer. Go use a traditional dryer for 5 minutes and then try to touch the part where the hot air comes out. Being the not-so-girly gal that I am, I have little knowledge surrounding the precise use of most hair styling equipment (curling irons are my nemesis) so I&#x27;m fairly confident that if I&#x27;m able to use this and not burn myself, I&#x27;m pretty sure you&#x27;ll be ok too. Obviously, touching the metal portion of the one brush will result in some discomfort...its hot metal. duh. I also find it cools off fairly quick too. By the time I&#x27;m done getting ready after drying my hair (15min tops) its cool enough to get shoved back in the drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had one complaint, it would be that it doesnt add any significant volume to my hair. But it gets it dry and smooth in just a few minutes, so I&#x27;m able to throw in some other product to get that volume...but as was mentioned before, my hair is difficult and nothing really gives it much volume. My &#x27;goal&#x27; in buying this was to have a way to quickly and conveniently dry my hair and this more than delivers.</li>
    <li> I love this air brush ! I don&#x27;t like the new ones they came out With now but this is definitively the best , I use it all the time</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok blow dryer, the nozzle needs to be thinner. The nozzle is to big if you are trying to do the Dominic blow out</li>
    <li> I have used this brush for many years.  I have very curly hair and this is the best thing I&#x27;ve found to style my hair.  I LOVE IT and have to have a spare on hand at all times.</li>
    <li> Even on low setting, my fine hair tends to be blown away from the brushes. Plus the handle is a bit large for my hand. I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months, but will try to find a replacement soon.</li>
    <li> This is the second hot air curling brush I purchased. Don&#x27;t think this one is any better than the other one I bought that is not ceramic/ionic.  Be very careful using it on the high setting....you will get burned!  Even the low setting gets very hot. It may just be my hair or my lack of knowledge on how to use this, but I cannot get a curl.  It straightens just fine and leaves a nice shine, but I did not buy it to straighten my hair....I wanted to curl it!</li>
    <li> Works okay, but very stiff brush</li>
    <li> Consider this thing to be as damaging as a flatiron, and use it accordingly. It should not be used on delicate hair on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> I love it!! My hair is very straight &amp; thick. Using this I dry &amp; style at the same time. My hair looks good all day.</li>
    <li> It dries fine but leaves my hair flat and full of static. I put in my guest bathroom and went&lt;br /&gt;back to my old Revlon dryer and round brush!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my daughter, she loves it.</li>
    <li> I tried to make curly hair but it does not work and I smell like my hair got burnt because of the heat.</li>
    <li> This Conair hot air brush is quite hot!  There is no satisfactory intermediate heat setting, but it is sturdy, has lasted well onver a year now and certainly will get your hair dry faster than some air burshes.  It is easy to use.  I would give it a 4.5 if I could.</li>
    <li> I thought I could only love the InStyler, but I love this hot air brush too.  I&#x27;m never going to part with my InStyler but I love this Conair hot air brush, I am one of those people who cannot use a brush and a hairdryer at the same time, this made my hair look great in half the time it took me to style it before.  I like the fact that it has a natural boar hair brush as an attachment and a ceramic plated one, it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve used this product a few times.  I like it, it&#x27;s a bit easier than blow drying for me as I have just-below-the-shoulder length hair and it&#x27;s quite thick.  I&#x27;ve found the trick has been seperating into sections, that really speed up my blowdry time.  Hopefully as I continue to use this brush I will be come more adept at controlling it.  I have thick, wavy/loose curly hair.</li>
    <li> I thought this would speed up my hair routine and perhaps give me stronger curl, but not so.  It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I thought it should.  Will keep it as a back-up or give away later if I never seem to use it.</li>
    <li> Love my dryer, has my hair a flippy and nice and gets to my roots, and I have thick course hair... LOVE THIS!</li>
    <li> The heat comes out the small end of the rod and burns my fingers on my left hand. Poor design. I do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I was really, really hoping this thing would make my hair shiny, but no such luck. It&#x27;s no shinier than when I usta use a normal blow drier and a brush. But it has one BIG thing going for it: I no longer need three hands to blow dry my hair. Now it&#x27;s just one. Well, sometimes two: the second hand is to grab a wad of hair to dry, but that&#x27;s it. This is important because I tore my shoulder in two places, so drying my hair is a miserable chore, or rather it WAS until I got this puppy. Now it&#x27;s a breeze. And I get more lift with it, too. I DO wish it came with a larger brush head attachment, though. But I&#x27;m doing okay with the 1.25&amp;#34;. But dang; no shine. And no curl, either. Just can&#x27;t get a headful of waves with it no matter how I try (unless maybe if I tangle my hair in the brush?). I&#x27;m happier with it than I was with a separate brush, though, because it does make drying easier, and if you have a bad arm, you&#x27;ll like it, too, for that reason.</li>
    <li> I like it but I expected it to be like a flat iron curler. It&#x27;s a blow dryer curler instead.</li>
    <li> Paid a lot of money for this. From the picture I thought it didn&#x27;t have the bore bristles but the rubbery ones. I can&#x27;t work this through my thick hair at all without it getting caught and tangled. a waste of my money</li>
    <li> I had the previous version of this product, but with this new one I was quite amazed with!&lt;br /&gt;Great for those who have voluminous hair like I do, no need anymore to go the beauty shop to have a well-brushed and natural curly and waved, wonderful looking hair! Just loved!!!</li>
    <li> I have owned two of these, and have had the same problem with them both after only about six months of use. This was the best product I could find with a 3/4\\&quot; boars hair brush, which works perfectly to style my short hair. However, the button to push to change the attachments on the first one failed to secure the attachments, and they came off in my hand. The second one had the same problem, except the button and spring actually fell off in my hand. I am contacting Conair about the problem and asking them directly for a replacement. If anyone has a suggestion for a 3/4\\&quot; boars hair barrel, please let me know what it is.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with my purchase.  This is just what I needed and wanted.  I have used both brushes and already have compliments on hair from my coworkers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used hot air brushes for a couple years.  This works better than my last.  The low setting and the larger brush works better for me.  The high setting blows the hair off the bristles.  It&#x27;s nice having the small brush option for different styles though.  I believe my hair stays styled longer and without as much work and injuries using a hot air brush versus a curling iron.</li>
    <li> This this works great. Leaves my hair soft and tamed. Not frizzy. I would recommend it to anyone, especially with short to medium length hair.</li>
    <li> These hard bristles don&#x27;t grab hair, so it makes curling and drying almost impossible. I returned it. I don&#x27;t see how this could work for anyone.</li>
    <li> this was just what I was needed. Im so glad that I got this item. No one else is allowed to use this so I got a &amp;#34;Do not touch&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a Christmas gift. The recipient is very happy with the hot air brush and uses it regularly .</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000A6KD9C Conair 1000W Ionic Hot Brush - BC171CS]]  I have used othe Conair Air Brushes but this Ionic Hot Brush is the  GREATEST!  I have very thick, course textured hair.    I can dry my hair so much faster.  I really enjoy the different   attachments that come with the Hot Air Brush.  I say CONAIR keep this model in your great line of products.</li>
    <li> I looked at both and debated.  Perfector was more money so I decided to try this Conair Hot Air Brush. I absolutely love it. I got compliments on my hair the first time I used it.  It is a terrific choice and saves you money!!</li>
    <li> I bought it and didn&#x27;t expect much.. just wanted to see how it worked. Not well. It&#x27;s very loud for the low amount of air it produces. I guess if you dried your hair in super small sections it would work, but if I had that amount of time on my hands I would use a regular blow drier and hair brush.</li>
    <li> This gets super hot on high, but I read that.  So I use it mostly on low.  My hair is softer, which is a plus. It has more body and is easier to use than brush and hairdryer.  It is very LOUD.  My improvement would be to add a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; button so you could lock in the curl, or just give yourself a break from the heat.  Like my hairdryer has.  All in all I  am glad I ordered this.</li>
    <li> I love this hot air brush! A blow dryer and curling brush in one..just makes it so much easier.  The different heads are great too! It gives my hair so much body and shine! i highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Makes styling my curly hair so much easier, and half the time normally spend with a traditional blow dryer.  I recommend this</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know what it is that you do with this device but I&#x27;ll assume that if you&#x27;re looking at it, you know what it is for.  Here is what I have to say about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife uses it and does magic with her hair.  It makes her sexier and worth more than it costs in my opinion.</li>
    <li> It really nice I love</li>
    <li> Perfect for someone after having shoulder surgery with just one arm to do your hair.  Works best with mid to short hair.  Have been a lifesaver for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product primarily to work on my bangs, but it doesn&#x27;t work well for that cause.  I haven&#x27;t really tried it too much with anything else.  The force of air coming out (even on low) was too strong and just blows all the hair to the side.  I&#x27;m not a professional though, so it could be me.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I had hand surgery and couldn&#x27;t do my hair with two hands. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to, but it doesn&#x27;t give the better results you get using a round brush and a blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Makes doing my hair so much easier and quicker. The brush dries and smooths my hair all in one process.</li>
    <li> It was ok , I should got new one that Rotate itself around. Am guessing it. Would bin easer for. Me Since I have a lot a hair to deal with.?</li>
    <li> LOVE THE WAY MY HAIR COMES OUT . my hair comes out smooth and silky. great product for price !!</li>
    <li> I have a Conair Hot Air Brush with a detangler bristle for years and that worked very well until it died on me the other day.  I ordered this model, thinking it would work the same but I am very disappointed by its quality.  The brush is flimsy and does not detangle the hair.  The hair ends up being frizzy and poofy.  The power is too high, even on a low setting.  The on/off button is so close to your hand that it turns off all the time.  And the handle is so big that it&#x27;s not made for people with small hands, maybe a giant clown perhaps.  Very disappointed in this buy.  Should have stuck with the same bristle type air brush but a different brand.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really use it much</li>
    <li> Love it - works great and makes my hair less frizzy</li>
    <li> Waste of Money. its now in my closet with all the other useless products.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer! It &#x27;s good for straighten your hair nice and flat! You can curl your hair at the ends with the brush!</li>
    <li> I gave this item as a gift because it is a fantastic hot air brush.</li>
    <li> Flattens out my hair too much</li>
    <li> The brushes are way too large.  nothing like the last one I had if you have long hair this will work for you but not short hair I can not get my hair on the brush long enough too even get it to start to dry.  Not a good buy for me</li>
    <li> I am disappointed in this brush/dryer - it only tangles in my hair and does not produce the detangling or curling effects described. For me this product was a waste of money. I opened the package so cannot return. What is missing is sufficient heat to make the product effective enough to produce straightening and/or a slight curl on the ends. I used once and found this brand/style does not really detangle (actually the opposite) and left the ends of my hair nearly untouched. To be fair I should add I am African-American w/medium length hair so that may be a contributing cause of insufficient heat/poor detangling effect. Just saying.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because I like the ease of using a brush and dryer all in one unit.  This comes with two sizes of brush attachments and both work well.  It has two settings for the dryer air flow, high/low.  While it styles nicely, it does get REALLY hot....not sure it&#x27;s good for your hair on a daily basis.  Wish it had a high and low temp setting.  Other than that it works nice.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS!! My hair is naturally curly (tight curl). I used to spend 10-15 mins blow drying and brushing straight my hair, now I timed it, wet to dry and wavy with volume in 5 mins!! Less time &#x3D;less heat exposure, less damage. Plus, I don&#x27;t need to curl it after drying! I wish I had tried this years ago! ( I have a layered bob above my shoulders.)</li>
    <li> Wish the smaller barrel was metal and not plastic.  Does get a bit hot to the touch to switch barrels while in use.  Have to let it cool down between changes.</li>
    <li> The best blow brush on market.  I&#x27;ve tried numerous brushes  and blowers, but nothing compares. I have thick winery hair and this is perfect.</li>
    <li> I thought this product was self rotating, used it only once and my hair got all tangled. Did not like it at all.</li>
    <li> I love this! Takes a while for my long, thick hair, but comes out soo shiny and smooth!</li>
    <li> Hair got tangled on this thing and was hard to get it untangled</li>
    <li> This is the second of this model that I purchased.  I absolutely love the natural bristle brush and 2 speed power, but after 3 years the first is getting wobbley, so I grabbed this one while it is still available.  Only reason for a rating of 4 instead of 5 relates to the smaller brush...it is not ceramic like the larger one, therefore I do not get super shiny hair when I use it...that&#x27;s a bummer because I sometimes like the curly look that comes with the smaller brush.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I was blow drying my hair, then using a 1-inch flat iron, and I was looking for a single tool to do both jobs. My hair is short, thin and slightly wavy. It comes with  a 2nd brush attachment which is 3/4 inch. This size works best for me. I have been using this brush about 7 weeks and there is a learning curve to get the best out of this brush. It does get very hot so I usually start it with full power and then switch to the low speed. It probably takes about 5-minutes to do my hair. Some reviews mentioned the placement of the on/off switch made it easy to accidentally turn it off. Being aware this might happen, I have not had a problem.  I wish the ceramic ion was on the barrel of the small brush, but it is only on the 1.25 inch brush. I am happy with it and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this tool!  What an awesome way to get a blow out without having a stylist do it.  This works great!!</li>
    <li> I bought this air brush after using one that my friend has. I love that it leaves my hair shiny and soft without much hassle. It&#x27;s so much easier to use than a standard blow dryer and round brush. I&#x27;ve used this to dry wet hair, as well as style already dry (or mostly dry) hair with same results. It does take a little practice to get the hang of it, but well worth the minor effort. I will agree that the placement of the on/off switch is not the best. But if you just twist the brush so that the button is not near your thumb, you&#x27;re good to go. The high setting gets really hot, so I end up switching to the low setting after a quick pass on high. Only the larger brush attachment has the ceramic plate which acts like a flat iron. The smaller brush may be best for people with shorter hair, but you lose the ceramic plate. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Conair Ceramic Ionic Hot Air Brush!  I used to blow dry and flat iron my hair, which was very damaging.  The hot air brush makes my hair soft and silky and it has a lot more volume.  No need to use the flat iron anymore because the hot air brush does not make my hair frizzy.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to damage my hair at all!  I thought I would be able to use the hot air brush to make my hair curly; although, I haven&#x27;t been able to do that, it does make nice soft waves.  Also, it&#x27;s not really a time saver, but I still would highly reccommend it!</li>
    <li> I love the actual brush and not the plastic brush.l  It styles my hair while drying and it is easy to handle.  I like the two size brushes</li>
    <li> Had it before and it burned out so i had to buy another one its the best one of the easiest items i ever used on my hair i cant live without it</li>
    <li> I loved my old cobalt blue curler and bought a different Conair model before purchasing this one. I really wanted the comb barrel. What a disappointment the Conair Hot Air Curling Combo was. It only had 300 watts of power and this was not indicated anywhere on the packaging. It went into the trash. I bought this Conair BC171NCS Ceramic Ionic Hot Air Brush with the brush barrel out of desperation. I was very happy to find I could use the barrel of my old hot air curler on this one. The Conair Hot Air Curling Combo (trash) barrels are NOT compatible. Anyone who has bought the Conair Hot Air Curling Combo and was disappointed with its performance, this Conair BC171NCS Ceramic Ionic Hot Air Brush is one the you should have bought. It has two power stettings, high has lots of power to dry and it gets hot, low is just right for styling. Love it for my fine shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> The base get&#x27;s SO hot that it will burn your hair and you can&#x27;t control the temp.  Look for the Helen of Troy, it is a plastic/rubber base and brush.  I have two in different sizes and love them.</li>
    <li> This air brush is a great styling tool.  I would have given it 5 stars if it had a heat control.  It does get too hot at times.</li>
    <li> I love this. My hair is so soft, shiny. It made a big difference.  I love doing my hair every day.</li>
    <li> I give this a two rating because it is probably good fro someone&#x27;s hair but not for black women.  I understand this perfectly but the product should not imply that it is for all types of hair because it is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> its really nice, useful, and will change your whole experience, its nice to have, don&#x60;t miss it.&lt;br /&gt;really something new</li>
    <li> okay except for the bulky handle, which is anything but ergonomic and awkward to use.  On/off switch also difficult to use.</li>
    <li> This is easy to use even for a first timer like me. My frizz is gone, and the warm air is more gentle than the blow dryer. It was a good price on amazon. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a great tool.  I am totally uncoordinated using a curling iron or straightener, but I can use this with fantastic results in minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shoulder length hair and I like it with a little bit of volume on the top and this provides it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the power is a little low for using it a dryer with the blower attachment, but I use it after drying.</li>
    <li> Why did it take me so long to discover this air brush. I have fine hair and have been growing it out for the past couple of years. Have had short hair my whole life so learning how to manage shoulder length is new. This brush has made a major difference, love it.</li>
    <li> I would have given it a 5 Star, Except that my previous one failed after about 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;I love it when it works like it should.  but again the previous one failed. I am hopeful that&lt;br /&gt;this one lasts longer.  As far as performance, it is the best one I have ever used.</li>
    <li> i love this product. perfect. do its job and its not too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;a must have!, even for a beginner in the &#x27;&#x27;doing yourself hair&#x27;&#x27; like me.</li>
    <li> This is big and cumbersome. Almost impossible to use on short hair. Forget trying to use this on dry hair to give a little curl or wave.</li>
    <li> Ineffective product. It doesn&#x27;t curl or straighten well, and neither the ions or ceramic helped my flyaways a bit. What&#x27;s the point?</li>
    <li> Great seller, awesome product, great package!! Recommend!</li>
    <li> My Conair blow dryer did not last very long and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this particular blow dryer to anyone</li>
    <li> 1) It gets HOT. 2) The button to eject the styling head is right where your hand goes to hold this thing. Otherwise, it works great.</li>
    <li> I went with this just to get a different kind of curls and to have another option when I&#x27;m doing my hair, this product works great and the curls really look nice when you are done. Thank you amazon for another great product.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; is exactly right. I have never owned or used a heat brush like this but after a few uses, its medium setting does not work already, just disappointed.</li>
    <li> my oldest daughter has very curly/fine hair.....never blow dried it too much b/c i was worried her hair is so fine that it would damage it, and when i did, even w/serums in b/f the blow dryer , it would be very frizzy looking.  this bad boy however, works wonders on her hair, wet or dry.  a little serum brushed through first, we always use the low setting, it gets plenty hot for her hair type.  have only used the larger brush part, just b/c it works so well.  it was able to give her hair lots of volume, and kept it nice and smooth.... i have used the high setting on my hair, mine is medium/thick, w/ lots of waves and some curl.  it did the trick, acted as blowdryer/curling iron in one if you want.....it did get hot enough tho to hurt when held close to scalp on high setting if hair is dry, or to touch after being on for a bit, but won&#x27;t burn through anything, like carpet or anything, b/c of support of brush bristles, which do not get hot.  i showed my big sis, who has very thick , wavy hair, it still gave her hair lots of volume and shine....it gets used a lot.</li>
    <li> Reasonable price - just what I wanted - gives a salon blow-out look. Easy to use - much easier that a round brush and blow dryer!</li>
    <li> One of the brushes was damaged. Only cold air came out and would not style my hair. It did not function properly</li>
    <li> Super easy to use.. Works better for people with short hair.. My hair when its long is super thick and wavy...was planning on cutting my hair anyways.. This little tool does the trick</li>
    <li> I really like this brush.  If you think you are going to completely blow dry your hear with this - you are mistaken.  This is great to use when you are almost done blow drying &#x3D; and need to do some touch up that a big blow drier can&#x27;t master.  My last one allowed me to turn the brush easier, but I still like it.</li>
    <li> While Conair does make an Ionic version of this product, THIS IS NOT IONIC. No where on the packaging does it say it is Ionic. This is ceramic, but not Ionic. The Ionic version of this product has an MSRP of $79.99. Don&#x27;t be fooled. Most of these &amp;#34;Ionic&amp;#34; products on Amazon, ARE NOT IONIC. Check the model number you are thinking of purchasing with the manufacturer&#x27;s website first, to make sure it really is IONIC if that is important to you. I had to send mine back and since I can&#x27;t trust whoever is writing up these product descriptions is being honest, I&#x27;ll have to go to a beauty supply store to find one. I am a Prime member of Amazon who orders several times a week and I love Amazon, but this product description is WRONG! On the plus side, Amazon does make returns super easy!!</li>
    <li> Hot air brush was exactly what I was looking for at a great price.  Easy to handle, instant heat for quick styling of hair.</li>
    <li> I just love this dryer.  It works fast because it is hot enough.  It is perfect for short hair .  I recommend it</li>
    <li> I love this product, it is so much easier than trying to use a blow dryer and hair brush.  Although it is not quite as powerful as regular hair dryer, a couple of additional passes through your hair will do the job.</li>
    <li> Product works very well and I bought a second one for a gift.  Definitely easier to manipulate than a blow dryer and brush.</li>
    <li> This item didnt work for me. I have semi wavy hair and it just made my hair frizzy and took too long to get the style dried. The bristles didnt hold my hair in place and blew it everywhere, which caused frizzyness. Much faster to dry my hair and use flat iron. It does give your hair bounce but I wanted quick style for the mornings. So if you dont mind taking 20mns or more on hair, than this could work for you! I returned it.</li>
    <li> I have never used a hot air brush before and will need more practice with it to become an expert.  But I like not having to hold both a brush and a hair dryer to style my hair.</li>
    <li> Let me preface this by stating that I have have fairly thin hair. The brush works quickly and my hair is shiny and smooth when it is done. The only downsides are the the cord is a bit too short and I often accidentally shut off the brush in the middle of drying my hair (I think that is a major design flaw).</li>
    <li> i agree with all the 1 star comments: it tangles my hair; the air does not come through the brush; the handle is too fat for comfort; and the noise is excruciating enough for earplugs. Hence, I am shopping for another blow dryer brush</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for quite a while, [did not buy it from Amazon] I have curly hair, it does smooth your hair while drying it, but there&#x27;s smoke coming out of my hair, because it burns, my hair, it comes out in chunks. Never again.</li>
    <li> I bought it online because I forgot to buy it when I went to the store and really did not want to go back out.&lt;br /&gt;I later went to a store and saw a few similar to this one and they were just about the same price but only had one attachment.&lt;br /&gt;Online I actually got a better rate for it.</li>
    <li> What i needed , and great for the price . Just it could be much better if had more power , but still does the job</li>
    <li> Love this hot air brush! It leaves my hair silky and fuller looking. Takes care of all the frizz. My friend just ordered one and now my other friend wants one too. I take mine everywhere I go and I have since it came on the market, If you want shine and fuller looking hair, that looks like a professional blowout then this brush is for you..</li>
    <li> I love this hot air brush. I finally caved in to buy a new one since my last one was purchased in the 80&#x27;s. Wow, I know huh? I figured there have to have been improvements since then, right? This one meets my upgrade criteria. I like that it has 3 attachments although honestly I only use the big brush one, and the brushes have both plastic and fiber bristles which gives good grip and it heats up very quickly which helps dry the hair quicker. Wonderful product and I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> great to style and dry my hair at the same time</li>
    <li> there are many things I like and don&#x27;t like about this hot air brush.  What  I like is good connection of attachments.  Good air flow. Easy to use.  I wish it had a longer cord, cool air flow to set curls.  It is too easy to shut off, the hot setting is too hot, usually only use on low.  I have to use a towel to remove the attachments cuz it is soooo hot.  Don&#x27;t ever use it without the brushes.  Use my regular hair dryer to start the drying process, then I style.  It is ok for the money spent.</li>
    <li> I bought it before and I love it. This time I bought it as a gift for one of my family member who asked me about it before and like it too.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in time.&lt;br /&gt;Worked nicely and leaf the hair silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful it is very hot but you can adjust the hotness level though.</li>
    <li> This hot air brush is not bad at all for the price. It&#x27;s definitely not a full substitute for the Perfector that I&#x27;ve used before but it helps me get by pretty well. The hair drier dries well with lots of power but it&#x27;s shaped wrong for the way I need to use a hair drier.  I knew that up front.  I use it as a back-up to my go to drier and when I travel because it packs easily.&lt;br /&gt;I like it as a hair styler.  It doesn&#x27;t handle quite as easily as the perfector or get as close on the hair. Even so, after a little practice, I can get a very nice style in a short time. I find the biggest difference for me between the Conair and the Perfector is on humid days.  The Perfector gives me a great style that holds even on the most humid, rainy days.  The Conair style looks great when I leave the house then my hair starts to frizz if there&#x27;s a lot of humidity.  It still doesn&#x27;t frizz nearly as much as it would if I didn&#x27;t use the Conair Ionic brush though.&lt;br /&gt;Sooo... If you can only spend around $20, this is the one for you.  Then save up and treat yourself to the Perfector down the road.</li>
    <li> easy for styling fast</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.I have short hair and I use it to dry and curl my hair at the same time.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife, she likes it but the bristles falls off fairly easy. Don&#x27;t recommend for thick hair. But it&#x27;s worth a try for $20.</li>
    <li> I love this! I&#x27;m so glad i found this, i really would not be able to style my hair anymore if i didn&#x27;t have this. I have crazy, frizzy, curly hair. and this can get it straight and smoothe in 20 mins, better than a hair dresser. I usually dont even need the flat iron after unless its humid out lol its more of a styler than an actual dryer, i usually let my hair mostly air dry then do like 3 section, one at a time. i start at the root, push the brush into my hair and kind of turn the brush as i pull it down, keeping it tight. Amaing!</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. I have thick hair.</li>
    <li> I am growing my hair long to donate to Locks of Love...this device helps me to tame my longer hair...</li>
    <li> Way too hot, there is no cooling button.  I almost burned my scalp</li>
    <li> Do not like this at all....no control to lower heat...gets very hot and difficult to not burn ears or scalp when holding near head.  The&lt;br /&gt;large brush attachment comes loose when winding hair...poorly designed!  Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> This brush is a life saver, or  I should say a hair saver.  I look so much better when I use this brush.  I should get another one.</li>
    <li> If this had a longer chord, I would have given it four stars. I returned it because it had this really loud, annoying high pitch sound when it got close to my ears. So I didn&#x27;t really give it a try.</li>
    <li> I returned item.  I am sure it worked well.  Easy to return.  It was too big for my length of hair.  The bristles made it too big fo rme to use.</li>
    <li> It was okay, not really what I wanted so I gave it to a friend that really liked it and worked great on her type and texure of hair.</li>
    <li> El producto que compre es exactamente lo que quería. Me funciona de manera perfecta para no usar el secador de pistola que es mas incomodo. Este producto es excelente.</li>
    <li> Bought this beacuse I saw one similar to it on tv...it works just a they say. Gets a little hot at times.</li>
    <li> I cant seem to master using a brush and a blow dryer this solved that for me.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Does not curl my hair like I was hoping it would.  My hair is determined to be straight tho.</li>
    <li> I have been using hot air brushes to curl my damp hair for years, and my latest one finally bit the dust.  After reading the reviews, I thought this would be a good replacement, and I really wanted to like it.  It turned out to be a disappointment, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With other hot air brushes, direct contact with the hot element is what has made my hair soft, shiny, and dry.  The thick bristles on the tube attachments of this brush do not allow very much of your hair to touch the heating element (unless you really tug, which is not great for damp hair), so basically your hair is sitting about a centimeter away from the tourmaline ceramic element.  The large tube attachment has both bristles and plastic spokes, which are different lengths, so when your hair is wrapped around the tube it is almost in a square shape as it dries, resulting in uneven proximity to the heated element.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no button that loosens the tube attachment so you can quickly and smoothly unfurl your hair, so you have to twirl the whole (rather large and bulky) body of the machine to get your hair out.  This tired my wrist out before I was halfway done doing my hair, and the rushed job on the second half shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers mentioned, it is very easy to accidentally move the power/temp button with your fingers as you do your hair, resulting in a few surprise temperature changes and turnings-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did the best I could with it so I could leave the house to buy another dryer.  My hair doesn&#x27;t look terrible, but the texture is more frizzy and less silky/shiny than it was with other hot air brushes, the curls are not as tight, my scalp hurts from trying to move my hair through the VERY dense bristles on the attachment, and my wrists hurt from constantly twirling the entire apparatus to uncurl my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it two stars rather than one because my hair is dry and basically presentable--but it does not look or feel as nice as it normally does, andrequired too much struggle for such a lackluster result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I really wanted to like it, but I would suggest spending a few extra dollars on whatever model has features that mitigate the shortcomings of this hot air dryer.</li>
    <li> My first one lasted ten years, and I swore I would find another just like it.  I did, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Good price and pretty strong hot air brush dryer.&lt;br /&gt;it comes with small and large brushes. even just good for as regular hot air dryer for short to medium hair.</li>
    <li> I just love this , matter of fact I have 3 . Just in case one brake I now have a backup.....  This is sooooo true</li>
    <li> I was buying this as a gift for my sister, she seems to like it since I saw her using it a good amount.</li>
    <li> Love it-more than enough power.  Reason for the 4 stars instead of 5--wish the on-off switch was in a different area.</li>
    <li> I am stingy on product reviews, but this item was seriously a wonderful purchase for me. My hair is thick, but easily gets out of control fuzzy and out of shape on humid days. But after I started using this dryer with the small brush, my hair stays silky and &#x27;in shape&#x27;. I sometimes dry/style my hair before I go to bed and my hair still looks good the next morning. I really feel sexy having straight shiny hair and strangers have started to make complements about how nice I look. As tacky as it may sound, buying this has given me an experience that is priceless.</li>
    <li> It takes a few try&#x27;s to get used to using it but it works great. I wish that it had a cool setting as the heat from the blower does get hot.</li>
    <li> I expected it rotayting and it&#x27;s not very potent. I&#x27;m a little disapointed about the product. I expected something diferent.</li>
    <li> This is an okay drying system. There is no way to regulate the heat, however, and it gets very hot. I have to alternate using it with another dryer of this type.</li>
    <li> I have a very thin hair so it gets dry very quickly, but even for that short time the brush gets so hot that I have wait till it get cold again or else it burns my skin</li>
    <li> Best hot air brush out there for thick hair - I have purchased it many times over the years - I use them until the bristles wear down.  Really grips well without getting stuck in the hair, and leaves hair full and smooth.  Only improvement would be to offer the hard plastic and nylon brush option in two sizes - currently the smaller option is just the nylon brush, which doesn&#x27;t grip thick hair.  Highly recommend, and hope it is never discontinued.</li>
    <li> It does your hair wonderful, I had one similar years ago I really like the smaller one has real brushes on it, keeps the hair from slipping, takes the frizzies out of my hair for me, gets nice and hot, I&#x27;d buy another to have on hand.</li>
    <li> I did not like the quality of the air brush and if I returned it I would of only rec&#x27;d a partial credit</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of this. I find it more effective to just use a round brush and blow dryer. I don&#x27;t think it smooths well. Now it&#x27;s just one more appliance under my bathroom sink.</li>
    <li> This 1000 watt dryer and brush curls my fine hair quickly and easily. If I prefer straight hair I just pull the brush through my hair with out making a curl.  Makes it smooth and not electric. The mechanism for attaching the brush to the body of the dryer has a good lock so that it does not come apart when I use it.</li>
    <li> Difficult to use with shoulder length hair because it  Does not grab the hair at all. A big waste of money.</li>
    <li> Conair is known in hair drying. Low and affordable price, does the purpose and last. My wife and my daughter have no complain so far.</li>
    <li> With it had rotation. I think the brush could be better too but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Love the power of this machine, however, do not like the bristles on the brush.  The cord is WAY too short.  My plug is at the bottom of my bathroom and I can barely reach my head.  How much more would it cost to put a couple more inches on the cord.</li>
    <li> This is just what I ordered, but I found it more difficult to use than I expected--most likely it would be easier if my hair were just a little bit longer.  I&#x27;m trying to transition from short to medium-length, but need to tame the wild curls.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I has shoulder surgery and was in a sling for 12 weeks.  It would have been great for one-armed  hair styling if my hair was longer.  The brushes were too big to grab my short hair.  It is a nice hairdryer and works well now that I have two arms to use</li>
    <li> My wife has arthritis, so it would have been much easier if the tip rotated instead of her having to rotate the entire unit.</li>
    <li> This is the only blow dryer I have found that is easy to use and does a great job on my short curly hair.  I love the metal based attachment with the ridged and bristled brush.  It easily grabs the hair, dries it, styles it and adds a nice shine to it. I have had longer hair and have had the same great results.  I have tried several other brush blow dryers but honestly this is the best I have ever found. I have purchased 3 extras in case they ever discontinue this model.  That&#x27;s how much I depend on this dryer.</li>
    <li> Really good. Exactly whay i was expected. My girlfriend was so happy.</li>
    <li> Not good at all. Brushes are very hard and stiff.</li>
    <li> Great brush at a good price</li>
    <li> I truly wanted to love this hot air brush. Did a lot of research and this one came out on top. Like the Ionic feature - hair does have a better shine and less fly a ways. However while the blowing heat is doing your hair, it&#x27;s also blowing down on the handle as well. Your hand does get pretty darn hot. Not a good thing. I will see about returning it. Not sure how that works as I&#x27;ve used it twice.</li>
    <li> Barrel broke right away. Bad design.</li>
    <li> This is second time that I purchased the brush, and I believe it does the job well, considering that it makes it easier to operate a blow dryer with installed brush in it. The only problem that I have experienced after few months of use with both brushes, is that it cracks in same spot (slot where brush gets connected with dryer) but it is an inexpensive item, I guess life span is short too.</li>
    <li> I tried several of the hot air brushes and this one seemed to work best.  The brushes are a bit large for my short hair though - I wish they made a 1/2&amp;#34; size.  The on and off button is really stiff and hard to push up and down.  But the handle is a good size for my medium sized hands, unlike some of the other brands.</li>
    <li> Not too happy. The bristles are very hard and even sharp on some. The hairdryer would do fine in a pinch but not for everyday use. Went back to my old one.</li>
    <li> Replacing and old one exact model very happy</li>
    <li> The blower works fine but one of the brush attachments doesn&#x27;t fit properly on the bower, very frustrating!!</li>
    <li> This does not work on my thick curly hair, i am left with a frizzy tangled mess.  I wish i hadn&#x27;t spent the money on this product.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product, but the bristles are to rigid and even on a lower setting I smelled my hair burning.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. The handle is to fat to hold comfortably.  The bristles did not grasp my hair well &amp; did not give me a good curl with either attachment.  I do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this style of hair dryer first in Japan about seven years ago, and loved it. I&#x27;m not coordinated enough to handle a brush and hair dryer at the same time, so this style does the trick for getting a smooth blow-out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The really nice thing about this one is the boar-bristle style brushes; I&#x27;d noticed a lot of damage on my hair from plastic-bristle hair brushes/dryers, so a trim and hair dryer switch has been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t had any problems with it (and I&#x27;ve had it for over a year now), so if it did happen to break down the road, there&#x27;s a good chance I&#x27;d buy the exact same one again. Quite nice.</li>
    <li> I always had trouble holding a brush in one hand and a dryer in the other.  Now I have it all in one and it works great.  Two sizes of brush for different parts of the head.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years.  I have long thick curly hair and this works great to straighten it and give it lots of bounce.  I always get compliments on my hair everywhere I go.  I personalty use the bigger barrel.  I do modify it by removing the bristles, as my hair gets stuck in it.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer for drying my naturally curly hair.  It is so hard for me to use a brush and a hair dryer together but the all in one combo is perfect.  It has a great feel in your hand, its lightweight and works quick.</li>
    <li> You first have to blow dry your hair before using this product as it will not dry your hair. When you hair is pretty much dry/very slightly damp, use this tool and get the round brush effect you&#x27;re looking for. It&#x27;s really easy to use and makes my hair look great. I wish there was a bigger size round brush attachment for it though.</li>
    <li> I like the way this brush works and the fact that we get a big and a small brush with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it does get VERY hot when using high setting, so I have to always remember to use it on low.</li>
