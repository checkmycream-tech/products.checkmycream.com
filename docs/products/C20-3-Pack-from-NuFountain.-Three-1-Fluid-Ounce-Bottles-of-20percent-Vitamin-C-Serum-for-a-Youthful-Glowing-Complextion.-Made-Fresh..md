<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I just need to get into a better routine of using this product everyday to see long term results happen</li>
    <li> Why buy expensive Vitamin C serum from Skinceuticals and others when you can get freshly made serum that works wonderful through NuFountain! Thank you NuFountain for making it affordable! Vitamin C serum is the best way to get a flawless complexion.</li>
    <li> Nufountain makes a great Vit C product and I really like how it makes my skin look and feel.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. I have hyper-pigmentation on my legs and it has started to work on them. I can already see a difference, but it is too soon to tell whether it will remove them completely.  I will keep using this product. The shipping was excellent and everything was packaged so nicely. Thanks for the wonderful customer service! Cindy</li>
    <li> I was told using 20% vit C is ideal. This sale saved some me some money. It&#x27;s hard to compare with the other products. I&#x27;m only on the 2nd vial. So far so good.</li>
    <li> I have never ordered vitamin C serum, so don&#x27;t know if I am qualified to know if this product is better than others. The company is great, they make the serum when you order it, so it is fresh, and ship quickly. Good price point too. I ordered two bottles and got the third one free, and have just finished my first bottle. My skin looks great, but I can&#x27;t tell if it is the C serum or the mix of my other skin products. The C serum goes on comfortably and I use it morning and night in addition to TNS recovery serum and emu oil. I am really dry which is why I use the oil. I think the C serum makes my skin more even. The effects may be subtle, but every dermatologist recommends it and there is strong research backing it, so I am sticking with it as part of my skin care.</li>
    <li> Have been using for about 3 weeks. I don&#x27;t see huge results but can tell that it has had some effect. My skin sems to have more of a glow to it. I think it will take it longer than 3 weeks for results to be dramatic. Am uisng in conjunction with retin A product - seems to be a good combo</li>
    <li> This will be my first time using Nufountain C20. I usually use Avalon vitamin C serum so my review isn&amp;iexcl;¦t really on this product, but on the benefits of using the vitamin C serum. I started using the Avalon line last year however I was not consistent with the usage because the price of one bottle same abit high and with this economy one can&amp;iexcl;¦t buy these products too often no matter how much we would like to indulge ourselves. Anyway I have found that using the vitamin C has given me a clearer complexion and it has gradually faded away my marks &amp; scars. I became a consistent user early this year (2011) as I found that when I look in the mirror my marks were disappearing slowly. Now remember the miracle does not happen overnight so consistency is key to a good regimen. I was using Avalon serum in conjunction with the facial cream and now I have ran out of the serum and I am keeping up with the cream. I did not want to buy the Avalon line again due to the price so when I came across this product I thought to try it and of course the three for two deal put it over the top as a why not try it. If it turns out to be a good product then I have a good supply for a while and if not, well, I just will chuck it up to another no good product º will keep in touch with results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: FOUND OUT THAT THIS WAS NOT A GOOD PRODUCT AT ALL. AVALON MAYBE PRICEY BUT I WILL STICK WITH PRICEY ANY DAY THEN TO BUY THESE THREE BOTTLES AT A LOW PRICE THAT DID NOT DO ANYTHING. I HAVE LEARNED THAT A GOOD PRODUCT IS NEVER CHEAP AND A CHEAP PRODUCT IS NEVER GOOD, SO I GOT WHAT I PAID FOR. THE CONSISTENCY OF PRODUCT IS WATERY, AND IT DOES NOT WORK ON THE MARKS AT ALL THE ONLY THING IT DOES IS GIVE ONE ACNE WHICH IF THAT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR I WOULD JUST EAT JUNK FOOD. WILL NOT PURCHASE AGAIN</li>
    <li> I tried this product on the insistence of a friend but didn&#x27;t really have high expectations. My expectations were exceeded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for 4+ months now (just re-ordered, thus the review. so it seems 3 bottles last about a quarter of a year...) primarily for my complexion. I felt like I was returning to my teen years due to pimples cropping up on my face. It definitely helped there - I rarely have them now and when they do appear they are much smaller and don&#x27;t last as long. However, the great bonus for me was that it&#x27;s almost completely removed hyper-pigmentation I had on my forehead. I had used creams by Obagi that were supposed to fade it but never did. I&#x27;d pretty much given up on getting rid of it. So imagine my surprise when I noticed one day that I could hardly see it anymore! I&#x27;d say that I had been using it daily (in the a.m. before applying face lotion and make up) for 4-6 weeks or so when I noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended to improve overall complexion and to fade hyper-pigmentation.</li>
    <li> Hello       I love this product was, and I asked this  Brightened my skin good  But unfortunately there was an error in packaging, where it lost 1 / 4 of the product  Please make sure the closing time so as not to spill  Today I bought a new offer and got 2 1 free  I hope that you get them without leakage or sinned  Thanks</li>
    <li> This product is simply amazing and it&#x27;s very fresh and made to order.  I quality if phenomenal and it&#x27;s amazing on my skin.  It makes me feel like I had a facial.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.   I am using this every day.  I will let you know when I am in my 60&#x27;s !!   Ha, ha, just kidding--I&#x27;m 65 !!! People guess me for 50&#x27;s !!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 52 &amp; have been using this product for almost one year. I had hyper-pigmentation on my upper chest (I&#x27;m guessing due to sun exposure &amp;/or birth control pills), but within a few months of using C20 it was gone! I even pat a bit under my eyes. A little goes a long way. The 3 bottles lasted me almost 11 months. If you want your skin to glow, just buy them!</li>
    <li> I tried this product after using Avalon organics vitamin C facial serum. I liked the Avalon product, but read that I shouldn&#x27;t use tinted vitamin C since I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell if it had oxidized. I purchased this because the price was so great. While using it I noticed that I was getting blackheads--something that I never had before. I think it has something to do with blackheads being oil in your pores that has oxidized and the vitamin C furthering the oxidation process. It&#x27;s possible that I was using too much of the product. You&#x27;re only supposed to use a few drops, but I never paid attention to how many drops I used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also didn&#x27;t see much improvement in my skin with this product. I&#x27;m in my 20s and unfortunately have adult acne. And since my skin is so sensitive I end up with red marks that don&#x27;t go away for weeks, sometimes months. With the Avalon product I noticed a reduction after the first use. My red marks became pink; they were still there, but any reduction in redness was progress. With this product nothing really happened--except the blackheads. I&#x27;ve since gone back to Avalon organics vitamin C. Even with their new formula I&#x27;ve continued to see improvements. I also like that it is organic. And while I don&#x27;t know how old the vitamin C is, at least it&#x27;s helping my skin rather than creating a new problem.</li>
    <li> I have tried many vitamin C serums over the course of 10 years.  This product is very high quality for a very reasonable price.  I am extremely pleased with the results!  I am 51 years old and I receive many compliments on my skin.  I especially like that this product is made fresh with every order.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and product arrives nicely packaged and fresh. My skin definitely benefitted from this product after a few days. A++++</li>
    <li> I have been using C20 from NuFountain, the price is the best of all other products, and I enjoy using the product.&lt;br /&gt;The company ships the products quickly with a great packaging.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the quick results I am seeing from using this product.  I have tried other very expensive vitamin c products, but am seeing the same results with this product.  The instructions given and tips by previous users were very helpful. My skin is very hydrated and looks refreshed.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great value for the price.  I&#x27;ve been using it for&lt;br /&gt;almost two weeks and I like the results I&#x27;m seeing.  Item arrived&lt;br /&gt;a couple days earlier than anticipated.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe it but it really has made a big difference in my complexion.  The tone has evened out and fine lines are significantly reduced.  I also use Boots No7 moisturizer as well and the Intense Beauty Serum, both of which I also recommend.  C20 is my newest addition to my regimen and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  After much research, NuFountian was rated one of the highest quality and best price. Plus, they do not use an fillers or additives.  It&#x27;s a great product and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I am so mad about this product gives me break out. I bought this because I saw those reviews....If you have a nice skin and want to keep that way ...safe you $$$$ and buy better products.&lt;br /&gt;xoxo</li>
    <li> I am turning 47 this month.  I have 3 children 27, 25, and youngest 19.  When I introduce myself to new people they can&#x27;t believe my age.  I have tried every face cream out there including Dr. Perricone products.....VERY expensive and slightly effective.  Let&#x27;s just get back to basics ladies!!!!  Stop getting suckered into these expensive face care products.......here is what I use and it works like crazy.  I wash my face with Eclos Facial cleanser from Walgreens 6.8fl oz for about 12.00.......then I use this C-20 from NuFountain made fresh (other vitamin C liquids I have used are already yellowed with age......this is pure and clear) and then I use a couple dots of  Vitamin E oil mixed with Oil of Olay night of Olay firming cream.....I use the C both morning and night.......I use the E and night of Olay at night......After the C in the morning I ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS use sunblock......my choice is Banana Boat Protect &amp; Hydrate SPF30.  Keep it simple........keep it cheap.......why pay a lot when simple works!!!!  Tweak it for you, but for sure ADD this C-20 to your regiment........you won&#x27;t be sorry!!</li>
    <li> It really meets my expectation. I am very pleased with this product especially because of its freshness and quality. Fantastic</li>
    <li> NuFountain is a solid company.  The C Asorbic acid showed immediate reults.  Product was easy to use and apply.  The story for me here is also the customer service at NuFountain.  After a delivery botch-up attributed to the USPS, NuFountain literally jumped through hoops to ensure I received a new order and they followed up two times to see if it was delivered and I was happy.  This was for a tiny order too!  Great job!&lt;br /&gt;Emilio</li>
    <li> I am 31 and always looking for preventative ways to keep my skin from aging.  I get facials regularly and they always praise the effects of Vitamin C.  I bought this product, which I find almost exact to Skincueticals, at a fraction of the price.  I&#x27;m obsessed as it helps with elasticity, leaves my skin glowing and even clears up break outs faster.  The last time I ordered I got the 3 pack.....that was the only mistake.  It goes bad and I ended up throwing a bottle and a half away because it oxidized and tuned a yellowish color.  Buy one at a time....you will love the way your  skin looks and feels!</li>
    <li> Get a quality product for a fraction of the cost of many other sellers. I buy the three-pack, and keep the unused bottles in the refrigerator. Never had an issue with discoloration or losing potency. I transfer a weeks worth of serum into a small dark vial with dropper, so I am not opening the big bottle on a daily basis. Would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I use this product every morning and have recommended it to many others.  I like the fact that it is fresh has no additives.</li>
    <li> My research for a PLAIN Vitamin C solution for my face took a month, but I finally found what I was looking of on Amazon.  This NuFountain Fresh Cosmetics C20 is just that - only Vitamin C, with no added chemicals.  It IS fresh, made as the order comes in, and shipped out fast.  There are also no preservatives, so it is best to store extra bottles in the refrigerator until they are needed.  My first bottle lasted a month, with daily AM &amp; PM use of 10 drops each time.  It didn&#x27;t turn yellow or brown, as had my previous brand.  I am now about to  place another order (I shared my order with a friend), as my facial brown spots are so much lighter with this serum.  I HIGHLY recommend NuFountain Vitamin C!</li>
    <li> This product turned an amber color after 3 weeks using it, even with keeping bottle closed in cool, and dark place.  Can&#x27;t use it after it turns amber.  Product said it only stays good up until 4 months, but it turned amber after 4 weeks.  When you order and receive, product is already 10 days old.  I should have ordered 1 bottle at a time but it will be more expensive. One bottle, when used twice daily last about 3-4 weeks.  Thought I saved money, but 2 bottles spoiled by the time I finished the first one. I did notice a sligt difference on the tightness of my skin, but not the color of my skin.</li>
    <li> I tried one bottle to see if I liked it.  I can say that I did see improvement, So I bougth the buy 2 get one free.  I was worried that by the time I got to the third bottle, that it might not be good.  To my surprise,  the third bottle was a good as the first.  I do keep mine in the Fridg.  I&#x27;m using this with Vitamin E and A.  I have a lot of compiment on my skin,  I will continue to use this product</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product at a great price. I always buy 3 and share with family and friends. The picture shows an eyedropper but my serum actually had a pump which is great. The pump limits the air exposure to the product. My initial bottle stayed fresh for 3 months. It&#x27;s expiration date is tomorrow and it has not discolored. I feel that that my sun spots have lightened since I began using the product. I plan on continuing to order this awesome serum!</li>
    <li> I use this serum after derma rolling.  I also use it daily on face and around eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Definite results in skin and I like using an organic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bottle goes a long way if you are careful about application.</li>
    <li> Spend some money for no results. The product itself is yellowish in color, so once you apply it covers some of your skin discolorations, but when you wash next day there is no change. You need a higher concentration of product or a combo of different stuff if you really want the results. The bottom line is if you have sun damages and discoloration of any kind, those are way too weak to really make a difference.</li>
    <li> The previously purchased product was fine but since I have started using this bottle, my face has started breaking out.  This bottle of product does not smell the same as the first or look the same or feel the same on my skin.  I&#x27;m considering stopping use of the product and returning it.</li>
    <li> not a big fan - I don&#x27;t think it worked on my skin but maybe I am expecting too much!</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I used to buy the Obaji but it is just to expensive this is a great alternative.</li>
    <li> I just turned 40 but have been dealing with adult acne for the past 9 years. Discovered this product while watching someone&#x27;s YouTube videos about her acne regimens. My new doctor figured out that my acne is hormonal, my main problem is tough, bumpy skin that doesn&#x27;t seem to slough off well. I get those &#x27;tumor zits&#x27; because that tough skin doesn&#x27;t let stuff come out very easily (kind of like that &#x27;chicken skin&#x27; some of us get on the back of our arms). My skin is sensitive &amp; dry, most attempts at exfoliation cause irritation. Scrubs, salycidic acid, etc aren&#x27;t for me. THIS is amazing! My Dr prescribed Spironolactone which has an off-label use for hormonal acne similar to birth control pills. It took about 2 months to notice improvement, and my skin was red and peeled like crazy. I had a lot of red scarring and skin damage (thankfully, not pits), that&#x27;s why I was peeling. I use a Clarisonic to cleanse, this C serum (only mild sting for a quick second) followed up by a good moisturizer after the serum dries. My face feels like baby skin! Being able to successfully exfoliate has helped the healing process &amp; scars are fading. I&#x27;m sure it helps with sun damage and anti-aging too, which has only been a secondary concern for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality and freshness, excellent. I&#x27;ve reordered the 3 pack three times now without problems. I pop the little box in the butter keeper of my fridge as soon as it arrives &amp; keep it there until they&#x27;re used up. 3 enemies that cause vitamin C to oxidize quickly: heat, light, and air. Keeping my open bottle downstairs in the fridge is inconvenient. I solve this by filling a smaller bottle that I keep in my bathroom every 3-4 days. Blue or brown glass keeps the light out. Sometimes the dropper&#x27;s cap and the bottle&#x27;s rim will get crusty from dried product - wipe this off! It prevents a good seal &amp; allows air in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you refrigerate &amp; still have trouble with the 3 pack, contact the company. I&#x27;ve been so happy with their customer service, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d make it right with a refund or replacement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**An important point which isn&#x27;t mentioned by the company: This stuff will stain your whites! I&#x27;ve wiped my hands on a white towel and several hours later (due to oxidation) there are yellow-orange marks. Rinse your hands first! Take care with pillowcases, sheets, towels, &amp; clothing. Most stains come out with a little laundry pre-treatment. If you use this on your neck &amp; d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;, expect a bit of product transfer, even if you allow it to dry before dressing. **ce, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d make it right with a refund or replacement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**An important point which isn&#x27;t mentioned by the company: This stuff will stain your whites!

    <li> The strength of 20 % is the stongest I&#x27;ve found. I apply day and nite. Goes on easily. I&#x27;m just about out of my 2nd bottle. When I get 1/2 way thru the 3rd I&#x27;ll order again.  The thing I always think about is weather a produce is wking or would my skin look the same without it. Anyone have a logical answer????</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this products for several months and love it. The seller takes special care to package it well. Well enough to make a perfect gift as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for 5 years, I am 50 years old everyone tell me I am 30 years old.</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle, it is great! I will be ordering more to keep using. This is the only product I have purchased that you can see results in a couple of weeks. I am very satisfied</li>
    <li> I saw results right away.  My skins was tighter and clear.</li>
    <li> Good product at a great price.  I like the fact that it is freshly made. The instructions for application are precise and now I know much more about  Vit_C serums thanks to the education on the package.</li>
    <li> After running out of a pricey Obagi kit I was \\&quot;prescribed\\&quot; for skin damage, I found this product. I have been using it for maybe a year or so with better results than the Obagi kit. I use it at night almost seven days a week. The serum controls my acne and it has made my skin smoother. I really like this product because it does not seem to discolor or damage clothing or bedding like the benzoyl peroxide creams I&#x27;ve used in the past. It can sting a little but I personally don&#x27;t experience redness or any other irritation once I apply it.   This is a great product. No gimmicky, smelly lotions or attempts at posh marketing like a number of other skin treatments, just the product - simple and perfect.</li>
    <li> I am turning into healthier approach and among healthy eating and exercising articles I read about using a Vit Serum. I use this product foe a couple of months and I see a difference already my skin is soft and smooth and no more crazy breakouts. I really recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have use this product for a month and like it. My face does feel smooth. I showed it to my dermatologist. He said its a great antioxidant for my face but won&#x27;t repair damaged skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years now, and am very happy with it.  Living on the southwest Florida Gulf coast for 68 years has done its damage to my Celtic skin, so I need more than a drug store product.  The dermatologist recommends topically applied vitamin C, and this fills the bill at a fraction of the cost of other products.  It also has more vitamin C in it than the $100 products.  Besides being an effective part of daily facial skin regimen, it  speeds healing on cuts and dermatitis-related irritations.  I use it for the dings and nicks that come with keeping a house, especially on my hands.  The vendor is very responsive to questions, and got right back to me when I sought advice on using the product.  The 3-for the price of 2 is such a deal!  Do keep it in a wine cooler or some other cool place.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a less-costly C-serum to replace a serum I was buying from Image. The Image serum is good, but costly. I decided to give this one a try, and very happy I made the switch. It doesn&#x27;t have the viscosity of the Image serum--feels like water. It does tingle a little when I first applied it. I wondered if it was doing anything, but noticeable smoothness and better texture on my skin in 2-3 weeks. I don&#x27;t have acne-prone skin or difficult skin--but I&#x27;m outside a lot on my bike. I&#x27;d like to try the other formula for whitening + C--wish it was a little lower in price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d rather make my own vitamin C serum than wasting money on this. Feels like diluted lime water. Doesnt make my skin smooth or fairer.</li>
    <li> Ordered this because of the percentage of vitamin C. Recommended percentage by dermatologist on Dr. Oz. Make sure you follow directions about emptying air out of syringe before putting back in bottle. I have noticed a difference in age spots over time. Do not expect total erasing of wrinkles and dark spots.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a serum to go along with my needling. I haven’t kept up with the needling but I still use this everyday.  It made my skin peel the first time I used it and you can feel your skin tighten immediately. I am buying more to give to the women in my family.</li>
    <li> This is very good for aging skin.  It helps shrink your pores and goes on easily and dries quickly.  I use it morning and night.</li>
    <li> Its like water! This isnt worth the money! Dont waste your time on this product! Its expensive and i should send it back, i just havent had the time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since October 2012, and my friends have noticed that my skin texture looks younger, I have to give the credit to the Vitamin C serum!  Great stuff and an affordable price!</li>
    <li> First time I ordered from this company.  Freshly made, according to the label date as others reviewed.  Absorbs very quickly and has really made my skin soft.</li>
    <li> This is a good product with good quality. And the price is reasonable too !!! It is made with fresh.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Pure Vitamin C product that is made in Spain for about 2 yrs. now, and recently have been unable to find it ANYwhere. I had purchased them previously through Amazon, after discovering it at Marshall&#x27;s Dept. Store. Anyway....I thought, through the reviews, that I would give this one a try. It is like a bottle of water! What a mess!!!! With the first \\&quot;messy\\&quot; application, it had a bit of a tingley sensation, but after that...NOTHING...in every sense of the word! I am 50 years old, have very good skin already, and I am VERY fussy about what goes on my face, without having to spend hundreds of $$$. Will NOT purchase this again!</li>
    <li> My skin can&#x27;t live without this stuff and I love the little box it comes in. I use it for storeage to keep my C20 fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Thank  you,&lt;br /&gt;Mary Hutchinson</li>
    <li> This vitamin C serum is the best I have ever used. My face tingles after I have washed my face, used a hyluronic acid and then applied the C20 serum afterwards.  My face has a tightening afterwards. Love this stuff. I got a compliment today on how good I looked, have not heard a compliment like that for a very long time. I noticed a smoothing of my skin with a healthy glow. The price is awesome as well.  Shipping is quick too. Great company to deal with.</li>
    <li> Love this product ! I can feel the difference already and  very happy with it. The 3-for the price of 2 is such a deal!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t do without it. It clears me up and give my skin an amazing glow and an even, refreshed look. I have oily, dehydrated, acne prone and sensitive skin. I does burn upon application, especially if you exfoliate your skin prior, but it goes away in a few minutes. I put it once or twice a week on clean face and neck, then hyaluronic acid serum and moisturizing cream, after that I wake up with clearer, brighter and even colored skin.</li>
    <li> Total waste of money!  I have been using vitamin C serums for 10+ years and I know what it is...this stuff is clear, no scent whatsoever, and to me is probably really just plain WATER!!  I&#x27;m tempted to taste it...seriously don&#x27;t waste your money on this crap like I did.</li>
    <li> I use this every day after washing my face. It makes my skin very soft, after a week of use I do see a noticeable difference. My skin is smoother, fuller and my lines are seemingly diminishing! Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I thought I would give this product some time before I wrote a review; I am now on my second bottle.  Yes, I do notice a difference in my skin.  It is softer and small lines are diminishing.  Since I love the way my skin feels and looks, I will continue to use this Vitamin C serum.&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned about using vitamin c because I have be diagnosed with rosacea, but it did not affect it adversely.  Quite the contrary.  The redness has been greatly reduced and no major break outs.&lt;br /&gt;Some have commented that the product is watery.  For myself, I don&#x27;t see how that makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I just put a little in the palm of my hand and use the fingertips of the opposite hand to apply near my eyes and around my lips.  Then I add more to my palm, put my hands together and slather my face and neck.  The excess that&#x27;s left on my palms, I rub on the backs of my hands.  And yes,  the age spots are fading.  So that&#x27;s a plus.&lt;br /&gt;Do handle it carefully.  Put the top on and keep it away from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;For those who tend not to read instructions, express all of the air from the dropper; then put it back in the bottle.  The less this product is exposed to the air; the better.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it.  Use it.  Enjoy the results.</li>
    <li> what a combo doesn&#x27;t cost a lot works and arrives in timely fashion.  how much more do you want&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;/</li>
    <li> This product is great and at a terrific price, I will continue to order this item and will highly recommend it to anyone.  It works!!!! But, be careful, they are right when they say that this product should not be expposed to sun or air, if you can help it!</li>
    <li> I like the service which they gave me,but I do not know the result of it yet!  I have used it for month and haven&#x27;t got any good result yet.  I will keep using it for three months and review it again!</li>
    <li> It works to build collegen.  I know because people keep complimenting me about my facial skin. I also use it on the top of my hands and it has decreased the raised brown spots that I hate.  Spots are no longer raised and all spots on hands are definately lighter.  Don&#x27;t know yet if they will go away entirely.  I use twice a day.</li>
    <li> I have used other serums, this one doesn&#x27;t seem to do have the right concentration, i thought the price was good and would try another brand, no results will go back to obagi</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used more expensive brands and I think this works as well.  But I will say this seems more sensitive to light and air than the more expensive products.  I use it generously on my face, neck and arms, so price point is very important to me, that&#x27;s why I gave it five stars.  Be sure to follow the directions about dispensing from dropper, and keep unused bottles in refrig.  And use the product daily and generously, before it oxidizes.  I heard dermatologists on t.v. say it was the single best thing one can use on their skin, and they weren&#x27;t kidding.</li>
    <li> This makes my breakouts fade really fast. When I have broken skin, I apply it frequently and it heals VERY quickly. I think it also helps my skin&#x27;s overall condition.</li>
    <li> I have been using for a couple of weeks but I&#x27;m not sure if its doing as well as I expected. No firming or tightening. My skin does seem somewhat smoother.  I don&#x27;t have problems with wrinkles even though I&#x27;m 56. Been using some other fantastic products, so I was looking for something that would tighten, firm and decrease pore size. I will keep using, hoping for more results.  Will report back in about a month</li>
    <li> I had ordered this product accidentally.  I wanted the C20+Ferulic Acid.  I opened one of the bottles and decided not to keep it.  Upon returning the bottles I only received a partial credit.  I contacted the company because I expected a full credit.  I learned that it was against their policy to issue credit on the multiple bottle orders.  Regardless, they worked with me and ended up sending me what I originally meant to order.  As good customer service is so difficult to come by these days, I was very pleased with theirs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30s and my skin started looking dull. I have been using this stuff morning and evening for a year now, and I can say within the first month I could see a great difference in my skin. People say I have amazing skin for my age. It really makes it even toned and fresh. I use it instead of vitamin A/ Retinol which is more harsh on skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I always by the three bottles together. I just keep them all in the fridge so they don&#x27;t go bad.</li>
    <li> As an Esthetician Vit C is vital for your skin.. Great product I use it as we&#x27;ll as my clients</li>
    <li> Have been using C20 for 3 weeks, once a day, can see an improvement in my skin.  I have told family and friends about your product and will definitely keep using it!!  Thank you NuFountain  :)</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product and I can see and feel the difference already. I would order again</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been using the vitamin C for some time now and  I just love it! I will  continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product just give it time to work.  It helps fade brown spots and plumps your skin with continuous use. People think I am 10 years younger.  You do have to use sunscreen to help keep the brown spots away!</li>
    <li> I really like how the manufacturer adds instructions on how to use the product.  It does go bad after about a month, so you have to use it 2x&#x27;s day to get your money&#x27;s worth.  I definitely feel my skin is tighter than before using this product.  Definitely will continue buying and using it in my daily facial routine!</li>
    <li> It makes your skin glow!  I cup it in my hands and splatter it all over my face and I think I actually grew a new line of hair along my hairline!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about 2-3 months now and I can say I have seen a great improvement in my skin. I have semi-oily/combination/acne prone skin and this serum has smoothed the texture and faded old discolored acne scars. My facial complexion has become brighter, smooth to the touch and visibly even. I still have trouble with some areas of hyper pigmentation but with continued use I&#x27;m sure these will fade as much as other areas. I really wish I had taken before and after shots as I have had a tough time with my skin. The consistency of this serum is a bit annoying - it is water-like and not thick at all. When applying you must be careful not to waste any. The box comes with application instructions/guidelines. I would say 1 bottle lasts for about 3-4 weeks when applied twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Important* When using this product be sure to let it dry before applying any moisturizer for the best results! Also, look into purchasing an SPF to ensure the dark spots are well protected and will not reappear. Be sure to keep the vials in a cool and dark place so the serum doesn&#x27;t spoil.</li>
    <li> I was concerned about buying 3 at one time as the 1st bottle that I ordered turned yellow about half way through.  After reading one reivew, about ordering 1 at a time due to going bad and wasting a bottle and a half, I decided to go that route.  I like the product and the results, but hate the fact that it turns bad so soon.  I&#x27;m going to give it another try but only will purchase 1 bottle.</li>
    <li> Why would anybody want to spend more through another Manufacturer?  I use NuFountain’s 20% L-ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) and think it’s a great buy.  I keep it in my refrigerator since it needs to remain cool and instead of putting it into the palm of my hands; I put it into a small glass bowl and use my fingers to apply it.  This way it doesn’t seep through my fingers and nothing gets wasted.  If the consistency is different in other products, it just means that the other products have additives to change the consistency; it does not necessarily mean it will improve your skin any better.  In addition, L-ascorbic acid takes a long time, usually months to improve the skin.  A tip to improve the effectiveness of L-ascorbic acid is to exfoliate for you face and neck first.</li>
    <li> This was just as described. Freshly made . Seems to exactly what it stated. Recommend this to all. Make a great gift!</li>
    <li> I will be using this for the rest of my life. I saw a total difference on the complexion of my face. Great find and great price!</li>
    <li> with a product like this, more time is required to determin effectiveness than the three weeks used.  It does go on smoothly, seems to spread easily, and at times gives a refreshing tingle to the applied area.</li>
    <li> I liked the product but was a bit dismayed at how watery it was.  The product descripition did say it was water based but by calling it a serum in my mind I was expecting it to be more of a serum than it was.  It is tricky to apply because it is so watery and if it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that my eye stung badly after accidently getting some in one of them, I was beginning to wonder if it was just water and nothing else.  The price was great and I am continuing to use it and store the 2 extra bottles in the fridge as suggested.</li>
    <li> i use vit c serum all the time.. for years....this is a great product and the  best price, i&#x27;ve reordered from this company a few times...</li>
    <li> First of all, the product was delivered prompt and in good condition.  I am 46 years old and am seeing the signs of aging.  I have tried a hundred different products, but nothing to write home about.  I can actually say that I saw a difference in my skin within 2 days of using this product.  I had a dry patch that it didn&#x27;t matter how much daily moisturizer I used, it remained, but was all off a sudden gone.  I have been using the products now for a week and I can notice a few changes..one, my overall complexion looks smooth and even toned...two, I have noticed that my neck is looking tighter.  So far so good...I finally feel like I have a chance against the battle of aging.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the improvements after a few months.  I will update when I have finished my 3 bottles.  Ladies this is the real deal and I so happy to have found this product with a great price.</li>
