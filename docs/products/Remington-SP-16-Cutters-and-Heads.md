      <li>Excellent replacement cutters/heads for my Remington shaver.</li>
      <li>I found the replacement sp-16 to be the best price found.</li>
      <li>Works great!  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s great but the problem turns out to be not the cutters but the removable housing which holds the foil and the cutters.</li>
      <li>Been using this set for maybe 4 years now, perfect fit and function.</li>
      <li>very satisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with the products durability</li>

      <li>Very pleased to be able to order a new head for my husband&#x27;s favorite shaver</li>
      <li>Changed it easily.</li>
      <li>quick ship - works</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>delivery was right on schedule.  </li>
      <li>These were the right ones.</li>
      <li>I think the new ones on a new unit are better but worth it to replace when needed.  </li>
      <li>This company was VERY reasonable with prices on both the blades AND the shipping.</li>
      <li>the instructions say to pull the head out of the casing from the inside, but you&#x27;ll have better luck pushing it out from outside the casing.  </li>
      <li>exactly what my husband was looking for.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>Glad we could find a replacement part for such an old razor!</li>
      <li>Bought this for my boyfriends who has had his Remington 85 for over 10yrs &amp; with these new heads, he says it feels like it&#x27;s a brand new shaver!!</li>
      <li>Fast delivery, saved on having to buy a new shaver.</li>
      <li>My husband needed new blades for an older shaver.</li>
      <li>They were new, still in the package.</li>
      <li>my electric shaver seems like new now.</li>
      <li>Does not cut as well as my old 1</li>
      <li>If only I hadn&#x27;t waited more than a few years to replace the old ones, then my daily shaving experience would have been smoother, sooner.</li>

<li> I have a bad habit of not cleaning my razor as often as I should, but they keep on cutting.</li>

    <li> Does not cut as well as my old 1</li>
    <li> I ordered and recieved in record time.  That&#x27;s great but the problem turns out to be not the cutters but the removable housing which holds the foil and the cutters. The housing is the part that the part I bought screws into.  Where do I get the other part?</li>
    <li> Easy to install, works perfectly and gives a nice clean, close shave. Bought this for my boyfriends who has had his Remington 85 for over 10yrs &amp; with these new heads, he says it feels like it&#x27;s a brand new shaver!! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> what can i say, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to. my electric shaver seems like new now.</li>
    <li> I found the replacement sp-16 to be the best price found. This is the third replacement head in 8 years. The razor keeps on working.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> quick ship - works ok . . . . . etc . . . . etc  . . . . . etc . . . etc. . . . etc . . . .</li>

    <li> Received blades 2 days after I ordered them! They were new, still in the package. I looked everywhere for months and only found them at a couple of department stores but they were so expensive there that I might as well have bought a new razor! This company was VERY reasonable with prices on both the blades AND the shipping. I will definately order from them again!</li>
    <li> Very pleased to be able to order a new head for my husband&#x27;s favorite shaver</li>
