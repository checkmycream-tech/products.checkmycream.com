### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>this is the best for peopple who have to use hair system.</li>
      <li>Will continue to by from this vendor as the price seems to be the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>Great product for lace units!!</li>
      <li>Great product,</li>
      <li>This works great.</li>
      <li>This is a good bonding agent if you plan on wearing your unit for 1-2 days.  </li>
      <li>extremely good product.</li>
      <li>so it was very important to me that this glue adhere to my head and not shine</li>
      <li>Love this product it holds for two weeks some time even more.</li>
      <li>Love It.</li>
      <li>But if you use it with a combonation with another adhesive it makes the vapon more manageable.</li>
      <li>Great product, I would recommend it to any one suffering complete hair loss.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s best if you keep the tube upright &amp; cap it tightly</li>
      <li>Works very well, easy to use and easy to clean up.</li>
      <li>For a long time hold this is the best adhesive I have tried thus far.</li>
      <li>Clumpy if not applied right</li>
      <li>oh, i did notice when i first started to apply the vapon</li>
      <li>In general, gets the job done and has a fairly good hold in a dry environment.  </li>
      <li>However I wouldn&#x27;t advise using it if you live in hot hot areas.</li>
      <li>When the unit slips, the glue remains very tacky around the area, so your hair sticks to the areas (ruining the unit).  </li>
      <li>When I have used another it has been really dissappoting.</li>
      <li>If you want something that works really well, try the Lace Wig Tape.  </li>
      <li>But I am open If there&#x27;s someone who can recommend somethinf better I am open for it.</li>
      <li>Once the wig is removed, you may just need to spray a little more lace release on any remaining tape that is still attached to the wig or hair.  </li>
      <li>Spray a little more, wait and repeat until the wig has been removed.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I might give it a try in the future, but for now the no tape works very well for me.</li>
      <li>its not strong enough to hold my system in place, but its ok.</li>
      <li>I have Alopecia, and I apply it to the welts of hair, to cover the top of my head, can be a little irritating to the scalp sometimes, but if you use a skin protectant, you will be fine.</li>
      <li>not a strong holding power in hot weather so don&#x27;t count so much on it.</li>
      <li>vapon no tape is not a bad product , but the instruction say to give it 25 minutes to dry, and it seem to be dry</li>
      <li>It is double-sided tape, clear - once you remove the blue paper backing.  </li>
      <li>I was so fustrated that I just threw the entire wig and mess right in the trash.  </li>
      <li>If it is summer, or you live in a hot area, this is not a good adhesive.  </li>

<li> so you have to be careful when using it.</li>
<li> Removing the glue from the closure to start fresh while it was still on my head was difficult.</li>
<li> All other adhesives seem to irritate my skin and the unit has to be removed before time.</li>
<li> It is a little loose</li>

<li> A sticky, ineffective, disgusting mess.  </li>
<li> Your lace wig will slip and move :(</li>

    <li> For a long time hold this is the best adhesive I have tried thus far. Clumpy if not applied right but it will definitely hold. Would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Great product, I would recommend it to any one suffering complete hair loss. It&#x27;s not the easiest thing to use, but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s a snap. I have Alopecia, and I apply it to the welts of hair, to cover the top of my head, can be a little irritating to the scalp sometimes, but if you use a skin protectant, you will be fine. I search the web all the time, to find another product. Recently I found another adhesive, but I have never tried it. I believe it&#x27;s by walker. I might give it a try in the future, but for now the no tape works very well for me. But I am open If there&#x27;s someone who can recommend somethinf better I am open for it.</li>
    <li> This is a good bonding agent if you plan on wearing your unit for 1-2 days.  If it is summer, or you live in a hot area, this is not a good adhesive.  The wig will shift and slip.  When the unit slips, the glue remains very tacky around the area, so your hair sticks to the areas (ruining the unit).  I&#x27;ve had to reapply my hair 3 times this week.  Also, this can be considered difficult to work with as the glue is not very viscous (a bit runny) and it drips and runs when too much is applied.</li>
    <li> In general, gets the job done and has a fairly good hold in a dry environment.  Can be a bit messy, but that usually occurs when trying to do touch-ups &amp;#34;too quickly&amp;#34;.  Will continue to by from this vendor as the price seems to be the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> Works very well, easy to use and easy to clean up.</li>
    <li> This is the worst adhesive that I have ever tried. I have worn wigs my entire life.  This was very difficult to remove from my wig, and it didn&#x27;t even bond very well to my head. I was so fustrated that I just threw the entire wig and mess right in the trash.  If you want something that works really well, try the Lace Wig Tape.  It is double-sided tape, clear - once you remove the blue paper backing.  I can use this and the wig will stay on for a week. I remove it using Lace Release. This works great. All you have to do is spray the Lace Release on the taped areas, wait about a minute and then slowly lift up on the hair. Spray a little more, wait and repeat until the wig has been removed. Once the wig is removed, you may just need to spray a little more lace release on any remaining tape that is still attached to the wig or hair.  Wait a minute and slide the glued section of the wig against a mirror.  This will release the taped residue without damaging the wig or the hair.  Love It.</li>

    <li> A sticky, ineffective, disgusting mess.  My hair piece started to slide around on my head after only a day of wear.  Everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different, so it may work for you.  But I&#x27;m sticking to the tapes instead.</li>
    <li> Great product, but it&#x27;s best if you keep the tube upright &amp; cap it tightly</li>
    <li> Misunderstood the description - thought it included the applicator. Returning item to order the 1/2 oz size which does.</li>
    <li> its not strong enough to hold my system in place, but its ok.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a long time and I have always been satisfaced. When I have used another it has been really dissappoting. Trust me this is the best for peopple who have to use hair system.</li>
    <li> Great product for lace units!!</li>
    <li> vapon no tape is not a bad product , but the instruction say to give it 25 minutes to dry, and it seem to be dry yet it did not fully stick i was not sure when to apply my lace wig , i had to do alot of touch up and the product is a little thick and messy so you have to be careful applying it. oh, i did notice when i first started to apply the vapon no tape i  put it on too thickly and it looked white in color , so again , be careful.</li>
    <li> Not to bad, does not hold as long as Stated though.</li>
    <li> After reading some of the reviews I decided to try this. I have alopecia so it was very important to me that this glue adhere to my head and not shine, well I got part of that, it adhered but it left a shine. It is a little loose so you have to be careful when using it. For me it&#x27;s lasted about 8 days before I pull it up and reapply the glue. If there was no shine this would have gotten 5 stars. I put glue on the closure and my head and let sit for about 30-40 seconds, then pressed the closure to my head. I also used the blow dryer to ensure it adhered. Removing the glue from the closure to start fresh while it was still on my head was difficult. Still trying to find something that works in removing the glue residue from the hair. Any suggestions please let me know. I hope this helps, ladies.</li>
    <li> extremely good product. Little pricey.. but it works well. I will continue to order as long as I need it</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this is the only product that I can use. All other adhesives seem to irritate my skin and the unit has to be removed before time.</li>
    <li> Love this product it holds for two weeks some time even more. will by again</li>
    <li> not a strong holding power in hot weather so don&#x27;t count so much on it. i only use it at the tip of my part so i can just press on it when it lifts a bit.</li>
