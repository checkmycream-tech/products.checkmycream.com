      <li>One of those purchases I&#x27;m glad I made.</li>
      <li>i had to use longer screws to make sure it didn&#x27;t fall off my wall.</li>
      <li>I placed the adjustable hole on the top and bottom and centered the brackets before installing screws on the bottom of both brackets.</li>

      <li>Cheaply built.</li>
      <li>Made of great material and will be bought by us again when we get going on our second bathroom!</li>
      <li>Great solution for small bathroom.</li>
      <li>Using the marked stud as a guide I mounted them securely (overly so) using #9 X 2 1/2 deck screws to the stud.</li>
      <li>Love the look of these towel bars...but they definitely need to work on installation hardware.  </li>
      <li>Be aware.....</li>
      <li>Took a little tweaking to get it properly mounted but very sturdy, nice looking and affords great towel space next to a powder room sink.</li>

      <li>I have a small bathroom and this &amp;#34;fit the bill&amp;#34; nicely.</li>
      <li>it looks nice but too small for my bath towels.</li>
      <li>To install the rack just place over the newly installed brackets by placing over these brackets and then tighten both straight blade screws.</li>
      <li>So if you need instructions and can&#x27;t read Chinese, better not order or get a Chinese translator.</li>
      <li>Nice looking product but very small.</li>
      <li>It was easily installed in 30 minutes or less.</li>
      <li>Using a stud finder I found the correct location near the shower stall.</li>
      <li>Smaller than I&#x27;d hoped but if you fold your bath towels in half its great for a small bathroom</li>
      <li>With no instructions it was easy to see that the two wall brackets are held into the rack for shipping by the upper and lower small straight blade screws that need to be removed.</li>
      <li>This is not big enough to hold normal bath towels and the screws to mount on the wall are NOT included</li>
      <li>not a single instruction or template included!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great solution for small bathroom. One of those purchases I&#x27;m glad I made. The hook on the end is also handy.  When not in use it wings flush against wall. It was easily installed in 30 minutes or less.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I&#x27;d hoped but if you fold your bath towels in half its great for a small bathroom</li>
    <li> Cheaply built. Hard to hang fixture to mounting plates. Would not recommend to a friend, simply put threw mine away.</li>
    <li> Love the look of these towel bars...but they definitely need to work on installation hardware.  Hard to hang and hope it stays up.&lt;br /&gt;Also no instructions, all paperwork was in Chinese.  So if you need instructions and can&#x27;t read Chinese, better not order or get a Chinese translator.</li>
    <li> Took a little tweaking to get it properly mounted but very sturdy, nice looking and affords great towel space next to a powder room sink.</li>
    <li> In work as I am writing this review and working fine.</li>
    <li> Easy install and works great.</li>
    <li> Be aware.....only for small towels, like kitchen towels. good quality though</li>
    <li> Attachments are not very secure. The rack itself has held up OK.</li>
    <li> I bought this to hang wet pool towels in my screen room.  I wondered if it would be sturdy enough for four wet towels.  Well, it is!  And the hook on the bottom is great for my sun visor and goggles.  It was also easy enough for a non-mechanically-inclined person (me!) to install.  I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Sturdy, attractive, we love it.</li>
    <li> Wife wanted a towel rack installed but any 24 inch one usually measures around 26 inches total. Since there was not enough room I found this neat one that holds four towels plus a hook at the bottom, and folds to the wall. Using a stud finder I found the correct location near the shower stall. With no instructions it was easy to see that the two wall brackets are held into the rack for shipping by the upper and lower small straight blade screws that need to be removed. Using the marked stud as a guide I mounted them securely (overly so) using #9 X 2 1/2 deck screws to the stud. I found that the measurement needed is 7 ½ inch between the top center bracket hole and the lower center bracket top hole. I placed the adjustable hole on the top and bottom and centered the brackets before installing screws on the bottom of both brackets. To install the rack just place over the newly installed brackets by placing over these brackets and then tighten both straight blade screws.</li>
    <li> was not what I ordered was made by some other company Yicheng sanitary ware, was a piece of crap plastic not stainless steel would not hold a full bath towel. would not recommend</li>
    <li> This is not big enough to hold normal bath towels and the screws to mount on the wall are NOT included</li>
    <li> This is a very sturdy easy to install product that we love! Made of great material and will be bought by us again when we get going on our second bathroom!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t sustain enough weight (big soaked towel for example) so I have to return it</li>
    <li> not happy with this item...cannot fit bath towels on it which is why I purchased it and very difficult to get it to stay on the wall.  It keeps coming loose and falling down.  Not recommended unless you just want to use it for hand towels or wash cloths</li>
    <li> Nice looking product but very small. Will only fit hand towels</li>
    <li> These are sturdy and easy to install. I came up with the genius idea to use them to hang clothing in my laundry room. They easily fold back to the wall when I am done drying my clothes.  I was tired of using the wooden laundry dryer in the middle of the room. I am very happy with my purchases. I bought two and they work perfectly for my intentions.</li>
    <li> Looks like chrome easy install</li>
    <li> Very good for my bathroom towels.</li>
    <li> I have a small bathroom and this &amp;#34;fit the bill&amp;#34; nicely. Heavy duty and the best is you can move it out of the way when not in use!</li>
    <li> not a single instruction or template included! i had to use longer screws to make sure it didn&#x27;t fall off my wall. it looks nice but too small for my bath towels.</li>
    <li> sturdy unit, easy install, woks great!</li>
    <li> These are really nicely made.  They are a great alternative to a double bar and look very nice when hung.</li>
