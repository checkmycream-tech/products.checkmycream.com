      <li>It leaves the hair manageable and with a pleasant shine.</li>
      <li>good product, good price,  I would recommend this product to anyone that would like to add some control to their hair.</li>
      <li>A good product.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s nice in the hair and does a great job of moisturizing and conditioning.</li>
      <li>Great stuff, had gone to many drugstores looking for it wasting gas and time.</li>
      <li>My wife,is very satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>love it!</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Am grateful this product has remained on the market for so many years - have never found a substitute for it!</li>
      <li>Hair Nice</li>
      <li>This works perfectly with my natural curly hair</li>
      <li>I have always liked - used it for many years.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as good as the original Vitapointe, but acceptable.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair look fantastic!</li>
      <li>yes, although the company has changed hands (no longer Clairol), it&#x27;s still works better than any of the many hair products on the market.</li>
      <li>THIS IS A DISCONTINUED PRODUCT THAT I HAVE USED FOR MANY MANY YEARS.  </li>
      <li>An oldie but a goody :)</li>
      <li>This change is not for the better although the product is still  acceptable.  </li>
      <li>Vitapointe is 100% oil just whipped up with air, compared to many hairdress cremes that are a mixture of oil and water.  </li>
      <li>Vitapointe has been around for more than 40 years.  </li>
      <li>We have used this product for many years.  </li>
      <li>Often times the tried and true is better than experimentation!</li>
      <li>We need more if it is available.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very effective at providing a nice sheen and eliminating the dry, fly-away aspect to her hair.</li>
      <li>This hair creme is the only thing that makes my hair look beautiful every day.  </li>
      <li>Super stuff!</li>
      <li>Luckily, I was able to purchase this item on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Light, not too oily.</li>
      <li>I love the convenient large size because it is cheaper in the end and don&#x27;t have to order as often.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again, but it&#x27;s not a bad product in any way.</li>
      <li>Love love loved it, used it back in the day, rediscovered it last month,</li>
      <li>Have used this product for many years , but company was sold and new owner has changed formula without obvious  reason or explanation to many loyal users.  </li>
      <li>I would never recommend this for people with oily hair, or people with European very fine hair.  </li>
      <li>This was just what my hair needed to get back to those natural curls I once loved.</li>
      <li>Very light and nongreasy, and gives my hair a terrific shine.</li>
      <li>and I am on my first.</li>
      <li>Yes, this product has changed in appearance and seems oilier, but it still revitalizes my hair like no other product available in stores.  </li>
      <li>I always get positive remarks about the sheen in my hair.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without it!!</li>
      <li>Vita point is a light cream hairdress that also provides a little volume to those with fine hair.  </li>
      <li>And I can fine it only at amazon.i</li>
      <li>I was looking for a product with more of a moisturizer finish as i have very dry</li>
      <li>Several years ago I used this - it was a light creamy hair dressing.  </li>
      <li>Works very well for my husband</li>
      <li>have been using it for years, much better thank any other product.</li>
      <li>Bring back the original formula.</li>
      <li>New formula seems to be more like a hair wax then a grease less cream.  </li>
      <li>look and don&#x27;t feel I need to add any other product to achieve a satisfying finish to my daily</li>
      <li>Started with this product when a teenager with naturally blond hair.  </li>
      <li>Seems to be like the original, although it is a little mushy.</li>
      <li>this was hard to fine beenusing</li>
      <li>If you have hair that &amp;#34;reverts&amp;#34; back to its original state when it encounters humid conditions, like my African-American hair, a little bit of this will help.</li>
      <li>Not up to old standard.  </li>
      <li>Use sooooo little and it does so much!</li>

<li> Use sooooo little and it does so much!</li>
<li> So after years I went back to use it when I went all natural with my multi-racial hair (Black included).</li>
<li> I purchased three jars of this product that will last me a long time.  </li>
<li> Since using it again my hair is no longer dry and flat, but has a sheen and is fuller than before.</li>
<li> Have used it for a long time.  </li>
<li> You get what you want and in the long run it is cheaper.</li>
<li> I used this product when I was younger, but as I got older the oil seemed to not agree with my skin, nothing serious.</li>
<li> I have used Vitapointe for years for my dry, stubborn grey hair.  </li>
<li> With age the hair starts to become dry and brittle.</li>
<li> I am not sure when this product changed, but it is not the same as when it was Clairol Vitapointe.  </li>
<li> This is thick hand lotion which will gum up your hair if you try to use it as a daily hairdress.  </li>
<li> Vitapointe should be consider a specialty hair creme, helpful to only those with thick hair.  </li>
<li> since I was a little girl ilove</li>
<li> just before I set my hair when a little moisture helps.</li>
<li> This product  seemed way past its &#x27;Due date&#x27; when compared to a retail purchase.</li>
<li> I was led to believe that this was the same product but was annoyingly disappointed to open the jar and find this similar looking paste.</li>
<li> Use just a touch because it is really heavy.  </li>
<li> I used vita point 20 years ago and somehow got detoured by other products that were not nearly as good as vita point.  </li>
<li> I have used this product for the past 20 years and</li>
<li> Consequently, my wife has been using this hair dressing for the past decade.&lt;br</li>
<li> I have used this product for years and recently was unable to find it anywhere.  </li>
<li> Now, it is heavy, thick</li>

    <li> My only hair product for years. Light, not too oily. Only takes a dab before blow drying to prevent breakage from the heat.</li>
    <li> Several years ago I used this - it was a light creamy hair dressing.  Not so anymore.  Now, it is heavy, thick and I swear just like Crisco cooking fat.  Bring back the original formula.</li>
    <li> great service and great product</li>
    <li> Great stuff, had gone to many drugstores looking for it wasting gas and time. Ordered on Amazon. Got it in a couple of days. You get what you want and in the long run it is cheaper.</li>
    <li> We have used this product for many years.  My husband uses it faithfully.  We need more if it is available.</li>

An oldie but a goody :)</li>
    <li> Have used it for a long time.  Started with this product when a teenager with naturally blond hair.  It gives a luster to the hair without a greasy shine look.  Now it does as well with my &amp;#34;graying&amp;#34; look and don&#x27;t feel I need to add any other product to achieve a satisfying finish to my daily shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Am grateful this product has remained on the market for so many years - have never found a substitute for it!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product with more of a moisturizer finish as i have very dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;I bought 3 bottles and I am on my first.Daily i am learning to appreciate it.&lt;br /&gt;Prompt delivery.</li>

    <li> Super stuff! My husband loves it!</li>
    <li> bought it for my MOM and if she loves it thats all that matters, so get it for your MOM....</li>
    <li> this was hard to fine beenusing since I was a little girl ilove the way feels on my hair me greasy feeling</li>
    <li> Love love loved it, used it back in the day, rediscovered it last month, great conditioner</li>
    <li> been using this for over 1p years. love it!</li>
    <li> The scent takes getting used to. I jokingly call it &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; fragrance. But it&#x27;s nice in the hair and does a great job of moisturizing and conditioning. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again, but it&#x27;s not a bad product in any way.</li>
    <li> I have always liked - used it for many years.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT MET ALL MY EXPECTATIONS</li>
    <li> have been using it for years, much better thank any other product.</li>
    <li> Works very well for my husband</li>
    <li> I am not sure when this product changed, but it is not the same as when it was Clairol Vitapointe.  Just doesn&#x27;t seem or work the same.  I will not buy again.</li>

    <li> This is a very good product and meet all my needs for my hair, The shipping was excellent received it ahead of time.</li>
    <li> It was exactually what i wanted. A good product. I can always find what i need thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> Not up to old standard.  Different formula than clairol.  Whats up!!! Greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  It works for me.</li>
    <li> Yes, this product has changed in appearance and seems oilier, but it still revitalizes my hair like no other product available in stores.  I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This product  seemed way past its &#x27;Due date&#x27; when compared to a retail purchase.</li>
    <li> Vitapointe has been around for more than 40 years.  I used it as a teenager and it has not changed.  Vitapointe is 100% oil just whipped up with air, compared to many hairdress cremes that are a mixture of oil and water.  If you have hair that &amp;#34;reverts&amp;#34; back to its original state when it encounters humid conditions, like my African-American hair, a little bit of this will help.

Good luck!</li>
    <li> This was used on my hair when I was younger and I now use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair. Love this product!</li>
    <li> i think the company was sold.  formula was changed.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the past 20 years and yes, although the company has changed hands (no longer Clairol), it&#x27;s still works better than any of the many hair products on the market.</li>

So, I was happy to see that I could order it in Amazon.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as good as the original Vitapointe, but acceptable.</li>
    <li> This works perfectly with my natural curly hair</li>
    <li> Moisturizes  your hair well.</li>
    <li> If you are used to using the Vitapointe daily hairdress \\&quot;Salon Formula\\&quot;...this is not it.  This is thick hand lotion which will gum up your hair if you try to use it as a daily hairdress.  The \\&quot;Salon Formula\\&quot; is a much lighter product which will not gum up your hair and is intended for daily application after you have washed your hair and towel dried.  I was led to believe that this was the same product but was annoyingly disappointed to open the jar and find this similar looking paste.</li>
    <li> I always get positive remarks about the sheen in my hair. Use sooooo little and it does so much! Best buy of 2014!</li>
    <li> I luv vita pointe. And I can fine it only at amazon.i give it a 5 rating</li>
    <li> I love the convenient large size because it is cheaper in the end and don&#x27;t have to order as often.</li>

    <li> THIS IS A DISCONTINUED PRODUCT THAT I HAVE USED FOR MANY MANY YEARS.  I MIGHT HAVE TO SWITCH AFTER THIS ONE IS GONE.</li>
    <li> Hair Nice, I have used this hair product for 25-30 years on my hair, keeps your hair glowing &amp; flawless and its nice not greasy at all, love it !</li>
    <li> Have used this product for many years , but company was sold and new owner has changed formula without obvious  reason or explanation to many loyal users.  New formula seems to be more like a hair wax then a grease less cream.  This change is not for the better although the product is still  acceptable.  Have to wonder if this version is cheaper to manufacturer !</li>
    <li> Very light and nongreasy, and gives my hair a terrific shine. Makes my hair look fantastic! I started using it over 25 years ago and I still keep coming back to it.</li>
    <li> good product, good price,  I would recommend this product to anyone that would like to add some control to their hair.</li>
    <li> This version leaves your hair greasy.</li>
    <li> Works great, just a dab is all you need.</li>
