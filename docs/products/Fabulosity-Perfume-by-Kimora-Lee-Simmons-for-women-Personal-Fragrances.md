      <li>I love this fragrance.</li>

      <li>It is a lovely, luscious girly scent, that is not at all offensive.</li>
      <li>I am in love with this  perfume</li>
      <li>Been wearing it for more than 8 years.</li>
      <li>This perfume has a lovely smell, and the price is a steal.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for a lovely scent, &amp; I was not disappointed at all!</li>

      <li>Don&#x27;t think its the real Fabulosity!</li>
      <li>I used to be able to smell it on my clothes the next day if it was on a sweater or something.  </li>
      <li>Really fast shipping as well.</li>
      <li>I also am fond of the shape of the bottle, it just looks really cute unlike some other purfumes.</li>
      <li>It is sweet smelling and has some faint coconut smell to it, but mostly I would say it is sweet and</li>
      <li>i just can live without .i</li>
      <li>The smell doesnt last as long as some from high end designers, but it is fine for a date or luncheon.</li>

    <li> I am in love with this  perfume i just can live without .i am soo ordering  another one this is my third  bottle this  year.i get soo many people telling  me which one it&#x27;s  when i tell do they can&#x27;t  believe it just sweet,delicious,soft  just  right</li>
    <li> Not my type pf perfume.....Just ok</li>
    <li> I fell in love with the perfume when I bought it on clearance almost a year ago.  Shortly after that it was discontinued and I have been hunting for it ever since.&lt;br /&gt;When I found it on Amazon I was elated and bought two bottles.&lt;br /&gt;Not only is it my favorite, it&#x27;s my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite as well.  The part I love the most about it is that it isn&#x27;t a floral smell, it&#x27;s more of a fruity smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume unsniffed, because I already owned baby phat goddess. I was hoping for a lovely scent, &amp; I was not disappointed at all! It is a lovely, luscious girly scent, that is not at all offensive. Do not be discouraged by the scent straight from the bottle, or the scent at first spray, which smell like really cheap champagne or beer. It only lasts a few seconds, then it turns into a very beautiful scent. Definitely recommend! :)</li>
    <li> This perfume has a lovely smell, and the price is a steal. The only problem is that the scent does not last long. But, it arrived on time and in great condition.</li>
    <li> Smells good and arrived before expected. :)</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. It is very light and smells wonderful. It is not overpowering. I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> For the price, it was nice but I personally wouldn&#x27;t get this for myself again, nice design and shape of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I got this because it was on sale.  It is a fragrane that is a bit girlish and not what I like.  It is sweet smelling and has some faint coconut smell to it, but mostly I would say it is sweet and that smell gives me a headache.  So I wont re buy this, I like a more romantic fragrance.</li>
    <li> Has a very rich elegant smell!</li>
    <li> My second best perfume. Been wearing it for more than 8 years.</li>
    <li> Made me sick. Don&#x27;t think its the real Fabulosity!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this perfume before and I&#x27;ve always loved it because it&#x27;s a sweet scent that lasts a long time. The price was great too. This is a must have.</li>
    <li> Beautiful packaging, and bottle. Smells soo delicious! Really fast shipping as well. I wish i had bought the bigger bottle, however the small one is a perfect, generous amount!</li>
    <li> Ive used this before and this one doent seen to last as long as my other bottle, like it has added water or alcohol.  I used to be able to smell it on my clothes the next day if it was on a sweater or something.  Dissapointed.  I have had no luck with perfume on amazon</li>
    <li> Everything was great. I love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for this product you arent going to find it any cheaper than this. I cant comment on the scent as that is obviously up to the individual taste. My wife loves it and this price is unbeatable!</li>
    <li> I have always loved Kimora&#x27;s perfumes. Got it as a give from my hubbie for Mothers Day!! Great buy arrived on time!! Will purchase again!!</li>
    <li> Is exactly what I wanted &amp; have been looking for  over a year now. Price outstanding &amp; glad I got 2 bottles at one time!</li>
    <li> It was not a quick arrival, but I was delighted when it did arrive!  This is an awesome price for such a wonderful fragrance!!!  I received a sample from ordering a perfume a long while back, and mom said it smelled wonderful on me!  I loved it, too, so it was definitely going to be something I&#x27;d eventually order.  I could not find it in department stores, so I decided to order it online (I believe a retail clerk once mentioned that they used to sell it at Sears or JCP, but I ran into a dead end trying to find it anywhere).  It would have been the best decision anyway given the great, online deal!!!</li>
    <li> I got this because I liked the bottle the smell not so much</li>
    <li> Great perfume everything as expected</li>
    <li> I purchased this scent for the first time about 4 years ago and I keep reordering it because the compliments don&#x27;t stop. It&#x27;s light, fun, and can be worn at any time of day. What more can you really ask for?</li>
