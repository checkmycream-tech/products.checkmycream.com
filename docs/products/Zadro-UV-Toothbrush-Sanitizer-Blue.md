      <li>Nowhere is safe.</li>
      <li>Would like to be able to sanitize scissors and nail instruments also</li>
      <li>I just bought a couple more for family members.</li>
      <li>I love this product, it´s</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s incredibly simple, and sometimes that&#x27;s the very best design.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite type of toothbrush sanitizer.  </li>
      <li>For the price there&#x27;s nothing better, and considering how cheap they are</li>
      <li>Though we can not see the if UV really does its job, the case is good for traveling for carrying tooth brush.</li>
      <li>It arrived fast and the light is awesome so you can tell it is shut properly, my toothbrush fits in it nicely as well</li>
      <li>easy to use.</li>
      <li>toothbrush fits easily.</li>
      <li>unit does stay upright, to drain from brushheads, when propped against something but will fall easily if the item it is propped on will move.  </li>
      <li>It is compact, easy to use and works well.  </li>
      <li>It will accommodate almost any manual toothbrush and easily accepted the brushing head of my electric one.</li>
      <li>It fits easily in my Dopp kit and is quite easy on batteries.  </li>
      <li>feel that my teehts are more clean now.</li>
      <li>He has used it every day for about a year and a half and it still works perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Hey, any method of getting a step ahead of germs is fine with me.</li>
      <li>But the light comes on and it appears to work just as advertised.  </li>
      <li>I think that just about any brush would fit in this case.</li>
      <li>UV light sterilizes water and surfaces.</li>
      <li>I always rinse my toothbrush after use, use a clean tissue to \\&quot;dry\\&quot; it and then place it in the case.  </li>
      <li>The best place to place this will be directly behind the sink at most hotels and in your bathroom as well if you want it to standup</li>
      <li>Loved this for myself, I don&#x27;t know if it actually works</li>
      <li>best way to tell if it works is to close the case in a dark room and make sure the blue UV light can be seen tru the case.  </li>
      <li>idea for sanitizing toothbrush quickly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;Batteries seem to last good amount of time.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Product arrived quickly and well-packed.</li>
      <li>packaged well and rec&#x27;d quickly.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, a pretty good case, and lasts long.</li>
      <li>brush has fresh taste.</li>
      <li>At this price point, I decided that, if it worked, it was worth twice the price.  </li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite sanitizer.</li>
      <li>not expensive.</li>
      <li>I have used it to sanitize a swimming pool and a hot tub in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If it dies, and I&#x27;m sure it will at some point, I can replace the entire thing for a pittance.</li>
      <li>It will cost more to send it back than to buy it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty neat.  </li>
      <li>, I cannot think of anything other than to reiterate that I love this product!</li>
      <li>He does not blot the brush first</li>
      <li>I was using other brands, but after reading good reviews about this particular brand, I gave it a try.</li>
      <li>There is a convenient little light on top to indicate when the batteries need replacing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lasted pretty long and seems to be one of the better made units.</li>
      <li>First is does not hold large toothbrushes.  </li>
      <li>while this product may clean the brushes which it does and removes the odors the inside portion is too small for many brands.</li>
      <li>I use this as a travel case and it works really well.</li>
      <li>Thanks a lot</li>
      <li>My toothbrush feels really clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Of course, I don&#x27;t know if it really cleans and disinfects.  </li>
      <li>the sanitizing light only shines on the brush.</li>
      <li>(the light comes on as expected) and it can&#x27;t hurt China tap water, so overall I&#x27;m satisfied and haven&#x27;t had any of the quality issues I&#x27;ve read others have encountered.  </li>
      <li>Does this product clean my toothbrush with that fancy blue light?&lt;br</li>
      <li>So far after about 8 months, I&#x27;m still on my first one.  </li>
      <li>I read quite a few reviews and didn&#x27;t find much about electric brushes fitting this product.</li>
      <li>I would highly advise getting rechargeable batteries and taking the batteries out after it gets done sanitizing.</li>
      <li>It is so useful and unexpensive at the same time.</li>
      <li>I live in Asia, so just returning a defective device doesn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
      <li>My case gets pretty regular use and is carried on every trip so not just sitting on the counter at home.</li>
      <li>The only problem I had with this was that the tooth brush did not dry out and had to make sure it was dry before putting into the case</li>
      <li>The little rubber piece that holds the brush seems to be sturdy and able to accomodate different size necks.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other toothbrush sanitizers which have worn out rather quickly.</li>
      <li>Inexpensive and has worked well so far.</li>
      <li>So far, this one has lasted longer than the others I have tried.</li>
      <li>If they are cooperative, I will order at least 2 more.</li>
      <li>The green LED light comes on, but it does not work.</li>
      <li>The green LED comes on but no ultra violet light comes on .</li>
      <li>This case gives me the confidence that my toothbrush is at least safe from the fecal spray of my toilet flush.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if other brands will work better as I&#x27;m afraid/</li>
      <li>, it might sound tedious but it really isn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>but if you&#x27;re looking for a cover for your toothbrush near a toilet and also a holster that can stand up to drain water</li>
      <li>Previous models of different cases ate up batteries at a fast rate.</li>
      <li>I believe this is due to the fact that one side becomes top heavy due to a rounded corner on opposite sides.  </li>

    <li> This does not work. The green LED comes on but no ultra violet light comes on . This does not sanitize as advertised.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it´s awesome, it really Works&lt;br /&gt;I feel that my teehts are more clean now. Thanks a lot</li>
    <li> The green LED light comes on, but it does not work. It will cost more to send it back than to buy it.</li>
    <li> Loved this for myself, I don&#x27;t know if it actually works but it was a great stocking stuffer for both my parents.  Especially for the peace of mind when they go on vacation.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and has worked well so far. Nice product!&lt;br /&gt;Good idea for sanitizing toothbrush quickly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;Batteries seem to last good amount of time.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a replacement for a portable sanitizer which stopped working. A very good replacement and holds my battery-operated toothbrush also.</li>
    <li> I received one of these Christmas 2010, and by July 2013 I was on my third one. I like the product but it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold up well. It wasn&#x27;t because of excess water (I don&#x27;t believe since I shake off my toothbrush), or because of dropping it. They simply stop working. For the price there&#x27;s nothing better, and considering how cheap they are I don&#x27;t have a problem with going thru one a year if need be.</li>
    <li> It is so useful and unexpensive at the same time. It protects my health, what else can you ask for an item?</li>
    <li> This thing is supposed to automatically shut off in 5 minutes after the case is closed. It goes on and stays on.. until the batteries are dead. Bad product in my experience.</li>
    <li> It does cover the toothbrush and makes for a good storage unit.  Due to my toothbrush head being tilted back from the body the brushes do not touch this unit when stored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not certain if the UV actually does anything but if you&#x27;re looking for a cover for your toothbrush near a toilet and also a holster that can stand up to drain water then this does the job while also serving as a good travel unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit does stay upright, to drain from brushheads, when propped against something but will fall easily if the item it is propped on will move.  I believe this is due to the fact that one side becomes top heavy due to a rounded corner on opposite sides.  The best place to place this will be directly behind the sink at most hotels and in your bathroom as well if you want it to standup</li>

    <li> not expensive. easy to use. toothbrush fits easily. brush has fresh taste. much better than leaving brush on sink unprotected</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  First is does not hold large toothbrushes.  Second the sanitizing light only shines on the brush.</li>
    <li> while this product may clean the brushes which it does and removes the odors the inside portion is too small for many brands. It is hard to place the brush, unless it is an old fashion manual one, in the space allotted for it and close the door so the sanitizer goes on. It must be closed all the way to work...would design larger opening for newer brands of toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> This works like a charm and is one of the smartest purchases I have made in awhile.  You just pop the toothbrush into the case and  within minutes it is sanitized!  My only suggestion would be to make the catch a bit easier to open and close.  Once it snaps closed it is a bit hard to re-open.  Other than that, I cannot think of anything other than to reiterate that I love this product!</li>
    <li> I received this toothbrush sanitizer and it works better than that &amp;#34;Zero Germ&amp;#34; in my opinion. I would highly advise getting rechargeable batteries and taking the batteries out after it gets done sanitizing.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews indicating somewhat poor build quality and short life and then looking at the price point, I decided to buy two so that if one failed, I&#x27;d have a fall back.  I live in Asia, so just returning a defective device doesn&#x27;t work for me.  At this price point, I decided that, if it worked, it was worth twice the price.  So far after about 8 months, I&#x27;m still on my first one.  It fits easily in my Dopp kit and is quite easy on batteries.  I assume it works (the light comes on as expected) and it can&#x27;t hurt China tap water, so overall I&#x27;m satisfied and haven&#x27;t had any of the quality issues I&#x27;ve read others have encountered.  My case gets pretty regular use and is carried on every trip so not just sitting on the counter at home.</li>
    <li> This item when used for travel is bulky (8 1/2&amp;#34; L x 2 1/8&amp;#34; W x 1 1/8&amp;#34; H).  It is very difficult to open, which is my biggest frustration.  Did like the fact that it will also sanitize other small items like eye make-up brushes.  Would like to be able to sanitize scissors and nail instruments also but items need to be less than 1&amp;#34; wide.  Sanitization is only performed in one small 1&amp;#34; area, 3/4 of an inch from the edge.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband. He has used it every day for about a year and a half and it still works perfectly.  He does not blot the brush first and I don&#x27;t know why that would be necessary.  UV light sterilizes water and surfaces.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. My toothbrush feels really clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOT TIP:&lt;br /&gt;1. After brushing your teeth, wash your toothbrush properly, ensuring that there are no toothpaste residue.&lt;br /&gt;2. Dry your toothbrush with a paper towel before putting it in the sanitizing case.&lt;br /&gt;3. Remove batteries after sanitizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, it might sound tedious but it really isn&#x27;t. This is personal hygiene. There can&#x27;t be any shortcuts.</li>
    <li> I use this as a travel case and it works really well. Previous models of different cases ate up batteries at a fast rate. The Zado seems to work as advertised and the batteries are lasting well beyond expectations.</li>
    <li> Though we can not see the if UV really does its job, the case is good for traveling for carrying tooth brush.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a toothbrush case and sanitizer for my battery operated Oral B toothbrush. I read quite a few reviews and didn&#x27;t find much about electric brushes fitting this product. I decided that it looked like it was big enough and decided to try it. It fits great. I think that just about any brush would fit in this case. The little rubber piece that holds the brush seems to be sturdy and able to accomodate different size necks.</li>
    <li> The baby works.  Of course, I don&#x27;t know if it really cleans and disinfects.  But the light comes on and it appears to work just as advertised.  It&#x27;s pretty neat.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite type of toothbrush sanitizer.  I don&#x27;t put my toothbrush in the case wet.  I always rinse my toothbrush after use, use a clean tissue to \\&quot;dry\\&quot; it and then place it in the case.  There is a convenient little light on top to indicate when the batteries need replacing.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these for myself and after using it for a few days, I showed it to my wife and she asked me to get one for her. I did and she is as happy with hers as I am with mine.</li>
    <li> What can I say?  I&#x27;m assuming it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.  Whether it sanitizes are not like it for traveling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other toothbrush sanitizers which have worn out rather quickly. So far, this one has lasted longer than the others I have tried.</li>
    <li> Great for toothbrush,,even motorized ones... It is big enough to use to sanitize your make up brush too but wouldn&#x27;t use&lt;br /&gt;The same case to do both. Comes in blue and pink and white to color code for different usage.</li>
    <li> It works well, but it&#x27;s so hard to open sometimes, as other reviewers note. Otherwise, a pretty good case, and lasts long.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite sanitizer. It&#x27;s lasted pretty long and seems to be one of the better made units.</li>
    <li> Like this especially when traveling - my toothbrush does not end up all over the place..</li>
    <li> bought it as a gift for a friend.  my friend loved it.  packaged well and rec&#x27;d quickly.  would buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these, a week or two after using this...I went to brush my teeth and there was MOLD beginning to grow on my toothbrush!!!! I&#x27;m not sure if other brands will work better as I&#x27;m afraid/too grossed out to try another.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothbrush sanitizer, I have purchased in awhile. I was using other brands, but after reading good reviews about this particular brand, I gave it a try. Super impressed!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Very disappointed when went to put my toothbrush in the led light came on but the uv light didn&#x27;t. Do not buy this garbage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the Zadro UV Toothbrush Sanitizer.  It is compact, easy to use and works well.  It is as advertised.</li>
    <li> I sent the broken on back for a refund. If they are cooperative, I will order at least 2 more. One for each bathroom. best way to tell if it works is to close the case in a dark room and make sure the blue UV light can be seen tru the case.  A great product if it works.</li>
    <li> Does this product clean my toothbrush with that fancy blue light?&lt;br /&gt;Honestly I have no idea if it does or not. My toothbrush looks and feels the same as before I started using this thing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I remember several years ago watching an episode of Myth Busters where they discovered that when you flush your toilet a mist of toilet water and other items is spread almost evenly across your entire bathroom surfaces. Nowhere is safe. This case gives me the confidence that my toothbrush is at least safe from the fecal spray of my toilet flush.</li>
    <li> It arrived fast and the light is awesome so you can tell it is shut properly, my toothbrush fits in it nicely as well</li>
    <li> This product does what it&#x27;s supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased a very expensive toothbrush simply because it had UV sanitizing in it&#x27;s storage unit. The UV failed in the second use and a replacement bulb was $50 online, so I looked high and low for something a little less costly. I found this on Amazon. The price for the entire unit was around $10, so I took a risk because I know UV kills bacteria and other critters. I have used it to sanitize a swimming pool and a hot tub in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived quickly and well-packed. It&#x27;s incredibly simple, and sometimes that&#x27;s the very best design. It looks like a travel toothbrush case, and could double as that. It will accommodate almost any manual toothbrush and easily accepted the brushing head of my electric one. this is dead-easy. Brush your teeth as usual, rinse and lightly dry the brush, then pop it into the case and snap it shut. The UV lights up for five minutes then shuts off automatically. That&#x27;s it. I stand the product in the corner behind my toothbrush charger and it&#x27;s totally unobtrusive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t praise this product enough. It&#x27;s simple, well made, and usable. If it dies, and I&#x27;m sure it will at some point, I can replace the entire thing for a pittance. I just bought a couple more for family members. Hey, any method of getting a step ahead of germs is fine with me.</li>
