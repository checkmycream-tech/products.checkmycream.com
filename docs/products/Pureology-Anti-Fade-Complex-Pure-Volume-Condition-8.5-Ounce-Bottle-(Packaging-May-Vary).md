      <li>was free!</li>
      <li>I love the way this shampoo makes my hair feel.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for years and love it.</li>
      <li>First of all, I was introduced to this product by my hair stylist, and loved it.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair and it leaves it silky smooth!  </li>
      <li>Pureology is hailed as one of the more high-end hair product lines available.</li>
      <li>I have very fine, straight hair and this conditioned nicely and did help with the volume.</li>
      <li>Pureology products in general are great at maintaining color and are 100% Vegan and biodgradable.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s so popular, despite the higher price tag.</li>
      <li>My hairdresser recommended this conditioner for my fine hair 10 years ago.</li>
      <li>If you have thinning, fine hair, then this is a product for you.  </li>
      <li>Adds volume to my fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Typically I don&#x27;t waste my time doing reviews, but I&#x27;m very happy with this shampoo and how it makes my hair feel and look...</li>
      <li>This shampoo is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>leaves your hair so clean and keeps the color from fading.  </li>
      <li>How true this story is</li>
      <li>I really wish it had a better scent, although, it&#x27;s not going to make or break it.  </li>
      <li>Leaves hair feeling full without drying out.</li>
      <li>Their other products are equally great.  </li>
      <li>Received the item quickly and I like this as it does not leave my hair feeling oily as a lot of brands tend to do on my hair.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and would recommend it highly....</li>
      <li>and I like the new formula better.</li>
      <li>Not only does this conditioner smell good, but your hair feels like complete silk after using it!!!  </li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>Changed salons, and couldn&#x27;t find it easily where I live...</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft, clean and full.  </li>
      <li>It makes styling easy and soft and shining.  </li>
      <li>and this is by far the best conditioner out there, plus the price is unbelievable!</li>
      <li>I give it only one star as I am sensative to many chemicals.</li>
      <li>At first I was hesitant because of the price</li>
      <li>been using Pureology products for more than ten years and wouldn&#x27;t change</li>
      <li>Makes my hair feel so smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
      <li>Love this conditioner, makes hair silky and smooth without weighing it down.  </li>
      <li>Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t take much, so you use less product than you would with other brands.</li>
      <li>Also, the bottle looks like you&#x27;re getting a bottle that stands on its head so that it&#x27;s easy to get the conditioner out when it&#x27;s running low, but the bottle I got does not stand on its head.</li>
      <li>Since I started using pure volume</li>
      <li>buy this, you&#x27;ll get very old conditioner!!</li>
      <li>This conditioner really takes the tangles out</li>
      <li>Very concentrated so you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
      <li>The scent is quite pleasant so much so that I look forward to shampooing and conditioning my hair every morning; and a little goes a long way, too.  </li>
      <li>With this use maybe a nickel amount of both the shampoo and conditioner, so even though you spend more, you are using less.</li>
      <li>this is odd, since most volumizing conditioners won&#x27;t leave any weight in the hair.</li>
      <li>but I thought I would get the new formula.</li>
      <li>The Pureology product line is natural, with no sulfates, and is 100% vegan.</li>
      <li>instead of the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; packaging shown in the description, this comes in Pyreology&#x27;s OLD packaging, which must be about 2 years&#x27; old by now.  </li>
      <li>this one smelled different and didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling quite as soft.. won&#x27;t buy again...</li>
      <li>A small amount leaves my hair shiny and full.</li>
      <li>It gives full volume to your hair and you only need a small dime size amount for use in your hair.</li>
      <li>I know I haven&#x27;t seen the old package in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
      <li>The Pure Volume conditioner works well enough to let you run your fingers through your hair in the shower, but rinses away enough so it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>

<li> Expensive but worth it.</li>

    <li> Awesome product used with the Pureology shampoo. Very concentrated so you don&#x27;t need to use much. I have very fine, straight hair and this conditioned nicely and did help with the volume.</li>
    <li> Even when I use only a pea size amount of this conditioner, it makes my hair limp and flat.  Not for me.  It does smell good though!</li>
    <li> I have used Pureology for years and I like the new formula better. But that is not the one I received. I know the title states packaging my vary but I thought I would get the new formula. I will continue to use Pureology but not this seller.</li>
    <li> This conditioner really takes the tangles out and you only need a tiny bit of it, so it lasts long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used pureology for well over a year now, and have had great results maintaining my hair color.  (redken shades EQ-- demipermanent color which fades and washes out!)  However, their claim to fame is \\&quot;no sulfates.\\&quot;  well, read the ingredients and you&#x27;ll find no sulfates but a lot of other crap.  check out aubrey organics if you&#x27;re looking for something \\&quot;natural\\&quot; with \\&quot;aromatherapy.\\&quot;  Their products are better than anything I&#x27;ve ever seen, and they don&#x27;t have ANY of those nasty chemicals.  read the label!</li>
    <li> This is a have-to-have accompaniment for Pureology Serious Colour Care Volume Shampoo.  It leaves my hair soft, clean and full.  The scent is quite pleasant so much so that I look forward to shampooing and conditioning my hair every morning; and a little goes a long way, too.  I bought from Amazon because they seem to have the most competitive prices and the shipping was free!</li>
    <li> Pureology is hailed as one of the more high-end hair product lines available. It has so many good aspects, it&#x27;s no surprise it&#x27;s so popular, despite the higher price tag. A bottle of Pureology shampoo or conditioner will cost about $25 each in store; however, on Amazon it&#x27;s almost a steal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s so great about it? The Pureology product line is natural, with no sulfates, and is 100% vegan. For those of you who aren&#x27;t concerned with such matters, it&#x27;s also highly-effective product. The Pure Volume conditioner works well enough to let you run your fingers through your hair in the shower, but rinses away enough so it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. It&#x27;s made for color-treated hair, but works on all hair types. It smells great - almost like aromatherapy - and works great too! Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t take much, so you use less product than you would with other brands. (A nickle-sized amount of conditioner is plenty for shoulder-length hair.) A set of shampoo and conditioner will last me close to 3 months, unlike other brands I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. Conditioner comes in a smaller bottle than the shampoo because you use less of it. Be sure to try the shampoo too! [[ASIN:B0019BPRIE Pureology Serious Colour Care Antifade Complex - Pure Volume Shampoo (Pink Bottle) 10.1 Oz]]</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It gives full volume to your hair and you only need a small dime size amount for use in your hair. My wife uses this product.</li>
    <li> The spa I go to uses this brand of shampoo and conditioner, and I found it cheaper here on Amazon.  Received the item quickly and I like this as it does not leave my hair feeling oily as a lot of brands tend to do on my hair.  An expensive shampoo, but definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Not only does this conditioner smell good, but your hair feels like complete silk after using it!!!  Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> Celiacs-it has wheat in it..</li>
    <li> I love the way this shampoo makes my hair feel.  This shampoo does not seem to strip the color out of my hair.</li>
    <li> First of all, I was introduced to this product by my hair stylist, and loved it.  Changed salons, and couldn&#x27;t find it easily where I live...so I ordered from Amazon, and voila!, there it was.  It was at my door within a very few days, surprisingly fast delivery!  If you have thinning, fine hair, then this is a product for you.  Their other products are equally great.  Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and worth the penny.  Your hair will feel and look healthier after using it. With other products I would have to use at least a half dollar or more of product with every shampoo.  With this use maybe a nickel amount of both the shampoo and conditioner, so even though you spend more, you are using less.</li>
    <li> Definitely my favorite. I use this with the hydrate shampoo since I have a lot of hair but sort of thin hair too. I have tried a bazillion shampoos, including drugstore and other high-end brands. This one takes the cake!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have not found anything else that protects and lifts my hair.  It has a fabulous scent too!</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner. Does a great job and lasts a lone time</li>
    <li> instead of the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; packaging shown in the description, this comes in Pyreology&#x27;s OLD packaging, which must be about 2 years&#x27; old by now.  I&#x27;ve been using Pureology for about 10 years now, and I know I haven&#x27;t seen the old package in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this, you&#x27;ll get very old conditioner!!</li>
    <li> Leaves hair feeling full without drying out.</li>
    <li> This  product was recommended  by my hair dresser and I have been using it for over five years,  it makes my hair shine and it just looks healthier . I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I tried this brand since I have been using the pureology  shampoo and like it. At first I was hesitant because of the price but this  will last a VERY long time.  you only need a tiny amount of this conditioner compared to other conditioners.  A small amount leaves my hair shiny and full.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is fantastic.  leaves your hair so clean and keeps the color from fading.  I have been using it now for a couple of years.  I would recommend it to all that color their hair.</li>
    <li> I know it sounds strange but I swear this product helps speed up drying time! My hair is thick and absorb&#x27;s water on a normal day i&#x27;m looking at 15+ mintues with the hair dryer. Since I started using pure volume it&#x27;s decreased that tiem. Leaves are with added volume without weighing it down, no residue and you only have to use very little product to see results. Pureology products in general are great at maintaining color and are 100% Vegan and biodgradable.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is so thick and does it&#x27;s job so well.  I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo for quite a while and love&lt;br /&gt;it so when I needed another bottle of conditioner, I chose Pureology.  I have a short haircut and only use&lt;br /&gt;about a bottle a year as you only need very little product to get the benefits of the conditioner.  The price&lt;br /&gt;isn&#x27;t prohibitive from that standpoint.</li>
    <li> I love this product and would recommend it highly....been using Pureology products for more than ten years and wouldn&#x27;t change</li>
    <li> Makes my hair so soft without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner, makes hair silky and smooth without weighing it down.  Adds volume to my fine hair.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This is salon quality conditioner.  My hair is healthier and more manageable since I&#x27;ve switched to using this brand.  Great fragrance, too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried it ALL and this is by far the best conditioner out there, plus the price is unbelievable!</li>
    <li> I used this product because I was told it was created without chemicals by the inventors  for his wife who had cancer.  How true this story is I don&#x27;t know however it irrated my scalp I give it only one star as I am sensative to many chemicals. If you are sensative I would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this conditioner for my fine hair 10 years ago. It is still my favorite. Expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> Seems a bit different than the last time I bought it... have bought off amazon before.. this one smelled different and didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling quite as soft.. won&#x27;t buy again... for this price, it should be consistent and great beyond expectations!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for years and love it. It was deliver quickly and in good condition.</li>
    <li> For the price, I definitely will not be buying this product again.  I don&#x27;t see that it&#x27;s mad a difference for my hair and when I use it, I feel like I need to use an excessive amount for it to feel like it&#x27;s moisturizing.</li>
    <li> this is odd, since most volumizing conditioners won&#x27;t leave any weight in the hair. Also, the bottle looks like you&#x27;re getting a bottle that stands on its head so that it&#x27;s easy to get the conditioner out when it&#x27;s running low, but the bottle I got does not stand on its head. It is a different shape than the one pictured.</li>
    <li> Pureology products are great for hair that is colored.  It makes styling easy and soft and shining.  It is a great product.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner it is perfect! I have fine hair and it leaves it silky smooth!  great sellers rec&#x27;d it right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MMVSP</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful but leaves my baby fine hair fly away.</li>
    <li> Typically I don&#x27;t waste my time doing reviews, but I&#x27;m very happy with this shampoo and how it makes my hair feel and look... BUT... it smells like baby powder to me.  :/  I really wish it had a better scent, although, it&#x27;s not going to make or break it.  I plan to continue using this until something better falls into my lap.</li>
    <li> Just like the Pure Volume Shampoo, the smell is so bad I can&#x27;t use it.  I will have to try to sample the Pureology products before ordering them on line.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite conditioner EVER! Makes my hair feel so smooth and soft. I can&#x27;t imagine using any other product ever again.</li>
