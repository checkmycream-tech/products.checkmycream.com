      <li>Love this rich hand cream.</li>
      <li>It absorbs easily and has no oily residue.  </li>
      <li>Hands down, this is the best hand cream ever made.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic product, my nails have chipped and peeled all my life, if I apply this twice a day, they are strong and grow...</li>
      <li>This hand cream was absolutely outstanding during the winter time, recovering my hands from the dryness in an amazing way (if you want a cheaper option for the Winter, a good one would be Burt&#x27;s bee, but it is a whole different idea of hand</li>
      <li>It has a mild scent, goes on smoothly, and does not leave a greasy residue.</li>
      <li>One of the best aspects of this top-rate product is the subtle scent.</li>
      <li>It smells so fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;They are also great for summer time, since they dry fast and don&#x27;t let your hands too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>An old go to favorite for hangnails and stronger nails</li>
      <li>(I bought it duty free for about $20) and frankly doesn&#x27;t work any better than standard hand cream.</li>
      <li>My hands soak it in quickly, and there is never a greasy after feel, (even when I apply more than I actually need).</li>
      <li>It has a light and attractive fragrance and the cream blends well into the hands without leaving any greasiness behind.  </li>
      <li>very very help moisturizing my hand.</li>
      <li>I first started using this product when I received a sample from a friend.</li>
      <li>Using this cream my skin is soft, smooth, and hydrated, and the scent is uplifting.</li>
      <li>it arrived late but its a great cream</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty, but still soft and clean.</li>
      <li>Not only does this Clarins hand cream keep my hands soft and cuticles supple, but the scent alone is amazing.</li>
      <li>At my next appointment, my tech praised me for taking such good care of my cuticles...</li>
      <li>/&gt;Lastly, a tip: put the cream on the top of your hands and spread with the other top part of your hands to then finally use the palms so they don&#x27;t get to greasy.</li>
      <li>My hands are super soft.</li>
      <li>It is very moisturizing but not  greasy.  </li>
      <li>Very healing.</li>
      <li>My husband and I love it, and steal it from each other.</li>
      <li>Since it comes from Paris, it is more spendy than  my usual hand and nail treatments, but it is worth every cent.</li>
      <li>My second favorite hand cream (only because of the cost) as it is very moisturizing without being greasy.</li>
      <li>fast absorbing, complete comfort hand cream</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>It makes your hands look like new again.</li>
      <li>I am a 28 years old Brazilian that lives in NY and had to get used to the dryness of the winter heating.</li>
      <li>Anytime people shake my hand they always comment on how soft my hands are.</li>
      <li>I like this hand cream, but the price and that it is not for super dry hands, which I have, makes me go back to Neutrogena</li>
      <li>And I personally think the scent is very old ladyish!</li>
      <li>In just a few days, my cuticles softened right up, and it even lightens the brown spots on the back of my hands (a bonus)!  </li>

    <li> Have only been using it a few weeks. So far not much change on my hands</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good moisturizer for my hands with a pleasant smell and this one fits the bill!</li>
    <li> very very help moisturizing my hand. I best hand cream I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This cream is marvelous. I have used it for years and buy it as gifts. Literally, do not leave home without it! I use it everyday!</li>
    <li> I am amazed at how immediate the results are after using this hand cream. As an artist, my hands get so dried out from constant washing. Using this cream my skin is soft, smooth, and hydrated, and the scent is uplifting. I give this my highest recommendation.</li>
    <li> This cream is so great.  It smells so fresh and clean.  It is especially nice that it is not greasy.  I wish I had gotten the smaller size so I could put it in my purse.</li>
    <li> Excellent hand cream. This is my second tube and I will keep buying; I have not found a better product.</li>
    <li> My hands are super soft.</li>
    <li> AMAZING!! Smells awesome too. Highly recommend it. When I use this product, I&#x27;ve noticed my hands are less dry even after washing.</li>
    <li> Excellent Hand Cream!  It does everything that it claims to do!  It is very moisturizing but not  greasy.  Has a nice clean scent too : )</li>
    <li> Love this rich hand cream. It smells great, it&#x27;s non greasy, no sticky and absorbs well. It has helped my nails, cuticles and the brown spots on my hands are fading.</li>
    <li> Does not moisturize hands.</li>
    <li> Hands down, this is the best hand cream ever made.  It absorbs easily and has no oily residue.  One of the best aspects of this top-rate product is the subtle scent.</li>
    <li> Clarins make excellent products and their Hand and Nail Treatment Cream is one of the best.  It has a light and attractive fragrance and the cream blends well into the hands without leaving any greasiness behind.  Perfect for the office drawer or home.  Amazon&#x27;s price is a bargain too so stock up or give as gifts for the Holidays.</li>
    <li> I like this hand cream, but the price and that it is not for super dry hands, which I have, makes me go back to Neutrogena fast absorbing, complete comfort hand cream</li>
    <li> An old go to favorite for hangnails and stronger nails</li>
    <li> I first started using this product when I received a sample from a friend. I had a problem with splitting nails and some dark spots on the back of my hands. The Clarins cream made a difference in my nails. They started to grow and the splitting was definitely improved. There may be a slight difference in the appearance of dark spots on my hands, hard to tell because my hands are tanned now. In any case, I was pleased with the product so I ordered the larger size. It has a mild scent, goes on smoothly, and does not leave a greasy residue.</li>
    <li> It makes your hands look like new again. I am a 28 years old Brazilian that lives in NY and had to get used to the dryness of the winter heating. This hand cream was absolutely outstanding during the winter time, recovering my hands from the dryness in an amazing way (if you want a cheaper option for the Winter, a good one would be Burt&#x27;s bee, but it is a whole different idea of hand treatment).&lt;br /&gt;They are also great for summer time, since they dry fast and don&#x27;t let your hands too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell. For me it smells like &amp;#34;old-time&amp;#34; cosmetics - this is something I love.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, a tip: put the cream on the top of your hands and spread with the other top part of your hands to then finally use the palms so they don&#x27;t get to greasy.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, my nails have chipped and peeled all my life, if I apply this twice a day, they are strong and grow...also great for my hands and age spots.</li>
    <li> After two days of using this I have already seen amazing results. My hard, painful hangnails are softened and my cuticles look great. Would 100000% recommend</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hand cream. Anytime people shake my hand they always comment on how soft my hands are. This also makes my nails look shinier and stronger. I keep buying it because nothing else makes my hands look this nice.</li>
    <li> My cuticles were so dry and hard that my nail technician suggested I try this Clarins product. Since it comes from Paris, it is more spendy than  my usual hand and nail treatments, but it is worth every cent. In just a few days, my cuticles softened right up, and it even lightens the brown spots on the back of my hands (a bonus)!  At my next appointment, my tech praised me for taking such good care of my cuticles...and I owed it all to her and Clarins. A wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Best hand cream ever. My husband and I love it, and steal it from each other. Unfortunately, because of the price, I had to look for a substitute and have not found one that works so well.</li>
    <li> Meh. I don&#x27;t know why people rave about this hand lotion. It&#x27;s expensive (I bought it duty free for about $20) and frankly doesn&#x27;t work any better than standard hand cream. And I personally think the scent is very old ladyish!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen an incredible difference in my hands but it smells wonderful</li>
    <li> I always try to buy this hand lotion. It is an wonderful product. It is nice to spoil myself and than I buy this hand creme</li>

    <li> These were a present for my daughter who realy likes Clarins products.These are excellent quality creams and will be reordered.</li>
    <li> My second favorite hand cream (only because of the cost) as it is very moisturizing without being greasy. Very nice scent. Wish it were a little less expensive.</li>
    <li> Good, but you can find better</li>
    <li> Not only does this Clarins hand cream keep my hands soft and cuticles supple, but the scent alone is amazing. It&#x27;s pretty, but still soft and clean. My hands soak it in quickly, and there is never a greasy after feel, (even when I apply more than I actually need).
