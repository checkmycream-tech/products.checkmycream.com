<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been using this product over 5 years now and nothing compares to the lightweight feel and fresh kiwi pear scent this product has. I am 38 years old and people constantly think I am in my late 20&#x27;s early 30&#x27;s and I DO contribute that to this product. I originally started using this product years ago after someone told me it was a good after sun/tanning salon moisterizer. I liked the results so much that I started to use it as a daily facial moisterizer because it wasn&#x27;t heavy on the skin and not greasy and since I have sensitive skin, it was just right. It has a firming agent that leaves your skin feeling firm and refreshed. Great to use before you apply concealer/foundation.</li>
    <li> I tried using a &#x27;sun&#x27; moisturizer  prior to going to a tanning salon in preparation for a sun-filled vacation to get a base tan. One day I was stuck w/o my usual department store facial moisturizer and used my &#x27;tanning&#x27; moisturizer in a pinch - WOW!! That&#x27;s all I use now on my face which is oily and sensitive. ANGEL moisturizer is the best I have found so far-and I&#x27;ve tried at least a half dozen. It has a nice delicate scent, leaves no shine, glides on easily, absorbs quickly, and can be used around the eye area w/ no creeping into the corners of the eyes causing stinging/tearing. Nice size bottle w/ a good pump!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for your face ...... Or body!</li>
    <li> I tried this lotion about three years ago and wanted more,I went to Amazon and there it was my husband ordered for me,they changed the formula or something it does not glide on like before. The smell is alot stronger. I like the older formula. But this will do.</li>
    <li> Smells great, you get a ton of it, lasts quite a while and is just great! I have sensitive skin also and it doesn&#x27;t cause any reactions.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine turned me on to Angel lotion a few years ago and I feel in love with it.</li>
    <li> Five stars for this post-tanning lotion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, let me say that I started with the Designer Skin “Juicy” lotion sold on Amazon. Don’t get me wrong – Juicy is a great lotion but the consistency is a bit thinner and the peach scent is a bit more potent for my preference.  I decided to venture off and try “Angel” and I don’t think I’ll ever go back to another lotion – and that includes ANY type of lotion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is super silky and soft after using this lotion and it truly does brighten the glow on my skin! There’s no oily residue, the consistency is just perfect so that’s it not too runny or thick, and the smell is light and great! I use it after I shower every night and I can truly tell that this lotion has really enhanced my skin overall. The tan on my legs look more bronzed and glowy the next day and my skin feels nourished and hydrated. $15 for this bad boy is such an amazing deal for what it does for your skin. I highly recommend it and I’m considering using this lotion year round even when I’m not tanning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is that it’s not offered in a bigger bottle!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend and I love this lotion! It is think enough to last for a good while but its not too thick or sticky. I put it on everyday and nothing makes my skin as soft.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion. It&#x27;s great for after tanning or any other time even. Smells wonderful and really sticks with you without leaving you sticky feeling.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion to use after I self tan with the Sheer Tan product and it works well.  It has a very silky feel and works great for my arms and legs.  The scent is kiwi pear.  It&#x27;s light, not overpowering but definitely does have a scent.  The bottle is huge. Overall, very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this lotion after buying it from my tanning salon. They stopped selling it there and I was very happy when I found it online.  This is exactly the same lotion at a VERY good price.  I spent nearly three times this amount on the store bought bottle.  Smells great!</li>
    <li> This product was a gift for my mom.  She loves it!  She claims the lotion smells wonderful and feels so nice on her skin! :)</li>
    <li> This lotion I like much better than the Hempz aftersun lotion. It smells much better and works just as well. It has a creamy texture and absorbs quickly. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have always found this product in a tanning salon which I never tan but loved the product.  They no longer carry it and i found it here! Yay!!  Arrived on time and product is great!</li>
    <li> I work in a tanning salon that doesn&#x27;t sell Designer Skin.  Based on my past experience with this after tan lotion I wanted to get it again, despite having an employee discount on lotions in my store.  I love the way this one feel and the smell is amazing!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer. I tried so many different moisturizers before this one,and none delivered the results that I obtained from this product. It coats your skin, and makes it feel incredibly soft and silky. It also smells great.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer!! I am really picky about the consistency of a lotion or moisturizer and I have found that this one is perfect. I use it everyday as a full body lotion (nothing pertaining to tanning, which I believe is what it was intended for). The tropical kiwi smell is amazing and it leaves the skin feeling so smooth and soft, soaking in quickly with no greasy residue. I highly recommend it, I always have an additional one on hand! :)</li>
    <li> originally bought this because I bought it at the tanning salon several times so I thought how could I go wrong its the same product right not necessarily true when I received it yes the bottle looks the same but the product inside was totally different,and had a weird smell and was very watery and greasy</li>
    <li> Skin feels velvet y great moisture none scented. Would buy again and recommend to other people who love a velvet feeling</li>
    <li> I seriously can&#x27;t think of a better lotion anywhere. Leaves your skin all silky and it smells divine.  My husband gets cracked heels, I notice he keeps,dipping into my lotion because it works,so well</li>
    <li> Good for moisturization, but leaves the skin a bit oily..this lotion is SUPER thick and doesn&#x27;t not spread well. It kind of just sticks in one area. Feels good on the skin after tanning; so I guess it works okay..</li>
    <li> Great product and arrived before date promised. Product had need squeezed out in to package some.</li>
    <li> I am so dependent on this lotion. It has been my absolute favorite for almost 10 years now. I don&#x27;t know what I will do if they ever stop making it!!</li>
    <li> You will not be disappointed I promise.  For less than it sells in any tanning salon, you can get it right here on Amazon!  It smells amazing, dries fast and the texture is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Great Product! Shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> very moisturizing. I really love the silky feel of it. However, the smell is not all that great.....it smells like cheap pineapple oil. The smell is tolerable, but they could have done better with it in that department.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lotion.  It lasts a long time too!  I bought my first bottle at a tanning salon and was so excited when I saw it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> good lotion and smells great</li>
    <li> This product was a holiday gift from a friend.  When I ran out of it, I wanted more.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. reasonably priced and alot of it. smells fantastic! will buy again when I run out. doesnt make my skin feel like I rubbed oil all over me after using it.</li>
    <li> As always, this product is magnificent!! I have used this lotion for over 3 years and choose this every time!</li>
    <li> 5 stars for smells good dries quickly without leaving sticky or limey skin. Recon. To all great product and helps with wrinkles</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this moisturizer. It Kiwi Pear frangrance. It really makes your skin feel soft also, without any greasy feel like some others.</li>
    <li> It smells like peach, so it is not too sweet....it leaves skin feeling soft, nourished, without sticky feeling, and it made me glow at night after a morning application...love it!</li>
    <li> This lotion is great!!! Goes on smooth, no clumping, no stickiness and smells divine!!!!! Well worth the money it costs!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It has a nice smell, but its not overwhelming.  Some lotions are grease but this one isn&#x27;t.  Its silky and I love how it makes my skin feels.</li>
    <li> love this lotion, smells great best of designer skins.. tried some of the newer ones but I keep coming back to this one</li>
    <li> Smells great, feels great and cheaper than purchasing it in a salon...my favorite lotion ever! Will never use anything else</li>
    <li> Very silky and smooth when you put it on. Not oily. Lasts all day! Huge bottle for a great price. I used it tanning and it was perfect and worked well. Smells great. Shipped fast.</li>
    <li> This is a thick creamy lotion that smells AMAZING. But, I haven&#x27;t seen any skin firming which is what the product advertises.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It smells great and its a lot smoother than regular lotions. I definitely recommend this product even if you don&#x27;t tan indoors/outdoors.</li>
    <li> Overall this is a great product.. i will be buying it again.. smells light and not oily on skin plus i THINK the tone of my skin feels firmer then before using this product.. its only been about 3 weeks but its great and i love it. the only con is that it doesnt feel like it lasts all day..</li>
    <li> I hate a heavy oily lotion I can&#x27;t stand the feel. This lotion leaves a light silky feel and a fresh clean scent. There is NOT an \\&quot;after tanning\\&quot; scent at all!! This lotion is everything I&#x27;ve dreamed of NOT TO BE USED JUST FOR AFTER TANNING!!! I&#x27;ve gotten my 70 yr. old mother hooked, her skin looks 29yrs younger!!! One use and you&#x27;ll be hooked....ENJOY</li>
    <li> Lotions are usually thick and cause me to sweat. I have been using this for 2 weeks now and this is perfect.  Soaks in my skin leaving it soft and a light scent! I will buy this again!</li>
