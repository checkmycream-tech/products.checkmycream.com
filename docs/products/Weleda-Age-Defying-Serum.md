      <li>Best price here, thanks</li>
      <li>It is an excellent product for my sensitive skin, and it is effective in helping to reduce the signs of aging.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, and Weleda pomegranate products have been perfect.</li>
      <li>I purchased this as a moisturizer for oily skin because I use light oils or gel moisturizers and serums are good moisturizers for oily skin people.</li>
      <li>It is perfect for people with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>&amp; I get more break-outs now than I did as a hormonal teenager.</li>
      <li>Love the fragrance.</li>
      <li>The product is satisfactory, but I recommend the night cream for better absorption and results.</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>but I had hoped for better results.  </li>
      <li>I love this serum from Weleda, that is my favorite brand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This does have aloe vera which is known to sooth the skin and has organic pomegranate juice which tightens pores, and has a nice light scent.</li>
      <li>love this Pomegranate line, great for us mature gals.  </li>
      <li>Overall this product is good for tightening and freshening up your skin!</li>
      <li>I cannot honestly give you much of an opinion on this one.</li>
      <li>I honestly love the fresh smell of pomegranate in this serum.</li>
      <li>Not greasy at all, soaks into skin, has a light fruity scent.  </li>
      <li>it is worth the money!</li>
      <li>It smells like a light fresh tangy fruit.</li>
      <li>most natural ingredients, clean &amp; fabulous aroma, NOT perfumy....</li>
      <li>I love the WELEDA pomegranate serie - it makes my skin firm and look good.</li>
      <li>It soaks into my skin fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just one, quick pump and patted on the skin</li>
      <li>It is the first thing I want to put on my face, My eyes says thank you every time!</li>
      <li>The only problem is that this product is very sticky, which I guess is a good thing, so I know its oil-free, even tho</li>
      <li>It kind of reminds me of Eminence or Ilike products that only contain fruit juices and no preservatives because of the stickiness.</li>
      <li>Just like other Weleda product, this firming serum has good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>-er right after applying the product.&lt;br /&gt;The downside of the product is the price.</li>
      <li>First of all, I like to use this to fresh my face in the morning and during the day.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic product and very well priced for what it is.&lt;br /&gt;Applied (patted on lightly) before the night cream, this serum gently tightens and firms.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a beautifully smooth, easily absorbed fluid that melds very well with the follow on products.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>This works pretty well for firming</li>
      <li>I used to buy Dr Hauschka products and last year I switched over to the Weleda pomegranate line and can see and feel the difference; plus this line of skin care is much more affordable.</li>
      <li>Making an adjustment certainly helps, serum is quickly absorbed but for the price, not as effective as the other products in this Weleda line.</li>
      <li>I have been using the Weleda facial line for about 1 year, rotating between the Wild Rose and Pomegranate...</li>
      <li>It is natural and most moisturizers use chemicals for preserving the product, but I like the natural of it and that the scent is not a perfumey one that had to be put in.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really need it</li>
      <li>I really like this serum it helps tighten up your skin if used per the instructions.  </li>
      <li>The scent overall is not harsh, but yet a light fruity scent.</li>
      <li>Its a really decent product.</li>
      <li>I wake up with a new zit.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, this product helps reduce sensitivity.</li>
      <li>I was really surprised to even find a product like this on Amazon with the ingredients list.</li>
      <li>Skin feels soft and glows.</li>
      <li>Makes your skin so soft.</li>
      <li>Just have to be careful on how much you use.</li>
      <li>While I do really like the other products in this line-</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using the Weleda facial line for about 1 year, rotating between the Wild Rose and Pomegranate...love this Pomegranate line, great for us mature gals.  Best price here, thanks</li>
    <li> I honestly love the fresh smell of pomegranate in this serum. First of all, I like to use this to fresh my face in the morning and during the day. I cleanse my face and then apply this. I have oily skin, so I do have excessive oils sometimes and I get breakouts and blackheads on my nose. However, after a few squirts of this thing on my face, it helps calms my red pimples. It also helps my face not be so oily. I like the consistency of this product with it being not too heavy or oily. It soaks into my skin fairly quickly. The scent overall is not harsh, but yet a light fruity scent. It is perfect for people with sensitive skin. This is a great alternative for a moisturizer. It is natural and most moisturizers use chemicals for preserving the product, but I like the natural of it and that the scent is not a perfumey one that had to be put in. This does have aloe vera which is known to sooth the skin and has organic pomegranate juice which tightens pores, and has a nice light scent. Overall this product is good for tightening and freshening up your skin!</li>
    <li> I used to buy Dr Hauschka products and last year I switched over to the Weleda pomegranate line and can see and feel the difference; plus this line of skin care is much more affordable. Love the fragrance.</li>
    <li> The product is satisfactory, but I recommend the night cream for better absorption and results. Use day and night. The design angle of the serum pump causes the serum direction to shoot above and over your hand or intended application spot, causing expensive loss of product. Making an adjustment certainly helps, serum is quickly absorbed but for the price, not as effective as the other products in this Weleda line.</li>
    <li> I love this serum from Weleda, that is my favorite brand.&lt;br /&gt;I trust Weleda, I don&#x27;t have to check every single ingredient on the list. I know, the company, that was founded in 1921 still have the same mission as it was when Rudolf Steiner started the company.</li>
    <li> I like and enjoy this product, very happy with it and am glad I bought it!  It is the first thing I want to put on my face, My eyes says thank you every time!</li>
    <li> Great scent and a wonderful feeling on the face when applying! I have sensitive skin, and Weleda pomegranate products have been perfect.</li>
    <li> Also allergic to this</li>
    <li> This works pretty well for firming but I had hoped for better results.  I think the cost is a little high considering the size.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum it helps tighten up your skin if used per the instructions.  Just have to be careful on how much you use.</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product for my sensitive skin, and it is effective in helping to reduce the signs of aging.</li>
    <li> Tightens and moisturizers. Skin feels soft and glows.</li>
    <li> While I do really like the other products in this line- I cannot honestly give you much of an opinion on this one. I am 53 &amp; I get more break-outs now than I did as a hormonal teenager. (What is up with that anyway? ?!!!!) The few times I have used this- I wake up with a new zit. I doubt seriously it is the fault of the product. Seriously figure it IS my skin&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> I love the WELEDA pomegranate serie - it makes my skin firm and look good. I tried a couple other anti-aging cremes and lotions because the products are not cheap, but I always come back - it is worth the money! I think the secret of the pomegranate serie and its effect on the skin is the serum!&lt;br /&gt; One bottle lasts about 6-7 weeks used twice a day - and I don&#x27;t use it sparingly!</li>
    <li> Just like other Weleda product, this firming serum has good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I can feel my face is getting firm-er right after applying the product.&lt;br /&gt;The downside of the product is the price. The price is a little high to me.</li>
    <li> most natural ingredients, clean &amp; fabulous aroma, NOT perfumy.... I could actually feel my face tighten up when applied...wikipedia WELEDA to find out more about this great company!</li>
    <li> goes on easily, smells wonderful, feels great!  For anyone looking for &#x27;something&#x27; when nothing doesn&#x27;t do during the day, or under the day cream, or night cream..</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, this product helps reduce sensitivity. Makes your skin so soft. Will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product and very well priced for what it is.&lt;br /&gt;Applied (patted on lightly) before the night cream, this serum gently tightens and firms.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a beautifully smooth, easily absorbed fluid that melds very well with the follow on products.&lt;br /&gt;And it lasts for ages. You don&#x27;t slather it on. It&#x27;s just one, quick pump and patted on the skin and that&#x27;s it. For that reason you don&#x27;t need anything bigger.&lt;br /&gt;Considering it&#x27;s biodynamic, cruelty free and made with the best ingredients backed by years of science and reputation, this is my fave go to product and I would not use anything else.</li>
    <li> I like the company and appreciate their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does it work?  I guess it&#x27;s okay, it&#x27;s a part of my daily regimen and I&#x27;d like to think it&#x27;s helping but when the wrinkles are as well entrenched as mine, I&#x27;d need some serious spackle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do like is how it feels on my face in addition to their other day creams that I also use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These sorts of products are so subjective but yes, I&#x27;d recommend them.</li>
    <li> The two moisturizers I&#x27;m currently using are Huile27 by Michelle Everard Skinlab and Herve Herau. I purchased this as a moisturizer for oily skin because I use light oils or gel moisturizers and serums are good moisturizers for oily skin people. I don&#x27;t really need it but, whatever, I got it so... I usually don&#x27;t buy products like this on Amazon because I categorize them as \\&quot;drugstore brands\\&quot; and they usually contain crap. Even the \\&quot;organic\\&quot; drugstore brands contain mineral oil, dimethicone and parabens. I was really surprised to even find a product like this on Amazon with the ingredients list. The smell is great also. It smells like a light fresh tangy fruit. I want to say grapefruit or something. The only problem is that this product is very sticky, which I guess is a good thing, so I know its oil-free, even tho it contains oils, but it has fruit juice in it. It kind of reminds me of Eminence or Ilike products that only contain fruit juices and no preservatives because of the stickiness. I put a drop of almond oil on after because of the stickiness. Its a really decent product.</li>
    <li> Not greasy at all, soaks into skin, has a light fruity scent.  I&#x27;m only 25, but when I wake up in the morning my skin looks brighter and tighter than before.</li>
