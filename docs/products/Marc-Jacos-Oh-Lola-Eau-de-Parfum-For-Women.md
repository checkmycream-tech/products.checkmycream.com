      <li>Love Marc Jacobs line</li>
      <li>Still satisfied.</li>
      <li>Thank you:]</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Lola is one of my top five perfumes so I decided to give this a try.</li>
      <li>Vanilla isn&#x27;t a favorite of mine but since hubby bought the biggest size it&#x27;s growing on me.</li>
      <li>, I would say it is feminine without the overwhelming and headache-producing smell of many others (e.g. j&#x27;adore).</li>
      <li>This is my favorite scent, so I am bias.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really In love with this</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Favorite scent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed this with most Marc Jacobs perfumes.</li>
      <li>I love all Marc Jacobs fragrances.</li>
      <li>My favorite perfume ever.</li>
      <li>Whereas the original Lola perfume is very strong and almost musky, this version is very light, feminine, and even a bit sweet.</li>
      <li>I love to spray it on a warm day when I just want to feel fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>Not only is it absolutely gorgeous with it&#x27;s flower-shaped lid, it smells even better!</li>
      <li>sexy and clean with a scent that will capture everyone&#x27;s attention.</li>
      <li>Such a beautiful, girly scent.</li>
      <li>If this is any indicator of how wonderful this perfume is, I think that is a good thing, sort of,  because we have been married for 40 years and are really really use to each other.  </li>
      <li>Love the fresh floral scent will purchase again</li>
      <li>such a great fragrance you can wear at night to bed (to cuddle with the hubby) or to work as a splash of fragrance....</li>
      <li>light and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>I do not like strong sweet fragrances and this one is not like that</li>
      <li>Very clean and fresh</li>
      <li>I bought this after so many good reviews, I find it to be less attractive than Daisy, the fragrance isn&#x27;t very strong and not very floral.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth the time!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but definitely worth it!</li>
      <li>Oh Lola is too stickey sweet for my taste.  </li>
      <li>Quick shipping, daughter loves it, cheapest price around.</li>
      <li>A great buy for a woman of any age: young or old.</li>
      <li>It smells wonderful and long lasting scent I can smell on myself from morning to night!</li>
      <li>Very feminine and light.</li>
      <li>By far my favorite perfume I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
      <li>Lola is more subtle and has more musky smell - love that one.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would like it, as I don&#x27;t really care for the smell of it&#x27;s older \\&quot;sister\\&quot;, Lola, but I think I&#x27;ve fallen in love.</li>
      <li>Everything arrived right on time.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smells very strong at first spray but then three minutes later the fragrance disappears.</li>
      <li>and I received my perfume super fast</li>
      <li>It makes me feel so pretty when I wear it....</li>
      <li>Its exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>When it was more than 2 weeks after estimated arrival date, I contacted the vendor, and the only explanation I received was that it must have gotten lost.  </li>
      <li>Arrived promptly &amp; exactly as advertised</li>
      <li>The plastic floral cap is cute, but it is sort of large and cumbersome (larger than it looks in the picture)</li>
      <li>Love this scent - very flowery, but a little lighter than the original Lola.  </li>
      <li>scent is definitely fruity, but more of light, refreshingly clean fruit scent.. not sickly sweet or syrupy at all.  </li>
      <li>but when I got it as a Christmas gift I didn&#x27;t remember it having such a strong vanilla scent.  </li>
      <li>My go to gift for my wife and much cheaper here then in the stores.</li>

    <li> Got this for my sister for a christmas present. Its exactly what I wanted. And what she wanted! Thank you:]</li>
    <li> Yet another great scent by Marc Jacobs. After smelling this at Dillard&#x27;s the other day, I just had to buy it. Not only is it absolutely gorgeous with it&#x27;s flower-shaped lid, it smells even better! I didn&#x27;t think I would like it, as I don&#x27;t really care for the smell of it&#x27;s older \\&quot;sister\\&quot;, Lola, but I think I&#x27;ve fallen in love. Whereas the original Lola perfume is very strong and almost musky, this version is very light, feminine, and even a bit sweet. A great buy for a woman of any age: young or old.</li>
    <li> This fragrance smells wonderful, but even though I thoroughly spray my neck, hair, and clothes the scent is GONE by noon.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Favorite scent. I hope it never gets discontinued !</li>
    <li> Very well received Christmas present!</li>
    <li> Ordered as a gift for my sister, for she wanted this one. She loves it.</li>
    <li> I love love love this fragrance!  It makes me feel so pretty when I wear it....such a great fragrance you can wear at night to bed (to cuddle with the hubby) or to work as a splash of fragrance....I&#x27;d even go so far as saying you could wear it out with you girls at a bar or something...a very universal scent!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just smells amazing. Like flowers and sunshine.</li>
    <li> It was a Christmas gift for my Granddaughter.  She loved it!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this perfume BRAND NEW and Sealed in the plastic. It smells very pretty perfect for the spring and summer. But it does not last. It&#x27;s smells very strong at first spray but then three minutes later the fragrance disappears. I spent a lot of money on this and it&#x27;s very disappointing that it doesn&#x27;t last. Now I just have a fragrance that stays on my dresser for decoration.</li>
    <li> You know how it is, you get a fragrance in your mind from the past that you remember was soothing and made you feel happy, safe,warm and delicious inside but you can&#x27;t put your finger on what it was? This is what &amp;#34;Oh Lola by Marc Jacobs&amp;#34; is for me! It is soft, soothing and my husband wants to stick his nose to my neck all day. If this is any indicator of how wonderful this perfume is, I think that is a good thing, sort of,  because we have been married for 40 years and are really really use to each other.  It can get annoying though since he can&#x27;t seem to keep his hands off of me. If you don&#x27;t mind having your husband or sweetheart plastered to you, a lot, this is a wonderful, flirty, effervescent yet warm, floral fragrance that gets better as it blends with your own body chemistry.</li>
    <li> I bought this without ever having smelled it before because I&#x27;m a huge fan of Marc Jacobs perfumes and this one sounded great. No surprise, LOVE the scent! Like others have mentioned, you do need a few sprays of it to get the full scent and you will probably have to reapply a time or two during the day, but it&#x27;s worth the time! The plastic floral cap is cute, but it is sort of large and cumbersome (larger than it looks in the picture) but I can&#x27;t see that being a reason not to buy. Love it!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it. Good buy for the money. Great value for the bottle size.</li>
    <li> Beautiful scent and cheaper than in department stores.  I would order this again.</li>
    <li> Love this scent - very flowery, but a little lighter than the original Lola.  This size was a little large for the time period I needed it, so I might recommend the smaller bottle.  Very attractive flower top!</li>
    <li> This is a great smelling perfume! I can smell it throughout the day, which shows it&#x27;s staying power. You will not be disappointed and the cost bests the department stores, by far!</li>
    <li> Be careful!!!  Thought I was buying Lola did not know there was an Oh Lola.  Oh Lola is too stickey sweet for my taste.  Could get very annoying for those around you.  Lola is more subtle and has more musky smell - love that one.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about purchasing this for such a low price as it retails for $88 at Sephora but this is definitely the real deal. It smells amazing! Such a beautiful, girly scent. Even my husband loved it and he hates the smell of most perfumes. The only downside about it is that the scent doesn&#x27;t last very lomg, maybe 2-3 hours max. I&#x27;ve noticed this with most Marc Jacobs perfumes. If I layer it with unscented body lotion though, it tends to last longer.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product, and I was waiting for it. When it was more than 2 weeks after estimated arrival date, I contacted the vendor, and the only explanation I received was that it must have gotten lost.  I received a refund, but I didn&#x27;t appreciate that the item was lost for so long and vendor never did anything to track down from his end or track if items are actually received. Will not buy perfumes on amazon again.</li>
    <li> good product. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> My go to gift for my wife and much cheaper here then in the stores.</li>
    <li> I bought as a gift for my daughters birthday.  She had smelled it before loved it and so did her husband.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this fragrance a little over a year ago and it instantly moved to my &amp;#34;Favorite-of-all-time&amp;#34; list!</li>
    <li> Love the scent, just doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite fragrances!  LOVE this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really In love with this oh lola. which smells beautiful love the scent. I am going to order one for my mom for mothers day.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift and it worked out very well. She was happy and so was I</li>
    <li> Lola! by Marc Jacobs is a great perfume for day or night. I also think it is a wonderful value at this price.</li>
    <li> Help! I&#x27;ve been kidnapped by a jolly fat man and several deranged widgets covered in bells! Rabid reindeer tear through the snow at break-neck speeds. I fear for my life. On the plus side my girlfriend loves this Marc Jacobs perfume I purchased for her...</li>
    <li> Smells so good, great scent for the summer! Very feminine and light.</li>
    <li> By far my favorite perfume I&#x27;ve purchased. It&#x27;s slightly floral, slightly sweet, and a little musky. I always receive compliments. For a while I was disappointed as I feel the fragrance didn&#x27;t last as long as I would like, but apparently it&#x27;s still subtly there! Love it.</li>
    <li> This will be the way I buy perfume for my wife from now on.. I saved money.. She was happy with the product. Thank you</li>
    <li> good price and smell great.</li>
    <li> I tried it on in the store .  I like it then but when I got it as a Christmas gift I didn&#x27;t remember it having such a strong vanilla scent.  Vanilla isn&#x27;t a favorite of mine but since hubby bought the biggest size it&#x27;s growing on me.</li>
    <li> Lola is one of my top five perfumes so I decided to give this a try. I don&#x27;t like it very much, it smells cheap like a perfume from Victorias secret.</li>
    <li> Did not smell like it. I think it was a knock off.</li>
    <li> light and lasts all day. Love Marc Jacobs line but this one if my fave.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and ordered it after I fell in love with Daisy, the Perfume smells great and was shipped quickly and Packaged well! I would reorder this perfume again!</li>
    <li> I bought this fragrance for my sister as a present, she did not know about it but she loved it as soon as she tried it. Giving a perfume as a gift requires knowing the person very well therefore I cannot guarantee everyone will like it. I do not like strong sweet fragrances and this one is not like that, I would say it is feminine without the overwhelming and headache-producing smell of many others (e.g. j&#x27;adore).</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my daughter&#x27;s birthday. I searched everywhere for the best price and I found it on Amazon. The perfume was just as exspected. The bottle is beautiful and displays nicely on her dressing table. The fragrance is great too. I find myself using a little too. Great fragrance at great price.</li>
    <li> Great price for a 3.4 oz bottle of Marc Jacobs Oh Lola! perfume! It smells wonderful and long lasting scent I can smell on myself from morning to night! I had to buy it for the mere $60 dollars! Sephora and Ulta wanted close to $80 and above!</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly &amp; exactly as advertised</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, very feminine, smells great and comes in a beautiful bottle.</li>
    <li> I love,love,love this fragrance. I wil not wear anything else. It&#x27;s soft, not too fruity. sexy and clean with a scent that will capture everyone&#x27;s attention. My husband absolutely adores how I smell when I wear this. I can&#x27;t go anywhere without people asking me what I&#x27;m wearing. Oh Lola, by Marc Jacobs is truly  a hit. Long lasting scent and  you won&#x27;t need a lot. Purchase the lotion too for added pleasure.</li>
    <li> Smells beautiful and I received my perfume super fast I&#x27;m very happy with the delivery service as well as product</li>
    <li> Everything arrived right on time.  The perfume bottle was beautiful and I gave this fragrance to a friend for Christmas.  I had a hard time finding it at any department store.  My friend loved it.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, daughter loves it, cheapest price around.</li>
    <li> So juicy, refreshing, and playful- perfect for spring and summer. I love to spray it on a warm day when I just want to feel fresh and clean. However, I do think it&#x27;s a scent for those in their 20s or under.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is definitely fruity, but more of light, refreshingly clean fruit scent.. not sickly sweet or syrupy at all.  Floral notes are slightly muted at first, and I smell more raspberry and strawberry.  Upon dry down I get more of a floral, vanilla, sandalwoody scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also nothing like Marc Jacobs&#x27; purple Lola perfume at all.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume ever. I love all Marc Jacobs fragrances.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter for Christmas - she requested - best deal I found out there - Happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Item was perfect. It was packaged well. Shipping was extremely fast. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this after so many good reviews, I find it to be less attractive than Daisy, the fragrance isn&#x27;t very strong and not very floral. Won&#x27;t order it again</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my mom. Even though it was the wrong one, she kept it and loves the flower on it. I think Marc Jacobs has different ones and there is one that has Lola with a different flower on the bottle cap. Still satisfied.</li>
    <li> I love it. Very clean and fresh</li>
    <li> A perfect transaction with no hitches.  Product is perfect too!</li>
    <li> Love the fresh floral scent will purchase again Product arrived in secured box and no damages arived before date expected.</li>
    <li> I bought it because I really liked the sample size I got as a gift.  I got a lot of compliments for it.  I was very ecstatic to see it on Amazon. The bottle is the cutest thing I have ever seen.  Unfortunately, the smell does not stay at all, especially compared to the sample I got, which is very weird and disappointing.</li>
    <li> Great! Smells so good</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this scent!</li>
    <li> I searched all over for a good perfume that&#x27;s not too over powering, yet somewhat flowery. I went to Sephora and took their &amp;#34;what scent fits you?&amp;#34; quiz and this was one of the suggestions. It&#x27;s pricey, but definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent, so I am bias. Wish they would sell it in stores again.</li>
</ol>
