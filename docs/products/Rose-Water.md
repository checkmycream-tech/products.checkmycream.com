<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using some type of rose water as a toner for quite some time now so when I was offered this  bottle during a promotion for my honest review I was happy to test it out.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived very quickly, was sealed very well and was not damaged.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells absolutely amazing. I have been using it for about a week and it did as I was expecting. Rose water toner is very gentle and natural. I love that this bottle is so big, I have even been using it during the day as a spritz to lift my spirits.&lt;br /&gt;Very high quality rose water.</li>
    <li> I have never had the pleasure of trying rose water for myself before I got this bottle of Rose Water Spray in the mail.  I was amazed at all of the ways it can be used.  You can even spray some in your food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a really big bottle with a spray top that worked fine.  The bottle is colored dark to preserve the water. It came perfectly sealed up with plastic from the manufacture.  I have already found so many uses for it.  It feels very refreshing sprayed on my face.  I also added it to my bath and it was very relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great natural product for anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for a discount in exchange for a fair and honest review.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I used to use other products that were either, too drying for my skin, or they just did not tone my skin at all.  Now, I use it every day and it keeps the moisture in my skin and still tones my skin very well.</li>
    <li> I have always had dry areas of skin on my face, above my eyebrows especially. I’ve tried lots of things but have never really found anything that I love. Until now. Rose water spray smells divine, the fact that it’s a mister is practical as well as refreshing. I use it as a cleanser or even to just spritz on my face to freshen up. It dries quickly and doesn’t leave my face looking greasy or shiny. My skin has definitely improved and it’s all thanks to Rose water spray. I will be purchasing some for gifts this Christmas that’s for sure.</li>
    <li> Hi, I have been using this product for quite sometimes with excellent results. I wanted to give you my review on it. First of all, it comes in a beautiful bottle and the spray that comes out of it is quite fine and feels amazingly great on the skin. I have been using this product as a natural face moisturizer that I apply right after the shower and wow does it works great at hydrating my dry skin. It feels so good on the skin that you just want to keep spraying this over and over again. The price is quite good and the shipping was really fast. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this natural moisturizer and recommend this product to everyone without a doubt.</li>
    <li> Got some of this for my girlfriend as random gift, and she&#x27;s very pleased with it. I can tell it&#x27;s not one of those things where she just pretends to use it to make me happy...she uses it on everything. She sprays it on the pillows at night (it does smell good) and she uses it after putting on her makeup. Apparently, it helps it &amp;#34;set,&amp;#34; but I have no clue what that means. She also uses it after work on nights where we immediately go out to dinner. Makes her look refreshed after the day is over.</li>
    <li> I do tons of organic recipes at home for my face, body and hair! Many recipes ask for this ingredient, so I got this and now i cant think of another product, I just love it - fast shipping and great service!</li>
    <li> As someone that tests and reviews products, I give honest feedback both to the consumer and the company that provides me with a discounted item. If I feel that a product is not worth my time, it will not make it this far and be sent back to the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a pretty big bottle of rose water. There&#x27;s no artificial fragrance or preservatives. 100% pure and natural. 8 fl oz. goes a long way too, so I&#x27;ll have this for awhile.  If you love the smell of roses then you will appreciate the fragrance of this.  The smell is intoxicating we will buying more of this when we run out.</li>
    <li> I love rosewater...this is great quality and i use it on my hair and face...i love the fact that its a fiant 8 oz squirt bottle</li>
    <li> This is great stuff, especially in the heat of the summer. Smells divine. Very refreshing. I&#x27;ll be buying this again! Also, very thoughtful follow-up from the company, which is rare these days.</li>
    <li> Receive stuff, very friendly, good!</li>
    <li> The product is lovely, and the seller even sent a message to thank me for ordering from them.  Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I love the water but the smell is a bit too strong for me</li>
    <li> very refreshing, feels like a rose garden. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This spray is great! I&#x27;ve used it several times now and I really like it! The company has THE BEST customer service and emailed me tips on different ways to use it. I will defenatly be re ording more.</li>
    <li> I just received this yesterday, but I can already tell this is what I&#x27;ve been looking for. I was using a brand that was sold at the spa I go to but they stopped carrying it so I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a replacement. I purchased another brand from amazon and it was horrible, it did everything I was expecting but the scent was so overpowering that I couldn&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;This brand, Eve Hansen is exactly what you expect from real, pure rose water. It&#x27;s light, it&#x27;s refreshing, and the price isn&#x27;t too bad. I got it on sale just because it happened to be on sale, not in exchange for a review, but even at $40 for 8 oz that&#x27;s twice the size that a lot of rose waters are sold at. I was paying $25 for half that.&lt;br /&gt;I started using rose water because I heard it can be good at calming rosacea, is a safe and natural make-up remover and helps set or activate foundation. So here is how I use it, after using my toner I spritz my face with rose water. If I&#x27;m wearing make-up after everything is applied and I&#x27;m ready, I do a spritz. At the end of the day if I need a pick me up, spritz. When I need to remove eye make up, obviously I don&#x27;t spritz, but apply to a cotton pad and remove, If it&#x27;s real heavy duty stuff this may not cut it, but for my needs this is usually fine.&lt;br /&gt;The only down side for me is that I wish the mist was a little finer and covered more area, I kinda feel like I&#x27;m squirting myself in the face with a squirt gun or something, but I can fix that easily by putting it in a different spray bottle.</li>
    <li> Beautiful Rose water, very gentle and refreshing. Love it</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the feel of this product. I also like to think my skin&#x27;s overall condition has improved since using this and the Vitamin C Serum a few weeks ago.</li>
    <li> I love Rosewater and how wonderful it is to give one a dewy look.</li>
    <li> High quality product. Fast shipping. Completely satisfied. Refreshing after effect , a big thumbs up !</li>
    <li> Recently, my sister bought me this rose water spray for my birthday.  My first impression was that it came in a pretty bottle and that it misted nicely without the nozzle getting clogged, also the rose scent was very refreshing!  I have been using this rose water spray as a mist after applying my moisturizer to give my face a dewy glow and also spraying it on my body after applying lotion to make my skin extra soft.  I love this product!  It dries nicely and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel slippery or wet (unlike some issues I had with another brand&#x27;s rose water spray) and the scent is great and is not over powering at all.  I&#x27;m glad that the first bottle was on my sister, but I will definetly be repurchasing on my own!</li>
    <li> I used this as a toner before bes, it makes my face feel really soft. It has a really lovely rose scent and makes me feel better overall, it’s great to use in bath water or your hair!</li>
    <li> I totally am in love with this Rose Water Spray, In ancient times, they used Rose Water as a toner, and I am so glad this natural beauty technique is available. I spray it on and I love the smell of the roses, and the way it feels so cool! My skin looks and feels amazing not to mention my husband loves it too! I highly recommend this delicious amazing Rose Water Spray to tone and refresh your face naturally!</li>
    <li> As someone that tests and reviews products, I give honest feedback both to the consumer and the company that provides me with a discounted item.  If I feel that a product is not worth my time, it will not make it this far and be sent back to the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use essential oils quite regularly.  I have made my own oil infused waters for my face for a couple of years now.  The one essential oil I can NOT afford is rose (it is currently at $525 for the real deal from a reputable vendor of oils...trust me, it&#x27;s a very tiny bottle. This is why things made with rose are so expensive, it takes an insane amount of petals to get to the oil)  This is a very fair price for an infused water.  I have had the opportunity to see and smell one bottle of the real thing once at my acupuncturist.  This smells like the oil I smelled back then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray on this is good.  It isn&#x27;t going to be like the mist on a high end face setting spray like you would get at the leading stand alone cosmetic chain but, this doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals and additives either so as someone that enjoys natural skin care, I would say that this is fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it as a refresher, a toner and a setting spray.  I think this would be a huge benefit for a person that travels and flies a lot.  The setting spray application will not fuss your makeup as long as you don&#x27;t drench yourself in it.  Rose is a very, very good thing to have in your arsenal and I feel that this is a good way to introduce aromatherapy into your skin regime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived on time and in good condition.  I did not contact the seller directly.</li>
    <li> This rose water smell so good. The smell is pure natural, just like the rose smell in my garden. After I put it on, my daughter compliment me, says I smell so good. This rose water has only one natural ingredient which I love. That&#x27;s distilled rose water. There is no other chemical or alcohol add to it that makes your face dry. Very natural. It makes my skin feeling very refresh, soft, and I feel like I am surround by rose.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It smells great and feels especially nice on your skin after you put it in the refrigerator. You can also spray it on your face over your make up without messing it up.</li>
    <li> I love this rose spray,especially around mid-afternoon when I&#x27;m starting to drag a bit.  I mist a few sprays onto my face and arms ... feels great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rose scent is light.  If you want something more like a perfume, this isn&#x27;t going to cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two other things I really like about this spray:&lt;br /&gt;1) I spray it on my face and it doesn&#x27;t disturb my makeup.  I don&#x27;t wear a ton ... mostly some liquid foundation.  If you wear powder makeup, this might not do as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The product claims to reduce redness, which I have on my arms from keratosis pilaris.  I have been trying to tell if this spray has reduced the redness of my bumpy arms.  So far, I&#x27;d say maybe a little, but not too much.  The redness is always a bigger problem in the winter, so I will need to update this review then.  I&#x27;ll get anything much better feel for the redness-reduction claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL, I recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product in exchange for a fair and honest review, which this is.</li>
    <li> I love this product and will be ordering again. However I wish you would put it in a pump bottle or a spray glass bottle. Smells wonderful and feels great on my skin. Well done product.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Just spray before and after applying make up... So good!!Smells great!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product. I live in over 100 degree weather, I put my rose water in the refrigerator and use it as a body spray. It&#x27;s heaven!</li>
    <li> I love it smells  so good</li>
    <li> Helps  a lot with pores! very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I love this rose water, it smells amazing, nice and dark bottle, arrived very quickly on time and I really like the communications from the seller to check on the order shipment and to ensure about the quality of every detail of the purchase and also he sent me interesting tips to use this toner. Best customer service. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Best rose-water spray. It has such a calm and comforting smell - on a summer day nothing else can refresh your face more.</li>
    <li> They have the most AMAZING customer service!! I would totally order from them again! I am very impressed.  Their rose water tonic is great! A++++++</li>
    <li> My skin can get pretty dehydrated pretty quickly and this 8oz Organic Rose Water Spray definitely helps a lot! I spray the Rose Water on my face when I get out of the shower and it makes my skin feel so much better. I love the scent of this Rose Water and I personally don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too strong. I love that this Rose Water Spray comes in a 8oz bottle so that it will last for quite awhile rather than the smaller bottles that you run out of pretty quickly. This is definitely the best Rose Water that I&#x27;ve ever used and I would for sure recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> I love this toner! It smells so good and feels very refreshing. I use it morning and night between my face wash and moisturizer. Good quality, and good customer service. I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing! I use it as a toner and a refresher for both my face and hair. Great scent.</li>
    <li> I LOVE my Organic Rose Water Spray!  The thing I use it most for is just spraying it on my face and chest.  It is so cool and refreshing and the smell is wonderful!  The other thing I loved is that I got an email from the company giving me tips on how to use the spray, so now I know even more ways to use this wonderful spray!</li>
    <li> I guess I wasn&#x27;t paying attention about the number of ounces at ordering but when I opened the box I was surprised by how large the bottle was. This stuff is awesome, I use it after cleansing all over my face and neck before getting into skin care products and randomly mist during the day as needed. Smells wonderful, like a giant bunch of roses, dries clean and soft. There&#x27;s nothing to dislike but plenty of uses and reasons to repurchase IF I ever run which might not be for a while...</li>
    <li> Received product on time.  Have only been using for a few days.  Not sure I&#x27;d use again due to cost--overprized for size but no complaints so far.  Good customer service</li>
    <li> Love it and the smell</li>
    <li> I love the scent of anything rose.  This product is gentle on my sensitive skin.  Winter will be the test!  I spray it on my skin several times a day and also use it on my hair.  My skin has never felt better.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time and was as a described. I usually stay away from rose scented products but I like the way this rosewater smells and it&#x27;s not too overwhelming. I use it as a refresher for my face on these hot humid days.</li>
    <li> I received this rose water spray as a gift from my fiancé and I love it. I use it as a cleanser and a toner on a daily basis, ever since I started using this on my face it has felt really hydrated and clean, it has also helped my pores diminish in size. This product helps my oily skin by removing the excess oil and leaving my have squeaky clean. The smell of this spray is so so so good, it helps me relax right before. I will be buying this for my sisters to help fight oily skin. This product is worth every penny and it is definitely money well spent.</li>
    <li> I went back and forth on which rose water to purchase and chose this one. Very happy with purchase. It smells wonderful and I can see a difference in my pores after a few days of use. Love that it comes in a fine mist spray bottle.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Ordered as described.  I love the fresh smell.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and makes my skin so soft!</li>
    <li> Love the quality and the price.</li>
    <li> I have REALLY dry skin and live in a really dry state so I suffer from constant dry skin. I decided to try this rose spray because it supposedly helped w/moisturizing skin and was great for sensitive skin. I didn&#x27;t think it was going to make a big difference in the beginning but I could feel a difference right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the rose scent but few hours later my husband told me my skin smelled like wilted flowers hahaha(gross). If you&#x27;re worried about smelling like wilted flowers you could just use it before going up bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like it and I recommend!!!</li>
    <li> This was a product I was interested in.  I didn&#x27;t purchase it, but it seemed to be of good quality from description.</li>
    <li> Already ordered another.Feels fantastic on my face and smells fabulous. Already bought a second bottle.</li>
    <li> This rose water is amazing, it makes my skin feel sooo soft! I recommend trying it to anyone</li>
    <li> Ordered a bottle for my wife&#x27;s birthday.  She&#x27;s a Latina, a set who are keen on appearance.  She liked it immediately, claimed that it felt great on her face and seemed to aid the health of her skin.  And she liked its scent; got close to me so that I could test it.  Very pleasant indeed.</li>
    <li> I love rosewater for my facial toner and use it daily.  This rose water smells delightful and is organic--perfect.  After I clean my face in the morning I spray the rose water on my cleansed skin and then use a small cotton pad to wipe gently clean.  My skin is now perfect for serums, moisturizers and make up.  I do the same routine every evening.  I am a woman of a certain age and I have so many compliments on my skin!</li>
    <li> Smells nice. Easy to just spray on. Too early to see any lasting benefits.</li>
    <li> Another great experience with Even Hansen. This is my 5th purchase from this seller. I love the free and fast shipping. I have only contacted them with compliments and they returned my emails in a timely matter. This is my first time buying the rose water and I will be back for more. I also highly recommend the Argan and Sweet Almond Oils; they leave my skin so silky smooth. Sometimes I use this oil directly from the bottle and sometimes I add them to my homemade soaps, lotions, body scrubs and bug bite treatments.</li>
    <li> Great, light rose scent, its not a perfume so dont expect the scent to last all day, I wouldn&#x27;t want it to really. Love that it is a spray.  I use this one in conjunction with another OZ Naturals toner.  I rotate them use one during the day and one at night. You can even use this one on your hair, so when I use this one I give my whole body a nice spritz.  Very gentle, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Keeps me hydrated, toned, and feeling fresh all day/night.  My boyfriend even likes to steal a spritz here and there! Great product</li>
    <li> First of all I just wanted to say that this is the best rose water I have EVER received. The smell is phenomenal and I like the fact that it came in a dark amber bottle. I normally use this as a toner after I finish washing my face with Vitamin C Cleanser and I&#x27;ve noticed that this tightens my pores and leaves my skin incredibly soft. I&#x27;m definitely going to buy this again!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is as good if not better than the expensive brands. Fast delivery too.</li>
    <li> This is such a nice and refreshing spray! It&#x27;s a large bottle so it will last you quite a while. I spray it on my  face at night before going to bed and it feels wonderful! The smell is great, not too strong, but strong enough to relax you. I received this product at a discounted rate (not free) for my honest and unbiased opinion. I love it! I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> Fabulous product! Love the scent and feel of it on my skin. Bought it to use as a facial refresher during flights, but I&#x27;m so happy with it I use it daily, to give my skin a pick-me-up in the middle of the day, and a spritz before my usual skin care products. Now I don&#x27;t think I can live without it!  More please!</li>
    <li> This is very nice. I keep it my refrigerator to get even a cooler spray. Just a little pick me up during the day. Refreshing.  Wish it came in travel size</li>
    <li> Great product , great service :)</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Where in live it&#x27;s been hit and humid.  I keep this in fridge and every morning I wash my face then spray with rose water.  During day if I&#x27;m not wearing makeup I spray my face again. It has made my skin really soft and feeling great. At night after my facial routine I end with this product.  What&#x27;s nice is I&#x27;m having surgery on my shoulder so washing my face will be difficult.  I&#x27;ll be without makeup and use this to keep my skin looking great. I will continue to buy from this company. Excellent customer service as well.</li>
    <li> Oh how I love Eva Hansen! Her quality is A++ this is another great product of hers! cleared up my acne fast!</li>
