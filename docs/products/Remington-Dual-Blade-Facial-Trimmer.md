      <li>/&gt;Don&#x27;t think this is good for nose -</li>
      <li>It has good battery life, and I still have the manufacturer&#x27;s battery.</li>
      <li>Maybe because I&#x27;ve had good luck with Remington products over the years (I am not being compensated for this, or in any way connected with Remington).</li>

      <li>Very pleased with it.</li>
      <li>The price is right and it is just the perfect size for trimming.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product if you need a good close-cutting, fast nose clipper.</li>

      <li>Thank you for a great product and very quick delivry.</li>
      <li>No problems with attachments, everything works nicely.  </li>
      <li>It does a very good job of trimming while it is working right.  </li>
      <li>It rips the hair out rather than cut it, unless I squeeze the top of the blades together, then it works ok, but not convenient to have to use both hands!</li>
      <li>and I honestly havnt found a better tool to replace it.</li>
      <li>This one actually truely cuts nose hairs!!</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
      <li>Easy to store - love that it came with a battery!</li>
      <li>Very light and convenient trimmer.</li>
      <li>Very cheaply made so</li>
      <li>This is a very precise trimmer.</li>
      <li>luckily, someone had a link to this gadget and everyone LOVED how it worked.</li>
      <li>Guess I was spoiled by my very old Avon one that worked incredibly well.</li>
      <li>Cannot really say this is the best product since this the first of its kind I bought, hence the 4 stars.  </li>
      <li>Work great but certainly</li>
      <li>The Remington is much better.</li>
      <li>mostly use these things on my eyebrows.  </li>
      <li>The light is handy too for intensive areas.  </li>
      <li>sure miss</li>
      <li>But I love it.</li>
      <li>I will probably chuck it out and get a better one.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much more of a challenge to trim your nose hairs because of the linear edged design compared to the trimmers with the circular tip.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It works ok.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m 98% sure that this item is going to get returned.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m no longer within the timeframe to be able to return it.  </li>
      <li>check the battery to make sure it&#x27;s in there correctly.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for much more.</li>
      <li>Pleased with it.</li>
      <li>it was ok, but&lt;br /</li>
      <li>I even read all the reviews and thought it would be ok.  </li>
      <li>Seems like more men are using the Remington.  </li>
      <li>Now, I hope to find one that trims as well, but is more reliable to work well all the time.</li>
      <li>Works OK.</li>
      <li>This is better than the one we replaced.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had MUCH better luck with the [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>I want to give a star review I just dont want to write alot  if I give it a 5 star review that means I love it and would recommend it.</li>
      <li>The remington Mpt3500 facial trimmer is the best trimmer we have tried.</li>
      <li>I should try replacing the battery it came with, maybe it will work better.  </li>
      <li>I have used these forever and love them.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t blow my nose without causing more bleeding, ever after a night&#x27;s sleep.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Waste of money. Buy a better trimmer.</li>
    <li> I get these type of trimmers to shape my eyebrows since waxing/tweezing is inconvenient.  This worked well for what I needed it for. I just used it for eyebrows, and nothing else. It did not last very long though. The first issue was the battery seemed to run down very fast. Motor was ok on a brand new battery, but by the second shave it would start to lose power. Then after about two months, I tried to turn it on and it just would not start. Put in a new battery, and still would not start. Not even a putter. After fiddling around with it for a bit, I still could not get it to start. When it was working, it was a good little shaver....when it was working that is. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it though since it seems to die very quickly.</li>
    <li> broke almost right away</li>
    <li> I had an older version of this trimmer that worked great but stopped working after a couple years. It never cut me even once. I bought this one and it works even better. They do break after a while so you have to replace them but they work very well.</li>
    <li> I bought this on Amazon after checking out the reviews of this &amp; devices like it, prompted when I watched an impressive TV commercial of the Microtouch. I&#x27;m of Mediterranean descent and &#x27;blessed&#x27; with lots of increasingly-as-I-age bushy eyebrow, nose and ear hair, and I&#x27;ve been tediously trimming the above for many years with scissors and razors, blade and electric. Got hopeful of a better way when I saw the infomercial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why this particular instrument? Maybe because I&#x27;ve had good luck with Remington products over the years (I am not being compensated for this, or in any way connected with Remington). This trimmer is actually fun to use to remove nose and ear hair. Just insert into nostril &amp; rotate gently, and the hair is cut very nicely and painlessly-- beats sticking scissors up my nose and ever-so-carefully trying to cut the hairs without poking myself. Also trims eyebrows easily with the comb attachment-- much easier than using scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for only about a month, so I can&#x27;t say anything about longevity/durability.  It&#x27;s a small instrument, pen-sized (very portable) and so all the parts are small and should be handled carefully, gently. I&#x27;m surprised at how well this works for such a low price, and so I give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update on 10/4/11: Using it a couple months now. Between uses it seems to clog or stick,  so that when I next try to use it, it won&#x27;t run. I thought the battery died, but no, when I took the head off and gently wiped the cutters on a tissue, it started right up and ran fine after reassembly, every time. This is an inconvenience, but a minor one, so I leave the five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 7/12: Jamming too frequently now. Bought a Panasonic Vortex last month for $12.48 that I like MUCH better for trimming nose &amp; ear hair. My review is online at Amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought it mainly as a nose hair trimmer, which becomes a problem area when you get into your forties. It cuts most hair well enough, but it feels really ticklish and uncomfortably scarey inside your nose. It will cut the hair in your nose, but you really don&#x27;t want to put it in there for very long.</li>
    <li> Great price for a durable product. Remington has done it again. The product works well on any surface. Thanks remington.</li>
    <li> Before this, I bought a Panasonic ER430 [[ASIN:B000FYVOJC Panasonic ER430K Vacuum Nose/Facial Hair Trimmer, Black]] and was disappointed since even after routing around in my nose for over 10 mins, it wouldnt get everything. It would actually leave a lot of hairs fairly long. After a few months I bought this at Target (it&#x27;s actually cheaper here, but I was impatient).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it in my nose, and it was ridiculously fast, easy, and got everything! Took me less than a minute! The clippers on this model are different than the Panasonic which made a huge difference. The Panasonic is one of those round head trimmers. You feel nothing, but they almost cut nothing. This was scratchier in my nose, but far from painful. I didnt even sneeze. Excellent product if you need a good close-cutting, fast nose clipper. Doing the ears with this is the same. Great.</li>
    <li> REMINGTON TRIMMER IS BEST i HAVE USED.Durable and close-trimming blades. Slim style of trimmer makes it very easy to use of nose, ear or other close or detailed trimming.</li>
    <li> The remington Mpt3500 facial trimmer is the best trimmer we have tried. It does exactly what we bought it for. We would definetly recommend as a trimmer for places razor does not work well.</li>
    <li> Very light and convenient trimmer. Why I didn&#x27;t buy it earlier :)))It makes my skin clean and does not irritate.</li>
    <li> This is like any average trimmer nothing special. It works fine and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it thus far. It gets the job done when it comes to trimming my facial hair. I like this trimmer but, can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m in love seeing as I had my old trimmer for a few years and had no problems until it blades stop working. However I would recommend this trimmer because, it gets the job done which is the most important part.</li>
    <li> Stop working after two weeks, and consumed a lot of battery. Ending buying different brand and wasted money for no reason. will work for few days for sure</li>
    <li> Does the job but very flimsy.</li>
    <li> A piece of junk -- even with a new battery, the blades tug at your hair painfully rather than cut cleanly.</li>
    <li> Works well, when it works.  Remington should work on the quality control.</li>
    <li> broke, stopped working after 3 uses...</li>
    <li> Works ok, but it broke after about 5 uses.  Had to tape it together to continue use.  It was inexpensive, so I guess I got what I paid for...</li>
    <li> this product did not last long blades got slow did not stay sharp</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s compact and does a great job! I&#x27;ve used other trimmers that were painful to use, this is easy and pain free! Definitely would recommend using this to others!</li>
    <li> We had one of these trimmers for years and years and it finally pooped out. We went online to see if they still even make the same kind and of course Amazon had it. It is the best one we have ever used. The price is right and it is just the perfect size for trimming.  It works very well on men&#x27;s eyebrows, ears, noses, around beards because it is easy to control. I have to admit it works very well on my stray \\&quot;mustache\\&quot; hairs as well. I hope they never stop making this trimmer just in case my new one dies one day!! I would highly recommend this trimmer!!</li>
    <li> I have used other trimmers and they were just so - so. But low and behold this one really does the job. And at a very fair price.</li>
    <li> I am not reviewing about the build quality because i have spent $8 and not expecting any excellent build quality but one thing i want to say is the build is not disappointing.   The reason for 5 stars is it works greatly, it trims my side burns like a professional. I will buy another one for my wife when i will return back to my country ;)  I will recommend this.</li>
    <li> I searched for this item in stores to replace my broken one. No luck my last choice which should have been my first was to look in amazon. Com to my amazement they had this item.. What a relief from then on out I go to amazon first skip all hassles in going to department stores and malls to find an item. With one click amazon will find what your looking for!! Never failed me. Thank you amazon</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a birthday present, and was very disappointed to find that it did not work! I tried replacing the batteries, but this did not help, what a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Just received and used my new Remington MPT3500 that arrived days ahead of the scheduled delivery date.  Just as I expected from a Remington product, this unit is a solid replacement for my long serving MicroTouch.  The MPT3500 is clearly more powerful than the original MicroTouch which makes for quicker desired results.  I used the new trimmer for the #1 grooming job it was purchased to do and that is to trim the unsightly/sometimes unruly nose hair(s) that men are prone to sprout during our \\&quot;maturing\\&quot; years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The MPT3500 worked like a champ!  I will eventually use this trimmer with the guard on it to groom the fine hairs that grow on the outter ridges of my ears as well (just as the TV commercial presents).  I am certain it should handle that job with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For less than $8 (on sale) delivered to my door, this was a no brainer purchase.  With a 2 year mfg warranty and a 30 day satisfaction guarantee, Remington has removed all risk to the buyer to try this worthy product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most of my reviews, I will attempt to give an update down the road that speaks to the longevity of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002D1MZ34 Remington Mpt3500 Dual Blade Facial Trimmer]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  10/13/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still working.  Like the post after mine states, you occasionally have to take the head off and clean it but it will fire apback up again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the $8 bucks I paid, it has far exceeded expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  This unit is selling for $20 now.  Buy low like they say.</li>
    <li> From the day I received this product it never worked. I&#x27;m very disappointed with quality. The first time I turned it on the head and blades flew off. It was difficult to put back together and still doesn&#x27;t work. If I had a way to get a refund I would. Would not suggest buying this item.</li>
    <li> I have PCOS, which unfortunately causes excessive facial hair.  It&#x27;s a bummer, but there are worse things that could happen to a person.  I&#x27;m not encouraging or discouraging facial hair shaving for women, but for me ... this is my best option for now.  I&#x27;ve been told over and over NOT to shave my face in any way.  I seem to get basically the same results with waxing - but with waxing you have to wait too long between having a smooth face, and you have to endure the pain or discomfort.  Plucking all the little extras I have on my chin and neck is about like plucking my legs instead of shaving them.  Not a fun night.  THIS is quick and painless, and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I&#x27;m not sure yet what happens when the blades dull, but for the price ... I wouldn&#x27;t mind just replacing it or having an extra on hand.</li>
    <li> Eric&#x27;s review nailed it and offered a solution so here is a copy of his review... It works very well IF IT TURNS ON. Within a month, it would stop turning on and I would have change the battery or tap it. Turns out the electrical contact on the bottom of the battery is poorly designed. It has no spring. It&#x27;s a thin metal plate with a bump on it. It loses contact. I&#x27;ll try to remove it and bend it now that I&#x27;ve figured it out, but many people will waste at least one battery and throw the trimmer in the trash before figuring this out. It&#x27;s a simple flaw and simple fix but, to most people, the whole product becomes trash. It also wastes a good battery which totally ruined the worth of this thing.</li>
    <li> Thank you for a great product and very quick delivry. It does all you say it does, and I waas skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be back!</li>
    <li> I use rechargeable batteries in things like this when I can, so I was disappointed to read in the instructions they will not work with these. I have been doing so anyway, but the motor runs much slower (too slow). I guess I will go back to using a Micro Touch which works well enough with rechargeables. It looks to me like it&#x27;s performance would be adequate with alkalines.</li>
    <li> My wife has had nothing but trouble with this trimmer.  After only three uses it keeps coming apart when she&#x27;s trying to use it.  It&#x27;s a piece of cheap junk.</li>
    <li> You can tell by the sound of this thing when it will work and not work.&lt;br /&gt;If you hear it fast and steady, trim.&lt;br /&gt;If you hear it slowing down, stop trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replaced batteries and doesn&#x27;t help. I even reoiled the blades, etc without any success. I think this is cheaply made and should be treated as a disposable trimmer. BTW, a cheap knock off can be bought at your local &#x27;as seen on tv&#x27; section of your local store / pharmacy that will do the same thing for less. So in this case: Accept immitations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even want to bother with the warranty. I wonder if Remmington planned it that way?</li>
    <li> Based on previous product reviews, I thought this would be a decent hair trimmer. I&#x27;ve had less than 5 months and I didn&#x27;t use but maybe once a month and it has stopped trimming and is now tearing - OUCH!</li>
    <li> I was a bit disappointed when I first removed it from the package. The tip was cracked and the whole device is covered in cheap plastic. If you flip the on and off switch to hard it would literally break! The blades do seem more durable than all the other similar trimmers I have used. It trims nose and eye brow hair with ease. It struggles a bit with the beard but still out does the competition. Overall the price is right for this product as long as it stays in one piece. C+ for the weak plastic covering.</li>
    <li> This product looked like an old one I had, except this one looked plain silver in the picture but I got a purple-ish color with a girly design on it.  It rips the hair out rather than cut it, unless I squeeze the top of the blades together, then it works ok, but not convenient to have to use both hands!</li>
    <li> My title pretty much sums how I feel about this product.  Cannot really say this is the best product since this the first of its kind I bought, hence the 4 stars.  I may edit this review later on if I ever a similar product.</li>
    <li> I had a MicroTouch for a few years, but that kept breaking down. I&#x27;d jiggle it, put in a new battery, and it would slowly creak back to life. But it was never very strong. The Remington Personal Trimmer looks like the MicroTouch, but the motor is stronger and you get a much more effective, though still safe, cut. It comes with a little plastic piece you can place over the razor and use it for sideburns. I just tried it on my moustache and it works great. I&#x27;d use caution here, though! My moustache is thick, and it thinned it out a little. You&#x27;ll probably want to test it out on sideburns before using on a moustache. For me it&#x27;s a lot handier than pulling out my old beard/moustache trimmer.</li>
    <li> I have had this trimmer for about 8 months now and have no complaints, I haven&#x27;t even cleaned it and it still works like a charm. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have lost count of how many of these I have purchased. It is VERY cheaply made and will NOT last more than a few months of regular use. They literally will fall apart and the battery contacts fall out as they are not held in place very well. As far as performance goes it does perform well and is great for shaping beards and trimming side burns. The only reason I have bought so many even when I know how cheap they are is because they are cheap price wise and I honestly havnt found a better tool to replace it. I just wish they made a premium version that was sturdier because I WOULD pay more for a better build. My star rating is based on build quality but if I was rating the performance it would get a 5.</li>
    <li> I have used this monthly for trimming my eyebrows.  Then the last couple of times, it started being intermittent.  Changed the batteries, no go.  The mechanical shaft seems to have gave out, and will not move the blade.  Back to looking for something else.</li>
    <li> Worked well while it lasted, but this one is like so many others I have had,  One day, they just stop working and don&#x27;t turn on anymore inexplicably.  I have since gotten a Philips and it has lasted for more than two years with no problems.</li>
    <li> Lasted 6 months then quit. Seems poorly designed and constructed. Looks and feels cheap. Blade does not hold consistently in place and would easily fall out of its holder.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend always complains about the hair that grows down his neck. He hates how hard it is to shave on his own and always asked why he couldnt just have a normal hairline. I was going to buy the microtouch max for him after seeing it on an infomercial, but when i looked at the reviews hardly anyone had anything good to say about it. luckily, someone had a link to this gadget and everyone LOVED how it worked. The reviews were awesome. I have only good things to say. It works like its supposed to and my bf even uses it to tame his eyebrows and there is no more complaining! Groomed boyfriend + no complaining &#x3D; happy me :)I would suggest this to anyone. Even for the ladies!</li>
    <li> Pack carefully as these are made of cheap plastic and may not travel well unless wrapped in a towel or clothing to protect them.  Work great but certainly not cheap for something so cheaply made.  Does not pull hair while cutting like poorly made scissors.</li>
    <li> The first one delivered did not work initially, then it was off and on--sometimes it turned on, other times it did not.  So I exchanged for a replacement and it works everytime and works very well.  I wish it were a little smaller diameter like the Conair featured, which looks like the model I was using with tape (haha) but, I did not order this time after reading a negative review.  It is more slender in the hand which I like and why I did not buy the current light up model in stores now, which are too bulky.  Amazon CS made the exchange easy.</li>
    <li> batteries died soon after I got it, replaced them and after fiddling around with the thing I got it to work</li>
    <li> I replaced one that I had bought from Avon years ago that had finally died. This one works great and the price is great too.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s hard to find a high quality grooming product, now you have! Dual mirco blades help clean up all the places hair should not grow. Buy extra AAA batteries.</li>
    <li> good except it is not flexible</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a MicroTouch I&#x27;ve had for years. The Remington is much better. The motor is faster, and overall it feels like a sturdier product. I was hesitant to buy it at first, but I&#x27;m really glad I did. If you&#x27;re looking to replace a MicroTouch, I highly recommend the Remington Mpt3500.</li>
    <li> I noticed soon that when hurrying to get ready for work I often hit the blade release instead of the on/off switch, letting the blade fall into the sink and almost down the drain. I fixed that with a bit of tape. Ugly but effective. It worked very well for several months but now will no longer cut.</li>
    <li> I use mine for female personal grooming \\&quot;down there\\&quot;.  This little thing works surprisingly well.  You have to work at it a bit, but it gets the job done.  The two lengths are perfect.  I especially like the size - it&#x27;s about the size of a tube of mascara.  For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  UPDATE:  Unfortunately the two that I bought and used for a couple months both broke.  I&#x27;m reducing the number of stars based on this.</li>
    <li> I bought this so I could keep my eyebrows trimmed, and so that my husband could touch up after a shave. It is durable from what I can tell because he dropped it twice and it runs like a dream. The battery came included, so that was a plus. It is relatively quiet for a trimmer, the color is clean and pleasant, and the item works great. I had a Personal Touch trimmer for years, but it finally went kerplunk on me, so I wanted to give this trimmer a shot. I&#x27;m very pleased with it and would recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> First of all, it&#x27;s a decent trimmer for its price. It does its job, and makes very clean shaves for sideburns, nose hair, ear hair, etc. However, it is very flimsy and there are multiple instances where it didn&#x27;t work because the bathroom was a bit steamy or there was a bit of hair on the blade. I would recommend that you go for one of the more expensive ones, because it is not as flimsy and more reliable.</li>
    <li> I have had this trimmer for several years.  It does a very good job of trimming while it is working right.  However, the on/off switch would often conk out, and so I would have to wiggle the switch around to get it to work again.  In addition, there must be hairs that got inside because within a year, it would slow down much more quickly on a full Alkaline battery.  I would remove the detachable half tip and clean that part about once every couple weeks, but there is no way to get into the motor area unless you want to break it.  Finally, I got tired of its very slow speed and threw it away a couple days ago.  Now, I hope to find one that trims as well, but is more reliable to work well all the time.</li>
    <li> Horrible!  Worst piece of garbage ever!  Dont waste your money on this one.  I even read all the reviews and thought it would be ok.  It&#x27;s not.</li>
    <li> For the price, I am sure you could not find a better little hair trimmer. It take a bit practicing but when you get the hand on it goes 1-2-3.</li>
    <li> Updated 12/22/11&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little impatient to receive this item because, well, I needed to trim my nose hairs as my other trimmer died. So I was disappointed when after inserting the included battery and turning it on....nothing happened. That&#x27;s right. Brand new item and battery and the first time I try to power it up it doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I check the battery to make sure it&#x27;s in there correctly. It is. So what&#x27;s wrong? Then I remembered reading a review on here that said he/she had to tap the trimmer in their hands sometimes to turn it on. I try that and it promptly powers up. Ok that&#x27;s a very bad sign and I&#x27;m 98% sure that this item is going to get returned. But since I have it I might as well try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works ok. It&#x27;s much more of a challenge to trim your nose hairs because of the linear edged design compared to the trimmers with the circular tip. It&#x27;s also harder when trying to cut the hairs in the middle of your nostril as you have to constantly chop at it at an angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But of course I didn&#x27;t just buy it for the nose trimmer. I wanted it for the facial trimmer. And for minor body grooming. Even though it&#x27;s not advertised as a body groomer I figured it shouldn&#x27;t have a problem with that. And it doesn&#x27;t. It also works decently for sideburns. Haven&#x27;t tried it on eyebrows yet as mine are just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the powering on problem is most likely a dealbreaker. I haven&#x27;t decided yet. It was only 8 bucks but I feel the problem will eventually get worse and I&#x27;ll end up having to smack this thing on the table to get it working. It&#x27;s poor quality and it feels kinda cheap too. I think it also lacks power because I had to repeatedly chop at my nose hairs to cut them and it still had trouble trimming them. I don&#x27;t recommend this and suggest you look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After using this for almost 2 months I&#x27;ve decided to upgrade this from 2 stars to 3. Even though there&#x27;s still the power-up issue, I now prefer using this blade design because it doesn&#x27;t grind your nose hairs into a million tiny bits like the circular tip trimmers do. The cut hairs come out easier and cleaning up your nose afterwards is faster and you don&#x27;t have to dig out the hairs as much or constantly blow your nose. It&#x27;s also not as hard to trim as I thought. Gently rubbing the blade along is the key. If I could find a higher quality trimmer of this design I&#x27;d buy it instead of the circular tip ones.rs into a million tiny bits like the circular tip trimmers do.

    <li> Shaves great.  Does exactly what the description says. Shaves close and clean.  Will nick if not careful, but only because holding it wrong.  Great value for the price.  Only wish there was a holder for the comb so it won&#x27;t get misplaced. Will buy more.</li>
    <li> This little trimmer is great. I could hope for a decent service life, but for the price, I don&#x27;t expect much. I can&#x27;t help but laugh at the reviews of people slamming it for being cheap, like it&#x27;s a $50 trimmer or something. It does a great job on mustache trimming and nose hair mowing. I don&#x27;t use the guard it comes with so n/a on comments about it. It feels cheap and brittle, but it hasn&#x27;t broken yet, plus it IS cheap. Quit wasting your time shopping for similar products and just buy this one. It works like it&#x27;s supposed to. At this price, just buy two if you are concerned that it might fail.</li>
    <li> It works very well if it turns on. Within a month, it would stop turning on and I would have change the battery or tap it. Turns out the electrical contact on the bottom of the battery is poorly designed. It has no spring. It&#x27;s a thin metal plate with a bump on it. It loses contact. I&#x27;ll try to remove it and bend it now that I&#x27;ve figured it out, but many people will waste at least one battery and throw the trimmer in the trash before figuring this out. It&#x27;s a simple flaw and simple fix but, to most people, the whole product becomes trash. It also wastes a good battery which totally ruined the worth of this thing.</li>
    <li> not the best one I have purchased ... but not the worse either.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use because I am getting laser hair removal and during my treatments I can no longer wax.  I use this primarily on my face and I love the results.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I had one of those \\&quot;as seen on TV\\&quot; models and it was a joke compared to this little shaver. At the price I paid for it, i could buy one a couple of times a year and not feel bad about it. So far it does exactly what it should without any tugging or pulling, without any razor burn. But, I&#x27;m using it on my lip area, I have no idea how it might do on the delicate bikini area. If you&#x27;re looking for something to make you less hirsute, this is the dealio. It gets close, comfortably. And that makes me happy, since ripping my mustache out is not something I want to do any longer. (not that I have a mustache, but if I did, this would be a great purchase) (I just told the entire Amazon world that I have a mustache...glarg)</li>
    <li> I use this for ears, facial hairs.. Sometimes for  sideburns &amp; eyebrows..&lt;br /&gt;Looks cheap (plasticky) but works great.. Easy to clean..&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t think this is good for nose - I use Panasonic vacuum trimmer..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had other personal shavers in the past, and this one is not as good as the others. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t remember the exact model number of this others, and this looked like those from the picture. It&#x27;s not. I think this is the model under those that I have had. But it works like it should, just not as great as others I have had.</li>
    <li> Good little trimmer and was suprised how well it works.  Good for eye brows and  nose hairs.  EAsy to use and good power for the small AAA batteries it uses.</li>
    <li> Only purchase this item if you are seeking a facial groomer that will stop operating after only a few uses. Worthless junk! Wish I had the original package so I could return it to CVS.</li>
    <li> I researched this on Amazon and a friend purchased it for me with a Norelco shaver. He shaver is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is sleek and ergonomic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a tiny power switch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It powers on rarely even with new battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nose trimmer pulls and is uncomfortable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used it for eyebrows, ears and the back of the head, maybe performs better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems to be equivalent to model on TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend buying this for yourself or a friend on Anazon, as was done for me.</li>
    <li> I had purchased it for my wife. She was very happy with the product as it was handy and she could carry anywhere and use it when needed. It worked fine about 2 years, and then suddenly it just stopped working. Now I am planning to buy another, this time the Panasonic one, hope it lasts longer.</li>
    <li> The only minor complaint I have is that it&#x27;s hard to close it once the battery is in. Given the price and functionality, that wouldn&#x27;t be enough to detract me from buying another one. The last one I owned (same model, more or less) lasted for around 6-7 years, and this one&#x27;s actually higher quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very picky with nose trimmers, this is a &#x27;solid&#x27; and well built high quality trimmer. Works so well I didnt even feel it working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  broke after just 2 months... stay away</li>
    <li> I guess what do you expect for a motorized item selling for $7.99 that includes mfg and marketing cost, shipping to the US, shipping to me.  It literally exploded into numerous parts on a low impact fall without any chance of reassembly.  It fell when attempting to separate the trimmer from an impossibly difficult theft proof plastic container.</li>
    <li> The Remington is a solid piece of workmanship. Initially you may have to tap it a few times or shimmy the battery until the unit gets \\&quot;settled\\&quot;. It cuts very well keeping my goatee in shape and conquering my nasal issues.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Finishing Touch Trimmer, which served me well for years until the blade guide finally broke.  This Remington Trimmer is very similar, except it has a wide blade (about like the one on Finishing Touch) on one side of the head and a narrow blade on the other side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between the two trimmers, Finishing Touch is a little more gentle, but it&#x27;s not nearly as quick as the Remington.  The Remington has power, but it also scratches my skin, even when I have it on the long hair setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Finishing Touch has a pivoting head.  I don&#x27;t see that on the Remington.  On the other hand, the Remington has the narrow blade, for more precise cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mostly use these things on my eyebrows.  I like the speed of the Remington and can ignore the scratching.  However, if you prefer something more gentle, Finishing Touch might be a better choice.</li>
    <li> Who tells young men that one of the joys of becoming an old man is that hair spontaneously begins growing from your nose and ears? Apparently I missed that memo. Finding myself in need of a trimmer, and having purchased a Remington beard trimmer not so long ago (see other reviews) I figured I&#x27;d stick with a winner. Not at all disappointed by this unit. It&#x27;s very small but seems sturdy enough and only requires one AAA battery to use. It&#x27;s easy and smooth to operate, and the blades are guarded well so you won&#x27;t have any unnecessary injuries. Used once...so far, so good.</li>
    <li> Gets those tiny face hairs - no irritation and quick and easy to use (and store).  It comes with 2 different blades.  Although I haven&#x27;t tried the smaller one for eyebrows, the larger one works great.</li>
    <li> Worked pretty good for a while. Then it started to slow down and get dull. Tried new batteries but that only helped a little. May try something else or may order several and use them as disposable when they break.</li>
    <li> Works well, but a little bit fragile.</li>
    <li> I have had it only a year and it is already broken. the top split in half and it is not even used that often.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer to replace the one I bought a local superstore.  I had problems with that one rusting after 2 months of use.  More than a year later, this one is still running strong.  I can run it under the water to clean it without any problems.  The light is handy too for intensive areas.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works great for facial hair.</li>
    <li> was delivered on time with no damage, works pretty good on one AAA battery, and trims the unwanted hair every were pretty good.</li>
    <li> I just ordered this less than a week ago. What arrived was a purple Remington - you know, the &amp;#34;for her&amp;#34; variety. It seems to work fine thus far (I have no complaints about how it operates), but I had to give it four stars simply because it isn&#x27;t really what I ordered.</li>
    <li> I works well and very handy.  I have only had it a few weeks and time will only tell how it holds up.  The only reason I don&#x27;t give it a perfect score is the little hair guide attachment can be difficult to get on and off... but it works well.</li>
    <li> Drains batteries and the bottom part that connects the battery for power broke since you really have to force it to open. I bent it back into place but always causes a problem when having to change the battery. Would not buy again</li>
    <li> it was not a star performer, but its performance could be described as adequate. It died with light use maybe once every 2 months. It didnt even last 3 years.</li>
    <li> Completely dead after five weeks of random usage. Garbage. I would recommend buying something else. These types of trimmers are disposable, but this one should be thrown away in the package.</li>
    <li> This is a very precise trimmer. It does nose hair, sideburns and most importantly, eyebrows with ease. Its a great item to have in my drawer. I reccommend it, but it seems a bit fragile.</li>
    <li> works very well.&lt;br /&gt;i have had one for about 5 years . it was ok, but&lt;br /&gt; new one has four times the power of my old one.&lt;br /&gt;i like it so well i am going to buy another for a spare.</li>
    <li> Not as powerful as I would have liked and the color is a bit misleading but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time.  It&#x27;s easy to use for trimming and even styling hair.  The only draw-back is that its life-span is short.</li>
    <li> This item has met my expectations! I am honestly surprised that this facial trimmer doesn&#x27;t leave any cuts! The thing I love about it is that it has a small side along with a larger side, its really convenient.  Now I can finally say goodbye to those horrible hair removal creams!</li>
    <li> Does a nice job, though I&#x27;ve only used it once so far.  I&#x27;ll be back to change the review if problems develop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6 months later:  used it last night and it cut the inside of my nose.  Been bleeding off and on ever since.  Can&#x27;t blow my nose without causing more bleeding, ever after a night&#x27;s sleep. Don&#x27; know what happened.  Just a warning to others, if you use it for nasal hair.</li>
    <li> For some reason the battery has issues and sometimes you turn it on and nothing happens. You have to beat it a couple times for it to go and sometimes it runs slow. I&#x27;ve had a similar one sold under a different brand and had the same issue. It&#x27;s cheap and it shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, I give this three stars not because it deserves them, but because most of the other low-budget options are so much worse. For a cheap trimmer (let&#x27;s face it, we are talking nose hair here), this one works quite well, and far better than any with a circular-shape blade end. It&#x27;s far from perfect, but it&#x27;s far better than anything else that costs less than $20. And unless you need daily maintenance, this is probably all you need.</li>
    <li> Works well but only last a few months then you have to buy a new one. Very cheaply made so i have to agree with the other low raters</li>
    <li> Not perfect!  Item works well but lock to hold top part on is not solid and if not solid causes the top to fall off when used.</li>
    <li> I hate to say it but Best Buy has the same item for under $10.00 online. I have gone through 4 of these over the years. If you look closely at the instructions on this model it will say it is not made for nose hairs (I think that is because all the other nose hair&lt;br /&gt;trimmers have a small guard on them), but that&#x27;s the problem with the others! This one actually truely cuts nose hairs!! I am so glad that they still make these! Take a chance buy one of these then buy one of the other &amp;#34;nose&amp;#34; trimmers and you&#x27;ll see what I am talking about!!</li>
    <li> My friend told me about this. She had bought hers at the dollar store and it was a bit cheaper. But I love it. I use it for my mustache hairs, which are mainly blonde but I prefer them gone. It works great. My husband has even used it for his nose hairs.</li>
    <li> This little trimmer worked fine for a little bit. I&#x27;ve only had it 3 months and now the top section keeps opening. I have to hold it closed to use it. I will probably chuck it out and get a better one. The one I had previously worked for years with no problem.</li>
    <li> Cuts great after a month or two won&#x27;t work, if Remington could address this issue it would be a perfect trimmer.</li>
    <li> The trimmer does not work. A lot of problem to start</li>
    <li> this thing works very well but i dropped it in a bit of water on time when it wasn&#x27;t even on and it shorted out. if you can keep it dry it works great though</li>
    <li> Does not trim hair.  I do not like the trimmer at all.  I don&#x27;t know who this would work for!</li>
    <li> it works it cuts my nasty nose and ear hair can also be used to trim the pubies they get to long and tickel my wifes nose</li>
    <li> Very nice! I really like having the option of the large trimming side and the small side - the guard for even trimming is really handy as well. Easy to store - love that it came with a battery!</li>
    <li> My &amp;#34;One Touch&amp;#34; finally stopped working, so I ordered this one.  After reading the reviews, I got a little worried.  Seems like more men are using the Remington.  The &amp;#34;One Touch&amp;#34; was specifically for women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington worked great; however, it hurt a little while the &amp;#34;One Touch&amp;#34; never irritated my skin.  I hope women can use the Remington on their fuzzy facial hair, or I&#x27;m in big trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used it on my fuzzy facial hair on my sideburn area and also along my hairline by my temples.  Maybe, I&#x27;ll revisit this post and update if my facial hair comes in darker.  Gosh, I hope not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just wondering why men are using this on their face.  They sell trimmers specifically for nose and ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, as the title states, &amp;#34;So far, So Good.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Just wanted to warn you all, DO NOT buy a Remington nose hair trimmer. You will be sorry.&lt;br /&gt;I have gone through 2 of them already with very light usage, a black one and a silver one similar to this one.&lt;br /&gt;Each one cost about $20 at the pharmacy. They are very cheaply made and only last a short time,&lt;br /&gt;before #1 just stopped working and #2: cheap plastic switch broke off (it will not reattach back on to the unit)&lt;br /&gt;and will not work without the switch attached. Only 1 year warranty &amp; they break shortly after.&lt;br /&gt;I only used them once or twice a month, handled them very gently, never dropped them.</li>
    <li> Pros: Excellent blade and build quality  cons: no cleaning brush and the mini comb has to be carried separately unlike the Conair LT3WB.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, crazy brows run in his family. This is a must have for eyebrows, made a big difference!</li>
    <li> It does the job, but is very loud &amp; a bit rough. There were no replacement blades. Next time I will go back to Avon&#x27;s, which is quiet &amp; gentle.</li>
    <li> I want to give a star review I just dont want to write alot  if I give it a 5 star review that means I love it and would recommend it. thank you</li>
    <li> This is a nice little machine. I use it to thin out and shape my hair-do, rather than just trim my facial hair. Even though it&#x27;s not too powerful, with patience, it does the job. The \\&quot;attachment\\&quot; to determine the length of hair removed, doesn&#x27;t attach too well. Once again, patience will carry the day. This little thing does exactly what I want it to do.</li>
    <li> But, for the money, this deserves its praise. As other reviewers have stated, it does do what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I used to have another one of these, it was a panasonic I think that I received free with a purchase of an electric shaver. It lived for years, but unfortunately I dropped it and it shattered to pieces. That little thing had so much power to it, this one lacks &#x27;power&#x27;. I should try replacing the battery it came with, maybe it will work better.  My other one had more power as well as shaved more cleanly and quickly.   I purchased this one due to it being cheaper than the rest since I simply wanted it to clean my eyebrows, but I may soon purchase the Panasonic pink one in the related category up there.  All in all, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, I simply liked my other one better.</li>
    <li> stopped working after 2 months, its a one time use!!!! It doesn&#x27;t matter how good you take care of it. it will stop working. Dont buy.</li>
    <li> This little trimmer works very well. I have tried several different trimmers and this is the best i have found.</li>
    <li> Normally these devices seem to wear out quickly and just get replaced.  This seems to be built a lot better and I have changed batteries a few times but still shaves nice and sharp.  No problems with attachments, everything works nicely.  Good value.</li>
    <li> It seems like I have to replace the battery for this frequently even when I only use it for 10 minutes every few weeks. It&#x27;s been 3 years since I&#x27;ve had this and it still works though!</li>
    <li> Poor poor quality. Buy the Whal version.</li>
    <li> Decent product, and I know it says item may differ than what is  ordered but they gave me a purple girly trimmer. Really? 3 stars for that, 4 star product.</li>
    <li> I love this!!! It works like a charm. I have used this for a while and had no problems. I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from a drug store that was part of a large chain (CVS Pharmacy), and so initially I had confidence that the device would work.  What is surprising, is that the device is very small, about the size of tire pressure gauge.  However, despite the small size of the instrument, and tiny size of the cutting edge, I still had some confidence that it would really work.  The device has a couple of features that look like buttons or sliding clamps, but the purpose of these features is not immediately clear. Unless the customer possesses a microscope and is able to read the instructions (all in fine print), and unless the user carries the instructions with him, it is not immediately apparent which buttons to push to turn the device on, or to open up the battery compartment. At any rate, within a few minutes, I was able to get the machine up-and-running.  The device was not particularly effective with ear hairs.  Ear hairs come with the territory of being a male over the age of 40.  And so, I am back to using a sharp edged hand razor for this kind of trim.  Over the course of a couple of weeks, I continued to try using this product.  What happened was that the business-end of the device, that is, part of the metal vibrating component, fell off and could not be restored to its original position.  And so, my conclusion is that this device falls into the category known as, \\&quot;junque.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Worked one time and gave up the ghost.</li>
    <li> I got a purple version so firstly it was not as pictured colorwise. Secondly it doesn&#x27;t cut it puls and rips. I would not recommend this to anyone for purchase as I&#x27;m greatly disappointed in it&#x27;s operation.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully. small enough to carry on trips and powerful</li>
    <li> Broke very quickly.  Didn&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this unit, as other similar units (other brands) I have purchased were poor.  But this unit works a little better than some I have had.  It is weak and probably won&#x27;t last much longer (a year so far, used about 1x month).  I wish someone would make a quality, dependable trimmer - even if it costs a little more.</li>
    <li> This works very well.  Very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> OK,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t write these But saw too many people having trouble with this trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a GOOD $7.99 Trimmer!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone complaining about the quality is just not treating it right&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read complaints here about two things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It uses a BATTERY (not very strong), SO if it stops working I rinse my clipping head under a little water to CLEAN it (or put 1 drop of Olive Oil on the blades)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then it works FINE again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The trimmer guard (for doing eyebrows) has to be put on carefully (don&#x27;t just try and jam it on)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington Mpt3500 Dual Blade Facial Trimmer works WAY BETTER than my last \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO: 154 people saying the \\&quot;Pink\\&quot; Panasonic ES2113PC Pivoting Head Facial Trimmer works good, I DON&#x27;T LIKE IT (made for girls) Guys don&#x27;t want a MOVING HEAD)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it to my daughter...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a commonsense person you will have no trouble with this, I am ordering one for my son now&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe</li>
    <li> I bought this one because reviews were claiming it was built sturdier than other trimmers (that stopped working or fell apart). It fell apart within 2 weeks and vital parts went down my sink drain. I was able to hold it together with rubber bands but then it stopped working altogether and I threw it in the garbage. Even when it worked, it scraped and pinched the skin, very uncomfortable to use. Next?</li>
    <li> Have owned several of these, because there do not seem to be any good alternatives. I&#x27;ve replaced this at least 3 times already. If I could pay double the price for a product that lasted at least 2 years, I&#x27;d gladly pay it compared to constantly trying to get this thing to turn on.</li>
    <li> I had a similar poor experience with this shaver. It works fine when it works, but just try getting it to consistently work. Off and on, shake it to make better contact, remove and re-install a fresher battery; it&#x27;s all the same that after the first few uses, you never know if you&#x27;ll be trimming anything.</li>
    <li> Sure it&#x27;s a little underpowered and sometimes I have to bump it to get it started but it is still better than all the other ones that I&#x27;ve tried and everyone who knows me and doesn&#x27;t want to see my unsightly facial hairs is thankful for this little trimmer too. Seriously though I bought another brand of a different style that is more heavy duty and even though it doesn&#x27;t stall it usually falls apart every time I pick it up so I&#x27;m staying with this one until something better comes along.</li>
    <li> It works well for getting to nose or ear hairs (it sucks getting old) but for some reason it gets uncomfortably warm after a minute or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weird issue but it was good for the price</li>
    <li> This trimmer simply doesn&#x27;t work on me.  It isn&#x27;t worth even the small amount I paid for it.  Unfortunately, it is one of those things that I will always be searching for an answer to my problem.</li>
    <li> I got this from CVS to replace a trimmer I accidentally knocked into the toilet. That trimmer was one I had seen on TV (also bought from CVS) but I can&#x27;t remember the brand. I chose this trimmer because of the length-guide part. My previous trimmer had a rectangular guide which did nothing to lift hair that was lying down; this trimmer&#x27;s guide is sloped to raise hairs up to be cut. It works very well, although the &#x27;short&#x27; side is a little too short for my taste. It&#x27;s not much longer than using without the guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downsides? Really, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is sometimes there&#x27;s a little bit of irritation if I go too quickly. I&#x27;ve also been scratched and plucked many many more times than with my previous trimmer. Nonetheless, I still use this thing every week or two for tidying myself up. It gets the job done and hasn&#x27;t died after one years use. For the price, I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done...that&#x27;s the good part. It&#x27;s very noisy and not at all &#x27;smooth&#x27;. Guess I was spoiled by my very old Avon one that worked incredibly well. This one is pretty awful!</li>
    <li> Worked fine for the first month I had it. Now the blade is jagged and hurts! Would not recommend unless you want something disposable.</li>
    <li> This is one of those items that delivers everything it promises.  Good value and price.  A great gift that actually works and is high quality that will last for years to come. Easy to use and very functionable.</li>
    <li> I have owned this for awhile and it is still working great. This is better than the one we replaced. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Works OK. Not very durable feeling and tends to get stuck between uses but it continues to work after months of occasional use</li>
    <li> Initially I loved this but after a few uses it didn&#x27;t work consistently and I noticed it was starting to nick my face, I think something broke on the razor part and now hurts to use. Purchasing another brand next time</li>
    <li> This is so underpowered that it has a hard time even starting against its own friction.  Frequently stalls when it hits a hair (which then yanks it out rather than cutting).  Get the new Remington NE-3250 for about the same price.</li>
    <li> This great little trimmer is good for traveling, etc.  They do not last a terribly long time but for the price it&#x27;s a handy little product.</li>
    <li> I would rate this less then one star if I could.  I just bought this product today.  Trimming ear and nose hairs is fair at best.  After a test run that didn&#x27;t impress me very much, I attempted to clean out the blade by opening the top part of the trimmer.  The head opened up easy enough,  but when I tried to put it back together the tiny little plastic switch that was supposed to lock everything back in place wouldn&#x27;t latch.  Then I took it apart again to see if the little switch was perhaps stuck, I barely touched it and it flew off the instrument probably never to be seen again.  The switch is so tiny that it could very well be stuck between the fibers of my sofa.&lt;br /&gt;I sure miss the pre-China syndrome where things were made with quality materials and the companies that sold products actually seemed to care about quality and not just selling as many cheaply made throw away junk like they do now.</li>
    <li> I had a trimmer for many years to trim the back of my neck.  It got to the point where is wouldn&#x27;t cut.  So I replace it with the Remington Mpt3500.  It works very well and is much sharper than the old one. I think it might be better than the old one when it was new. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> We owned a similar product for several years that we had bought at Bed, Bath and Beyond and it had finally broken down.  We found this one on Amazon, figuring the good reviews meant it would be a good replacement for our old one.  However, being able to compare the two (wish I remembered what brand our other was!!), this one is scratchy and has a rough edge, which our other did not.  Also, this one lasted a little over 5 months before it literally just fell apart in pieces.  Very disappointed and will be searching out another brand!</li>
    <li> REMINGTON,FACIAL TRIMMER.WORKS WELL MY MOUSTACHE IS THICK.TO BAD THE MOTOR COULD&lt;br /&gt;BE A LITTLE STRONGER.BUT I&#x27;M STILL HAPPY WHIT IT</li>
    <li> This little guy is great- trims facial and nose hair easily. It even comes with the battery. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The blades don&#x27;t slide fast enough, and thus it more PULLS the hair and then catches and freezes up, until I turn it off and on and off and on. I&#x27;ve had MUCH better luck with the [[ASIN:B0006UTYTC Conair LT3WB Dual Blade Fine Line Trimmer]] that costs about $6 on amazon.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and used it only one time.  The next time I went to use it, it doesn&#x27;t even turn on.  This isn&#x27;t a product I use every week so by the time I went to use it the second time and it didn&#x27;t turn on, I&#x27;m no longer within the timeframe to be able to return it.  I&#x27;ve changed the batteries even though those shouldn&#x27;t have been deal already, and it just simply doesn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;I used it as a nose hair trimmer and wasn&#x27;t a fan of the blades on both sides as it wasn&#x27;t as comfortable inside but still did the job.  I would have kept it and continued to use it but since it no longer turn on I will now need to purchase something else.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I barely used this thing and it stopped working.</li>
    <li> Really poorly constructed and stopped working after the second use. It was a gift so I&#x27;m forced to replace it since my wife keeps complaining about my nose hairs.</li>
    <li> Works well. I have pale skin and a lot of of dark facial hair so it&#x27;s very noticeable. I use this for my jaw, cheeks, chin and mustache and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. Not nearly as irritating afterwards as wax, bleach (ugh), or a regular razor.</li>
    <li> What a waste of money!  Used it, works but not as good as other (razor).  You also need to find a place to hold the little pieces and remember where you placed them....lol</li>
    <li> I have purchased this model and its predecessor.  The earlier model failed about a few months, refusing to turn on.  I checked the battery connections and even tried to run it off a separate 1.5 volt power source where I could see that it was drawing power - but no dice.  I noticed that this new model was advertised having more power, so, as the original worked so well when it worked, I made a purchase.  Again, after a month it too failed.  I made the same checks without success and returned it for a replacement under the warranty.  So far, so good.  But it is important to store the unit vertically with the trimmer blades facing down so that any residual water from rinsing the trimmer head after use drains out and not into the motor, contaminating the mechanism and rendering it useless.  To make sure this condition was obtained, I attached a thin rubber self adhesive strip magnet to on side of the removable trimmer head cover and placed the trimmer with the cover attached against a wall in my steel medicine cabinet with the cover facing down.  Having tried a number of trimmers, I have found this one to be excellent for all its intended purposes, but the instructions need to include storage advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After almost two years this warranty replaced trimmer refused to start, but it did run when connected to the voltage produced by two, instead of just one, AAA battery.  So, in the unlikely event anyone else persists in restoring function when confronted with this situation, mine ended up as a souped-up trimmer running off an orphaned AC adapter.</li>
    <li> I had one of these facial trimmers and ruined it by allowing the battery to corrode. I was really upset until I found another one online and ordered it from amazon. I received the order within three days, the trimmer was exactly what I wanted, and the price was extremely reasonable. I&#x27;d order from these folks again.</li>
    <li> Good product. Does what it is supposed to do very well. Couldn&#x27;t ask for much more. Happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Started to have problems with it eating batteries and not turning on consistently after a month or so.  Completely failed after 5 months.  Waste of money</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was cheap and that was the worst decision in buying this product. It kept getting caught and couldn&#x27;t really do an effective job of cutting hair on the neck or back of the head. I&#x27;d say go for something like a Wahl that is made of more durable materials and actually has a good motor.</li>
    <li> When it works, it works decently. The trimmer stopped working after 5 months even though I&#x27;ve only used it occasionally. I&#x27;ve owned 2 of these in the last year. When I contacted Remington&#x27;s customer service, I was told to ship the defective product back to them at my own cost, even though the product is covered under warranty for 2 years. I would have given this product 2 stars, but the lack of customer service has convinced me I&#x27;ll no longer buy Remington products. This product works, it&#x27;s just flimsy and isn&#x27;t built to last.</li>
    <li> This is a simple trimmer with a two sided trimmer blade and when it works it does the job well. I prefer this oscillating cutter over the rotary I used to have. The problem is that it is of such low quality that it randomly does not work and requires tapping or removal and reinsertion of the battery in order to get it to function.&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for I guess - it&#x27;s available for less in high street pharmacies - but to be honest I expected better from a \\&quot;name\\&quot; like Remington.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  It does exactly what you want it do and then some.  I am sooo happy I bought this one and would highly recommend it and it even comes with the battery which is a nice touch!!!</li>
    <li> Stopped working after jus a few uses.</li>
    <li> The item shipped to me was not the same as the item advertised...we had to return it for a credit.</li>
    <li> Had bought this product in 2011 and it JUST now died on me. I can only say wonderful things about this product and just ordered another one to replace the one I had for so many years I use it to shave down my mustach and arm hair. (Im Italian im hairy) LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Great little shaver with lots of power. Very sturdy and leaves a clean shave. Light weight and easy to use.</li>
    <li> It cuts a lot. If you want something that will take off all your hair it&#x27;s great. The tool to trim hair wasn&#x27;t that good either, the long side still made my hair short, it almost took off all my eyebrows... Lol Also it got wet inside and broke.</li>
    <li> Good item. Pleased with it. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have bought other versions of same brand before.  All suffer from sometimes not starting, new battery or not.  However, if you tap it on side of sink, it seems to turn on.</li>
    <li> Every time I use this trimmer, I come away with the skin inside my nostrils tender and red. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s common with trimmers like this, because my father taught me to trim my nose hairs with scissors. So I guess using this device is a trade-off: it&#x27;s way faster than scissors, but I never used to finish trimming my nose hairs feeling like I had a cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device&#x27;s simple, adjustable head fits in most of a man&#x27;s hairy orifices smoothly, allowing the user to turn and position it with minimal facial contortions. Most hair vanishes on the first pass, though a few facial contours will require two or three swipes. I like this ergonomic ease of use; weeding my nose hair garden, formerly one of my most tedious grooming tasks, is now simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade guard, which appears to be made of the same metal as the blade, vibrates somewhat when I use it, which I think causes my skin irritation. And not just on tender nostril tissue either, as I use it to edge my moustache. When I finish regular trimming sore and tender in my nose, ears, and upper lip (I have cut myself with this), I consider that a drawback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On balance, this is a good trimmer for its price. It definitely beats scissors, especially since the hair stays gone for nearly a week, not three or four days. It has good battery life, and I still have the manufacturer&#x27;s battery. But be aware that some of your tenderest facial skin will sting for a bit after you use it. You decide if the rewards justify the cost.</li>
    <li> I buy a lot of Remington products and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet. This blade is tiny but can handle a big job. I use it for my womanhood and it does its job.</li>
    <li> This is the fourth one I have bought and they all stop working within six months.  This one only lasted one use.  It would turn on and sound like it was working, but the blade was moving and therefore not cutting anything.  I also ordered the Panasonic pivoting shaver to compare this time and it works really well.  I can&#x27;t believe I have wasted my money on this poor made product four times before I decided to try another brand.</li>
    <li> This may be a case of you get what you pay for..It does not have a lot of power and the power it does have seems inconsistent. Had this for about 6mo and it seems to be on the decline after very little use..No it is not a battery issue. I have to slap it around a bit to get it going. I even oil the blades ect..So its not that either. The oil helped a bit but bottom line is this thing is cheap. I was going to trim my brows and this thing stalled out or froze soon as I hit my brows with the attachment on it. I mean I know I have man hair that is thick and what not but is this thing for a man or a little girl?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I can get use out of it and have..But outside of the first couple times I used it, this thing has been on the decline. And there is no room for decline with this product. Some times it doesn&#x27;t even turn on. Again, I need to slap it around a bit first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to look for something similiar that is higher quality. I rather pay more for a product that gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Perfect little compact face trimmer! Does the job for those difficult areas and keeps your beauty game on!</li>
    <li> Nice for those constant wild hairs on your face and it doesn&#x60;t cost $200. I have used these forever and love them.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality trimmer, at a reasonable price. Great for nose, eyebrows, ears and sideburns, and any thing else that requires trimming. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> They say it&#x27;s unisex, but mine was definitely decorated for women. It&#x27;s the same product, but I&#x27;d kinda rather have the silver one than the purple with flourishes one they sent. It wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle of returning it. It works. Whatever.</li>
    <li> When it works, it does the job, but quality of this product is very bad. I have had it for an year. Never know when it works. Usually end up knocking it on my counter top a few times for it to start working. The parts are very loosely connected and fall apart from time to time. The blades wore out quickly as well. Wouldnt recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The only kind my daughter will use for those &amp;#34;smaller&amp;#34; areas.</li>
    <li> This trimmer does a good job, when it works. It has now become a ritual to twist, tap, torque, and dismantle it every time I want it to run. Even then it has very little power. And the second blade is good for only one thing - biting you where you least expect it.</li>
    <li> Not a great trimmer. I have bought this type of $9.99 trimmer many times, but somehow this brand doesn&#x27;t make a great quality trimmer. Don&#x27;t buy this trimmer from Remington!</li>
</ol>
