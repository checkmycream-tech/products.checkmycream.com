      <li>Nice alternative for the summer as opposed to wearing a nude nail color</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice color and nail polish, it just lacked the mirror like quality I was looking for</li>
      <li>I love the Good as Gold though</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice color, but its not chrome.</li>
      <li>It goes on nice, but it does not have a chrome effect at all.  </li>
      <li>This is, by far, the best silver polish I own.</li>
      <li>When it runs out, I will order some more for sure!</li>
      <li>Also, I love silver, so this couldn&#x27;t be better!</li>
      <li>This product is very easy to use, doesn&#x27;t clump up and glides very smoothly.</li>
      <li>The package came to me so quickly, and I didn&#x27;t have to pay shipping!!</li>
      <li>Very smooth look.</li>
      <li>This is a beautiful silver color that looks good as a design or on the entire nail.</li>
      <li>While I was applying the top coat, the chrome color smeared and became translucent.</li>
      <li>I love this nail polish.</li>
      <li>but it was a much more mirror-like shine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Shipping: Great and fast.</li>
      <li>it looks even better when you add a sparkle nail polish over it.</li>
      <li>I love that it makes a statement, but matches everything you have on.</li>
      <li>I have received so many compliments.</li>
      <li>Nice smooth coverage and have not had any problems....</li>
      <li>but the it fads after a day without top coat</li>
      <li>My favorite.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t shine like chrome, but rather a bit murky, but I can&#x27;t find anything else that is more convenient.</li>
      <li>It is nothing more than a silver &amp;#34;chrome&amp;#34;-like</li>
      <li>This was the closest to my favorite Sally Hansen &amp;#34;Chrome&amp;#34; which was discontinued years ago.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>It came on time and even came with a free bag !</li>
      <li>I still am glad I bought this product.</li>
      <li>I am in love with it.</li>
      <li>love the color.</li>
      <li>I have seen some incredibly reflective swatches of it, but I have found it to be only somewhat reflective.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily, dries quickly, and gives me an almost mirror like finish!</li>
      <li>it is quick drying!</li>
      <li>I was filled by the word &amp;#34;mirror&amp;#34; chrome.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love silver polish and tried many of them, this one is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>I have always had issues with frost colors on my nails, because I have light brown skin.</li>
      <li>This looked great on the tips of my red nails for Christmas!</li>
      <li>, it went on smooth and lasted for weeks on my toes.</li>
      <li>very fun and festive for the holidays.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s very nice overall.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to be able to get Essie polish - especially the chrome - for a reasonable price.!</li>
      <li>I really like the shade of silver, because it is a cool color, but it is warm in</li>
      <li>I was really excited to try this color out because I saw someone wear it and it looked like it came off a truck&#x27;s grill, but trying it out for myself however</li>
      <li>I originally saw this product on Pinterest and the nails that were painted in the pin looked like they had a reflective silver finish.</li>
      <li>However, this is the first bright/warm shade I have been able to pull off.</li>
      <li>Good enough for me!</li>
      <li>I love this chrome color so much.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not bad, not bad at all.</li>
      <li>First off I just want to say, THIS IS MY NEW FAVORITE COLOR!</li>
      <li>it came quickly..</li>
      <li>It also chipped quickly.  </li>
      <li>Super streaky, and the bottle I received looked like it had been used before</li>
      <li>It dries so quickly when I apply in on my nails and the chrome you get isn&#x27;t exactly like a smooth mirror finish but rather like liquid silver on the nails, not like those stick-on mirror nails.</li>
      <li>It is a very pretty silver , but is not a mirror finish.</li>
      <li>On their own, they are not crisp chrome-like finishes but are more like a buffed metallic.</li>
      <li>I saw the picture, so it had to be true, right?</li>
      <li>I rarely use Essie polishes but read the reviews and decided to try it.  </li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t go on right from the beginning, it was streaky and didn&#x27;t cover well.  </li>
      <li>I love Essie, but you&#x27;d think that for $8 a bottle they&#x27;d work out the formula a little better.</li>
      <li>I let my nails dry a FULL DAY before applying essie&#x27;s top coat.</li>
      <li>Well, this is my first Essie nail polish.</li>
      <li>but i thought this was more chrome looking than it actually is.&lt;br /&gt;Check out</li>
      <li>It was not as chrome as I was looking for very foggy did not shine like I had hoped it would!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a pretty color</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.</li>
      <li>It is exactly what is pictured.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s great to be able to get Essie polish - especially the chrome - for a reasonable price.!</li>
    <li> It was not as chrome as I was looking for very foggy did not shine like I had hoped it would!</li>
    <li> As beautiful as this looks, it&#x27;s sort of a pain to put on. Mainly because it starts to set within literally seconds of being brushed on, so you have to work fast with each nail or you&#x27;ll start dragging and wrinkling globs of polish around. If you go fast and light, a single coat should be enough in most cases, and it rarely seems to streak.</li>
    <li> love the color. it came quickly.. but the it fads after a day without top coat</li>
    <li> This was the closest to my favorite Sally Hansen &amp;#34;Chrome&amp;#34; which was discontinued years ago. Happy to find this :-)</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter and she loves it, and had the perfect super shiney look she wanted!  Very smooth look. Good quality.</li>
    <li> This is a great color. very fun and festive for the holidays. Essie nail polish is great and one of my favorite brands.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t go on right from the beginning, it was streaky and didn&#x27;t cover well.  It also chipped quickly.  I love the Good as Gold though, it went on smooth and lasted for weeks on my toes.</li>
    <li> I had seen an ad for this product in a magazine and it looked like the chrome on my sink faucet - very shiny - so that&#x27;s what I expected however although I like it it is far from the shiny look I expected.</li>
    <li> I am happy that I found this chrome polish, after using Sally Hansen for years.  No complaints and it is quick drying!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t look metallic. We expected a glossier finish.</li>
    <li> This color is so great! I love that it makes a statement, but matches everything you have on. Also, I love silver, so this couldn&#x27;t be better! The package came to me so quickly, and I didn&#x27;t have to pay shipping!!</li>
    <li> All of Essie nail products are high quality. This color turns out just like the name &amp;#34;No Place Like Chrome&amp;#34;, it has a great metallic shine. This product is very easy to use, doesn&#x27;t clump up and glides very smoothly. The price is great too!</li>
    <li> This polish is very shiny, but is not mirror like. I was searching for a good chrome or mirror like polish and this one kept coming up in searches on Pinterest. I saw some video reviews on YouTube about it decided to try. It is a very pretty silver , but is not a mirror finish. I will use it, it just is not as shiny as I was going for.</li>
    <li> I bought Good as Gold and No Place like Chrome for nail stamping, and they did not disappoint. On their own, they are not crisp chrome-like finishes but are more like a buffed metallic. As stamping polishes, they are opaque and versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This type of finish when used as regular nail polish can highlight imperfections on the nail like ridges; I would recommend a thick, self-leveling base coat with this product like Nail Tek&#x27;s Ridge Filler.</li>
    <li> Best nail polish I have ever purchased. Will definitely buy again  no problem with shipment. One coat of polish is like two of other brands I have.love how shiny it is. My favorite. Was having a problem finding chrome like I like. This one is definitely a keeper</li>
    <li> Perfect! I was skeptical at first that this would be the right color because I ordered another Essie nail polish from a different seller and it wasn&#x27;t even close to the right color and it was very watery. But this one is perfect. It&#x27;s the same color as pictured, it&#x27;s not watery, and the shipping was fast. I painted my nails this color the day the nail polish came in the mail.</li>
    <li> The product states it gives a mirror effect. It does nothing of the sort. It just a normal silver nail polish.</li>
    <li> I ordered this with one of my husband&#x27;s orders. Really smooth polish and long wearing.  I paint my toes with this and it looks sexy and classy at the same time.  I have recommended this to friends of mine a few times.  When it runs out, I will order some more for sure!</li>
    <li> I was wanting mirror polish this is just silver polish. I would not recommend to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a pretty color</li>
    <li> Works great with Konad/ nail stamping. This is a beautiful silver color that looks good as a design or on the entire nail. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I could get the same stuff at Wal-Mart for cheap. I was filled by the word &amp;#34;mirror&amp;#34; chrome. Wasn&#x27;t happy....</li>
    <li> Poor Quality. Bottle and cap look different from Essie products, and chipped next day, which is unusual. May just be my experience.</li>
    <li> I love it. It dries so quickly when I apply in on my nails and the chrome you get isn&#x27;t exactly like a smooth mirror finish but rather like liquid silver on the nails, not like those stick-on mirror nails. But they look amazing anyway!</li>
    <li> super streaky, v disappointed</li>
    <li> Looks just like picture. Went on great.</li>
    <li> ...but I expected this color to be more chrome-y and mirror-like rather than just silver. Am i doing something wrong?</li>
    <li> Get Zoya&#x27;s &amp;#34;Trixie,&amp;#34; instead.  This one is streaky, gloopy and shows any and every flaw your nail has -- even ones you didn&#x27;t know you had.  A hot mess, IMO.</li>
    <li> The color is a little different than what I was expecting but it&#x27;s not bad, not bad at all. The metallics don&#x27;t stay on so well but if you swab your nails with a little witch hazel you an get a little longer wear from polish. (4days)</li>
    <li> Super streaky, and the bottle I received looked like it had been used before/was really old. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> I have shiny little disco balls on my toes. Essie never disappoints with their texture and color quality&lt;br /&gt;Great summer toe nail polish</li>
    <li> Great nail polish for the holidays</li>
    <li> I really like the shade of silver, because it is a cool color, but it is warm in it&#x27;s hue. I have always had issues with frost colors on my nails, because I have light brown skin. However, this is the first bright/warm shade I have been able to pull off. This is not the metal finish look; but a look of refined bright silver, and it is gorgeous!</li>
    <li> This looked great on the tips of my red nails for Christmas! I received lots of compliments ! Great color!</li>
    <li> I rarely use Essie polishes but read the reviews and decided to try it.  If your careful when you paint your nails you can hardly see the brush strokes. Very nice metallic shine and color.</li>
    <li> The seller got this to me ASAP. The polish is a tad on the thick/unmanageable end, but the color is just wonderful. I have seen some incredibly reflective swatches of it, but I have found it to be only somewhat reflective.</li>
    <li> This is amazing when the sun hits it. Long lasting and strong. Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> As far as metallics go in nail polish it&#x27;s really hard to find good ones... this product is as shiny as it could get in liquid form without using press ons.  Good enough for me!</li>
    <li> This is, by far, the best silver polish I own. I absolutely love silver polish and tried many of them, this one is by far my favorite. It goes on easily, dries quickly, and gives me an almost mirror like finish!</li>
    <li> Bought for bridesmaids outfit.  I really like this brand of nailpolish, but hate the color.  It lasted a long time... too long, haha.  It is pure metallic silver - like the shiny side of tin foil.</li>
    <li> I originally saw this product on Pinterest and the nails that were painted in the pin looked like they had a reflective silver finish. I saw the picture, so it had to be true, right? I don&#x27;t know what the woman had on her fingers, but it was not this product. I was very disappointed to discover this is just any ol&#x27; silver nail polish. There&#x27;s nothing mirror-like or chrome about it. And it was expensive off Amazon; not sure what it sells for elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this color out because I saw someone wear it and it looked like it came off a truck&#x27;s grill, but trying it out for myself however, it looked like I took a Metallic Sharpie and colored it in silver. Its a cute color but not exactly what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Not what it says at all! It is nothing more than a silver &amp;#34;chrome&amp;#34;-like (I guess) color!</li>
    <li> Good news: The color is very opaque, you don&#x27;t even need to apply a second coat! Bad news: I let my nails dry a FULL DAY before applying essie&#x27;s top coat. While I was applying the top coat, the chrome color smeared and became translucent. You could see my nail underneath. Shame, great color, but I can&#x27;t even apply a top coat without the color smearing.</li>
    <li> I saw a picture that said it was this color but it was a much more mirror-like shine. This is just silver. It&#x27;s a nice color, but its not chrome.</li>
    <li> The nail color did not come out the way I was hoping it would. It does not give a mirror like finish, but is just another silver nail polish, boring</li>
    <li> Color: First off I just want to say, THIS IS MY NEW FAVORITE COLOR! I am in love with it. It is exactly what is pictured. It has a great silvery shimmer and shine. I have received so many compliments. Essie is quality nail polish always; it lasts for so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping: Great and fast. Received the item just as I was expecting it.</li>
    <li> It goes on nice, but it does not have a chrome effect at all.  It looks like a got a silver sharpie and painted my nails.  It&#x27;s just too matte.</li>
    <li> I love this chrome color so much.  it looks even better when you add a sparkle nail polish over it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice polish. It is metallic silver not a mirror effect.</li>
    <li> Love Essie nail polishes and this one is no different.  Nice smooth coverage and have not had any problems....yet.</li>
    <li> Nice alternative for the summer as opposed to wearing a nude nail color</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish. It came on time and even came with a free bag ! And the color is so awesome ! It really looks like chrome ! Wish I could order more !!!!!!</li>
    <li> This, like many Essie polishes, goes on very streaky and it&#x27;s hard not to have visible brushstrokes. I love Essie, but you&#x27;d think that for $8 a bottle they&#x27;d work out the formula a little better.</li>
    <li> I use this to cover up scratches on the metal parts of my motorcycle. It doesn&#x27;t shine like chrome, but rather a bit murky, but I can&#x27;t find anything else that is more convenient.</li>
    <li> Well, this is my first Essie nail polish. It is a gorgeous color, but its pretty streaky and was hard to apply with out it clumping. I still am glad I bought this product. I painted my toenails and had a very hard time applying it to my big toes. I had to redo it twice. I still think it is gorgeous. I don&#x27;t know about the other Essie nail polishes, but his bottle seemed a bit small. It is .46 oz. Normal? I don&#x27;t know. I still do not regret buying No Place Like Chrome.</li>
    <li> Solid job from Essie. I had been trying to find a bettery quality replacement for Sally Hansen&#x27;s silver chrome line from a few years ago (it is no longer sold), and I found a more than suitable replacement from the professional quality that only Essie offers. I love chrome polishes, and have experience buyer&#x27;s remorse with several other attempts at it from other brands, wherein the supposedly chrome color just ends up being a very lighty silvery gray color, but is not TRUE chrome (reflects light back, like a mirror). If this is what you&#x27;re looking for, but this now.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color and looks dazzling on but does streak. I dont mind it because it adds a bit of texture to the nail look. I would purchase this again!</li>
    <li> Essie has great polish but i thought this was more chrome looking than it actually is.&lt;br /&gt;Check out my nail art slide show&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice color and nail polish, it just lacked the mirror like quality I was looking for but it&#x27;s very nice overall.</li>
</ol>
