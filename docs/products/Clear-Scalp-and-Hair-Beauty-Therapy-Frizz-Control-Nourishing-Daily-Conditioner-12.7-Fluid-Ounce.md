### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>but all in all this conditioner is awesome.</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>I recommend using the shampoo and conditioner together along with a leave in conditioner to get the best results.</li>
      <li>plus it doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest either.</li>
      <li>Well after drying and styling my hair it looked great!</li>
      <li>The floral scent is not empowering and very pleasant.</li>
      <li>conditioner along with the hair therapy is very nice and does not make your hair feel greasy and the smell is very pleasant.</li>
      <li>While my hair may not get fizzy it does have lots of \\&quot;fly away\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>Great price, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>My hair has a nice slip to it and falls beautifully.</li>
      <li>A good comparison is softener for clothes put in during the rinse cycle.</li>
      <li>/&gt;First, the good: this conditioner didn&#x27;t do any harm.</li>
      <li>If you have my problem too, this is a good choice as well.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel coated, just silky and good.</li>
      <li>I started using this product about 8 months ago and have been very pleased.</li>
      <li>This shampoo and conditioner does a good job, in her words \\&quot;it smells nice, and leaves my hair normal\\&quot;</li>
      <li>The thickness of the product is great and it spreads easily through the hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really nice smell</li>
      <li>and it is nice that the conditioner stays at the bottom, so</li>
      <li>Conditions Nicely</li>
      <li>This is a nice hair conditioner.</li>
      <li>This product would probably be better suited to a person with thicker, coarser hair than my own.</li>
      <li>Clear, in this regard is a wonderful example of a conservative and fragrant shampoo.</li>
      <li>I would like to try it with the shampoo of its kind to see if it does a better job.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice, clean floral scent that is pleasant and not too strong.</li>
      <li>Love the way the hair feels so smoooth after usage.  </li>
      <li>With summer humidity comes more frizzy hair.  </li>
      <li>I love frizz control.</li>
      <li>there was a noticeable difference in softness and a notable decrease in frizz.</li>
      <li>have referred this product to many people and now my sister and her family and brother and his family are using this.</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner I will never change shampoo or conditioner again.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pleased with this conditioner and will be using it again.</li>
      <li>Using this sophisticated criteria, one brand of the many I have tried stands out, the brand \\&quot;Clear\\&quot;.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I was still pleased with this product and would buy it.</li>
      <li>Not greasy, controls the frizz (not all of it, but handles it more than most), allows combing through hair after application.  </li>
      <li>Mostly I have not been impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This would probably be great if you like a straight look anyway.  </li>
      <li>The conditioner also has a nice scent that stays with my hair even though it rinses clean.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used all the clear scalp shampoos and conditioners they are all great although I don&#x27;t think this one helps any better than the others with frizz</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an OIL FREE addict, myself -- this stuff is going to be appropriate and doubtless useful.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>The conditioner washed out easily when showering and was easy to use.  </li>
      <li>pro was that my hair was easy to comb through after use.</li>
      <li>It spreads easily though my hair.</li>
      <li>A decent product at a fair price.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s wonderful when my hair retains the virtues of it previous washes.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s wonderful when my hair retains the virtues of it previous washes.</li>
      <li>Overall a great product.</li>
      <li>I was speculative when I squeezed the quarter sized portion into my hand, a lilac cream that reminded me of a light lotion in its consistency.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The shampoo and conditioner both have a light fruity scent, almost like apples.  </li>
      <li>My hair lays smooth when in use along with[[ASIN:</li>
      <li>It did such a great job of cleaning that it took away the shine.</li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>scent is light, and clean.  </li>
      <li>So this conditioner is adequate and works just fine without leaving residue, but I&#x27;ll stick with whatever is on sale at the drug store.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was very pleased with a lot of the Clear skin and hair products.  </li>
      <li>I am very pleased with Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Therapy conditioner.</li>
      <li>I used this in conjunction with the frizz control shampoo by the same company, and I liked it for the most part.</li>
      <li>It does rinse clean despite this.</li>
      <li>The scent is great and will not follow you out the door, but it will work and you will get better results using this everyday on your hair.</li>
      <li>When put to action however I was more than satisfied; my hair like sand in an hourglass succumbing to gravity quickly fell and was soon thoroughly coated in the silky patina</li>
      <li>There are several ways in which conditioner can be applied, surprisingly so for the uninitiated.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good conditioner, and one I&#x27;d definitely buy when in the market for a drugstore conditioner, just don&#x27;t expect it to be a frizz-managing miracle-worker, because it is not.  </li>
      <li>and I did that to try and get the full benefits.  </li>
      <li>Overall, good value and works well.</li>
      <li>I was able to see a nice change in my hair after a couple of uses but discovered by trial and error that the frizz control is lacking unless I add a leave in conditioner to my hair before allowing to dry.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m constantly looking for a good, relatively inexpensive conditioner that can make my wavy, frizzy hair nice and smooth without the hassle of a straightening iron every morning.</li>
      <li>All in all, I am quite happy with this conditioner, and will certainly purchase it in the future.</li>
      <li>I used it with a sulfate free shampoo (not the same brand) and the nice smell blended well with the shampoo.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The scent did seem to dissipate quickly.  </li>
      <li>It does make it easier to figure out which is which quickly when you are taking a shower, but that is about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They worked easily into my hair and rinsed out completely, leaving my hair feeling clean and free of residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall I am very pleased with the results of the two products combined and</li>
      <li>They both have the same pleasant (lightly floral) fragrance and are a decent consistency.</li>
      <li>For a better absorption than Pantene with a better frizz control, I realized I had actually used the recommended portion of conditioner for the first time.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>For a better absorption than Pantene with a better frizz control, I realized I had actually used the recommended portion of conditioner for the first time.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>I like that it left it more easy to comb and to style as well.</li>
      <li>To say I am satisfied with Clear would not do justice to the value I have found in it.</li>
      <li>To say I am satisfied with Clear would not do justice to the value I have found in it.</li>
      <li>I think I could have liked it if it actually delivered on the frizz control promise</li>
      <li>for the conditioner itself, it has a light bubblegummy/fruity scent that makes your hair smell nice without overpowering any other fragrances you are wearing.</li>
      <li>The formula is just right.</li>
      <li>: at first I appreciated the design, which opens from the bottom so that conditioner is always available right at the opening.</li>
      <li>conditioner&#x27;s consistency is only slightly different than the shampoo which is kind of interesting.</li>
      <li>I am also very sensitive to scents and this one had a pretty strong smell.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s neither masculine or feminine and isn&#x27;t overly strong to me.  </li>
      <li>Now I have straight hair on the sides and some frizz on the top, so I decided to try Clear Scalp&#x27;s Frizz Control conditioner.  </li>
      <li>My hair has never been frizzy until it started thinning a bit on top - the high humidity where I live</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work magic and completely eliminate frizz on its own, but it does seem to add to the other products that I use to create a better overall result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now with the curly hair I have, a conditioner that is lightly scented is important due to the fact curly hair is most manageable if left with some conditioner lightly frisked while the hair is damp.</li>
      <li>If you use this in conjunction with the Frizz Control Clear Shampoo, you will experience good results for the first several washes if your hair is prone to weather-based frizzing.</li>
      <li>It smells lovely fresh but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger other than your hair just smelling clean.</li>
      <li>I easily combed out my hair when wet too, a bonus since my hair tangles quite easily.</li>
      <li>but Pantene is softer and smoother, the latter enabling better absorption by tangled or in my case kinky hair.</li>
      <li>, the smell is light and compared to the industrialized scent TRESemme&#x27; offers there is no comparison.</li>
      <li>In this way TRESemme&#x27; is the only conditioner that I had ever been satisfied with in this regard, though its smell often dissuaded me from its use.</li>
      <li>After using this conditioner every day, I have found that my hair is soft and frizz free.</li>
      <li>In this way TRESemme&#x27; is the only conditioner that I had ever been satisfied with in this regard, though its smell often dissuaded me from its use.</li>
      <li>the Clear Frizz control is fantastic.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have any overwhelming smells and using it requires some diligence in rinsing but isn&#x27;t a big deal otherwise.</li>

    <li> I have been using [[ASIN:B00AAIOP44 Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Therapy Frizz Control Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]] along with [[ASIN:B00AE078TM Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Therapy Frizz Control Nourishing Daily Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce]] for well over a week now although I could tell a difference after just a couple of uses.  The manufacture recommends using every day for 7 days and I did that to try and get the full benefits.  I was able to see a nice change in my hair after a couple of uses but discovered by trial and error that the frizz control is lacking unless I add a leave in conditioner to my hair before allowing to dry.  I currently use [[ASIN:B00AWLB9G6 Dove Color Care Leave On Conditioner, 4 Ounce]] and have little to no frizz.  If I leave this step out my hair dries and still has frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo and conditioner both have a light fruity scent, almost like apples.  It&#x27;s a really nice smell and I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments on the scent.  I recommend using the shampoo and conditioner together along with a leave in conditioner to get the best results.</li>
    <li> Our daughter was complaining that some of the other shampoos and conditioners were leaving her hair flat.  How a 9-year old gets into thinking that her hair is flat is another story, but there you go.  This shampoo and conditioner does a good job, in her words \\&quot;it smells nice, and leaves my hair normal\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This is a nice hair conditioner. I started using this conditioner about a month ago in conjunction with the [[ASIN:B00AE0790U Clear Deep Nourishing Treatment Mask]] and I have definitely notice a positive difference in my hairs managability and look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is not as dry and lays much, much better. I do have mid-back length hair, but it is naturally curly. I usually have a stray hair look... as if I were in a wind tunnel, even after conditioning, ...and this is helping in managing my hair from looking way out of control. Not to big on hair sprays, gels and mousses for hair management.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner along with the hair therapy is very nice and does not make your hair feel greasy and the smell is very pleasant. My hair feel much softer too. I&#x27;m not a big fan of the bottle design, but I guess it is what sets it apart from other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a perfect solution but it does help. If you have my problem too, this is a good choice as well.</li>
    <li> Conditions Nicely, Helps Defrizz, though not as well as some other products. Decent smell, clean and smooth, soft, works well with heating products also to not completely fry my hair.</li>
    <li> I have relatively dry, frizz-prone hair. I ordered this product along with the coordinating [[ASIN:B00AAIOP44 Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Therapy Frizz Control Nourishing Shampoo]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together I found these products to work well. They both have the same pleasant (lightly floral) fragrance and are a decent consistency. They worked easily into my hair and rinsed out completely, leaving my hair feeling clean and free of residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon blow-drying my hair there was a noticeable difference in softness and a notable decrease in frizz. I wouldn&#x27;t say these products completely eliminate frizz but they definitely help to reduce it. I also noticed my scalp was less dry while using these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pleased with this conditioner and will be using it again. Great product!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Therapy conditioner. During the winter months especially, my hair and scalp can get dry. I&#x27;ll get bits of dandruff around my temples and my hair gets frizzy. This conditioner seems to control those problems quite well. After just a few days of use, my scalp was healthy and I didn&#x27;t have dry skin flaking off. It also controlled the frizz without weighing my hair down. It has a nice, clean floral scent that is pleasant and not too strong. Lastly, I really like the design of the container. It has a bottom opening so conditioner is always ready to squirt out and not get wasted stuck to the sides, and the base is flat, solid and sturdy so the bottle won&#x27;t tip over.</li>
    <li> I have tried several different Clear products and have been impressed with all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin fine hair, sensitive to a lot of products, and don&#x27;t like scented products.  Clear products don&#x27;t irritate my skin, scalp or noose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product conditions well without leaving my hair overly weighted as some conditioners do.  While my hair may not get fizzy it does have lots of \\&quot;fly away\\&quot;.  My hair lays smooth when in use along with[[ASIN:B00AAIOP44 Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Therapy Frizz Control Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
    <li> I am new to the Clear line of products, so wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. After using it for about a week, I must say I am pleasantly surprised by this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all though, I&#x27;ll start with the bottle design. It is designed so that the product dispenses through the bottom spout with a squeeze. I liked this design at first, now at about halfway through the bottle, I find that it is somewhat hard for me to squeeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the conditioner itself, it has a light bubblegummy/fruity scent that makes your hair smell nice without overpowering any other fragrances you are wearing. The thickness of the product is great and it spreads easily through the hair. I have long hair that frizzes easily, especially when not conditioned enough. After using this conditioner every day, I have found that my hair is soft and frizz free. I easily combed out my hair when wet too, a bonus since my hair tangles quite easily. All in all, I am quite happy with this conditioner, and will certainly purchase it in the future.</li>
    <li> This conditioner feels as if it has some sort of an oil in it. It coats your hair and I found myself working really hard to rinse it all out. Even after getting out of the shower I still felt like my hair had a lot of conditioner in it. Well after drying and styling my hair it looked great! Only problem was, It started to look dirty only hours later. I think this shampoo might work for people with thick hair, but my fine hair did not like this at all, it weighed it down, and made it look stringy.</li>
    <li> Tried this conditioner for a couple weeks now.  Conditioner is moisturizing but not as moisturizing as Dove or Pantene conditioners i regularly use. Love the way the hair feels so smoooth after usage.  The floral scent is not empowering and very pleasant.</li>
    <li> My hair has never been frizzy until it started thinning a bit on top - the high humidity where I live doesn&#x27;t help either.  Now I have straight hair on the sides and some frizz on the top, so I decided to try Clear Scalp&#x27;s Frizz Control conditioner.  I have never been a regular user of conditioner, but using this one has changed my mind.  I saw immediate results after one use.  My hair immediately became less tangled and less frizzy, and it feels so soft.  The conditioner washed out easily when showering and was easy to use.  Overall a great product.</li>
    <li> Conditioned Response; Clear&lt;br /&gt; The luster, the strength, and the feel are all qualities that are valued in hair. For most who wish to support these qualities daily conditioning is an necessary routine to ensure their hair stands up (or should I say stays down?) against the trails of the day. Not all conditioners are created equal, but from an individual with big hair, conditioner is a major part of my day. But what things do we look for in a conditioner? Personally, look for three key sets of traits to ensure my both my hair and my heart are satisfied: price and bottle shape, smell and texture, and of course overall feel and longevity of the product. Using this sophisticated criteria, one brand of the many I have tried stands out, the brand \\&quot;Clear\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt; Clear was not a brand I had myself considered while shopping. Coming in a thin slim pink bottle, the only redeeming quality appeared to be its half off sale tag. My usual purchases ranging from TRESemme&#x27;, Pantene, and Suave the chance purchase of this conditioner could only be described by the brands selection name \\&quot;Frizz Control\\&quot;; desperate times called for desperate measures. Its bottle was off-putting and the limited quantity, emphasized by its delicate shape was not consoling considering the six bucks it occasionally runs. Compared to my normal purchases, ranging from two to five dollars with Suave at the lower and TRESemme&#x27; at the upper ends of the spectrum, the discount was one of the only encouraging reasons I found to buy this product. It&#x27;s meager twelve point seven ounces about seventy five percent less than Suave&#x27;s robust twenty eight ounces meant that I would be getting less out of Clear and without the discount for more money. Circumstances what they were however, with no other known brand in sight, and in a rush; I was pleasantly surprised by what was found in Clear.&lt;br /&gt; There are several ways in which conditioner can be applied, surprisingly so for the uninitiated. Among these are the normal, wash and rinse, the occasional hand hair frisk, and the always useful de-tangling uses, but what makes all these manipulations bearable are the conditioner&#x27;s smell and texture. Now with the curly hair I have, a conditioner that is lightly scented is important due to the fact curly hair is most manageable if left with some conditioner lightly frisked while the hair is damp. A good comparison is softener for clothes put in during the rinse cycle. Most conditioners are potent however, with an intense and strong scent, which can often times mean the difference between an initial purchase and repurchase. If I just showered, the last thing I want to smell is like I just had a bucket of perfume or cat urine poured over me, the latter of which has happened before. Clear, in this regard is a wonderful example of a conservative and fragrant shampoo. Its scent reminiscent of a talcum powder mixed with freesia, the smell is light and compared to the industrialized scent TRESemme&#x27; offers there is no comparison. The only olfactory quality that might frustrate Clear buyers from say Suave is its limited scent varieties; having maybe three scents in all compared to the plethora of Suave.&lt;br /&gt; Of course none of this would be possible if the conditioner&#x27;s consistency were not right, and despite what most may think, the thicker the conditioner does not always mean better. TRESemme&#x27; for example is a thick conditioner but Pantene is softer and smoother, the latter enabling better absorption by tangled or in my case kinky hair. A thicker formula means you have to work harder and often end up using more conditioner, which in Clear&#x27;s case is never a problem. A surprisingly thin conditioner I was speculative when I squeezed the quarter sized portion into my hand, a lilac cream that reminded me of a light lotion in its consistency. When put to action however I was more than satisfied; my hair like sand in an hourglass succumbing to gravity quickly fell and was soon thoroughly coated in the silky patina know as Clear. For a better absorption than Pantene with a better frizz control, I realized I had actually used the recommended portion of conditioner for the first time.&lt;br /&gt; The real test occurred on successive washes when I flip-flopped between what was left of my old brands; I remembered walking out of the shower and after my hair dried thinking \\&quot;do I remember my head being this light?\\&quot; Clear making my tumbleweed of a head feel light enough to be a dandelion puff. I was so surprised at the difference that I just poured what remained of my four conditioners in one bottle to use in between purchases of Clear; when you have as much hair as I do you value weight immensely and while the competition had me grounded, Clear gave me wings, I felt so weightless. TRESemme&#x27;, Suave, Pantene and other brands I had sampled seemed to add weight but don&#x27;t mistake that because of the tamed nature of my hair Clear removed volume; my hair had not felt so rich since an olive oil conditioning experience, which I will say merely reverses the cleaning process, to condition then shampoo.&lt;br /&gt; As for longevity, I like to space conditioning out between combing in the shower to reduce the amount of conditioner I use, so it&#x27;s wonderful when my hair retains the virtues of it previous washes. In this way TRESemme&#x27; is the only conditioner that I had ever been satisfied with in this regard, though its smell often dissuaded me from its use. Pantene and Suave on the other hand presented initial gratification but expectations of repeated use which could be irksome when rinsing off from a run outside to find your hair needs another dose of conditioner to remain tame. Yet against the odds; from freak dryer mishaps to hurried date plans where you have five minutes to tame the beast, with clear I find a value I have never seen before. Now I only need condition every other day, and my hair is near as vibrant to the initial cleansing. The smell does nothing to offend either, a very reassuring fact that to this day constitutes the framework of my consumer loyalty.&lt;br /&gt; To say I am satisfied with Clear would not do justice to the value I have found in it. While initially concerned about its size to my conditioning needs I have come to realize the size of the bottle is a reflection of the products guarantee of quality. Where TRESemme&#x27; and the other competitors are concerned the quantity is merely an excuse for lesser quality. When I use Clear conditioner, and recently now the shampoo, I know the significantly smaller use means I get about as much from Clears dinky pink bottles. So while I may not like the extra few bucks that are required in Clears purchase, I am glad to pay it for the reassurance it will always work and work well. Like the bandages kept in the house emergency kit; my hair care kit would be incomplete without my main squeeze, Clear conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Citations&lt;br /&gt;Proctor and Gamble. \\&quot;Pantene Pro-V Aqua Light.\\&quot; Cincinnati, OH. 2015.&lt;br /&gt;Unilever. \\&quot;Clear; scalp and hair beauty therapy, Frizz Control.\\&quot; Trumbull, CT. 2015.&lt;br /&gt;Unilever. \\&quot;Suave, almond + shea butter, conditioner.\\&quot; Trumbull, CT. 2015.&lt;br /&gt;Unilever. \\&quot;TRESemme&#x27;, Naturals.\\&quot; Trumbull, CT. 2015.y patina know as Clear.

    <li> Not greasy, controls the frizz (not all of it, but handles it more than most), allows combing through hair after application.  My wife has a very sensitive scalp, not very many conditioners/shampoos do very well, but this one doesn&#x27;t make it worse, which is a huge compliment to this product.</li>
    <li> I have very frizzy hair that is amplified in the hot summer months.  I hoped that this product would help me tame my hair a bit better, but unfortunately, it really just left it feeling heavy and oily.  I am also very sensitive to scents and this one had a pretty strong smell. The scent did seem to dissipate quickly.  One pro was that my hair was easy to comb through after use.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner I will never change shampoo or conditioner again. I&#x27;ve used all the clear scalp shampoos and conditioners they are all great although I don&#x27;t think this one helps any better than the others with frizz but all in all this conditioner is awesome.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that my frizz is bad and not much controls it. Honestly, I&#x27;m skeptical that any conditioner would help that much more than any other, given that only leave-in products do anything to minimize my frizz. So this conditioner is adequate and works just fine without leaving residue, but I&#x27;ll stick with whatever is on sale at the drug store.</li>
    <li> I nearly used this whole bottle up, and it never really helped with frizz control. The only change I did see with is either this conditioner or its paired shampoo is I starting to give me dry skin. It first started at the top of my forehead right where my hair line starts, then a week later I started getting dry skin at my hair line by my ears. I have never had this problem before with any other shampoo or conditioner. It dries up my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing about this conditioner, is the bottle is a bit smaller than the shampoo bottle. It does make it easier to figure out which is which quickly when you are taking a shower, but that is about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it dries up my scalp, and does do what it claims which is control the frizz...plus it doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest either. Just smells like chemical soap.</li>
    <li> I started using this product about 8 months ago and have been very pleased. I am very sensitive to other shampoos including very high end products. After using CLEAR I shortly noticed a significant improvement in the health of my scalp and hair. My hair is naturally wavy and requires additional products to keep the frizz down. With CLEAR Frizz control I don&#x27;t need to use additional products and it takes less time to get ready in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have referred this product to many people and now my sister and her family and brother and his family are using this. They are all very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. Your hair will look amazing in less than a week.</li>
    <li> This product does not disappoint. I&#x27;ve tried a few in this line, which ingredients&#x27; lists always set my expectations sort of high, sort of quizzical.  How might that Panthenol, Lysine HCl, and Hydrogenated Coconut Oil manifest in my hair?  With glycerin?  I&#x27;m so in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month in the hospital, just now, my hair and skin are ravaged.&lt;br /&gt;I look and feel old and used up.&lt;br /&gt;Wait, no:&lt;br /&gt;Looked. Felt.&lt;br /&gt;Whatever your hair or skin type -- I&#x27;m an OIL FREE addict, myself -- this stuff is going to be appropriate and doubtless useful.&lt;br /&gt;This head of fine blonde hair hasn&#x27;t had a frizz in its life. Yet the difference this makes overall is stupendous.  My horrific post-hospital facial skin texture is proved, not put at risk by the coconut oil and glycerin. The formula is just right.My hair and scalp, after two washings [with random shampoo. my bathroom got reorganized in my absence by a well-meaning mom] and conditionings my hair is so vibrant, compliant, full of joie de vivre even, I look and feel like a million bucks. This stuff made the difference.&lt;br /&gt;That my identity can fall back together with just a few applications of a thing I can find at the drug store... Tremendous.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying the whole line on subscription, from now on.&lt;br /&gt;And looking to see if they can help with my poor 02 mask/intubation fu chin/t-zone situations. Something tells me they can, and I look forward to further overall-health-inducing thrills.</li>
    <li> Works as any other conditioner.  Doesn&#x27;t control my frizz or dryness.  I will probably not buy it again even on sale.</li>
    <li> The best thing I have found so far to deal with my miserably frizz prone hair.  I look forward to having this in my shower as I approach the winter months.</li>
    <li> My biggest problem is the frizz especially with this humid weather.  This conditioner left my hair really soft and didn&#x27;t weigh down my natural wavy hair which is nice.  My hair is fine/med and long about 3 inches below my shoulders.  I used it with a sulfate free shampoo (not the same brand) and the nice smell blended well with the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is thick and creamy so I don&#x27;t have to use much.  As for the frizz, it helped much more than other conditioners but I still have some frizz.  If I use too much,  it can cause some greasiness and since I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday and I end up with pasty hair.  I would like to try it with the shampoo of its kind to see if it does a better job.  So far it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> I have tried several offerings from the Clear line of products. The theory is that they nourish the scalp resulting in healthier hair. Mostly I have not been impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the Clear Frizz control is fantastic.I have very long hair but I still don&#x27;t need to use tons. It spreads easily though my hair. It smells lovely fresh but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger other than your hair just smelling clean. I take cold showers and the conditioner still leaves my hair silky and rinses out well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is smoother and does not puff up during the day. My hair has a nice slip to it and falls beautifully. It is not stiff or dry at the tips. It doesn&#x27;t feel coated, just silky and good.</li>
    <li> This conditioner, in addition to the accompanying shampoo, really do leave a noticeable difference in the frizziness of my hair.  Granted, I will still need extra leave in conditioners on especially humid days.  But on normal days, all I need is the shampoo and conditioner to keep my hair from looking like a bad day on the I Love Lucy show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleased with a lot of the Clear skin and hair products.  They work as advertised and feel much more pure and less chemical-like.</li>
    <li> I tried this conditioner and it leaves my hair feeling incredibly soft. I have an easier time blow-drying my hair straight after using this conditioner, and I&#x27;m able to dry it much straighter without the frizz. The conditioner smells soooo good, just like the other Clear products. I have thin, fine somewhat oily hair that is color-treated. The conditioner really helped the dryness my hair suffers from haircoloring. But it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy or coated. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love frizz control. Living in Florida where it is humid, my hair will frizz out or go limp. After using the clear Scalp for seven days I did see a bigger diffeence. my curls stayed curled and did not kink up. I like that it left it more easy to comb and to style as well. The scent is great and will not follow you out the door, but it will work and you will get better results using this everyday on your hair.</li>
    <li> I like this product, it&#x27;s a very pale pink, almost white, and it&#x27;s really neither thick nor thin.  The bottom opens on the bottom and it&#x27;s fairly easy to open and it is nice that the conditioner stays at the bottom, so it helps you use it up without having to shake the bottle or thump it so the conditioner goes to the opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does control frizz very well when used with the companion shampoo.  I find I don&#x27;t have to use serum.  That said, it also makes my hair a tad limp.  It pulls the wave out a bit.  This would probably be great if you like a straight look anyway.  It leaves hair soft, and doesn&#x27;t seem to leave any buildup that contributes to tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light, and clean.  It&#x27;s neither masculine or feminine and isn&#x27;t overly strong to me.  It lasts for about half a day then I don&#x27;t notice it anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m constantly looking for a good, relatively inexpensive conditioner that can make my wavy, frizzy hair nice and smooth without the hassle of a straightening iron every morning. This is a decent enough product, but it doesn&#x27;t have the effect that I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the good: this conditioner didn&#x27;t do any harm. I&#x27;m always worried that anti-frizzing conditioners will turn out to be overly heavy or greasy, but that wasn&#x27;t a problem at all here. It left my hair in a reasonable state, maybe with a bit less frizz than sometimes, but certainly not perfectly smooth. Unfortunately, I think the focus on anti-frizzing may have detracted a bit from some of the other things that I want from my conditioner, because it didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling any softer or silkier at all. Basically, my hair looked okay, but felt worse than with other conditioners I&#x27;ve used in the past. I still have nothing really against this conditioner, and will use up the bottle, but it just isn&#x27;t something that I see myself buying again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final note about the bottle: at first I appreciated the design, which opens from the bottom so that conditioner is always available right at the opening. But as the bottle has become emptier, I&#x27;ve found that I actually have trouble getting any conditioner out, even though there&#x27;s still a lot in there. I think the design may be blocking any air from getting in, so that squeezing is ineffective, because it just remains in a permanently squeezed state? It&#x27;s weird, anyway, and I&#x27;ve never had this problem with a conditioner bottle before.</li>
    <li> If you use this in conjunction with the Frizz Control Clear Shampoo, you will experience good results for the first several washes if your hair is prone to weather-based frizzing. After this, it becomes kind of average in terms of help and you will need to use a serum or similar product to help tame your hair on worse days -- at least I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner&#x27;s consistency is only slightly different than the shampoo which is kind of interesting. It does rinse clean despite this.</li>
    <li> This seems like it does help a bit. It doesn&#x27;t work magic and completely eliminate frizz on its own, but it does seem to add to the other products that I use to create a better overall result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have any overwhelming smells and using it requires some diligence in rinsing but isn&#x27;t a big deal otherwise. On the whole, this is probably something I&#x27;ll actually end up buying from time to time.</li>
    <li> I have thin and fine hair.  I tried this conditioner, as well as the same type of shampoo  [[ASIN:B00AAIOP44 Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Therapy Frizz Control Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]]. This particular product is just not a good match for my hair type. Even after thoroughly rinsing, I could feel a greasy residue in my hair and on my scalp. I only used this conditioner for 2 days, and my hair looked limp and greasy both days. On the 3rd day, I used a clarifying shampoo to finally rid myself of the residue from both the shampoo and the conditioner. This product would probably be better suited to a person with thicker, coarser hair than my own.</li>
    <li> If only because you need so little for it to do its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this in combo with the Cear Scalp and Hair Beauty Therapy Frizz Control shampoo, which in itself, is very thick. You don&#x27;t need much of the conditioner, unless you&#x27;re Little Orphan Annie. A dab&#x27;ll do ya.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works nicely with the matching shampoo, especially if used in a rotation with other shampoos and conditioners. Great price, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the few pennies it&#x27;ll cost, I recommend both as a third shampoo/conditoner set in your rotation (you are rotating the shampoos you use, right?)</li>
    <li> I have been using the [[ASIN:B00AE078TM Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Therapy Frizz Control Nourishing Daily Conditioner]] along with the [[ASIN:B00AAIOP44 Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Therapy Frizz Control Nourishing Shampoo]].  My hair is mid-back length, naturally curly and also color treated.  With the conditioner I use it everyday, but for the shampoo I have found that it&#x27;s best for me to use it every other day. I have noticed a bit less frizz in my hair, which is most likely from my hair being less dried out.  The conditioner also has a nice scent that stays with my hair even though it rinses clean.  Overall I am very pleased with the results of the two products combined and the price isn&#x27;t so high that I can&#x27;t afford for it to be my regular brand.</li>
    <li> With summer humidity comes more frizzy hair.  I have used this Clear Scalp and Hair Conditioner in conjunction with the shampoo made by the same manufacturer several times and it has left my hair relatively smooth and frizz free.  My hair has also been without the tangles and knots that too often have to be combed out when it is newly washed.  A decent product at a fair price.</li>
    <li> This conditioner made my hair soft and manageable.  I&#x27;ve used a number of different products in this line, and I&#x27;ve found this conditioner to be comparable to the others.  I didn&#x27;t think that this conditioner was necessarily any more frizz-controlling than the others (I&#x27;ve used the color care, the extra moisturizing, and the normal hair one).  It&#x27;s a good conditioner, and one I&#x27;d definitely buy when in the market for a drugstore conditioner, just don&#x27;t expect it to be a frizz-managing miracle-worker, because it is not.  Overall, good value and works well.</li>
    <li> I was equally not thrilled about the corresponding shampoo. The conditioner, like the shampoo, felt heavy and over-scented. I think I could have liked it if it actually delivered on the frizz control promise but it did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No thanks.</li>
    <li> I used this in conjunction with the frizz control shampoo by the same company, and I liked it for the most part. It did not feel greasy when applied to my hair, and it also did not seem to be too thick or too thin. It does have a pretty heavy odor, so if that is not something you like, beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let my hair dry without any other products in it to see what it looked like. My hair definitely felt clean, and on the second day, there was still no buildup which I tend to get from products like Dove. There was also no frizz, and it has been very humid in my area. The one thing I am not happy with is the lack of shine in my hair. It did such a great job of cleaning that it took away the shine. I was able to restore the shine with a blow dry and some Chi silk, but it sold be nice to air dry and have great-looking hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was still pleased with this product and would buy it.</li>
