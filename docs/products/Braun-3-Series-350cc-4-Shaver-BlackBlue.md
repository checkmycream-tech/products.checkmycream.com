      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found the Braun Series 7 shavers to be excellent overall.  </li>
      <li>Better to buy in bulk if you</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using electric razors since 1984 and this one is at the top.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found the Braun Series 7 shavers to be excellent overall.  </li>
      <li>Gives a nice smooth shave - about 90-95% of what a quality blade will do without the hassle..</li>
      <li>This shaver is a 5 or more star</li>
      <li>Love the wet/cold feature.</li>
      <li>After using it for about 2 months, I can say that I&#x27;m completely satisfied with it.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t pay more than $99 for it.</li>
      <li>something years of shaving and found this foil shaver to be more comfortable.</li>
      <li>Battery charge easily allows for about 10 days&#x27; shaving (although ymmv).  </li>
      <li>So i started washing my face with soap and hot water, then towel drying until the skin was no longer clammy, then shave and the results were amazing.  </li>
      <li>Very good dry razor.  </li>
      <li>With a Panasonic, the motor is more powerful so there is never any pulling.</li>
      <li>So all I needed was the razor, and this fit the bill.</li>
      <li>Indicator light tells you when to change the razor cassette (about 18 months, give or take).&lt;br</li>
      <li>If your oily like me that will be great for razor glide but your neck hairs will never stand up enough.  </li>
      <li>It has a light in the handle that tells you when the foil &amp; cutter cassette needs to be replaced, which is about 18 months.</li>
      <li>One thing to try for those of you who find the shave isnt close enough as i did originally, is to ignore the whole dont wash you face thing in the for best results section.  </li>
      <li>Shaves better than any Norelco I have had right out of the box.</li>
      <li>Three levels of closeness at touch of button, sideburns trimmer very useful.</li>
      <li>I did the research before buying this one and found it edged out the rest by a significant margin.  </li>
      <li>Recently bough this and really love how fast it is and gives a great shave</li>
      <li>If the number is followed by &amp;#34;S&amp;#34; then the razor is sold Solo (without the Clean &amp; Charge base).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
      <li>Close clean shave with lather at sink or in shower without lather.</li>
      <li>I bought my Braun 740s-6 at Costco when they had a special deal on it.  </li>
      <li>I get a very close shave, it does a good job of removing flat-lying hair, the battery lasts a long time after a full recharge, and it&#x27;s very easy to clean under running water.  </li>
      <li>The end result was a very close shave, but it took many more passes than my Panasonic, which means shaving too much longer.</li>
      <li>Overall, it is a good razor.</li>
      <li>I bought this shaver at Costco for $159.95 and have only used it one time, but I am delighted with the way</li>
      <li>After a quick charge, I shaved my 1 day of growth.</li>
      <li>Super shave.</li>
      <li>For the last couple of years I have been shopping for the perfect shaver, either a standard blade type or electric.</li>
      <li>gives smooth and fast shaves.</li>
      <li>However, if you are just moving over to this shaver from a rotary or a blade then you will have to have a month&#x27;s worth of patience as you adapt to how it works and feels.  </li>
      <li>Not quite as good as the Norelco for wet shaving.</li>

      <li>I have not found the swiveling head to be useful for my face.</li>
      <li>As I shaved I noticed it took many passes to completely shave.</li>
      <li>It does work very well and has a good feel and a high speed (but quiet) sound that adds confidence while using.  </li>
      <li>pleased to say my first shave with this shaver was a complete success.</li>
      <li>Just doesn&#x27;t seem as strong as my old razor.    </li>
      <li>Overall I am pleased with this purchase, and being made in Germany was a consideration in the selection.</li>
      <li>I tried the Phillips electric rotary and it showed promise at first</li>
      <li>Overall, I find shaving with it to be both quick and comfortable.  </li>
      <li>This is the most I was going to spend on a shaver of any type, I was reluctant at first, but I decided to do it as all the money I had spent already on shavers that didnt work for me was getting higher.</li>
      <li>it really cut the hell out of my face.</li>
      <li>I tried multi-blades, the refills cost too much and the shaver was prone to clogging, plus it still cut my face at times.</li>
      <li>The pulsonic vibrations do not offer much feedback about what has been shaved and what has not.</li>
      <li>I bought the head replacement to be ready for the moment when the shaver indicates the necessity of change.  </li>
      <li>The pulsonic system vibrates much like a Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
      <li>NO irritating rash and a clen shave.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Variable 3-step intensity depending on how much growth you need to shave off.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so much</li>
      <li>That old razor was still working fine until the plastic part that holds the cutter head broke recently, and no replacement part is to be found.  </li>
      <li>I had tried foil shavers years ago and wasnt that impressed as the blades would dull in a few weeks.</li>
      <li>I guess it has to do with the razor pulling the skin slightly before the cutters, not for sure</li>
      <li>The description said NEW.</li>
      <li>I even bought a new Norelco and it made my neck even worse.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I ordered a NEW braun series 7 wet/dry electric shaver.</li>
      <li>Since all the Series 7&#x27;s shave the same, the fancy LCD display on the higher end models is for vanity only.&lt;br</li>

      <li>Man was I surprised!</li>
      <li>It does work better than any of the Remington&#x27;s that I have owned in the past 30 years.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s clear that this product was used and then &amp;#34;cleaned&amp;#34; to try and appear new.</li>
      <li>Maybe it has to do with the new, pulsonic action.</li>
      <li>But two month after a year of been purchase, without any advice it begins to make a different noise, not the normal smooth and regular, and definitely the shaver is not working now.  </li>

    <li> I bought this shaver at Costco for $159.95 and have only used it one time, but I am delighted with the way it shaves.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Norelco rotary shavers for 30+ years, but started to get a painful red neck rash when shaving. I even bought a new Norelco and it made my neck even worse.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased to say my first shave with this shaver was a complete success. NO irritating rash and a clen shave.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold on the Braun shaving foil system!</li>
    <li> Great razor. Love the wet/cold feature. Super shave. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought a Braun Series 7 for myself I love it so much I that I bought my to sons one for Christmas.</li>
    <li> As did another reviewer, I dropped my old razor with predictable results--I had two or three parts scattered across my bathroom tiles. So all I needed was the razor, and this fit the bill. I always want one Braun operational for shaves.</li>
    <li> Provides pretty much perfect shaves</li>
    <li> Like others this was bought at Costco. Cannot use when plugged in, very frustrating for me. Does not shave as quickly as my old Braun contour 5865. Feels a little flimsy like it might break, but perhaps that is because I&#x27;m used to the old Braun that was one solid piece and did not have the swiveling head. I have not found the swiveling head to be useful for my face. Just doesn&#x27;t seem as strong as my old razor.    The trimming piece snaps out at a 90° angle from the razor, and it is therefore difficult to see in the mirror because the main razor gets in the way--very hard to do the fine detail trimming I like to do at the bottom of my mustache.    They apparently don&#x27;t make my Braun contour razor anymore, but I&#x27;m going to try harder to find the old razor. It was great until it broke after years of use.</li>
    <li> Recently bough this and really love how fast it is and gives a great shave</li>
    <li> Close, close, close shave.  Extremely well made...gives smooth and fast shaves.</li>
    <li> It does not cut long hairs in the area below the nose. It does not shave vey close. Even after shaving I leaves a visible beard,</li>
    <li> I bought it in April 2014. Excellent performance during the first year of use.  I bought the head replacement to be ready for the moment when the shaver indicates the necessity of change.  But two month after a year of been purchase, without any advice it begins to make a different noise, not the normal smooth and regular, and definitely the shaver is not working now.  It is very weak for a product that supposed to exceed our expectations with 7 year last.</li>
    <li> I ordered a NEW braun series 7 wet/dry electric shaver. The description said NEW. When the package arrived and I opened it, it smelled weird like cleaning chemicals and obviously was used. There were already tons of tiny hair clippings in between the razor and in the box. It&#x27;s clear that this product was used and then &amp;#34;cleaned&amp;#34; to try and appear new. Not cool, false advertising....Now I&#x27;m going to end up having to throw it away and buy a new one because last thing I want is to be shaving with some razor that some stranger has already been using. Gross. I should get my $$ back but I doubt anyone who repackages a used razor and lies about it being new would be civil enough to do a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;XO</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item, on sale, at Costco. In less than a week, the head lock  broke. Another disappointment was to find out that the shaver works on battery only and not when it&#x27;s plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new shaver was meant to be a replacement for my several years old 7505 Braun that still works, corded only, since the battery no longer holds the charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no comparison between the quality of the shave; this may be subjective, but my skin feels a lot smoother after shaving with the old 7505. Maybe it has to do with the new, pulsonic action. Another negative, for me at least, is that the pouch holds the shaver only. There is no room for the cord, which is, somewhat, inconvenient when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, Costco return policy allowed me to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still in the market for a replacement, but, in spite of having used Braun shavers for over 45 years, I&#x27;m hesitant to get another Braun.</li>
    <li> I bought my Braun 740s-6 at Costco when they had a special deal on it.  After using it for about 2 months, I can say that I&#x27;m completely satisfied with it.  Others provided an in-depth review, so I&#x27;ll just mention the features that stood out to me: I get a very close shave, it does a good job of removing flat-lying hair, the battery lasts a long time after a full recharge, and it&#x27;s very easy to clean under running water.  So far I haven&#x27;t found any problems with this shaver that bother me.</li>
    <li> Not as great as I thought it would be but does shave OK.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice electric shaver. But don&#x27;t spend over $100 for it. In my opinion no electric shaver can shave close enough, so why spend $100. I have been using a rotary shaver all my 30 something years of shaving and found this foil shaver to be more comfortable. It may not cut as close as some rotary shavers but my face isn&#x27;t as irritated.</li>
    <li> pinches and shave one day and need another shave the very next day., what would you recommento ge a closer and better shave that last at least 2 day....please advise asap  may want to sent it back and get one that you can recommend</li>
    <li> I am happy with its performance getting nice clean shaves .</li>
    <li> Shaves better than any Norelco I have had right out of the box. I used Braun years ago and wonder now why I switched. I&#x27;ve been using electric razors since 1984 and this one is at the top. Don&#x27;t pay more than $99 for it.</li>
    <li> For the last couple of years I have been shopping for the perfect shaver, either a standard blade type or electric. I tried single blades, which didnt work they cut my face. I tried multi-blades, the refills cost too much and the shaver was prone to clogging, plus it still cut my face at times. So I tried a Norelco Rotary. It didnt give me a close shave like I wanted and it took too long to get a not so close shave. I tried the Phillips electric rotary and it showed promise at first but it seemed the rotary blades dulled soon after I had it for 3 months. So I bought that single blade shaver as advertised on TV by the Pawn Star guy. Not only was I over charged for the extra blades it really cut the hell out of my face. I decided to try one last time at a solution to my problem. So I bought the Braun Series 7 model 740s-6 electric Wet &amp; Dry foil shaver. This is the most I was going to spend on a shaver of any type, I was reluctant at first, but I decided to do it as all the money I had spent already on shavers that didnt work for me was getting higher. So I spent the $120. or so money and bought the Braun. Man was I surprised! This is THE BEST ELECTRIC SHAVER I have had EVER. I had tried foil shavers years ago and wasnt that impressed as the blades would dull in a few weeks. Today it seems Braun has re engineered the foil shaver. I have had mine now for 3 months and it performs flawlessly  It has a light in the handle that tells you when the foil &amp; cutter cassette needs to be replaced, which is about 18 months. At 23 bucks for the cassette, I say that is a deal. If you are looking for the closest, quickest shave, I definitely recommend the Braun Series 7 Wet &amp; Dry foil shaver. There are several models in the Braun foil shaver line to choose from. This shaver is a 5 or more star and I recommend it! Richard C.</li>
    <li> Great razor.  Best one I&#x27;ve used (and I&#x27;ve used them all).</li>
    <li> Great shaver, best I ever had. Delivery &amp; condition as advertised.</li>
    <li> Works well but does not shave as closely as others claim.  Takes a long time to complete a shave and does not do 100%.</li>
    <li> My Panasonic ES8228 was 5 years old when the cleaning station stopped worked. I continued using it but wanted to upgrade to something newer. Costco had the Braun on sale so I bought it to try. After a quick charge, I shaved my 1 day of growth. The pulsonic system vibrates much like a Sonicare toothbrush. I found that feature annoying. As I shaved I noticed it took many passes to completely shave. The end result was a very close shave, but it took many more passes than my Panasonic, which means shaving too much longer. When I thought I was finished, I felt my face but kept finding areas that were missed. The pulsonic vibrations do not offer much feedback about what has been shaved and what has not. With my Panasonic, I can hear and feel the hairs being cut so I know I am done. Today I returned the Braun to Costco.    I also tried the Braun 790CC and it was uncomfortable to use. It pulled my facial hair. I returned that one also.    I still have my Panasonic ES8228 and plan to replace it with another Panasonic model. With a Panasonic, the motor is more powerful so there is never any pulling.</li>
    <li> The shaver itself is wonderful.  It said cane with oil and brush.  There was no oil or brush in the package!</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s only two months old and still sharp.  It does work very well and has a good feel and a high speed (but quiet) sound that adds confidence while using.  The foil head is complex and thus the expensive cost for a new one. A single charge lasts all week unlike previous battery powered razors. It does work better than any of the Remington&#x27;s that I have owned in the past 30 years.  It&#x27;s a toss-up to the Braun model 5352 that I bought in 1977.  That old razor was still working fine until the plastic part that holds the cutter head broke recently, and no replacement part is to be found.  Overall I am pleased with this purchase, and being made in Germany was a consideration in the selection.</li>
    <li> I received an incredible price on this Braun product.  This was a Christmas gift for my Dad.  He loves it.  The best electric Braun razor he has ever had.</li>
    <li> Having tried several mid-range electric razors from all the top manufacturers over the years and always having been somewhat disappointed, I&#x27;m finally satisfied.  I did the research before buying this one and found it edged out the rest by a significant margin.  Overall, I find shaving with it to be both quick and comfortable.  It does a very good job.  The only (nearly insignificant) negative I can ascribe to it is that I wish its trimmer were straight rather than slightly curved.  Comes in several versions which differ in accessories and whether or not it&#x27;s wet/dry compatible.  (Note that the wet/dry version will NOT operate while the power cord is engaged for safety reasons.)  Battery charge easily allows for about 10 days&#x27; shaving (although ymmv).  Great razor.</li>
    <li> At 1st, I was going to return this thing until I read to not press to hard on your face.  You need to let the coils do their thing.  Now I get a great shave.  It is important to let the shaver dry off if you use it wet or it will smell like butt.  I made the mistake of cleaning it with water then place it in the traveling case and I could not get rid of the smell for weeks.  My charge of the razor lasted 12 shaves.  Impressive.</li>
    <li> Very good dry razor.  Not quite as good as the Norelco for wet shaving. (Norelco recently redesigned their shaving head for the razor I have and they ruined it.  That is why I am now using a Braun).  Overall, it is a good razor.</li>
    <li> Its like getting the 799 without the clean and renew base.  Sure the LED panel on the bottom isn&#x27;t as sophisticated but your whiskers don&#x27;t seem to mind. It does a great job on stubble.  One thing to try for those of you who find the shave isnt close enough as i did originally, is to ignore the whole dont wash you face thing in the for best results section.  If your oily like me that will be great for razor glide but your neck hairs will never stand up enough.  So i started washing my face with soap and hot water, then towel drying until the skin was no longer clammy, then shave and the results were amazing.  No more multiple passes and the hair seemed to just disappear under the razor.  I guess it has to do with the razor pulling the skin slightly before the cutters, not for sure but it works.  This makes for a very good shave without ingrown hairs.  If you want blade close, then you will need to shave like your using a blade.  Lather up and give that a whorl.  Personally thats how i get the best shave from it.  But if your prone to ingrowns i would avoid it.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Braun 740S as a replacement for my former 760cc that I dropped and broke.  All of the Series 7 shavers use the exact same razor cassette and have essentially the same features (Pulsonic, trimmer, variable intensity).  The only difference is the status panel on the end of the shaver (LED lights or an LCD display) and if it comes with a Clean &amp; Charge base or not.  Since I already had the base from my former shaver, all I needed was a replacement razor and the 740S does not come with the Clean &amp; Charge base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any Series-7 model with &amp;#34;CC&amp;#34; at the end of the number comes with a Clean &amp; Charge base.  If the number is followed by &amp;#34;S&amp;#34; then the razor is sold Solo (without the Clean &amp; Charge base).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my personal observations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;+  Works with the existing Clean &amp; Charge base from other Braun 7-Series shavers.&lt;br /&gt;+  Gives a nice smooth shave - about 90-95% of what a quality blade will do without the hassle..&lt;br /&gt;+  Charge lasts a long time (about 10 shaves for me).&lt;br /&gt;+  Variable 3-step intensity depending on how much growth you need to shave off.&lt;br /&gt;+  Indicator light tells you when to change the razor cassette (about 18 months, give or take).&lt;br /&gt;+  Came with a nice travel case and cleaning brush for when I&#x27;m away from home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;-  Flip-out trimmer takes some getting used to because it opens up at a 90-degree angle.  This trimmer is also fragile and easily broken if you drop the shaver (which is what happened to me).&lt;br /&gt;-  While it gives a nice, close shave it takes quite a few strokes and a little bit of patience to achieve it.&lt;br /&gt;-  If you stick with genuine Braun Clean &amp; Renew fluid for the base, it can get pricey.  Better to buy in bulk if you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Observations:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;  When the instructions say it takes 3-4 weeks for your beard to adapt to using this shaver - BELIEVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;  As a safety measure, since the 740S can also be used wet it will not operate when plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;  Since all the Series 7&#x27;s shave the same, the fancy LCD display on the higher end models is for vanity only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found the Braun Series 7 shavers to be excellent overall.  However, if you are just moving over to this shaver from a rotary or a blade then you will have to have a month&#x27;s worth of patience as you adapt to how it works and feels.  Too many times I&#x27;ve talked to people who have given up on it after only a few shaves because they expected too much from it too soon - I cannot stress this point enough.ot operate when plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;  Since all the Series 7&#x27;s shave the same, the fancy LCD display on the higher end models is for vanity only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found the Braun Series 7 shavers to be excellent overall.

    <li> Close clean shave with lather at sink or in shower without lather. Holds charge for a week without loss of cutting power. Three levels of closeness at touch of button, sideburns trimmer very useful.</li>
    <li> Awesome machine. I love it. Recommended!</li>
