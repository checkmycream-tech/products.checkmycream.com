    <li> Loved this little kit. I already love the BB cream and decided I would give the powder a try and I&#x27;m definitely a sucker for both now!</li>
    <li> Great product when you&#x27;re on the go!</li>
    <li> It causes irritation on me, because I have very sensitive skin.  I have tried MANY different brands and all make my face itch.  I am sure this product works well for most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do LOVE the flawless look I get after using the primer along with the make-up.  The BB cream is a bit heavy for me - I like much lighter make-up.  The powder is fabulous.  If I can find a brand that does this without making me itch, I would buy a life-time supply.  It is very nice make-up.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, breathable and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation.</li>
    <li> Great product, live the sample extras</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of BB cream, but I like the rest of the products.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t cover as good as expected and it was cakey and not smooth on my skin type. . . .  possibly the primer causing the issue</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love! My new beauty product for life!! I have lots of sun spots and sun damage. This makes my skin look young, covers up spots without looking fake. My husband even commented on how good it looked.</li>
    <li> Good sized samples - product works well with my skin tone...I think I&#x27;ve found my new makeup</li>
    <li> Perfect one month (plus a little longer) supply.</li>
    <li> As someone who has tried every &#x27;light&#x27; colored kit. I am hard pressed to find one that is for fair skin. This one had way too much yellow in it and it wasn&#x27;t even close to matching my skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this because the BB cream was rated so high.  The cream is very dry and doesn&#x27;t go on well and it gave my face a yellowish tint.  I much prefer eminence sun defense minerals.</li>
    <li> Great size to try it out before buying the larger size. Very nice make up. Love smash box. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Causes acne therefore I needed to return it.  The reason I use a BB Cream is because I am old and ugly and need to combat some adult acne that I get from my yoga mat.  BB Cream is called that because it stands for Blemish Balm or some say Beauty Balm either way it did neither of these things.  It was more of a pore clogging mask of horrors.</li>
    <li> This kits is great to give Smashbox a try. It is also great for traveling. I keep a &amp;#34;Try it&amp;#34; kit for use when traveling. The small sizes are perfect for my travel case. I love the Smashbox makeup. It goes on easy and for my use has decent coverage, I am not a fan of real heavy makeup, I just want a light weight makeup to smooth out imperfections. Smashbox Halo seems to fit the bill. And Smashbox Primer is my all time favorite. The pricing on Amazon is on-spot as well. And you cannot beat the shipping speed of Amazon Prime.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff but for the price, there is better. You cannot go wrong with it but honestly, find it cheaper</li>
    <li> I would  recommend this as a good value for a travel kit&lt;br /&gt; good for visiting to sunny places&lt;br /&gt;also for great coverage for evening wear</li>
    <li> Great buy for travel or someone who has never tried smashbox makeup, like myself.  The shade I chose was spot on &amp; lived up to my expectations!  The primer is amazing!!!  The liquid foundation followed by the halo powder, gives great coverage yet a natural look. I&#x27;ll be buying everything in the full sizes!</li>
    <li> Wow!  I love this, will be ordering more when I run out!</li>
    <li> Great product! I ordered this kit to take with me on a two week trip I was taking so I didn&#x27;t have to haul around all my full sized products. This was perfect!</li>
    <li> I am down away by these products! I will rate in the order of amazement with 1st being top favorite and then so forth and so on.&lt;br /&gt;1. Halo Hydrating Perfection Powder: Incredible! Works way beyond anything I could have imagined! This little jewel will be a part of my routine from now on!&lt;br /&gt;2. BB Cream &amp; Photo Finish Primer: Wow! Again, words cannot describe how happy I am with these products! A must have!</li>
    <li> Love every product in this box! Already need to buy the full size powder. This one lasted me about 2 weeks. Good size for travel or purse powder for touch ups.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and opportunity to try before investing in full size.</li>
