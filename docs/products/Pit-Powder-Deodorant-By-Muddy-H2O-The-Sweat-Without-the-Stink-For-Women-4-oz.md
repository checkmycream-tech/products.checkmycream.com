      <li>I&#x27;m all good.</li>
      <li>Because of the good reviews, I wanted to like this product, but it just did not work for me.</li>
      <li>And those don&#x27;t even work as good as this powder.  </li>
      <li>I found that pouring it into my hand and trying to get it onto underarm was fairly ineffective.  </li>
      <li>This is the first-ever product so good that I felt compelled to write a review.  </li>

      <li>This is absolutely the best deoderant I&#x27;ve ever used and smells great too.  </li>
      <li>And it works great at making sure you don&#x27;t sweat.</li>
      <li>The scent is very pleasant and mild.  </li>
      <li>I found that it sticks on best right after I get out of the shower.  </li>
      <li>Very effective for body odor under most circumstances.  </li>

      <li>and they now use it and love it too!</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>I am allergic to most deodorants but this was not a problem!</li>
      <li>Glad I found this!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very lightly scented, so while it smells good (kind of earthy and flowery), it doesn&#x27;t clash with whatever perfume I plan on wearing.</li>
      <li>This is an amazing product that was just told about to me by a friend.</li>
      <li>pit powder is amazing.  </li>
      <li>really the best!!!</li>
      <li>Really works and best for health</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with this product for this reason.</li>
      <li>I purchased a face brush applicator (the kind you use for applying powder make up) to evenly distribute the product.</li>
      <li>The powder keeps me from feeling sticky and it smells quite nice.</li>
      <li>but it does create a need for me to make sure I buy a good quality product.</li>
      <li>A friend of mine had recommended it to me and we are thrilled.</li>
      <li>The powder itself had a very strong herbal smell, which I didn&#x27;t mind.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s the best natural deodorant i&#x27;ve found!</li>
      <li>The best deodorant I&#x27;ve found, by far.</li>
      <li>It works fantastic and smells good too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many kinds of natural deodorants, but this one works the best for me.</li>
      <li>The first month it was GREAT.......</li>
      <li>It has a light and pleasant scent upon application, but it seems to work via its anti-microbial ingredients rather than by masking odors with strong perfumes.</li>
      <li>The scent is very light, and it feels silky going on.  </li>
      <li>This is a great healthy product and really works!  </li>
      <li>Smells fresh &amp; clean!!!</li>
      <li>sure to read all the print on the container</li>
      <li>but that is OK.</li>
      <li>And let me tell you, once this product wears out you better make sure you don&#x27;t lift those arms up.</li>
      <li>I have allergies but even when I didn&#x27;t, I didn&#x27;t care for most perfumed deodorants.  </li>
      <li>Much better.</li>
      <li>Powder costs more than roll-ons.</li>
      <li>It works but with my body I had to reapply about 2 times a day, which I don&#x27;t mind knowing I am putting something better on my body.</li>
      <li>Been using it for years and love it.</li>
      <li>I have tried anti-perspirants that claim to be the next best thing.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;i love pit powder and have been using it for 5+ years.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>this is my favorite deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I guess for what this product is it is ok.</li>
      <li>Ok, i&#x27;ll stop with the exclamation points now.</li>
      <li>whatever else seemed to work most of the day.  </li>
      <li>and I have to get the really potent ones to control my stinkiness.</li>
      <li>Not my favorite scent.</li>
      <li>Works as well as most deodorants.</li>
      <li>I ran out of my favorite UARMSOL and gave Pit Powder a try</li>
      <li>So safe to say its not for</li>
      <li>Make sure to read the description - this is NOT an antiperspirant.</li>
      <li>Applied more since I didn&#x27;t want to smell.</li>
      <li>The one thing I would mention is that the powder application takes some getting used to, so until you get good at it, put it on right after you get out of the shower</li>
      <li>But in my opinion, it works great and is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve tried, natural or traditional.</li>
      <li>I also love Weleda Wild Rose spray deodorant, which is effective but has a strong smell of roses that lingers all day (the smell does soften a lot, but I always catch whiffs of rose throughout the day when I wear it).  </li>
      <li>But it smells super nice</li>
      <li>I was very surprised and happy with the results of using this powder.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m a woman of a \\&quot;certain age\\&quot; with a variable internal heat source, and I can honestly say this is the best product on the market.  </li>
      <li>Pit Powder is easy to use and lasts literally all day.</li>
      <li>This is not as easy as a spray but on the plus side it does not damage the environment the way sprays do.</li>
      <li>While it is true that Pit Powder is very effective against odor, I ultimately developed a raging, stinging, itchy rash in one armpit, and then in both.  </li>
      <li>Started with stinging, and now a huge rash.</li>
      <li>This deodorant powder is just fantastic.</li>
      <li>this stuff works great, and is nontoxic, wish I could find it locally</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this is my favorite deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i apply once in the morning and that is usually enough. it doesn&#x27;t stop me from sweating, but it does keep the smell away! if it&#x27;s a really hot or stressful day, i might apply one more time. it works even if you apply after you&#x27;ve been sweating / stinking a bit. sometimes there&#x27;s a bit of &amp;#34;fallout&amp;#34; powder that you will notice on dark clothing, but that&#x27;s only with application and easy to brush away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love pit powder and have been using it for 5+ years. it&#x27;s the best natural deodorant i&#x27;ve found!</li>
    <li> I am one of those people with very sensitive pits. I get those horrible, itchy, spotty rashes that make you not even want to lower your arms all day. Then, one of my friends let me try Pit Powder. It is the single BEST natural deodorant I have ever tried (and the best deodorant ever considering how bad the other stuff is for you!) It really does cut out odor. I&#x27;ve worked out in this in the heat of summer and not needed to reapply until the end of the day. And the best part: no rash! It&#x27;s also very lightly scented, so while it smells good (kind of earthy and flowery), it doesn&#x27;t clash with whatever perfume I plan on wearing. The one thing I would mention is that the powder application takes some getting used to, so until you get good at it, put it on right after you get out of the shower and before you put any clothes on. But it&#x27;s worth it! The powder feels nice, especially compared to the chalky or plasticy feel of most roll on deodorants. An absolute 5 star product!</li>
    <li> i will continue my search for a deodorant.  Nothing seems to work.  my daughter has the same problem.  my mother had the same problem as well.</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant I can use, from all the other ones I get an allergic reaction, redness and itching.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for 5 years now without any problems.</li>
    <li> I have allergies but even when I didn&#x27;t, I didn&#x27;t care for most perfumed deodorants.  Didn&#x27;t like their smell and besides, most I tried simply didn&#x27;t work that well.  When my allergies kicked in I just quit using deodorant.  (Much to the chagrin of my close friends)    Then I tried Pit Powder and was amazed.  No sweet perfumy smell and without a doubt, the most effective deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried.      I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> i have very sensitive underarm skin.  regular deodorant causes my underarm to break out in a burning redness.  pit powder is amazing.  no smell and no irritation.  highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The first month it was GREAT.......then I started to itch to no end.  Had to stop using.</li>
    <li> I am confused.  I have used this for several years and loved it but it no longer seems to work for me.  I am smelly before the end of the day.  Before, I never had any odor as long as I used this.  Has there been a change in formula?  Who knows.</li>
    <li> With all the negative info out there about harmful ingredients in commercial deodorants, I was very happy to find this natural product.  It works great, smells good, and so do I when I wear it.</li>
    <li> I have used/tried countless deodorants/anti-perspirants.  Pit Powder is the only one that has worked and allowed me not to smell like a sweaty, stinky teenager (I&#x27;m 34!).  I have tried anti-perspirants that claim to be the next best thing.  They work for about a couple weeks and then my natural scent shines through at the end of the day.  The one type of deodorant I had never tried was a powder.  This did the trick!  I have been using Pit Powder solidly for over a year and have had 365+ days of no stink!  Amazing!  Plus, as a victim of breast cancer, I was seeking a natural option  (aluminum in deodorant has been linked to breast cancer, so who knows?), but had to default back to the traditional Secret or Dove or whatever else seemed to work most of the day.  BUY THIS deodorant!  5++++ stars!</li>
    <li> I was surprised by how well this deodorant worked to control odor. I have tried a lot of natural deodorants (Jason, Tom&#x27;s, and others) and they tend to leave me smelly at the end of the day. Some (Jason) are no better than just putting on nothing, and no deodorant results in a very stinky smell, almost like food but worse because it is coming from under your arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pit Powder really worked for me, no smell at all at the end of the day (though there was by the time I woke up next morning). Unfortunately, I have very sensitive skin and I got a rash within a day of using it, but the ingredients in the deodorant are very benign. Probably the culprit is one of the essential oils. I also rash up from Tom&#x27;s of Maine Calendula deodorant, but not from Almay Hypooallergenic antiperspirant (unfortunately that one has aluminum in it). If you are not sensitive and don&#x27;t rash up from Tom&#x27;s, you might not react to this either, and I think the stink-elimination is worth the try, though everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for me, I&#x27;m on to try other things.</li>
    <li> Based on the positive reviews I had high hopes for this product. I bought it one week ago because I wanted to use something that was natural but still worked for under arm odor. I don&#x27;t normally sweat under my arms but I do tend to get some odor. Its nothing extreme or anything like that but it does create a need for me to make sure I buy a good quality product. Before this purchase I was using Secret Cocoa Butter scent and the protection I recieved lasted me about a day and a half before I really needed to re-apply. However with this product I am only protected for about a day, if that, before needing to make sure I re-apply. And let me tell you, once this product wears out you better make sure you don&#x27;t lift those arms up. To myself I smelled much better after 24 hours of Secret then I did after 24 hours of Pit Powder. Much better. Oh and another thing to remember while using this product is that you may feel a very slight burning sensation, according to the box it is the nature of the botanicals/process of detoxification. Also, this is not a deoderant you put on when you didn&#x27;t have time to take a shower, this product will not mask any existing odors only mix them with this products slightly floral scent. I wish I could say more positive things about this product, as I had really high hopes for it. But you know for being all natural this product does work fairly good in comparison with some of the other all natural under-arm products out there. And it works great at making sure you don&#x27;t sweat. I guess for what this product is it is ok. But that is my opnion based on what I experienced. You should try it for yourself and see how you like it, our bodies do react differently when it comes to certain products so give it a try and see how you respond to it. If you don&#x27;t like it you can always return it. Hope this review helps.  ******EDIT******  I had a reaction while using this product. Please use cation. I have no history of allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! I am allergic to most deodorants but this was not a problem!</li>
    <li> I recently tried this deodorant, and am a total convert.  It really works, and it&#x27;s easy to use.  I also love Weleda Wild Rose spray deodorant, which is effective but has a strong smell of roses that lingers all day (the smell does soften a lot, but I always catch whiffs of rose throughout the day when I wear it).  I like to switch between that and Pit Powder--Pit Powder is good for when I want to be protected against odor but don&#x27;t want to smell like roses all day.  It smells almost like nothing, maybe just a very faint, fresh, herbal smell.  I highly recommend this product for anyone who wants to use a natural deodorant that really works, but without aluminum compounds or any other harmful ingredients.  It&#x27;s great stuff!</li>
    <li> Always like powder deodorants.Been using secret and it leaves residue on shirt.Powder costs more than roll-ons.Glad I found this! Not to mention shipping was fast!</li>
    <li> I have been trying to lean toward more natural deodorants (regular deodorants have been failing me for a while) and some of the others I have tried have been really disappointing. So many deodorants on the market smell so strongly that their purpose is to cover up your smell with theirs - but when odor starts, who likes to smell b.o. mixed with flowers or powder (or whatever). That was the problem I had. Reapplying only made the deodorants smell stronger, but didn&#x27;t get rid of pit odor.     I have been using the Pit Powder for about a week and a half and I love it. It has a very subtle scent that is pleasant and natural, not medicinal smelling. It is not something you can smell at any time (unless you are actually checking your arm pits for odor, lol). When I do check my arms - no body odor at all, just that barely there, natural scent. Even when sweating, the scent is not strong and body odor does not break through.    It&#x27;s a very fine powder and just a little gritty feeling, which worried me at first, but once it is on, I can&#x27;t feel it. I have read several reviews where people said it was messy. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with that. You really don&#x27;t need much, just tap it out. It&#x27;s better to put it on twice, because you didn&#x27;t quite get enough the first time, than put on too much and it go everywhere, which just wastes it anyway.     Make sure to read the description - this is NOT an antiperspirant. It does allow you to sweat. I do not sweat heavily, so this aspect hasn&#x27;t bothered me, as I was looking more for deodorant protection than antiperspirant. I have noticed that if I am sweating just a little, reapplying does help keep my underarms drier (as I expect any powder would do). Overall, I love this product, definitely one of the best deodorants in the many I have tried.</li>
    <li> Well, I bought this for the first time about two months ago. I just purchased Pit Powder for a second time because I told my daughters how good it was and they now use it and love it too! No one would be disappointed with this stuff. It works fantastic and smells good too.</li>
    <li> Smells fresh &amp; clean!!! The container holds about a 1/2 cup. (smaller than I expected). Works as well as most deodorants.</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with a thai crystal, especially during the summer here in Florida.  With the extra protection, and even though I walk between buildings every day where I work, I never worry about my pits.&lt;br /&gt;Besides, how can you resist something named &amp;#34;Pit Powder&amp;#34; and, even more, how can you resist a company named &amp;#34;H20&amp;#34;?</li>
    <li> I came on Amazon just to write this review even though I purchased this in my local Mom&#x27;s organic grocery store.  I have tried some other natural products and felt they didn&#x27;t really handle odor that well.  I would re-wash and reapply when I thought I could smell myself again.  Not with this.  I have been using it about two weeks but yesterday was the test.  Summer Saturday, an outdoor art festival, and hours out in the mid-Atlantic humidity and I was sweating but didn&#x27;t ever notice underarm odor.  I am sold.  I also hate what typical aluminum products do to clothing....yellow permanent sweat stains in the pits.  Hopefully this is as good for my clothing as it is for me.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this after seeing it in a holistic catalog and am totally excited about it.  I have tried many other natural deodorants and have always been disappointed.  So much so that I always go back to using the unhealthy ones (Secret) and I have to get the really potent ones to control my stinkiness. And those don&#x27;t even work as good as this powder.  I found that it sticks on best right after I get out of the shower.  Totally recommend this to all the stinky ladies out there... and the boys too!  My husband uses it and loves it as well.</li>
    <li> I have tried just about Every natural deodorant out there and only found one that &#x27;kind of&#x27; worked. After seeing this in a catalog that I trust I thought I might as well give it a try. I was Absolutely Amazed. This product actually works better than any deodorant/antiperspirant I have ever used natural or otherwise.  I had come to the point that I thought maybe I would just have to smell in order to help prevent breast cancer. Fortunately, (for everyone) thanks to Pit Powder, that&#x27;s not the case.  Not only have I had hot flashes for over ten years but I also have excessive perspiration so; if it works for me it should work for just about anyone. I have now bought Pit Powder and Pit Stop for everyone in my family so that they will all try it (my sister is now using it and is very impressed too). It&#x27;s just not worth getting cancer (or any other disease) for the sake of social morays and because of MuddyH20&#x27;s Pit Powder and Pit Stop you don&#x27;t have to make that choice. Try it for yourself and then tell everyone you know about it.</li>
    <li> Surprising how well this works. You have to sprinkle the powder into your hand and then apply it to your skin. This is not as easy as a spray but on the plus side it does not damage the environment the way sprays do. Also, this powder does no damage to your skin and leaves no residue yet it is extremely effective for the entire day.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Works all day in heat and humidity.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this stuff. I have used the powder for 2 weeks and my pits are raw and my skin darkened. You can actually see right where I applied the powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So instead of tossing it, I added it into my shoes. This is very nice. Now I sprinkle a bit in all my shoes and my feet are not as wet or smelly. Not a total loss, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing this product again. Until then I&#x27;m still searching...</li>
    <li> This is the best all natural deodorant out there smells great n holds up to this heat n texas</li>
    <li> I have tried so many natural deodorants (Tom&#x27;s of Maine, Jason&#x27;s, Hugo, Crystal Essence, and others that I don&#x27;t even remember the names of) without success.  Not only did none of them neutralize the smell but a few caused me to break out in rashes.  If it weren&#x27;t for concerns about breast cancer and alzheimer&#x27;s I would have given up the search.  I felt a bit of hope since I had never tried a powder.  Thank goodness I didn&#x27;t give up!  Pit Powder absolutely works for me.  The powder itself is not strongly scented so it does not interfere with perfumes etc.  Depending on what I am doing, I may have to reapply it in the afternoon.  However, when I reapply it it takes away any smell that may have started.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> This deodorant powder is just fantastic. I have tried the \\&quot;healthy/natural\\&quot; type stick deodorants in the local grocery stores, and also the ones in a very well known high end make-up store and those DID NOT WORK by the end of the day. One was over $18. Pit Powder is easy to use and lasts literally all day. I had almost given up on finding a product that worked. Fast service and delivery too. Happy customer.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised and happy with the results of using this powder. You can stay completly dry and comfortable a whole day.It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to go natural and don&#x27;t really have the time to make something at home so I thought I would try this.  I really wish it had worked but it didn&#x27;t.  I have been using it for two weeks and I still have the worst BO.  I guess I will keep looking.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, only thing I&#x27;ve found that keeps the stink at bay. I did have some irritation but found if I use toms of Maine stick deodorant first then powder I&#x27;m all good.</li>
    <li> People say this has little to no scent but the moment I put it on my hand I smelled it. It has a funky smell that I found just as bad as light b.o. Granted I have a very sensitive nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also hurt! It burned all day and when it stopped I started to stink. So I thought, well maybe it was just sensitive right after shower. Applied more since I didn&#x27;t want to smell. It hurt worse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I have red patches in my armpits from the irritation. So safe to say its not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will stick to the Naturally Fresh Deoderant Roll Ons. They are the only natural deoderant that has worked for me. I only have to apply it once or twice in a day. And letting it dry might be obnoxious but better than burning pits.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the powder did not work on my armpits. It worked for one day and the following days, the stink appeared. So I stopped using it. Sadly, I did not have the success that others have.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a girl that sweats a lot (in my opinion), so I&#x27;ve been leery of purchasing a deodorant-only product (vs. antiperspirant).&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews is I finally decided to give this a try.  I have been using it every day for about 2 months now, and I really do like it. (I may change my mind when summer heat hits, but we&#x27;ll see).  My only complaint is the slight patchouli scent... I hate that scent. Hate it.  However, it is subtle, and I can get beyond it.  I do still sweat, but hardly any odor. There have been a few times where I will reapply later in the day (I bought a tiny cosmetic container with a pouf to keep in my purse) when I was worried that maybe by nose wasn&#x27;t being honest. I&#x27;ve even asked my husband to tell me if there is any odor since switching, and he says no.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a deodorant that has only health-conscious ingredients, I&#x27;d recommend giving this a try.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I tried this, as I&#x27;ve tried several other natural deodorants and found them quite ineffective. I&#x27;ve been stuck using traditional chemical laden deodorants (Degree) for years as I haven&#x27;t found a natural alternative that didn&#x27;t leave me stinky at the end of the day (or really, by the middle of the day!). A friend suggested Pit Powder and I have been absolutely amazed at how well it works for me! I can wear it all day without developing that nasty sweat smell, which for me is a pretty amazing thing. It&#x27;s not perfect, I do still sweat since it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant, but like the package says, it doesn&#x27;t stink! Amazingly enough - I was going out with my husband the other day and was concerned about sweating, so I wore Degree to control the sweat, which I haven&#x27;t done in months - my husband actually noticed and asked if I was using a different deodorant. When I pressured him for more info, he admitted that the traditional deodorant I was wearing to control my sweat actually left me smelling less fresh than my usual Pit Powder! I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but saw that others have had sensitivity issues - I&#x27;ve been lucky not to experience this. But in my opinion, it works great and is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve tried, natural or traditional. If you have odor issues I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> It is better than some products but it is not great. still looking for the ideal product for me and folks like me.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It allows me to sweat with NO smell. I use some Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s no talc powder over it sometimes to keep me dry, as it is really hot and humid here in Texas this summer.</li>
    <li> I would give it a five star but it does not keep you from sweating. It keeps odor at bay and for the most part you stay fresh. However on a really hot day you will need to reapply often. If you don&#x27;t perspire much you will love this natural deodorant. I have repurchased this many times, and will continue to do so as it is completely natural and does not contain alum.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product that was just told about to me by a friend. it works great and is safer</li>
    <li> I had seen this product on several websites raving about it being all natural and effective.  I like the all natural and the powder itself smells great, but unfortunately it just did not work for me.  It did not prevent the BO, and it didn&#x27;t even mask it.  I did apply it immediately after showering and drying, but still was not stink free... : (</li>
    <li> Shared with daughter and granddaughter. Its the Best ever. A friend of mine had recommended it to me and we are thrilled.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  I have tried for a year to find a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorant that actually can control odor all day for me.  This is the only one that has come close, and it even works better than the extra strength antiperspirant/deodorant I had been using in terms of controlling odor (of course it doesn&#x27;t stop you from sweating but that part of the point of switching to a non-antiperspirant -- to let your body function as it is designed).  The scent is very pleasant and mild.  My husband is very sensitive to any kind of scent, even natural essential oil scents, and this doesn&#x27;t bother him at all.  The powder takes a little getting used to in terms of application, but once you get used to it it&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
    <li> I love the subtle scent, but, most importantly, it works well for me. The best deodorant I&#x27;ve found, by far.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing. I&#x27;m a nervous person, and thus I get &amp;#34;nervous sweat&amp;#34; which stinks more than regular, relaxed-person sweat. BUT I also don&#x27;t want to rub a bunch of aluminum on my armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first non-aluminum deodorant I&#x27;ve ever found that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DO have to apply it twice a day. And if I&#x27;m going to give a presentation or do something especially nerve-wracking, I&#x27;ll back it up with regular antiperspirant/deodorant. But for everyday use, it&#x27;s lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application: People have mentioned that it can cause rashes.  I have very sensitive skin, and I haven&#x27;t had this problem.  But I also don&#x27;t rub it into my skin, as the package suggests.  I like to shake some of it onto a cotton pad (like a make-up remover pad) and then dab that up in my armpits.  Works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I do have to sweep my bathroom floor more, as some of it always falls to the floor and collects in little dust pockets over time. But it smells super nice and it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff and will buy it again!</li>
    <li> Totally natural and effective deodorant.  This is my second order.  It really does the job without an overpowering fragrance.  Good stuff!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a cook by trade, and spend the day surrounded by a six burner range, three ovens, three deep fryers and a flat grill.  Add to that, I&#x27;m a woman of a \\&quot;certain age\\&quot; with a variable internal heat source, and I can honestly say this is the best product on the market.  I love that it is all natural, and the fact that I can walk out at the end of the day without smelling like an NFL locker room makes it a must have product for me.  The scent is very light, and it feels silky going on.  One package will last a lot longer than three or four of those \\&quot;chemical sticks\\&quot; I used before.      Update:  Orginal purchase was in May of this year,  now it is October and I&#x27;m finally finding the bottom of the container.  4 months for 7.99.....what a bargain!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all. This is it! No need to reapply later in the day. It did take a little while for me to get used to using it. For me it works best after applying some coconut oil. It seems to rub in better with that as a base for the powder to stick to. Since I use the coconut oil anyway as a moisturizer it fit well into my routine. I did feel like my body needed to &#x27;detox&#x27; from using antiperspirant for so long as the odor was a bit different for the first week or two. But, I stuck with it and Wow! I am a hairstylist so as I lean over my clients to do a shampoo it is so very important not to be stinky!</li>
    <li> Works. Very natural. A bit messy to apply powder, but I don&#x27;t mind for such a healthy product. Container last a very long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many kinds of natural deodorants, but this one works the best for me. Liquid or stick deodorants give me a rash sometimes and many still use propylene glycol which is known to irritate sensitive skin. The powder keeps me from feeling sticky and it smells quite nice. I recently tried a different natural powder deodorant and it didn&#x27;t work at all! I was smelly in a few hours. I regretted not saving the money and ordering Pit Powder. Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> I am just giving this the &amp;#34;it&#x27;s ok&amp;#34;  I am not a flower person and this was quite floral smelling.  It works but with my body I had to reapply about 2 times a day, which I don&#x27;t mind knowing I am putting something better on my body.</li>
    <li> Because of the good reviews, I wanted to like this product, but it just did not work for me. The powder itself had a very strong herbal smell, which I didn&#x27;t mind. But then at the end of the day, my B.O. was extremely foul compared to regular B.O. mixed with other deodorants, so this was tossed in the trash.</li>
    <li> I have tried every non-aluminum-containing, \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorant available, and finally gave up and began using conventional deodorants again.  Concern over the use of those substances persisted for me, however.  I then read about this product, and largely because it was reasonably priced and affordable, I tried it.  Amazingly, it absolutely DOES prevent underarm odor.  On the hottest days in the Deep South, perspiration is a nagging presence, but odor, never, with Pit Powder.  Criticisms offered here suggest that the powder has a \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; of its own, but literally within seconds of application, its slight \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; subsides.  This is the first-ever product so good that I felt compelled to write a review.  I hope it will be useful to prospective buyers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT UPDATE:  After having used this effective product for several weeks, it is with regret that I have to amend my earlier Review.  While it is true that Pit Powder is very effective against odor, I ultimately developed a raging, stinging, itchy rash in one armpit, and then in both.  I began to apply the powder to a couple of other areas of skin, wanted to see what happened, and soon enough the skin began to peel away, and in one very painful area, my skin peeled away, became raw-looking, then cracked open and bled.  It is a great disappointment to have to start again to look for an effective but aluminum-free deodorant, but clearly that time has come.</li>
    <li> I ran out of my favorite UARMSOL and gave Pit Powder a try but it just did not work with my body chemistry, I was stinky after a day. I  found the baking soda was really irritating as well. Back to Uarmsol ([...]) a natural deodorant that prevents bacterial growth so that odors are eliminated and you only need a tiny pinch. I don&#x27;t work for that company but appreciate a product that delivers</li>
    <li> This really does what it says.  Very effective for body odor under most circumstances.  Can be used all over.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe it! I&#x27;ve actually found a natural deodorant that works!! I did put it to the test today when i put it on before going to the gym (the other deodorant i was using usually stopped working after sweating 15 minutes), and I did not smell one bit. Now that&#x27;s a miracle!  Ok, i&#x27;ll stop with the exclamation points now.</li>
    <li> This is a great healthy product and really works!  I have been using it for years and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> Being post-menapausal,  I have experienced in the last few years a number of deodorants that just do not do the job for me.&lt;br /&gt;This powder works very well for me.  It is made in the United States by women for women (they also make a product for men.)</li>
    <li> Was using an all natural roll-on deodorant that was moderately effective, but this product far exceeds in performance.  Even after the 2nd day, it still holds its power.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I wish I&#x27;d known about it years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to read all the print on the container--the Pit Powder is a DEODORANT, not an anti-persperant, nonetheless, it&#x27;s well worth using because it does what it says it does, and it makes a big difference in how you  project yourself to others throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, despite being a powder, it&#x27;s NOT messy. Just put some in the palm of your hand, and spread it over your armpit--for both sides. It feels somewhat like baking soda, but it&#x27;s not baking soda--and it does smell better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several natural deodorants and been disappointed by all of them - except for Pit Powder. This powder actually does prevent underarm odor! Completely, even on a hot day. Although I have sensitive skin and a tendency to react allergically, this product has been completely comfortable to use. Everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different so this might not be the product for you, but it&#x27;s the first non-aluminum deodorant that I can recommend trying.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too patchouli or something. Not my favorite scent. I would rather smell sweaty than this. I use Botanical silver shield and it works great. [[ASIN:B0062A6YW0 Silver Shield Deodorant Original Formula]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using pit powder for a month.  It does keep the smell away, but I am very sensitive and after 4 weeks I have the worse kind of rash.  Started with stinging, and now a huge rash.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I have used it daily for the past several years. Its non irritating and keeps me nice and dry and smelling fine! I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> If only the powder were finer, this could be a good product. I usually do NOT have sensitive skin. But, because this powder is so coarse, putting it in my pits after a shower, really irritates the skin. I bought one of these for my mother too and she had the same complaint. I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I no longer worry about odor nor do I worry about chemicals on my skin. It&#x27;s a fabulous product.</li>
    <li> I use this powder on top of my all natural deodorant to help keep my dry and it is great for that. There is not much scent to it at all so it compliments whatever I am wearing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used two cans of this so far and I have to say it does the job very well. I&#x27;ve noticed that regular stick deodorants cause the skin in my armpits to itch and sometimes darken from irritation. This deodorant doesn&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction for me. And unlike stick deodorants, this pit powder doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my armpits at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback would be that if I&#x27;m doing strenuous activities, this might not be enough to last me throughout the day without letting some body odor leak through.</li>
    <li> this stuff really works! I purchased a face brush applicator (the kind you use for applying powder make up) to evenly distribute the product. I found that pouring it into my hand and trying to get it onto underarm was fairly ineffective.  What I do is pour a tiny bit of PP into the palm of one hand, use the brush in my other and swirl it around until it coats the top part of the brush, then apply to underarm - and it gets applied evenly and smooth.  I have CLEARLY marked the facebrush so NO ONE accidently uses it to apply make up (LOL) and plus I keep hygiene stuff in a different place then my make up, so no one should ever accidentally use it for make up, but just in case, it is clearly marked.  Highly recommend PIT Powder. I use it in tandem with the Schmidts Paste and it truly does eliminate the stink! I am very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> this stuff works great, and is nontoxic, wish I could find it locally</li>
    <li> This product effectively controls unpleasant underarm odor without harmful chemicals. It has a light and pleasant scent upon application, but it seems to work via its anti-microbial ingredients rather than by masking odors with strong perfumes. I&#x27;m thrilled with this product for this reason. I do not trust that conventional/chemical deodorants are safe, and some other natural deodorants just don&#x27;t prevent odor. This product is a standout! Recommended without reservation.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t perspire heavily, just wanted to have no stink by the end of the day. Most natural deodorants work for me the 1st half of the day- it&#x27;s not having to re-apply was what I was after. I started with cleaned arm pits- Pit Powder felt nice and dry at first, then got sticky by lunch, and stinky by 3pm. Maybe ok for the winter, but definitely not a summer time deodorant!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! Been using it for years and love it.</li>
    <li> As some of the other reviews have said, this product does work well but doesn&#x27;t  last all day. I have poured a small amount into a small bottle which i keep in my car to reapply occasionally as needed. I have tried many natural deodorants and none have worked for me. This one is the only one so far that does an acceptable job. It is obviously not going to work as well as a heavily chemical laden deodorant such as Secret but that is OK. I rather deal with having to reapply again late in the day then poison myself with chemical filled deodorants.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best deoderant I&#x27;ve ever used and smells great too.  It can be used on damp or dry skin and keeps you dry all day.  Bought the men&#x27;s version, Pit Stop, for my husband and he loves it.  My sister and her husband were leaving for vacation this past summer and I told them to give it a try, they wouldn&#x27;t regret it.  Needless to say, everyone&#x27;s happy with the performance!&lt;br /&gt;Only bad thing is the shipping, costs almost as much as the product.  Muddy H2O should really re-evaluate that.  I would definitely buy more than one at a time if it didn&#x27;t cost as much to ship as to the actual item itself :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 5/28/13 So in all fairness, I recently ordered more Pit Powder and a small note was included in the box \\&quot;free shipping on orders delivered within the USA,\\&quot; but you have to order direct - http://www.good-earthstore.com/servlet/StoreFront - sorry amazon!</li>
    <li> This product made me so happy and does what it says it will do......you do not STINK!!  I have searched for a product like this one for years.  I wanted something that was not gooey, sticky, wet, or would let you down in protection and this does it all.  You do not use much at all...shake the powder on your palm and rub into arm pit.  That&#x27;s it!! Wonderful!!  AND with no harmful ingredients like aluminum!!</li>
    <li> I think this is a brilliant way to use deordorant. Really works and best for health</li>
    <li> this really works for me..it goes on dry and I stay smelling fresh all day..I have tried many other deodorants and will stick with Pit Powder and its all natural..I&#x27;m on my second can..it last a long time..really the best!!!</li>
</ol>
