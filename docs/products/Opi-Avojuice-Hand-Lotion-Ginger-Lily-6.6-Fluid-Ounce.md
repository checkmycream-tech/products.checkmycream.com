    <li> the lotion smells wonderful and feels great on my skin..but it only lasts about an hour if that long..the bottle is also small for the pricing..</li>
    <li> Awesome lotion, very light and smells great! It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily or greasy and it soaks in quickly leaving your skin feeling softer and smoother than ever! This is my favorite lotion and I won&#x27;t use anything else. It&#x27;s perfect for any need, face, hands, legs, feet, etc.</li>
    <li> The size pictured is 20 ox this is not what is sold  6.6oz is sold.  Picture is misleading&lt;br /&gt;Seller needs to be very CLEAR in their description!  The product is fabulous the seller is not&lt;br /&gt;clear in their description and needs to be to avoid buyers feeling jipped.&lt;br /&gt;I ALMOST bought this then bought elsewhere because of it</li>
