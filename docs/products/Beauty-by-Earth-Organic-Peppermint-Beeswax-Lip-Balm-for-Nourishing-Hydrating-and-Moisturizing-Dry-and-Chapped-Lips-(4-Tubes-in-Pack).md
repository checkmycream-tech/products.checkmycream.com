<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great lip balm! Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave you lips wanting more 20 minutes later like a petroleum based product does.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this lip balm, but will have to return to my old faithful Chap Stick. This is way too &#x27;gritty&#x27;!</li>
    <li> I got htis Peppermint lip balm at a realy god price for my unbiased opnion.I realy like it, it has a great strong smell of pepermint, my lips realy like the feel and smell of it.I reccomend this.Im so glad that there was more than 1 in the box.</li>
    <li> For some reason this year I suddenly had extremely cracked dry lips and my usual remedies weren&#x27;t working.  I did some research and found this product and decided to give it a try since it had all the natural ingredients I was looking for without much else.  I have to say, this is the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used.  I only apply it once or maybe twice a day and at bedtime.  The others I was applying probably every hour and I was still having cracking and bleeding.  Now, they look normal again and I can eat and smile without pain and cracking.  I live in a very dry climate and this is probably the only lip balm I will ever buy from now on.</li>
    <li> These seem to be good. They don&#x27;t fall apart when you put it on. It&#x27;s good &amp; pepperminty.</li>
    <li> I love these lip balms! I&#x27;ll continue to buy these. They work very well, and don&#x27;t dry my lips out like other lip balms. Plus, the peppermint is wonderful!!</li>
    <li> This balm is very moisturizing and not waxy at all. My lips felt very smooth, there is no weird smell or taste, and it&#x27;s all natural which is awesome. Definitely better than Chapstick, on par with Soft Lips, would purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> The very best lip balm</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been addicted to ChapStick and it&#x27;s to the point where I&#x27;m constantly reapplying but it doesn&#x27;t even feel like it&#x27;s doing anything. I wanted some natural and more moisturizing. I love this lip balm so far!! Will definitely be ordering more when I run out!</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!!  This lip balm goes on smooth, and is so comforting.  I suffer from constant dry lips, and other lip balms make it worse.  I am very happy with this product.  I use it daily, several or more times a day.  I recommend this highly.</li>
    <li> The best lip balm I have ever tried.  Natural ingredients and a great peppermint taste.  Would make a great stocking stuffer for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out lips like other lip balms! Amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only have to use this once or twice a day and I feel so much more refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend keeping this product in a desk drawer or a bag, as it seems to be more susceptible to falling apart in heat. (don&#x27;t leave it in your car)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the thermal stability of this product, I highly recommend it to anyone with chapped lips who doesn&#x27;t feel like applying cheap lip balm 10 times an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flavors are pretty good, too. I have had both the peppermint and the green tea, and I would say either of these are good. The other flavors sound delicious, but I haven&#x27;t needed to order anymore yet</li>
    <li> Really usually don&#x27;t like mint flavored things but this is the exception. LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS! Love the taste love the smell super moisturizing and love the texture! You also get 4 of them in the pack! 100% recommend this.. I&#x27;m a lip balm addict and this is my new favorite!</li>
    <li> Never write reviews .&lt;br /&gt;Chapstick junkie cannot leave home without it&lt;br /&gt;Recently switched to Un processed diet purified water etc etc&lt;br /&gt;Wanted a real organic Chapstick with natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;This stuff rocks&lt;br /&gt;Ingredient list and the peppermint doesn&#x27;t make me sick when I apply it 50 times a Day or more (no joke)&lt;br /&gt;About 2.50$ a stick can&#x27;t beat it at all.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness! This lip balm is so wonderful! I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how great this product is. I have very sensitive skin and am on oxygen 24/7, so I cannot use petroleum products.  My daughter has also started using it, and she, too, has sensitive skin. I love that they come four to a box so I can share this awesome lip balm with friends. I have found my favorite peppermint lip balm! Finally, no more searching, no more throw aways, no more chapped lips! And get this, the wonderful peppermint flavor is like a sweet, little treat without the calories! Talk about the power of aroma therapy!  Thank you for this great product!</li>
    <li> I have been use some type of Chapstick or lip balm for over 40 years and This is the best lip balm that I have ever used!  It goes on so smoothly and feels so good. The mint flavor is wonderful and I love that it has all natural ingredients! I am so happy that I have found this product and have tossed away all other lip balms that I had been using.  I have given these to friends and they all have positive responses too.</li>
    <li> Having just had laser surgery on the face my lips were awfully chapped- and it isn&#x27;t even winter yet. This balm soothed and smoothed my lips- and instead of licking them- I want to rub them together to enjoy the feel!! Different from anything I have ever used before- and need to order MORE so I can stash them everywhere I sit.</li>
    <li> The previous reviews really do the product justice.  I have only had the lip balm for a day, but it really is absorbed quickly, and lasts for quite a long time without reapplication.  I also love the fact that it is made from all natural ingredients.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> These lip balms are great.  Smooth going on, last long,great tasting and smelling. Very soothing.  Great for winter time lips. I even put them on my 1 yr and 2 yr olds cheeks for extra protection on their face. Awesome!!  Going to be my stocking stuffers for many family members</li>
    <li> Definately the perfect scent and chapstick (lip balm) for me! I endlessly try natural products, and quite honestly so many fall short of my expectations. I just quit using them. I have no complaints with this one. It&#x27;s moisturizing and contains natural ingredients - which I&#x27;m very particular about. You won&#x27;t be let down. I will definately buy again! Have already ordered every scent I can find by this company.</li>
    <li> Better than expected, goes on smooth and has a lovely fragrance. There is a slightly sweet taste to it, hope it&#x27;s from the peppermint or beeswax. Overall, this is awesome lip balm and better than the mainstream stuff that&#x27;s filled with toxic junk.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best beeswax lip balm I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;m sure I will be ordering it again!</li>
    <li> Only had this for a few days, but seems to work really well! I love that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an alternative to Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s that works just as well, and this lip balm exceeded my expectations. It kept my lips well moisturized all winter, and the mint smells and feels nice (without being too overpowering). Even my boyfriend, who normally pays zero attention to the finer differences between personal care product brands, was immediately impressed by this lip balm. I&#x27;ll probably buy these as stocking stuffers next Christmas.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is great because it does not require constant reapplication; my lips seem to absorb the moisture and stay hydrated for several hours.  The peppermint is nice and not too overwhelming.  I like that there are 4 tubes because I tend to misplace tubes, so I can always have one handy.</li>
    <li> Great lip balm.  Love the way my lips feel soft and moisturized without any sticky heavy feeling.  The flavor is nice too.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly, smells devine, and stays on your lips (it doesn&#x27;t come off right away when you lick your lips or eat). Great addition my natural beauty products!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son who has chapped lips often and he said it was very soothing. thanks</li>
    <li> My lips are so soft. They were so dry and gross from winter weather. This balm is incredible</li>
    <li> great stuff, love the feel love the taste HAPPY HAPPY</li>
    <li> Love these lip balms , works wonders for dry lips</li>
    <li> Smooth with good coverage and had staying power. :)</li>
    <li> I wondering if this beeswax based balm could really be that much different to what you find everywhere in drugstores, and ... it is! My lips haven&#x27;t been this smooth, soothed, hydrated, and flake free in a really long time. The peppermint is luscious and intense. It feels very tingly especially at first. The formula is super silky and light with a natural, non-tacky finish. The hydration and protection last a really long time - at least four hours without reapplying and having eaten. I think this balm would actually be well suited for men because there&#x27;s no shine to the finish nor any sensation of wearing a lip product after the initial tinglyness wears off.</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm . For someone who constantly uses lip balm , I have come across many , but none like this one. It only takes one coat for you to immediately feel the moisturization on your lips as well as the minty fragrance it leaves. I highly recomend tu purchase this lip balm by Beauty By Earth.</li>
    <li> omg this is wonderful. My lips have felt so good in just the week I have been using this</li>
    <li> I love using the  Beauty By Earth Peppermint Lip Balm . I have been using the Peppermint lip Balm for my dry cracked lips and my lips are healed up now . The Beauty By Nature Peppermint  Lip Balm is made from natural ingredients and helps keep my lips soft and smooth . I love the natural flavor of Peppermint against my lips plus the moisturizers together are amazing . I recommend this product to anyone  . This is my opinion for my product review .</li>
    <li> ITS EXPENSIVE AS SHIZ NITS BUT ITS TOTALLY WORTH ITS&lt;br /&gt;LET ME TELL YOU&lt;br /&gt;NOTHING SAYS I LOVE YOU HONEYBEAR LIKE THIS STUFF&lt;br /&gt;ITS SO GOOD&lt;br /&gt;I WANT TO EAT IT&lt;br /&gt;RUB IT ON MY STOMACH&lt;br /&gt;RUB IT ON YOUR STOMACH&lt;br /&gt;I WANT IT EVERYWHERE&lt;br /&gt;GAHHHHH</li>
    <li> Great fresh scent. leaves my lips soft, and they smell like peppermint.  Win/win, lol.</li>
    <li> Excellent  product. I love all natural products and glad i found what  i was looking  for. It works excellent.</li>
    <li> I like EOS better.  I bought this one &#x27;cause all the great reviews, but it is kinda of &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34;.  I don&#x27;t know how to say it.  I put it on, it doesn&#x27;t say long, not enough that wax feel, it feels more liquid base.  anyway, try the EOS, stays on much better.  when I apply the EOS, it feels harder and dryer.  That is why it can stays on my lips longer.  This one feels softer and not as waxy, therefore, it is gone in a short time.  My husband says the same too.  Maybe just the pack we got.  It taste sweet, don&#x27;t know what makes it sweeter than other lip balm.</li>
    <li> My lips are very sensitive so I am and using this lip balm but also using my old one. I am hoping that this one becomes the one I can use.</li>
    <li> great natural lip balm, smooths and moisturizers and has a great peppermint flavor.  highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive. It&#x27;s not very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t last long. I don&#x27;t understand all of the high ratings.</li>
    <li> I loved this lip balm.I got exactly what i was looking for.Highly recommended for people who wants to take good care of lip.Great smell .....Will buy again !</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy to have found a lip balm that is all natural, no petroleum products or other harmful additives. Thank you for making this available and at a reasonable price.  We will be ordering again from this company on a regular basis.  I find my lips stay better for longer because I am not adding chemicals that would in reality dry them out and need more artificial moisture very quickly.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice lip balm. It&#x27;s soothing, is gentle on your lips, and doesn&#x27;t burn or leave an unpleasant aroma like some other balms do. It&#x27;s nice to know that the ingredients are natural. Best of all, you won&#x27;t find yourself constantly reapplying this every five minutes. One application is easily enough to last for at least a few hours. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will definitely order from this company again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product. Blessings!</li>
    <li> Quite an easy to use lip balm with a refreshing taste (Got mine with peppermint flavor). Just note though, keep it somewhere cool and not in your pockets if you live in the tropical zones (ie Hawai&#x27;i). The heat tends to detach the balm from the stalk from which it is attached.</li>
    <li> Works great! Best I&#x27;ve found so far! It also gives you that cool feeling!! Love this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> Some people like the mint fresh but for me it is little bit too much. So, here&#x27;s the warning: the scent and taste might be too much for some people. However, it is tolerable and that&#x27;s why it is an attractive feature for the others. I think if I keep using it, I&#x27;ll be adapted soon. I honestly don&#x27;t know if it lasts long because I just wash my mouth often or don&#x27;t check myself in mirror. I can tell you that I didn&#x27;t feel the dried lips after I put on this. But again..that&#x27;s the function of a normal lip balm. Maybe I give a high rate because others gave the high rates. Maybe it&#x27;s a psychological factor. Try it yourself. All I can say is that I didn&#x27;t have any negative result after I used this.</li>
    <li> I love this chapstick.  It&#x27;s  mint flavor feels so good on the lips.</li>
    <li> Smells great and softens lips well. No more chapstick for this girl.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product; much better than other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; balms, as my lips stay moisturized all day. It doesn&#x27;t hurt that the peppermint also, feels and smells great :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve researched so many different lip balms, I could practically tell you everything there is to know about every brand. I finally found a really amazing one! This lip balm is light on your lips, not sticky or slimy, and healed my dry skin. I love the taste of the peppermint and how refreshing it is. Especially during those dry, cold winter months. You won&#x27;t regret buying this lip balm. I&#x27;ve given one to my husband, mom and mother in law too! They love it too!</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s all natural..so many toxins in makeup today..I put this on every night so my lips are ready in the morning for the perfect lipstick application :) thank you for coming out with such a lovely, natural product!</li>
    <li> My wife loved the product - better than any she&#x27;s tried so far. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Have been using this balm for just a couple of weeks. While it definitely seems to be helping I&#x27;m reserving the 5-Star rating for a few more weeks. I&#x27;ve tried what seems like every lip balm product under the sun to heal constantly dry, peeling lips. None were ever effective....lips might feel OK while the product was on my lips but once it wore off, my lips were still dry and cracked. Seems the past few days since using Beauty by Earth lip balm, my lips are less dry and the peeling is virtually gone. The upcoming cold months will tell the tale.</li>
    <li> This was a great find! Superb quality lip balm that smells and tastes great! It comes in a pack of four. Goes on smooth, not waxy at all. Love it!</li>
    <li> Nice. I guess the positive reviews  speaks well of this products</li>
    <li> This argan oil is awesome.  I use it on my face and my body then apply lotion. The price for this 4 oz. bottle plus the beeswax lip care is wonderful. The lip balm is also very good.  Will be buying from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I just got my lip balm and immediately put it on and I LOVE it. Helped immediately with dry lips and smells great! Highly recommend! It&#x27;s very pepperminty and cooling when you put it on which I love! Thanks for a great product! :)</li>
    <li> Very good lip balm! A bit waxy, so not much comes off in each application, but it works very well and is a great deal. I keep one in the bathroom, one in my purse and one by my bed (I have VERY chapped lips). And best of all, cruelty free!</li>
    <li> Amazing lip balm. Peppermint is extremely strong and will over power anything you eat or drink after applying it recently. Moisturizes lips very well and one application last most of the day.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  It&#x27;s very similar to the Burt&#x27;s Bees mint lip balm, however I now like this one better!  It adequately moisturizes and smells awesome.  I also really appreciate the natural ingredients, as most lip balms either contain or smell/taste like chemicals!</li>
    <li> So I was an avid BeesWax brand fan. I went on my honeymoon and found this lip balm by the brand Aphrodite (same brand as my shampoo and conditioner I ordered here). I couldn&#x27;t find the Aphrodite balm here on Amazon but I did find this. This Beauty by Earth is even better than that! I love it!!! It&#x27;s a bit pricey but worth every penny. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Best balm I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> The reviews are true. This lip balm is great and worth the price. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different chapsticks, even just plain Vaseline - they don&#x27;t even compare. During the winter season my lips get chapped a lot, but not with this chapstick. Go on ahead and buy it, you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
    <li> Whole family uses this now and can&#x27;t imagine going anywhere without it.  Finally a better solution for lip care that&#x27;s safe and effective.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lip balm!! It is very soft and moisturizing. It has a deIicious, sweet, mint taste and keeps my lips soft for hours (even overnight!) I will definitely be ordering more as I have given a couple away.</li>
    <li> Nice to find toxin free products.  Performs much the same as any lip balm ... temporary relief for dry lips.  Nice flavors. Doesn&#x27;t last any longer than any other lip balms that I have used.  Nice packaging.</li>
    <li> I admit I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; when I was ordering and was disappointed when the lip balm arrived and it was peppermint.  Oh, well, I&#x27;m addicted to lip balm, so I used it anyway.  Uh, this stuff is great!  I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference in the amount of chapping and dry lips I&#x27;ve been dealing with.  I&#x27;m not sure what makes it so special, but I&#x27;m sold.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Definitely more gentle of a peppermint flavor than Burt&#x27;s Bees. Just as addictive as any other lip balm. I was looking for something I wouldn&#x27;t have to apply as often. I don&#x27;t think the price ($11 for 4 tubes) is justified, because I didn&#x27;t perceive any noteworthy benefits after a couple weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Great lip balm that makes my lips feel moisturized! Love that this product is all natural!</li>
    <li> Really great lip balm.  I love the peppermint.</li>
    <li> My lips are always dry. I always keep trying new products, but most of them aren&#x27;t good. This lip palm is really good. I felt the difference from the first day.</li>
    <li> This is great lip balm.  It has a very pleasant mint flavor and a nice consistency/texture on the lips.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> feels good on lips but not as big as picture looks.</li>
    <li> Very good stuff. Does what it says.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Similar to Burts Bees original, but slightly stronger peppermint taste and super moisturizing.</li>
    <li> One of the best lip balms I&#x27;ve tried.  Very moisturizing, and nice gentle flavor.  Helps chapped lips to heal, and helps prevent chapped lips.</li>
    <li> good s*** this lipbalm</li>
    <li> Love the way the balm makes my lips feel.</li>
    <li> I like the peppermint smell just wish it lingered a little longer after putting on hence the lost of a star. Does make your lips soft</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many lip balms, and this is by far the best one that I have ever used. Most of the other lip balms that I&#x27;ve used provide temporary relief, but they make my lips even more chapped after it wears off. The Beauty by Earth lip balm has no adverse effects. I am so glad that I found it and can&#x27;t imagine a winter without it.</li>
    <li> Love the cool peppermint feeling after application. Very refreshing and well recommended.</li>
    <li> Love it. So smooth &amp; doesn&#x27;t make your lips addicted &amp; dry. The peppermint leaves the most refreshing tingle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been slowly making the move to products that don&#x27;t have the un-necessary chemicals and artificial scents in them. I will be placing another order soon.  My whole family has nothing but good things so say about the lip balm.  It lasts longer than other brands before needing another application, and the peppermint provides a soothing tingle on my lips as well.  My youngest son said it healed his lips and it tastes good too!</li>
    <li> I have only had the lip baum for a week but it seems to be just as advertised. It feels good going on and tastes great. I work out doors for most of the day and need to keep my lips protected. This seems to do the trick.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Great price, works wonderful.  I had dry cracked lips due to Chicago winters and after 3 days of use, they are nearly back to normal.  Great product, will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> Great product. All natural. Its light and peppermint flavor feels wonderful. Unlike other lip balms, you don&#x27;t need to apply every hours. 3 or 4 times a day is good for me. I have very dry lips and purchased this product after searching a lot. I am glad I got it. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff with really good ingredients.  Well made, nicely packaged, good staying power and a light minty tingle, which I love. I am obsessed with lip balms, so I consider myself somewhat of an expert.  Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have tried many different chapsticks/lip balms and they only temporarily work as in every 10 min. Beauty by earth last a long time between uses, is a good price, shipped quickly, tastes good, and deeply moisturizers your lips! If your lips our cracked and dry this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a box of the 4 lip balms to give as stocking stuffers for my daughter, daughter-in-law, and a friend at work....however, after using one, I decided to keep them all for myself!  I put them next to by bed in the night stand, one in the living room next to my &#x27;chair&#x27;, one in my purse, and one in the bathroom!  NOW I need to order another box or two to give as gifts!  I love this product!  Not heavy or too greasy, and smells wonderful!  It really makes my lips smooth and feel better!</li>
    <li> My lips are so soft and the smell is subtle. Love it</li>
    <li> This is the best chapstick I&#x27;ve ever used! My lips stay moisturized and soft. Only one I&#x27;ll use from now on!</li>
    <li> I have tried just about every type of chapstick or lip balm you can imagine. On other top brands, I found myself having to frequently reapply the chapstick throughout the day. I took a chance on Beauty by Earth. I have never heard of the brand name before or knew much about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchasing this product was the best choice I have made. Not only am I only applying my chapstick once a day, I am noticing that my lips are much more healthy. I will NEVER buy anything but Beauty by Earth lip balm. I highly recommend you try it if you are on the fence about buying it like I was.</li>
    <li> great product....did a lot of research and bought this....very happy and will reorder...</li>
    <li> refreshing allergen free, great products.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product previously. They continue to make a high quality product with no artificIal smell or flavoring and it is great lip balm! I am also impressed with a small company that takes the time to contact customers when their product is purchased. Would not hesitate to recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Similar to Burt&#x27;s Bees, but better. Finally a lip balm with good ingredients. No soy or canola oil (unlike Burt&#x27;s Bees). My lips seem to get chapped more than most people so I still have to apply it somewhat often, but it is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried and it will now be my new go to. Natural ingredients and it does it&#x27;s job, why isn&#x27;t this the standard for all such companies? Beauty by Earth has stepped up to the plate and has set the bar. Thank you!</li>
    <li> So far I like the product.</li>
    <li> Glad to use natural lip balm products. This lip balm is very easily to be applied and not like other products which feel too thick or heavy on your lips. I like the scent and the balm itself tastes like honey.</li>
    <li> I think this is probably the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used. I am prone to cracked, dry lips. Since using this product, my lips have not bled or peeled and have stayed smooth. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I tend to lick my lips while concentrating, so they get dry and chapped a lot.  I don&#x27;t like many of the commercial products available - and had found a brand that was sourced semi-locally - but the only place to buy it is 45 minutes from my house - not exactly worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Randomly searching Amazon, I came across this product and ordered it.  It is exactly as promised - natural, so you don&#x27;t get that nasty plastic feeling from other commercial brands.  Additionally, the peppermint taste isn&#x27;t overpowering - more subtle...perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is, I left it in my car, and I don&#x27;t want to walk all the way to the parking garage to get it!  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Smooth, lasting and beneficial lip balm...new favorite!!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my wife who is pretty picky about her lip balms. When she put it on she said &amp;#34;oooh&amp;#34;, which I think is a good thing. Some peppermint balms can apparently be harsh. This seems like a quality product with a good balance of quality ingredients.</li>
    <li> I am picky about lip balm, needing to avoid harsh chemicals and so far this causes me no problems.  With some lip balms I feel that they actually make my  lips MORE dry after it wears off.  Sounds weird but true.  Somehow I can then become dependent on the lip balm.  BUT this kind does not seem to be causing that problem.  The weather just warmed up to just above freezing, so I won&#x27;t really be able to put it to the test until January, but so far so good.  I appreciate this all-natural approach at a very reasonable price!  Very minty, so if you like that flavor you will like this.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable that these are getting stellar reviews! Very gritty, hard, and dry...does NOT moisturize, feel smooth, buttery, nor luxurious on your lips in the least. &amp;#34;Mongo Kiss&amp;#34;(sold at Whole Foods Market) in peppermint is certified organic, provides unsurpassed moisture that lasts, and feels absolutely amazing on the lips! I will never veer from the peppermint &amp;#34;Mongo Kiss&amp;#34; lip balm again!</li>
    <li> I am pleasantly surprised at this product.  My lips are extremely dry and chapped, and this really soothes.  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds, cheap and &amp;#34;very expensive&amp;#34;, and this one is one of the top quality.  It glides on very smoothly on my dried and chapped lips, and leaves with refreshing minty and cool feeling and it soothes.  It does not last after I drink or eat food, but none of other products does anyway.  Great price for the quality.  Easy to carry around as well.  I also use it underneath lip glosses.</li>
    <li> Incredible! I&#x27;ve been trying every chapstick out there and couldn&#x27;t find one that actually worked.  I received this as a gift YESTERDAY, tried it that evening, applied before bed, woke up the NEXT DAY with no chapped lips anymore!  It worked overnight! Amazing, never going back to anything else! Love love love! :)</li>
    <li> I like these lip balms... all flavors are good, but I wish they weren&#x27;t so sweet.</li>
    <li> Excellent transaction! This is a great lip balm at a good price. Very smooth, and moisturizing!</li>
    <li> Excellent taste (for some odd reason); it literally tastes like peppermint all over your mouth. I purposely want to put it on someone else to make out with so I can taste it. I love how the actual balm doesnt get mushy and fall apart and seep out from the cap when it&#x27;s stored...that&#x27;s my biggest issue with specialty lip balms. It is relatively stable and I love that. It definitely does keep my lips moisturized. I&#x27;m on accutane so I need good quality lip balm and this does the trick. It is also a good value which is AMAZING.</li>
    <li> this stuff is great. it also helps break the addiction of normal lip balm because they keep ur lips moisturized longer.  great product</li>
    <li> Really like this but for bedtime use not the best so good smelling you like to lick your lips</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent, goes on smooth. Perfect to help with dry lips due to congestion.</li>
    <li> The best I have ever tried. All pure ingredients no junk.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this lip balm. The peppermint was not overbearing. It has a nice sweet minty taste.</li>
    <li> Good for the price.  Love it</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. Love the tingling sensation that the peppermint provides. A true relief to dry lips!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this peppermint lip balm! The smell is amazing of course and the fact that it&#x27;s 100% natural, free of GMO&#x27;s, cruelty free and earth friendly makes me love this product even more!! My lips tend to get chapped all throughout the year, not just winter &amp; I know when I&#x27;m using this lip balm my lips will always feel soft and refreshed! Love love LOVE!</li>
    <li> Great lip balm! When you put it on your lips you can taste the peppermint. I could possibly eat it!!</li>
    <li> This is literally the best chapstick I have ever used!! I was having an issue with my lips constantly peeling even after trying every solution I could think of! Even after trying burt&#x27;s bees it did not help. This chapstick is the only thing that solved my problem! It goes on super smooth &amp; you do not need a lot to at all to feel its moisture. It hydrates for a long time &amp; now my lips are back to normal I love it!! Also for the price it is such a good deal compared to $4 per chap for other brands like burt&#x27;s bees. I will forever be a customer of beauty by earth!</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm!! It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> Very nice product and will reorder</li>
    <li> My new favorite lip balm! I initially bought this set to give as gifts but I can already see I&#x27;ll be keeping these!</li>
    <li> The lip balm is very different from all of the other ones I&#x27;ve tried.  Seems to moisturize all day and is not waxy feeling at all.  Very pleased with it so far, thank you.</li>
    <li> I guess I am used to more of a shea butter type chapstick that was a good moisturizer. This just does not compare to that. It just sits on top of your lips, it doesn&#x27;t moisturize.</li>
    <li> I have used lip balm for years but - until Beauty by Earth lip balm - had not found a brand that I really loved and would continue to buy.  Living in a dry desert climate makes lip balm a necessity.  Well, I LOVE the Peppermint lip care balm.  It&#x27;s very emollient, applies smoothly, actually penetrates to soften, hydrate and nourish - does not just coat the lips as do most balms I have used.  It has good staying power and the peppermint is yummy.  The four pack is convenient for keeping a tube at my desk and around the house.  Highly recommend!  (Step aside, Burt&#x27;s Bees - Beauty by Earth Balm has come to town.)</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing.  What everyone else said about it lasting a while and tasting good are all accurate.  It&#x27;s a great product I will be ordering again and again.</li>
    <li> Works well, as it should.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I works pretty good.. I am undecided about the peppermint part, it makes you tingle.  I like the natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> Best lip balm!  Lasts for a long time and goes on really smooth.  Great scent!</li>
    <li> Best lip balm on the market!</li>
    <li> Excellent Peppermint flavor and moisture lasted.</li>
    <li> My lips were going through a horribly dry bout for the past month, and nothing seemed to fix it. This Chapstick cleared me up in just a couple of days. I will be a repeat costomer!</li>
    <li> Goes on clumpy and the small/taste is good but almost not there at all</li>
    <li> Loooove this lip balm! It so fresh and smooth on my lips, I love the smell of peppermint and best of all it keeps my lips soft and beautiful!</li>
    <li> This is better than all the other products out there. The dry weather has been really bad for my lips and nothing was helping at all. I really like these lip balms. They are not sticky or greasy and the peppermint flavor is amazing. I highly recommend this product to anyone suffering from dry and chapped lips.</li>
    <li> Went out on a limb here based on former reviews and impressed.  This balm seems to moisturize well without drying out the lips later, and lasts quite a while.  Worked great in NYC winter so far.  Peppermint flavor also gives the lips a nice tingly feeling, as well as aroma.  Price seems very reasonable for a higher end product, which I would definitely say it is.  I think that the beeswax combined with the vitamin E is a a much better balm than the cheap chapstick stuff.</li>
    <li> Awesome beeswax lip balm in the market.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found my new go to lip balm. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> THE best lip balm I have ever used!!! LOVE it!! highly recommend!!!!!</li>
    <li> Stays put on my lips well without drying out and needing to reapply.</li>
    <li> Love it. Your lips will taste like candy cane. I think it takes at least 3-4 hours before you even consider reapplying, and reapplying is something I actually look forward to because of the candy cane taste.</li>
    <li> Seems to work quite well and i really like the flavor !</li>
    <li> I have tried many lip balms over the years, and for the quality and taste, and not to mention the softness one has for their lips, this is the best lip balm I have ever had in many years.</li>
    <li> Nice peppermint aroma, but balm texture was grainy and the little nob that makes the tube increase or decrease does not work (on the first tube I pulled out and used)</li>
    <li> Very effective product. I&#x27;ve only had to apply it once or twice a day to keep my lips soft.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality lip balm. Love the peppermint. Nice ingredients. Not sticky. Smooths my lips and prevents chapping. 4 pack is great for having one everywhere car purse gym bag etc. Great price for them  will buy again</li>
    <li> I tried all different flavors that this company carries and ALL of them are good!!  Each boxes has 4 lip balm inside.  I like to keep on my desk, in my bag, in the car or inside the drawer of my bedside.  I am glad that I could try this products and especially you can get on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Better than burts bee and carmex</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how this would work out for me, but based on the reviews I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by the quality of this product. I use it once in the morning and once at night only but the lips stay smooth and soft through out. Most likely I&#x27;ll be repeat buyer.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is amazing.  Truly.  For the first time I realized later in the day that my lips didn&#x27;t feel dry and constantly need to have balm reapplied!  I will never use another brand again!!</li>
    <li> Love that&#x27;s it&#x27;s made from natural inredients.</li>
    <li> I love that this is all natural. The peppermint adds just enough tingle to my lips, and it tastes really good! Provides excellent protection, been a great product for our cold winter.</li>
    <li> I have chronically dry lips, and have been looking for seriously decades for an effective lip balm.  After just a week of use, I already notice a difference.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> I really like this lip balm.  I had used Burt&#x27;s Bees for MANY years but have felt that the quality has suffered of the years.  I tried this on a whim and I love it.  I does a great job moisturizing and has a great minty taste.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just ok for me. Not the feel of moisture I was looking for. I&#x27;ll keep around in case of emergencies but will not be my go to lip moisturizer. I will be trying something different.</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my lips!</li>
    <li> This chapstick is way better than the one I get from Wholefoods! With the weather so dry, my lips have been very chapped. I love the way this one feels  very natural. It smells great too. I am not a fan of lip stick or gloss and I can&#x27;t tolerate many brands of chapstick but I love this one and my lips are healing well.</li>
    <li> Great chapstick. My brand of choice.</li>
    <li> Not great, not horrible, just okay. I think I like my Burt&#x27;s Bees Vanilla Bean better. But since it came in a multi-pack, I stuck a lip balm in every room so there&#x27;s always one handy.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product that really does the job. Love it will order again.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm I have ever used. I have very dry lips and most balms I have used just puts a waxy coating on my lips and moisturizer at all.  This leaves my lips moist and has really helped the dryness.  It has a cool minty feel and taste. I really love it.  I have just ordered it again.</li>
    <li> Nice peppermint flavor that is not overwhelming, and nice feel of protection. The vendor delivered as promised.</li>
    <li> Smells more like spearmint than peppermint.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been making a concerted effort to replace &amp;#34;conventional&amp;#34; products with more natural ones over the last few years.  I&#x27;m especially concerned about products that might make their way into my children&#x27;s mouths, e.g. chapstick.  I decided to give this lip balm a try, putting one stick in each family member&#x27;s christmas stocking.  I must say that everyone loves it!  There is a very pleasant tingling, and I don&#x27;t find the peppermint flavor to be overwhelming (disclaimer - I love all things mint!).  I was surprised at how long the product stayed on my lips and kept them feeling moist and soft.  We live in a semi-desert climate, so we often have issues with dry skin and lips.  I&#x27;m pleased to say that I have now found the more natural alternative to chapstick.  I definitely plan to continue purchasing products from this company.  I would highly recommend (and you can&#x27;t even tell that it&#x27;s a natural substitute - I think it works better than the regular stuff!).</li>
    <li> My lips got addicted to using carmex that if i didn&#x27;t apply it often it felt like my lips were on fire. I tried other products to move away from carmex and all still left me applying a lot to prevent the burning feeling on my lips. This is the lip balm that truly worked and really moisturized my lips!! The only thing I will use now as a lip balm.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with several others on here in stating I feel there are a lot of fake reviews regarding this stuff.  Especially after seeing the number of 5 star reviews that were posted around nearly the same time.  I suspect the owners probably posted a \\&quot;Hey, like my product!\\&quot; Facebook blast out to all of their friends without any of them actually trying it.  This stuff is horrible.  It&#x27;s too sweet and doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  If you took some peppermint Altoids, crushed and mixed them into some form of a paste, and smeared it on your lips you&#x27;d essentially have the same thing. That&#x27;s how sweet it is.  I mean, yeah it tastes good but what good is a product you can&#x27;t keep on your lips because you keep licking it off.  I too experienced a burning sensation several other reviewers complained about after only a few minutes use.  Six friends of mine tried this only to hate it as much as me.  I couldn&#x27;t even pawn the stuff off so it ultimately ended up in the garbage.</li>
    <li> My lips have been less chapped since using Beauty By Earth lip balm. I love it and I feel I use it less  often then the other lip balms, do to it working so well</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I have struggled with my lips for several years.  I didn&#x27;t really start having issues with them until my sophomore or junior year in high school, but since that time, problems have come in full force.  It started out as a severe dryness. Whenever I would get nervous, like in front of crowds, my lips would slowly shrink and lose all of their moisture in an instant, rendering my speech unusable.  My mouth would instantly become a desert and I would have no relief, and even water was only a temporary relief for a few minutes.  As time progressed, I started getting additional issues: cracked lips, random splitting, peeling, and just over a few months ago, heating lips.  It came to the point that my mouth was one of the most frustrating parts of my entire body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a response to this, I have used many products over my lifetime to try and remedy these issues, namely Carmex, several lotions, and even cocoa butter Vaseline.  All of these products helped for a little bit, but even through that moisture, I still would encounter the same problems.  And my experience became very frustrating about a month ago and I just couldn&#x27;t take it anymore, since this issue was almost messing with my everyday speech at my job.  Ultimately, I did some research and I came across several lip balms (like Burt&#x27;s Bees) to try and help me, but I saw that the petroleum and other non-organic additives were the items that were hurting me.  But I came across this lip balm by \\&quot;Beauty by Earth\\&quot; and saw all the positive reviews, feedback, and the all-natural ingredients used, so I had to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I got it, but I swear to you, the first time I pressed this against my lips, it was like a blizzard traveled across my lips.  It was unbelievable how cool my lips felt after my first use.  All of the heat and irritation completely went away and my lips felt refreshed.  Since that first experience, I have been using the lip balm for a little over a month and there has been no more lip splitting, no more cracking, no more excessive heat, and the peeling has been drastically reduced.

    <li> I wonder if they&#x27;re edible. Because the taste and smell is just too good on my lips.... It moisturizes my lips well. Love it.</li>
    <li> THIS MADE MY LIPS DRYER..IT TASTES DELICIOUS..THATS IT :(</li>
    <li> Nice and minty! Works great. I don&#x27;t feel it lasts quite as long as a blistex does but I love knowing there&#x27;s nothing artificial and all the good oils in this. Quality product for a fair price. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best choice for keeping your lips unchapped. I used to use chapstick but they kept making my lips drier. Vaseline was good but you could always see it on. You can really tell a difference between this and chapstick. Great Product!</li>
    <li> These moisturize very well and I love that it&#x27;s all natural so unlike most lip balms you don&#x27;t accidentally taste or ingest any nasty chemicals through normal use.  The peppermint is relatively strong at first - I thought it would be too strong but apparently I&#x27;ve gotten used to it.  And this doesn&#x27;t leave my lips dry and flaky when it wears off like a lot of other balms seem to do.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.  This is the best lip-balm I have ever used.  I used to buy Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s, but it can not compare with the Beauty by Earth lip balm.  The Beauty by Earth lip balm is smooth and refreshing.  I love how it feels going on.  And the fact that it&#x27;s all natural is a great bonus!!  I will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> Keeps lips hydrated for much longer than store bought Chapstick. I love that it&#x27;s all natural and does not have any parabens, silicones, or other harsh chemicals. Definitely going to be buying this stuff for life.</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm!  I wanted to try a more natural product without parabens or petroleum. I&#x27;ve used Burt&#x27;s bees for sometime and prefer this formula.  The peppermint flavor taste like a peppermint candy and it just glides on! Will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> Totally refreshing and moisturizing balm.  My daughter and 2 granddaughters snapped up 3 of them real quick after they tried mine.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have used lip balm for years and this is by far my favorite. My whole family uses this. I recommend this for sure!</li>
    <li> Grainy texture,  but does moisturize</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It goes on smooth and lasts along time. It doesn&#x27;t make you lips sticky and it had a light minty taste. I&#x27;m ordering again to make sure I always have one on hand.</li>
    <li> love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural and feels great on the lips however cannot give 5 stars because it is too sweet for my liking...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with dry, peeling, gross-looking lips for as long as I can remember. I&#x27;ve literally tried just about every chapstick or lip balm out there. And not one has even come close to helping. It has been so frustrating because I was always conscious about how badly my lips appeared. Well last week I decided to try yet again, another lip balm! But luckily for me I came across this miracle product. I saw the 5 star rating and for the price I figured it was worth a shot. I was not expecting this to work nearly as well as it has. In the matter of 1 day my lips went from dry, and peeling, to soft and smooth! I almost didn&#x27;t believe it. Every other product I had used wouldn&#x27;t last, and the dead skin would inevitably build up and start to peel off. But with this, I&#x27;ve had almost none of that at all! I even compared the ingredients on this to Burts Bees, which everyone raves about. Now the ingredients are mostly the same, but even that didn&#x27;t help me. This stuff is a miracle. It&#x27;s seriously such a relief and I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product! Dont even consider buying another lip balm, just buy this, it is the absolute best!</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY! Unless you like hard to spread li balm! Even after warming in my hand still hard! Does not penetrate lips to moisten it just sits on top! and if you do get it on when you go outside in cold your lips will turn white due to all the wax hardening up! I think there is too much wax in this product and thats the problem! Save yourself the trouble i went back to burts bees goes on smooth and penetrates!</li>
    <li> This lip balm is exactly as advertised and, unlike most lip balms, doesn&#x27;t make my lips peel after several hours of wearing it. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> It has worked well.  My lips were stayed chapped and dry so, they were becoming very dark to where people would ask me if I smoked :-? .  I decided to try this and now my lips are less chapped pink again :).  From time to time, I can go an entire day without applying more too.</li>
    <li> I will never use regular chapstick again. My lips had become so chapped that they burned all the time. Putting chapstick on didn&#x27;t help at all and probably made my lips worse. Within three days of using the beauty by earth lip balm they healed. I love it and will never go back to using that chemical stick!!</li>
    <li> Nothing special, cheaper to buy a .99 cent blistex chap stick than buying all these.</li>
    <li> I love these lip balms, this is my second time purchasing them and I will buy again.  These go on silky smooth and have an awesome peppermint smell and feel but are not sweet.  I do not like sweet lip balms at all so these are perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  My 3rd purchase and unfortunately they must have changed the formulation because they no longer have the zingy peppermint feel and they now have a sweetness.  Luckily I found out that the original Burts Bees is a peppermint (not as strong as this one was) but they have no added sweetness.  My daughter who is not as picky as me was happy to have these but I won&#x27;t be ordering again.  Sorry.</li>
    <li> Best lip balm ever! Probably because it has natural beeswax. It;s so pure and really moisturizes well. A glide will keep my puckers moisturized for a whole day. No, seriously. Then I apply again before I go to bed. My lips have never been this moisturized!!!</li>
    <li> I like it so much ~ it give you feel of soft and fresh bec the mint .</li>
    <li> The peppermint smell in this, is outstanding. It&#x27;s a huge plus for someone with allergies! It also goes on rather smoothly, and works perfectly to keep the lips moist. It&#x27;s just a wonderful item, I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  This is my second time ordering it.  I love the coolness of the peppermint. Stays on longer than others. I was online searching for a good lip balm and  was reading reviews also. A woman commented on this product. She explained about how it stays on your lips for a good length of time.  I started searching for it on  Amazon.  I found it.  Read all about it.  I ordered it and now I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> This is great lip balm!!  My lips feel so tender and not chapped.  I am so glad I found this product because I need to use a lip balm constantly all day.  I really like storing a lip balm in my desk so I can just reach in and apply anytime of the day.  I love how my lips are smooth and not flakey.  I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I would definitely rate this as the best lip balm I have ever used. I have tried many over the years. There are two other balms that I like but they just don&#x27;t match this product. Trader Joes makes a very emollient Spearmint lip balm. It rates high on penetrating the lips but it just doesn&#x27;t stay on the lips long enough. The other product is Burt Bees Peppermint Lip balm which has great staying power &amp; penetrates the lip well but its not very emollient. The Beauty by Earth product is strong in all categories. I just love it!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is great and feels very smooth! Service of the company is also very good. Would definitely continue to purchase more items!</li>
    <li> I have had chapped lips and have used chapstick products as long as I can remember all year round.  I&#x27;ve been looking for something different that would heal better and have less chemicals.  I&#x27;m trying to go organic as much as possible.  I came across this product and I liked the ingredient list.  It&#x27;s all natural.  It applies nicely on my lips and has a minty taste to eat.  It&#x27;s soothing and I don&#x27;t need to apply it as often as other products I&#x27;ve used.  I really like this product.  It came in a pack of 4 so I&#x27;ve put them in several places so I&amp;#34;m never without!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!  It&#x27;s silky, light, and the mint is refreshing.  I have found my new favorite lip balm!</li>
    <li> I recommend this lip balm. The peppermint smells great and the product does help smooth your dry lips.</li>
    <li> I love chapstick and I really use so much of it that I&#x27;ve been trying to buy more natural products. So far I love this! I felt it go on smooth and lovely when I first put it on, a little slick until my lips soaked it all up. There&#x27;s a delightful minty tingle after. Same size as most chapsticks, cute packaging and smells great!</li>
    <li> I truly wish I can give this a negative tretrigintillion stars. Used once, and it totally destroys my lips. I am talking about bleeding and torn apart here. I do not know what causes this, but be careful of whatever they put it there. The end.</li>
    <li> I was able to snag some of these and love them! Taste just like Peppermint.</li>
    <li> Wanted to love this, because all the ingredients appear to be exactly what you would want in a lip balm.  Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t found it to be moisturizing.  My lips actually feel a bit dried out after using it. I know menthol can have that effect, and though it&#x27;s not on the ingredient list, maybe peppermint works similarly?  It also tingles quite a bit, though I don&#x27;t necessarily mind that part.  Sadly, would not repurchase, and will probably try to give away the tubes I haven&#x27;t used.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a lip balm that didn&#x27;t have a lot of junk in it, and I could only find it online. I&#x27;ve been using this during the day and at night as a conditioning treatment. I&#x27;m very happy with it. My lips look and feel great!</li>
    <li> Love these! They smell great, are very tasty and hydrating. Tastes like I just sucked on a candy cane! I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> I purchased this a few months ago to try to replace a drug store brand Burt&#x27;s Bees knockoff that I preferred over the name brand because it didn&#x27;t melt in my pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feel of this lip balm is nice, but it leaves my lips tasting strangely sweet for a surprisingly long time after application, which I find very unpleasant. It also doesn&#x27;t really smell like peppermint even though I bought the peppermint scent.</li>
    <li> Best chapstick in the whole world, you will not regret this purchase!</li>
    <li> This is by far the WORSE product I have ever encountered! First time using it, my lips swelled to Kylie Jenner proportions, and then started itching. Two days later, they began peeling, and cracking... now I have bleeding cracked lips! Did I mention this product made my lips feel nastier than Madonna&#x27;s kisses?  I have no clue what &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; ingredient this has in it that has destroyed my lips, but I will NEVER use this again! I am going back to Burt&#x27;s Bees, at least I know their ingredients don&#x27;t cause this kind of problem, and they are so much cheaper.</li>
    <li> Made lips more dry and was greasy feeling. Disnt stay on lips.</li>
    <li> Gritty, gritty and gritty. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm that I&#x27;ve ever tried !  Thanks a lot !</li>
    <li> This is by far the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like waxy feeling lip balms, and this one is not.  It goes on smoothly, and has a hint of peppermint flavoring.  My perpetually chapped lips really feel better.  I like that it is not a petroleum product, too.</li>
    <li> Goes on soft and love the slight peppermint. Tastes great too!</li>
    <li> Bought for my kids teachers for valentines day. I kept one, and love it. Don&#x27;t have to use it as much throughout the day like my usual chapstick. Just once in the morning and once before bed. Great results.</li>
    <li> I have always been a chapstick kind of guy. I actually even used that over Burt&#x27;s bees or Carmex or Vaseline. The only thing I ever used that I liked more before this was aquafor but that was not something I would want to carry around with me. Beauty by Earth has them all beat. It makes your lips so soft and lasts all day and it tastes great. Def my new favorite.</li>
    <li> Nice flavor and soft lips.</li>
    <li> This IS the best lip balm  have ever used.  Since I have false teeth, I have been having problems with my lips.  Unless I wore my dentures 24/7 my lips would hurt and feel terrible.  No chap stick would work ... until Beauty by Earth.  With all the tubes of lip balm all around the house that didn&#x27;t work, this was worth the try.&lt;br /&gt;I have not been this happy about a product in along time.  I would suggest this product to everyone to try.  The best part is it is all natural.  That goes along with my husband&#x27;s and I life and we love that!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Beauty!</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite lip balm of all time. It works quickly and great. I have one in my car, my purse my diaper bag and another one in my purse in case of emergency. ;) Highly, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This has a light peppermint scent. It does not make your lips tingle like some peppermint infused lip balms. I previously bought the non-scented version, and I love the same things about the peppermint scented ones.  It glides smoothly on your lips. It is not as hard, rough, or grainy as the Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms. It also lasts a couple of hours on my lips before I need to re-apply.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, super soft, makes my lips feel refreshed! I love them!</li>
    <li> I used to like Blue Aveeno the best, Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s second. Now I like this product better than both. I want to try the flavoured ones, but don&#x27;t want the variety pack... Oh well</li>
    <li> it is really good and same as the common with plentiful good reviews. it is not easily broken and it seems natural and its humidity is good.i love it and will order again.</li>
    <li> Got these as a gift and love them. Its been years since finding something that doesn&#x27;t get greasy on my lips and face. This is exactly that and the right texture for healing my chapped lips.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this lip balm for about a week now and I really like it. I only have to apply it once a day and my lips stay moist. I will be purchasing this lip balm from now on!</li>
    <li> My son is on accutane treatment for acne, and has really dry skin and lips.  He really likes this chapstick because of it&#x27;s thick consistency that stays on for a long time.  The peppermint is also nice.</li>
    <li> I got this in an exchange for my review &amp; let me tell you how presently surprised I was. Growing up I was a Blistex and Softlips wearer. As I grew into my twenties I started looking into the ingredients that I was putting into and onto my body. I ditched the crap and started searching for more natural routes. Obviously, I came across Burt&#x27;s Bees and was loyal until they sold out to Clorox. Yup. Not going back there. So I went local. &amp; I&#x27;ve been doing so ever since... Until, I got this offer. Sure, I said, hopes not that high. The package came &amp; there were 4 sticks of peppermint lip balm. I was like man, it&#x27;s going to take me forever to go through these, already naming off friends I could pawn them off to. I tried it out. It went on smooth. It smelled good. It felt good. It tasted good. Not the I&#x27;m gonna put it on just to taste it (which defeats the purpose if lip balm), but pleasant. My lips were slightly chapped at the time &amp; my toddler boy was getting a chapped upper lip. Both were gone within 2 to 3 days &amp; I only applied this balm a handful of times. I&#x27;m sold. I love this stuff. Got one on my purse, in my make up bag and one in my living room, in arms reach... One unopened for backup... Or I may hand it out to a deserving friend to hook them, too. I&#x27;ll be back, Beauty By Earth, with money in hand.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;d love to try the Konjac Facial Sponge!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t hydrate as well as other lip balms(Burts bees) and didn&#x27;t stay on as well. Too thin and greasy.</li>
    <li> My gripe with most natural lip balms is they are hard, and constantly found myself having to re-apply every 15 mins. Most peppermint scented ones tend to be harsh or sting when using.  Not the case with Beauty by Earth. I&#x27;ve been rather obsessed with this balm since breaking it out of the package. I can&#x27;t wait until they run out so I can check out their additional scents. I highly recommend this lip balm.</li>
    <li> Having been a burts bees addict for years, I tried this and can&#x27;t go back to using my burts. It&#x27;s so much more silky and smooth on the lips, presumably from the oils being main ingredients. Repairs chapped lips in less time than my $25 Sugar lip balms. Also it&#x27;s all natural! Can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> when it goes on my lips it feel silky and it makes my lips feel good</li>
    <li> Perfect. They leave your lips with enough moisture but not oily.</li>
    <li> Feels peppermint, I like it. 👍</li>
    <li> Wonderful product at an affordable price!  We are really enjoying it and will definitely be ordering more.</li>
    <li> A wonderful cruelty-free product! Love the scent</li>
    <li> This product came in a very nice quality, small box shown in the product photo, just big enough to hold four lip balms. They come in standard chapstick tubes and the packaging is all very nice.&lt;br /&gt;On application, it has a cooling effect from the peppermint oil, which I liked and was what I was looking for. It applies on easily and isn&#x27;t so thick that applications cannot be layered. I found it more hydrating than the mint EOS lip balm, which I had been using before this product. The EOS was so thick that the amount that could be applied was too little to be effective, whereas the Beauty by Earth lip balm is thin enough for multiple applications to result in a thicker coverage for highly chapped lips. Overall, more effective than an EOS lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;Love the packaging, love the ingredients, love the product.</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm! I am obsessed and use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Does not last on your lips.</li>
    <li> I really like it, it  has a very light feeling and  last a long time and it works very well. it&#x27;s cold where I live and it&#x27;s great when your outside in the wind I got the 4 pack and have shared with my daughters as well as they really like it too. I will be reordering</li>
    <li> I like this lip balm. It makes my lip smooth.</li>
    <li> I had been using Burts Bees and Whole Foods brand lip balm for awhile and while it did help temporarily moisturize my lips, they would eventually feel chapped again and it even felt like they were getting worse eventually. It was a mess. They only offered tempory relief and then my lips felt dry and chapped, worse than before. I finally decided I needed to find something else that not only moisturized my lips but also helped them heal from the peeling of the dryness the other lip balms induced on my lips. I went on amazon and I wanted to find a good product at a reasonable price that didn&#x27;t have any petroleum ingredients and was natural. I found this and it had great reviews and also met my price and health criteria. So I purchased this in hopes that it would work much better than the Burts Bees and Whole Foods lip balms. And it did! I don&#x27;t have to use it as much as the other lip balms and my lips feel soft after using it. It also helped heal the spots on my lips that I had peeled because they were so dry after using the other lip balms. Everything about this product was great. Even the packaging is real nice and simple. The only thing that took a little getting used to was the taste of the lip balm. The other lip balms didn&#x27;t have any taste and were just plain, this actually has a kind of sweet minty taste to it almost like mint candy. At first, I didn&#x27;t like it, but now It is actually nice for it not to be so plain once I got used to it. Of course, it&#x27;s not something you eat, so it&#x27;s not like it was a big deal but on occasion when you lick your lips or whatever it is a nice addition to the already great things about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, overall this was a really great product and met my expectations at all levels and even exceeded them in some. If you have had trouble with other lip balms or are simply looking for a really good lip balm, this is a great product to try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 11-20-16&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally rated this 5 stars but I am changing my review to 2 stars. After using this product for a while, there was still room left to be desired. Compared to what I had used before, it worked better than anything else. But I was still having issues with. It would create a layer on my lips that would feel very dry and uncomfortable which would cause me to peel my lips which was​n&#x27;t good for my lips. I was constantly peeling off this dry layer. I finally tried a new product called lip locks by candid essentials that better filled those voids. Ever since I began using the new product, I was picking and peeling my lips much less. I also did not have the strange sensation that was created by the layer on my lips that beauty by earth was creating. It wasn&#x27;t until now that I am changing my review because I found some unused beauty by earth recently and decided to give it another try to be for sure that I gave the product a fair shake before revising my review. At first, when I put it on, it felt fine like the liplocks. But, after drying, sure enough, I could feel that uncomfortable and weird layer on my lips and I started picking them again. I immediately went back to the lap locks and the layer/sensation went away after using it for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My conclusion is that while Beauty by Earth attempts to moisturize your lips, it actually ends up putting a layer above your lips that is uncomfortable and makes you want to peel your lips instead of actually moisturizing your lips themselves. I would no longer recommend this product to anyone. The main differences I can see between the liplocks and the Beauty by Earth are that beauty by earth has sunflower oil, helianthus, lanolin, tocopherol, aloe leaf extract, and cocoa seed butter while liplocks does not. Liplocks has rosehip seed oil, cranberry seed oil, and avocado oil which beauty by earth does not. I&#x27;m not sure which of those ingredients caused the major differences I noticed, but those are the differences I see between these two products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would advise you caution yourself with the reviews for this product and consider the fact that many reviewers here may not have tried a better product and so they rate it 5 stars based on previous experiences. While I would rate this better than Burts Bees, and once rated it 5 stars, after experiencing Lip Locks, I would never go back to beauty by earth, particularly because it makes my lips uncomfortable, causing me to peel them, and does not moisturize them as well. The difference for me between the two products is enough for me not to finish using the Beauty by Earth I have left, even though I don&#x27;t like to waste products I have spent money on.ews for this product and consider the fact that many reviewers here may not have tried a better product and so they rate it 5 stars based on previous experiences.

    <li> Great product! My kids get dry lips during the winter and are really picky about what they like. They love the lip balm and tge peppermint smell!</li>
    <li> I am using this lip balm for some of my friends for the holidays.  I like it because it is all natural and helps my lips.......</li>
    <li> Works great! I love how smooth it makes my lips and it lasts a long time. My only complaint is that it tastes sweet, so it can interfere if you are eating anything. Will definitely buy it again, though!</li>
    <li> Extremely smooth and long-lasting lip balm. Scent and flavor appeals widely among members of our home.</li>
    <li> I love lip balm.  More importantly I love naturaL lip balm.  Keeps mmy lips supple and doesn&#x27;t dry them out.</li>
    <li> I ordered these based on the reviews. They did not disappoint. Mild peppermint flavor with no tingle.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this chapstick. And, you are talking to someone who is chapstick-picky. I use chapstick every day and have only found a few brands that I like. This one has a fantastic barely there flavor and feel that is just perfect, I use it like 6 times a day. This is my second order as I went through my first one so fast as I used it so much! I probably will never use a different chapstick.</li>
    <li> Product arrived promptly. It was packaged nicely. Left my luos very soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> this lip balm made my lips super soft and I loved that it&#x27;s all natural! I have really chapped lips when I wake up so I use this when I go to sleep and wake up with smooth lips. thank you!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product.  I liked the company and their natural products promoted, but sadly I have given it a few months and I can&#x27;t stand this lip balm.  I bought all 4 for myself, as I LOVE mint lip balm but this brand makes my lips burn.  In fact, it actually irritates my lips so much I can&#x27;t wear it.  I wish I could return them all, but waited to try the product longer to give it a chance... time has not proven that I like it any better.  Perhaps their other flavored lip balms are better, but I won&#x27;t be buying them.  Back to Eos mint for me.</li>
    <li> Perhaps the best lip balm I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Sweeter than I was hoping, but it&#x27;s smooth and feels nice on the lips.</li>
    <li> Love the lip balm. It&#x27;s soft and silky on the lips! I like how its not feeling like you have something pasted on.but rather it  feels smooth.</li>
    <li> Really nice lip balm, light but effective, with a really nice slightly minty touch.&lt;br /&gt;Great to have 4 tubes as well.  I like it!</li>
    <li> Great product. Nice mint taste. I used it over an hour ago &amp; it is still on my lips. Very thick. It is important to me that it is natural with no toxins.</li>
    <li> Freaking awesome!!!! Really keeps lips moistured instead if having that typical sensation of dryness after a while of applying.  My husband is addicted to lip balm.  He is so used to Chapstick, that I&#x27;ve been trying to get him to use something natural for a while now.  He loved this one!!! My son does too!!! No more Chapstick at home!</li>
    <li> Like everybody&#x27;s been saying, this is the cream of the crop when it comes to lip balms. Glides on wonderfully, has a pleasant minty scent, and leaves lips feeling super moisturized. I usually put it on right before bed and I wake up with just the most supple lips! I will re-purchase when I run out (or lose it).</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lip balm. i always put on lip balm before my lip color and this one moisturizes very well and lasts for hours. i will definitely buy again!!!</li>
    <li> I have &amp;#34;exfoliating cheilitis,&amp;#34; which means that my lips peel severely! It is truly a debilitating disorder. I have tried EVERYTHING!!! This product was exactly what I need. It is made of natural ingredients (I especially require a product containing beeswax). Also - this lip balm isn&#x27;t full of perfumes and chemicals which make the shedding of the skin on my lips! I would recommend this balm to anyone with similar considerations as me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to lead a natural lifestyle for the past two months and the first thing I looked for was natural lip balm. I was going to buy EOS, but found these instead, and let me tell you, these are AWESOME!!! I&#x27;m not too much of a mint person, but I like the cool feel on my lips (maybe it&#x27;s just minty food that I&#x27;m not crazy about). I love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural and I can pronounce the ingredients. I used to use petroleum jelly on my lips before I realized that petrolatum is a by-product of gas (blechh!). I&#x27;m still on my first stick after one month, so the whole pack goes a long way (depending how often you put it on). I use it at least twice every day and first time lasts throughout class!</li>
    <li> This lip balm is amazing, all natural ingredients, silky soft for my lips and tastes great. I dislike Chapstick because it feels like wax. This stuff is so much better.</li>
    <li> It is very refreshing and moisturizing but light at the same time. Definitely will get great use this summer!</li>
    <li> I love the smell and how it feels on my lips!</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I love that it is made of all natural ingredients. It also smells amazing and keeps my lips really hydrated.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so nice to find a natural lip balm for my very sensitive lips!  It goes on smooth and lasts.</li>
    <li> Good Product. But I didn&#x27;t find differences from others lip balm.</li>
    <li> Really love it! Just tried it and I ordered more, excited for it to get here. I have a really hard time with constantly chapped lips and this stuff is my go-to to fix it.</li>
    <li> My lips love this product!  I have slowly been changing to more natural products and this lip balm is now definitely part of my daily regiment.</li>
    <li> I like the lasting smoothness of this balm.  Great balm. Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Wonderful Stuff!  I bought a pack recently and love it so much, it is going to be in the family &#x27;stocking stuffer&#x27; pack from now on.  Love the mint flavor, love the long lasting non-greasy feel.</li>
    <li> seems to work well and last thank you</li>
    <li> Feels great, not waxy.  It&#x27;s a little sweet. I&#x27;d personally prefer more peppermint.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and smells so good!</li>
    <li> Exactly what you want in a lip balm, Spreads well, covers well, keeps the lips protected.</li>
    <li> This lipstick is exactly what I was looking for - 100% natural without any chemical after taste. Tastes nice and fresh and lasts longer than other brands I have tried AND feels great on the lips, not greasy like some other brands.  It has a nice mint taste. I have only 1 request to the manufacturer - please bring more flavours!  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm. It goes on very smoothly and I don&#x27;t have to keep reapplying it. I also really love the light peppermint smell. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I am a bit of a lip balm addict and am always looking for great lips balms!  I love that it is 100% Natural Beeswax Lip Balm, No Chemicals, No Soy, No Parabens, No Petroleum.  This just makes me feel great about using it.  Best of all I love how effective it is.  My lips feel moisturized and smooth after use.  Plus I adore the little tingle I get from peppermint flavor.  I now have this stashed in my purse and all over the house when ever I need it.  It is a really good price for a very high quality and great working product!</li>
    <li> This leave my lips feeling super smooth and I would totally recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> Product last along time.  It is super smooth and the soothing effect is great!  All natural, you can&#x27;t beat it.  Great price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a nearly habitual user of lip balm because of my job (pilot), so I had to give this a try. I chose this product because of the natural ingredients and glowing reviews, and I have to say that it&#x27;s right on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right out of the box, it tastes &amp; smells very pleasant, and also seems to last longer on the lips than average. Equally impressive, it didn&#x27;t melt in my car on a hot summer day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Great lip balm.  Stays on for a long time and hydrates the lips.  Would purchase again!!</li>
    <li> I just got this product in the mail and I am absolutely in love with it! The minty tingle with the super moisture and a natural product has me sold on it.</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm! It feel great and my son loves it too. I now carry one in my purse and always have one by my nightstand.</li>
    <li> Super soft! and the best part is it does not dry out my lips after use like all other lip balms I have tried!! Super happy I found this one!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Feels really nice on the lips and so effective and there is no residue left behind which happens at times with other lip balms I have used. I put it on once in the morning and I did not need to put it on till the next day. So much better than any other lip balm I have used. I would highly recommend to anyone with really dry lips or just want to keep your lips nice and soft!</li>
    <li> Excellent that is why I reordered it!</li>
    <li> My kids and I love this lip balm! It&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t taste like plastic.  It has not been easy finding a lip balm/chapstick that my son is willing to use. A friend had posted Ofcom Facebook so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It works great. My son will actually keep this stuff in his pocket and apply it on his own.  Plus, the pack came with several so each of us have our own and I don&#x27;t have to worry about spreading germs.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is so much better than Burt&#x27;s Bees which I have been using for years! I will definitely buy again and again!</li>
    <li> When I first used the product I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like the peppermint scent, but as I used the lip balm I was proved wrong.  I have always used lip balm and have always used the same brand; BUT I really love Beauty by Earth&#x27;s lip balm!  I guess I have two lip balms I always use now!  The ingredients are really clean and my lips feel great with Beauty by Earth&#x27;s lip balm!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these lip balm every night and I think it protects my lips very well from getting dry. I used to have very dry lips in the morning especially but not any more. And also it&#x27;s not sticky and looks very natural. I totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> Best Chapstick EVER! I am a bit of a Chapstick snob and have been looking for a new feel good Chapstick-this one hands down wins! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever buy any other brand. I already want to buy some extras for stocking stuffers this Christmas for family/friends. I just know they will fall inlove with it also.</li>
    <li> Nice and smooth. Tasty too</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to use on my lips before bed. I&#x27;ve tried a million lip balms but this one has been the best. I like that it has peppermint because it plumps your lips and smoothes lines so when I wake up my lips feel great.</li>
    <li> This chapstick is awesome! So smooth, totally natural and tastes great! It isn&#x27;t sticky and doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips. It is seriously so good.</li>
    <li> Great product--not the cheap perfumed stuff. My wife tried it and loved it, and I have to agree. Keep up the great work!</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm!!  I am picky about lip balm but I like that it feels light but moisturizing.  I would highly recommend this product and company.</li>
    <li> Love it! Smooth with a light tingle. I&#x27;m not really a fan of peppermint, but I like this.</li>
    <li> This is a nice lip balm. It goes on smooth. An issue I always fine is that some lip balms are harder and rough going on, so this past the first test for me. Has a nice smooth feeling after using it, and has the slight peppermint smell that is not over powering. I would recommend if you&#x27;re looing for a better lip balm.</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm. Goes on smoothly, smells good, even tastes good! I will definitely buy this lip balm again!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Natural ingredients. Makes lips smooth.</li>
    <li> Very impressed.  Works better then the store bought ones.  Texture is a little more &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34; but goes on and stays.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I have tried a TON of lip balms and this is among the best.  Love knowing it doesn&#x27;t have all that junk that other mass produced lip balms have.</li>
    <li> I got this because I had lost all my other chap-sticks of different brands. I have been using chap-stick frequently and wanted to try something new. At the time I was unaware that many chap-stick brands actually dry out your lips. This one though, from the moment you put it on, you can feel it working. Long after it wears off, your lips still feel moisturized. Plus who doesn&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s all natural and peppermint flavored?</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a lip balm that as a guy I can use and isn&#x27;t too feminine.  I was attracted to this because it is a natural alternative and the labeling is low key and doesn&#x27;t scream childish or girly.  After using it for a day, its consistency is good, it seems to last reasonably well and it doesn&#x27;t provide a lot of gloss...all positives.  Its fragrance is a little strong, but it is peppermint so that&#x27;s not too bad, I can pass it off as a mint.  : )</li>
    <li> This goes on smoothly but the mint is fairly strong and I am just not a mint person I guess.  So this will be given to others who will hopefully tolerate the mint.  I wish it came unflavored.</li>
    <li> Loved the product! Will definitely order again in the future.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that this is the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve been a hardcore &amp;#34;chap stick&amp;#34; addict for years, but I constantly lose them or toss them after my toddler gets a hold of them. I decided to try something more natural since he likes to apply it and lick it off... Or, in some cases, eat it right out of the tube. I will say that itisn&#x27;t nearly as thick as conventional lip balm, but it absorbs and moisturizers for hours! It is a tad bit gritty, I&#x27;d assume from the coconut oil, but if you rub your lips together the grit melts. And I mean it when I say it moisturizes for hours. Instead of using chap stick every hour or 2, I put this on maybe 2-3 times a day and my lips are way softer than they ever were before!  The mint is refreshing without being over powering. This and Eos are the only ones I&#x27;ll use now, but this is by far my fave!</li>
    <li> My son and I have severely dry lips in the winter. This product is amazing. It moisturizers and corrects the problem within the first couple of applications. In addition, it provides a cooling tingling sensation. I&#x27;ll definitely  purchase more!</li>
    <li> As a self-described lip balm-aholic and connoisseur,  I fully recommend this product. love the feel, taste, and relief this provides. This is one of the only balms I&#x27;ve tried that leaves my lips feeling better than before application. Most products tend to try my lips out after it wears off but this one doesn&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> This lip balm is decent. It tastes like candy and is a little grainy. The one issue I have with it that knocked 2 stars off is the fact that it does not last long at all. You put it on and it feels like it dries up in 5 minutes. If you&#x27;re looking for something long lasting, I recommend something different.</li>
    <li> I love the way this goes on your lips.  It isn&#x27;t hard and waxy. Plus, it has a refreshing peppermint taste!  Best lip balm I&#x27;ve found and love that it&#x27;s made with clean ingredients!</li>
    <li> Delicious! I look forward to using this stuff every morning. It tastes like Altoids but without the aftertaste. The ingredients are clean and natural, including coconut oil, beeswax, peppermint oil, and shea butter. No nasty chemicals. I usually just use coconut oil to moisturize my lips, but in Minnesota winter (which includes fall and spring) it is often necessary to use a something richer. The Beauty By Earth Lip Balm is easily the best solution. I like it more than Burt&#x27;s Bees, and I don&#x27;t have to question the ingredients of something I apply to my mouth.</li>
    <li> At a young age I became addicted to Chapstick. I have had a stick in my pocket since for about 20 years. My wife recently got on an &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; kick, so I tried this lip balm. I will never go back. The feel is 1000% (yes, the extra 0 is warranted) better. Do yourself a favor and just order it.</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service and product is hands down the best natural lip balm around at a great price in just a sort time this product help my lips from chapped, craked and pealing. This product also last a long time without reapplying over and over again. This product does not leave a thick coating and leaves a clean and refreshing layer. You will not find a quality product like this one for such a great price I have ordered two of this lip balm after great results and will order more soon.</li>
    <li> I have had perpetual dry, flaky, lips for years because it is a side effect of my medication. I have tried so many products that are very expensive and have been disappointed by almost all of them because it wouldn&#x27;t be before long my lips started to flake again. I have been using this for over three weeks and I think I have finally found the lip treatment that I can keep my lips smooth for a long time. Unlike other products, I don&#x27;t feel the need to keep reapplying. I love this product and I hope one day they expand the line and make tinted versions of it.</li>
    <li> This product is the best lip balm I have ever used, I highly recommend it to all!</li>
    <li> Nice flavor &amp; scent.  Not at all waxy.  Stays on well.  I bought three brands to test during the winter.  Haven&#x27;t tried the other two yet, but like Beauty by Earth very much.  Previously I&#x27;d tried the &amp;#34;Bees&amp;#34; brand &amp; didn&#x27;t care for that at all.</li>
    <li> OMG!!  This lip balm is the BEST ever!  I got the multi flavor pack and I cannot decide which one I like best!  They glide on smoothly, taste fabulous and work like a charm!  I HIGHLY recommend this lip balm!  I know I will not be getting anything else from here on out!  I&#x27;d give it 10 stars if I could!</li>
    <li> I really loved the product, I have been using Burts Bees for years and Beaty by Earth Lip Balm was a great alternative. Everything they use is 1--% natural and pure with no petroleum or paragon added. I will definitely be coming back to get some more after my set of 4 is done.</li>
    <li> Probably the best lip balm i have used, none of the chapstick feeling on the lips.</li>
    <li> Wonderful lip balm very moisturizing a favorite of ours</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  I like that it is 100% natural and glides on very smooth.  I love the minty feel.</li>
    <li> This is a great lip balm. I am a total snob about Chapstick/lip balm and I love this! It goes on smooth, and has a great smell and taste. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Wonderful Chapstick! I will re-order.</li>
    <li> Works great. When I first used it, I did not like it because the peppermint felt a bit too strong, but I love it now.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product! Goes on super smooth and leaves your lips feeling soft which is perfect for this cold weather! I would absolutely buy this product again and recommend to others!</li>
    <li> Hear about this from someone I worked with. This stuff is awesome!</li>
    <li> Great lip gloss also has the cooling mint which feels great on your lips</li>
    <li> Good so far. I love the scent and the feel of it. Seems to do a good job of moisturizing. I&#x27;ve been using for a week and am pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Updated 4/16/2015 - I&#x27;ve been using this lip balm all winter and I love it. I prefer it to any other I have.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this chapstick for about a week. So far I am impressed. It definitely lasts longer than other chapsticks. I am only rating it 4 stars because I wish it had different flavors. Will buy again and I will update my review after I have had it for a longer period of time.</li>
    <li> The first shipment I received was wonderfully creamy and soothing to my badly chapped lips. The second shipment of 4 tubes was grainy and tasted odd....I was afraid to use them and ended up discarding them.</li>
    <li> My husband has depended on  medicated Chapstick for years, and I thought I would give him something to compare it with... No comparison!! This lip balm by Beauty by Earth is by far superior in every way!  I had to get one for myself, and, now I&#x27;m sharing with my family and friends. When it comes to quality lip protection, this is it! I love the 4 pack packaging, too.  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Similar to Burts bees but better :)</li>
    <li> Love the lip balm.  I would give it 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm.  I am someone who uses lip balm throughout the day.  I don&#x27;t use lipstick, but need to have a lip balm nearby.  I have a &amp;#34;lip balm graveyard&amp;#34; of all the lip balms I have bought and abandoned. The first few times I used this I thought it was going to go the same route as the other &amp;#34;nearly okay&amp;#34; ones, but then I really liked it.  I like the fact it comes in a four pack as once you find the lip balm you like - you gotta have one in each place you might need one....  :)</li>
    <li> Love this Chapstick. It smells &amp; tastes great. I also love how it doesn&#x27;t feel waxy on my lips.</li>
    <li> I am soooooo picky on my lip balm after reading many articles on what ingredients you find in many...I only like all natural products...and even if it says natural..I research and read to make sure it really is...THIS PRODUCT IS AWESOME..,!...not only does it go on so smooth..not in chunks..or too hard to smooth on but feels so refreshing on my lips and lasts much longer than any product I have tried...loving anything peppermint is a bonus too..although I wouldn&#x27;t mind if they made another flavor to try!</li>
    <li> loving this lip balm!  i&#x27;ve always used burts bees and this is even better!  and i love that it comes 4 to a pack!</li>
    <li> I am always looking for an all natural lip balm that I like. I tried Burt&#x27;s Bees, but, it just wasn&#x27;t right. My husband is so use to actual &amp;#34;Chapstick&amp;#34; and I have been trying to find one he likes as well that has natural ingredients in it. This one has natural ingredients, is smooth and feels good on my lips. It also lasts longer than any other lip balm I have used. My husband also likes it and is using it as well.</li>
    <li> I really like how you can actually tell that it&#x27;s all natural. It doesn&#x27;t clump at all. It&#x27;s very smooth and the mint isn&#x27;t over powering at all. It&#x27;s a very good product and a great price for all natural lip balm!</li>
    <li> Yum!  I love the smooth glide-on feel of it and the little kick of peppermint tingle on my lips when I put it on.  I also really, really appreciate that it has no soy ingredients.  Some other lip balms I&#x27;ve tried, that were soy-free, felt rough or chalky when applying, which isn&#x27;t the end of the world, but this feels like a lip balm should on one&#x27;s lips.  A winner.</li>
    <li> Love the feel of this lip balm. Will definetly tell my friends about it.</li>
    <li> Best lip balm I have used and I&#x27;ve used lip balm since I was 15, I&#x27;m now 63.  I was a constant chapstick user and all it does is dry your lips out and the camphor is addictive. I&#x27;ve tried many other types but they didn&#x27;t help at all. The natural ingredients and beeswax has cleared up the dryness and made my lips as smooth and moist as my skin</li>
    <li> This is awesome Chapstick. You can feel the difference in quality of ingredients the 1st time you put it on. It is smooth and the peppermint is a little tingly (my lips are a little chapped, could be why). I have always preferred bath and body works c.o. Bigelo in the black tube. I have used it for years, but I have found a new one that feels more smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave the white color around the lips.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used - great texture - long, long lasting - pleasant mild peppermint flavor that disappears soon enough so you don&#x27;t end up licking your lips and leaving them more chapped ! Highly recommend !</li>
    <li> Wish I&#x27;d used this over the summer--the mint is super refreshing! Love the way it feels on my lips. Smooth and soothing. Not waxy or gooey. It&#x27;s my new favorite balm.</li>
    <li> Very smooth and comfortable. Like it</li>
    <li> First of all, I want to say that I&#x27;am a Chinese and now I live in China, so yes, I brought this lip balm and sent it back to my country. in fact I havent got this one, one of my friend told me that this is very good and made by natural so i just want to buy one for a try...hope it&#x27;s like what she said~</li>
    <li> My lips became very irritated and burning and were swollen for two days. I&#x27;m sure it was some type of ingredient in the product. I&#x27;m not sentitive. I can use Carmex and I&#x27;m great. The taste of this product makes it very hard not to eat it off.  LOL</li>
    <li> I had really high hopes for this after reading tons of 5-star reviews, but sadly this did not help my dry, chapped lips at all.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and use a lot of products.  This product is a great value.  I can get four and keep each one in different places. I like the mild minty essence.</li>
    <li> Absolutely, 100% recommend this lip balm! I am picky about them because I hate that most make my lips peel, or are too thick, or don&#x27;t actually moisturize, etc... I have had another favorite that I couldn&#x27;t find in stores anymore, and I came looking for another option. Natural is important to me, which is how I found this one. When it arrived I was super happy that all the 5 star reviews weren&#x27;t lying. Even better yet, it&#x27;s minty, and slightly tingly after you apply it. It feels good, tastes good, goes on smoothly, and keeps my lips from cracking.</li>
    <li> Got this balm for my wife as a Christmas stocking stuffer. She loves it, and I&#x27;ve even taken a tube for myself. Usually &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; balms aren&#x27;t as smooth but this product is great.</li>
    <li> I purchased this about a week ago and love it :-) It&#x27;s my new favorite. I have been using chapstick for over 25 years and have tried several other brands and just have not liked them. I always end up back to chapstick. I applied this last night and 8 hours later it&#x27;s still on my lips!</li>
    <li> Awesome,product, and shared one with a co-worker. My wife has been eye-balling the remainder of my Beuaty By Earth, but she knows it&#x27;s paws off as she has stolen other lip balms from me in the past! This balm is different, creamy, quenching and the peppermint is so pure and powerful. Love it!</li>
    <li> best chapstick I&#x27;ve tried, not too hard or soft. doesn&#x27;t make my lips peel!</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm.  It smells great and is doesn&#x27;t go on really thick when you apply it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, all natural, great peppermint after taste... Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Unlike the usual drugstore lip balm, my lips stay moisturized. I have fewer cold sores too! Nice natural fragrance. Reasonable price - highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Yes, this really IS good stuff.  The best I&#x27;ve ever used.  And it tastes wonderful....a strong fruity, minty taste that is not objectionable.  I&#x27;ve had cancer spots removed from my lips, so I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of lip balms, and this is tops.  It lasts.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing lip balm! It is so buttery and feels so great on my lips. I use it every day. I have tried a few different lip balms including Natural Ice, Chapstick, eos, and bhuddabalm. Of all of these, Beauty brand lasts the longest and I don&#x27;t need to reapply nearly as often as I have to with other brands. I am really glad that I found this on amazon!! Highly recommended :)</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this lip balm. It&#x27;s very moisturizing, has good ingredients, and it tastes like candy canes which is awesome. There is literally not one bad ingredient in here which even eos has bad ingredients.</li>
    <li> Moisture rich lip balm with a fresh taste and scent. I keep a tube in my purse, another in my pocket, and one in my gym bag.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I have lips that chap and split as soon as Fall hits. This stuff has honestly been a lifesaver! It&#x27;s a bit gritty in consistency (for exfoliating purposes), so just a head&#x27;s up--but it just makes the moisturizers in the balm work better.</li>
    <li> Great taste, nice lip balm!  Good actually natural ingredients</li>
    <li> I am quite pleased with this lip balm! It is comparable to the name brand stuff that comes in the yellow tube... the biggest difference is this stuff feels like it actually soaks in and hydrates; whereas, the name brand seems to just cake on top of the lips. I will be getting more of this stuff!</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm. I had so much trouble with chapped lips. Got me out of bed at 4 am, desperate, went on amazon looking for help. So glad I found this lip balm, after one week I no longer feel like a lip balm addict ! Yeah!</li>
    <li> Just received a week ago.  I have dry lips and I have to use lip balm several times a day even Summer time.  I have been using this one for a week once a day and my lips are not too dry any more.  I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Just the right amount of peppermint.  Smooth. Good product.</li>
    <li> I love the all natural ingredients and especially the way that it makes my lips feel (soft and moisturized).  This lip balm has the right amount of peppermint too!</li>
    <li> Excellent product , would buy again !</li>
    <li> Very smooth, fresh mint flavor and feels really good on. Shipment came on time.</li>
    <li> Love it, the peppermint is very refreshing and unlike most lip balms it adds a nice gloss to your lips making them love vibrant and healthy (without makeup)and lasts quite some time. Another note: the peppermint at first application feels a little strong but after a few uses your lips become used to it and then its the perfect amount of mint.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff....all the flavors are spot on! I am glad it isn&#x27;t too sweet like you get at the store! I definitely recommend all the balms!</li>
    <li> This lip balm is very nice. I cannot stand peppermint nor having balm on my lips but I actually like this. The balm feels light but is moisturizing and the peppermint is not overwhelming.  It seems sort of sweet to me which I like. My acne medication can dry my lips out but this balm works well to remedy that and I love that it is natural and has no petrolatum in it. My fianc&amp;eacute; who is a picky hippy likes this as well. The seller is also wonderful.  I think for the price, this balm is an excellent deal.</li>
    <li> Originally bought as a gift but the packaging was so tiny I had to keep for myself.  Ordinary Chapstick, not impressed.</li>
    <li> These make my lips HAPPY! It&#x27;s perfectly smooth chap stick, no stickiness or clumps. It leaves a nice tingle on your lips from the mint I think. Smells nice and natural. Really like this chap stick!</li>
    <li> I have tried many different lip treatments and this one beats them all hands down. I will definitely be buying this product again. thank you for making a product that finally cured my dry cracked lips:)</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my daughter who  loves the beeswax products. She was delighted with the find and states they help a lot with dry lips in the winter. Very pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on a quest for the best lip balm. I&#x27;m leaving 5 stars for this one because I haven&#x27;t found a better one yet. It goes on smoothly, and is not a sticky as beeswax balms sometimes are. It smells good and tastes good, too. It lasts decently long, but I do wish it lasted a little longer. Nevertheless, it&#x27;s become my go to lip balm for now, and I expect it will stay that way for a while.</li>
    <li> I have to take the time to let everyone know what I have discovered about this lip balm. Not only is it amazing as just a lip balm but I now use it as my lip primer when wearing lipstick. I am 66 an have trouble with feathering but this has eliminated that problem. The best primer I have found and your lipstick color stays true!  Yea.</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm. It helps my lip moisturize, and I&#x27;m very confident when go outside. My mother also likes it and requests 2 more.</li>
    <li> I use lip balm daily and this is my new favorite.  The lip balm feels smooth and moisturizing with a pleasant barely there flavor. I like the fact that the ingredients are natural and chemical -free.  This is my new go-to lip balm that I keep in my handbag, in the car and in the house. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Best lip balm that I have ever used.  I having been using chap stick/lip balm for years and years.  I can truly say that this one does the trick. It is refreshing and keeps my lips feeling healthy.  I love using it.  I bought the 4 pack.  I ended up giving my friends one.  All of them them loved the product!  Great quality with truly great and natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Love the peppermint. Wanted a all natural lip balm and this was perfect.</li>
    <li> Great product! I tend to get very chapped lips and this product works better than other natural lip balms I have used. I highly recommend it and so does my 14 year old daughter.  Love the minty flavor.</li>
    <li> I ordered this just in time for winter and it is def well received! My lips fell nourished, without feeling overly dependent on the lip balm like some other products. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly sweet and tingly. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much flavor from an all natural lip balm, but I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, nice packaging. It&#x27;d make a nice stocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is amazing and smells amazing feels amazing!! I got it so fast after placing my order. I would buy this lip balm over and over again!! Worth the money and so much better then what you find in a store!!!! I would recommend this lip balm over and over again!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s rare these days when a product exceeds your expectation. This is how I would describe Beauty By Earth&#x27;s product. I must admit that I have tried many lip balms (Chapstick, Burt&#x27;s Bees, etc...)... all are better than having nothing on. After running out of Burt&#x27;s Bees, I decided to give Beauty By Earth&#x27;s lip balm a try. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. It goes on smooth (not waxy as the name may lead you to think). And to put on my tree-hugger cap... I appreciate it&#x27;s all natural ingratiates, and it&#x27;s earth friendly packaging.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff, so glad I purchased. It&#x27;s frustrating when other &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; products secretly have so much bad crap in them, not to mention your basic chapstick and all the chemicals in those. I will absolutely be purchasing this again, and I&#x27;m actually grateful this product is on the market!!!</li>
    <li> Love it, not too much peppermint, just right.  Keeps my lips moisturized - even though it is summer.</li>
    <li> Perfection is the only word for this lip balm! It feels, tastes, and looks great. It brings out color in my old lips that I didn&#x27;t know was there. I feel forty years younger.</li>
    <li> Too much peppermint which was a bit overwhelming for me.  I prefer a sutle hit of peppermint.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t use them.</li>
    <li> The lip balm is one of the best lip balms I have used. It leaves my lips so silky smooth, and also helped heal my chapped lips.</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm so much, was so happy that they came out with the 4 pack!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a lip balm that was made with bees wax, cocoa butter, shea butter, etc and that left a cool breeze feeling on my lips and I came across this, so I tried it. I love it, it is exactly what I wanted and I plan on buying more when I run out. My only suggestion would be to maybe add some more flavor options, like wintergreen and spearmint. :)</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  I&#x27;m picky about and also can&#x27;t be without my lip balm and this one is fantastic, would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> It smells so good!&lt;br /&gt;It goes on so smooth and nice.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry your lips like other lip balm do.</li>
    <li> Silky smooth, way better than Chapstick.  The peppermint is fresh and cool. I really like this lip balm.  The all natural thing is a great bonus too.</li>
    <li> I love my lip balm, and one of those users who keep it in my car, by my bed, in my purse. So when I tried this peppermint lip balm, I was in love! The fact that it comes in a 4 pack is even better!</li>
    <li> These are really nice lip balms.  While other sticks can leave your lips feeling a little oily or coated, these glide on smoothly without feeling like you have a thick coating on.  Smells nice and not overwhelming.  Worth the extra bucks!</li>
    <li> Love the lip balm! IT came in a 4 pack and I gave one to my mom and one to my husband and the other to my daughter. Everyone liked using it and the peppermint scent was invigorating. It made us want to reapply often</li>
    <li> Love these products :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a week now and I&#x27;m definitely happy with it. My lips are usually distinctly dry and a nuisance. Using this lip balm they stay nice and moist for an extended time. They aren&#x27;t even bothering me as much in general after the immediate effect has worn off. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of lip balm but in the winter it&#x27;s kind of hard to avoid it. I&#x27;m glad I tried this lip balm. The main reason I wanted to try this lip balm was because it&#x27;s organic and does not contain petroleum. It defiantly repairs my chapped lips and it tastes amazing! Another plus is that it doesn&#x27;t give you shiny lips and it lasts a long time.  I will defiantly be trying the multi-flavored lip balms.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many other lip balms in the past and they have always either felt too &#x27;goopy&#x27; or leaving my lips feeling more dry after the products have worn off. Beauty by Earth has solved both problems. It works as advertised and moisturizes for most of the day! Recommended product!</li>
    <li> Super smooth and moisture rich...plus a great taste</li>
    <li> have used a lot of products because I have a tendency towards dry lips, especially because I use lipsticks, and have found this lip balm to be very nourishing for my lips--this lip balm is truly a BALM and you will love it!</li>
    <li> This product is a fantastic natural lip balm. I have been struggling with dry lips in the cold weather and this product gave me an immediate relief. It&#x27;s also not greasy which is always a plus!</li>
    <li> Great product and wonderful packaging. I like the fact that it came as a pack of 4. I am forever losing my lip balm and can&#x27;t find it when I really need it. So now I have one in my nightstand, one in my kitchen, and one in my car. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this 4-pack of peppermint and found out why people love it.  I am used to using Burt&#x27;s Bees and decided to give this product a try. This gives you a little minty tingle just like the Burt&#x27;s Bees, and feels very smooth, natural, and non-greasy on your lips. I will be re-ordering these for sure once I run out!</li>
    <li> Best lip balm I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> This lip balm is amazing!  I have had very dry lips this summer from airline travel and sun exposure.  I have tried several drugstore brands and nothing worked.  After reading the reviews I decided to give this a try.  I am so glad I did!!</li>
    <li> Very good product. It is definitely helping my chapped lips heal fast. Long lasting effect. I tried many lip balms but I felt this to be quite effective when compared to others. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this lip balm; it didn&#x27;t leave my lips feeling moisturized. I&#x27;ll go back to Chapstick or PuckerUps.</li>
    <li> Works great, feels great.</li>
    <li> Was a little worried that I would get some hard to use product. This glides on easily, leaves a nice sheen on my lips especially over lip tint. The flavor is not really a strong peppermint but rather a light mint that reminds me of cool sweet mint lifesavers. Leaves a nice flavor on my lips  and lasts a long time. I keep one by the bed to use at night, one in my purse. My only problems is my husband likes them so much he stole some of them and I need to order more!</li>
    <li> Great product! Smells great and kind of tingles on my lips. Ordered other scents from you guys and the pear one is definitely my favorite! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Hands down the very best natural lip balm we have used.  Worth 3x the price.</li>
    <li> One sentence : The best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used .</li>
    <li> Great lip balm!  Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Peppermint flavor is good, but for some reason the lip balm tingles in a not-so-great way</li>
    <li> Great texture and scent and it lasts forever!! Love that it&#x27;s all natural, I will definitely be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> This is worth the couple extra bucks for the better lip balm.  It&#x27;s a 4 pack so unless you&#x27;ve got lips like Patrick Ewing it should last a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this lip balm few days ago and it arrived in no time. I love the fact that its 100% natural and the mint touch on my lips. Also that it comes 4 in a box so I can have one in my office, in my car, in my bag and in my night stand.</li>
    <li> I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm for years and thought I would try this new product out for a change . I am not disappointed! It&#x27;s light, has a nice mint quality and feels good on.</li>
    <li> I have tried several lip balms throughout the years.  THIS IS THE BEST!!!!!  It is 100% natural and feels good on my lips.  I like the peppermint scent.  Peppermint has been used throughout the centuries for various ailments .  Studies show that the scent can relieve anxiety and improve memory.</li>
    <li> Works wonders on my lips!</li>
    <li> I purchased this lip balm due to all the positive customer reveiws here on Amazon. One of the main reasons being that most people said this balm is BETTER than Burts Bees, and I honestly do not care for Burts Bees balm at all ! However I do love mint balms and because this product is all natural I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. My only disappointed is that I like balms to have a little bit more shine to them and this is a bit flat (like burts bees).</li>
    <li> it does a good job of moisturizing, but I don&#x27;t love the flavor.  Too minty &amp; sweet, I can actually taste it sometimes when eating some thing else (like an apple). Please make a flavorless version.</li>
    <li> Me and my husband LOVE this!! We have peppermint.  Immediately noticed a difference and the next day my lips were do soft. I get really bad chapped lips in the winter. My 5 yr old loves it too! ! We will be buying tons of this.</li>
    <li> Great ingredients, but four star rating because although I don&#x27;t have extremely dry lips, I still have to reapply throughout the day contrary to what others have reviewed.</li>
    <li> Great lip balm!!! I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I was looking for an all natural lip balm to help prevent chapped lips, and this works great.  I love the flavor.  The 4 pack is a very good price.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm! I have very dry lips in the winter and these work great to heal them and they smell great too. I keep one in my car, purse, vanity and my husband keeps one in his pocket because he loves them and they don&#x27;t make it look like he is wearing lip gloss :) will definitely buy more when they run out!</li>
    <li> I am impressed with this product!  It does not contain sunscreen, which is an irritant to my lips.  It has a pleasant smell and taste.  It adds a slight shimmer too.  I like that it has quality ingredients!!</li>
    <li> Summary: Natural, smells great, feels great and heals lips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a professional photographer, and I give these lip balms to my headshot clients. I also use one myself. I have very dry lips, and I used to use Blistex products every night. I&#x27;ve used countless other products. As other reviewers have noted, this is the first lip balm that seems to genuinely heal my lips - I don&#x27;t feel like I have to continuously use it. The only other product that has been as good is Palmers Shea Butter Lip Balm, which also works. The mint in this lip balm is nice, and I like that the ingredients are readable and natural. My clients seem to like it, too.</li>
    <li> Great lip balm. I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
    <li> Excellent flavors! Well worth ordering!</li>
    <li> Wonderful lip balm, my whole family loves it!  Great seller, too</li>
    <li> This is fabulous lip balm. First of all I am a lip product junkie and I have a ton of them. I really like this one. It&#x27;s similar to Burt&#x27;s Bees but more smooth and silky. Kept my lips moist for hours. Also it has a nice minty refreshing essence. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> The smell is very pleasant, not overpowering. It is long lasting, I do not need to keep reapplying. It does feel a bit stickier and heavier than the ideal I was hoping for, but overall, it is one of my favorite lip balms to date, and I am a lifelong lip balm wearer. I also like the organic packaging.</li>
    <li> I ordered this lip balm for my son who has chronically dry lips.  He has tried many different balms and even one which a dermatologist recommended which was alright, but Best Lip Balm seems to even surpass the doctor recommended balm.  I tried some of this balm myself just to check it out.  I too, found it to be a great balm and will be buying some for myself.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to this lip balm and absolutely love it.  It is thick enough so it lasts on my lips, but not too thick that it doesn&#x27;t glide easily - perfect!  The peppermint scent/flavoring is just enough so it&#x27;s pleasant but not overpowering.  And the best part is that it&#x27;s made from all natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> pleasant, very light fragrance. LOVE LOVE LOVE that it is made of all natural ingredients. Actually bought it to use on a scar - already see results. And it is a great lip balm too!</li>
    <li> high quality, shipped quickly.  thank you!</li>
    <li> This lip balm is very nice.  It goes on smoothly and stays on for longer than average.  It has a mint scent and has a minty tingle on your lips.  I like using lip balm with all natural ingredients!</li>
    <li> Best lip balm I have ever used and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried many! All natural and tastes good too!</li>
    <li> I really like this lip balm very much. It is much smoother than any store brand I have ever purchased. It does not dry out my lips. It is does not have the waxy feel at all.</li>
    <li> Very good. A little too much glycerin I think? It tastes a little sweet on my lips even an hour later, which I don&#x27;t like (Others may?) It is a good quality product but not my favorite, I prefer natural chapstick that is more solid (less slick, less oily) and contains no discernible sweet flavor.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this lip balm.  It doesn&#x27;t stay on my lips very long, isn&#x27;t very moisturizing, plus the extra sweet flavor is slightly nauseating and a big turn off.  I won&#x27;t order again and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to others.  I am highly suspect of all the 5 star ratings... just beware.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have been using it since I&#x27;ve received them. I gifted one to my mother out of the package and she was happy too! I have psoriasis in many areas, including my face and lips. It is horrible and constantly drying out my skin. I decided to give this &amp;#34;BEST LIP BALM&amp;#34; a shot, I was even more swayed into trying the item once I realized all of the ingredients are natural and no harsh chemicals. This means no matter how much I apply I never have to worry about ingesting harsh chemicals :). When I put this stuff on my very chapped/peeling lips, it is instantly cooling from the peppermint, which I love and it is long lasting! It smoothes my lips and does give them a glossy shine. I have actually tried using this lip balm on my stubborn psoriasis elsewhere (face, arms, even behind my knees, and tops of my feet). The cooling peppermint is very nice and even helps relieve some or all of the itch. I love it! Any questions? Please feel free to ask! Overall, I would most definitely recommend this to a friend :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying these lip balms, I love how smooth they go on and the fresh tingle of the peppermint! I try to stay away from petroleum and artificial ingredients, especially with something I&#x27;m putting on my mouth, and these fit the bill perfectly! I am impressed with how long they last, they are not greasy, and stay smooth on my lips. Overall I am pleased!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great and lasts much longer than other lip Balms I have used.</li>
    <li> It might not be the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; lip balm some people are claiming, but with that being said it is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used to date. I still have to apply every so often throughout the day but nowhere near as often as the Chap Stick brand I&#x27;ve relied on for years. I&#x27;m very, Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Best Lip balm Ever!!!! It makes little clicks when you want more to come out , which is a really cool idea! and the lip balm healed my lip in a day- I love natural products and this is on my list to order it again soon!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost every other brand, Blistex, Aquaphor, Burt&#x27;s Bees, vaseline, but out of all of these top rated brands, Beauty By Earth beats them by a long shot. Every single other balm hardens my lips and cakes them with wax (or whatever that nasty stuff is). It makes me put on more and more every hour. Once I use this lip balm, I don&#x27;t have to reapply for at least half the day. It&#x27;s amazing. I think my search for the perfect lip balm has come to an end. THIS IS A MUST GET. Try it. you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> I am THE expert on chapstick!  I have used it daily for years.  This is BY FAR the best chaptstick there is!  It beats out Chapstick, Burts Bees, Soft Lips, Neosprine Night Relief and even Keihls!  There is a slight smell, but it is nice, not perfume-y that gives you a headache!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! It does what is supposed to.  It is by far the best lip balm I have ever used,.I live in a very dry weather area and I have been through hundreds of products cheap and expensive, this one is the best!  The first one I got was the Peppermint, a freeby that came with my Argan oil, I recently order this box of 4 so my husband and son can try  this miracle lip balm:)</li>
    <li> I love love love this lip balm.  It feels great on your lips and is all natural so I don&#x27;t mind having it on my lips where it might get in my mouth.  It smells great too!  My lips are smooth and healthy, I haven&#x27;t had it in the winter yet but I am hoping it will continue to perform well when the weather is dry and cold.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff.  I will be a repeat customer, this lip balm is great.  My lips are happy!</li>
    <li> I was hoping this was the kind of lip balm that comes free with the Argan Oil.  This is different. It still is very nice and moisturizing, but the flavor is a little strong (perhaps I have a lingering bad taste of peppermint schnapps from my younger years) and the texture is a bit soft. I really love the one that comes with the oil. How can I get more of that one?</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm! What I noticed the most is how long it stays on my lips. I have tried many brands but never have I had one last this long! It&#x27;s very smooth and soft. I love the peppermint smell, very fresh. I would absolutely recommend this lip balm.</li>
    <li> This Chapstick is awesome!! You can feel it working on your lips and hydrating them etc and afterwards it made my lips not peel at all and look good in my lipstick 💋 which when peeling was bad . I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I am a lip balm enthusiast! I LOVE lip balms! I have tried so many in search of the perfect one. I dislike the kind that sit on top of your lips and don&#x27;t feel like they are actually moisturizing, or the ones that taste waxy. The worst is when you have chapped lips and you put the lip balm on and it just goops up on your lips. I live in the Midwest where we have pretty cold winters and it gets very dry in the house. The ultimate test for me is to put the lip balm on before bed and then see how my lips are in the morning. The WORST is when you yawn in the morning and you get the cracks in the corners of your mouth! OUCH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lip balm is VERY moisturizing! You can feel it soaking in as soon as you put it on. It doesn&#x27;t feel waxy or sticky. It seems to last a long time as well. I put it on before bed and when I woke up my lips were not dry at all. It also lasts while eating. The 4-pack is nice, I can put one in my purse, one in the car, one next to the bed and one in my gym bag. I definitely recommend this one!</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff! The lip balm leaves my lips feeling amazing! Def recommend!!</li>
    <li> A wonderful lipbalm. I love having my lips moisturized and this natural lipbalm does it. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips like some other brands and the peppermint is refreshing and doesn&#x27;t leave some artificial flavor in your mouth.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is very good, keeps my lips very moist. What i don&#x27;t like about it, is the sweetness.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think lip balm should be that sweet.</li>
    <li> Love it! Love the natural feel and that it lasts for hours.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a dedicated Lip Trip user for 15 or 20 years (was previously a Carmex addict) and recently learned the sunscreen in Lip Trip was something to avoid. I haven&#x27;t liked most other brands I&#x27;ve tried, and wanted something in which beeswax was first ingredient. I think this one is going to fit the bill, although I wish the mint wasn&#x27;t so strong (I am going to try the Vanilla and the Honey, but really, I don&#x27;t think I want any flavor in my lip balm--it&#x27;s not to eat!) It goes on a bit more oily than I like, and compared to Lip Trip I feel like I need to reapply more often (say 24 times a day instead of 8) but this might just be adjusting to the drying feeling of the mint? After 4 days of using it, though, I do think it&#x27;s doing its moisturizing job, and I like that all the ingredients are natural and healthy. I&#x27;m saving my last tubes of Lip Trip for when I need the sun protection...</li>
    <li> I love this stick. It feels nice and smooth and the taste is sweet but too sweet. The only stick that heals my dry lips. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product if you have dry lips.</li>
    <li> I love this! I basically have dry lips due to my lack of water intake and constantly peeling dry skin from them with my teeth. I have tried lots of lip balm nothing ever works. So received this started instantly wearing to see if it works. It works for me. My lips are soft on a daily basis. The taste is pleasant. I gave one to my 7 year old daughter and 14 year old son. He says he haven&#x27;t had cracked lips since he started using it. I will be buying this again for the price is amazing for a product this good to come in a pack of 4.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is amazing! I love lip balm. This one makes your lips very soft and keeps them moisturized. I really recommended this product and the flavor is amazing!!!</li>
    <li> Recently I&#x27;ve been into collecting chapstick sand this one really blew me away. It really helped my lips and it made them feel much better. Also, it actually tastes like peppermint :P By far my favorite chapstick!</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it tastes exactly like it smells! So glad I ordered. Was going to use them as part of a gift but I am keeping them</li>
    <li> I was looking for an alternative to Burt&#x27;s Bees - something natural, not tested on animals, not owned by a large corporation. I found Beauty by Earth! I emailed the company to confirm that the products and ingredients are cruelty-free. The response was quick, professional and exactly what I wanted to hear. I ordered the lip balm right away. I was wary of the peppermint flavor because sometimes it can be overwhelming. It&#x27;s not though; it&#x27;s very subtle. The balm goes on smoothly, not greasy. I Love it.</li>
    <li> This product was received exclusively for reviewing purposes. The evaluation of the product had been conducted independently with no external influences from the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product set is presented in a thin cardboard box and contains 4 peppermint balms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each balm tube is 0.15oz in size and this makes them average sized. They are made of 100% natural ingredients with no petroleum, parabens, mineral oil, soy or any other undesirable chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although they are different in nature the application is the same as your standard lip balm; apply  as needed to dry or chapped lips or as a base for lip colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In use I found that the roll out mechanism worked well and the scent and taste of the peppermint was very pleasant and worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I had never thought about using natural lip balms before I&#x27;m certainly glad that I&#x27;ve been introduced to them as I will be putting less undesirable chemicals in my body whilst achieving the same benefits of normal lip balms.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best lip balm I&#x27;ve tried.  I used to purchase my lip balm in the checkout aisle while grocery shopping and I felt a little odd buying a pack of four through the internet but I&#x27;m glad I did.  This stuff tastes amazing and it stays on for awhile.  I gave a tube to my girlfriend and she said the same thing.  She also noted that unlike other lip balms she&#x27;s had in the past, this product seems to stay together better when its hot out.</li>
    <li> I decided the time had come to get myself off mineral oil-based &amp;#34;lip stuff.&amp;#34; While those are nice and shiny, your lips never get moisture.  This lip balm is different.  It is nourishing and healthy.  While I compulsively reached for it hourly at first I have noticed after about a week that my lips are happy and independent for the first time since my Bonne Bell discovery while in middle school.  I do find the mint a little too sweet, but I already shared one tube with my bestie. I will order more.</li>
    <li> this product does help smooth your dry lips.</li>
    <li> VERY good!  Lips feel hydrated for a much longer time than ordinary lip balms.  Highly recommend It!</li>
    <li> love this lip balm, very long lasting and silky smooth. Highly sartisfied.</li>
    <li> My first impression was of the very nice packaging. It would make a great stocking stuffer for the holidays. The product itself is truly great and different from other lip balms I have tried. Others seemed to actually make my lips chap. This glides on smoothly yet it isn&#x27;t sticky. I love the taste even though the taste isn&#x27;t long lasting. More important, the lip balm itself is long lasting. It stays on a long time and makes my lips soft again with no chapping. I am very happy that I took the chance and ordered a multi-pack of an unknown product. It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> Nice lip balm &amp; very soft.  I&#x27;m Not a peppermint fan so 3 stars for flavor.  If you like peppermint then 4*</li>
    <li> I decided to cut down on the toxins in my beauty products, and I tried a couple of lip balms before I settled on this one. The others somehow still made my lips feel chapped under a layer of wax. But this one really conditions my lips and it tastes delicious! I&#x27;m definitely sticking with this one.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try something with more natural ingridients.  The product is good and I like it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a highly reviewed lip balm on Amazon and came across this one.  Well liked by many people and the ingredients were wholesome.  So I tried it.  I have trouble finding lip balms that actually work and don&#x27;t make my lips more dry.  Beauty by Earth Peppermint 100% natural beeswax is great. I don&#x27;t feel like I have to continuously re-apply.  The peppermint is soothing and doesn&#x27;t appear to dry my lips out like I was afraid it would. I am glad I made this purchase and can see buying again in the future. I never write reviews but really like this product- the whole family did actually and would encourage anyone to try it.</li>
    <li> This product dried my lips and was not effective as other products for the relief of chapped lips. I liked the flavor and texture of the product, but the fact remains that it did not provide relief for my lips.</li>
    <li> GREAT!!!!!.....Many thanks</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, I&#x27;ve gone thru a ton of chapsticks and lip balm over the years and I have chronic dry lips since I was a child. It&#x27;s nice and good, but I want to say it&#x27;s nothing particularly special. I like to think it is doing something special with it&#x27;s ingredients. Maybe I should have gotten the non scented ones, I know peppermint can be a bit drying. I wish it came in a variety pack, now I have 4 peppermints.</li>
    <li> Very good lip balm. You can feel the difference wearing them. All natural ingredients and a nice tingly peppermint feel. I&#x27;ve given a couple to my friends too and they&#x27;ve also enjoyed them.</li>
    <li> I doubt all reviews posted for this product within short period of time, my lips are turning black after started using this lip balm.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  I love how smooth and hydrated my lips feel when I use it and the best part...it&#x27;s all natural!  Awesome!  :)</li>
    <li> Got this in today and I am so pleased! Smells and tastes great, glides on super smooth. Tried it under lipstick and it works perfect as a primer. I&#x27;ll definitely order again!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a natural and soothing lip balm that has every moisture get ingredient possible, then you&#x27;ll want to try this. The scent is really nice (peppermint) and not overpowering. The first ingredient is beeswax which is fantastic, and it also contains things like lanolin, coconut oil, and Shea butter. All natural and very healing. I also love the packaging, the black is really modern and clean looking while the text is simple. I will update this review when it&#x27;s winter time because that will be the REAL challenge.</li>
    <li> I live in a dry climate.  I&#x27;ve tried many lip balm products over the years to help with cracked lips.  The search is over.  This is the best product I have ever used.  It goes on smooth and coats my lips nicely.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and my lips are completely healed.  I highly recommend this quality lip balm.</li>
    <li> Both my wife and myself are LOVING these lip balms :)&lt;br /&gt;My wife keeps going on and on about it. She said &amp;#34;yesterday i put some on, then just a few minutes later, i wanted to put some more on. I just love this stuff! It makes my lips feel great, and even makes them shiny&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;We also ordered the 4 variety pack. I don&#x27;t even regularly use any lip balm, but i&#x27;ve found myself carrying the grapefruit/pomegranate one in my pocket all week..&lt;br /&gt;We used Burts Beeswax for a long time, but this is so much better, and for the same price!</li>
    <li> This is very natural and minty - I absolutely love it. I find that I don&#x27;t have to reapply as often as other chapsticks.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is fantastic. I am ready to place another order. Don&#x27;t think twice about using this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good match for my lips. Most balms feel waxy but they don&#x27;t seem to do anything for me. I decided to try this based on reviews I&#x27;ve read about it and so far, it seems to be working. Better, it tastes good.</li>
    <li> very good sfuff in before i use</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical of the peppermint and the beeswax as I&#x27;ve had some really bad reactions to burts bees, however I&#x27;ve had eczema on my lips for about a year now and I was desperate to find a lip balm that would help me with my flaky, itchy, dry lips. I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks, but so far it has great lasting power and I like the smell and taste. However, while my lips haven&#x27;t been itchy or reactive while I&#x27;ve used this lip balm, they have been flaking. I&#x27;m waiting to see if it passes over time. Meanwhile, I&#x27;ll continue using this product because its been one of the better lip balms to work for me.</li>
    <li> Great lip balm. Love that it&#x27;s all natural ingredients. As a guy, it creates too much shine for me, but oh well. It does its job and does it well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this chapstick for about a month now and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  The chapstick goes on so smooth and lasts for hours.  Unlike with other all natural brands that you can purchase in most stores, the Beauty by Earth Lip Balm will last most of the day, I don&#x27;t have to reapply every hour.  The peppermint scent is delicious but subtle.  This product also works great under lipgloss or chapstick.  On a side note, my husband also loves i!</li>
    <li> Smells good, tingles, light on the lips..but did not do the job. They don&#x27;t help with my chapped lips at all and have made my boyfriend&#x27;s worse.</li>
    <li> Smooth and gentle to apply, and minty.  Just what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> Good lip balm with pepperminty flavor.&lt;br /&gt;Too oily and sweet for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;So overall its average product, nothing special especially considering what it costs.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is really nice! I love they way my lips feel after using it. And the peppermint makes it extra special!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Easy to glide on. Very smooth. Best part. It is all natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best lip balm that I&#x27;ve ever used. It goes on smooth without any grittiness like some other lip balms, it contains all of the right natural ingredients and, best of all, it is cheaper than the name brand lip balms with similar ingredients. I will certainly be purchasing this again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Great chapstick and nice to know that it is all natural. Very nice smell/taste.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!!  Will definitely order again when I run out!  I bought the 4 pack for stocking stuffer gifts</li>
    <li> This leave my lips moist and soft all day.</li>
    <li> New fan of this all natural peppermint balm! Not too waxy, feels soft and lasts awhile.  The 4 pack was a good deal!</li>
    <li> I am in LOVE with this lip balm...so much so that I first purchased it on 29 Aug 2014 and then again on 23 Sep 2014.  You could say I&#x27;m addicted to lip balm.  I&#x27;ve tried numerous kinds but this lip balm is now my absolute favorite.  It leaves a smooth (not heavy) layer with a slight hint of peppermint.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This is hands down thee best lip balm. I am so glad I found this and ordered it. Its now thee only lip balm I will use. Very happy with this product</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm for many years and decided to change it up by ordering this product from Beauty by Earth. This balm has many similar ingredients to the Burt&#x27;s Bees product but it is smoother and feels more moisturizing. I am a fan of both products but this was a good choice for a change. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I like that its all natural. The ingredients are great. It does not give my lips a waxy feeling like other lip balms. I don&#x27;t think the peppermint is overwhelming either. It also comes at a great price. The company really stands behind their product and shows their customers that they truly care. I bought one to give to each of my family membersand they all like it. Maybe I will try their fruit flavors in the future.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this lip balm. But is it better than Burt&#x27;s Bees? I&#x27;d say not so. I prefer the latter. In contrast, this lip balm is thicker and more potent than Burt&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This is my go to lip balm :) I don&#x27;t feel like I have to apply it every two seconds. I wore this lip balm for my wedding along with a gloss and it kept my lips soft all day</li>
    <li> I received this lip balm as a bonus gift from Beauty by Earth.  It is VERY minty.  It is a little heavier feeling on the lips than a regular commercial lip balm.  The customer service department is amazing with their follow up, to make sure that I was happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Had a little mix up with shipping, which amazon went above and beyond to compensate me for. Received my products in a timely manner once problem was fixed, and have been more than pleased with both the Konjac facial sponges and the lip balm from Beauty by Earth!! I am in love, just as they said I would be in the product description. The sponges have made my face noticeably smoother after just a couple uses. The lip balm is moisturizing and the flavor of it is just amazing, and literally freshens your breath. I orders the fam back of mint lip balm and the 2 pack of the sponges (1original, 1 charcoal). Happy to say, I will be a regular customer of this family owned company! -Danielle</li>
    <li> Best chap sticks I ever own... Doesn&#x27;t leave residue like lots of other chap sticks I have used... I would recommend to my friends.. Bought 4 gave to my family n kept 2 for myself... They love it too! :D</li>
    <li> Love the all natural lip balm, some of the other store bought ones dont moisturize lips enough and my lips still peel. Love this one! Great buy!</li>
    <li> Nice lip balm with a powerful, minty aroma that can help mask an afternoon tuna sandwich prior to an important business lunch!  Good coverage for a little to go a long way. We&#x27;ll done.</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm! It has a wonderful texture and makes my lips feel so soft. It also lasts a long time and I don&#x27;t have to reapply it as much as other lip balms I&#x27;ve tried. It has a nice subtle peppermint scent and makes my lips feel amazing! I&#x27;m hooked! I feel great about the fact that it 100% natural.</li>
    <li> Finally, a perfect lip balm:  not too heavy or waxy  but very long lasting,  The peppermint flavor is a lovely touch.  It&#x27;s also unisex, so I can share them with anyone.  Great price for a quality product.  Being able to buy four at a time is a major convenience.  Great product for anyone, especially for Boston winters, and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is great!  I use it constantly and so does my husband.  It is very smooth and makes my lips feel healthy for several hours before reapplication.  It also tastes great.</li>
    <li> If you are like me and have tried all kinds of lip balms you might be surprised by this one. My lips feel so much better after just a week. I don&#x27;t feel like I have to use it all the time either.</li>
    <li> I like the product a lot. It is a great lip balm! Only problem is sometimes it breaks off in the tube; I lost a tube that way already. But the product itself is great!</li>
    <li> Loved this chapstick. Goes on easy and smells great!</li>
    <li> arrived as promised, great product</li>
    <li> Move over Burt&#x27;s Bees you have stiff competition! Love the subtle flavor of sweet peppermint, lasting moisturizer for dry lips, and the comfort of using an all natural product! I can&#x27;t say enough great things about the product and company! I am a Beauty by Earth fan and think you will be too if you give them a shot!!</li>
    <li> Very good lips balm for sensitive skin/lips people, I like their 100% natural and peppermint scent.  I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> These lip balms are the best! They glide on smoothly, smell great, and have a pleasant mint flavor. I always have dry lips and these are wonderful for keeping them soft and smooth with out being too shiny. They shipped to me really fast too!</li>
    <li> This is good stuff! I needed a lip balm that felt good on my lips, was somewhat long lasting &amp; could offer softening + repair.  Found it!</li>
    <li> Great product! Peppermint flavor is refreshing with a slight tingling on the lips when applied. It is fresh and long lasting.  This would make a great stocking stuffer.s</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this product. Works just as great! I will be purchasing this again in the future. Seller was prompt, package arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I have been a loyal Burt&#x27;s Bees user for years, but wanted a new chap stick that wasn&#x27;t owned by big business. Beaty by Earth is my new favorite. The mint is amazing! I plan on stuffing these into all our stockings this Christmas.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY lip balm I have found that doesn&#x27;t cause a reaction. I recently developed sensitivity to the products I have been using. I tried several products but my lips just got worse. This is the only balm I can put on my lips. No irritation and my lips feel soft and moisturized. I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> The peppermint feels great! It is easily applied and remains very light on the lips. It can be easily used by itself or under your regular lipstick. Because it is 100% natural, kids can use it too.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always on the search for a better lip balm.  This, along with EOS, are the best kind that I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
    <li> This awesome lip balm.  Very moisturizing!!  Plus smells and taste good as well.  Thank you for a wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;SQ</li>
    <li> Keeps my lips moist. No chemicals. Not greasy.</li>
    <li> Bought this a stocking stuffer for my husband but he ran out of his old kind before Christmas. He gets very dry lips during the Midwest winter at the factory and he loves it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m  a pretty big Chapstick user but could never find a product that fully satisfied me and didn&#x27;t dry out my lips. This product is so great and I will never use any other brand out there. It feels so silky smooth and lasts a long time. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> One of the best moisturizers for my lips I&#x27;ve used. No aftertaste. My son is using one also, which to me is proof it is good product.</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm. It does not make my lips even more chapped like a lot of other lip balms tend to do, but it is probably because this one is all natural! Feels good going on and I can already feel a difference ! Makes my lips nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have always been a big fan of the other beeswax lip balm in the yellow tube, but decided to give this product a try. I was extremely impressed. It has a nice tingle, goes on smooth, and I feel like it actually conditions my lips better than the other brand.  I will definitely be buying this again. A+++</li>
    <li> An amazing product with natural ingredients. Moisture is long lasting and it smells DELICIOUS!</li>
    <li> This works well. Good ingredients, effective, just the right texture and smoothness. No weird heavy fragrance or odd chemicals. And it&#x27;s a 4-pack, priced right. Thanks, Beauty by Earth!</li>
    <li> I was looking for an alternative to burt&#x27;s that was all-natural &amp; I found it with this product.  Love it and will continue to purchase for myself &amp; the family.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Was looking for something to be able to use in below-freezing temperatures and this should work. Like it for right now, even.</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm. It isn&#x27;t shiny and it is perfectly minty.</li>
    <li> I am a huge lip balm, gloss etc. consumer. This lip balm is not bad at all. It has a nice flavor and does the job. A lot of lip balms actually dry out my lips, and this one does not. It is not life changing lip balm, but it is a good staple. It&#x27;s basically a fancier chapstick with ingredients the manufacturer says are natural, so I suppose that is good :)</li>
    <li> My biggest issue with lip balm is that it disappears so quickly. I reapply so often that I feel like I have OCD. This is a remarkable balm. Tastes and smells lovely, has great staying power, and the packaging is beautiful. I bought the 4-pack and figured I&#x27;d have one in every room of the house for when I need to reapply but so far I&#x27;ve only used the first one. Excellent product--bravo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After two boxes of awful, gritty, mushy lip balm, and almost quitting this brand, my recent order is perfect. Thanks for finally getting it right.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite lip balm. Love the four pack, it&#x27;s a great value, and they work great.  Only need a few applications a day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Burt&#x27;s for years. Never been a fan of the petroleum based chap sticks for their obvious risk of cancer- look up ingestion of petroleum oil for yourself. So wax was fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without the soy, and with the added moisturizing oils, I&#x27;ve got to say my lips have never felt smoother or more supple. The extra dollar fifty vs the burt&#x27;s 4/pack is beyond well-worth it. I just wish they had the 10 or 20 pack on Amazon! :| 5/5 regardless!</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this more, but it goes on gritty.  Seems to subside after a few minutes and I do like the chapstick in all other measures!</li>
    <li> Nice Lip Balm to have. I have tried many lip product and this is the best so far.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Great lip balm!!! Texture is right, smell is so nice, not too &amp;#34;pepperminty&amp;#34; like those lip balms that make your lips kind of &amp;#34;cold&amp;#34;. The flavor is also great, it&#x27;s sweet!!! I just love these lip balms and my kids can use them too.</li>
    <li> excellent lip balm, very good moisturizing for this time of the year. I love the product.</li>
    <li> Super soft lips, super soothing  and minty, not overly greasy just perfect moisture</li>
    <li> Great lip balm!  It&#x27;s minty and gives your lips a pleasant tingle, keeps them from cracking but also seems to do a good job helping them heal if they&#x27;re already cracked.  Covers my needs, I&#x27;ll be buying it again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. I&#x27;ve been a die-hard Burt&#x27;s Bees user for about 15 years, but I have had reservations about continuing to support this company after it was purchased by Clorox.  I decided to try these lip balms as an alternative, and they are great!  Smooth and less waxy than Burts, wonderful natural ingredients, and I can feel good about supporting a small business.  I&#x27;m definitely interested in trying more products from Beauty by Earth in the future.</li>
    <li> Awesome product &amp; great customer service! This lip balm smells and tastes delicious &amp; getting 4 in the package is such a great deal for the price. This small, family run business is a wonderful company &amp; I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> This product stays on longer and is quite minty!  Very nice!</li>
    <li> Excellent product with a long lasting flavor that doesn&#x27;t feel heavy...and best of all doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips so you have to apply it 9943728347923 times a day like other inferior products. Buy this stuff!</li>
    <li> I like this better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  It does the job just fine.</li>
    <li> The Lip Balm is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;It does not get sticky or greasy, and lasts for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The mint flavor is pleasant and refreshing!&lt;br /&gt;When I got the product I was a little upset with the size, but the quality is very good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just used this for a week but so far I&#x27;m happy with it and it seems to be helping my dry lips.</li>
    <li> I use this less frequently than any other chapstick because of how moisturizing it is! Great product.</li>
    <li> It is very nice! It helped healed my chapped lips! I will definitely buy more!</li>
    <li> The package is nice and the smell is good.</li>
    <li> I am sensitive to most lip balms, but this one has been soothing and gentle. Great deal too!</li>
    <li> I must say I have been experimenting with lip balms out of the usual &amp;#34;chapstick&amp;#34; brand for a little bit now an have been ever so delighted with how superior these all natural lip balms are. Beauty by earth is fantastic, and for the money, you cannot beat it! To be honest it took a couple of days for my lips to get used to it, as in I would have to reapply more often that usual, but after a couple of days the stuff works amazing and come on...who doesnt love soft, healthy, minty lips! Great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a lip balm addict for years and have tried everything else, but nothing lasted, until now. This balm lasts and doesn&#x27;t make me feel the urge to reapply constantly.  Delivery was as promised and the Seller&#x27;s follow up has been terrific. Very glad I tried it and this will be my new lip balm.</li>
    <li> This has a great tasting peppermint taste but it&#x27;s not overwhelming either.  Just what we needed to get us through these Wisconsin winters...and our Caribbean cruise in December!</li>
    <li> This lip balm is great!  It moisturizes my lips and it tastes good too!  I also don&#x27;t need to put it on all day as it stays on.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Very moisturizing and I absolutely love the peppermint scent. Not too overpowering though which is always a plus since it is right under your nose. Love that is so natural too!</li>
    <li> Product came on time! I Will be giving this as a Christmas gift this year, so hopefully they like it! Like how it has coconut oil in it.</li>
    <li> This is a superior product.  It has healed my severely chapped lips in a few days.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> The first thing to note is the great flavor. It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does apply slightly oily, which I don&#x27;t like. However, that&#x27;s of no fault to the product since its just a personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It applies evenly too, which is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of effectiveness, I believe it works, but the real test will be during the winter months, so I can&#x27;t specify how great it works, or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can afford the product, I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> Every winter, without fail, I get horribly dry, cracked lips.. They split at the corners and bleed if i fail to keep them under control. I have tried every lip treatment imaginable;  Neosporin, Aquaphor, Blistex, Nivea, Neutrogena, Burt&#x27;s Bees.. You name it.  This is the first one that WORKS.  When you put it on it doesn&#x27;t feel very moisturizing, but I could tell the difference after within a few hours of the first application.  I have now been using it roughly twice a day for about a week now and I have nice silky soft man lips.  And speaking of which, it doesn&#x27;t look like there&#x27;s anything on your lips, which as a guy makes it much less awkward to wear during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be passing along a tube to my parents and another to my sister who deal with the same rough lip situation as I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic product folks.  Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm! The peppermint flavor is really nice and doesn&#x27;t taste or feel waxy.  Even my boyfriend likes it :)  Definitely a great value and product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Really helps heals chapped lips.  it is the only thing I use now.</li>
    <li> I love this product it goes on so nice and smooth .  I give some to co workers who love it as well . Thanks for a nice natural product that you can share with friends.</li>
    <li> the lip balm itself is good but the shipping is crazy sooo sooo slow!!</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product and this company! I have nothing bad to say about it.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Honestly I like it better than burst bees original lip balm, I have used them for years.&lt;br /&gt;Glad to have found this one.</li>
    <li> Leaves lips smooth and smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR PROVIDING AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.</li>
    <li> Love the lip balm! It&#x27;s creamy and smooth!  It&#x27;s also great knowing that it&#x27;s all natural and good for your skin. It arrived fast, well packaged and the seller goes the extra mile to pleasel!!</li>
    <li> Love this. Very smooth going on, smells nice, and does what a lip balm is supposed to do. I threw out several old lip balms from other companies because they had either parabens or other chemicals that were harmful.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> We are all trying to be healthier and our lips are important.  This lip balm works great, tastes great and is part of my daily routine for feeling good.</li>
    <li> I have been using Carmex for years. The Carmex lip balm I have has petroleum ingredient in it but it did a good job from keeping my lips for chapping. I put Carmex on every night before bed and in the morning when I wash my face, I get a layer of stuff from my lips. I am not sure if it&#x27;s the dried skin from my lips or it&#x27;s the dried Carmex. I didn&#x27;t really look into it since I thought Carmex did it&#x27;s job from keep my lips chapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I later decided to research online and realized petroleum in lip balms causes acnes around the lips of people with oily skin since it clogs the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this Beauty by Earth lip balm has such a high rating on Amazon, I decided to give it a shot. After the first night I used it, I didn&#x27;t wake up with a layer of stuff coming off my lips yet it kept my lips moisturized for the whole night. This lip balm has a light peppermint smell and taste sweet. I don&#x27;t like licking my lips so the sweetness doesn&#x27;t bother me. So far, I really like this lip balm because it calms my lips without feeling waxy.</li>
    <li> Really like this product and will order it again.  The price is excellent, and the delivery was on time.</li>
    <li> I like it much better than Burt&#x27;s Bees... it has more &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; and lasts longer on the lip!</li>
    <li> I ordered this peppermint flavor along with the set of 4 fruity flavors.&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time trying this product line.&lt;br /&gt;Tastes fresh and feels smooth on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;Have also passed them out to my daughter and a friend to try.&lt;br /&gt;We all enjoy this new lip product.</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm. I&#x27;ve ordered two boxes of this and I will order more when I run out. It&#x27;s all natural and tastes really great. Order some for yourself. you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> As a balm, it&#x27;s good enough. I prefer more hydro type myself though.</li>
    <li> very moisturizing and minty.</li>
    <li> I have been a dedicated Carmex user for years. I use lip balm throughout the day and also at night. The past year it just hasn&#x27;t been working well for me, I&#x27;d be using it 100 times throughout the day and I&#x27;d wake up in the mornings with dry lips. After trying EOS and straight Vaseline(at night) on my lips I started looking around for something different and I found this.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I haven&#x27;t been using this for weeks yet. So this isn&#x27;t a extended use review.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was the strong peppermint smell; although it&#x27;s not overwhelming. It has a similar consistency to Carmex, possibly a tiny bit thinner but not very noticeable. When you first put it on you get a minty fresh tingling and it tastes like candy canes, but better. The taste doesn&#x27;t stick around forever; which is fine by me or I&#x27;d be licking my lips all day.&lt;br /&gt;As far as using it when I go to bed. So far so good, I wake up with my lips feeling decently hydrated. So hopefully it continues to work well after using it for an extended period. I&#x27;ll try and update this in a few months.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is a great deal, and is very moisturizing. It glides on smoothly and the peppermint flavor is energizing. I like this lip blam because it does not contain any chemicals.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my Mom... she loved it!  She is always looking for the best lip moisturizer and she said she could tell a difference the day after she started using it.  I&#x27;m sure we will be buying more!</li>
    <li> The product description states, &amp;#34;Moisturizes your lips like nothing else you have tried before.&amp;#34;  They mean it!  It really does moisturize my lips like nothing else I&#x27;ve tried, and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried so many.  All the others are disappointing and many of them actually make my lips drier.  This one doesn&#x27;t.  It moisturizes and lasts, even through eating and drinking, so I&#x27;m not constantly applying it like other brands.  It will probably take a while to use up all four tubes, but when I do, I will certainly order more.</li>
    <li> Nice smooth lipbaum that tastes great!</li>
    <li> Wear alone or under lipstick to help severely chapped lips. Even my 16 year old son likes it; the peppermint is not too much.</li>
    <li> Great lip balm!  Makes my lips feel smooth and smells great.  Glad to get this right when the weather is turning cold!</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm. It is a great peppermint flavor, but not so much that it burns like other lip balms I&#x27;ve tried. It feels great on my lips and doesn&#x27;t have a waxy taste at all. I&#x27;m switching to this after using Burts Bees for a long time.</li>
    <li> I used to be a dedicated ChapStick user for years, in NY with the cold weather and wind it&#x27;s almost impossible with out a petroleum product covering your lips to protect them. Women have lipstick, but even then who knows what&#x27;s really in it. I question those ingredients. But for guys, it&#x27;s chapstick or lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since Pfizer bought the brand from Wyeth it seem every year they keep changing the formula more and more. It&#x27;s no longer what it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have been trying more nature friendly brands a go. I personally have been using BbE new lip balm the last month or so and I prefer it over ChapStick. The flavor is better, it glides a bit better onto my lips and my girlfriend prefers it as well :) I guess it&#x27;s a double win!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this balm definitely a repeat customer. Just please don&#x27;t change your formula to save a buck!!!</li>
    <li> Nice moisturization for the lips. I also like the peppermint sensation. Lol My hubby likes it also.</li>
    <li> I got the mint flavor- nice natural mint flavour, very smooth to go on and really moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product</li>
    <li> I love products with no hidden unnatural ingredients. This lip balm is no exception- works very well and with beeswax, vitamin E, shea butter.. all the good stuff. i would recommend to a friend- in fact, I did give a couple away!</li>
    <li> I received my product on time and was very satisfied.  The peppermint is not overbearing and the slip is good but not to slippery.  I have been experiencing very very dry cracked lips.  after a day of using this product I see a difference.  I will purchase again...</li>
    <li> Quality is better. Little expensive compare to other lip balm.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Very moisturizing. Love the packaging and that it doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals. :)</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Was a hit as stocking stuffer for my girls.</li>
    <li> I really love this product because it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that works for me!  I&#x27;ve tried many, many brands and this stuff works.</li>
    <li> I love all their products and this one is exceptional. It feels clean and refreshing. It is the best balm I&#x27;ve ever used, and the peppermint is now my favorite flavor. I shared one with my mom and a friend, and they love it too. We&#x27;ve thrown out the rest of the balms we had and are solely Beauty by Earth people.</li>
    <li> The product has been shipped very fast and great seller service. As for the product itself - not sure if I like it - it is just OK. The consistency of the lip balm is very hard and it makes several attempts to put proper layer on your lips.  And unfortunately there is too much of peppermint (not just the smell, but inside the product) - so it causes burning sensation on your lips for a while and feels dry, instead of getting moisture &amp; creamy feeling. In overall by ingredients listed - should be a good product. Probably not just to my taste. I still will try to use it.</li>
    <li> I am really loving this lip balm - it goes on smoothly, and is full of quality ingredients. Very moisturizing!! This is my new fave. I&#x27;m looking forward to trying more products from this company.</li>
    <li> WHAT AN AMAZING PRODUCT!!!!! I LOVE IT!!! I TOTALLY RECOMMEND IT!!!! MAKES YOUR LIP REALLY SMOOTH! VERY SATISFIED WITH THE QUALITY!!!</li>
    <li> Loved, loved, loved the balm!</li>
    <li> I ordered this lip balm as I am switching products to natural ingredients.  Wow, this one feels smooth on the lip, yet light, contrary to Burt Bee natural lip balm&#x27;s waxy &amp; tacky feel on the lip.  I threw all my other lip balms (6 in total) out and shall be using this.</li>
    <li> It is very smooth and lasts quite a long time, the only thing I don&#x27;t really like is that&#x27;s it tastes very sweet. But overall a very good lip balm.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is perfect for me because I have a problem with chapped lips and sensitivity... it is difficult for me to find a lip balm that moisturizes and soothes my itchy and dry lips. Plus it tastes amazing and I love mint!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent lip balm but I think I prefer Neutrogena Natural</li>
    <li> Perfect for my lips! Love it&#x27;s texture, very smooth and emollient. The peppermint smell is lovely. I am kind of addicted already and I just got it a few days ago!</li>
    <li> This company is a five star.  They gifted me 4 peppermint lip balms.  I like to use the balm at night and in the morning...my lips are soft and moist. I Iove their products as they do as they are described and love that they are a small company as they take pride in their products and take such good.care of their customers.  Thanks Beauty by Earth!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite chap sticks. I have a problem with regular cheap chap stick that just makes my lips more dry after a little while. I recently moved to Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Beeswax, and while it solved the problem of making my lips more dry unless I kept using it a lot.. it was very thick and you could feel it on your lips too much. So I decided to try Beauty by Earth cause of the reviews on here, and it turns out its the best of both worlds. The only thing I don&#x27;t care for too much is how long the peppermint taste stays on your lips, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that&#x27;s a downfall and more a personal preference so I didn&#x27;t deduct points for it. The taste isnt chemically and not bad at all, just makes me want to lick my lips more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After almost a year of using this, I find that it can be a little greasy at times when its kept in warmer rooms. I also find that it is one of the best things to avoid making chapped lips worse, keeps on long, and most comfortable... I do find that it takes a couple days longer to &amp;#34;solve&amp;#34; the problem. Rather be comfortable and last longer though, than to cure the problem quicker I guess!</li>
    <li> This lip balm is incredible!  It feels amazing on my lips.  It has the perfect consistency - and it lasts!!  That is what is so amazing.  Most lip balms seem to dissipate minutes after you apply it... Not this one!  My lips stay completely moisturized all night. I also love that it is made with amazing all natural ingredients...I never have to worry about some nefarious chemical entering my body.  I am so happy I found this product!!</li>
    <li> The best chap stick I&#x27;ve used. Sounds funny to be picky with chap stick but for me it is important to get the best possible. I have bigger than usual lips so its important to take care of them. One application usually lasts about 2 -3 hours for me. (Unless I am eating) This is unusual for me. I can sometimes find myself reapplying every 30 min with other chap sticks. Especially with bad weather. (Extremely hot, Extremely Cold or windy.) The ingredients are all natural. Really is an awesome product.</li>
    <li> I can not give this product a full review just yet.  I have given the 4 stars because of what I have read and the reviews. This is a Christmas gift so the full review will have to come later.  However, this was a desired item on my daughter-in-law&#x27;s wish list which tells me it is a product she already knows she likes.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love! This product itself tastes so good. You get a tingly sensation from the all natural mint flavor. So refreshing and hydrating to my winter dried lips. My fiance loves when I wear it as well because my kisses are minty and refreshing! It&#x27;s almost like a breath mint and lip balm in one! He loves this product as well. I have given some out as gifts and they wanted to know where I bought it because they liked it so much. Never have I ever found such a great hydrating and minty tingly lip balm. I will never buy a different kind again!</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm. I get chapped lips frequently and I feel like I have tried just about everything from Aquafor to EOS to Burts Bees to Chapstick. I love that this works well, I don&#x27;t have to reapply it as frequently as I would find my self reapplying others. I also love that it&#x27;s natural. Bonus - it&#x27;s quite economical (and I like the minty taste).&lt;br /&gt;I also like that buying it supports a small business (that works through Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy more! Try it!!!</li>
    <li> Leaves my dry lips soft again with a wonderful hint of mint. These were a great hit in our goodie bags. Love these!</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm! Comes nicely packed and received a nice follow up email from the manufacturer after I purchased the product. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Disappointed.  I like Burts Bees (original formula) better.  Did not feel like the Beauty by Earth product is as long lasting and didn&#x27;t care for the fact that has a sweet flavor to it.  When lip balm is flavored, I am more inclined to lick it off.</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm. Everything about it is wonderful. I love peppermint but it&#x27;s hard to find a lip balm that has enough peppermint in it. This balm nails it. It is also super moisturizing. My lips were super dry and my daughter&#x27;s were chapped because of below zero temps and now our lips are healthy and moisturized. Pretty awesome. The price is pretty amazing too for such a great product that&#x27;s all natural.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time finding a chap stick that works well for me, but this stuff is great. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and my lips are already softer. Super happy with it!</li>
    <li> I really do like this product smells wonderful and it goes on smoothly and so far seems to really work</li>
    <li> These bring joy to all that use them , I give them out at my moms musing home and the look of joy on the women&#x27;s face is so sweet. Hope you guys relies the happiness your product brings to these ladies</li>
    <li> I was excited when I received this box of lip balm. I thought it was going to be great because of all these 5 star reviews and because it&#x27;s all natural.. I had high expectations and they were NOT met. I&#x27;ve been using these for about a week, I apply it often since my lips lose moisture a lot especially in the winter, and they seemed to help at first but then I noticed my lips were flaky due to this product. Suffice to say I was not pleased. The idea of this  is great (all natural + peppermint), but something obviously went wrong along the way.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is my favorite.  I live in northern Utah so especially in the winter, my dry lips become a big problem for me.  With other balms, I had to apply constantly throughout the day and it would only temporarily help with the dryness but didn&#x27;t seem to actually help unless the balm was on at that minute.  Many balms actually dried my lips out more.  I tried this balm and it didn&#x27;t dry my lips out at all and they never became chapped again once since I started using it.  I only need to apply it about 2 times a day.  It seems to help replenish my lips natural oils and make my skin more healthy.  It has a nice texture that isn&#x27;t sticky and has a nice very mild scent.</li>
    <li> Really like this lip balm! great texture: silky but firm enough so it doesn&#x27;t get all over the place. Peppermint isn&#x27;t obnoxious.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice product. It has a pleasant smell that is strong without being overwhelming and it goes on really smooth. It&#x27;s VERY dry where I live and this makes my lips feel fantastic.</li>
    <li> Exceptional at softening lips.</li>
    <li> Just got it.  Don&#x27;t care how it works as I had to take an exact-o knife to cut the supposed seal off just to get it open.  If you have enough light and maybe a magnifying glass you&#x27;ll be able to see the supposed seal that has to come off.  But, it doesn&#x27;t come off in one piece.  It peals off in shreds!!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this lip balm.  Not drying at all!  Great purchase and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is the most fabulous lip balm I have ever purchased. They smell great, work great, and my Hudband loves the also! I must use a hydrating balm all the time&amp;#34; it is so moisturizing with out being sticky. It just wish you had one with SPF. THANK YOU FOR YOUR WONDERFUL PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Is not so good as the 5 ***** reviews describe. Is the same quality, as a dollar store lip balm. Wait a minute...! I prefer buying a lip balm again at the dollar store.</li>
    <li> BABY Smooth!! I have chopped lips and constantly cracking, i bought this product and i put it on at night, the next morning it was still on my lips and my lips felt amazing and nourished. They felt so hydrated and super smooth. When i applied it, it went on like butter. The ONLY problem is after i stopped applying it it left like a weird tingling sensation on my lips. It feels like there is still a layer of something on my lips, but i know its not the chopstick, but im guessing thats why its beeswax. overall great product</li>
    <li> This lip balm is great.its smells delicious and soft.i try many kind of lio balm from the store,but never work on my very dry lips.this one did.i will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this. It feels amazing. It tastes really Good. And you can regift it easily.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Right as my package arrived, I used it on my lips. I immediately went outside in the freezing cold, because I had errands to run and this product withstood the dry air and wind blowing in my face. My lips were not chapped as they used to be. So far I have been using it for the past couple days and it has been great! I always use it before I put on my lip gloss now. My lips are no longer chapped. I&#x27;m going to say goodbye to my EOS products that I was using before since they aren&#x27;t as nice as this! My only concern with this product are the ingredients. Some of the ingredients don&#x27;t seem natural as the company claims. For example, &amp;#34;lanolin&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34;.... &amp;#34;Flavor&amp;#34; is a very generic word and some product users may be worried about this ingredient.</li>
    <li> I have been a Burt&#x27;s Beeswax Lip Balm user for over a decade. As of late, I&#x27;ve found that Burt&#x27;s balm has become very grainy (or perhaps it was just the pack I purchased that week) on application, which doesn&#x27;t work well with the light lipglosses that I use. I purchased this pack in the hopes that a natural balm with less additives would be less of a hassle ... I was right! Whereas I was constantly reapplying Burt&#x27;s balm throughout the day, nearly every half hour to hour, this balm is truly long-lasting. Water bottle guzzling aside, its stays on and moisturizes for several hours. I began using the balm the night I received it and I have to say there is a marked difference in the feel and &#x27;naked&#x27; look of my lips. The mint flavor isn&#x27;t overwhelming, nor is its taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ve won over a new customer!</li>
    <li> I enjoy the product. It&#x27;s very soothing on the lips and has a cooling sensation. It moisturizer &amp; softens the lips giving it&#x27;s light gloss.</li>
    <li> Best lip moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting &amp; provides lots of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm! taste and feels great on your lips, makes them nice and soft. I will definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> Great stuff! The most amazing thing about this lip balm is it stays on much longer than other products. It also has a really refreshing minty flavor and &amp;#34;zest&amp;#34; to it that lingers nicely on your lips! A little bit goes a long way which means it will last longer too which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Beauty by Earth!</li>
    <li> This lip balm goes on very smoothly (unlike most natural lip balms). There is not a whole lot of flavor (which I like) but it smells amazing! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is terrific stuff! The ingredients are all natural, but this product is also notable for what it DOESN&#x27;T contain: no mineral oil and, most importantly, no petroleum (that stuff that just slides around on the surface of your lips without actually seeming to do anything for them). It smells nice with a light peppermint touch and is serious therapy for any dry-lips sufferer. Recommended!</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm I have ever tried. I was a bit iffy when I bought it and how it would feel against my lips but I honestly could not have ordered a better lip balm. your lips tingle when you put it on but its a good tingle and when you sit under air or air hits your lips your lips feel cold in a good way though. It is so fresh and you can&#x27;t even tell you have anything on your lips. Best product for anyone who is looking for an amazing lip balm.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used! The only problem I have is keeping my family members from taking it!</li>
    <li> This was given as a Christmas gift and seems to be much enjoyed.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Just as described.</li>
    <li> Smells good and works well. Better than eos. I use this before i go to bed it ggets moist the next day.</li>
    <li> The service by the sellers was excellent. The product was elegantly packaged. I felt good that all ingredients were natural. The peppermint or vanilla scent is pleasing. The product applied smoothly. It is better than most (and I have tried a multitude) I would rate the lip balm a 3 out of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> We got these as a gift and they&#x27;re super silky as my wife would say. She doesn&#x27;t usually like anything peppermint at all, not even gum that tastes minty, but this she was surprised about was super soft. Ended up getting the flavored kind since she likes other flavors better so those she loves more, but if you like silky and soft chapstick and also minty stuff, this is the way to go.</li>
    <li> Like everybody said, this lip balm is great.  My tight peeling lips are repairing and I need it less often (within the first week of using) as they normalize.  I like how this glides on silky smooth and is light.  The sweet flavor is nice and enjoyable, but I have to have self control not to lick it - that is why I like the peppermint most (compared to the flavored 4 pack)  - it&#x27;s less to think about.  But the flavored 4 pack is still the same great formula, its fun for a change and its great for kids.</li>
    <li> I usually use EOS sweet mint. The mint Beauty by Earth LIP BALM has a stronger mint smell and cooling sensation. However, it&#x27;s a bit too soft for my liking when I put it on and becomes a  tad bit messy. Though this could just be a personal preference.</li>
    <li> I will just say that out of the four lip balms,  one is at my desk at work,  one in my every day purse,  one at my work desk at home and the last one on my vanity set.  I love the fact that this is sweet and has a tingling feeling after you apply it,  a little goes a long way and more importantly,  it lasts!!!!  Love them so far!</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews I hoped this would be a balm I would not have to use so often, but it tastes so good you end up licking it off and then your lips dry out. Not the purpose of the stuff. It is nice stuff though.</li>
    <li> This is really good stuff. Normally, I have used Chapstick, Burt&#x27;s Bees, or Blistex, and I like this more. It seems to last a long time, and the price is great. As far as texture, flavor, etc., it kind of reminds me of a mix between Burt&#x27;s Bees and original Chapstick. If you&#x27;ve never tried it and you&#x27;re considering ordering, I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lip balm after watching a few YouTube videos on it. Since they come with 4, I gave one to my sister and mother. Both my sister and I agreed that it goes on smooth and stays longer than the EOS that we have. We agreed that we don&#x27;t need to re-apply as much during the day. My mother hasn&#x27;t tried it. Overall, we are very satisfied with this lip balm!</li>
    <li> Overall I like this lip balm. It feels smooth going on and lasted on my lips for a while. With all natural ingredients and no chemicals I am happy to use this product knowing it is good for my body. I really avoided using most chapsticks or lip balms because they have a chemical taste and sticky feel. This lip balm has none of that for me! The only reason I am giving 4 stars and not 5 is because the peppermint flavor leaves a cool feeling on my lips which isn&#x27;t really my cup of tea usually. However I may like it more during the hotter months. Some people may like that feeling so I think it&#x27;s good to know. The &#x27;cool&#x27; feeling lasted for about 20 mins on my lips and then was gone but I still felt that lip balm on my lips so I know it is still doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> I was using Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm for a long time....But this one is great...very soft and works...I a thinking try their other products also.....</li>
    <li> I am a bit of a lip balm junkie.  I hate when my lips feel at all dry.  This stuff is awesome.  It tastes amazing and makes your lips sooooooo soft for a long period of time.  best thing, I kissed my fianc&amp;eacute; and he said &amp;#34;Wow you taste amazing!&amp;#34;  I am obsessed with these lip balms!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite lip balm. I am one who ALWAYS has some chapstick in my pocket. time and time again my friends tell me that the cheap Chapstick is addicting and actually dries out your lips so you constantly have to re-apply. this is the first organic lip balm i have used. without a doubt you can tell the difference. it actually moisturizes and the taste and feel is great. from day one i was hooked. This company also makes an argon oil which i am going to check out. http://www.amazon.com/Earth-Certified-Organic-Highest-Quality/dp/B00I134Y82/ie&#x3D;UTF8?m&#x3D;A17119QUPKBK8A&amp;keywords&#x3D;argan+oil</li>
    <li> I love it!  stays on and feels tingley, came fast</li>
    <li> Super smooth and feels really good on my lips. Love Beauty by Earth&#x27;s products. They pick only the highest quality stuff</li>
    <li> I originally tried this product when it came free with their Argan Oil that i bought. I now have this Chapstick everywhere throughout the house, in the car, my bag, etc. It&#x27;s smooth, lasts long and makes my lips look nice and plump without drying them out. A little goes a long way with this, so I&#x27;ve officially made the switch to Beauty by Earth Lip Balm from my 10 year relationship with berts bees.</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm.  I normally use Sugar brand lip balm but it&#x27;s very expensive.  A friend recommended this and I like it as much, if not more that the Sugar brand.  The peppermint lightly tingles my lips and feels refreshing.</li>
    <li> The only lip balm I&#x27;ll use!  If it&#x27;s going on your body, it&#x27;s getting into your system and we don&#x27;t need any more toxins.  Plus, it is fun to use because of the pleasant taste.  Pretty much stopped using lipstick.</li>
    <li> Great product, it works well and has a great flavor....I will be purchasing it again</li>
    <li> Feels nice on my lips.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is healing without being waxy.  The peppermint is rejuvenating on my lips.  My granddaughter (5 years old) took one of mine away because she loved it so much, and I trusted the ingredients for her use.  I keep one beside my bed, in my desk at work and in my purse.  Wonderful stuff!</li>
    <li> I was looking for an all natural lip balm that would actually moisturize and nourish my lips rather than just coating them with a waxy feel.  Research and good reviews brought me to Best Lip Balm&#x27;s 100% natural lip care.  I love the fact that the balm itself is not too heavy so that my lips don&#x27;t feel like they are weighed down, and that the application lasts.  I have used other balms where fifteen to twenty minutes after application you feel like you never used anything.  With Best Balm, my lips feel moist several hours later and they are smooth, so that I know actual nourishment has taken place; no more of that after-balm wrinkly lip look and feel. To top it off, Best Lip Balm has a nice minty (not waxy) scent, so you enjoy the scent of the product as much as the effectiveness of it.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is great. I work as a doula and always carry extra to give to my laboring mommas. They are always so grateful!</li>
    <li> Wonderful lip balm! Best I&#x27;ve ever owned. Very long lasting and feels good on the lips.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm I have tried.  I am in love with this lip balm.  It doesn&#x27;t make your lips feel slick, greasy, tacky or sticky but instead moisturized and very comfortable.  The balm has a slight mint scent and mint-like taste, which I like a lot.  It is not overwhelming, but it is just right.  It glides on smoothly, leaving lips soft and smooth.  The all natural ingredients just add to the great qualities of this product.  I enjoy having the four pack and it makes me feel good about giving it to my children to use being that is 100% natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because another reviewer said it was better than Burt&#x27;s Bees (which is what I&#x27;ve been using).  Well, BEST LIP BALM is definitely better than Burt&#x27;s.  This is a winner!!!</li>
    <li> Good natural lip balm. Like it</li>
    <li> I saw that this lip balm said it was the best lip balm which almost turned me off from buying it only because I have bought things that claim to be the best and it is far from it. Well, that is not the case with this lip balm. I LOVE IT!!! It&#x27;s inexpensive for four of them and I love the way it feels on my lips. My husband even likes it because it is not tinted or have a girly scent. It reminds me of a very popular peppermint lip balm (hint: bees). Which I love that lip balm but sometimes it is nice to find something else that is close. This isn&#x27;t as thick as the other lip balm mentioned. It is thick in the right way though, it stays put. I love that I don&#x27;t have to reapply it over and over but I do anyways because I love the way it smells and feels. I got these because I wanted new lip balm for my hospital bag and diaper bag (I am due in a month) so, I wanted something simple. These are great and I will buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. Great customer service and ownership who cares. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Nice, smooth lip balm. Unfortunately it has no SPF though which will limit my use of this.</li>
    <li> great lip balm. love that there&#x27;s no chemicals or cheap fillers in it.</li>
    <li> Very smooth and tastes good. Not as overpowering as BB.</li>
    <li> Great and doesn&#x27;t feel like other petroleum-based lip balms. Totally green and natural!</li>
    <li> love it nice aroma fills great on my lips will I buy more yes fast reponds</li>
    <li> I recently found this Chapstick while searching for an all natural option. I am soo happy that I purchased this! I absolutely love everything about it. It makes my lips feel silky smooth and it helped kick my blistex addiction! I&#x27;ll never go back!</li>
    <li> The whole pack included four lip balms, I gave two to my husband. We both loved it! It tastes a bit sweet, reminded me the &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; of nature! I strongly recommend this product to every one who love themselves, and those who you love!</li>
    <li> Love the minty flavor.  I feel good putting something natural on my lips.</li>
    <li> In the dry climate I live in,  I need to use something on my lips, especially outdoors.  I have been trying out this lip balm when&lt;br /&gt;out hiking all day,  and I like it.  It lasts longer than other products I have,  and my lips are more protected from dryness.  I like the peppermint flavor,  and knowing that&lt;br /&gt;this is pure beeswax.  This is a good one!</li>
    <li> I wanted to switch to a more natural and safe alternative to chap sticks, so I thought I would try this one. When I first tried this, I found myself needing to use it more often than the regular chap sticks. I wondered if this was not as good as the ones made with questionable ingredients or was it due to the changeover of products. I decided to wait it out to the second week and found out that these work just as good or better than the non natural ingredient chap sticks and I only needed to use it the same amount as the others after that first week. I am very pleased with this chap stick and really feel the menthol ingredient works fast to heal my lips.</li>
    <li> Excellent lip balm. Light and effective. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Great lip balm! Better and cheaper than Burt&#x27;s Bees! I keep it on me all day long!</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm I have ever used.  After having tried numerous ones from the very expensive to very reasonable category, this is the one that is most effective for me.  Very happy to have purchased it (based on the reviews from Amazon).</li>
    <li> Tastes better than Carmex but I find very frequent reapplication of this product is needed. Will not repurchase and do not recommend. The hunt continues.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I was willing to get used to the scent, and the taste wasn&#x27;t too bad, but the best way I test anything is putting it on overnight and seeing how my lips feel in the morning. I woke up with a slight burning feeling, and cracked lips after wearing this all night. By comparison, if I used regular vaseline, my lips feel soft when I wake up (it doesn&#x27;t have the same affect during the day, unfortunately). I love the natural element, but this just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Pretty decent Chapstick. The first one I opened was weird and grainy. But the next one was smooth and nice. Not super oily. Lightweight.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing lip balm. It leaves a wonderful peppermint taste on your lips.</li>
    <li> I actually really love this Chapstick. It has coconut oil in it so it is very creamy and hydrating but it doesn&#x27;t leave the sticky residue that most leave. The peppermint is a nice relaxing touch. It also doesn&#x27;t taste bad if you get some in your mouth. I also really like that it comes in a 4 pack as I switch purses a lot and tend to loose my chapsticks before I finish them.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. I have lip balms everywhere all the time. This one smells nice, feels nice, and I actually don&#x27;t even need it as often. Very nice natural product. Came in nice packaging also.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is wonderful. It has a great texture, natural scent and made my lips feel moist and hydrated. Some lip balms are too hard, others have too much liquid and &amp;#34;fall of&amp;#34; my lips, but this one was perfect. I recommend it to all us lipbalm / chapstick lovers.</li>
    <li> I love this balm, the way it feels and am confident it is healthy without the weird sounding additives you find in so many products. The price was very reasonable, too.</li>
    <li> The peppermint adds a nice tingle.</li>
    <li> Love it! My husband used to buy Burt&#x27;s Bees and I used Badger lip balm. This lip balm is the love child of those two--minty but goes on just right. It actually tastes great, too. We&#x27;ve found our new lip balm!</li>
    <li> No miracles, but I really like. Pretty nice taste, moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this yummy lip balm!!! It feel so luxurious and tastes amazing. My daughter and I are very picky about lip balms and we both love Beauty by Earth. It&#x27;s slips on so nicely and lasts. There&#x27;s no other lip balm I&#x27;ll ever use!</li>
    <li> These cheapies worked way better than other expensive brands I have tried in the past like Burt&#x27;s Bees, Jack Black and Maybeline (the worst).</li>
    <li> Best Chapstick! I love that this is made with all natural ingredients, the peppermint flavor is perfect and leaves me feeling fresh! Very happy! Great customer service too!</li>
    <li> This causes my lips to dry out requiring me to use it often, but never feeling fully moisturized.  I Love the peppermint and the tingle, but my lips shouldn&#x27;t hurt after using it.  Also, it&#x27;s not smooth.  It creates a tacky sticky feeling on my lips.  After about an hour or so of the application, I can feel these bumps on my lips from the chapstick.  It&#x27;s odd.  I do not recommend this product.  I was really disappointed.</li>
    <li> Initially, when I put this on, it is buttery wonderful. After the first application, it is grainy. So it is not comfortable to apply. I like that it is organic, cruelty free, etcetcetc, but hesitate to apply because of the grains in there. They do go away, it just is unpleasant to put on my lips. I will go back to EOS.</li>
    <li> This is a nice lip balm, very minty! It takes a few seconds to warm it up on your lips but when it does, it goes thick and lasts a long time. Excellent hydration.. I use lip balm every night (live in the desert) and wake up with my lips still feeling moisturized. Recommended!</li>
    <li> I wear lip balm practically 24 hours a day. I wear different brands and SPF15 and above when out in the sun. I researched for a few weeks before buying this product. I was looking for a product without a lot of toxins because I know I am ingesting quite a bit through lip licking or beverage drinking. I ended up with this Beauty by Earth, comes in a four pack, I keep them everywhere, next to the bed, on the computer desk, in the bathroom, in my pocket. Has a nice peppermint flavor without overpowering. Mild tingle with smooth silky protection that lasts hours.&lt;br /&gt;It is not an SPF lip balm but it&#x27;s my choice when not in the sun. They have other flavors I will be willing to try. Fantastic ingredient list, recyclable packaging.</li>
    <li> Great product! And a 4 pack! They keep my lips organically hydrated!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Best natural lip balm I have tried. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great quality product!</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm!  After you use this one, you realize how bad other products are.  I&#x27;ll never go back to chap stick!</li>
    <li> My lips get chapped often. When I first tried this new chapstick I was surprised by the cool, refreshing feel to it. I guess that&#x27;s the peppermint.  It feels great and then the coolness goes away and I don&#x27;t even notice until the end of the day, when I realize it&#x27;s time to reapply! Definitely better than the average chapstick. :)</li>
    <li> This lip balm is AMAZING! Goes on so smooth and last a long time before having to re apply!</li>
    <li> A friend gave me one of these balms and I loved it so bought a pack of them. I love that there are no questionable ingredients and that the natural ingredients don&#x27;t cause my lips to peel like some other brands have.</li>
    <li> It really is lip butter.  Less ingredients and all natural.  Will definitely buy again and try another flavor.  But this all natural peppermint is mild and my new fave!!</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm!</li>
    <li> OMG! This lip balm is the best thing ever! I use recently purchased this product and use during the daytime and ayt night before retiring to bed and let me tell you...this lip balm keeps your lip moist for hours and hours and leaving a lingering peppermint feel for a long while. I can&#x27;t wait to introduce this product to my husband as he loves a good lip balm and I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s actually using the right brand lol. I don&#x27;t usually write aloit of reviews but this product as small and simple as it may be definitely does wonders to your lips. Goodbye Nivea and all those other brands and hello Beauty by Earth Peppermint! Absolutely love it!!</li>
    <li> Loved the smell. They stay longer than other lip balms. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that this would be more emollient than it is.  The mint flavor is nice, but it does not apply as smoothly as I would have liked.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Chapstick girl - but this product changed my loyalties.  REALLY great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> An excellent back-to-school gift. Soft lips for everyone!</li>
    <li> The best lip balm I have ever used. It stays on for a longer period of time than other brands. I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Better than any lip balm I have ever used. Applies easy and leaves a cool, pepperminty taste, and most importantly, it protects.</li>
    <li> I have bought a multipack from this company before. They are simply awesome. The mints tingle quite a bit and the flavors are simply yummy. This one is no different. I rarely give 5 stars in reviews so you know this is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
    <li> Like the way this goes on and the quality!</li>
    <li> Today I received your product, and I would like to say that I am so happy to have found the right lip balm for myself.My lip was so dry, I tried several different types but the result was not good too much, until getting your product, my lips become smooth over, and the makeup became more quickly and more easily.</li>
    <li> This is very good moisturizer lip balm.It is creamy, has a verylight scent, and stays on for hours.Very good for winter time</li>
    <li> Love the way this lipbalm goes on.. very smooth. I like to use as a base for my lipsticks as well so they can go on smooth and silky. It lasts a good amount on your lips. I definitely am not constantly reapplying but I always keep it close. I actually bought these for my bf who is very picky and so far I have no heard one negative comment (that means he likes it). Did I mention this is so reasonably priced. Loved that it&#x27;s all natural ingredients. Will purchase again!!</li>
    <li> Good and stay along day</li>
    <li> Really like this lip balm. Just a hint of mint, not too strong like some. Will definitely be buying some more in the future.</li>
    <li> after learning all the chemicals in regular lip balms, i switched to this. So far i am&lt;br /&gt;really happy with it and i recommand to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is quite a nice balm. A smooth consistency that goes on without being gloppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some lip balms actually dry my lips out when used daily. This is one of the few that is soothing and I find myself reaching for it again and again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed with the reviews when they stated how this kept them moisturized much longer than other chapstix. I enjoyed the mint flavor and the sleek look, however I had to keep reapplying every 30 minutes. I need a decent lip balm and this was not it.</li>
    <li> This is awesome! It last all day..</li>
    <li> This lip balm moisturizes; however, it does not last all day.  I find reapplying throughout the day is a must.  The Peppermint scent is not overwhelming.  For my personal needs, it beats Chapstick.</li>
    <li> This will be a lifetime favorite for me, it rocks it out!  I have been a Burt&#x27;s Bees fan for such a long time, but this product is much smoother.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Over the past year I developed an allergy to lipstick, lip stains and lip balms with artificial flavour and colour in it. Using them for more than a day would cause small, painful blisters on my lips. In my search for a natural product to use I came across the Beauty by Earth Lip balms and I&#x27;m so glad I did! This is an effective, natural product at a very reasonable price. I will continue to use and purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Perfectly peppermint and with none of the bad stuff!</li>
    <li> I constantly have chapped lips and this lip balm is the first to both soothe and moisturizer. I keep one in my car, one in my purse, one at my desk and one next to my bed.</li>
    <li> Wanted to really love this lip balm based on all the positive reviews but only found it to be ordinary. The peppermint flavor was not overpowering so it&#x27;s refreshing to use but the texture is very oily making its protecting and moisturizing properties minimal; constant reapplication is required to get any lasting result. Acceptable product but not at all what I was hoping for, based on the hype.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is smooth and long-lasting. I get very dry lips and rely on lip-balm throughout the day, and so far I like this better than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried. I also love that it&#x27;s made out of all-natural ingredients so I never have to worry about ingesting harmful chemicals.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice lip balm - great texture, not too thick, but reasonably long-lasting.  Good by itself overnight, or under a lipstick for a bit of color.  Nice subtle mint taste.  And also a good price - the package would be great in Christmas stockings</li>
    <li> Good product.  Smells good and don&#x27;t need to constantly re-apply.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re considering buying this, then the chances are you&#x27;ve been disappointed by many chapstick manufacturers.  The problem with me was it seemed as if all the chapstick I used was only a temporary solution.  My lips would feel great after application, but 30 minutes later I would be frantically looking for my chapstick again.  I started thinking my lips were just so dry that I needed a better quality chapstick.  I started with Vicks, then moved to Burt&#x27;s Bees, and gradually moved up the scale until I was paying $8 per tube for Jack Black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this fall I decided I needed something new and wanted something completely natural.  I quickly found this chapstick and while I had never heard of the brand, I liked all the positive reviews.  So I paid the $12 to get the chapstick.  When I ordered it, I thought I would only get 1 tube, but due to misreading the description I was pleasantly surprised that I received a total of 4!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I applied it I could tell the chapstick was high quality.  It&#x27;s hard to describe, but this chapstick seems to slightly melt the moment it touches your skin and glides across your lips completely evenly.  It was very different from any other chapstick I tried, which often ended up being applied unevenly causing it to form clumps in the corners of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also found that I am applying this chapstick much less frequently.  I&#x27;ve owned this product for nearly two weeks now, and I&#x27;ve probably applied it no more than 10 times.  Previously I would regret forgetting my chapstick at home, but with this lip balm I can go 24 hours or longer without my lips re-chapping.  I would say my lips will feel very healthy for 4-12 hours after each application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it may seem crazy to some to spend $12 on chapstick, but it is definitely worth it.  If you think it&#x27;s too pricey, just sell the 3 extra tubes to your friends for $4.</li>
    <li> very good product, smells good, lasts decent amount of time. good price</li>
    <li> I like the peppermint flavor -- it&#x27;s refreshing and moisturizing.  I would recommend this product to a friend.  thanks!</li>
    <li> The Lip Balm needs more bees wax in it.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t stay on very long because it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;too greasy.  I am disappointed in your&lt;br /&gt;product - Wish I hadn&#x27;t ordered it.</li>
    <li> I have Osler–Weber–Rendu syndrome and it is extremely important to keep my lips moist and healthy.  Recently I have been bleeding from my lips almost on a daily basis and had been coating them with vitamin E which seemed to work/help reduce the frequency of bleeding.  However, after looking at the ingredients of Lip Balm by Beauty by Earth, I found they were literally what the doctor ordered.  After receiving receiving the Lip balm, I stopped using the vitamin E, and my lips have not bled since.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is phenomenal!  I have had chapped lips for decades. I have tried everything from Chapstick, Carmex, Blistex, Vaseline, etc. I&#x27;d spend more money on beauty products and scrubs that also didn&#x27;t work. Beauty by Earth lip balm is honestly the only thing that has ever worked to keep my lips smooth. I can actually wear lipstick now and it doesn&#x27;t looked all cracked.</li>
    <li> Really like this lip balm. Perfect for adults and kids. I like that it uses natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm. The peppermint is not overpowering, but is refreshing. Moisturizes without feeling thick or waxy. I will definitely order this again!</li>
    <li> works great on dry chapped lips, also is great to find a product without soy (which I have an allergy to) which is hard to find and it really does work.  Plus I can kiss my husband now after he uses chapstick because of there being no soy!</li>
    <li> I have been using this lip balm for over a week and it has done miracles for me.  I have severely chapped lips, and I&#x27;ve tried almost all lip balms on the market, both expensive and drugstore brands, most of them would heal for a few minutes but it doesn&#x27;t last.  Beauty by Earth Lip Balm did wonders for me, especially this week when I had windburn, so bad, I couldn&#x27;t even eat!  So I applied this overnight and the following day, no more painful lips!  Love this product!</li>
    <li> Best lip balm ever!  If you get dry lips and have tried other products that did not work, look no further.  Every winter I struggle with dry lips and this is the first product I have used that actually has eliminated the issue.  Thank you Beauty by Earth!</li>
    <li> Great natural minty taste and smell. Love the all natural beeswax!  Perfect for winter.</li>
    <li> Great alternative to ChapStick which has tons of chemicals, this is all natural. It might be a mental thing or the mint flavor, but I must admit, I feel the difference in the quality of it. My lips just feel moisturized. This will be my lip balm of choice for the foreseeable future.</li>
    <li> This could be the best lip balm I have ever tried!  I have sensitive lips that dry out and peel easily.  As fall sets in every year it only gets worse, and most lip balms tend to exacerbate the peeling or even worse, the fragrance irritates them (Carmax, Vaseline, Bigelow&#x27;s, etc...).  After a few days of using this product, I can say that amazingly, this lip balm actually calms and moisturizes my lips!!  The sweet honey-like taste is also a nice complement.  You will LOVE this stuff!!  Buy it and your lips will finally stop peeling!</li>
    <li> Most lip balms make my lips peel more.  This one is smooth and soft and I noticed almost no peeling anymore.  I a m really glad I got the 4 pack because I keep lip balm everywhere.  I really like this product a lot.  A much better choice than regular, cheap lip balm.  I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had tried different products because I suffer from dry lips and none of them worked for me until I tried this product. It tastes amazing and it leaves your lips feeling soft and smooth, in my&lt;br /&gt;ppinion, it&#x27;s the best product of its kind.</li>
    <li> Love it. It tastes amazing, it smells amazing and it contains only natural ingredients. I have dry skin and live in the desert. My lips get so dry that they crack and bleed at times. It&#x27;s painful. I have found that store bought, well known products for chapped lips actually dry your lips in the long run and actually necessitate the prolonged use of the product. This product is great. It heals my lips and keeps them moist. I&#x27;m very happy. My only issue? It tastes so amazing that I find myself wanting to lick it off my lips! But, at the great value for 4 tunes, I have no problem with that. Try it. You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> It goes on very nicely and stays on longer than most lip balms. It doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped. I live in an extremely dry climate and take allergy meds so I always have chapped/dry lips. I will try to reapply more often and see if it helps more.</li>
    <li> I bought these as gifts for my girlfriends when we have our annual girls trip, of course I got one for myself.  It felt so good when I put it on and soothing.  It&#x27;s a great product</li>
    <li> Wish it had more peppermint in it...</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone and all natural,  how can you go wrong! Give it a try!!!</li>
    <li> Smells nice, feels nice, cooling mint, and really works on dryness.</li>
    <li> Similar to other reviews, I was sick of that vicious cycle most ChapStick&#x27;s cause. It seemed like everything else made my lips dryers a couple hours later. This ones the exception, and perfect!</li>
    <li> Just recieved my 4 pack in the mail, and I&#x27;m glad I got more than one! Super smooth, long lasting, and smells great!</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm - it&#x27;s so refreshing and it actually tastes good :-)&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t regret buying this.&lt;br /&gt;I have given one to my friend and she loves it too.</li>
    <li> By far my new favorite lip balm.  I love that the ingredients are natural and it feels great on.  It&#x27;s smooth and it has a delicate wonderful smell.  I will definitely be ordering again!</li>
    <li> Perfect little tubes of lip balm!  I can&#x27;t believe the difference they have made in my once (but no longer) dry and chapped lips.  The best lip balm I have ever used and will definitely reorder as needed.</li>
    <li> My husband bought me this and I really like it, it seems to last along time. Peppermint makes lips a little tingly I like that</li>
    <li> This does a great job on my dry lips, smells great too. Also doesn&#x27;t taste bad if you happen to get it in your mouth unlike other chapstick i have used. Really like the fact that it is natural too. Gave one of the sticks to a friend and she is very impressed with it as well. Good stuff, keep it up Beauty by Earth.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I love this lip balm.  I love that it is all natural ingredients and it feels smooth when applying.  The peppermint smell is not over powering but also doesn&#x27;t taste bad if you accidentally lick your lips after applying.  I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing ! I have an awful habit of picking my lips and I&#x27;m always looking for something that will leave them soft and smooth while also healing. And this stuff is it. The peppermint makes it tingle and the all natural ingredients are the best of the best. I&#x27;d recommend this stuff to everyone !</li>
    <li> This lip balm is 100% Natural &amp; Pure Beeswax. I don&#x27;t like toxic chemicals. It has a mild and pleasant scent. It&#x27;s creamy and even the packaging is cool. Made in the USA.</li>
    <li> Love the peppermint lip balm! Lips felt refreshed and smelled good too!</li>
    <li> a lovely sweet tasting lip balm, beautifully packaged...I&#x27;ll order this product many times.</li>
    <li> My lips were so chapped. I purchased this Chapstick and within two days my lips were no longer chapped.  In addition I love the freshness of the mint flavor.  I am exceptionally pleased I chose this product and will buy it in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge lip balm person and I really like this product.  Although a bit on the pricey side (much more than I usually spend on lip balm), I gave it a go due to the great reviews.  I have to say that the fact that you&#x27;re getting a natural, beeswax product from a family-owned establishment is a big motivator for me to purchase from them again in the future. I agree with other reviewers that the Peppermint flavor is refreshing, and would like to try the other flavors in the future.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Puts Chapstick, etc. to shame. I too have read that other lip balms purposely put ingredients in that make you use more of their product than necessary. My mother is a Chapstick junkie; I accuse her of eating them...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought two packs - one for her and one for me. Bingo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also like the organic nature of the balm. Go forth and multiply!</li>
    <li> Pleasant fragrance and very cooling and soothing when applied. I was pleased with this lip balm which I use all year long.</li>
    <li> Great product. Tastes great. Don&#x27;t use as much as &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I love the flavor and it does a great job healing lips.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! All natural and it works!</li>
    <li> This lip balm was fantastic! I love that it is made with all-natural ingredients, with BeesWax as # 1, which is my personal fave! It feels really smooth on my lips, which is oddly an issue I run into with some of the natural lip balms. And the smell is great too!</li>
    <li> I am a huge Burt&#x27;s Bees chap stick fan so I was skeptical trying another brand. However, these are just as good, if not better, than all of the Burt&#x27;s Bees I have tried. I love them!</li>
    <li> UPDATE: I bought this lip balm just three weeks ago and since then the price has changed from $12.00 to $19.99. If you are frugal like I am, wait for the price to drop back down. In terms of how well this product works, my lips are nearly back to normal now so it is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I bought this product it was a last ditch effort to heal my flaking, dry, chapped lips. I could literally peel the skin off them. They have never gotten this bad before and I always used over the counter products at the local store successfully. I tried Carmex, Chap Stick hydration lock, EOS lip balm and emollients such as Ponds Crema S for very dry skin. Nothing was working. Enter Beauty By Earth lip balm! I&#x27;ve been using this product for close to a week now, about 7 or 8 times per day. To my pleasant surprise, my lips are healing! I won&#x27;t say that they are completely healed because of the poor condition they were in, but they are definitely healing and the flaking is gone. I am certain that as I continue to use this product that they will heal completely. Some people have commented on the taste of the lip balm. To me, it is not strong, nor super sweet, but a pleasing mild taste. This product is also organic, which was an additional plus for me. I gave a stick to my daughter who was using EOS and she is also a convert. She said her dry (not to my extreme) lips were much softer now. Give it a try! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t read the ingredients listed on this page closely enough, which is my fault, but this lip balm contains lanolin. Lanolin is a byproduct of wool manufacturing, and so is an animal product. I have an allergy to wool and lanolin, so cannot use this. I gave it to my son, who says it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a man and was a bit embarrassed to be using something that says BEAUTY in big letters on it, but this stuff is too good. It works really well, I don&#x27;t feel compelled to constantly reapply it like other remedies for chapped lips. The peppermint taste is definitely gender neutral. The natural ingredients also make it great to use on the young kids.</li>
    <li> At first the first week i was really obsessed with this new lip balm, i thought i had finally found THE one which keeps your lips hydrated and smooth, but now im started to notice when i don&#x27;t have anything on my lips for a couple of hours they get dry asap and somehow recover harder when putting the balm back on again and kind of feel rough, so im not sure if its really that good. At the moment i wouldn&#x27;t buy another package.</li>
    <li> This lip balm works very well on chapped lips.  It keeps my lips very smooth, and the peppermint flavor is a plus.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used. It doesn&#x27;t leave me with \\&quot;rebound\\&quot; chapped lips like other products. Other products seem like they are moisturizing but only leave me with drier lips in the end. This product keeps them soft and smooth like butter and heals them from the inside out. And the plus is it&#x27;s made up of nourishing, organic ingredients. This is definitely my go-to lip balm from now on.</li>
    <li> I think I found a winner. For the past year or so I have been having issues with my lips peeling, sometimes to the point of bleeding. I tossed my Burt&#x27;s Bees (the stick form) awhile back and switched to Carmex (the vaseline like form), same issue. So then I thought perhaps I was allergic to certain brands of lipsticks (of which I am not going to give up because my lips are my best feature) because my lips would burn and the skin would puff up. I&#x27;ve been using this balm for about a week now and my lips have not peeled once. They still get what appears to be slightly chapped but it could be the lipstick still. Overall, I am happy and will be tossing everything else.</li>
    <li> Very good lip balm. Keeps your lips moistened for quite awhile.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm! Best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> Nice product,  price, arrived in a timely manner.  I wish the product box was better protected against tampering. Only one end was taped. But each individual tube is sealed. As to the balm, it went on smooth, I liked the consistency, but it tasted sweet, sweeter than I thought it needed, like candy. I would prefer no taste or neutral. I will see if they have a product better suited, to me, at a comparable price. Worth 4 stars but 5 suggests you &#x27;Love&#x27; this product. I don&#x27;t love lip balm. It&#x27;s really nice to have a product, you can use on your body, without concerns about ingredients, like, &#x27;Flavor&#x27;. But love ain&#x27;t the answer.</li>
    <li> Super smooth texture and great scent!</li>
    <li> Wow!!  It was great!  I put it on about 1 hour before bed.  I was very nice and smooth, not waxy.  I gave one to my mom and she was very happy about how smooth it was.  I then gave one to my husband.  He loved the taste.&lt;br /&gt;When I woke up, my lips felt soft and there was no need for reapplication.  This is great as usually I have to reapply over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;My mom came to me that morning and told me that he bottom lip had healed.  She commented on how soft her lips were as well.&lt;br /&gt;My husband said he just liked it.  (That&#x27;s a man&#x27;s comment there. LOL)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for this great product.</li>
    <li> I wish they were larger . Excellent and Cooling product. Very Moisturizing. I&#x27;m pleased and will be reordering more.😄😉👏👏👏👏👏</li>
    <li> These lip balms are great.  I love peppermint and it is hard to find.  This lip balm really hydrates my lips and are very smooth, not waxy.  I recommend them.</li>
    <li> I loved these balms so much, I immediately bought another set of 4 to hand out to friends and family. The balm leaves a nice soft gloss on your lips which I prefer. It doesn&#x27;t clump or get that odd crud that you often get after an hour or so. Lightly tingling, it brightens my lip color naturally as well.  It smells and tastes good, not chemically or waxy, like minty honey. The shipper is quick and very kind. They have taught me a few things I didn&#x27;t know about Amazon and how it works for companies, along the way. Defiantly a 5 star experience. I&#x27;ve already added them to my wish list so I can easily reorder or receive  more as a gift, which I would enjoy.</li>
    <li> Sadly this product does not work as well for me. The spearmint smell/tingle seems to be lacking and it feels very waxy compared to other chapsticks I&#x27;ve used. Blistex is a fraction of the price for 3, so I am going to stick with that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a freak for natural products with no hidden crap. There always seems to be something buried in the ingredients list that really isn&#x27;t good for you. Especially when it&#x27;s on my face. Not on this lip balm. I was a little worried it was too good to be true and wouldn&#x27;t moisturize really well. Well I can tell you they have a winning formula that feels really nice and last a long time. There&#x27;s a slight tingle from the peppermint that I just love. I rarely write reviews, but I had to come and say how great this company is - I purchased this off their website - their customer service and response time is bonkers... and it&#x27;s a real person, in the US. I am genuinely impressed with their level of care. Thanks for a wonderful product and great buying experience!</li>
    <li> This lip balm is perfect for me!  For years I have struggled with lip balms because the commercial sticks dry and crack my lips.  I must be sensitive to the chemicals they use, because I can&#x27;t wear lipstick either.  I decided to take a chance on this product and have not been disappointed.  I waited to write this review until I had used the product for several days to be sure I didn&#x27;t have a bad reaction to it.  I must say,my lips are soft and less dry than I can ever remember.  I liked the peppermint taste, but just ordered some other flavors to see if I have the same wonderful result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I think you will be pleasantly surprised if you try this lip balm.</li>
    <li> Nice product - very subtle peppermint smell and doesn&#x27;t feel too waxy like some other organic lip balm.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Wish the reviews or description had mentioned that this lip balm has a slightly sweet taste. Wouldn&#x27;t have bought it if i knew... now warning others who may not want to taste their lip balm.</li>
