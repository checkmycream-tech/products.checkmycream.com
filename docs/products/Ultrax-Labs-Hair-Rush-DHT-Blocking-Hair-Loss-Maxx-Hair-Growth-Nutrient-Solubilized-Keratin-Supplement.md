<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this for a little over 3 months now and can definately tell the difference that it has made on my thinning hair! There has been no more clumps of hair in my brush or the bathtub drain. If you have thinning hair or hairloss, this is the product for you!!</li>
    <li> Noticed that all the 1 star reviews are verified buyers.. Didn&#x27;t do anything for me and I don&#x27;t have that much money to experiment with and keep buying more.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing… It is easy to take, it has tons of good vitamins and best of all IT WORKS….&lt;br /&gt;I will order again.</li>
    <li> Ok, so let me start by stating this. I have always been a skeptic of any pills, supplements, etc. But I am so happy that I was able to put my previous bad experiences behind me, and give this awesome product a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew I had to do something about my hair, and after much deliberation I settled on Ultrax Labs, because it was already a brand I knew and trusted. I went with their Hair Maxx DHT Vitamin Supplement, and sometimes I still kick myself for not having done it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I have to urge you to try it, just do! If you are feeling helpless, unattractive, and hate to take pictures without a hat on, because you feel like you are becoming bald, I know how you feel. Give Hair Maxx  a try, be patient and let it do it&#x27;s work. It was a great experience for me! I still use the product today... Now my hair is healthier, stronger, longer! I can go and on, but a great added bonus (and completely unexpected) were my nails. Just know that you will as happy with this product, as I am...</li>
    <li> This is a fast working and effective  product, i seen results  2 weeks after taking it.</li>
    <li> This works better than everything I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
    <li> After using my Ultrax Labs Hair vitamins for a couple weeks, I can already see a difference. My hair is stronger and doesn&#x27;t break off like it use to. I use to lose a lot of hair, especially in the shower, but now I hardly notice any shedding! My hair feels thicker and healthier!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this.  Weill be ordering more.  Defiantly a good buy.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Have been using this supplement in conjunction with Ultrax Labs Hair Surge shampoo and Ultrax Labs Hair Lush serum and have noticed my hair has stopped falling out during showering; hair feels thick, and voluminous. The supplement have a good amount of vital vitamins and is convenient to take; i take it in morning right before breakfast.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I am completely obsessed with almost the entire line of these products!...haven&#x27;t tried em all yet ;) For years I have been torchering my hair with heat and color...and I always wondered..why wont my hair grow past my shoulders? Nothing was working for me...I decided to try this product because it seemed like a more &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; choice. People: cheap normally isn&#x27;t good. Im glad I decided to invest a little bit of money in these because in the end I was throwing my money away with the stuff that didn&#x27;t work!!</li>
    <li> Fast Results. Works much better than Biotin. Packed with other vitamins too! Great formula &amp; amazing product. Contains Nettle Leaf and Pumpkin Seed Extract--amazing combination for Natural Hair growth. No Side effects! I would recommend this product to anyone who suffers from hair loss.</li>
    <li> I am 24 and the man in my family has always suffered from early hair loss, Hands down this is best hair loss product on the market. One of the best things about this product is that it’s made from natural ingredients. I ordered it from the beauty superstore plus they are amazing delivery was on time and product was intact 5 stars all they way.</li>
    <li> My hair started growning in the front of my forahead where it was thining. When I went back to the barber he said my hair looked great. My nails started growing too and are stronger. I would recommed this. I used it a month before I could see a real difference. I hope it works for you too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these bc of the keratin in here as that was recommended by my stylist to aid in hair growth.</li>
    <li> I have used this and it works very well in stopping my hair loss.  I definitely recommend it to anyone facing this issue.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, have been using it for a few weeks and it definitely works! My hair is stronger and fuller than it was when I was in my twenties. Its hard to go wrong with all of the vitamins and keratin that Hair Maxx has in it!  I definitely reccomend to anyone looking for thicker, fuller and longer hair!</li>
    <li> Rather than spending thousands of dollars for hair implant, this is a safe vitamin pills that fuel the regrowth and thickens thinning hair.  I have a bald spot and thinning hair on my scalp and I&#x27;ve started taking this along with the caffeinated shampoo and serum applications.  It is amazing how soon my hair is growing back and thickening!!  It&#x27;s only been 2 weeks and I&#x27;m seeing drastic results.  Wow.  Pretty impressive.  Must try.    Use in conjunction with the shampoo and hair serum from Ultrax Labs, you will see fast results immediately.  Great products!  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair loss product out there in my opinion. I bought this for my dad and he absolutely loves it! His hair loss has stopped and he can&#x27;t be any happier. The product is safe and doesn&#x27;t have any side effects. I will keep buying this product for my dad until he says otherwise!</li>
    <li> Using this product has made my hair grow tremedously in the past 3 months.my hair has never been so full, thick, and long.along with my regualr routine of washing and conditioning i add this to my hair regiment and like magic my hair is alnost growing down my back.im in love!</li>
    <li> My hair shedding has almost stopped and my hair is so much more fuller and healthier, it is crazy how much this product has helped! I would recommend this product to anyone....</li>
    <li> This is one great product! It did wonders for my hair! I thought I would never have thick bouncy hair again! I love it and am so grateful!!</li>
    <li> I had heard good things about this particular supplement. I found it very easy to take. I also noticed a overall general health improvement. I would reccomend this product. It is well worth the price. You pay for what you get with this supplement.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of this product.  I have been taking it for a little more than a month and in that time I have noticed my hair getting stronger, healthier and growing faster.  I had noticed my hair falling out in the shower a lot but since iv started taking ultras labs hair maxi i have not been having that issue</li>
    <li> This product has made a huge difference in the amount of hair that I was finding on my pillow, in the shower and in my hairbrush in the morning.  I would literally have several hairs coming out every time I ran my hands through my hair; I was finding hairs all over my clothes during the day and since I started using this product, the amount of hair has been reduced dramatically.  I was shocked; not sure if this would work but figured I had to try something.  There are so many different products out there for hair re-growth but I just wanted to keep the hair I have.  I&#x27;m convinced this is making a difference.</li>
    <li> Works fantastic! A great amount of Nutrients, great if you are experiencing hair loss, all around great product! I would recommend to anybody in need of a hair loss cure!</li>
    <li> A friend uses this and says it works great.  Felt her hair stronger then when using prenatal vitamins. She suffered from hair breakage and after using this she had less breakage and shedding.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in hopes of stimulating my hair growth naturally, as it contains natural herbal ingredients. I have just began consuming the recommended dosage of 2 capsules daily this week, and to my surprise I have not experienced any unpleasant side effects (thus far). Although, I am often sensitive to certain herbs and vitamins, this one seems to be gentle on my stomach, and the capsules are easy to swallow. I am anticipating on seeing more visible results within the next few weeks, and will continue making this supplement a part of my daily regimen.</li>
    <li> Works.&lt;br /&gt;This will also improve the condition of your existing hair and nails. Make sure you take it daily. The change is subtle and it takes a few weeks for the active vitamins/minerals to build up to active levels in your system.</li>
    <li> Do not be fooled by all the fake-positive reviews. This product is a scam. Does not work, save your $$.</li>
    <li> This is a must have if your having any trouble in the hair area.</li>
    <li> This product really helps with reducing hair loss and helping keep hair full. It makes hair seem healthier and thicker and you can really see a different after taking these. Definitely recommended to help hair growth and prevent hair loss.</li>
    <li> I was really surprised at how well Hair Maxx has worked! I am a longtime believer in supplements, but have always been skeptical about their effectiveness on hair loss. Well, I have been proved wrong! I have found this product more helpful than Rogaine. There are so many essential vitamins contained in these tablets that promote hair growth and overall hair health that anyone who is struggling with weak, thinning strands they call hair or wants to take preventative measures should give this a try. I&#x27;ve seen noticeable improvement after less than a month. I do think it&#x27;s important to note that I take the supplements religiously - morning and night, every day. My hair is actually growing and is showing signs of improved health and texture. I&#x27;ve also noticed a decrease in the amount of hair I&#x27;m losing as well. Overall a great addition to my current hair loss regimen.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6 weeks now. As most I expected to see results right away, it took about a month, but after that the progress in new hair growth was amazing! I also see fewer hairs all out when showering or brushing my hair. i would recommend this product to anyone who has go through hair loss or even for people who just want thinker or stronger hair. It&#x27;s definitely worth the wait!</li>
    <li> Great product! Hair Maxx has been very helpful in my combat against hair loss. I definitely recommend this product if you suffer from hair loss like myself.</li>
    <li> I have a minor receding hairline on the left and right sides of my forehead. Earlier this year it bugged me enough that I decided to do something about it. After checking out reviews on multiple products and doing some research, I settled with a bottle of this product and a bottle of Lipogaine topical treatment. I figured I would try attacking my hair problem from both the inside (Ultrax Labs supplement pills) and the outside (Lipogaine topical treatment). After just one month of taking the pills in the morning and putting the topical treatment on twice a day, I was already seeing my hairline regrowing back again. They were little hairs, but it was so nice to see some improvement rather quickly. Now I&#x27;m three months into it and my hairline is looking a lot better and I&#x27;m no longer bothered by it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did experience some side-effects, mainly dry skin on my face and ears as well as some itchiness on the spots where the topical treatment was applied, but I believe the Ultrax Labs pills were not to blame. The dry skin was only temporary and I just took a two day break from the Lipogaine and applied moisturizer to alleviate the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I cannot say if just taking this product alone would have made a difference. Personally, I feel the Lipogaine is directly impacting my hairline growth while Ultrax is boosting the Lipogaine&#x27;s effects for faster results and helping my hair in general feel healthier.</li>
    <li> Hey guys look at how the 5 star comments are written they are all fake. You would think it&#x27;s the  scientist who created this placebo who wrote them. I didnt see any change after three months...This was terrible purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this supplement a few months ago due to Ultrax Labs&#x27; amazing track record, and I was not surprised to see this product once again live up to their standards. It&#x27;s definitely stopped my hair loss, and is actually making healthy new hair grow in! The capsules are easy to swallow, not too big or anything. I&#x27;m excited to see progress and if nothing else could seal in my trust for Ultrax, this product sure did.</li>
    <li> I was a little apprehensive about this product when my mother-in-law purchased this for me. I did not see any results for the first week or two. I really did not believe my wife when she said that she saw a few new hairs beginning to show in the thinning area on top of my head, I use this supplement with the Ultrax Lab Surge Caffeine Hair Treatment Shampoo. I must say that I will recommend this product to my brother and uncle who are much worse than I am in the thinning/balding hair dept.&lt;br /&gt;  Thanks Ultrax Labs for giving me hope.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. My nails did grow fast n reason I&#x27;ve noticed that because I&#x27;m a guitar player n I would cut my nails once a week. With this I have to cut my nails twice a week</li>
    <li> Using Ultrax Labs Hair Rush DHT really promotes thicker hair with prevention of hair loss! These little shed stopping thickening pills help to bring a whole new head of hair back into your life! With thin hair and the feeling like I shed more than my dog, giving these pills a trial run has turned into a repeat purchase. After looking for products to help me feel like the old me again, I have found the solution. It feels great being able to run my hands through a thick head of hair again! This product stops the thinning, shedding and brings regrowth and revitalization to your hair! I would recommend this product to people having similar issues, both men and women. With a mix between using these Ultrax Labs Hair Rush pills and the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Shampoo just proves that your hair can feel young again! As these are not an instant result product, give it a couple months with the recommended doses and you see proven results!</li>
    <li> Guys all the 5 star reviews are scams! Click on the names of everyone that gave them 5 stars, most are not verified buyers and if you click on their names you can see that every single one of them also gave this product [...] review a 5 star review. Sort of strange that all of them also happened to buy that product? No its just a scam! Also the wording is so fake. I didn&#x27;t buy it, but I almost did. +1 this review, or [...] so that others wont get sucked into this trap!</li>
    <li> My hair is so much healthier thanks to ultra labs. I love the way my hair feel is so much vibrant. My hair was thinning but its not anymore ultra labs hair rush has restored my hair back to life. I would definitely use the ultra labs hair rush again and recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> This product lives up to what it claims!!! Great results!</li>
    <li> This product has done wonders for my hair!  I never thought I would have thick, healthy, strong hair again after color treating so many times.  But with Hair Maxx it&#x27;s all possible.  You have to give this a try!!</li>
    <li> The Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx DHT Blocking Hair Loss Hair Growth Nutrient Solubilized Keratin Vitamin Supplement is an excellent product. It contains more than 23 essential vitamins that stimulate hair growth. I started taking it a week ago and already can see that it has decreased my hair loss. It nourishes my tresses and leaves them looking lustrous. I am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful, for anyone that is losing their hair and want to get it back.  I use it and it was actually referred by a good friend of mine who was having major problems with hair loss.  There are many products that make claims that their products work, and I have tried a few with no results to be seen.  This product I can attest myself of it&#x27;s validity.  You will be wondrously amazed at how your hair will look.</li>
    <li> Noticed nothing after continued use of one bottle. Did not reorder.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx DHT Blocking Hair Growth Nutrient Solubilized Keratin Vitamin Supplement for a few month now, and honestly it&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;m only 27 years old, but I started losing my hair early on. I&#x27;ve noticed since using this product and using Ultrax Labs products in general my hair has been growing back. One month into using this product alone I started noticing very little hair fall out and my hair growing back. My hair is actually thicker than when I was 18! I couldn&#x27;t have ask for a better product or one that works better. This product is way more than anything I&#x27;ve seen on the market, it is not only just one ingredient but 23 essential vitamins that stimulate hair growth in one that all come together to help the product! I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone that has a hair thinning problem!</li>
    <li> Where I used to have thinning patches is new growth!&lt;br /&gt;Less breakage and I lose much less hair then I was.&lt;br /&gt;Totally thrilled with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Am very happy and sure to be ordering again before my bottle runs out!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Ultrax LabsHair Maxx!</li>
    <li> Came quickly. easy to swallow pill size. However, it is just too pricey (by $15 competitive wise) for the mimimal results.</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I found this product!  I have very coarse, brittle hair that breaks easily and have been suffering from shedding for some months.  I have been taking two tablets a day for the past month and I am amazed at the difference - my hair is much thicker and stronger and looks much healthier.  The best thing, though, is that I haven&#x27;t had any more shedding!  I will be excited to see how much my hair has grown in another month.  I can&#x27;t recommend this product highly enough!</li>
    <li> What a difference. I began noticing results within a week or less. More volume, less loss, and does exactly what it says it will do. Wonderful to know that something finally works. I love this stuff and am hooked!</li>
    <li> Hair Maxx really does help with hair loss. I have seen a remarkable difference in my growth pattern. I usually relax my hair at a certain number of weeks like clockwork but since starting this Hair Maxx I have needed to relax my hair sooner than normal which means that it is growing at a faster rate than before.</li>
    <li> Thank you ULTRA Labs for restoring my youth.  These vitamins are a part of my diet now.</li>
    <li> Real results don&#x27;t happen overnight. I gave it 2 months before I noticed less shedding and new growth around my temples. I would recommend this supplement to anyone experiencing hair loss for any reason. Bonus, all natural ingredients :)</li>
    <li> False advertisement, fake reviews--this is nothing more than a placebo pill. Look at the ingredients and then the price, something doesn&#x27;t add up! these pills do not work, and they taste awful. For 60$ you may as well go get a prescription for REAL hair loss pills from your doctor because this certainly isn&#x27;t worth it. Even more infuriating is the picture that says &amp;#34;100% money back guarantee&amp;#34;--total bull, good luck trying to get your money back. Ultrax is a very shady company and they&#x27;re particularly difficult to get into contact with. After calling Amazon, I managed to get a refund, but only after the saleswoman tried giving me 10% of my money back-- HOW CAN A PRODUCT OFFER A 100% MONEY BACK GUARANTEE IF YOU ACTUALLY CAN&#x27;T GET THE MONEY BACK?? my advice to Ultrax, TAKE THIS PHOTO DOWN, YOU DO NOT OFFER A REAL MONEY BACK GUARANTEE! luckily amazon was there to save the day. Bad product, just take biotin, its much cheaper and more effective, i&#x27;m sure.</li>
    <li> It arrived promptly in an envelope-bag. The bottle is pretty much exactly what you would expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tablets are a sort of oblong oval and not much larger than a typical NSAID or aspirin. Sixty tablets at two a day (I took them with breakfast and dinner) yields a months supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preventing hair loss can be a fairly desperate thing so, naturally, I am trying multiple products. In my best opinion I would say that this really is making a positive difference for me. I&#x27;d repeat my order without hesitation. It&#x27;s not a miracle cure, but it&#x27;s not doing nothing; and, after all, it is a supplement - not a replacement. I&#x27;ve tried other Ultrax products and found that to be a positive experience as well.</li>
    <li> Fuller Bangs and Less Hair in the Drain-Five Stars    I have been taking the Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx DHT Blocking Hair Loss Hair Growth Nutrient Solubilized Keratin Vitamin Supplement twice daily now for a few weeks.  I have very coarse hair and I&#x27;ve had a lot of breakage issues because of coloring it for years.  This week I had my roots colored by my regular hairdresser, and he noticed a significantly less amount of hair loss in the drain when he washed my hair.  He has commented on it often which has really stressed me out.  My hair seems overall a bit shinier, and the really awesome thing, which I hope will only get better as I continue taking this supplement, is that the hair growth of my bangs, on my temple where I part my hair, is already noticeably fuller.  I&#x27;ve had these whispy little baby hairs for a long time that don&#x27;t grow, and now it looks like some real hair is growing in.  You can&#x27;t go wrong using this product.  There is absolutely no con in my opinion, as the vitamins are primarily B vitamins which are good for your heath on all counts.</li>
    <li> When you look at the ingredients listing for Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx DHT Blocking Vitamin Supplement you can&#x27;t help but be intrigued by its unique formulation of herbs and minerals. Who knew pumpkin seed powder, nettle leaf powder, and the saw palmetto plant had anything to do with accelerating hair growth. I used to think I would try almost anything to stop the thinning hair on my scalp and to make my hair grow faster, even surgical procedures, and products with risky side effects, until I did some research and learned there are safe over-the-counter products like this that are as effective as physician prescribed medications and surgical procedures. Having had success with Ultrax Labs products in the past, it wasn&#x27;t surprising that Hair Maxx DHT Blocking Vitamin Supplement made my hair grow faster. I noticed results sooner than the suggested 90 day period. It also seemed to improve the porosity (smoothness), and the tensile strength of my hair, which makes sense, because hair that is smooth, well moisturized, and strong, will lead to less loss of existing hair. So it&#x27;s great the Ultrax Labs supplement addresses both hair growth, and hair health. I will continue the use of this product for an extended time frame in an effort to realize it&#x27;s full benefit in restoring my hair to it&#x27;s original glory.</li>
    <li> I had a bad hair accident a year ago as of November 2014.  My hair was down to the middle of my back. I went to my hairdresser for a simple body wave which resulted in a kinky spiral perm that I tried to straighten myself the next day and my hair began to melt off and fall out. I had to cut all my hair off because it was severely breaking off in chunks and felt literally like pine straw.  I have spent nearly $1000 in hair products and treatments to get my hair to grow back healthy.  I have tried almost nearly every reconstructive product on the market, amongst other things.  It wasn&#x27;t until recently when I started heavily dosing my hair vitamins that I have seen results.  I am taking 3 different hair vitamins (this included) and massaging my scalp with Jamaican black castor oil once a week at night.  I was skeptical after I received this because of the price and the ingredients.  These ingredients are the same as a walmart brand I take that&#x27;s a third of the price. I was going to send these back but decided not to out of simple frustration of getting my money back.  So I decided to keep them and see if I would notice any difference.  The only difference in ingredients is that there is keratin in ultra maxx, yet my walmart brand vitamins have somewhat higher percentages of vitamins.  Other than those observations the ingredients are the same.  It doesn&#x27;t list any special ingredients in ultra maxx for DHT blocking, only keratin.  I haven&#x27;t done significant in-depth research on keratin so I am not sure if it aids in DHT blocking or not.  I began taking my heavy dosage combo in early December.  I am taking a regular hair, skin, and nails vitamin, 10,000mg of Biotin, and I added one tablet of the ultra maxx to the combination.  I was a little scared to take two ultra maxx like it suggested because of the combo I was already taking.  I took a profile picture of my hair on December 4, 2014 and the same profile picture January 1, 2015.  There is a significant difference of about an inch and a half growth.  I have also noticed that I have less hair fall.  After I wash my hair in the mornings I notice I have less coming out in the shower than I had before starting the ultra maxx.  I only gave it three stars because I was skeptical of the ingredient list as it is the same as my other vitamins and with the price being so expensive.  The price has even increased since I last ordered.  So far I am impressed with the fact I have less hair fall and if this continues I may purchase them again.bout an inch and a half growth.  I have also noticed that I have less hair fall.  After I wash my hair in the mornings I notice I have less coming out in the shower than I had before starting the ultra maxx.  I only gave it three stars because I was skeptical of the ingredient list as it is the same as my other vitamins and with the price being so expensive.

    <li> This hair supplement seems to be helping my hair look better already. I haven’t used it for the full 90 days yet, as suggested, but I am already noticing a difference.  It’s got a blend of vitamins that really does the trick. The Keratin is supposed to increase growth and slow down hair loss.  I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to improve the look of their hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now. At first I didn&#x27;t see much difference, but within the first couple weeks or so I noticed there was less and less hair falling into the shower drain. Eventually, I began to feel and see more volume and body to my hair. I plan on continually repurchasing bottles in the future so as to not interrupt the progress I have seen thus far. I highly recommend this product for anyone who has a problem with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> As a woman, I am very vain about my hair. I noticed a few months ago that I was starting to show signs of thinning around my part, and knew I had to do something. I started by asking my stylist her recommendations, and was absolutely floored by the costs. So, I decided to start shopping around. After reading some articles and reviews about different products, I originally decided to purchase a different brand of oral supplement, along with coordinating shampoo and conditioner. I was not impressed with the results. So I then decided to try my second choice, which was Ultrax labs.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about this product is that the pills are much smaller and don’t have the odor I noticed with my first choice. I tend to have issues swallowing large pills, these are a nice, reasonable size. The second thing that struck me, was the cost. The first set of products cost me nearly $250 for a one month supply of 3 products. All told, I have spent closer to $150 for these.&lt;br /&gt;I am one month in one this product, and I have noticed so much growth! Even my stylist commented on it, as I had to book my appointment to recolor my hair much sooner than normal. I have also noticed that my nails are growing faster, and are much stronger than previously. Definitely a win in my book!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product, easy to take, reasonably priced. What more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> Made me nauseous every time I took it ..on top of that it didn&#x27;t even work. Don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> The product is just the opposite of what it claims to be effective</li>
    <li> Great for hair growth. These pill have the nutrient the body needs to regrow hair and also great for the skin. Thanks</li>
    <li> I started using this product about three months ago, and it has made a noticeable difference in the quality of my hair - it is a lot fuller now and generally more vibrant.  I have noticed that I have lost less hair after using this product.  I would highly recommend this, in conjunction with this brand&#x27;s shampoo and other products.</li>
    <li> I used this product for at least 6 months but didn&#x27;t see any results. I&#x27;d like to request a refund.</li>
    <li> Great Product. Definitely does help with hair loss...</li>
    <li> I started losing my hair in patches and this medication turned it right around. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now and I can already see the difference. I feel so much more confident now that I know my hair is coming back.</li>
    <li> I cannot testify for everyone as to how good this product will work for them, but in my case, it works great! My hair was thinning and breaking before I started using Ultrax Labs hair products and I have found results since using their products. I don&#x27;t know if it is a side effect or what, but my hair is not graying either. I had gotten a tip from a cousin who was using their products and when I saw it working for him, I gave it a try and have been a loyal customer since due to the results I get.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied and impressed by this solution. For those looking for quick effects, check the shower to see how much hair is lost before and after. I can speak from my experience that the product has improved the quality of my hair and the significantly minimizes the amount lost even after a month!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great that it is supplements with elements that don&#x27;t have any negative side effects based on my own searching and other helpful reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this solution to a number of folks who I know have similar hair loss concerns.  For those who are starting to go through thinning or balding, don&#x27;t delay! Never too early to start getting your confidence back.</li>
    <li> I decided to give this product a chance based on all the wonderful reviews,so I&#x27;m glad i gave it a chance.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t take time to write any product review, but I’ve been pretty happy after using this product. I have so much breakage and my hair is thin. I also use a particular hair thickening lotion for a long time that relatively work, but as getting older, I’ve been experiencing the limit of effectiveness. So I thought of taking a supplement because I thought I should change it from inside my body just like taking a vitamin every day. I can see the difference. I don’t see much breakage like before, and I can feel my hair is thickening little by little. I’ll try another bottle.</li>
    <li> In the short time that I&#x27;ve been using this product, I have noticed a great improvement in my hair health. My hair loss has slowed, and existing hair seems to be fuller and stronger. The ingredients of the tablets are easily recognizable, and as an added bonus contains many nutrients found in my daily multivitamin. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone searching for an easy to maintain hair re-growth program.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs hair Maxx products have worked great for me. The time it takes for results to start showing is a bit long, but these vitamins have done their job. The vitamins included, for example vitamin E, all aide in helping your scalp which helps your hair in the end. healthy scalp, healthy hair. I defiantly advise  everyone I know to take buy this product even if your NOT balding.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product several weeks ago to help fix my damaged hair. I’ve been taking one tablet in the morning, and one in the evening for the recommended two per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already seen some improvement in my hair quality. My hair feels thicker, and I do not lose as much when i comb my hair every morning. This is a relief! I’ve read some things online about Keratin and how it helps with hair growth and all that, but I was skeptical until I tried it out myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with this product and I will continue using it in the future.</li>
    <li> Good product. Does the job!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this supplement for 3months now, and the results are great! I&#x27;m not losing much hair in the shower like I used to, no more hairs all over the place! My hair feels much stronger, fuller, &amp; overall healthier since I began using this supplement.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling for a while losing my hair. Friend of mine has recommended me this great product. Shortly i started to notice that my hair began to feel thicker. Its such an easy to use and results are amazing.</li>
    <li> I have been taking Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx Supplement for four months now and I am really happy that I decided to invest in a hair-supplement. My hair has been thinning for the past few years, but now after taking the supplement I have noticed a significant reduction in hair-loss and my hair appears much thicker. I cannot go without this supplement now!!</li>
    <li> First off I&#x27;d like to start off saying this product does exactly what it says, Upon taking the pills I was skeptical at first until approx 2 weeks into taking the pills twixe a day I notice in my morning routine in the  shower my hair was not all in my  brush due to my hair shedding for the last couple of months.when I saw not coming out as I brushed it I was excited very happy because this product works internally and are made of natural products which is always a good thing for me.My hair is definately stronger and not shedding and for that makes this worth every penny I would recommend this for anyone having hair issue and want stronger thick hair, it gave me my confidence back and brushing my hair is no longer a drag I love this product because it really works  I am more than satisfied I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I used to lose a lot of hair every time I washed my hair. Now there is 90% less hair loss every time I wash my hair. It took less than a month for this to work and see new hair growth!</li>
    <li> Just started to use the product, and it seems to be working great! After just one day, I can my hair is already starting to feel healthier. There is less hair that falls out in the shower and from brushing, which is just great! My family has a history of thinning hair, so although this wasn&#x27;t an emergency hair situation I am so glad I started now! Can&#x27;t wait to see the continued results.</li>
    <li> After taking this product for just a few months I can definitely see a huge difference in the appearance of my hair.It is thicker and healthier than it has been in years and I am no longer experiencing hair loss.I am so happy to have found this product and the best part is that it is natural and provides many essential vitamins.I have also noticed my nails growing which is an added plus.I would recommend this product for anyone experiencing hair loss or simply anyone wanting to grown healthier fuller hair.</li>
    <li> I was having some issues with growing my hair, so I asked my cousin and she told me about how this product had worked tremendously well for her husband.  I figured I&#x27;d go ahead and take her advice.  Nothing else I tried was working any way.  It&#x27;s been 2 months now and I&#x27;ve seen a huge amount of growth around the edges of my hair.  My hair was growing so fast using this that I stopped using all my other hair growth products.  This definitely works.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how much more my hair grows in the next 4 months.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Hair doesn&#x27;t seem to be falling out as much as it did before. Will continue buying it.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all.  Total gimmick.</li>
    <li> Works very well! My hair is noticeably fuller since I started taking this. Definitely a must have for anyone with thinning hair</li>
    <li> I noticed a huge difference the first day but I wasn&#x27;t sure if I had imagine it so I waited a month.  Now i&#x27;m completely sure.  My hair noticeably stopped falling out the morning after my first pill (I&#x27;m only taking one pill as I am a 110 pd woman)  My hair had been falling out tons every time I washed it in the shower, now just a few hairs fall out.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any baby hairs or regrowth yet, but I&#x27;m thrilled to keep what I have for now.</li>
    <li> I lose a lot of hair - in the shower, when brushing, due to hormonal changes and probably stress. It&#x27;s worth it to try vitamins and supplements with other treatments I use for skin and general well-being. This has Keratin and Biotin in it so I thought I&#x27;d try these too. Lutein for eyes, Vitamin C for colds, use Keratin for hair loss. Maybe it&#x27;s the placebo effect, but it makes sense and I believe it&#x27;s doing some good.</li>
    <li> When I started losing my hair I tried all kinds of treatments with little success. I was happy to find Hair Rush DHT blocking supplement that contained natural ingredients and not a lot of chemicals I couldn&#x27;t pronounce. Since I started taking this supplement I have stopped losing hair and there is noticeable growth in places that were getting visibly thin. The added benefit is I feel clear headed and energized every time I take this supplement. I definitely will continue using Hair Rush supplements. It works!</li>
    <li> This Product is One That I Fine Very Useful , I love it hair loss is gone !  I used this product once before and loved the results. Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> This supplement is so much more than just biotin, it contains several other important nutrients to help your hair look its best.  The vitamin is easy to take, no noticeable after taste.  I make sure to drink plenty of water with it, so that the nutrients flow through my body quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been taking this for awhile now and am noticing good results.  My hair is thicker and stronger, it does not split as easily as it used to.  I really like the way it makes my hair look and am going to continue using this.  I have noticed that there are not as many stray hairs on my brush when I finish brushing my hair.</li>
    <li> After taking Maxx DHT, I saw great improvement. First, my hair started to not shed as much as before. Then I started noticing that it was growing fuller and thicker. Overall, I feel more confident and younger. So I&#x27;m very glad I bought this product!</li>
    <li> I have been noticing that I&#x27;ve been loosing more and more hair in the last few months with hairs falling out and breakage. It REALLY hit me when I tied up my hair and the thickness of my pony tail was MUCH thinner than it used to be. And trust me…it was a scary reality that I had to do something STAT.&lt;br /&gt;I did a ton of research and have tried a bunch of different products as well. I stumbled upon this product a few months back and read some positive reviews about it and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;It has been a little over 3 months since I&#x27;ve been using it…and it&#x27;s not like I have a whole new mane or anything crazy like that, but I definitely do notice that I have WAY more baby hairs growing out in the amount of time of trying it. The hair that I have on my head is looking and feeling healthier as well. I think that it&#x27;s probably due to the fact that the product is packed full of natural vitamins, nutrients as well as keratin which I know helps hair grow thicker and fuller. I&#x27;m very positive and happy at this point with my results. I&#x27;ll continue using this product and will see what comes out of it in the next few months!</li>
    <li> This is a great supplement to put in your regular regiment. Not only does in improve the health of your hair, it also improves skin quality and the thickness of your nails. You wont have to wait too long to see great results. I highly recommend Ultrax Labx Hair Rush.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t make any difference so far..but I did placed on order for 2nd bottle. I&#x27;m hoping it will start help my hair by the time I finish 2nd bottle.</li>
    <li> It is really nice to see that this product focuses on a more natural way to prevent hair loss. It implements more than 20 vitamins creating a powerful blend that literally revives your hair.&lt;br /&gt;The pills are easy to swallow, taking 2 a day the bottle will last for a month.&lt;br /&gt;Every hair responds in a different way,and even though it says to take it for 90 days &amp;#34;for best results&amp;#34; you can really see a difference within weeks.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with the results thus far. I have been using this product for just over 2 months and I can honestly say that my hair looks thicker and healthier than it has in a very long time. My barber even commented on it, asking me what product I was using because my hair was thicker than usual! I have not yet noticed the growth of new hairs that some users have reported but I truly believe that I will see these results as long as I continue to use this product. If you are suffering from hair loss and just want a solution that works, I highly recommend you give this a try.</li>

    <li> I have not had enough time to make a better observation as of yet. I need at least two more weeks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge health fanatic and I truly believe the vitamins in this product make all the difference. Like most women I have thinning hair as I age due to all I put it through. This product helps me undo my damage from the inside out.</li>
    <li> There are several products that I have tried over the past 2 years when my hair started to thin. So far i have tried Viviscal and Bosley hair supplements. I gave each of them a fair 3 months trial period. I did not see any noticable difference with these 2 supplements and after doing some Amazon research decided to give Hair Maxx a try. It has worked great for me in helping reduce hair loss. I have noticed less hair falling out when I shower and brush my hair. I have also switched to organic shampoo recently (I use Pura d&#x27;or currently that is great and pricey but have tried Mane n&#x27; Tail which is also good but cheaper). In addition to Hair Maxx I take extra strengh Biotin.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my results. I was skeptical at first but your patience will pay off. I am happy to see my old thick head of hair returning and I am going to continue using this product until my old think hair has fully returned (which I am confident will happen). I am very excited to see the results. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product was extremely helpful. I have always suffered from thinning (even loss of hair) hair and this product after only a few uses has helped my hair to grow back thicker and more natural looking. It is truly a blessing for anyone who is self conscious about their hair loss or thinning hair. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I just started using the pills and my hair has shown significant growth. And it&#x27;s only be 2 weeks. I&#x27;ll definitely continue using this product.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle, my first one was a gift from my uncle in FL, He bought a bogo of a two pack and gave me one only to taste it by myself.  After a month I wanted to continue with this treatment because I got good results with it.  This is a strength vitamin formula required by hair to grow and be strong.  I have seen good results with this supplement and I will continuing with this tablets.  The hair that is growing is strong and thick.</li>
    <li> I have been taking this product for a few months now and definitely feel there has been improvement and thickening of my hair.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what results I have over the NEXT few months.</li>
    <li> I have been having some major issues with my hair growing long and strong.  I have naturally curly hair that gets really dry easily especially when I am trying to grow it longer.  It has a hard time growing past my chest and when it does, it&#x27;s not full and thick.  To top it off, I lose so much hair throughout the day, I am surprised I still have any on my head! I lose hundreds of strands with just one shower or whenever I brush/comb it.  I really needed a product to boost my hair growth and a friend recommended I use this product.  Thus far I have seen a difference and I&#x27;ve only been using it about a month! I have seen less hair loss and my hair just feels thicker.  Excited to see the results the longer I use it!</li>
    <li> I am pleasantly surprised that I have had amazing results from Ultrax Labs Hair MaXx suplements. This is not medication rather its vitamins and minerals that WORK. My hair feels healthier and looks thicker. I am taking the Hair Maxx twice a day with no side effects and AMAZING RESULTS.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend these to anyone who is (like me) suffering from thinning hair/hair loss OR just want thicker fuller longer mermaid hair! Ive been taking them religiously for a few months and swear by them. I started noticing little to no shedding in the shower or on my clothes…Then came the baby hair…NOW my hair has totally filled-in and looks great. These really work &amp; I recommend them to all my friends (and strangers when they compliment me on my hair!). Highly recommend, A++++ product.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I have been taking this. We are on our 3rd month of taking Hair Maxx, and can not believe this our actual hair. My hair is fuller and longer then ever. The shine my hair has now is incredible. Definitely five stars from us.</li>
    <li> I finished taking one bottle of the hair recovery tablets and my hair looks really great. My hair doesn&#x27;t fall as much as before a decrease of 50% in hair loss.  I&#x27;m getting so many compliments so I feel great.  I highly recommend Hair Maxx.</li>
    <li> A coworker told me about Hair Maxx, and I&#x27;ll admit that at first I was a bit skeptical, but as she pointed out I had nothing to lose. I took one every day with my B12 vitamin, and after about three weeks I noticed I wasn&#x27;t losing as much hair in the shower. After two months I noticed that my hair, nails, and even my skin were healthier and nicer looking. 10/10 would (and did) recommend!</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Rush is an amazing product! I began taking when I noticed a lot more hair falling out than usual. Within a few weeks of taking it I started to notice the changes. My hair is feeling healthier and stronger. I notice much less hair falling out when I comb it or in the shower and it actually looks thicker already. I love Ultrax products so I was sure that Hair Rush would work, I just didn&#x27;t expect to see it working so quickly. A few people have asked me what I have done different to my hair and I tell them I am just taking great care of my hair with Hair Rush. I am sure a couple friends will be ordering also because they are very impressed with how fast it has worked for me. I can&#x27;t recommend Hair Rush enough, I will never use any other supplement for my hair. This is something I will continue to use for the rest of my life to keep my hair at it&#x27;s thickest and healthiest.</li>
    <li> I started using this product about a month and a half ago since I&#x27;ve noticed some thinning in my hair around the back and some receding in the front.  From what it seems, I&#x27;ve noticed less hair on my brush and in the shower.  From what I understand it&#x27;s high DHT levels that cause hair follicles to close up and stop growing hair. By blocking the DHT here and adding the Keratin supplement (good for hair, skin, nails, etc) it boosts hair growth.  Who knows, maybe it&#x27;s all psychological but it seems to help.  I use this in conjunction with other Ultrax products like the hair surge shampoo and a healthy diet to keep that hair loss down.</li>
    <li> Have been experiencing hair loss for a long time now &amp; tried different products that don&#x27;t really seem to work. A coworker recommended this to me so I tried it out and the results have been just amazing. I have been using this for a little less than a few weeks now. My hair is growing back a lot fuller and it is not as thin and patchy anymore. It starts working pretty quickly after you buy it. I have received many compliments from people I know that have noticed the difference. Excellent product, I highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> These vitamins have made such a difference! I started taking Ultrax Labs DHT Blocking Hair Loss Supplements a few months ago and I have noticed that my hair isn&#x27;t falling out as much in the shower or when I brush it.  I also notice a distinct change in the texture of my hair- going from dry and brittle to moisturized and thicker with much less breakage.  The Keratin in it has done wonders and is definitely blocking the DHT.  I would highly recommend these vitamins to anyone serious about reversing their hair loss.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical at first to try this product, but after seeing it work for a friend of mine I decided it was worth a shot. I gotta say after a month, I&#x27;m pretty impressed with the results. My receding hairline is making some sort of a come back and overall my hair looks fuller and feels thicker. I&#x27;ve tried all the shampoos and have had mixed results, but the vitamins in this product really seem to do something for my hair. Definitely recommend this product, and I will most definitely be using ordering again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m shocked at how well this product has worked for me. In the last few months my has hair stopped falling out and then started filling in nicely. Now you can&#x27;t even tell that I was ever suffering from premature baldness!</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Rush DHT Blocking Hair Loss Maxx Hair Growth Nutrient Solubilized Keratin Vitamin Supplement is amazing. I saw results in the first few weeks. I will be getting another bottle to keep the progress going. Thanks, Ultrax Labs.</li>
    <li> Great product to use to repair hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a hair loss supplement that actually works!  This is a great product that aids and stimulates hair growth. It contains vitamins, minerals and herbs that has helped stop my hair loss. I&#x27;ve been taking these supplements daily for 2 months and have seen wonderful results. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my results!! I am impressed and will continue to purchase this product. AMAZING!!!</li>
    <li> I lose a lot of hair when I diet. This seems to really counter-balance the hair loss. My hair has really come back.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to anyone who is experiencing hair loss. I started to see results after 30 days. I noticed small little baby hair growth and I noticed a lot less hair loss in the shower when I wash my hair. The vitamins and minerals in this supplement combined with the key ingredient Keratin is also making a noticeable difference in my fingernails. My nails were always very thin, brittle and would break easily but now they seem thicker and stronger. Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx supplement is well worth the money. When taken as directed you will be very happy with the results!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! We have a history of early hair loss on my mother&#x27;s side of the family. It has been my first full week of using this product and already I see results. My hair already appears stronger; less of it is coming out when I brush it. I have also had a small balding spot on the left side above my sideburns. Today I noticed tiny stubbles of hair starting emerge throughout my bald spot. I am so unbelievablely excited. I can&#x27;t wait to see what 3 weeks of progress brings.</li>
    <li> I had very high hopes for this, read all the reviews and took this for 6 months, which is more than enough to get results.  I kept my hair a little longer, maybe 4-5 inches.  I didn&#x27;t think my hairline was getting any better.  I cut my hair down to 1/2 an inch last night to see if my hairline improved.  NOTHING.  I&#x27;m sorry, I am seeing NO results.  And let me tell you about my lifestyle... I eat healthy, I don&#x27;t consume sugar, I take a biotin and saw palmetto morning and night and take these as directed midday.  I am on the Paleo Diet, I would imagine that would be a healthy enough diet to help these pills along.  I&#x27;m sorry but I have seen zero results.  My widow&#x27;s peak is still terrible.  My hair on top is still very thin.  And $60 is a LOT to waste on pills that do virtually nothing, if not absolutely nothing.  I seriously don&#x27;t know what else to do but I don&#x27;t think I want to risk $60 a month to hope for the best and hope these eventually work.  I don&#x27;t get the outrageous reviews stating miracles to happen, a full head of hair in a month or so.  That is bull.  You can see by my picture after taking these for 6 months nothing has happened and I highly doubt anything will.  I can&#x27;t possibly live or eat healthier than I do, with a strict diet of lean meats, nuts, seeds and plenty of fruits and veggies, along with my supplements.  These reviews must be scams written by paid advertisers or I am just one of the unlucky few that these supplements don&#x27;t work for.  The proof is in the picture, that&#x27;s 6 months of taking Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx.  Its not worth losing $60 to get no results.</li>
    <li> This product was something I didn&#x27;t think much of when a family member got me a bottle of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, in conjunction with the Ultrax Labs Stimulating Shampoo that I purchased, this stuff works wonderfully. After a few weeks, I noticed that my hair had completely stopped falling out in the shower. Between the shampoo and the nutrient that I&#x27;ve been taking, I&#x27;m starting to see a remarkable difference in my hair growth. My head is also warmer in the cold because I have more hair. It actually feels a bit thicker than it used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, friends want to know what I&#x27;ve been doing to have &amp;#34;healthier hair&amp;#34;, noticing it bounces and has more life to it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will reorder this product once my bottle runs out. Great product and well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Hair Maxx is amazing for your hair! I blow dry and flat iron my hair after every shampoo. Although I try to keep my hair in optimal health, daily wear and tear often leaves my hair dry, dull, and falling out. My solution is Hair Maxx. The supplement contains numerous vitamins which promote hair growth and strengthen your hair. In addition, it helps with circulation and lessens hair loss. As a bonus, the product also contains Keratin, a structural component of nails thus keeping them healthy. Highly recommended for both hair and nail health!</li>
    <li> I love, love the Ultrax Labs Hair MAxx. I am 45 years old and noticed my hair was thinning pretty fast too. I decided to buy Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx and after a few weeks I noticed the difference. You can definitely see the stubs growing I am so excited to see the end result. I am such a believer that I ordered a bottle for my sister. It also leaves your hair looking healthier and shinier. I would definitely say if you are curious you should try it, it works for me..</li>
    <li> Works great in conjunction with the hair surge shampoo!! great product for anyone who has weak/thinning hair!</li>
    <li> Ridiculous. Look to see if the reviewer really bought the product. It tells u right under &amp;#34;verified purchase&amp;#34; or something like that. No hair supplement works in one or two days GIVE ME A BREAK!!  &amp; Shame on the people writing them. Karma&#x27;s gonna come knock&#x27;n</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 3 months and saw hardly any benefit. For $60 a bottle (1 mo. supply), it&#x27;s a total rip-off. If you want Biotin, you can buy one on Amazon for $10-$15.</li>
    <li> Well, if i don&#x27;t have anything nice to say, I say nothing.. quite impressed with the results the discoloration of my nails is deteriorating. To find a natural method that always gets my attention. I took a break from Revivogen Scalp Therapy-Anti-DHT formula for hair loss , just was&#x27;nt seeing results .My target area! Front on my head which is coming together in batches yet working Its not falling out anymore.&lt;br /&gt;i cant say how fast it happened but, My friends have noticed I give 5 stars for working for me!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with hair loss for over the past few years. I&#x27;ve tried everything but nothing seems to work. But after a few uses with this product I could see a change in my hair growth. I was skeptical about this product but the product has really came through.  My hair has grown twice as fast my hair is thicker than it has ever been . However, if your hair is thin, or if you want to grow it faster and  thicker. This is the product you need to get TODAY !  overall the product did what it was supposed to do I am happy with the product I Highly Recommended !!</li>
    <li> Having used some of their external products for hair loss, I decided to try this supplement as well. It has been one of the better decisions I have made in my adult life. This products was able to immediately slow and then stop hair loss. I can now already see my existing hair looking healthier and have begun seeing signs of new growth in only a few weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;I have already recommended this product to some family members who have been suffering similar cases of hair loss. I have also recommended it to friends who want healthier and fuller bodied hair. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain by giving this product a try.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product, and instead of receiving this, I received TWO gardening books! Wtf? How does that even happen!?</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It is the first one that I have ever seen with vitamins and herbs specifically formulated for the hair.  I also like that it is in a tablet form since I try to avoid anything in capsule form unless it is a vegetable based capsule.  I am definitely going to order a bottle also for my husband.  My husband needs to give this a try since he is getting a thinning spot on the top of his head.  I definitely see that this product makes so much sense because you are replacing nutrients in the body that we tend to be low on as we age to help the hair grow.</li>
    <li> These pills are awesome! I&#x27;ve noticed an entire inch of growth within the first month (usually my hair grows ½ an inch per month). My hair is also thicker and doesn&#x27;t break off as much anymore. For faster results be sure to drink plenty of water, preferably take the pill with water too. I am very satisfied with this product and I will be ordering again in the future.</li>
    <li> I gave this 5 stars because it&#x27;s been 3 weeks now and I have already seen a difference in my hair condition. I&#x27;m a mother of 3 kids all 5yo and under, so I haven&#x27;t had good sleep for over five years now. I noticed that my hair are falling out a lot more then before. I would shower or comb my hair and there&#x27;s like double the amount of hair loss then a few years ago. I already have thick hair so I&#x27;m not concern amount the thickness, and of course my hair isn&#x27;t growing as fast as when I took prenatal during my pregnancy but it&#x27;s growing at a normal rate. I was getting worry about all the hair loss at my age ( early 30s).    I thought I&#x27;ll give this a try, the pills are a regular size, I&#x27;ve taken bigger pills then this so it was fine. If you think it&#x27;s too big then just cut it in half. It is like taking a multivitamin but concentrated for the health of your hair, I&#x27;m sure some of the vitamins are going somewhere else in my body that&#x27;s good for me too. It&#x27;s a 2 months supply and the info said that it will take 90 days to see best result. It&#x27;s been 3 weeks for me and I haven&#x27;t notice more thickness (since my hair is already thick),  BUT I have noticed that my hair is growing faster because I can tell from the length of my bangs going into my eyes sooner then my usual hair trimming schedule. Also, I&#x27;m not losing as much hair!!! I can see the difference on my pillow, in the shower, and in my comb. I&#x27;m definitely going to keep taking this. It&#x27;s already helping me at three weeks, I can&#x27;t wait to see what my hair will be like in 3 months!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my father and we have been pleasantly surprised by the effectiveness of this product. He has experienced the typically loss of hair due to aging and sought a product to help rectify it. After about a month, it was very obvious that he was growing new hairs where he was once balding. He also told me he found himself losing less hairs in the shower. Overall, we are quite satisfied.</li>
    <li> My sister in-law and I have always had brittle hair due to very tight weave installations on top of thinning edges. After using countless shampoo and leave in products with little to no results I came across Hair Rush capsules read a few reviews and decided to try it. We ordered 2 bottles each... Fast forward 6 weeks and not only did our hair get thicker but my edges are completely filling out. Breakage has subsided and I&#x27;m almost confident enough to wear my own hair for a change. Best part there isn&#x27;t any weird side effects. Will order again soon.</li>
    <li> It works great! My hair is much better looking and healthier. I&#x27;ve noticed that I shed less hair now too.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first and thought I was destined to have balding hair like my mother.  I have been using the Ultrax DHT Blocking Hair Loss Max Solubilized Keratin Supplement, the Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo and Conditioner for 3 months.  I have new hair growth that is visible around my hairline.  I noticed that there is a significant reduction in hair loss which I usually track by checking the shower trap in the drain.  My hairdresser even has noticed a difference and is going to recommend the product to her other clients who have this problem as well!!</li>
    <li> I love this product! Easy to take and work miracles. It does help reduce hair loss and improve hair growth. I totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> Just ordered second bottle of this hair loss prevention supplement. I&#x27;ve been using other products of Ultrax Labs and very happy with my results. My major problem was excessive shedding,  this became a real problem when I realized that temple areas on my head looked bald.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this problems are in the past. No more excessive shedding, new baby hair started to cover my head as a second coat hair. They shorter than my existing hair and look funny, but I see that I have more hair and I am so happy!</li>
    <li> I have had problems with shedding and thin easily broken hair.  I have been using this product along with the Utrax Hair Surge Shampoo and have noticed a improvement on the fullness of my hair.  There has also been less shedding in the shower and when I brush my hair.  I am very pleased with the results!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t beging to say how impressed I am with this product. My hair was thinning so I did some research and tried it out. None of the ingredients are harmful, and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad. I&#x27;m just so pleased that I have a thicker head of hair now because of this serum. I definitely recommend it for people who want to regrow some hair.</li>
    <li> This product is truly miraculous. I&#x27;ve been losing hair ever since I reached puberty and it&#x27;s embarrassing to have bald spots. What makes this product effective is that it contains keratin. For those of you who don&#x27;t know, keratin is a vital component in what makes up our outer skin - or epidermis, for my scientists - and affects hair and nail growth as well. I gear towards products which have keratin in them for that very reason but some products work better than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen amazing results with this product within the first two weeks. I bought it with the Ultrax Labs shampoo as well and using both of them together has really done wonders. I&#x27;m quite happy with my purchase and will be making one again when it&#x27;s finished.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve watched my father slowly bald over the past few years. What started as a receding hairline quickly spread down the back and sides. Thanks to Ultrax Labs, it&#x27;s finally coming back in the way I remember it as a kid! His hair is growing in full and thick, just like a man&#x27;s hair should be when he&#x27;s in his prime. He looks healthier and happier than he has in ages, making the price absolutely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He takes two pills a day and that seems to do the trick. It took a few weeks to kick in, but once it did, you couldn&#x27;t deny it. There are no side effects and he seems to love it! I&#x27;m very impressed with this product and would happily recommend it to any guy (or girl) dealing with thinning hair. I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I had always used biotin for my skin and hair, but never considered using a multi vitamin complex to help with my thin hair issue. I have used this product for about five months and have had fewer hairs fall out, and much less breakage when I comb. I tend not to blow dry, and occasionally use hot irons. I will continue to use these nutrients for the coming time.</li>
    <li> So much better than just a Biotin supplement! Not only is this product completely harmless and filled with vitamins and nutrients that are generally good for you but it actually works. I took the recommend dosage every day and by the end of the week I already noticed a difference. My hair felt thicker and healthier and the usual dullness was replaced by shine. When I brushed it there were almost no strays in the bristles when before they would be completely filled with fallen out strands. I have been worrying about thinning hair for many years but thanks to this product I know my troubles are over. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants real results.</li>
    <li> I find Ultra Labs Hair Rush DHT Blocking Hair Loss very helpful with my hair. My hair is thicker,&lt;br /&gt;shiner and feels stronger than it was before. There was less hair coming off at blowing dying after&lt;br /&gt;using this product. I usually need to use deep conditioner with my hair. After using this product I find I&lt;br /&gt;do not need to use the deep conditioner as much. I definitely approve.</li>
    <li> I had actually bought this for a good friend of mine whose in his mid fifties and was just starting to experience some hair loss. I had been using a hair growth shampoo to help thicken my hair and mentioned to him that it may be a good idea for him as well. But he absolutely hated the idea of switching to a shampoo that may not smell as great as his current stuff, and said he wished there was an oral supplement he could take that would help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially started poking around the internet for such a thing, thinking this would be a cute gag gift for him. But I started doing some research and it led me to this particular product. He&#x27;s only been using it for about 2 months but there is some new hair growth! Little bits of peach fuzz are coming in around his hair line and along the edges of the spots that had been fading and shedding. He does have a great metabolism for someone his age, so this could account for the rather quick results, but he&#x27;s certainly not complaining. This turned out to be one of the more useful things I&#x27;ve gifted him haha!</li>
    <li> I began using the Ultrax Caffiene Shampoo a while back and within the first week noticed results so i figured why not try the Ultrax Hair Maxx tablets. I&#x27;m so glad I did because with the two (and a b-vitamin supplement daily) I feel like a new person. I can tell you 100% that I am loosing less hair in the shower and in my brush and that my hair has started coming back to life where I want to wear it down again and not balled up in a boring bun. Worth the mini investment for sure.</li>
    <li> When my hair started shedding more than usual, I immediately began searching for a way to stop it. I tried the Ultrax Laboratories shampoo and conditioner for hair growth and it worked great at stopping the balding on the top of my head! However I was still worried that the problem would return, or hadn&#x27;t really gone away, so I looked into other Ultrax products since their shampoo had helped me. I usually don&#x27;t take pills or medicine for anything, but the amount of vitamins in this supplement changed my mind. I got them and followed the directions, two a day with food. After the month was over and my bottle was empty, I could definitely feel a difference in my hair! It wasn&#x27;t falling out all over my pillow as I slept anymore, and when I would brush I wasn&#x27;t afraid that I was losing half of my hairs! It was great. Even the tiny little hairs from the bald spot on the top of my head are growing longer and feel stronger than they were before! I am going to continue using this supplement along with my other Ultrax shampoos until my hair is completely back to normal! I would definitely recommend others to try out these for themselves!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve tried dozens of hair growth products and none seem to make a difference. I tried keranique and it really hurt my scalp and caused scabbing so I almost gave up trying anything else until a friend of mine suggested I try this once my scalp healed of course. Its been 6 months and I&#x27;m still ordering this product and wanted to share some of the reasons why... #1 Convenience in a small form it&#x27;s easy to be able to just take this and not have to apply something on your hair. #2 Price is pretty really fair for the quality #3 I does what to it&#x27;s supposed to do and you can see a huge difference within a few months of using this! I trust this company as well they always ship super fast and it&#x27;s so discreet!</li>
    <li> Hubby doesn&#x27;t think it did anything but cause sits on his scalp (probably due to the large amount of biotin in the capsules). You&#x27;re better of just buying a high-grade multi-vitamin and some extra silica, biotin (take extra zinc to prevent breaking out if need be), vitamin D (liquid high potency is the best), and keratin.</li>
    <li> When I first ordered this product I was more then a little skeptical of how it&#x27;d work out. After finishing the bottle though I can now tell you that another is on it&#x27;s way. This product is nothing short of amazing with how it helped the growth and overall thickness of my hair.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for a few weeks now and must say it does work. I had bariatric surgery and a side effect can be hair loss. Or at least thinning. I did lose some hair and felt self-conscious. After using this, I found new growth and it&#x27;s still growing! I also am noticing that the &amp;#34;old hair&amp;#34; is stronger and not as brittle. Have not noticed increased growth on other body areas. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This product is great! I noticed a change after a few weeks and my hair is stronger and grows much faster. I am having less noticeable hair loss and it appears thicker.</li>
    <li> I wish I&#x27;d found out about this product sooner!!!  I was skeptical, at first, because I&#x27;d tried other products to help with my shedding but I&#x27;m glad I gave this a try.  After about 2 months, I&#x27;d noticed a decrease in the amount of hairs I had to collect from my shower and after about 6 months, I hardly have any shedding at all. I&#x27;m here to tell you that if you have any doubts, don&#x27;t.  Try this product!!!</li>
    <li> This really works. I began using to stop my hair from shedding. I was amazed to find that after several weeks I noticed growth as well. I am pleased.</li>
    <li> The 23 essential vitamins required by hair to aid in circulation does work! I am very impressed by how these supplements take action. It made my hair A LOT thicker and fuller. Would highly recommend and would continue taking it on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> With the Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx DHT Blocking Hair Loss Hair Growth Nutrient Solubilized Keratin Vitamin Supplement my hair has shown a significant decrease in shedding. Along with less hair loss,  my hair looks extremely thick and is beginning to grow out.  With so many products on the market that make such claim...I can finally say that I have found the one that actually work. Anyone with hair loss or wants to increase hair growth must try the Ultrax Labs Supplement. Definitely no regrets...&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> My household, myself and husband. have been using this product for many months. I thought it was pricey, but it so proved me WRONG.&lt;br /&gt;I have seen a drastic difference to my hair, Lush and thicker; and my husband has stopped shedding and is now seeing some hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars, based on the product, and some great vitamins in it.&lt;br /&gt;Pumkin Seed Powder, Saw Palmetto, Zinc and B6, I know make a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Ultrax Labs for making great products. I am buying again.</li>
    <li> I am definitely a fan of Ultrax labs products and these supplements do not disappoint. I have been having problems with my hair thinning for years and just recently I&#x27;m beginning to see result using this Ultrax labs supplement.  These are 100% safe and have no side effects. The worst that can happen is that your hair won&#x27;t grow. I also find that this works better with Ultrax labs&#x27; other products such ass the caffeine hair growth shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love this!!! I decided to give this a try after reading amazing reviews. I have had an extremely persistent bald spot along my hairline, I can not remember the last time I wore my hair down due to how insecure I felt about the bald spot. I ordered my bottle...2 weeks in, I noticed I had new hairs growing in.. there was fuzz on my bald spot!!!!! A month and a half later I no longer had a bald spot, I had hair along my hair line! I could now wear my tied up. My shedding has stopped and I find my hair feels healthier and fuller! Ordering my second bottle now!</li>
    <li> So this is one of the products that I was not sure how it would work but had to try. So happy I did!! This product has been great, prior to using I was constantly loosing hair in the show but for the last two weeks I have noticed less hair loss and even see new hair coming in. I absolutely love this product!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not completely sure how, I&#x27;m no rocket scientist, but they finally made a product that works. I&#x27;ve barely been using this for two months and my wife is already noticing the difference. It was worth every penny, get yours quick and see th difference from other brands and this one.</li>
    <li> I had been dealing with hair loss for the past few years thanks to my family&#x27;s genetics. I wanted to fix it entirely, but knew that would be a longer process, so I decided I should look into delaying it as well. Ultra Labs delivers a product that blocks hair loss that actually works. After several weeks of use, I noticed my hair stopped thinning out and, though I didn&#x27;t expect it to happen in less than a few months, I did start to see a little bit of fullness coming back to my roots. I&#x27;ve always had dry hair, but Hair Maxx DHT&#x27;s 23 vitamins must have given my follicles some life, because my hair is starting to shine and feel less brittle.</li>
    <li> This is a great supplement to improve the quality and quantity of your hair.  It has about 20 different ingredients and each working together to make hair grow full and healthy.  And it helps anyone who&#x27;s going through hair loss.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Have taken tons of product and this is definitely in a competition of its own. Excited to see no more thinning. I recommend using this product with the ultrax shampoo for best results. These two products together make an awesome combo for getting thicker and stronger hair.</li>
    <li> I was extremely happy with the shampoo and conditioner, so I thought I&#x27;d enhance my new beautiful, silky hair more by adding the pills to my regimen. My hair is now thicker, longer and much more manageable with far less breakage. The Ultrax Labs products are fantastic!</li>
    <li> I started to include these supplements to my hair-growth regimen, and wanted to wait and see what results, if any, would be found.  To my surprise and amazement, within just a few days, I noticed something different about how my hair was looking and feeling, and contribute the result directly to the Ultra Labs Hair Maxx supplements.  I noticed that fewer hairs were found in my sink after combing and less of a loss in the show after shampooing.  My hair looks and feels stronger and fuller everyday, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t work for me,  but now that I see the results with my own eyes and know now that it does works, I know it&#x27;s worth the investment, and I plan on keeping these supplements in stock.  Another great product!</li>
    <li> This is a great product that does what it promises. There are no side effects, and you will quickly notice that you will have less hair loss very quickly. Next comes the new hair growth. This product is one I am already telling other friends and family to try!</li>
    <li> This product works. I have been using it for a couple of weeks and I noticed my full head growing thicker hair. It also stopped a lot of hair falling out. Apart from growing hair, this product made my hair look healthier and shinier.</li>
    <li> I bought Ultrax Labs&#x27; stimulating shampoo few months ago, and It worked amazingly since then I no longer have a thinning hair problem but my hair was not really smooth and shiny, it looked frizzy. My husband who is a biologist recommended me to heal my hair roots internally and I decided to try this product, it has been almost a month and my hair is much less frizzy and most importantly it looks much more healthier than ever ! I haven&#x27;t felt my hair as smooth and healthy as this in a long time. I feel very happy to finally found  a  product that actually works. I am really appreciate the developers of this product. I recommend you to take the pills with breakfast in the morning, not night time because all the vitamins and mineral pill contains seem to make me way too energetic.</li>
    <li> There is a reason why there is so many positive reviews, because it really works!! I have noticed such an improvement in my hair loss, people are starting to notice so it must work!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wonder upon this product while browsing Amazon looking for a hair growth pill. Then read all the positive comments and thought Hey let&#x27;s give it a shot! It&#x27;s work your money, personally I don&#x27;t know the science to it and I don&#x27;t really care All I know is that I see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve asked the doctor to see if it&#x27;s harmful to my body and he said its natural so your be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is that it works it took me 3 weeks to see results so be patience!</li>
    <li> When I started using this product, I mainly had two concerns - whether it would actually work as advertised, and if I was going to experience any side effects. LUCKILY, neither of these happened!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did accomplish what it was advertised to do.I am noticing less hair falling out while I&#x27;m taking a shower. When I look in the mirror, my hair appears more thicker, fuller, and healthier. It looks great!</li>
    <li> To be honest I was skeptical about this product, but the supplements seem to make my hair thicker. I&#x27;ve only been taking them for 3 weeks, and I wasn’t even expecting my hair to regrow from it.&lt;br /&gt;But the supplements combined with the shampoo didn’t disappoint me at all. Just have realistic expectations. If you want to improve the volume of your hair, I do think it works, but I wasn’t expecting a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx is a dietary supplement especially made for reducing hair fall and making them strong and healthy. They are known for their effectiveness in the global market. It contains clinically proven essential oils and vitamins which become the cause of dht blocker for your hair and help sustaining them.&lt;br /&gt;While helping your hair grow, the formula used in the making of the Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx prevents hair fall in the future.&lt;br /&gt;This product works more than my expectations, at a reasonable cost.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan, and I don&#x27;t say that about many supplements.  A friend of mine bought these for me a couple months back after she said they helped to thicken her hair and cause it to grow more quickly.  She tends to lose hair relatively quickly around the edges, but I noticed a difference, and she bought me some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d never recommend another supplement to anyone.  If your hair is a struggle-bus driving down a one-way street, then this is the product for you.  This, in combination with the shampoo I ordered from them, is everything!  I&#x27;m going to keep taking this stuff forever... or until my hair&#x27;s so long that I can&#x27;t take it anymore.</li>
    <li> Well made and carefully thought out product.The product came in well sealed.The directions are to take 2 capsules a day with a meal.The package size is 60 capsules,my suggestion is that once you start,keep on using the product until the product is empty to REALLY tell the effectiveness of the product.You will be amazed on the results.It has a blend of keratin and multivitamins with another more kind.</li>
    <li> Wow! After just 1 month of using this product, I have thicker eyebrows than I can ever remember.  Due to a thyroid issue, I&#x27;ve dealt with faint eyebrows for years.  This supplement has worked wonders on my hair, lashes, and eyebrows.  For $60, this was well worth the cost and patience.  I feel confident enough to go down to 1 pill daily and see if I keep getting great results.  Highly recommend to anyone suffering from hair loss.</li>
    <li> I can´t understand how people says it´s not working. In just a few months I feel a change in my hair. It feels stronger and looks better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was thinner every year and with this product and other Ultrax Labs products, my hair did not only grow thicker, but faster. I recommend to be patience with the product, because it takes a bit of time to fully work. I ran out of pills several times and bought them again. I am quite happy now! These vitamins work very well in my hair.</li>
    <li> Something greater than taking biotin, definitely recommend it for thinning of hair and hair loss. You don&#x27;t get the side effects as if you were taking the biotin. A must have!</li>
    <li> I have had a lot of problems with thinning hair recently. A friend of mine recommended Ultrax Labs products and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. My hair seems thicker and shinier already. I will definitely re order.</li>
    <li> For a while I had been struggling with my hair thinning and falling out, living in a day and age where looks count – this needed to be treated asap. That’s when I discovered Ultrax Labs Hair Max – the best product I have ever tried hands down! Within 90 days of using it I began to see the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maxx takes your hair loss and reverses the follicular function from the inside out. Maxx provides the proper nourishment with vitamins, minerals, herbs and keratin to rapidly increase hair growth – and for me that was extremely important, going bald is just not an option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say that Hair Maxx has been safe since I started using it and has helped me to regain myself confidence. A+++</li>
    <li> My hair was thinning and falling off faster suddenly. Then, I was recommended this supplement and it helped my hair to grow faster and longer. It has only been a couple of weeks and I can tell my hair has more thickness than usual. The strands of my hair are also stronger and have less split ends than usual. A plus is it adds shine and my hair has been more healthy than ever. Overall, it has been a nice experience with this supplement.</li>
    <li> At first I was worried about taking a leap to buy Ultrax Hair Maxx… but I gotta say im pleased with the outcome from this product, I am hoping that pairing this with my Ultrax hair surge caffeinated shampoo will bring my hair back to a much more full and thick head . I’ve only been about a month in and i must say.. my results have slowly been coming in! The product does take a minimum of 14 weeks for best results. I highly recommend Ultrax Hair Maxx to anyone looking to make a positive change in their life. The fear I had of not having a thick full head of hair is in the past! Thank you Ultrax!</li>
    <li> This product actually works! I started taking it and the hair I had lost began to grow back, and my hair overall felt stronger. My hair actually looks thicker! It took about three weeks to notice a difference, taking it everyday. It works better than any other product I have tried, and I can truly see the results. It has had an effect on my hair as well as my self esteem, and I feel more confident because my hair looks better! I would recommend this to anyone with thinning hair or noticeable hair loss.</li>
    <li> The 20 essential nutrients, vitamins and herbs must be doing the job as I am noticing a considerable difference in the thickness of my hair as well as re-growing in areas I thought were long gone permanently. This product works in conjunction with proper hair shampoo and conditioner as I am combining it with. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product at first.  But, I have discovered that this product helps prevent my hair from falling out and shedding so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The science behind this product I sound.  and the results are proven.  Definitely a five star product.</li>
    <li> These keratin supplements are great. If you want thicker hair with less hair loss, these are perfect for you! You will not regret the purchase!</li>
    <li> I have noticed a real difference in my hair loss since taking these pills.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if they would really work, but I do find that I am losing less hair.  I will definitely keep taking them because it has been really upsetting to be losing hair at 40 years old!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. After using for a few weeks you can notice significant hair growth throughout the scalp.  It also makes the rest of your hair appear more lustrous and healthy and shedding of hair diminishes.  Definitely a product to get if your hair is thinning and you notice loss and want to have a healthy head of hair.  It&#x27;s a great product to solve a sometime, embarrassing problem.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 bottles and unfortunately this product did not work for me. No results.</li>
    <li> love it, it actually made my hair thicken nd more healthier, I love it been using for couple months and im not planning to stop</li>
    <li> Awesome product. You can definitely see results.</li>
    <li> Did not grow even one strand of hair .... Pills are poo.</li>
    <li> I have found the holy grail of hair loss prevention, and life is good. I take the Hair Maxx DHT blocking supplements in conjunction with the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Shampoo and my hair has legitimately never looked or felt better. Seriously, I can hardly believe it myself, but this $*#@ is actually working! The thinning has been halted, thank goodness, and my hair is visibly thicker and more luscious everyday. I can&#x27;t speak for the science of it, I have no idea how it works, but I can speak for the results, and the lack of hair falling out in my comb and in the shower! Whether I&#x27;m growing new hair or not has yet to be determined, but I&#x27;m not losing anymore, which in my book is cause for joyous celebration. As long as I stay diligent in my new regimen it seems my hair isn&#x27;t going anywhere. Halle-frickin-lujah!</li>
    <li> Ultrax does it again! Finally a hair supplement that doesn&#x27;t promise magic, just delivers the good stuff. As a student of herbal medicine, I can confirm that they&#x27;ve done their homework. Nettle is one of the first things I&#x27;d recommend to anyone needing a boost with hair and nails. Combined with biotin, this is a powerful supplement.</li>
    <li> I wish I knew about this before. Within a week I got results</li>
    <li> This product is excellent! It works just as advertised. I appreciate that the product uses natural ingredients, including Keratin which is very helpful. It works fast and effectively to not only prevent hair loss but to retain hair strength for less breakage and thinning. I will recommend this to my close friends who struggle with hair loss or want thicker hair.</li>
    <li> These work fantastically. Absolutely worth the money. I&#x27;m noticing that my hair is much thicker and fuller now that I am taking these. It&#x27;s also growing a lot more quickly. Will definitely continue to take this supplement as it produces results.</li>
    <li> I used every kind of hair vitamin out there. Most made me sick or didn&#x27;t help at all. These vitamins pills were easy on my stomach. It helped with my extreme hair loss. I saw shedding slow down after only a week. I am very pleased with this brand. I have referred a few of my friends to try this product. I am a sold as a customer</li>
    <li> Surprisingly effective!  I&#x27;m always a little suspicious of supplements, but I have been pleasantly surprised.  What I noticed was that I stopped having as much hair fall out (in the shower, and on my hairbrush.)  When the hair droppage slowed/stopped, my hair looked much thicker.  My hair also looks healthier, i.e. shinier and in better condition.</li>
    <li> I have tried using a shampoo, conditioner and leave in spray for close to 2 years, with no noticeable changes. It helped slow down hair loss, but not by much and did nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been taking Hair maxx for about 2 1/2 months. Within the first 2 weeks I could see significant improvement in how much hair I was loosing in the shower and my hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within the 1 month I could feel my hair texture change. It&#x27;s much stronger and thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 2 1/2 months now I feel it&#x27;s pretty much the same - less hair loss and still thicker and stronger. I have been using less products to make my hair look better (volume, shine, etc), so that&#x27;s nice too! I do feel like my hair gets oiler quicker (but that could also be the hot summer weather too!). I&#x27;m going to take it for the six months, like they suggest. So hopefully I will see more improvement by the end. Actual new hair growth would be amazing and the only thing missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I am very happy with the results. Other than the oilyish hair, I see no other side affects. Taking it daily can be a pain, but definitely worth it in the end. I will stick with Hair Maxx for my hair supplement for now.</li>
    <li> I bought this product along with the Ultrax Labs Shampoo and I love it. My hair has been thinning in the top in the center of my scalp and I&#x27;ve been working to improve growth. This serum has helped to strength and spread roots. The Keratin provides a nice coating that makes my hair feel smooth. I color my hair and it&#x27;s helped with the split ends.</li>
    <li> Thank Goodness I found this! I normally lost 20+ hair in a shower but recently I lost over 65 hair from just conditioning my hair in shower. I was beyond freaked out. It is horrifying for a girl who love dressing up and playing with her long colored hair. I am not sure the hair loss is caused by the change of my birth control pill or by the constant bleaching and coloring, but this thing REALLY helped! I have only been taking this for a week but my hair already stopped losing at the third day! although I still lost 40+ hair when I condition my hair but well, it&#x27;s a big improvement, don&#x27;t you agree? I was so happy and grateful that I found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a little update:&lt;br /&gt;been taking it for two weeks now. I kept my eye on the number of the hair loss and now I realized I only lost around 30 hair when I condition my hair! this is awesome! Now I&#x27;ll focus on the growth, and I hope I will have good news for this review!</li>
    <li> I started to use it a couple of months ago after i noticed that my hair was falling down more than the average. And until now i&#x27;m satisfied with the results, i&#x27;m not saying that new hair appear where it didn&#x27;t but i&#x27;ve noticed that hair losing has stopped and even my hair looks healthy. I don&#x27;t have any idea how it works, It&#x27;s supposed to be a mixed of mineral, herbs and essential vitamins, but the key it seems to be keratin which helps to stop hair loss and increase hair thickness. Until now this is enough for me.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  After just a short time using this I have noticed a difference in hair loss in the shower and while styling.  My hair looks fuller and healthier and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> I was told about Ultrax Labs Hair loss blocking a month ago and have been using it ever since. i knew ahead of time that i would definitely have to wait a few weeks to really decipher weather this product was effective or not. I googled and looked up videos on youtube to have a visual of the results ahead of time and I must say i have noticed a huge difference in thickness of my hair. My hair has gotten fuller and I am honestly just so pleased. I&#x27;ve tried a few things here in there just because I&#x27;ve always been insecure about my hair and finally came across something that works. It takes time so just be patient and give it a chance. Trust me, you will not be disappointed. I also have seen a huge stop in shedding as well!</li>
    <li> I have now added this wonderful supplement to my list of products that really work and are worth the money I spend for them. the results are truly spectacular. I am so happy that I found this product and will continue using it for a long time to come. another hands down winner.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that I&#x27;ve tried that helps with hair that won&#x27;t grow past a certain length. My hair was &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; at my collarbone, and after some time, my hair is now about a half inch below my collarbone. Considering my hair has been the same length for almost a year, I consider this to be a win!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this 6 stars! I have never seen such amazing results so quickly. If you are starting to feel anxious about thinning hair, this product is for you.</li>
    <li> So I bought this as a skeptic. I saw the good reviews and thought... this stuff doesn&#x27;t really work, right? I mean, if they did, we wouldn&#x27;t see baldness in society. The problem is that these kinds of products take a long time to start working. We are talking weeks and sometimes months before any noticeable change has occurred. I can say that within three weeks of using the product, I am starting to see minor changes and hope that these changes become major changes over a years time. Great!</li>
    <li> Having just bought the Ultrax-Labs shampoo and finding it such a successful product so far, I was told the next best move to further ensure the growth and health of my hair was to get this amazing complement to the shampoo product. I am so pleased with the the Ultrax Labs product line and look forward to using them and reccomending in the future!</li>
    <li> In my case It doesn&#x27;t help to regrow hair, but makes individual hair thinker.</li>
    <li> This is a great product with essential Vitamins and of course Folate and Biotin. Both are esential for cell growth and stimulating the building blocks for growth and thickness. It also contains Keratin which helps with hair loss. &amp;#34;Hair Rush&amp;#34; produces a substantial difference in hair growth and thickness. Importantly this supplement produces no side effects. I highly recommend this product for results.</li>
    <li> It took about 3 months of use to notice a different, but I am losing much less hair with this product.  Before, when I shampooed, my hair was falling out in my hand.  Now, when I shampoo, there is a minimal amount of loss - no more than I had for years when shampooing.  Over all, I am happy with this product.  I plan to continue using it, even though I feel it is a bit pricey.  I found another product sold by Amazon that works just as well if not better for less than half the price.</li>
    <li> My hair has been slowly thinning out over the years, creating a bald spot on my head that I have been extremely embarressed of. I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every single hair product I could find that made a promise of regenerating my once lucious head of hair, only to find that these products were useless. However I didn&#x27;t give up my search to find a product that would actually restore my hair, and I finally found it when I tried this stuff! After about a month of using this product, I have found that my hair loss has actually stopped and hair is starting to grow back. Before I used this ultrax, I had to wear a baseball cap to cover my baldspot. Now, hair covers over my entire head and I am proud of my hair again. I love this product, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone trying to stop their hair loss.</li>
    <li> My husband has been taking the pills as directed for 2-3 months and has not noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> I bought this with pretty low expectations, considering how many hair loss treatments I&#x27;d tried. However, my best friend, who still has a great head of hair at 50, kept pushing it on me. I felt like I&#x27;d tried every other option under the sun, and his hair was looking fantastic, so I gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about three weeks, I thought it wasn&#x27;t working. Then, I was trimming my hair with the normal #2 all around, and noticed that it was taking more than a few quick swipes to do do the top of my head. Lo-and-behold, there were a few REAL dark, thick, not whispy, white, or clear hairs poking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it isn&#x27;t in my head, because about a month after that I started getting a few comments that I was looking younger, from my coworkers and girlfriend. Now, three months out, I&#x27;m starting to get enough regrowth that I may ditch the clippers and go for a scissor cut for the first time in years!</li>
    <li> My hair is definitely growing and getting thicker! This is my new favorite hair product. It works from the inside out!</li>
    <li> Been taking these supplements for almost two months now with shoija naturals hair stimulator and nioxin shampoo and have definitely noticed a difference in how healthy my hair is. The areas around my hairline seem to start having a small amount of regrowth already since I notice a fuzz of little hairs growing where there weren&#x27;t any before. Even my friends have commented on how much healthier my hair looks. I am impressed these work pretty good they might be expensive at 60 bucks a bottle but you get what you pay for since they are honestly the only thing I have used so far that has given me any significant regrowth around my hairline. I&#x27;m excited and hope that I get most of my hair to regrow back since I already have little baby hairs where I was bald before.</li>
    <li> Great buy, Friend used it, and saw results in no time, if you don&#x27;t wish to go bald, buy this immediately, you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
    <li> This product is really good and I like it because it really stimilates hair growth.  After taking it for like a month hair isnt as thin and grows real thick.  It looks more healthy and is shiny.  I been having thinning hair for some time and this product really helps and grows new growth fast.  I am thinking about refering some of my friends.  There is also less shedding.</li>
    <li> i started noticing my hair was getting thinner and looking unhealthy. I heard about this product and bought some. I took the pills everyday and before I knew it, my hair has become so much thicker and has grown a few inches!  Love this stuff and definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Seeing results from this treatment.Very good and easy to use!!!Bomb of vitamins to regrow your hair and also makes them look stronger and healthier.Definitely will get more in the future!!!Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> The Keratin works great! Love this</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how but this product truly works! I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now, and I can already start to see changes. I&#x27;ve been losing hair in the middle of my scalp for some time now but after using this, I&#x27;m starting to get my confidence back. I recommend this product to anyone looking to stop hair loss.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Been using this product for almost 4 months. My barber is now asking where did this new growth come from. Still have a ways to go, but this along with Jamaican Black Castor Oil and Lipogaine have revived, multiplied, and thickened the troubled area. Will continue!</li>
    <li> OMG. Thanks to Hair Rush my thinning hair is starting to get thicker with fewer split ends and the frizziness is gone! But the best part is that after noticing my results, my wife started using the product. She was having to endure the embarrassment of her hair being so thin you could see her scalp. This is so much worse for women than men. So I ordered Hair Rush just for her. What a difference. She not only looks better, she is happier and has regained her self confidence. It&#x27;s just wonderful to feel rejuvenated again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after doing a lot of research. I had completely damaged my hair from over processing, and it was becoming thinner, and my hair line started to recede. I started taking this product 3 months ago, the first thing I noticed was how oily my hair became, and that was within the  first 24 hours of taking the supplement. I didn&#x27;t notice any other changes for awhile, only my hair was becoming healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a month I noticed I wasn&#x27;t shedding as much...  But now I can see a BIG difference in my hair texture.  Someone had sent me a picture of myself and it was 90 days to  the day and I was like WOW !! I completely noticed how thick  my hairline had gotten.So yesterday I compared a picture of my hair from about 4  months ago and it was a HUGE difference !! No more receding  hair line and my hair is fuller and has lots of shine !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the bottom line is YES this product works , you just have  to give it time, and as for the growth rate.. I didn&#x27;t notice  a huge growth spurt at first but in 5 weeks my hair grew an  inch when it usually grows half that !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep taking hair maxx as long as its available and I hope it never goes away.</li>
    <li> I bought it to improve the volume of my hair. Taking it for a month already and I do think it works. Thanks.</li>
    <li> If you want to get a good quality just like this product, try the beautifully bamboo for only $16 that you can buy here in amazon. Hair Rush/max pills for me is wayyyyy overprice.</li>
    <li> The product truly works. Be patient for the results takes at least 30 days before you see results. I have combined the product with Ovation hair shampoo and cell therapy.</li>
    <li> Made my hair look healthier!</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx help hair follicles to function properly by BLOCKING the production of DHT (Dihydrotestosterone) within the body that prevents hair growth.  Prevent the production of DHT that shrink hair follicles which slows down hair growth.  Preventing hair follicle damage from the inside aids in hair follicle circulation to grow hair. The more hair follicles that work properly produce a thicker head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx Supplement help hair follicles to function more properly to reproduce hair regularly.  Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx Supplement will help you keep the hair you have and help to reproduce hair you lost.  I give the Ultrax products a thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I already own a few other Ultra Labs products &amp; have been so impressed with the results I decided to try this supplement to help with the thinning hair at the crown of my head.After about a month I&#x27;ve noticed less hair loss after showering. Interestingly, my nails are also stronger, don&#x27;t break as easily as they did before. I plan on continuing to use this product!</li>
    <li> This is one of Ultrax Labs great products. I started taking this supplement about 30 days ago, since the life of a hair cell is about 21 days I wanted to give this a full month (4-5 weeks) to kick in, but within 2-3 weeks of daily use I already noticed a difference. I received compliments about the nice shine of my hair from friends and clients who I see on a weekly basis... personally I can feel the thickness of my color treated, heat treated, dead hair coming back, which is what I was hoping for. I used to have a really thick head of hair, and recently have been losing it more in the shower and while brushing. I have tried other supplements like Horse Tail, Biotin and Nails/ Hair vitamin blends before, with no relief or benefit. This is unique because it contains a blend of essential vitamins and minerals in the appropriate amounts, with herbs such as Nettle leaf, Keratin and Ginkgo biloba. It does not provide over 100% of any of the vitamins which is great because mega-doses are not always the answer!! Being a nutritionist, I am very careful about which supplements, vitamins and herbs I put in my body- this one is certainly great and encompasses everything that I need!  I am nearing the end of my bottle and will be ordering a second one soon!</li>
    <li> In terms of value, I&#x27;m giving this 2 stars because of the price. $60 every month is way too much. There are others similar to this out there that are half this price and probably work just as well if not better.</li>
    <li> This DHT blocking product is amazing. I was skeptical about take a non topical supplement but was pleasantly surprised. The only problem is that you have to keep taking it. But if the alternative is to let my hair continue to thin and watch my hairline recede into the sunset. Not me!!!! Compared to other pricey options this is the way to go!</li>
    <li> Taking these pills has noticeably improved the strength of my hair and caused fewer hairs to fall out. I feel confident that the ingredients are doing a great job and that they will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> Received this as a gift.  They seemed to take a long time before I saw any growth but after a few months the shedding stopped altogether and noticed new growth on my hairline.  It works.</li>
    <li> My hair seemed to fall out more using this product. I was not fond of it and it did not work well for me at all.</li>
    <li> I must say, I am impressed with this product.  I frequently have to vacuum since my floor is always covered with my long hair and it drives me nuts. I have noticed a difference with Ultrax.  My hair has been feeling thicker and more lustrous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about growing hair in unwanted areas, but so far, so good!  I also like that this supplement is not a prescription-strength, pharmaceutical drug that would give me tons of side effects.  I will be sure to continue purchasing since I am paranoid about losing the thick hair that Ultrax has given me.</li>
    <li> Great Natural Product! Having hair again and knowing hair loss is decreased is a great confidence builder.&lt;br /&gt;I Love it because it contains the keratin protein which  supply structural support  for my hair cells.&lt;br /&gt;It also contains lots of essential minerals and vitamins that promotes hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to my friends</li>
    <li> Pros- Easy to digest tabs&lt;br /&gt;Cons- non yet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am new to using this product but like the formulation.  There is 50% biotion and 25% folate in 2 tabs.  This powerpacked tab has everything to promote hair growth.  After pregnancy my hair changed drastically.  I am glad that I&#x27;ve found something that is going to give me fuller, lush hair.</li>
    <li> So using this with the shampoo produced such amazing results. I havent even been using them both for a full two weeks and Im already loving the feeling from my hair when I run my fingers through it. If your thinking about trying it, I suggest YES!</li>
    <li> The Ultra Labs supplement has been working wonders for my hair. The capsules are easy to swallow and give you a boost of energy. It&#x27;s best to take them with a meal and not on an empty stomach. The supplement has a made a huge difference with my hair  - it is much healthier and thicker. It&#x27;s perfect for anyone who has thinning hair or bald spots.  It contains Biotin, which is also know to promote hair growth.</li>
    <li> I have used this for about 2 months and have noticed a significant change.  Less hair in my drain and a fuller hairline.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I used the shampoo from Ultrax and I wanted even more boosting hair growth powers so I got this too! I&#x27;m so happy that I did.  My hair has never been thicker and longer.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Saw fast results and I&#x27;m so happy I found this stuff!</li>
    <li> I tried this regularly for 4 months.  I followed the instructions to the letter.  There was no discernible change.  This may work for others, but it did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> Great product for anyone looking to recover from thinning or hair loss. I have always had thin hair but as I approach my 40&#x27;s I was starting to notice that my hair was starting to thin out even more. The thought of my hair being even thinner was frightful so I turned to the internet for help. I came across Ultrax Labs Hair Rush about a month ago and after going through the reviews I decided to give it a chance. After all, I had nothing to lose except for more hair! After about a weeks worth of use I noticed I wasn&#x27;t shedding as much and my hair line and my nails and complexion began to look nicer.  A few weeks later my hairline began to grow little frizzies and my hair was shinier and looked healthy again! I am beyond satisfied with Ultrax and highly recommend it to anyone suffering from thinning and hair loss.</li>
    <li> Overall the Ultrax Hair Maxx seems to be working. My hair is definitely not falling out - though this wasn&#x27;t a huge problem I dealt with. Still, it does seem to be growing at least a little faster. Certainly better than not using anything at all. There&#x27;s no bad odor or taste, plus it&#x27;s much smaller than a lot of horse pills out there. I always take pills on a full stomach, so I don&#x27;t get nauseous and that works in this case too. I&#x27;ll definitely need to check this out long term, but so far, so good!</li>
    <li> Before you blow money on a product like this just visit a dermatologist.  Obviously most people don&#x27;t have the insurance, time, or money to just visit a doctor, but if you&#x27;re thinking about getting this product instead of visiting a professional just save your money.  This did not work and I can&#x27;t really imagine it working for anyone who is losing their hair.  Maybe it&#x27;ll make for a healthy boost to hair, skin and nails, but if you&#x27;re expecting this to stop or reverse hair loss I have a bridge to sell you.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an all-natural product to make my hair grow from within (instead of topical) like a daily vitamin. I&#x27;ve been taking these vitamins and have noticed a significant change . It has both Biotin and Keratin-the best key ingredients for making your hair grow rapidly and to help strengthen it. Has over 20 vitamins and herbs (not chemicals) like Zinc and Saw Palmetto, notorious for regrowing hair, strengthening and helping baldness. My baby hairs around my face have been growing in and has much more fullness than before. YAY!</li>
    <li> Ultra Labs products always looks, feels and does works. I used shampoo theirs and i knew one eventually to work. These tablets of Ultra Labs great way to build new hair to loss hair have. Over time you should see change hair growth, as I too have seen. That hair where lies bold spots, should eventually overtime should be no more, hair that look of hair growth once again, you once.loved. Tell you Ultra Labs puts their hard time their products, you can just tell by use each product, just great response comes each time. Love Ultra Labs products. Must those need hair growth no time.</li>
    <li> I started using this product about 3 weeks ago, taking it with breakfast daily. Since beginging to use Ultrax my hair has become significantly healthier, i am definitely looking forward to future results!</li>
    <li> This product is a natural extra strength formula contains Keratin and 23 essential vitamins all of which are beneficial to hair growth. A  must-buy for those struggling with hair loss - scalp becomes more populated, stronger hair also!</li>
    <li> Great product! I bought it to my mother and she&#x27;s happy about it! Totaly recomend it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this in conjunction with the shampoo, and I must say, I noticed a significant difference in the thickness and fullness of my hair almost immediately.  I could feel circulation in my scalp increase within days of application and saw regrowth of hair within two weeks.  My hair became thicker and fuller as more time passed.  Moreover, I did NOT notice any irregular or abnormal hair growth, even in spots that accidentally got some applied onto (hands, face, etc.).  I would recommend this product on it&#x27;s own, but better if used with the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I was so used tp see my hair all over my shower that it was impossible not to realize that I was no longer losing my hair! I started taking this supplement religiously and it really works! I was very surprised to see my hair growing back again and not falling! I recommend this product 100%!</li>
    <li> WOW, this stuff is AWESOME.  I have been using it for about 18months regularly as directed. I can&#x27;t begin to tell how awesome this stuff has worked. I had new growth in about 4 months (small little peach fuzzy stuff) and now my had is as thick and long as it&#x27;s ever been. I turned my hairdresser on to it and she is also having great success. Really happy with this product, despite the cost, it has really helped me regain my hair again and I am soooooo Thrilled!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be patient with this, it takes some time; but if you hang in there, you might find yourself as amazed as I am. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how sick I am of throwing money away on hair loss treatments that DON&#x27;T WORK! I&#x27;m ecstatic to say that this is not the case with Ultra Labs hair loss pills!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took some time, but after using this treatment for awhile I started to notice baby hairs regrowing on the scant parts of my scalp. It&#x27;s unbelievable! This is now the only hair loss product I will spend any kind of money on….and it&#x27;s worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone, like me, who is fed up on spending $$$$$$$$$$ on hair loss treatments that don&#x27;t work. Look no further, you&#x27;ve found your solution!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so nice to have a pill I can take and regrow hair! Honestly, the wonders of modern medicine. I&#x27;m so pleased with this product. I started taking it a few weeks ago and have noticed new hairs popping out all over my head. I&#x27;m getting a thick, luscious head of hair, and all I had to do was take a pill. I&#x27;m so excited a about how my hair will look in a few more weeks. I really have no idea how this works or how it targets the top of your head, but it does. I will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Ultrax Labs Hair Rush for about 3 weeks now and the amount of hair I was losing reduced drastically. It is giving me healthier, stronger and thicker hair! The vitamins in this product are working and my hair hasn&#x27;t looked this good in awhile. I recommend and am really happy with this product. It has been completely worth it for me. Just the other day a friend told me she thought my hair looked thicker and full. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> As my second product from Ultrax Labs, I definitely find them a promising company. The supplements worked excellently with satisfying result and I look forward to purchasing it again to stock up.</li>
    <li> This provides fast results, after the first bottle you can see a difference. Contains several essential vitamins that are healthy for your entire body, which may be why you see such great results so fast. Less expensive using Ultrax Hair Rush then seeing a hair specialist who may require methods not so healthy for the body and is much more expensive.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It starts working right away. I combine this with the caffeine surge shampoo and it works even better. The price is minimal compared to other products and is much easier then using a lotion or gel. I highly recommend this product for anyone with hair loss or thin hair issues.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s helping but not 100% sure yet.</li>
    <li> I can assure you that my 5 star review is not fake. I am getting ready to order 2 more bottles. My hair continues to grow in thicker. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months now. I am convinced that Hair Maxx has made a difference for my thinning hair problem. However, everyone is different. There are different causes for hair loss. I know it is working for me! My original review is below....&lt;br /&gt;I am so grateful to have found this product. I&#x27;ve been taking Hair Maxx faithfully for four months and just ordered 2 more bottles. I had lost half my hair within a few months after going off Yaz. It was absolutely mortifying watching globs and globs of my hair clog the shower drain, fill up my brush bristles and ball up in the clean laundry. Now, I have new growth springing up, and the thin spots are less noticeable. My stylist continues to comment on how much better it looks and feels, however, I have a long way to go to get my original thickness back. I will certainly continue to take my 2 Hair Maxx tablets every morning and enjoy cleaning up a few strands from the shower drain. A dramatic improvement. An answer to my prayers! I recommend to anyone experiencing hair loss.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all.  Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product works awesome. Ive been using it for two month now and can notice a difference in my hair. No more shedding.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Rush DHT Blocking Hair Loss Maxx Hair Growth seems to be a good product, the real deal in helping to halt hair loss. Hair becomes shinier and stronger after the use of this supplement as well. My favorite part about Hair Rush it is the all natural ingredient list, this is the most attractive feature to me. You can&#x27;t go wrong when the ingredients are natural and healthy, for hair and also for skin. The combination of ingredients used to create this supplement work together, so instead of taking various vitamins separately, say for blocking hair loss and to strengthen hair, all you need is this supplement. I love that nettles are included in the mix! I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My hair is thinning already so I’m trying to do everything I can to keep it from getting worse… I’ve done some research about thinning hair/hair loss and the different nutrients that may help with that. Hair Maxx checks out – it has a lot of ingredients that I’ve read about that are supposed to be good for hair growth and so far it seems to be helping! I am taking other vitamins and supplements for hair growth as well, but when I started taking Hair Maxx it seemed to kick things up a notch.</li>
    <li> My hair had been thinning on top and this AMAZING product has not only stopped that but has started to reverse the thinning! I&#x27;m getting my hair back!!! Plus my hair is thickening!!&lt;br /&gt;I love HAIR MAXX!</li>
    <li> I brought this product a while ago for my dad and uncles suffering with aging hair loss. Prior to the initial treatment, we did ask our primary doctor regarding the product&#x27;s safety and we were all clear as the ingredients were natural. Losing 40-60 strands of hair became a regular occurrence for the men in our household. My dad had been on the product for exactly 4 weeks; it took the product about two weeks to see its very first sign of results. From losing 40-60 strands of hair per wash to losing about 20-40 strands. By the third week, it number of hair lost was about 15-35 strands depending on the days of the week. The 4th week of treatment marked the growth of new tiny strands of hair growing in apparent previous balding spots. While I think it may take  longer than 4 weeks to see the results of this product entirely, 4 weeks is enough to see the very first stage of the problem being repaired.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying my results from this product. Around 35 my hair started falling out in massive amounts and I didn&#x27;t know why. I had several doctors tell me it was everything from stress to hormone imbalances. I started taking this product and I can already tell the difference. I have used other products recommended by stylists like Mane &amp; Tail and other extreme products with little help. I am completely encouraged and can&#x27;t wait to have more great results to share. It is more than a pricey bottle of shampoo and conditioner but definitely worth it. Like everything else in the world, you get what you pay for. I will definitely be purchasing more of this product.</li>
    <li> This hair growth loss nutrient vitamin supplement is very helpful and amazing .It work for both young and older people with thin hair . I would recommend it for anybody with any bold spot or any problem with your hairline and edges . Fast result is expected .It helped to stop shedding hair. In the beginning it made shedding slow down, then it made it stop. Your hair will definitely get thicker and healthier than before. You won&#x27;t know how but it works . Hair will also become longer over time . After all this product is definitely helpful .</li>
    <li> I have been taking 1 a day for 3 months (only on weekdays) and I&#x27;ve noticed my hair grows SO much faster. I&#x27;ve had it trimmed twice already and my stylist (which is also my sister!) is shocked at how fast it&#x27;s growing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been dealing with hair shedding/thinning due to hormonal changes and it hasn&#x27;t helped with that, but it does make the new hair that&#x27;s coming in grow much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Added bonus, my nails have become very strong and long which I have never had in my life and my eyelashes are very long.like false lashes! I will continue to take these as I love the results!</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my boyfriend, he loves it!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to complement my earlier purchase of the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge with Caffeine Shampoo. I have been taking this supplement for a couple of months now. I bought it because I wanted fuller, thicker hair. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was making much difference or if I would have to wait for few months to see results. I am happy to say that within a couple of weeks, I started noticing a lot of new growth hair. Two months on, I can see lots of new growth in the front, now a couple of inches long. I am not sure how this would do for everyone but it worked for me. To conclude, if your hair is fine or if you want to grow it faster and thicker, then this is the solution.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always really suspicious when there&#x27;s so many 4-5 star ratings. Especially when it comes to stuff that can easily be bunk (like hair growth products). But my hair was starting to thin out at 23 and I found myself desperate, so I took the risk to buy Hair Maxx because genuine buyers were also giving it glowing reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small backstory: The one thing that always made me feel disheartened is when I rub my hair in the shower and my hands would come away with a bunch of shedding hairs. I ignored it for the longest time, but eventually I could SEE my scalp. I sucked it up and bought a bottle of this product over a period of a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh my god.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, my nails got ridiculously strong and grew really fast. I&#x27;m a nail biter (yeah yeah, I can feel your judgment from here) and I recently bit so low to the point where it hurt -- a struggle other nail biters would be all too familiar with. Typically it takes about a few days for the nail to regrow past the painful point. Taking this product, it regrows past the painful point practically overnight. Only downfall I also keep scratching my partner by accident. Mildly annoying, but definitely not enough to lower the star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part about this product is that I used to have so much hair stick my hands when conditioning it. Now after rubbing my hair, I rarely see more than three strands. My thinning hair just stopped thinning. Over the last couple months I&#x27;ve been really careful not to harshly rub it with a towel and I got some really good non-sulfate shampoo/conditioner. Being more conscious and careful with handling my hair in conjunction with Hair Maxx, I am now really relieved with how much less I can see my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully we&#x27;ll get a cure for hair loss soon, but until then looks like I&#x27;m out 60 bucks every month. But with my head shape, it really beats being bald. If you&#x27;re willing to part with 60 bucks a month for something that will likely slow downyour hair shedding, I really recommend you buy it.  See if it works for you as well as it does for me.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle after having taken the supplement for a month and I am amazed by the results in such a short period.  I don&#x27;t have traditional baldness like most guys do, my head is generally full of hair, but there is a visible area on the very top of my head in the center/right section that was losing hair.  When combing hair after showering, what would show as a very prominent area of missing hair is now far less pronounced.  It&#x27;s incredible, obviously it&#x27;s not totally back to being like the rest of the hair on my head, but the progress in just 4-5 weeks has been awesome.  I look forward continuing this for the next month</li>
    <li> For a number of years, I have had difficulty getting my hair to grow which resulted in a lot of angst when there was a cutting error at the beauty parlor. I struggled to keep my hair the same style and length out of fear that it would take forever to grow back. However, the nutrients that are found in the Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx supplement have reduced my anxiety. These nutrients help my hair grow at a normal rate and I am at a point where I actually need to make appointments to get my hair cut because it is growing quickly enough to need shaped back into a nice style.&lt;br /&gt;Great side effects from these nutrients surprisingly include longer and stronger fingernails as well as a much happier, less clogged, shower drain!!!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the nutrients in this supplement - they are easy to take and have no adverse side effects. The only negative aspect for me is the cost seems a little high, but, overall, having great hair is worth it.</li>
    <li> Hair rush has a powerful combination of vitamins and minerals. Many of them contains nutrients that make up our hair follicles, such as Keratin. It contains ingredients to balance chemical changes that causes hair loss.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different products that have claimed to restore hair loss, but none of them have worked like this one. Other products stopped my hair loss, but didn&#x27;t restore it; still others made my hair grow again but didn&#x27;t stop it from falling out. My hair grows back in and stays on my head now - thanks, Ultrax Labs!</li>
    <li> This specific hair loss supplement was recommended to me by a friend. He knew I was having trouble with massive amounts of hair loss, and he said this stuff works for him. I was hesitant due to the cost, so he bought me my first bottle as a gift. Now I&#x27;m buying it for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I started taking this Ultrax stuff the amount of hair that I pull out of the shower drain has decreased quite a lot. I&#x27;ve only taken it for 1 month, but I definitely notice the difference. I&#x27;ve also noticed my nails don&#x27;t split as easily and seem much stronger. I don&#x27;t have a history of thinning hair in my family, so I can&#x27;t speak for people who are trying to reverse genetic or male/female pattern baldness. I feel certain my hair loss was due to something lacking in my diet. If you think this might be the reason behind your hair loss, then try this!</li>
    <li> This product works great! I was suffering from hair thinning and loss. For a while I was worried nothing would work and took many different types of supplements as well as hair therapies, and nothing changed. I tried Ultrax Lalbs and after about a month or so my hair stopped falling! I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I purchase this product. My hair never got thick or full. But one thing I did notice that it help my energy level. if you know what I mean. But it didn&#x27;t help my hair in anything.</li>
    <li> It did not do anything , such wast of money !!.</li>
    <li> This has an amazing blend of vitamins and herbs that are not only great for you hair but great for your body as well.  I have studied herbs on an amateur level and I can tell you that the makers of this product really put a lot of thought into why and what they wanted to put in there.  It really is all about the combination of herbs when making any formula and they really put everything you could possibly want in there.  These vitamins and herbs are just great for your body as well so there is the added effect of just staying healthy on a regular basis as well.  Having ginkgo and the bioflavanoids are great antioxidants as well.  All around a great product!!!</li>
    <li> I used hair surge shampoo and a keratin treatment to get results the combination seems to halt the hairloss. Decided to add an  oral keratin supplement to the mix. Been using this for 6  weeks now...There is some hairgrowth as well now&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seemed that i needed a hair supplement to boost the effects of what I have been doing otherwise. Results got slightly better now.I will keep up with this  regiment for some time as I am pleased with the results Ive  experienced. Ive been taking 2 tables a day as directed. Easy to swallow supplement.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I suffer from Alopecia which makes my hair fall out in random, sudden patches.  I was devastated when over the summer, a huge bald spot became apparent right above my forehead.  I started taking Biotin and Vitamin D religiously but neither of them helped.  I was taking up to 5000 mcg of Biotin daily as I was desperate but I started breaking out with acne even though I tend to have very predictable, generally clear skin.  So I quit Biotin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I could no longer hide the one killer bald spot anymore, I decided to give this vitamin a whirl and am honestly shocked at how in just 6 weeks, baby hairs are growing back in that one prominent spot...so much so that I can now pin my hair back again!!!!  &#x3D;)  I usually hate taking vitamins but this one is easy to swallow.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how the rest of my bald spots are hopefully treated with this wonder vitamin.</li>
    <li> This Hair Loss Block / Regrowth treatment has been EXCELLENT for me.  Its a month treatment and before the first month was over for me I had a significant growth in thickness and length of my hair.  Throughout the last six months it has continued to produce results for me and has filled some bald spots that I thought would never see hair again.  This has been a huge confidence builder for me, I&#x27;ll absolutely continue to GET my hair back!!</li>
    <li> Beauty begins internally. If your internal health is not in balance it reflects on the outside with poor skin &amp; hair health  being prime. This supplement works directly with your with body&#x27;s internal chemistry to produce hair vitality, strength, and luster. Not only does it contain essential nutrients such as Biotin &amp; other vitamins that many other products contain to help with skin, hair &amp; nail health, but 3 components that are all natural &amp; scientifically proven to produce results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Nettle Leaf Powder - studies indicate that it promotes hair regrowth, thickens hair, and add shine&lt;br /&gt;2. Pumpkin Seed Powder - pumpkin seeds contain high levels of antioxidants, therefore, aid in reducing the the damaging effects of free radicals to the hair follicle&lt;br /&gt;3. Saw Palmetto - Dr. Andrew Weil promotes this as being key in hair regrowth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combine this internal regimen with use of the other Ultrax Labs Shampoos &amp; Conditioners, you will see your hair health improving. Expect to see your hair growing, thickening, and shining!!! Finally, a product that helps with fine &amp; life-less looking hair!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff works amazingly better than I ever dreamed. Not only did I see results in about two weeks, but I have been taking them now for a month and my hair has grown almost over one and a half inches!!! Don&#x27;t take my word for it, but you have to try it to see the results for yourself.</li>
    <li> I was glad, upon receiving this product, to see that the pills are small, easy to take and DONT SMELL.  Its a lot of different vitamins, which often times makes for a bottle of pills that smell like dog food. These do not.  Its a small, oval, white pill with no odor and no taste, either.  That was definitely something that made me like this product.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that it felt all around &#x27;heavier&#x27; than it normally does.  It isnt falling out as easily (when normally I have clumps of it at the bottom of the tub), strands arent accumulating in my hairbrush at an alarming volume, and it generally feels stronger when pulling at it. (I have trichotillomania, a hair pulling disorder that is rapidly causing baldness.) So that is a good thing.  This is a product that I would definitely recommend!  The ONLY thing I would change is to make the bottle child-proof.  I don&#x27;t know if it would hurt kids or not, (I think anything would in a large amount...), but its a normal bottle with a screw-off lid.  Other than that, great!</li>
    <li> Terrific. This product is very good and my hair stopped falling as 85%. my hair is growing more and is thicker and healthier. I&#x27;m on my the 2nd bottle.</li>
    <li> It shipped quickly, goes down easy with some fluids if you can&#x27;t swallow pills very well- plus its relatively a small pill anyway for all of the nutrients inside of it. People keep worrying about fake reviews, but the nutrients in these pills are just the simple basics for what you need for hair growth! I would highly recommend this to anyone with thinning hair, or maybe whom just want thicker hair than they have now.</li>
    <li> I was inspired by my last purchase of Ultralax Labs caffeine shampoo to try more from the brand. These vitamins are wonderful and help not only your hair growth, but your nail strength and overall complexion. Since they contain Biotin, its no surprise. I also love that these are Made in the USA. These are a great supplement to the shampoo and I am really excited for healthier hair.</li>
    <li> This product will help you to regrow your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets face it, there are tons of products promising to help you regrow your hair.  Some of these products deliver on their promise.  problem is that most of us will not give the product the time or the opportunity to work.  It is easy to say a product doesn&#x27;t work if we do not properly follow the directions or do as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is no different.  If you follow the directions and do what it says you can experience a change in the way in which your hair grows and in the length and depth to which it grows but you must follow the directions and do what it says. If you do not you can not experience it&#x27;s positive effects, just follow the directions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I know what this product can do and I&#x27;m experiencing the results for myself.  Do what it says and you too may be posting a review like this, if not then you only have yourself to blame.  I like the product, it does what it says it will do and I&#x27;m happy with the results.  Test it for yourself and see what happens!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you&#x27;ll be amazed at the results!</li>
    <li> I got this for my mother who suffers from hair loss due to medication. She started this vitamin 2 weeks ago and absolutely loves this product. She says that her hair seems to be stronger and shinier. Her nails are stronger and don&#x27;t chip as easily as they used to. This product accompanied by the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge is a great bang for the buck. You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> I have only been using the product for the past two weeks, so I have not yet seen any difference in my hair. I was also not experiencing any significant hair loss, so that may account for why I have not noticed a difference. I will have to see what happens in the next couple of weeks to make a better determination.</li>
    <li> Everybody experiences hair growth at a different rate. What we eat, how we take care of ourselves, what we use for shampoo and genetics all play a factor. Majority of any product you use - you will notice their websites claim that you should see a difference after a month. I&#x27;m a very impatient person, so of course I go to the extreme with a product on trying to increase my hair growth and very particular with the type of products I use and how they hold up to their promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before beginning any new haircare product I always get a good trim and measure my hair when it&#x27;s flat ironed then I don&#x27;t flat iron or blow dry for an entire month. I follow a strict regimen when it comes to my hair care methods because for (1) its money spent and (2) extra time taking supplements, massaging my scalp etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s almost a month now and I can hardly wait to measure my new progress. My fianc&amp;eacute; has noticed its extremely soft, which before it was dry and needing lots of moisturizer. I was anticipating changing my dark brown hair and going a little lighter for the summer and my wedding but I&#x27;m afraid the harsh chemicals from dying my hair will interrupt my progress. I&#x27;m not a fan of placebo effect either - hence why I go to the extreme with the right moisturizer, washing cycle, shampoo and conditioner, deep conditioning treatments and good diet Icannot stress enough... GOOD DIET... Also I am a non-smoker but I am very anemic and do take iron supplements as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are all my tricks that I employ to ensure my hair is growing at its top speed. Taking these supplements twice a day as recommended I know are helping significantly due to the growth on my fingernails and toenails. My shedding has definitely stopped. And the supplements are not as bad or difficult to swallow compared to others that I&#x27;ve had issues with such as size of the pill and smell. I have had no problems taking Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx, exactly at the same time everyday. I carry them in my purse so I don&#x27;t miss a dose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually supplements work best the longer you take them, I say 3-6 months depending how compliant the individual is. I know this product works for me and truly recommend it to anyone desperately seeking new hair growth or wanting to change the texture of their hair from dry shedding, split ends to more healthier shiny manageable hair. Hope you have the same experience as I had!purse so I don&#x27;t miss a dose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually supplements work best the longer you take them, I say 3-6 months depending how compliant the individual is.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while and I believe this is the best hair growth supplement on the market. I&#x27;ve been struggling to manage my thin, brittle hair for years with little results. Thanks to Hair Maxx my hair is not only super full and thick but it&#x27;s so soft and manageable. I would recommend this product to anyone struggling with thin, fine hair like mine.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this with my hair care products and I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d see any difference since I don&#x27;t normally take supplements. After a few weeks you can see improvement so definitely worth the try. My hair feels fuller and a lot healthier now :)</li>
    <li> Thin hair runs in the family...but this product helps assure that that problem doesn&#x27;t happen to me. After 3-4 weeks, you will notice the difference. Ultrax Labs doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> This product has helped greatly my loss of hair.  I suffer from thyroid issues and was very concerned at the amount of hair loss I was experiencing.  Hair Rush has brought it to a halt.  It is pricey, but it does what it says, and fast.  Another great product is Hairomega and it&#x27;s cheaper, but Hair Rush  is easier to take because it does not have that B vitamin odor that I find very offensive and so difficult to swallow.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 weeks now, and I can already see results.  My hair isn&#x27;t shedding as much, and there is lots of new hair growth.  This is fantastic because I have thin hair, so it will definitely be thicker.  This is not an over-night product, it does take some time.  And I&#x27;ve been using it with their Hair Surge Caffeine shampoo.  Both of these have been great and I have seen so much improvement!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from Amazon and was amazed how little hair loss I have had since using this almost a week ago. This is an all natural Keratin based vitamin supplement that is taken with food once a day. Two tablets once a day and I have seen a difference in my hair. As I have aged I have experienced a lot of hair loss. I am used to seeing a handful almost every time I shampoo. Since I have started this supplement I do not experience hair shedding nor have I had as much hair loss as normal. My nails look better and I anticipate zero loss in another week! I would definitely recommend this product !!!</li>
    <li> Usually I&#x27;m not big on supplements but I figured if it could help my hair, why not try it. Well after a short amount of time, ive noticed a lot of little baby fine hairs starting to grow. I know its only a start but the product is working and i am very surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has helped my hair growth and so far I can say its a great product.</li>
    <li> i was very plased on how fast it got to me and how it was packaged. i would recomened this product to anyone that needs it for hair loss.</li>
    <li> Works wonder.  Bought it for a friend and the results were amazing.  I would recommend this product to everyone who is dealing with hair loss problem.  It stops the hair loss process and gradually improvement is shown.</li>
    <li> For the past few months, I have been noticing more and more hair in the shower drain and in my hairbrush. I have a family history of thinning hair, so after reading all the excellent reviews, I decided to give this product a shot. I have noticed a remarkable difference. I have also noticed a drastic reduction in the amount of hair I lose in the shower. I have even noticed new hair growing in. I have not had any negative side effects. This product really works and I would recommend it to anyone interested in not only preventing hair loss, but also stimulating new growth.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical of all the products that claim to regrow your hair. But after mine started to go I figured it was time to do something about it. This stuff really works! My hairline stopped receding really quickly, and it actually seems as if it&#x27;s starting to come back even stronger! It&#x27;s really nice to know that I don&#x27;t have to just accept my hair going away. This stuff makes me feel great.</li>
    <li> I had high hope for this product for its unbelievable reviews. But it didn’t do anything for me after 5 months. Most of reviewers are either without any reviewing history, or without Amazon verified purchase, or giving raving 5 star reviews for all of the products of this seller, which should have had raised a red flag for me. I was fooled. I hope you won’t.</li>
    <li> Love this pills they really work !!! I will continue using them for as long they available not cheap but worth the price.</li>
    <li> i took it when i was a smoker, and still saw a little difference. however , i quit smoking, and when i started using this, i noticed hair growth in just a week. it&#x27;s great, i give it one less star because its expensive and doesnt work on smokers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had hair thinning issues since I was in my early teens and I&#x27;ve tried everything from special shampoo&#x27;s to concealers. I was skeptical so believe me when I say that I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes when I found little baby hairs sprouting from the crown and temple areas of my head! Not only that but there&#x27;s less hairs in my bathroom sink and shower drain. I would recommend this supplement because what have you got to lose? It&#x27;s 100% guaranteed or your money back!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who was balding in his mid twenties. He has been taking it now and he says he is seeing some regrowth. I can feel a difference when I run my fingers through his hair. It makes him feel better and that&#x27;s what matters to me. This works for us.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It stops hair from breaking and definitely makes hair shinier. Hair also feels fuller and bouncier after using this product.</li>
    <li> the best supplement for hairloss I have taken..have tried almost all biotin and vitamins from supplement shops and thank god I found this !!</li>
    <li> This product is one of the best ideas I have heard of to prevent hair loss. The&lt;br /&gt;100% guarantee is important and I can&#x27;t wait to use this product.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift- am told it works great!</li>
    <li> I  have tried every hair growth products, this is the one I&#x27;m very surprised. I saw my hair started to grow for a while. Yea, you know that. It&#x27;s important</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other Keratin products and treatments but the results quickly dissipate unless you maintain it with a strict daily regimen. After using the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge, I started taking the Hair Rush vitamins also. I noticed more resiliency in my hair with less breakage and shedding. It felt strong like you see in the demos in haircare commercials. It seems to work on my hair from the inside out and I&#x27;ve noticed that the products I normally use worked better once my hair got stronger. I take the Hair Rush with my normal multivitamin and there are no issues. If you&#x27;re on the fence about it, at least try out one bottle but I think you will quickly reorder.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older I found that my hair is getting thinner and thinner. I always loved to keep my hair short but it really showed how thin my hair was getting. I tried all kinds of products and a friend recommended this. I thought it was a little expensive but finally said to heck with it and figured I&#x27;d give it a try. It took a few weeks to start actually seeing a result. My hair started to get thicker again. I noticed I couldn&#x27;t see as much of my scalp as before. Definitely going to keep using and see how it goes.</li>
    <li> This was way better than i expected. All i have to say is AMAZING, you have to try this!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, hair grows really fast and not as much coming out.  Does not make hair thicker or regrow hair but makes it stronger and grow faster.</li>
    <li> In two words: TERRIFIC and EFFECTIVE.  I tried a three month supply to great success, as the formula quickly slowed, and basically eliminated the problem off too much of much of my hair falling out.  After the supply ran out, I tried a different product that had high reviews and claimed to do the same things -- BIG MISTAKE.  I foolishly tried that &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; product for awhile, hoping it would &amp;#34;kick in&amp;#34;, but it never did.  I am back on this and once again, the improvement was noticeable and rapid.  The mistake of switching off of it will not take place again, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> I have been taking these for about a week now. I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes yet but I am hopeful to give it the full 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;Doubling up with this product may be in the works to obtain faster results. These pills have not caused any dietary issues (stomach pains) so that to me is a plus as I am sensitive to that.</li>
    <li> This product has really helped thicken my hair naturally.  It&#x27;s very safe with zero side effects.  I would recommend it to anyone who is struggling with hair loss or thinning hair.  It&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any less hair loss, or any hair growth after 2 months of taking it. I took it twice a day, as recommended. Maybe I should have continued the treatment longer, but I honestly didn&#x27;t feel like spending another 60 dollars. Anyways, I&#x27;m not upset because I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything. I just don&#x27;t understand how this product has so many good reviews, if it didn&#x27;t do absolutely anything for me. I ended up buying other hair supplements, and although nothing is growing back, there is a considerable less amount of loss.</li>
    <li> Used product faithfully for almost 4 months.  No improvement whatsoever, Waste of money and time taking it everyday.  Will never buy this again.</li>
    <li> Totally a rip off of the real Hairmax Pills but half the ingredients.</li>
    <li> I bought this in addition to &amp;#34;Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx Shampoo&amp;#34;, together they work wonders. This is giving me healthier, thicker and stronger hair. These products are making a huge difference in my life, and people are starting to notice. My regrowth of hair is making me feel more confident, and every day I thank the magicians at Ultrax for doing amazing work! Try this out, and I promise you won&#x27;t regret it. I would recommend to this any guy or gal, looking to combat hair loss.</li>
    <li> The vitamins and herbs in the product has been very helpful and has gotten the results I&#x27;d hoped for. Good product!</li>
    <li> My hair no longer sheds and I have a much fuller head of hair.  My hair is so thick and I could not be more pleased.  To be honest I have never made it a habit of taking vitamins but I do eat healthy and have a lot of fruits and vegetables incorporated in my diet.  It is such a great product that I may cut back to 1 a day instead of the recommended 2.</li>
    <li> I had been using biotin for about a year, and my hair quit responding to it.. I saw this and read the reviews and thought, what the heck! and tried it :) BEST. DECISION. EVER. seriously, my hair has grown another inch. its thicker and seems to even be stronger.. as before using Hair Maxx my hair would break easily when brushing it. I was also losing a lot of hair when brushing, and was worried this would eventually start to make my hair thin. (I know you lose hair everyday naturally, but this was a ton of hair every time I brushed) I will for sure be buying another bottle when I run out!</li>
    <li> I purchased this bottle because my hair is very fine and I lose a lot of it in the shower. Well, I am glad to say that my hair has completely stopped falling out in the shower. My hair has gained great volume and it looks so healthy and glossy. I am so glad finally something works because I know I have taken biotin since I was about 14 and it has been 6 years now and that hasn&#x27;t helped as much as these pills. I would recommend it to anyone suffering from hair loss or just looking to improve the texture and appearance of their hair. (Men or women)</li>
    <li> My hair was thinning and coming out in clumps whenever I brushed or showered it.  After taking this product for a couple of months, I have now noticed that it&#x27;s not happening as frequently and my hair feels thicker and softer.  At least give this product a try and I know you will love it as much as I do!!</li>
    <li> My daughter ordered the Ultrax Labs Hair Rush for me 2 months ago when I decided I wanted to grow my hair back again. I have always cut my hair after my 30&#x27;s like a male hair style and my hair has gotten thin throughout the years. Long story short, we got the product fast and I have been taking Hair Rush ever since. My hair looks like it has life to it! My hair sure did get thicker and I could tell that the strand itself felt stronger. Most likely from all the beneficial minerals that are in the product. I was also pleased to see that this product uses solubilized Keratin, which does wonders for the hair. I recommend Hair Rush for anyone looking to grow a healthy and thick set of Hair!</li>
    <li> One of the best supplements I’ve ever purchased. All the ingredients are completely natural, so I know that I’m putting healthy minerals, vitamins, and herbs in my body and no unneeded chemicals. The capsules are also easy to swallow and leave no after taste or upset stomach problems. After about 3-4 weeks, once the body had gotten use to taking this product, I started seeing real results. My hair has become stronger, thicker, and less hair loss has occurred. I’ve even noticed new hairs growing in. Also, individual hair strands appear to be more resilient and less damaged. Since this supplement also has many added vitamins that the body needs on a daily basis, I’ve also noticed an increase in energy levels and alertness. Since only 2 pills are taken daily, I usually take them at morning and night. The regimen is very easy to follow and is not a hindrance at all. I feel better about myself every day. I’m so happy to have found this amazing supplement and will definitely be purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> I just had a baby a few months ago and about the third month noticed my hair was falling out everywhere! Every room in the house seemed to be victim to my shedding and falling out hair. I realized it was the changing hormones but couldnt help and be saddened and scared at the extensive hair loss. My usually thick hair was not so thin i had to change my rubber bands to ones that could double up and hold the hair better because there was so much less of it! After seeing this product online I purchased it because of the great reviews. Boy am i happy i did. I started using the pills exactly as the instructions said and noticed a HUGE difference in just the first week of taking the pills!! My hair first week was not falling out nearly as much and felt slightly stronger. By week 3 it was back to normal before it started to fall out. I had No more concerns about hair shedding everywhere I went and now i had my head of thick hair back! And an extra little bonus? My nails were growing faster &amp; less splitting than ever ;-) I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who would like to prevent hair loss and gain their hair back.</li>
    <li> I developed chalazion on both of my eyes after one month of usage. The hair growth started accelerating after 3 months of usage.&lt;br /&gt;But I rather have no swollen eyes than more hair.</li>
    <li> Let me tell you why this product is great!!  I have always struggled with hair that is thin and that will break easily. These vitamins have changed that. With just two pills a day my hair is on the road to having gorgeous hair that I can be proud of. I also use Ultrax Labs Caffeine shampoo and conditioner to give my hair even more shine and durability.  I no longer clog my shower drain with hair that falls out. My hair is think and strong. Go ahead and try it. These vitamins are great and you will not be disappointed from the results.</li>
    <li> This product has a great combination of highly active ingredients. I love that it&#x27;s all natural! A very effective product and easy to use, just take along with other supplements and there are no contraindications with other meds. It&#x27;s a sure thing!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!  I have tried other supplements before, and this one really does it.  Keratin, vitamins... totally natural.  It has nettles as a main ingredient too, which I drink as a tea all the time for the health benefits; I had no idea it could work like this!  My hair is noticeably stronger, thicker, fuller and healthier looking.  I am a believer!</li>
    <li> This supplement is by far the best I have tried so far!  Having curly hair, I get pretty bad breakage from products and styling, especially in the summer with the sun beating down on me all day.  This product started working right away, all I can say is bye bye frizzy baby hairs, hello long luscious curls! Great product, I will definitely re-order!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a great difference using this product. I had a hair cut I didn&#x27;t like and it&#x27;s grown out so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d suggest using it in conjunction with a complimentary shampoo.</li>
    <li> This product works so good that every inch of your body hair grows really fast, it&#x27;s kinda annoying. If your in a hurry to grow your hair this is worth the money.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! I use the pills in conjunction with the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge shampoo, and can see the difference in my hair!  It&#x27;s stronger, way less fall out and breakage. And with the shampoo feels thicker than before! Can&#x27;t wait to continue to see the benefits of this amazing hair supplement, whatever they put in this pill is amazing!</li>
    <li> I have used this product over the past year and I have definitely seen hair growth on the top front of my head. I noticed that my hair was thinning so I started researching which product would help speed up the growth of my hair. I would stand behind this product and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a miracle!</li>
    <li> This product was amazing really made my hair grow fast and long. No shedding after use and I got many compliments better than Hairfinity</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product only a month but prior to using it my hair was falling out by the bushel. now that i&#x27;ve started using it, my hair is no longer falling out. I am so impressed with this product that I ordered another 2 bottles. It has no side effects and doesn&#x27;t make your stomach hurt like other similar products with the same claim. This product however does what it says and i&#x27;m glad I found something to make my hair stop falling out. I&#x27;ve also noticed my hair starting to come back. It&#x27;s slight but I can notice it.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle, after about 3 weeks into my first bottle of taking the supplements I stopped losing hair in the shower. It is giving me healthier, stronger and thicker hair! The vitamins in this product are working and my hair hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Ultrax labs hair maxx for a little over 3 weeks now, and I can say with great confidence that my hair is healthier and fuller! Before using the hair maxx product, when I would wash my hair in the shower abnormal amounts of hair would fall out. After using Ultrax labs hair maxx for only 3 short weeks I&#x27;m noticing a tremendous increase in my hair growth and hair falling out is just about 0! This hair growth product is changing my life now that I have a fuller head of hair&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Ultrax Labs Maxx!!</li>
    <li> It has been 1 month that i am using this ...it works great .. less hair fall and can see baby hair budding out .. Which is simply awesome !</li>
    <li> This product works great and I recommend it to anyone with hair loss issues. Results could be seen in as little as a month.</li>
    <li> My hair went through two big sheds last fall and winter.  My usually thick and shiny hair had shed by about 1/3 and I was willing to spend anything to get it back. I was diligent about taking the right dose daily and never noticed much of an improvement which was a disappointment because it&#x27;s not inexpensive.  I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> still using. with some regrowth showing</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs knows what they are doing and my hair growth shows the positive results. The ingredients in this product are known stimulants of hair follicles and the cells responsible for vigorous hair growth. My scalp feels nourished by the ingredients that go into the formula and within a few days the hair on my head is thicker. I am not sure if my grey hairs are due to stress or aging but they seem to have gone away for the most part after using this from as far as what i can see and i attribute that to nutrients on a molecular level. They have formulated a product here that not only left my hair feeling and looking fuller and thicker but it seems as if the ageing process or hair loss caused by stress and the appearance of grey hairs has ceased. I think it is effective and its interesting to me how they figured this out because it works. It expensive but it has been blocking my hair loss and seems to have stopped the grey hairs from coming back on some scientific biological level. Way to go Ultrax Labs !</li>
    <li> I have been using this product and it is amazing. My hair is becoming thicker and I love it. It is also growing in length as well. I used to just take Biotin but this contains Biotin and works much better and faster in my opinion. I currently take it daily and I am going to continue to use this product. I have always had long hair but over the years it started to break and get thinner. Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx put an end to this.</li>
    <li> I have tried all sorts of products for my hair and this one has worked out well. I feel that over time my hair has progressively grown thicker and has fallen out less than before I had my children. The pills are also easy to swallow (which is a task in its own, for me).</li>
    <li> Never worked. ZERO % Difference. Dont buy, its waste of money.</li>
    <li> Some of the one-star reviews of this product suggest that all the five-star reviews of this product must be bogus because it doesn&#x27;t work.  I have no knowledge of the quality of this product, but I do know something about bogus reviews.  I responded to an ad on&lt;br /&gt;Craigslist looking for people to &amp;#34;test and review&amp;#34; products.  I was given a promotional code to buy the product on Amazon and paid $10 to review it with the caveat that I not post anything other than a five-star review.  With the second assignment I was given, I was encouraged (twice) to go ahead and rate the product as soon as I&#x27;d purchased it without waiting until I&#x27;d actually received it, never mind tried.  The third product I was asked to review was Ultrax Labs Hair Rush DHT Blocking Hair Loss Maxx Hair Growth Nutrient Solubilized Keratin Vitamin Supplement and for this assignment I was explicitly instructed to not buy the product at all, to just write the review.  Apparently, $10 is enough to buy most people&#x27;s integrity, but when I read the negative reviews of Ultrax Labs Hair Rush DHT Blocking Hair Loss Maxx Hair Growth Nutrient Solubilized Keratin Vitamin Supplement  from people who&#x27;d been ripped off, I could not do what was being asked of me, which was to outright LIE.</li>
    <li> Wow is all I have to say! It&#x27;s been years since my hair has looked this good. It&#x27;s thicker, shinier and seems to grow a bit faster as well. I also don&#x27;t have clumps of hair laying in the shower anymore.</li>
    <li> After taking the supplements for some time, can feel the difference in my hair being thicker and full of body. In additon to the supplements, I use other hair products with Keratin, helps fight off hair thinning due to having hypothyroidism, no more handfuls of hair when shampooing!  Overall great product!</li>
    <li> Easy to follow plan for hair growth. Hair grew back quickly, no side effects, and works long term. Plenty of supplements per bottle, lasts for a long time, able to stop and continue use depending on hair results. Active ingredients are natural!</li>
    <li> Have been using it for over 3 weeks now. I think the hair is getting fuller and thicker. But no new hair on the bald spots so far. Hair does seem to grow faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way there is nice article in Consumer Reports about the trustworthiness of online reviews which I recommend to read before buying something solely based on star reviews. Also suggest reading this article from Winter 2014 MIT sloan review about &amp;#34;Heard Mentality&amp;#34; when it comes to Online reviews.</li>
    <li> I have debated about purchasing this product for months by reason of the price.  However, when my boyfriend started talking about shaving his head due to his hair falling on his shoulders every day; I immediately thought this would be an excellent chance to share the cost.  So when I asked him if he would like to try this Hair Maxx product----he did not hesitate.  In less than a week after taking the supplements, he told me his hair had stopped falling out.  We were amazed at how quickly this product worked.  As for me, I have noticed that my nails are stronger and longer.  I will have to do a follow-up review for my hair since it hasn&#x27;t even been a week.  Incidentally, my boyfriend has already ordered another bottle; he now wants his own bottle and more importantly for me he has decided not to shave his head.</li>
    <li> I started taking these pills a few months ago when I my wife noticed my hair was starting to thin a little more then it should.  After taking I stopped seeing so much hair left on my pillow every morning.  After a short time my hair even started to look fuller.  I also like that these pills have no scary side effects like some other hair loss medicine.</li>
    <li> Well at first I must say I was a bit skeptical about this product. However at my age, the hair thinking and loosing some when I would comb through in the shower, made me say &amp;#34;what the heck....try it!&amp;#34; Needless to say, I am thrilled with this product! My hair is no longer showing up in my comb in the shower and it feels fuller, thinker and more manageable! Looks like this product is now a part of my daily routine! Maybe in time I will grow more hair. Ice only been on this for a month and I&#x27;m very happy with the results! Thank you!!!!!!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a way to grow your hair fast look no further than Hair Rush DHT. I noticed pretty significant hair growth with just one bottle.</li>
    <li> Kudos, wonderful product !  The results are truly amazing, couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better. after using these I can&#x27;t help but to love my hair.</li>
    <li> This works relatively fast! Had some thinning going on and now my hair is as strong and full as ever. The pills are easy to take and I haven&#x27;t had any negative side effects whatsoever. Def going to keep buying this, might recommend it to LeBron. Go Cavs!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Going to continue to add it to my daily supplements.</li>
    <li> The horseshoe shape of the hairline is a trait that runs in the family... I Stumbled across this product and it has real results. It definitely stops the effects of DHT as it says it will so my hair is growing back in. I&#x27;m so thankful to this product as it has turned my hair situation around. I will keep buying more!</li>
    <li> I have tried the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo product and loved it! My hair has never looked better! With that said, I can only imagine this would be just as effective and the perfect compliment to their other products.</li>
    <li> This supplement works fantastic with Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo, strengthens hair from follicle to tip of the hair. Recommend this to anyone who has thinning or damaged tired hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month, I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s helped hair grow back but it has kept it from falling out so much (I can tell after my showers) I am a big advocate for vitamin supplementation anway, so I believe this is a plus in helping to combat your thinning hair or hair loss challenges. I give it a thumbs up!!</li>
    <li> I always thought that any type of hair regrowth product would not work, but that&#x27;s because I never tried it. This product Did prove me wrong. After a month I knew I had to reorder for more. The change in my hair was progress and I cannot to see another month&#x27;s result!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many hair loss products in the past but so far I&#x27;m impressed with this. I have less hair falling out and my face isn&#x27;t breaking out because of this.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as a gift.  He loves it and calls it a miracle drug.  He has stopped shedding.  This really works.</li>
    <li> I really liked to use these supplements for healthier hair in addition to other healthy hair products. I noticed less fall out and increased hair strength after using the supplements for a month.</li>
    <li> My hair is thicker and even feels healthier!  This product works better than any of the other treatments that I have tried and I have even started to get comments about how great my hair looks since I started to use it.  I also have been noticing a big decrease in hair loss when I take a shower (which is a relief).  My hair feels much thicker and I am very happy with my results.</li>
    <li> My hair feels fuller,stronger and actually longer compared to before I started taking the pills. It&#x27;s easy to take with water before meals and I cant get over the difference I see in my hair!!!!! This is exactly what helps my hair to be healthier everyday!!!</li>
    <li> I buy this for my wife. and I have to say that she has tried other products, but this one does what it says it will do. She had a problem in the past with thinning hair. That has reversed, and we owe it all to this product. The shipping is lightening fast too!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product because unlike all other hair loss vitamins, Ultrax Labs has something special. especially with the added keratin that was the real treat&lt;br /&gt; it allows my hair to always grow faster and thicker!</li>
    <li> I like the ingredients list on this product but I am still waiting for any noticeable results to appear. I will update my review shortly.</li>
    <li> I have been using hair maxx supplements for the past year and my hair is definitely more healthy. It has become thicker and noticeably longer.&lt;br /&gt;I am sure that it affects everyone different but I think you have to take it consecutively for at least months before you see any results. Prior to me using these , my hair was breaking and thinning, mainly due to a certain medication I&#x27;m taking, and I wanted to avoid propecia at all cost. I think hair maxx is one of the best kept secrets for hair care.&lt;br /&gt;I first heard about it in the Mens Fitness magazine.</li>
    <li> After having 3 kids and having a family history of hair loss and shedding and trying numerous products this is the only one that works. In the beginning it slowed downed significantly and now it has stopped my hair feels fuller shinier and healthier than before. I would definitely reccommend this if your tired of wasting money on other products that claim to do the same thing this is the real deal</li>
    <li> I have not used these vitamins yet, but I do have experience with the Ultrax Labs Hair Products. I&#x27;m excited to see if these Vitamins work as well as the Ultrax Labs Shampoo I&#x27;ve been using. I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo for a few weeks and i currently lose LESS hair in the shower than ever before. Which in return is giving me fuller and thicker hair. Coming from this brand, I&#x27;m sure these Vitamins will not let me down.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because of all the great reviews. My hair has noticeably thinned out over the past few years and I thought the product would be worth the cost if it worked. I took it faithfully for two months and saw absolutely no difference. My nails did not become stronger either. I know it says you should try three months, but that would be $180 and after spending $120 and seeing no improvement at all, I decided to give up on it.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the results.  I found no side effects.It&#x27;s made my hair start growing back and as thick now as it was in High School! Wonderful! After all this product is definitely helpful .Really works!</li>
    <li> I started taking this product and I notice that my &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; has reduced drastically.  I lose so much hair every day it is very concerning. I am a woman and I am too young to be losing hair!!!  I notice that it has reduced by at least 1/2.  I am very happy and am extremely optimistic!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you will be happy!</li>
    <li> So far I don&#x27;t see any results. I keep my hair cut short(clipper setting 1), but as it grows out, it thins. I am onto my second bottle and we&#x27;ll see what happens.  i will try three bottles before I call it quits.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It came quick and on time and i never had any issues with shipping. This product did exactly what it claimed to do. I definitely saw results. I would recommend this product to anybody wanting a hair growth product that works.</li>
    <li> I was surprised how well these pills worked.  My hair started thinning and I naturally did not want that to continue any more.  After a little more then a month I started to see results.  My hair was thicker and looked more full.  I am very glad I started taking these Ultra Labs pills.</li>
    <li> This product is simply amazing. It took a while for me to start to notice significant results, about 5 or 6 weeks. Initially I did notice I had a lot less hair gathering around the drain of the shower, so much less was falling out. After a few weeks i noticed my hair becoming much thicker, and fuller, and my hair looks so much more healthy than it has before. Using this with the Ultrax Caffeine Hair Loss Shampoo together has made my hair fuller and more voluminous and fall out less, and I recommend using both together, especially for hair people who suffer from hair loss.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I opened this  product before discussing it&#x27;s use with my primary care provider.  I was advised not to use it because of the fact that it was not evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. As a result because I opened the product I cannot return it,  consequently I have paid $60.00 for something that I cannot use.</li>
    <li> not working ...i used 4 tubes...nothing changed...:( i dont know what i am going to do !!!!! please suggest me something..</li>
    <li> Hair Maxx supplement contains more than 20 essential minerals, vitamins and herbs combined to invigorate hair follicles and spur faster growth.&lt;br /&gt;A key ingredient is keratin, a protein found naturally in hair, skin and nails. The vitamin restores and boosts levels of keratin, which is known to strengthen hair and maintain its elasticity.&lt;br /&gt;Other important components that help make this supplement effective include zinc, B6 and biotin. Biotin supports keratin and is believed to help halt and reverse hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;Another vital ingredient is nettle leaf powder, an herb that promotes hair thickening and sheen as well as controls dandruff. It also has been shown to partially block DHT, which triggers hair follicle deterioration.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle contains 60 capsules, which are to be taken twice daily with meals. A 90-day regimen is recommended.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand how,  but this works. I used it for a month to try it and forgot about it.  Then about 6 weeks into the medication, I noticed I had some stubborn hairs that would not style.  Well that was because they were new hairs that were too short and stubby to bend with the other longer hairs!</li>
    <li> Over the past few years I have noticed an increasing problem with thinning hair.  I see daily proof of this by seeing more and more  hair at the bottom of my tub after each shower. I have only been taking this supplement for a few weeks but have already noticed less hair in the tub after showers and my hair also seems healthier and shinier than before. I have tried some other products in the past and did not notice a significant difference after taking them for a month or two.  I am excited by this early progress and definitely will keep going on Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx and am excited to see the results after a few months!</li>
    <li> I started using this product about a month ago and I&#x27;m so impressed with the results! There is the normal shedding but it is shedding less hair and I noticed my hair is thicker when I ran my hand through it. You can see the softened texture which made my hair looked healthy and vibrant. I recommended Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx to anyone experiencing major hair shedding.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I bought 3 bottles and combined it with the Ultrax Shampoo. Results were underwhelming.  Shedding stopped after about 10 days...then started up again after two weeks or so.  Hair loss is tricky so I won&#x27;t say these reviews are bogus but when I try a product for three months and see zero results...you gotta wonder.</li>
    <li> I purchased the combination of this Hair Loss Hair Growth Nutrient with the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Growth Stimulating Shampoo for thinning hair, and I started out with baby fine hair so one can imagine my need for a solution. This combination in six weeks has done more than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and a lot cheaper than other solutions I thought would work. I highly recommend this combination to anyone suffering the same or similar conditions.</li>
    <li> Hair Maxx is the ideal hair supplementation to go along with hair thickening shampoos. The pills are very easy to take because of their size. You only have to take two pills per day with food which makes it more convenient to many other hair supplementation products that require you to take pills 2-3 times per day. I am still early in the stages of taking this product and can’t wait to see how it changes my hair in a few months.</li>
    <li> All the active ingredients are tested and proven to solve hair loss along with all the extras to help you on your journey. Hair grows thicker and faster than ever just be patient for results! Suggested use is a minimum of 90 days I would recommend sticking by that. Will suggest to friends for use!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend came to me with a concern about him losing more hair and he’s worried that he’s going bald at the temples. He’s kinda freaking out about it actually. I reassured him that we’ll find a solution that works well for him and produces results. I then began to do my research to find solutions to male-pattern baldness. One option is hair transplant surgery, but that was out of the question. It’s just too pricy to entertain that option right now. However, I’d figured we could give a supplement a try since it’s not that much money out of pocket, all things considered. I’m thinking what’s $60 spent if it makes him happy, ya know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So he’s taking it and we could both see a difference. His hair has a glossy sheen to it where before it looked dry, new hairs have come up where his hair was thinning, even his nails don’t chip like they used to. He says he’s hooked on it. He’s happy, so I’m happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I didn’t buy this supplement from Amazon, I’m writing a review because I want the company to do well. Why? Well, I figure if it does well they’ll keep making this supplement for us to buy and my boyfriend seems to be in love with this product, so there you have it. They have to keep making this stuff! Please -- for my sanity and for his don’t discontinue this supplement!!</li>
    <li> Hi!  This product has helped my hair grow and become thicker!  It works great for anyone who wants their hair to grow more and grow thicker!  Please try it out as you will love the results!  :-)</li>
    <li> Ive been using this product for about 3 1/2 weeks now and I can honestly say that I am seeing hair growth improvement  faster than I thought, I started using this in the beginning of the month and its almost the end of the month and like I said Im definetely seeing hair growth improvement and I will be ordering me another bottle..I already recommended this product to a few family and friends of mine about &amp;#34;Ultra Lab Hair Maxx&amp;#34; and  please remember you have to have patience its not going to start showing results the next day lol but honestly this is a great for hair loss!</li>
    <li> This product has vitamins which exceed 20 herbs and minerals that offer your hair a support from the back to front. It is focused around solubilized Keratin, which alone has been indicated to quicken hair development, expand hair thickness and help diminish balding. Most balding supplements simply take a biotin supplement and include one or two fixings.  DHT is an enemy of hiar follicle on your head  Blocker that helps combat boosts hair loss. Solubilized Keratin protein that occurs in outer layer of skin.  Basic structural component of harir nails, skin substance.  Rich in sulfur containing aminio acids, especially cysteine.  Also changes in DHT metabolism can lead to hair loss.  This does alot more than just &#x27;Biotin&#x27; vitamin supplements by itself</li>
    <li> I love this product. I started using it a few months ago. My hair was shedding and I noticed I was rapidly losing hair at the crown. Today my hair is stronger, and has grown all over and even my nails are growing and stronger as well. I am especially pleased with the growth in the crown area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair stylist indicated that my hair looks healthy, and told me, whatever you&#x27;re are doing keep doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;am 45 yrs old, I color and perm my hair. Soooo glad I found Hair Maxx it works Amazingly. Just take 2 each day!</li>
    <li> Hey !! Seeing results from this product !!  Will tell my girlfriends !!</li>
    <li> As a person with thin hair, this is the first dietary product that I&#x27;m going to try to improve my hair condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it at the price of $59.99 and it has 60 tablets which enough for you to go through a month with it if you take 2 tablets daily.&lt;br /&gt;For only at that price, I would be able to have a thicker and stronger hair which is totally worth your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beauty comes with a price :)</li>
    <li> This is a very good product, hoping to see the results soon. I&#x27;m sure it does all it says it will. I am using it now, I will repost after I see results. I&#x27;m very excited about this product.</li>
    <li> I hate writing reviews but found it necessary to inform the public about this product.&lt;br /&gt;Does the product work -  Yes.  I noticed improvement within a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the bad news - Shortly after I began using this product, I noticed that my toe nails began to change colors until after months of use, my toe nails turned black and HARD!&lt;br /&gt;2. Shortly after noticing the change of color in my toe nails, I noticed the right side of my bottom lip began to darken as well.  It never dawned on me that the two were somehow connected until I took the time to really think about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I put the two incidents together, I checked the fine print of the bottle which states &amp;#34;the product and it&#x27;s claims have not been approved by the FDA&amp;#34;........WELL THAT&#x27;S JUST GREAT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I stopped using the product immediately.  I would venture to say, since this product is digested, it should not be sold to the public until approved by the FDA.  Someone may develop much more serious side effects than those that I experienced!!!</li>
    <li> The Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx is what I been looking for to get my hair to stop shedding. I like the fact that this has vitamins, minerals and herbs that will help my hair stop shedding and look healthier. The big plus is there are no side effects.</li>
    <li> this product is very expansive, and the result is very bad almost zero. I do not recommend this good at all.</li>
    <li> Great product.My sister was experiencing hair loss and bought this product and it worked wonders.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of taking pills by any means, however, I&#x27;ve used this product for over 2 months and have reason to keep taking them. Not only has this product done wonders for my hair, but also has seemed to benefit my skin and nails. My hair has grown in thicker, and healthier over the course of only 2 months, especially around the edges of my scalp where my hair WAS thinning. It has also helped to almost eliminate the heavy shedding I was experiencing using hair regrowth shampoos alone. Overall this product gets more than 5 stars in my book.</li>
    <li> Bought and tried, does nothing. Save your money and buy regular vitamins.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t treated my hair the best over the past two years with all the bleaching so I have been working to fix the damage and strengthen my hair over the past few months. I bought another product from the company and with all the great reviews in addition to the usage of Keratin I&#x27;m very optimistic about my results.</li>
    <li> I’ve been suffering hair loss since two years ago and I’m afraid of going bald. This product helped prevent any more hair falling out of my scalp within the two months that I started using it.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product that actually works! I was somewhat hesitant to try it out at first, but after testing out the product, I am extremely impressed. If you&#x27;re currently combatting hair loss, I highly recommend Hair Maxx!</li>
    <li> I have been using Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx formula for a few months now, and I am very impressed with the results.  I have a long family history of thinning hair and hair loss.  When I started to notice that my own hair was falling out and becoming noticeably thinner, I researched many products hoping to combat this problem.  This product lives up to its claims.  The product helps block DHT, which is one of the leading causes of hair loss.  Most products currently on the market do not do that.  After one month of use I noticed less shedding and had stronger, healthier hair.  This product works by first slowing down the hair loss, then stimulating new hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product contains quality ingredients such as essential vitamins, minerals, and herbs.  It is easy to take and is gentle on your stomach.  You may notice the added benefit of your skin and nails looking better also as a result of using this product.  The product works if you take it as directed and stick with it.</li>
    <li> Works great. Healthier, stronger, more body hair.</li>
    <li> its really a good product. you can see the differences fast. Im gonna buy more and i recommended to any one want to buy a good vitamins for his hair</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I can tell my hair is much thicker when I&#x27;m combing it. I also noticed less shedded hair on my pillow and shower floor. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to prevent hair loss and those who want to thicken their hair in their current thinned or thinning areas.</li>
    <li> I have used and been very pleased with Ultrax Labs, shampoo and conditioner and therefore decided to try Hair Maxx.  The vitamins and supplements contained in the product have been acclaimed by scientists and testing labs as safe and effective, so there should be no concern of side effects that can occur with some hair growth products.  The tablets are small and easy to swallow, and Keratin, one of the main ingredients is, according to Wikipedia,  the key structural ingredient of hair and nails.  It is too early to tell if Hair Maxx will work effectively in my case, but I plan to use it for at least the time suggested by the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Nowadays, there are so many products available that promise results. It&#x27;s hard to find one that actually delivers. When trying these products, you are essentially a guinea pig so it&#x27;s important to know exactly what you&#x27;re putting in your body. With this product, you can rest assured that it&#x27;s all natureal stuff that is just super concentrated. For instance,  some of the ingredients include Nettle Leaf Powder and Pumpkin Seed Powder.  Kudos to UltraX  Labs for keeping it natural!</li>
    <li> I am giving this product 1 star because I noticed the same issue as other customers who caught Ultrax leaving positive feedback for their own product from other accounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually purchased this product once, several months ago. I took the whole bottle to see if there is any difference in my hair thickness, and I didn&#x27;t notice anything. I actually purchased this product because of the good reviews on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought another bottle, and will be returning it ASAP, after seeing that this seller is leaving 5 star reviews for the vitamins and the shampoo at the same time. I know some people want to buy vitamins in combination with the shampoo, but I went through 3 pages of reviews, and there is definitely something fishy with this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yea, and vitamins didn&#x27;t do anything. I can go to my local vitamin store, and by the same formula (plus DHT blocker), or even a DHT blocking supplement for $9-14. This is a rip off, please do your research.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read a few of the negative reviews accusing the positive ones of being paid for. I really wish I was a paid reviewer because this product is pretty expensive. However, after a month of using it, my hair definitely has more body to it and all the trouble spots that were clearly going bald have filled in because of it. I must say I wasn&#x27;t full blown bald, just starting to notice much thinner hair and receding spots. I still haven&#x27;t noticed any new growth but the hair overall looks much fuller so it gives the appearance that new hair has grown. I&#x27;ll definitely update when I&#x27;ve hit the 90 day mark. I&#x27;m not going to say this will do wonders for everyone but it certainly has done a lot in the short time I&#x27;ve used it and my confidence is way up. Even my barber noticed a change, which to me is a great test. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth trying a bottle or two if you&#x27;re having doubts.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good product. Ive used it before and have had better looking and feeling hair because of it. I find it pricy, but it has all the important ingrediants that other products have only a few of. So its one pill shopping. Its also benifited my nails ASO a bonus.</li>
    <li> I like how my hair looks and the progress that its made.  Anyone that has issues with hair loss has got to give it a try!  I will definitely buy some more of it.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and in quality packaging. The supplements are as described by the seller and the bottle contained the proper amount of tablets. And they DO NOT have a &#x27;funky&#x27; smell like some supplements! Excited to get started!</li>
    <li> I waited to review this product until I finished the bottle. Now that I have finished my first supply, I just ordered a second. This product is really worth the price. I had super long, dark black shiny hair. My hair almost touched my elbows. I had a hair cut, from a new stylist about 2 years ago. He 5 inches off my hair, when I had no split ends, and I told him I wanted a light trim. I was really just going to maintain shape. Even though he didn&#x27;t pay attention while cutting my hair ( he was literally talking to the receptionist the whole time) I didn&#x27;t make a big deal about it, figured my hair would grow back. Well, I ended up going through a very stressful period, and I have always been prone to autoimmune disorders. The stress of my life, literally caused my hair to thin, and to not grow. The length that I did had was getting damaged, not growing, I was getting split ends. I am only 29 years old- this was a huge annoyance to me, because has the stress of my life increased, my hair length did not.&lt;br /&gt;Since I have been battling an autoimmune disorder, I have been on a exessive amount of vitamins, for a while. I eat, extremely healthy, but still NO hair growth. Very frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;I bought these a month ago, not really expecting much or anything from the product. ( I am become very accustomed to products not working, so I never have high hopes in any thing I purchase)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, amazed me. My hair has literally grown about 2.5 inches. In one month. Normally, when my hair was growing normally in the past, I would see about an inch growth, per month ( in the summer) and about a half inch growth per month ( in the winter) I was definately not expecting my hair to grow as much as it did. Literally about 2.5 inches.&lt;br /&gt;i have always had very fine hair, and since its so fine it&#x27;s prone to breakage, but I have noticed that I am not removing hair balls from my brushes anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another benefit of this product, is that my nails have always been horrible. They are always brittle ( always have been). My cuticles, unfortunately are the only part of my body that likes to grow at a rapid speed, so I am always having to push them back, remove them, and give my self mini manicures. However, with this product, my nails, are long and strong?!?! For me, that blows my mind, because I have never seen my nails long and strong, unless I had tips on.  I didn&#x27;t even know this product would help with nails, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I am writing such a detailed review on this product, is because it deserves it. I mean, normally if I saw a product for 60 bucks, my pessimistic attitude (because of the failure of a million other products) would of caused me to pass by this. Luckily, I didn&#x27;t. I am just saying, definitely give this a try, because for me, it worked wonders. I&#x27;m very grateful I found it.</li>
    <li> After hearing about this product from a friend (who has had very visible results after 4 months), I decided to give it a whirl due to my hair thinning out on the sides.&lt;br /&gt;After a bottle, I&#x27;ve had noticeably faster hair and nail growth, with even seeing some fullness coming in on the sides, so I&#x27;ve ordered another and will continue to track my progress.</li>
    <li> Just like the Ultrax Labs hair surge caffeine shampoo, the Ultrax Labs hair rush growth nutrient works in the same fashion. If you want assistance re-growing thinning hair, this product is for you. This hair growth nutrient contains vitamins, minerals, and herbs all working to make your hair healthy and stronger than ever. By the way, this product also helps your nails grow strong. Ultrax Labs continues to make excellent, attention-worthy products.</li>
    <li> I have had problems with thin, falling out hair and have tried many products to help but had no luck till this one. Ultrax labs is amazing and has really worked on my hair growing more and not falling out anymore. I stopped using it and I could tell the difference right away. This product has really been amazing for my hair and also adds shine as well.</li>
    <li> I use this product regularly. And all I can say is that it works. My hair used to fall out in handfuls every time I showered, and now my hair doesn&#x27;t fall out at all. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product for anybody suffering from thinning hair or hair loss. I love the ease of just taking a couple capsules a day, and it fits easily into my schedule. It takes out the tediousness of using a hands-on product, and it provides great results! I&#x27;ve been using the product for several weeks and I can already see a definite improvement in the fullness of my hair.</li>
    <li> I have to say, this stuff really works. I have only been using it for 2 months, but already I have seen more growth and less breakage than I have ever had. At first, I was really doubtful as to whether or not this stuff would actually work for me, however, I&#x27;m extremely glad I tried it. This product is definitely well worth the buy.</li>
    <li> this is just amazing! it!! it worked amazing on my father. he has suffered from hair lost for over 10 years now!! he was scared to try something new but after the first month he was over joyed with the results. he continues to use Ultrax Labs Hair MAxx and plans to keep on using it!!! you really get your moneys worth with this!!!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for products to increase hair growth and thickness, I would highly recommend trying this product. You will see an increase in new growth and less breakage soon after you begin using.</li>
    <li> Took 2x/day for 90 days and noticed no difference. I feel like I wasted $180.</li>
    <li> Completed the entire bolete but didn&#x27;t see any change my nails were still weak and my hair didn&#x27;t shoe any signs of growth</li>
    <li> I have noticed my hair is thicker, even my granddaughter said so. My eyelashes are thicker and darker and I had a couple of &amp;#34;cloudy&amp;#34; toe nails that have cleared up also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll get straight to the point. Get this if you are losing your hair, or want to regrow hair. I have been using it for several days now, and I have seen a remarkable halt in hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before when I brushed my hair, there would be clumps left on my brush. Now, there are only a few strands! Shedding has also decreased to nearly a halt as well. There is also a noticeable increase in hair volume too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I recommend that you get this if you want to stop hair loss, or if you want to naturally regrow hair. It&#x27;s also made in the USA, so supporting this product supports local jobs too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend that you not take vitamins though, because this product is basically a vitamin tablet designed to grow hair back. I say this to prevent overtaking vitamins and causing health complications. But again, this product already contains vitamins, so there&#x27;s no need to take more.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!!! I&#x27;ve tried different techniques to prevent my hair from falling out and I&#x27;ve finally found something that works! I saw a definite improvement and I have already recommended it to friends who&#x27;ve experienced the same problems.</li>
    <li> This extra-strength Keratin supplement, infused with 23 varieties of vitamins, minerals, and herbs, is a remedy for hair loss like no other.  It works quickly and effectively.  I was going through a depressing period of hair breakage and loss, but since my use of HairRush, my shafts feel smooth and strong.  My hair does not break like before and is growing thicker.  My fingernails as well are stronger.  Five stars for this one.</li>
    <li> Wow this product is absolutely amazing! I have always struggled with thin hair and hair loss. After using this product for just one month the results were phenomenal! My hair is more full and I no longer brush out tons of hair. After trying several different products I was beginning to give up. This is a miracle product and I would recommend this product to anyone struggling with hair loss!</li>
    <li> I bought one bottle of this product from ultrax lab web store before. I didn’t see any difference after that bottle. I come to Amazon to buy more but only find all of this seller’s reviews are so fake. The reviews for this seller’s  Eye bloom cream and Hair Thickening serum formula are so apparently fake. If you look at the hair thickening serum, it is listed literally without a product image and description, but it has nine raving reviews already. If you take a close look at the reviews of this product, you will come to the same conclusion as the other reviewer said: Most of reviewers are either without any reviewing history, or without Amazon verified purchase, or giving raving 5 star reviews for all of the products of this seller, which should have had raised a red flag for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really pissed off by what this seller has done. It will be foolish for me to believe this product works and continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> Cant believe what this had done for my hair  wow my hair has been growing stronger and fuller. This shine is a plus. was not expecting big results for my shedding dull hair, but now whalla</li>
    <li> This product is effective and works as advertised.  It has been about 2 months since I started taking this and my hair has stopped falling out and new hair has started to grow.  I really wish I would have started using this sooner so I could have avoided wasting money on products that don&#x27;t work.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product. I started to notice some improvements in my hair. Now, my hair is visibly thicker. Another thing that I noticed is that my hair is growing a little bit more. I am very happy about that since a bad hair cut left my hair shorter than I wanted it to be. Also, the ingredients are good quality. In addition to the hair benefits of this product, I am getting more vitamins in by taking this product. Another great thing is that I have not had any side effects from this product. Overall, I am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Hurry up and buy it, seriously noticed improvements in just 1 week! My hair was limp and thinning up front and noticed when combining this with pura d&#x27;or shampoo gold label, HUGE difference in thickness, volume and shine. Don&#x27;t take my word for it, try it for yourself and thank your hair later!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works but all I know is it does. This product really helped my hair growth and thickness. Great product!</li>
    <li> This was worth the money. It is fast acting and the results are so rewarding. I have very damaged hair from my past actions of constant perms, dying and straightening my hair. I thought my hair would never even out or stop looking brittle, but these little tablets helped a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also relieved that none of the ingredients used to make this supplement were harmful, so I wouldn&#x27;t be risking my health to try them out. I am not a pill taker by habit, but once I heard that I felt a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just take them with breakfast and dinner and you will be amazed!</li>
    <li> Try Minoxidil that has at least been clinically proven or some other prescribed treatment. Way better results for me there. There&#x27;s no way all of these reviews are real, either. Very, incredibly highly suspicious of this product.</li>
    <li> Just ordered 3rd bottle, saw noticable results after 2 months. Love it.</li>
    <li> i suffer from really thin hair and i hate it! thankfully i found these pills which have helped me with my problem. I have noticed that my hair is thicker now and I&#x27;m not losing as much hair as i was before. i am very happy with my purchase but I have started recommending it to my friends and family who suffer from the same hair loss issues I have to look into this product. I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> These supplements are wonderful! They have made my hair AND nails much healthier and stronger. They are easy to take because they are small. NO horse pills here! I take a lot of supplements, but now I don&#x27;t have to take as many now because this formula contains lots of vitamins, minerals, proteins, AND herbal extracts all in one! I am really a fan of this company...I use several of their products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing research into hair regrowth lately, due to a thinning crown and decided to give HairMaxx a try. The first thing I did was review the ingredients and was pleasantly surprised to find many of them in my normal vitamin supplement. It is essentially a vitamin with this ingredient called solubilized Keratin which works to increase hair growth and thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gets my five stars because the package was delivered very quickly and discretely. From what I&#x27;ve seen it is the most natural way to go about hair regrowth (no spraying of harsh chemicals on your head). And the fact that the bottle comes with two forms of sealed wrapping so you know it hasn&#x27;t been tampered with during its shipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pills themselves are about the size of a dime and are tasteless.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be reviewing this product at the end of the 90 date bottle with hopefully a few more hairs on my head. Best of luck.</li>
    <li> I received Hair Maxx and began taking it immediately. Within 2 weeks, I began to notice that less and less of my hair was falling out in the shower, and when I combed it. After one month of taking two tablets a day, my hair seemed thicker and more manageable than when I started taking it. 3 months into it now and I could not be happier. The drain full of hair after every one of my showers is gone and I have even noticed some regrowth. I am very happy with this product</li>
    <li> Hair Maxx is the best product I have ever tried. My hair is fuller, and silky, it just feels healthy. This is the only product that delivers on all claims, my husband was the first to notice and now he wants to take it. Once I started taking it, we noticed faster growth and much stronger hair. I color my hair frequently and noticed the colors are much more vibrant, what a great benefit. People are starting to notice and are asking questions. Hair Maxx has done wonders for my self esteem, the compliments are just an added bonus. This product works!!!</li>
    <li> I have been taking this supplement for a while, and i can say that they really work, my hair is thicker and longer and definitely it has stopped falling out, good product.</li>
    <li> Good product to get that hair growing and strong again.</li>
    <li> I feel this product lives up to it&#x27;s claims. My hair is fuller now and has stopped shedding. Prior to using this, my hair was thinning and falling out but since I started taking it, i&#x27;ve seen a vast improvement in not only the appearance of my hair but the thickness and texture. It&#x27;s no longer fine and thinning. I am really glad I found this product and I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> The Ultrax Labs Hair Rush is absolutely amazing. I have been having a really bad time with my hair due to the thinness and shedding, but after using this product for a couple of weeks I see a vast difference. I have not been shedding nearly as much and before using the pills my hair was never as full as now. I honestly love this product. When I brush my hair, I get a good feeling. Thanks to the Ultrax Lab Hair Rush my hair is beyond healthy and even my hair color looks more vibrant. I recommend buying this product if you want to see more hair growth and all in all want a healthier head of hair. 😀</li>
    <li> So far Hair Maxx has given me the results I was hoping for.  My hair shedding (when brushing, combing, and washing) has noticeably reduced.  Also, my hair is thicker and I am sure I&#x27;ve had a little more new hair growth than usual.  Most importantly (in my opinion at least) my hair looks, and feels, healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this supplement to friends who are trying to increase hair growth, improve overall hair health and/or decrease hair loss.  As long as I continue to see results I plan to use (and recommend) Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx.</li>
    <li> If you want to enhance your hair growth and thickening... This supplement will help. Along with the other products in this same line… you’ll get fewer split ends, less hair loss and thickness and possibly more shine! I&#x27;ve noticed that results can vary from person to person,but combined with the shampoo, conditioner and leave in…  you can get amazing results in weeks. More manageable hair that looks and feels healthier. definitely products that are well worth the price and time. Don&#x27;t know of any other product where you can see the results fast. Works well just using one product alone, but amazing using all of them in combination with each other. In my opinion that makes the company who makes it... great.</li>
    <li> hello everyoneim 35 years old and I was very upset about losing my hair in massive amount  and on my way to be bold lol I used a lot of supplements and minoxidil , I bought this product and this is my 3rd day  no more hair fallout I don&#x27;t know if it works for everyone its what you can find out . I am happy with it and wish everyone happy 4th of July .</li>
    <li> It had been too long a time trying other products that just were not able to enhance my hair growth and thickening. I came across this supplement after a friend recommended it to me and it has done wonders! Way fewer split ends, less hair loss and an all around thickness to my hair!! I&#x27;ve also noticed way more shine! The results are noticeable after only a few weeks, I was so impressed. I used to see my hair all over the bathroom and even on my pillow, but now that is just a memory! Also, the pills are small and very easy to swallow. An all-around incredible product.</li>
    <li> This product has over 20 essential vitamins, minerals and herbs and Keratin. Anything with Keratin is going to do really good for your hair (unless you over use it). Same with Biotin products (which this contains also). Best of all it contains Saw Palmetto, which blocks the enzyme that changes testosterone into DHT. DHT is considered a major cause for both male and female pattern baldness, so its important to take pills that help block it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve Taken this product once before and had pretty good results. Better than any other anti hair loss supplement. It&#x27;s a nice feeling to brush my hair and see about half the amount of hair getting caught in the brush than before i started taking this supplement. If you want to Slow the balding process than this product is for you.</li>
    <li> Love this product. The few days I have used the product, I have seen major difference, in my hair thickness, growth, and less to no breakage. In addition, the appearance and texture of my hair has improved as well. This product is so worth it, definitely ordering again to continue giving my hair the vitamins and nourishment needed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks and have seen a noticeable difference. My hair is thicker and fuller and no more waking up with hairs on my pillow. I recommend this to anyone wanting to curb hair loss at its beginning stage.</li>
    <li> I have used numerous products to prevent my hair loss. However, there is no other tablet on the market that provides supplements that block hair loss like this one!!! I love this product!! Total keeper!!</li>
    <li> Was a bit skeptic about this product at first, after reading the legitimate labels I started using it. The supplement seems to be safe, I didn’t get any side effects from it. The hair, overall, is fuller and thicker. I certainly recommend this product. Even though it is something you take in, but it works much better than most products out there.</li>
    <li> I really Love Hair Maxx I started seeing Hair Growth After the First Bottle.. I have finished my second bottle and my hair is much fuller. I have locks and love to pull my hair up in all types of styles, this has caused my hair to come out on the sides almost clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But since I have been using this product I have been seeing major changes in the fullness and quality of my locks. My HAIR Has GROWN ALOT! I am sure after my third bottle it will be all back.. I also see a better quality and firmness in my skin! Hair Maxx is all around a GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED THE HAIR MAXX AFTER READING ALL THE AWESOME REVIEWS AND EVEN THOUGH IT IS PRICEY IF IT WORKS I WILL GLADLY PAY $100 A BOTTLE. MY HAIR HAS BEEN GRADUALLY THINNING FOR A FEW YEARS NOW AND THOUGH ITS STILL THERE I WAS HOPING TO DO SOME PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE. MY GOAL IS TO THICKEN MY HAIR AS I SAID IM NOT BALDING YET BUT IT IS PRETTY THIN WHERE MY HAIRLINE IS.  I PURCHASED THE SHAMPOO FROM THE SAME COMPANY AS WELL AND WHILE I DONT SEE ANY DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENTS YET THEY DO RECOMEND TO TAKE FOR AT LEAST 3 MONTHS AO I WILL SAVE MY JUDGMENT UNTIL THEN. IM PRAYING THIS WORKS</li>
    <li> Absolutely no change after 2 months</li>
    <li> It was around week three when I stopped shedding hairs into my shower drain. But since then, my hair has been nothing short of glossy, full and luscious. I feel more confident more than ever after two bottles purchased with more on the way. Based on a good friend&#x27;s recommendation and the doctor&#x27;s &amp;#34;orders&amp;#34;; I decided to do a bit of my own research. Hesitant to try something I had little experience or knowledge with, coupled with the insecurity of even admitting out loud that I needed a solution to a problem I thought I wouldn&#x27;t have for many more years, I was met with the best of possible outcomes. I am so happy that I was able to find this product and am a big fan of its results. If you&#x27;re worried, don&#x27;t be. It works, period.</li>
    <li> Scam. Tested the product for claimed ingredients and it fell WAY short. Lots of fake reviews.</li>
    <li> My family has history of hair loss so i decided to give Hair Maxx a try. AND IT WORKS!! i am in my 1st month and yes! you can see the results. It is amazing how this medication really works. i am 26 years old and i can see that im not shedding hair anymore. and slowly tell that my hair is stronger and im not afraid of losing it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Ultra Labs Hair Maxx has given my hair BACK! thank you!&lt;br /&gt;1st its not that expensive for the kind of results you get!&lt;br /&gt;The seller has great reviews on it and a very good reputation. on time delivery and great Results. Just as they advertise.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product 100%</li>
    <li> I am impressed by the difference this product has made in my hair. I was noticing a lot of hair on my pillow in the mornings and serious thinning over the past couple of months. I decided I needed to take action and try something before it got any worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some research and ordered this product based on the incredible amount of positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been taking Ultrax supplements for about a month now and I am SOOOO happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultrax has not only helped with my hair loss, but I&#x27;ve also noticed my hair/nails feel thicker and stronger as a result of taking the supplement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works and I would recommend to anyone battling hair loss.</li>
    <li> My husband was losing his hair and was a little insecure about it so I bought him the Ultraz Lab Hair Maxx and it worked great. All the ingredients that are in it cause no harm and the worst thing that would happen would be nothing at all! We had nothing to lose and after a few weeks his hair started to grow back and the hair that was already on this head was thicker too! I would recommend this product to anyone that could be losing their hair or if their hair is thinning! This product works wonders!</li>
    <li> Great product so far. My family has a history of not so much hair so I&#x27;ve been trying out a few things and this one works great. No complaints whatsoever, it simply works and at a very fair price. I love the fact that it promotes hair growth while decreasing hair loss while increasing hair growth and thickness.</li>
    <li> The Hair Maxx contains solubilized Keratin and other essential vitamins. It is easy to reach your desired results just by taking 2 tablets total everyday during meals. This extra strength formula really works! My hair recovery process was faster than anticipated and I was very pleased with the results. If you want longer, thicker hair, then this formula is perfect for you. The essential vitamins aid in circulation and increase hair growth in a safe and effective manner. No matter your gender or age, this formula is perfect for anyone looking to improve the quality of their hair or increase the growth of their hair. Definitely worth the buy!</li>
    <li> I tried this product as instructed by the label for 6 months and it did not stop my hair gradual hair loss.  I wish there was some magic cure for male pattern baldness but this is def not it.</li>
    <li> This product is a great way to get your hair growing. Highly recommend to anyone with hair loss. I would highly reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because I was losing my hair more than usual, probably due to the low carb diet I am on.  I decided to try this to maybe close the gap on any nutritional/vitamin deficiencies that may be the cause of my brush and drain being full of loose hair.  After about a week of use, I have noticed much less shedding.  I take two tablets each day and it seems to be doing the trick!</li>
    <li> I already purchased the caffeine shampoo for regrowing hair from this company, but I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to combine a topical solution like that with a daily supplement. One thing that really appealed to me about these is that unlike Rogaine or Propecia, they&#x27;re natural supplements that weren&#x27;t put together in some chemical lab. I tend to shy away from unnecessary prescriptions--particularly because they often have pretty disturbing side effects. For instance, Propecia is widely suspected to cause sexual dysfunction in men...so while it may bring you back some hair, it won&#x27;t do you much good in the long run! These supplements are essentially a special combination of vitamins and Keratin geared to give your hair the best chance to succeed, so you don&#x27;t have to fear unwanted side effects accompanying your new look. It&#x27;s definitely not necessary to use them in combination with the shampoo, but I&#x27;m quite happy with both purchases.</li>
    <li> I have been taking Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx for 2 months and have not noticed one ounce of difference.  I question why it is so expensive and am doubting the accuracy of the positive reviews posted here. The discrepency between 5 stars and my experience is puzzling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to return the pills but obviously...I can&#x27;t.  Seems like a gimick..</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that these vitamins are the best on the market hands down!  They are easy to swallow and does not give an after taste in your mouth. You are going to see results VERY fast. It doesn&#x27;t matter if its thinning hair issues or just wanting longer fuller hair they will work! I will definitely keep taking these vitamins until I reach my desired hair length. I got so many benefits from these vitamins including thicker fuller hair. Lastly, they will also help with your skin and nails. Unlike other vitamins on the market they will NOT cause you to breakout and prevents shedding. I noticed results very quickly in my hair growth length and also a glow in my skin. Just follow the directions on taking these vitamins and drink your recommended amount of water DAILY! ( thats the most important part )...And you&#x27;re going to love the results!</li>
    <li> I had been taking the supplements in this product separately for some time and have found success.  The hair maxx pills just combine everything into one much more convenient product.  In addition to helping with hair loss some of the ingredients are beneficial in helping to build muscle (saw palmetto) and better brain function (ginkgo biloba).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it&#x27;s a great product that not only prevent hair loss, help in new growth but also has other health benefits.  It&#x27;s a little pricy (so is buying the herbs separately though), but IMO well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle now but I can tell its definitely working hair is not falling out like before and my hair feels thicker too I&#x27;m very happy with this product. I&#x27;m not sure but after the third bottle ur hair should start to grow again if it doesn&#x27;t well at least the hair loss stopped and that&#x27;s better than nothing right? But it should grow back! also makes ur nails grow mad fast too I cut them one day and in 2 days they r long again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been using this supplement for about nine months after noticing that my hair line started to recede a little. It took a long time to notice because my hair is always short (to the skin most of the time for military regs), but a friend recommended I try some stuff from Ultrax labs. At that time I wasn&#x27;t ready for much, so I started ordering these from their website and found it really convenient to take with my vitamins daily. The thing that I saw most with my hair line was that it would leave a few stray hairs just beyond my hair line when it recedes, and that seemed to stop after about thirty days of taking it, so I kept it up. When I saw their shampoo on amazon, I ordered it, and its been working great too. I couldn&#x27;t help but use my amazon prime to take advantage of a little faster shipping on this though as I have a tendency to wait until the last minute to order it. All around a great supplement to have, I&#x27;ve also noticed that my nails are a lot stronger and have been healing a lot better after an accident than they previously had, so I am all around satisfied.</li>
    <li> This product really works!!! I was introduced to Ultra Labs from a former co-worker who was suffering from female-pattern baldness and since I had gone through chemo treatments I was losing my hair at an alarming rate to say the least! After about three months of continued use, my hair stopped falling out and the new hairs that were coming in were thicker in texture. To anyone who is on the fence about this...don&#x27;t be, give this a shot!</li>
    <li> Wow I have never seen so many fake reviews in my life</li>
    <li> Totally easy way of getting beautiful healthy hair! You just need to take 2 tablets every day with food. This extra strength formula actually works!! The process was faster than anticipated and I am so pleased with how my hair looks now after years of thinning! So glad I found this on Amazon for a cheaper price :)&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a major skeptic of products like this for my whole life but when my hair started thinning I started trying everything and this is one of the few products that made a real difference to me! Within just a few weeks of use I noticed much less hair in the drain and my scalp was noticeably more populated. Not only was there more hair, but it seems much stronger and with fewer split ends then before. All in all I would strongly recommend this product to anyone going through hair loss. Your hair is a valuable thing and if you can spend a bit of money to hold on to it then go ahead, what are you waiting for?!</li>
    <li> I have always had fine hair and wanted thicker, fuller hair. I have researched what kinds of vitamins or products to use, but have never really found anything specifically for hair growth or thickness. This product is great because is geared for hair stimulation, growth, and protein, and is not filled with different chemicals I&#x27;ve never heard of. I like the natural minerals and vitamins in this product including Keratin which I have always used in my shampoos which offer temporary thickness. I will definitely keep using this product and see what kind of lasting results I get.</li>
    <li> For the past three years, I have tried a wide variety of hair loss products that have made lots of promises but delivered meager results. After two months of using this natural supplement, I am feeling that my campaign to stop my hair loss may finally be on the right track. I first noticed fewer hairs in my comb and brush and on my pillow after about ten days.The fact that this Ultrax Labs supplement uses all-natural ingredients and is made right here in America gives me more confidence than the exotic  off-shore products that I have tried in the past. Thus far I am very pleased and would rate the supplement with five stars..</li>
    <li> Brought this for my mom a few months ago, I wish I had checked around further it&#x27;s cheaper here lol. Anyway I brought this for my mom and she swears by it. Her nails are very long and her hair is starting to look thicker.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic.  After just 3 weeks into my first bottle of taking the supplements, I noticed less hair in the bottom of the shower. My hair feels healthy and much stronger.  The vitamins in here sure have helped me. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The best DHT blocker in industry! It not only blocks the enzyme for thinning hair/baldness it grows thicker more beautiful hair.</li>
    <li> This supplement contains a solubilizable version of keratin. The keratin is essential for the  body to regrow skin surfaces as well as hair. The fact that it contains all essential vitamins is even better because it has synergistic effects with the keratin so it allows hair to grow back quicker while increasing the thickness of the hairs. When the body undergoes dht changes, it will impact hair growth. By having the added benefit of of blocking dht it will stop hair loss and aids in the hair growth process. All in all this is a great combination supplement that yields great results for hair growth!</li>
    <li> My hair is stronger and fuller in such a short time.  I have less hair in my comb.  I&#x27;m surprised by how healthy it looks and how fast it is growing.  Healthy hair growth finally.  The vitamins seem to be helping my skin look great too.</li>
    <li> Having just bought the Ultrax-Labs shampoo and finding it such a successful product so far, I went ahead and bought this supplement as well and cannot believe how different the quality of my hair is after using the combination of these two products. In just a few short weeks, my hair loss has noticeably decreased (almost by 75% of what it used to be) and the volume has almost doubled. I am so happy with this product and would definitely recommend it to anyone having rapid hair loss!</li>
    <li> I have tried a few other products like biotin shampoo and vitamin b supplements but couldn&#x27;t really notice any difference with my hair. I decided I should try this because I wanted fuller, thicker hair. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would make much difference or, if I would have to wait for months to see results. This is my second bottle of the stuff and I have to admit it actually works. I first noticed my nails getting stronger and then less hair on my pillow. The really great thing is that I don&#x27;t stress out about hair loss anymore and I think that also helps maintain a full head of hair and gives me better confidence too!</li>
    <li> Consistently used for 3 months with no results.  I compared monthly pictures across 3 months; also asked others to guess which were after 3 months of use.  No one could tell which was the most recent picture.</li>
    <li> Ok guys, here is my experience. I am 65 years old. I have had baby fine hair my entire life. Now it is also thinning out even more. I figured that&#x27;s just the way it&#x27;s going to be at my age. I used this product the first time several months ago. It takes a little while because your hair has to grow out a bit but I began running my hand through my hair and noticed a different feel than I ever remembered. My hair is thicker and fuller than it has ever been as far back as I can remember. I absolutely recommend Hair Max to anyone who would like to turn back the ages and be proud of their younger looking hair.</li>
    <li> I was so impressed with the shampoo I decided to do some research into the pills. After reading all the wonderful reviews I was intrigued.  The first few weeks I didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference. Then I went on vacation and left them home and THATS when I noticed it. It was working but the change was so slow I hadn&#x27;t noticed. As soon as I returned home I started taking them IMMEDIATELY!! Now my hair has a lot less breakage and is softer, shinier, and much more manageable.</li>
    <li> I tried a lot of DHT blockers. This one rocks. it stopped my hair falling within a week. I judge that by watching how much is falling when I ma brushing after after washing hair and drying it. because it is expensive I am only taking once a day. it is so effective my body hair is growing. that is a problem.lol .I  hatehody hair. In my case when ever i take vitamin E,omega-3 supplements it increase hair fall right away. So i avoid those including any male enhancememnt supplements.  I wish thery produce equally effective shampoo so I dont have to take these pills and grow hair all over</li>
    <li> Really works.........Just dont stop taking or else it will stop working.</li>
    <li> Ever since I was diagnosed with Lupus I have been loosing my thick hair.  I have tried all kinds of vitamins and products trying to get my hair to stop thinning out.  I found Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx DHT Blocking Hair Loss supplements and my search is finally done.  This works amazing!  My hair is finally growing and becoming thicker again. I have received lots of compliments, people asking what I am doing differently.  It makes me feel good for people to notice the change.  I would recommend this product to anyone! I have ordered extra to make sure I do not run out anytime soon!  I will be a lifetime buyer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought 100&#x27;s of products on Amazon, but this is the first product I am writing a review on. Hairloss had become integral part of my life. I stopped caring eventually because nothing would help. Diet, hair oils, shampoos..nothing would work. One of my friends told me about this product, said it was working pretty good for them. I thought twice about spending 60 bucks on it, but then got it eventually. Just 4 days after I started using this product, hair fall reduced by 80%! It&#x27;s certainly a miracle!! I don&#x27;t see any baby hairs coming up, but I&#x27;m happy with the stopping of hair loss as of now. If I notice new hair growing up, i will revisit the review.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of all the great reviews but am not convinced as of yet.  I have been on it for a month.  It is very expensive so if it doesn&#x27;t work I will not be purchasing this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 3rd week and I can say my skin is radiant and my hair is fuller, still loosing hair but not as much. Also, I feel more energetic , I wonder if it also helps your mood and energy?&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone feel better taking it?</li>
    <li> Very good product....starts out slow but once it starts working. WOW! I have so much new growth coming in it is crazy.  Must have!</li>
    <li> These pills from Ultrax Labs are magic in a bottle will definitely be ordering some more as this is exactly what I was looking for and needed greatly recommend these</li>
    <li> UPDATE AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS. i don&#x27;t see any more improvements. My hair grew but then it stopped so i really don&#x27;t see the point on continuing to take this. i won&#x27;t be buying anymore</li>
    <li> I was really impressed on how quick it worked, I figured it would have taken months to work or even notice anything. But they started working in about 3 or 4 weeks. These pills are great!</li>
    <li> The time Hair Maxx was advertised, I was so skeptical to try it. Here I am trying to minimize my receding hair lines. I&#x27;ve been taking this supplement for months now. My second purchase since then. I noticed baby hairs sprouting after a month taking though I still suffer from slight hair loss. \\&quot;Placebo effect?\\&quot;  Maybe or maybe not.... Mine is a case of Male Pattern Baldness. Sign of aging?  I guess because of the receding hairline. But what&#x27;s good is that the hair fall was significantly minimized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although remedies promising to restore hair to balding heads have been around since ancient times, proper care of one&#x27;s self is also the best remedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many varied conditions we experience hair loss or baldness. In others, they looked at it as a disease that should be given a prompt solution. Others choose to only deal with the criticism of other people and deal with the shame.  We can&#x27;t avoid if it is inherited, but we could still minimize the effect by:  Primarily, enjoying more time relaxing. It is important to enjoy and avoid those things that just bring stress and negativity. Life is exciting that trying to focus on you balding or receding hair lines.  Try to mingle with friends, recreate, reinvent yourself, explore and find ways to make yourself happy. Are you sick causing your hair falls? Consult a doctor to prevent and have a treatment. Wherever possible avoid vices such as alcohol and cigarettes, start exercising and eating enough food at the right time.  Avoid eating junk foods.  Start eating fruits and vegetables rich in vitamins and foods with protein. Unhealthy hair maybe is also sign of malnourishment.  And most of all, getting the right supplement such as Hair Maxx with Biotin and other essential nutrients for a healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Maybe effective&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Quite expensive but what is $60 if it is effective?</li>
    <li> After incorporating Hair Maxx into my daily regimen for a few weeks, I&#x27;m happy to already notice such a difference!  I&#x27;m really glad I gave this supplement a shot because not just myself, but also my friends and family have noticed a difference in the state of my hair.  The texture feels smoother and overall appears more thick, shiny, and healthy.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone struggling from hair thinning and loss.</li>
    <li> I have been taking this product for a few weeks now. I&#x27;m almost out of my bottle and I will be ordering another months supply!!! I suffer from hair loss and my hair has been thinning out for years. I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference in the health of my hair. I use to lose a lot of hair during the day, while combing and in the shower. Since taking this product, I haven&#x27;t even needed to clean out my hair brush or unclog my shower drain! I&#x27;ve also noticed my hair has been feeling a lot stronger so if you suffer from breakage and hair loss then you should give this product a try!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by a close friend. At first I was somewhat skeptical because some online products are just about profit. But this is a really good product to use for any adult wanting to grow hair. I wanted to use the supplement to have fuller hair. I didn&#x27;t have issues with crazy side affects like sweats and excessive facial hair. It took about a half a bottle before I started to notice small results, but trust me you don&#x27;t want to miss out on thus great product!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product. I have been looking for a good product to help my hair growth and strength. This is it! I first noticed that I shed less hair when I brush, so I know that my hair is getting stronger and not breaking off as easily. It also seems to be thicker and healthier. I&#x27;ll be suggesting this to my husband as well!</li>
    <li> I got these pills because my fine hair had completely lost its shine and luster and seemed to be thinning out. After only a few days I could already tell a difference. Now my hair looks just like when I was younger, with more volume and a natural shininess. I totally love it and have gotten more Ultax Labs Hair Maxx pills for my twin brother, who has been losing his hair (it&#x27;s hereditary for all males in our family). It seems to be working for him, too, as his leftover hair seems thicker and he even noticed some new growth in the bald areas. Not sure if it will all grow back, but at least it&#x27;s an improvement. If you are not happy with your hair, you should definitely give these pills a try as there is nothing harmful in them at all. My hair looks better than ever before and I am so glad I found this stuff. It&#x27;s amazing what a huge impact healthy looking hair has on your self-esteem and appearance.</li>
    <li> I have been using these pills for about 2 weeks now and I can already see slight improvement.  I know that it will take longer to see full results, but I wanted to share my results thus far.  If I&amp;#34;m already seeing result, I&#x27;m confident they will continue to work and I will see if more strength and less loss of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my 2 pregnancies, my hair hasn&#x27;t been the same. It is much thinner and falls out by the handful!  I have tired everything to get my thick and healthy hair back, and Ultra Labs Hair Maxx Supplements are the answer. Just in these last 2 weeks, I am not loosing nearly as much hair (nearly no lose at all) and I can feel my hair is stronger already!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would completely recommend this product to anyone that is experience any kind of hair loss, thinning of your hair, or even just less strength! Worth the money!</li>
    <li> I have purchased other Ultra Labs Hair products and I cannot say enough how amazing they are. First of all, I received my vitamin supplements so fast. They were also packaged without any problems. This company has great service. After taking these hair growth pills I have already noticed the difference. I am so happy with the results so far and am excited to see my hair become fuller and thicker. My shedding has also decreased tremendously. Others have also said something to me about how my hair looks healthier. I am so glad I found these hair loss vitamin supplements and will without a doubt continue to purchase them. Overall I would highly recommend this product to anyone! The five star reviews were right- these are a life changer!</li>
    <li> Less hair in my shower drain and hairbrush and more on my head, this product is amazing! Love that it is made in the USA too.</li>
    <li> I have tried every hair regrowth product under the sun from shampoos to prescription spiro and had not seen any results.I started using Hair Maxx at the end of February-Since I have started my hair has grown at least 4 inches!&lt;br /&gt;My nails have always been very thin and brittle, now they are growing long and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;As far as regrowth, I check my hair every other week and I  see small hairs growing from my roots (which weren&#x27;t there  before).I have been struggling with hair loss for the past 3 years  now and I am only 24 years old so it has been a major  headache and has impacted my confidence greatly.I have had every test done and all of my labs come back fine...Since taking hair maxx and noticing regrowth I am slowly but surely regaining my confidence. I will continue taking this product for as long as its made.I have had no side effects what so ever and its being an all natural pill is a big plus for me!It does take some time so keep with taking 2 pills everyday  even if you don&#x27;t see any changes, it will come! Every time I purchase this product it is at my door within 2 days! And as a plus these are very easy to swallow and don&#x27;t have a nasty aftertaste.</li>
    <li> The bottle says it may take up to 90 days to see results so be patient. It took me well into my 2nd bottle of the product to actually &amp;#34;see&amp;#34; results enough to make me a believer. But my MPB crown is substantially smaller than it was before I began taking Hair Maxx. It is so easy and refreshing not having to rub in any creams or ill-smelling liquids anymore. Take a pill...BE PATIENT...and watch for the very positive results. But it...try it...stick with it!!!!</li>
    <li> From user named Diana on Amazon.com:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;... I did inform Amazon, that a PR company paid me to write a review on this particular product that I haven&#x27;t tried, so Amazon will get to the bottom of this. I am sorry if anyone bought this product based on my review I cancelled my order for this product, so I won&#x27;t have any idea of the authentic results.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comment was found as an answer to one of the questions asked for this product. You can find it at the following URL:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Does-this-work-hair-loss/forum/Fx2S6HHBXTK0G70/Tx25L7I9250VIFI/1/ref&#x3D;cm_cd_ql_tlc_al?_encoding&#x3D;UTF8&amp;asin&#x3D;B00BFFQMBA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her review about the product can be found at the following URL: http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1D1LCHXVNJW1P/ref&#x3D;cm_cd_qa_customer_linkpdp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the comment is real, it seems that the user DID NOT try the product, so, it MIGHT work after all. I read many of the 5 star reviews given to Hair Maxx, and indeed, many of them seem to be paid reviews. Whether the product works or not, the paid reviews sure would make the product price much higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course we can&#x27;t know or prove if the comment is real or not. Please make your own judgment. For now, I will try finding another alternative for my hair loss.</li>
    <li> My hair was noticeably bigger when I took the product called HairMax. is there anybody else out there that is noticing hair loss and thinning since they changed the name? I have not changed anything in my life except I still take this product and it is named something else now, and my hair has been falling out since a month or so after they changed the name.  I am hoping to hear if anyone else is experiencing the same thing as I am. This product used to be the one thing I suggested to everybody to help their hair. Now I&#x27;m not so sure. They must have changed the formula. I certainly, and continue taking the product.</li>
    <li> In March of 2012 when I had to deal with the life-threatening illness of a relative, I noticed that my hair fell out in patches, and for some time it would not grow back. I tried Rogaine, but no result (or I just wasn&#x27;t patient enough). All summer of 2013 I noticed that I was shedding hair rather quickly. After doing some research, last month I decided to try the Hair Maxx, as I now have a better understanding about the effects of DHT, stress and its effects on the body. So far I have noticed that I am not shedding as much, which is good. My nails are indeed much stronger. As far as new growth, well, it&#x27;s still early to tell. I&#x27;ll be finishing my first bottle this week. I&#x27;ll get me another bottle and see. Hopefully by Christmas I should be able to give some positive news about those weak spots and patches where the hair fell out. I like the fact that the tablets are easy to swallow, and there are no side effects or aftertaste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking the blocking hair growth hair vitamins for almost 2 months now, i&#x27;m pretty happy with my results. I&#x27;m still waiting for the hair growth again but is for real stop my hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m ready to buy my 3rd bottle supply, people say that my hair looks much better, that feels good, because the vitamins are doing their job.I am very happy with these vitamins, and I totally recommend them if your main goal is to stop hair loss.</li>
    <li> I have used many hair regroth medications but with this one I have seen the most results from, the other haven&#x27;t worked this well. Most like due to the dht blocker this formula makes use of to great success. I will order more when I run out thanks ultras labs for a good product.</li>
    <li> This was such a disappointment.  After reading all of the 5 star reviews I had high hopes and bought two months worth of pills at this ridiculous price!  They did absolutely nothing.  NOTHING.  It is hard to believe that so many reviews are fake...maybe it just did not work on me.  Anyway, just going to use the hair supplements from the vitamin section of the pharmacy.  A lot cheaper and certainly could not be any less effective.</li>
    <li> Saw no difference with use.</li>
    <li> Love it! Hair Maxx has helped my thin hair to become fuller (my nails too). I take two a day as recommended, I know it is pricy but you get what you pay for, results. If you only take one pill it might take longer to see results. No amount of money is worth it if it doesn&#x27;t work but if it does then $2 bucks a day is worth it (hair loss or thin hair is embarrassing). The ingredients in the supplement make sense if you research the properties of them as I did. The pills are normal in size and tasteless. Made is the USA is also a benefit.</li>
    <li> This stuff is works like magic.  I have always had a thin hair, and in the last few years it had become even thinner and also brittle due to color treatments and heat styling. Since using Hair Maxx, my hair is fuller, shiner, and looks and feels thicker than ever.  I am so pleased. I would recommend it to anyone with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Patience is definitely part of the hair growth process, but it pays to be patient and after my first bottle I definitely saw growth and strength in not just my hair but even my nails. I shed less and notice stronger roots and more volume in my hair. I really like that these supplements have several different vitamins, not just biotin but B6, Zinc, Magnesium, Vitamin A and ingredients like Saw Palmetto which from what I have read can help block DHT. The fact that it has DHT blockers was what convinced me to try  these supplements in the first place, and I&#x27;m glad I did! Losing your hair is not easy to deal with, but taking Hair Maxx has really helped my confidence and is truly one of the best products out there.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product for people who want healthier thicker hair! I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes when I first started using it! I recommend this to anyone wanting better quality hair. 5 stars for sure!</li>
    <li> I have been taking Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx DHT Blacking Hair Loss Growth Nutrient for 3 months and I&#x27;ve noticed my hair grows SO much faster. I&#x27;ve had it trimmed twice already and my stylist is shocked at how fast it&#x27;s growing!  I have been dealing with hair shedding/thinning due to hormonal changes and it hasn&#x27;t helped with that, but it does make the new hair that&#x27;s coming in grow much faster. Within one month I could feel my hair texture change. It&#x27;s much stronger and thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 3 months now I feel it&#x27;s pretty much the same - less hair loss and still thicker and stronger. I have been using less products to make my hair look better (volume, shine, etc), so that&#x27;s nice too! I do feel like my hair gets oiler quicker (but that could also be the hot summer weather too!). I&#x27;m going to take it for the six months, like they suggest. So hopefully I will see more improvement by the end.</li>
    <li> I give this product 4 stars, because less than a month my nails are stronger and longer; I have to cut them more often. I don&#x27;t know yet about my hair,  I have it braided since I started using this product. as soon as I take  the braid out, and see the result; I will change it. All I can say, this is a good product no side effect, easy to swallow; I take two every morning with breakfast</li>
    <li> Best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used. This product has completely changed my life, its given me back my confidence, self esteem, and the ability to look in the mirror again and actually enjoy seeing the person looking back at me. This is now the only product that I allow to touch my hair now. The results I&#x27;ve experience are nothing short of miraculous, I recommend this to anyone that wants healthier hair without the worry of ineffectiveness. Ultrax has really outdone themselves with Hair Maxx. Thank you for giving me back the happiness that hair loss had taken from me. Buying this product is an investment in your happiness. A must have.</li>
    <li> This product is what ive been looking for!&lt;br /&gt;It works as expected, my hair has been suffering&lt;br /&gt; from hair loss&lt;br /&gt;Thats why  ive decided to look for Kind of treatments&lt;br /&gt;Others dont work for me but this one did the trick&lt;br /&gt;Ive noticed less shedding, thicker hair on back&lt;br /&gt;Made my hair shiny aswell&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I had purchased two bottles of this product before there was a price change. I am now on my second bottle and can say there is some increase in hair growth as noted by my hairdresser. As far as the hair loss there has only been a subtle decrease in that, as I am still losing hair when I shampoo, but I am happy to report when styling less hair is noted left in  my wide tooth comb to untangle my hair. I am sure this product will in time product the desired results one is looking for, however for me it&#x27;s a bit to pricey, therefore I gave it only 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Hair Maxx by Ultra Labs is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for to get my hair to stop shedding. I like the fact that the ingredients are  natural. It has vitamins, minerals and herbs that will help my hair stop shedding and look healthier. The big plus is I only have to take two tablets a day with food, there are no side effects and it&#x27;s made in the USA!</li>
    <li> Excellent product it has over 20 essential vitamins, minerals and herbs to give your hair a boost from the inside out. It made my hair feel relaxed and not so heavy or dried out.</li>
    <li> Having ordered the Ultrax Labs shampoo and getting great results, I decided to add the Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx vitamins into my routine to see if I could achieve even greater results, and I was not disappointed! My hair has stopped shedding, and feels so soft and healthy. My hair feels thicker and stronger, and I highly recommend trying this product if you experience thinning hair like I did before trying this product. Just a great brand in my opinion and from my own personal experience.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. After about 3 weeks of using it, I noticed that my hair was not falling out in the shower or collecting in my brush. I also noticed new growth at my hairline and crown. The hair on the top of my head had gotten finer than the rest of my hair and limp, but the product restored my overall texture! I couldn&#x27;t be more happy.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this product quite a while ago with her account and I started using it. All I have to say is that it helps a lot and I don&#x27;t regret spending the money. I spend all kinds of money on hair products and this one seemed to just help with hair loss even more.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product ,  because I needed my hair strengthen for one so I took time to see if I noticed any changes with my hair and I absolutely did ! Usually when I wash my hair a bunch of it is dangling from the comb but after taking theses pills I saw little to none after I washes my hair so i was happy to see the results</li>
    <li> I have been using hair loss shampoo and supplements. You will see results within a week by using  Ultrax lab products. These  keratin supplements are great. If you want thicker hair with less hair loss, these are perfect for you! Ultrax Labs Hair Rush is highly effective for both men and women, and there are no side effects. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with baldness or thinning hair.</li>
    <li> This is the second ultrax product I have gotten. First I got the shampoo because sense I had my son 15 months ago I have been loosing my hair in handfuls. I can never wear my hair down because I feel like I&#x27;m a animal shedding. Finally I am feeling comfortable to start putting my hair down. The pills are helping that much more. I plan on getting many more ultrax products.</li>
    <li> I tried this on a whim. As far as actually doing anything for hair growth, hard to say. Probably nothing, or nothing more than a $15 bottle of hair vitamins from a pharmacy would do. I do know that this gave me SEVERE headaches that lasted for over a day. This product is a scam and possibly dangerous.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for hair. After taking this, my hair looks much healthier and nice plus I also start stop losing my hair. This is complete stuff for hair growth and make them more beautiful !!</li>
    <li> Sorry, I spent money on 3 bottles of this stuff and never noticed anything. I&#x27;ve stopped using it for a month now, and again nothing happened indicating it didn&#x27;t grow any hair at all.</li>
    <li> It has keratin, it has biotin, and it has a lot of whatever makes your hair grow back. After just a few weeks, you can see the great effects all the vitamins are having on my hair. Its has made my hair thicker, stronger. The shedding has drastically reduced. Amazing product. Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Shipped very quickly! I couldnt be more happy. It was efficient and great :)</li>
    <li> Noticeably thicker and fuller hair in just a few weeks. The wife loves my thick mane. I feel like a lion!! I would highly suggest this...it is a little on the pricey side but it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx Vitamins!  I have tried several of their products and all of them work great.  These vitamins really helped me as my hair has been falling out at a rapid rate this year. I can tell a HUGE difference and have been taking them for three weeks straight.  My hair no longer falls out in clumps in the shower and it feels stronger!  I take the vitamins twice a day with food and they do not upset my stomach.  I can see baby hairs growing in and it looks fuller already. The vitamins contain Keratin and Biotin which helps so much with growing thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend you to try these.  They are so worth the investment!  I will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with these tablets. I&#x27;ve been taking them for a month or so and I have really noticed my hair loss come to a stop. My hair was always shedding I would see so much hair on my hair brush from just a couple of strokes. I&#x27;ve always been nervous about trying any type of hair pills because of the side effects you hear about but with these I have not seen any side effects what so ever. These are really effective and you will notice the change in your hair I am so happy that I came across these! My hair is becoming a lot healthier and stronger and I cannot wait to see my hair months from now, I know it will be fuller than ever.</li>
    <li> My hair is growing back.</li>
    <li> These supplements really work! Within just a short amount of time of using it, I saw drastic improvement and would definitely purchase again. I have recommended this to friends with the same problem and it has also worked for them. I am definitely re-ordering before my first bottle runs out !!! Thank you Ultrax Labs!!!</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic! I almost can&#x27;t put it into words! I have very thin hair and I started using this just to try another product. I didn&#x27;t think it was working, but once I stopped using it I noticed a change. I will continue to use this because I haven&#x27;t found a product that works better!</li>
    <li> I am blown away by how quickly I have seen actual results from hair hairmaxx! I have been taking it for a couple of months and I am seeing major hair growth. The most significant growth I have seen is at the crown of my head where it desperately needed it. Also the keratin has made my hair much more soft and less frizzy, it&#x27;s a win-win.</li>
    <li> Even if you are skeptical about hair loss products I would encourage you to try this one. I like the fact that this supplement is a pill, so i know that it is working from the inside out unlike topical treatments. It contains solubilized keratin which means it digestible unlike most vitamin supplements on the market. Good hair loss supplement if you are beginning to see signs of thinning.</li>
    <li> Just decided to try this because of a good reviews and so purchased this few weeks ago for $39 and now the price goes up..i noticed new baby hair coming out on my scalp which is good for only 2 weeks of using it i also taking biotin and saw palmento with this and i think it makes more powerfull. but for the price right now its a big No for me..  i dont think i&#x27;m still gonna continue using this one..it is not affordable for people like me and i think the price like that is only for rich people hehe..just got my prescription for proscar 5mg(finasteride) 30 tablets is only $9 at wallmart and i have to cut 1 tablet into 4 and just take 1.25% of it i think will save me a lot of money and i think will also get a positive result..</li>
    <li> My hair has been thinning for about 6th months now and I need to try and reverse this process. I tried both the Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx pills and Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine shampoo and I have noticed a difference in the short 3 weeks of using this product. I recommend using the two items simultaneously</li>
    <li> did not do anything at all for my hair.</li>
    <li> I have been taking Hair Maxx and also using a shampoo for thinning hair to try and repair what stress, aging, and maybe genes have done on my fine hair that was once quite thick.  It&#x27;s not so fun to go back to the same hairdresser you&#x27;ve had for years for a routine haircut and then have her comment that your hair is not as thick as she remembers.  Ugh.  I have been taking Hair Maxx for a few weeks and feel like there are less strands coming out on my hairbrush in the morning.  It does say for best results, take the tablets for a minimum of 90 days and I am only a few weeks out.  The B vitamins in it seem to be giving me a bit more energy during the day now too.</li>
    <li> This product is great my hair was thinning from a pregnancy and a few weeks after taking this product my hair stopped falling out. It also became thicker after a few weeks and much healthier looks. Would recommend this product to anyone with thinning hair!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It helped my hair look fuller and feel thicker in under a week. After just a few days of use, I could see the results! My hair was shinier and thicker and had more volume than before. It looked incredible and healthy and I, personally, felt even more incredible! This product is definitely worth the buy as it will make your hair grow and prevent loss and ultimately make it look amazing with thickness and fullness!</li>
    <li> This vitamin seems to be well worth the money paid. I have noticed new hair growth as well as my current hair seems thicker. Easy to take supplements make it an easy way to stop hair loss.</li>
    <li> I used this treatment as directed and also washed my scalp with cold water and a chili shampoo. Therefore my shower drain hasn&#x27;t got clogged with my hair. I am a happy hairy guy and hope you do so as well. Its worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Finally, something to help my shedding problem that actually works.  I also bought the shampoo and it seems to be working.  I will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> My baby was born 6 mths ago and like most moms,i experienced a lot of hair loss postpartum, a lot!!it got soo bad that my scalp was beginning to show in between hair strands.my lowered immune system due to 18 yrs type 1 diabetes didnt help the situation either. However,thanks to my hubby who found this product my hair loss has gone down dramatically.if i see 3 strands of hair during a wash i see plenty.my hair has body, my curls are back and i dont see my scalp.im on my second bottle and i think im going to take this all the time!!give it a try what will you lose......hopefully no more hair!!</li>
    <li> I seriously think all of these posts are lies, and are paid workers that are trying to increase the rating of this useless product. I&#x27;m sorry, but this product has done absolutely nothing for me and I have been using it for quite some time. No loss in hair loss, no increased hair growth, no increase in hair thickness.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m experienced confidence issues from hair loss and thinning hair. I&#x27;m 30 and I look like I&#x27;m balding. This isn&#x27;t attractive and I&#x27;m not ready to shave my head. I tried everything and then I tried Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx. This was the right choice. My thin hair became fuller and grew quicker. It&#x27;s a great product and I&#x27;ve regained my confidence. I recommend Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx if you want fuller, thicker hair.</li>
    <li> My friend gave me a bottle of this a months ago and I have been using it ever since. There has been a visible difference to the look of my hair and I can feel the increased volume which prevents my hair from looking worn out. This product had significantly reduced the amount of hair I lose while showering and combing. It is definitely worth the price, so I have just ordered another bottle from amazon</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who feels their hair is on the thin and limp side. After 2 weeks I really started noticing a difference! My hair began feeling thicker and stronger. I was also using this product in unison with Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo, but trust me it&#x27;s sooo worth it!!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this. My hair fell out after about 1 week!!! It is a rip-off. Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this combined with Ultrax&#x27;s Growth Stimulating Shampoo for a couple months now and have seen some amazing results. This product has stopped my hair loss in its tracks and has noticeably made my hair thicker. I have also noticed that I have many new baby hairs growing in and overall my hair just feels so much healthier! Also, with the Keratin in these pills I observed that my nails have been much healthier as well. You definitely get what you pay for with this product!</li>
    <li> My family has a history of thinning hair and I wanted to be proactive about it when I first started to notice it happening to me.  After about 3 weeks I noticed less hair in the shower drain.  I am really happy with this product.  It has been completely worth it for me.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  It worked really well and very quickly.  I was amazed at the new growth and thickness of the new growth of hair.  I would recommend this product to anyone suffering with any type of hair loss even a partial loss.  On my mother&#x27;s side we tend to loss hair in spots when we are stressed.  This product works really well for just those paticular areas that needed hair.</li>
    <li> If you suffer from hair loss that&#x27;s definitely your answer. I bought it recently and used it and now I can see a major difference between my hair now and before. Someone told me about the product and I decided to try it. Now I am glad I did. It made my hair stronger, It doesn&#x27;t fall out anymore, and I can see that more hair started growing. Isn&#x27;t it amazing? 100% satisfaction indeed</li>
    <li> I like the ingredients of this product. It really is nourishment for hair.&lt;br /&gt;Because my hair is extremely fine &amp; short, my hair actually looks and feels thick.&lt;br /&gt;Lol...it feels good NOT being able to see between every hair on my head..</li>
    <li> I used this with the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo and I  found it to be a great combination for regaining my hair!  The shampoo actually produces new hair in bald spots that hair had fallen out long ago, and the supplements help give your hair the necessary nutrients it need in order to repopulate itself.  It&#x27;s a great combination that really works which I would highly recommend to anyone wishing to get a full head of hair back.  Try it you&#x27;ll find out that it really works!</li>
    <li> Hair Rush is an amazing product that actually works to increase the thickness of your hair and the production of new hair growth for both men and women. This is a natural supplement that works by blocking the production of DHT, which is responsible for hair loss. It contains over 23 vitamins some of the most important ones being solubilized keratin which accelerates hair growth, nettle leaf powder to block DHT, and other follicle boosting ingredients such as biotin and vitamin b6.&lt;br /&gt;There is no magical way to grow hair overnight but this supplement when taken twice daily has proven effective in making your hair healthy and strong all the while boosting the production of new hair in areas where there is some baldness or thinning.</li>
    <li> I had problems with my hair, so I needed to try something different. I decided to try the Ultrax Labs Rush DHT. I think my decision was very good with using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, I started with trying to enhance my hair growth and thickening. This product is a natural enhancer and effective use of a supplement to get results.&lt;br /&gt;So, I have fewer split ends, less hair loss and over all thickness of my hair, which I love very much. Moreover,  I&#x27;ve noticed more shine and sheen in terms of my body and health of hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, in terms of what you get the pills are not as big as most dietary supplements&lt;br /&gt;so they are easy to swallow. The results became noticeable after a few weeks of taking, combined with the shampoo I am thoroughly and very much impressed.  Overall, my hair is now so much stronger and longer I&#x27;ve never been more satisfied!</li>
    <li> This right here is possibly the best product I have ordered! Very amazing and works in no time. I recommend this to everybody thats reading this! It is no joke people, it will help you out!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the Ultrax labs Hair Surge Shampoo and it worked great, so I thought, &amp;#34;why not try this product with it?&amp;#34; After only two weeks of using Hair Maxx, my hair was almost twice as thick as it was before using the shampoo or the nutrient; I was stunned. I also really like that Hair Maxx helps my hair grow faster too, because I have a lot of NEW HAIRS starting to sprout where my receding hairline use to be and in spots where my hair was thinning.&lt;br /&gt;Already several of my girl and guy friends have asked me if I was doing something different with my hair and remarked that it looks thicker. My confidence has skyrocketed and I feel 10 years younger! haha, Ultrax Labs, keep it up!&lt;br /&gt; And to think, I almost paid out the nose for hair plugs!</li>
    <li> Finally I found something to stop my hair from falling out! It really works!</li>
    <li> I attribute this product (along with Biotin) has helped my hair. I swear that I don&#x27;t see gray as soon as I used to.  I used to get my hair colored every 4 weeks.  Now I&#x27;m going to the beauty shop every 6 weeks and I truly could go 7 weeks, but by that time I need my hair trimmed anyway.  I also notice that I&#x27;m not loosing as much hair in the shower as I used to.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> after a week that I started this product I stop losing my hair and after a month was longer as well, I Will recommend this product to averybody because it worked on my,</li>
    <li> So lets just say that dreams really do come true! I had a really hard time coming to terms with the fact that my hairline was diminishing slowly but after using Ultrax Labs Hair Rush DHT I am 100 percent convinced that all of my hair line loss&lt;br /&gt;will be restored. After just 3 weeks of using this product I see results. My hairline is no longer falling out and I feel more confident wearing my hair in a ponytail. I feel great about my hair restoration!</li>
    <li> Hair loss runs in my family, and now that I am getting older I have noticed my hair is dramatically thinner than it used to be. I started to get worried I might begin to lose it if I didn&#x27;t do something about it. I&#x27;m not a fan of taking pills of any kind, but when I read that the ingredients were vitamins like A, C, D, E, B12, Niacin, Biotin, Magnesium, Zinc, and many others I felt safe enough to try this. I have been using this for a couple months now and I have to say it really helps. My hair is thicker, and fuller and I&#x27;m not self conscious about my hair anymore. It&#x27;s also gotten about an inch longer as well! I would definitely recommend Hair Maxx.</li>
    <li> Great product! The only way you will know is if you tried it.</li>
    <li> This product has really made a difference... My hair loss and the thinning has stopped! I will definitely purchase more...</li>
    <li> I work in a call center and I wear a headset all day every day. I my hair has been falling out and thinning wear the head set sits all the time. My boss thought I was crazy for buying it, said nothing was wrong, but I could see it thinning. So I bought this, and my bald spot has thickened. My hair also has gotten very shinny, and super thick! I love the product. They for me are easy to swallow with water. Take two a day and thats it. I love my hair and the red has never looked better!!</li>
    <li> I love this when used in tandem with Nixon shampoo and conditioner.  I find that together they encourage plenty of hair growth.  Also new research shows that vitamin D is important in this.  Hair Rush and Nioxin both block DHT - one from within and one from without.  I also make sure I eat right.  I am 47 and my hair is finally growing back in after 3 years of awful hair loss that gave me a really wide part and I had to wrap my hair band about 5 times over a ponytail.  Now I wrap it 3 times around.  You cannot skip a day on the supplement and once you see growth, you cannot stop (that is what my experience has been at least).  I shampoo and condition about every 3 days which for some people might be tough.  but I love the product.  I have no idea why they changed the name.  It&#x27;s the same company, same looking label.  I will look into that.  But it is cheaper than other things on the market and with my regimen, it definitely works.</li>
    <li> Many (most?) of the 5 star reviews lack a &amp;#34;verified purchase&amp;#34; label..... hmmmm..... that seems odd to me. If hair loss could be cured with a pill, wouldn&#x27;t that be big news beyond Amazon.com?</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a product that will decrease hair loss and thicken and lengthen your hair, this is it! When brushing my hair, it doesn&#x27;t seem to fall out as much, also the hair strands themselves appear to be thicker and not so fine. I&#x27;ve used it for about a month, and saw results within 2-1/2 to 3 weeks. I have some sensitives to some supplements and this one did not irritate my stomach at all! If you&#x27;re looking to decrease breakage and hair loss I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really unsure if it helped or not but my hair do3s feel a little  thicker.</li>
    <li> I really like this supplement. In addition to healthier looking hair, my finger nails are stronger and I have more energy. This is a great addition to my daily hair care routine starting from the inside out. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who is searching to restore and/or gain healthier hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product. Everything arrived as described, hair loss appeared to lessen around the second week. Hair growth seems steady and I am extremely happy with these results. Over all a great product that I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I love, love the Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx.I am 38 years old and noticed my hair was thinning pretty fast too. I decided to buy Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx and after a few weeks I noticed the difference. You can definitely see the stubs growing I am so excited to see the end result. I am such a believer that I ordered a bottle for my sister. It also leaves your hair looking healthier and shinier. I would definitely say if you are curious you should try it, it worked for me..I would highly recommend to others.</li>
    <li> this stuff is a perfect supplement to have; it helps strengthen and fortify hair. Taking a chance, I purchased this supplement myself, and I can say: NO REGRETS. If your balding, you may want to give this stuff a try; or if you have hair, like myself, you can use it to help strengthen your hair follicles. With so much stress in life, I don&#x27;t take any chances on losing my hair. Overall great stuff.</li>
    <li> I received this today and immediately started taking it. I am impressed by the ingredients and I might be able to stop taking my multi-vitamin AND get the added benefit of a great head of hair. Time will tell. I anticipate good things.</li>
    <li> I found this product after buying their Hair Surge Shampoo and using it for several months.  The shampoo was showing good results so why not combine the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has always been my &amp;#34;signature look&amp;#34;, and as I have gotten older my hair has been falling out and&lt;br /&gt;getting so thin.  After trying other products on the market and getting no results, I have finally found&lt;br /&gt;a product that is doing what it claims.  I have been extremely pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t do reviews on products very often unless I feel it could help others.  After using these vitamin supplements I can honestly say I see a real difference in my hair growth.  My hair feels thicker and&lt;br /&gt;stronger, my hair is looking pretty darn good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is really great about this product is that it is all natural.  I personally don&#x27;t like using products that&lt;br /&gt;are full of chemicals and things that are harmful.  But I have gotten such great results that  I felt compelled to give a good review.  I would highly recommend this product.....and just like their&lt;br /&gt;other products it is 100% guaranteed.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Feel so much better taking this natural supplement than a perscription!  Would reccomend it to anyone else experiencing hair loss issues!</li>
    <li> I have thick lovely hair, but it grows so slow. I have been trying to grow my hair for years, with little success. I took biotin and various hair vitamins, used expensive shampoos and conditioners, etc, you name it. One of my friends recommended Hair Maxx saying she noticed how fast her hair grew. I decided to give it a try since actually someone I knew had used the product and had seen the results. It has been a month so far, no difference in my hair. Just ordered a second bottle. I will keep using the vitamins for two more months, as they say you will see the difference after three months. And if nothing happens, I am not going to waste my money anymore, because that stuff is so expensive!!!</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s really doing anything. But when I did start taking it, my top of my head/scalp really was sore. Then I got natures bounty hair, skin and nails, no more sore scalp. I thought DHT was for excess sebum, but I&#x27;m not sure it is. I have to cleanse my scalp everyday or else I get bad sebum built up. I get that from my mom&#x27;s side of the family. I&#x27;ve stopped taking other vitamins, I really don&#x27;t think they did anything because I don&#x27;t feel any different or see any difference since I&#x27;ve stopped taking them due to running out. Saves money on the pocket book. These pills are really really expensive!!!! Even though my scalp started being sore after starting these, I couldn&#x27;t just stop taking them and just throw money out. So I went to the pharmacist for another issue of my one thumb nail that I&#x27;ve had issues with after a orange peel went between my nail and the nail bed. Well the hair, skin and nails are supost to work for that. So thank goodness the soreness went away. I&#x27;m only taking one pill once a day, to last twice as long and I&#x27;m hoping that the sebum might be under control. I&#x27;ve had that problem since I was a kid. I used to wash my hair every three to four days, but I&#x27;d pick at my scalp because it itched soo much because of the sebum forming into (little balls) forms on my scalp. That would make it even worse/greasier. I had longer hair so I bunned it a lot. I&#x27;m back to growing my hair out again. I had bangs because I cut off all the heat damage I had and hated them, so once my bangs were a certain length, I cut my hair myself, I&#x27;m all one length now (youtube videos really helped). I was tempted to buy the shampoo and conditioner, but the price tag of these, ouch, not happening. I&#x27;m using mane and tail shampoo and conditioner for now, then I&#x27;ll be using my other stuff up, I have a lot. I bought more stuff at garage sales, to try out. But I love mane and tail and suave naturals!! I will not be buying anymore of these pills, I got one on sale for $49.00 which is still to much for these.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I started seeing results almost instantly. Hair rush tablets are easy to swallow and they didn&#x27;t have any negative side affects to my daily living habits. I take two tablets with my dinner and a large glass of water everyday. I will be ordering another bottle soon. The seller was also great as far as delivering my product on time as described. I&#x27;m extremely happy with my selection.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says it will! Ever since I started using it my shedding has decreased drastically - amazing!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for approximately 3 months now. When I started initially, I didn&#x27;t notice any improvements on my hair. It remained pretty unchanged for the first month. However, when I reached the 2nd month, I noticed baby (peach fuzz) hair growing. I&#x27;m now at 3 months, and those baby hairs are becoming noticeably thicker. Give it time, and it will work.</li>
    <li> Promotes hair growth and strengthens hair!  I have very fine and thin hair and I was pleased to find that after the 1st bottle I noticed a positive change.  My hair felt thicker and looked healthier.  I anticipate even more of a change after the second bottle.  I also checked the list of ingredients and everything contained in the pills seemed to be quality!  Definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> I used this DHT blocking product when I started to notice thinning in my head.  At times I would scratch my head only to see bits of hair come out in the process.  Within a few weeks of use I noticed my hair getting back to its normal consistency and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> The product that arrived is exactly as described.  Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I have noticed significant results since I started taking the Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx supplements. My hair has been shedding less when in the shower but during brushing or combing, both when wet and dry, is where I really see the difference. The roots feel thicker, too. Overall, my hair feels and looks healthier. I have even noticed my fingernails to be strengthening, too, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting, but is a definite plus!</li>
    <li> This works....expensive but it works</li>
    <li> Product worked as described, I highly recommend it to anyone looking to increase the strength and thickness of their hair.</li>
    <li> i was taking 2tablets per day and could see major change with hair loss within a month. also, i could definitely say that my hair started looking thicker and healthier as well.</li>
    <li> Amazing!  I waited to review this so I could really see the results, it&#x27;s been about three and a half months now.  I can hardly believe the difference in the way my hair feels.  So much healthier and thicker.  I&#x27;m also losing hardly any hair in the shower now.  Love this stuff, will definitely continue to use.  Five++ stars!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! Works as it says it does!I have a family history of thinning in my family and this product reduces hair breakage by 100%!&lt;br /&gt;have fewer split ends, less hair loss and over all thickness of my hair!! Not to mention I&#x27;ve noticed more shine! The pills are smaller than most dietary supplements so they are easy to swallow.  Brushing my hair over the sink used to result in numerous broken hairs covering my counter, floor and sink because my hair was so brittle from excessive coloring and not properly using heat protecting products on my hair, it is now so much stronger and longer I&#x27;ve never been more satisfied!The results became noticeable after a few weeks of taking, combined with the shampoo I am thoroughly impressed.I am in love with the Ulrax Labs products and recommend to EVERYONE!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for awhile now and couldn&#x27;t be happier! I was losing hair fast, pulling hair out of my comb every day, and watching my bald spot grow.  A couple months after I started using Hair Maxx, I noticed less and less hair in my comb each day, all while my hair feels and looks fuller.  I will definitely continue to use this supplement.</li>
    <li> If you do some online research, you will quickly find a number of key ingredients to having healthier hair. I know someone who was serious about her hair and took a lot of time and effort finding the perfect blend of vitamins and herbs in order to stimulate hair growth. The end result was basically a deconstructed Hair Maxx supplement! That&#x27;s what I love about this product, it is all of the best natural vitamins and herbs all put together in one convenient pill. It adds keratin straight back into your hair, as well as other well known boosters, such as biotin, saw palmetto, and the nettle leaf. Literally all you need for thicker, fuller, faster growing, healthier hair. Not only that, but this natural supplement is also good for general body health, especially of the skin and nails, which will show noticeable improvement. I am quite impressed with this product, it is safe and effective for anyone, male or female, teenager or senior. It just makes your hair better! Few things in life can provide such a difference for such little effort, and the confidence boost it provides is well worth the price tag.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Hair Maxx works great with the shampoo I use of the same brand. The Keratin in his product supposedly increases hair growth and I have started to see some new fuzz pop up even faster now that I have started adding it to my regimen. I have also seen a further decrease in the amount of hair I am shedding after a shower and throughout the day; it is thicker and stronger than with shampoo alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical at first, because I don’t often take supplements, but I’m glad I added it. Waiting to see results is the most difficult part for me, when I am trying something new. I am finding that, while it still takes a couple weeks to see results, using a supplement that works from the inside and combining that with a different product hurries the process along a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a convert to this brand; they appear to make quality products.</li>
    <li> I am one month into use and have seen no hair regrowth. I&#x27;m not losing hair at all, but it has become noticieably thinner over the past few years. Gonna give it up to 3 months and will come back for a final review.</li>
    <li> Trust me, this really works, it will stop hair loss and actually help you to grow new hair at bald spots, and it works even better if combined with Ultrax Labs shampoo and conditioner, it&#x27;s really a life saver for me, hope that it will be for you too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my third bottle and did not see any result so far. I&#x27;ve been taking it every day, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to buy another bottle. It doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t work for others though, I suffer from food disorders and have some minor thyroid issues, so that is probably why I have not seen any result?!</li>
    <li> I started this vitamin 1 month ago and I absolutely love this supplement product. My hair seems to be stronger and shiny. I also noticed my nails are stronger and don&#x27;t chip.I would recommend this product to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> It helped to stop shedding hair. In the beginning it made shedding slow down, then it made it stop. My hair is thicker and healthier than before. I ordered my 3rd bottle</li>
    <li> When I first read about this supplement I thought it was too good to be true... until I tried it! It&#x27;s simply amazing and I can&#x27;t believe how great my hair feels.... It&#x27;s MUCH thicker, longer, and healthier. Plus, I&#x27;m only on my second month of trying it! If my hair feels better than this at the 90 day mark, I will be floored. I proudly wear my hair down with confidence everywhere I go!  I can actually style my hair the way I want to now! When people ask what I use, i obviously tell them Ultra Labs Hair Maxx Supplements (aka best product ever!) .. Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx consists of over 20 essentials vitamins, minerals and herbs combined in one blend to give your hair a boost from the inside out. The best part; Hair Maxx is safe and effective for both men and women. I highly recommend this supplement to anyone who desires stronger, healthier, and thicker hair that lasts.</li>
    <li> Me and dear hubby were having a lot of hairfall... At one of point of time I felt I was on chemotherapy since I had really aggravated hair loss... I was afraid of washing hair frequently or even comb them... I ordered 4 bottles of this product (2 months stock for both of us) so as to test its effectiveness... Lo and behold I could see the results almost within a month&#x27;s use... My hair loss is negligible as compared to before... My husband also has less hairfall than before... We ordered our 3 month&#x27;s stock recently... I definitely recommend this product... The only con is the price... Wish it was a bit cheaper... But will still buy this product...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried some other products before, because my whole life, I have always had problem with having very fine thin hair, even had to change my hair style to cover up thin spots after natural times of hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things that I always look for is a product with natural ingredients. Since this product contains both keratin and biotin, I know that&#x27;s a great combination for hair, skin and nails... along with the zinc, B6 and nettle leaf powder and other great natural ingredients. I really like the combination that they have put in here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have gotten really tired of how a lot of those &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; pills are big capsules... so hard to swallow, and to carry around if I&#x27;m not home and sometimes swallowing so many of those can be difficult... I&#x27;ve gotten to the point that I didn&#x27;t even want to take the stuff anymore... so I really like the fact that these are small which makes them much easier to swallow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit expensive, but the 100% satisfaction guarantee so its what makes it easier to try...  so ... really a great find!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Ultrax!</li>
    <li> I used this expensive Ultrax product for 3 months without any good results which is different from all the positive feedbacks for this product. It could be the problem in my hair or there are lots of false feedbacks!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair loss pill out there, I was amazed at how well it worked!!!</li>
    <li> This was my first time actually trying a product of this nature. I&#x27;m so used to trying different moisturizer and applying chemicals that are supposed to promote hair growth. One thing that immediately caught my eye was that I didn&#x27;t have to worry about scalp irritation from directly applying treatments to your scalp. And you need to let it do it&#x27;s job. I started to notice a change around the end of the second maybe the beginning of the third week. Not only will you notice growth but you can expect fuller thicker feel and look. And seeing that will definitely confirm it&#x27;s working. Working so much that my husband got some for his thinning hairline. It&#x27;s my third bottle and so far I got and extra inch on top of my normal growth in six months. Gives you a beautiful shine and confidence that matches it.</li>
    <li> First of all I was very encouraged to see the ingredients listed on the package. I had been advised in the past to take hair vitamins by my hairdresser and never got around to it. Because I don&#x27;t take a multi vitamin I&#x27;m now taking this product which has not only helped with hair loss, but I&#x27;m getting some needed vitamins in at the same time! The Proprietary Hair Stimulating Blend contains some good herbs, supplements and most importantly soluble keratin to aid in hair growth.I am seeing less hair go down my drain in the shower which is also gratifying. I tried this product because I did not think I had much to lose and turns out I was right about that. My hair looks great these days.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about buying this product but after using it for 3 months I am happy to say it is the best decision I have ever made!</li>
    <li> This product is one of the most amazing I&#x27;ve ever tried. My hair was thin and now it&#x27;s thick and actually has volume. I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t find Hair Maxx sooner. I definitely recommend this product to anyone that is experiencing hair loss.</li>
    <li> I starting using this a few months ago because I have been experiencing a lot of shedding, breakage and major thinning near my hairline (edges of my hair were so thin) This has cut down the shedding by about 80% and my hairline has really filled in. One plus I was not expecting is the amount of shine my hair now has. I will continue to take this two times a day. Overall I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> I started losing my hair about 7 years ago. It made me feel very self conscience. I have used numerous amounts of hair growth products and nothing seemed to work for me. At one point i lost hope and gave up totally and just accepted the hair loss and shaved my head. I didn&#x27;t like the bald head look and decided to try other products. I came across Ultrax labs hair maxx and my search was over. I started seeing significant hair growth within the first 3-4 weeks of use. I was amazed by the results so I will continue using this product. Do yourself a favor and get it. Hands down!</li>
    <li> I was prepared to be patient but after taking these pills for a short time I already notice a difference!  My hair would shed in clumps during combing/washing but now it&#x27;s only a few hairs here and there.  I also notice that my edges are filling back in with fine baby hair after being pulled out by wearing wigs and weaves.  They&#x27;re easy to swallow and I haven&#x27;t had any negative side effects; usually, I take them at breakfast and dinner. I&#x27;m excited to see how my hair will be after taking these supplements for a few months.</li>
    <li> I have used this for 3 weeks with no results, I purchased 2 more bottles because Ultrax Labs says that it takes 90 days to see results. If by then I don&#x27;t see any I will stop using it, but if it works I will update my review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month now and have noticed a big difference in my hair...it&#x27;s thicker! I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This product works exactly as advertised. The keratin vitamin supplement does indeed prevent any further hair loss, and I could not be more content with the outcome. I would gladly recommend this product to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> I started taking this alongside pura d&#x27;or shampoo.  Noticed results within 2 weeks with some new short hairs growing along my receding hairline up on my forehead.  At first I wasn&#x27;t sure how much effect each product was having since I took then at the same time.  However I have noticed that my arm and chest hairs are growing thicker and longer and that&#x27;s obviously not from the shampoo which I only use on my head.  Therefore, I would suggest that most of my hair gains are from this product.  I take one pill in the morning and one at night before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 1/8/2015&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve stopped making new gains, but my hair is fuller and thicker and has stayed that way.  My nails need to be clipped more often and all hair including body hair grows faster.</li>
    <li> For the past couple of years, my hair has been thinning.  I finally decided to do something about it.  I have been using this product for sometime and can not believe the results.  Not only do I have new hair growing in, it also seems to be thicker.  I am thrilled!  Would recommend this for anybody.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this for 2 1/2 months.  The directions recommend taking for at least 90 days.  I can&#x27;t see any difference in my hair.  I started taking it in hopes I could grow hair in spots where it seems to be thinning, but it isn&#x27;t working.</li>
    <li> I have been dealing with hair loss and hair thinning for awhile due to stress and genetics. I wear a lot of black and it&#x27;s always been an issue, as well as always finding long blonde hair all over my apt and a couch. I used to shed more than a dog! I was solely taking Biotin supplements until I found this. I am pretty sure it&#x27;s all the vitamins as well as Biotin in it - my hair is much fuller and way less hair is on my brush, floor, and clothes after about 2 months of use. Great formula!</li>
    <li> I actually ordered this product by accident,  the supplents were delivered quickly, however the product itself was not effective for me, which does not mean it will not be effective for someone else,</li>
    <li> I have been noticing that I&#x27;ve been loosing more and more hair in the last few months with hairs falling out and breakage. It REALLY hit me when I tied up my hair and the thickness of my pony tail was MUCH thinner than it used to be. And trust me…it was a scary reality that I had to do something STAT.&lt;br /&gt;I did a ton of research and have tried a bunch of different products as well. I stumbled upon this product a few months back and read some positive reviews about it and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;It has been a little over 3 months since I&#x27;ve been using it…and it&#x27;s not like I have a whole new mane or anything crazy like that, but I definitely do notice that I have WAY more baby hairs growing out in the amount of time of trying it. The hair that I have on my head is looking and feeling healthier as well. I think that it&#x27;s probably due to the fact that the product is packed full of natural vitamins, nutrients as well as keratin which I know helps hair grow thicker and fuller. I&#x27;m very positive and happy at this point with my results. I&#x27;ll keep on using this product and will see what comes out of it in the next few months!</li>
    <li> Since I started taking this, my hair has grown back thicker and fuller. It takes a couple weeks to see results, but is is worth it. Everyone has been commenting on how soft and pretty and full my hair is. My hair also used to look damaged from years of bleaching and is a lot healthier now. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> After having great results from other Ultrax products I decided to give this one a shot too. So far, so good! My hair has stopped falling out and has actually gotten a lot more stronger too. No more dryness or breakage when I style, and my hair has a nice healthy &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; or shine to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m almost down to the bottom of the supply, I&#x27;ll be ordering more to stock up over the winter when the conditions get tougher.</li>
    <li> I gave this supplement as a gift to my dad who is nearing sixty years old and just now showing signs of hair loss. His hair is actually great for his age but I bought him this sort of as a joke (haha you&#x27;re getting old and what not) also since it doubled as a vitamin supplement so it couldn&#x27;t hurt either way. He doesn&#x27;t have bald spots or anything like that but his hair is getting noticeably thinner. I visited him at his house three weeks after giving him this supplement and turns out he actually tried it, mostly because it had vitamins and minerals. Surprisingly, I could see a difference in his hair. It seemed to be thicker and almost more colorful. We spent almost a half an hour that day talking about how well the supplement actually worked (also joking about his old age... which is nothing to be ashamed of by the way). He claimed that he noticed a difference in his hair just a week after taking the supplement but I can&#x27;t say for sure if that is true or not. And I&#x27;m sure for someone with much longer hair than my dad&#x27;s that this supplement would take much longer to produce the results desired. But all in all, the supplement produced quality results for my dad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product took my dad&#x27;s great, aged hair and actually made it even better. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but I think its worth it if you&#x27;re desperate to make a slight improvement in your hair.</li>
    <li> Did absolutely nothing.</li>
    <li> After trying other products to stop my hair from falling out, I finally decided to spend the money and get Ultra Labs Hair Maxx. I figured it was worth a try and I&#x27;m glad I did! Not only did my hair stop thinning but, it&#x27;s actually thicker and healthier looking. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and now hope to grow my hair long so, I just re-ordered. :)</li>
    <li> I recently did the &amp;#34;big chop&amp;#34; and cut off all of my hair. I wanted to start new. When I cut down to the virgin hair, I noticed some thinning areas. A friend suggested this product to me and I decided to give it a try. I must say that after I few weeks, I noticed the thinning areas start to disappear and more hair starting to grow in places that I once thought would never grow back. I love this product and would recommend  to anyone who is looking to stop the thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this supplement! First of all, the shipping was extremely fast, which is always a plus. About six months ago I noticed my hair was starting to fall out at an alarming rate. I&#x27;m in my late 20s, and I was really surprised and terrified! I&#x27;m too young to be losing my hair, so I ordered the whole line of ultrax products based on the great reviews. I&#x27;ll admit, I was skeptical at first. I started with the shampoo, and after having good results, I thought I&#x27;d try this. It really makes a difference! After a month I already see less hair on my brush and in the shower. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve been looking for something to stop your hair from thinning or falling out, like i have,  this is the right product for you. With continued use you&#x27;ll notice the constant shedding of hair has stopped, and an increase in hair growth. It has all the vitamins and more your hair needs to look and feel beautiful. I&#x27;m extremely happy with the results, i know you will be too.</li>
    <li> My hair has always been thin, but since using this, Ive noticed that my hair is thicker.  I can t say that its long because I keep it short, but it definitely has gotten fuller.</li>
    <li> Basically a low dose (and very expensive) multivitamin with a few supposedly hair-promoting herbs and spices added. Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed much if any difference after more than 6 months of use. But, as they say, results might vary, and I wouldn&#x27;t discourage anyone from giving it a try just in case--if you have the disposable dough. Based on the listed ingredients, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s like high-priced chicken soup--not likely to do any harm. I&#x27;m a little skeptical of the large number of glowing reviews from people who don&#x27;t seem to have reviewed anything else on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been taking the product for about three weeks and have noticed less hair in the drain strainer every day after a shower.  This tells me that that this product is working and doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do limit my hair loss.  It&#x27;s relief to know I have slowed down the loss.  I am thinking that there is some new growth right on the edge of my hairline too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is fantastic.  I am very pleased with the results I am experiencing.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do a darn thing for me.</li>
    <li> Great product! I was a little hesitant at first to purchase this product and since I really don&#x27;t usually take other kinds of Vitamins for anything else, so I said to myself &amp;#34;Let me give this one a try&amp;#34;. I love my hair to look great and it is a priority for me in my life, so I tried this product and I noticed results very quickly. My hair stopped falling out when I would take a shower and after my hair was dry it was soft, smooth and it looked fuller!!! I like the fact that this product is in a pill form because I feel it does not only help my hair but I am pretty sure it gives me additional vitamins. It is a great price for a product like this, great size of bottle that can last you some time. Thanks again for another great product. My hair is looking amazing and I don&#x27;t even have to pay that much for it!!!</li>
    <li> Skeptical about the product but gave it a shot, with in 3 weeks I saw some baby hair coming out from my area where I have thin hair and also less hair in my shower and brush.which means it&#x27;s working:)&lt;br /&gt;Every one with hair problem should give it a try.</li>
    <li> How can you go wrong with a product that contains all of these vitamins and minerals especially Biotin, which is commonly used for hair loss.  As I have started to get older, I started noticing more hair going down the drain in the shower.  Since using this product, there is a less now and no more unclogging the drain!</li>
    <li> Thiis an excellent product. It has worked great for me and has slowed the hair loss. Obviously, it&#x27;s very easy to use and only requires a little patience. This is one of the only products that has worked for me and caused no irritation or effects. The price can&#x27;t be beat as other sites have it for $20 more and it&#x27;s quality is impressive. I would definitely recommend it and plan on buying it again in the future. Shipping was fast and overall great value for the price...</li>
    <li> Makes me have to go #2.</li>
    <li> I just used one month so I didn&#x27;t really see much difference.</li>
    <li> This product is overprice and did not work at all for me. If you&#x27;re having hair loss it is important to figure out what is causing hair loss before you commit to buying anything.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! My hair loss has stopped and I&#x27;ve even started to grow back hair where I had lost it. I&#x27;ve tried other products but none of them have worked as well as Hair Rush.</li>
    <li> This products will grow your hair like crazy. Like it says, it stops shedding to reveal thicker and stronger hair.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone needs to add it to their daily supplement intake. It works to benefit those with thick hair to make it even thicker, and those with less hair to make it fuller. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now. My hair would never grow past my shoulders so I figured why not give this a shot. So far it&#x27;s been pretty good. My hair is starting to grow longer(past my clavicle now) it isn&#x27;t thinned out and It seems to be getting thicker. It also hasn&#x27;t broken my hair. I recommend this for anyone working on growing their hair. It works and does its job!</li>
    <li> I’m 50 years old and for the past few years have noticed that my hair isn’t as thick and luxurious as it once was. I’ve noticed a bit of thinning across my temple area and more than normal hair loss whenever I brush, comb or wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched Amazon for products that could be used to help slow the hair loss and possibly stimulate new hair growth. I found a listing for the Hair Maxx hair growth supplement from Ultra Labs. They also make a Hair Solace Shampoo and Hair Surge Conditioner which, used along with the supplement, could be part of a comprehensive hair growth stimulating beauty regime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The supplement comes in a bottle of 60 tablets. The package directions recommend taking 2 tablets per day. I take my daily does first thing in the morning as I’m waiting for my coffee to brew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hair Maxx Supplement contains a blend of over 20 vitamins and minerals that work together to help strengthen hair from the inside out. This blend of ingredients may help slow hair loss if used on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients in the hair supplement include niacin, vitamin B6, folate, vitamin B12, biotin and pantothenic acid. B vitamins, such as the ones found in the Hair Maxx Supplement, are reputed to prevent premature graying and slow excessive shedding of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair appears to be shedding less now that I’m using the supplement on a regular basis. I haven’t seen any new hair growth, but that could be due to the fact that I’ve just started using the supplement. The package directions say to use for a minimum of 90 days for best results. I plan to continue using the Hair Maxx Supplement from Ultra Labs.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed seeing my mothers face about 30 days after I suprised her with Hair Maxx by Ultrax Labs. Her hair has never been so full &amp; beautiful, she stands by this product!</li>
    <li> I can not comprehend the positive reviews this product have received here.  I used this product for 3 months and the only difference that I noticed was that I started shedding hair from my temples and eyebrows.  As for the top of my head, no difference at all.  Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this, this is a gimmick.  Real people that have purchase this and actually used it, please come forward and share your experiences with this product.  Since you have to use three bottles to see \\&quot;results\\&quot; that comes down to 3 x $60 &#x3D; $180... to lose more hair.</li>
    <li> I picked up a bottle of hair maxx at the grocery store a month ago and have been using it religiously every day. I &#x27;think&#x27; Im seeing changes to my hair line but im not 100% sure. I did notice my nails growing exponentially to the point I need to trim them every few days. I went searching for this on amazon as they are out of this product locally so I just placed my order for my 2nd bottle. I will give it a few more months to make a better judgement of its overall effect. So far no side effects have been noticed, unlike viviscal that I tried before this that gave me horrible acne so I had to stop using that.</li>
    <li> I just received the order and not very impressed with how they are bottled, and the pills look like water pills.  don&#x27;t waste your money. this is a scam I wish I would Of read the bad reviews before purchasing it.  fake 5 star reviews</li>
    <li> My hair loss days are over thanks to Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx! This product not only helps decrease hair loss, but it also speeds up hair growth and has made my hair fuller and thicker than ever before. And the best thing about this supplement? Instant results! Get fuller, thicker hair quickly with a hair growth supplement that really works – Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx!</li>
    <li> I had taken this last year for about 6 months to stop my fine, thin hair from falling out so fast, and then it ran out, and I didn&#x27;t repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a month or so later, I noticed my hair was falling out in the shower and also when I&#x27;d comb it after coming out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately repurchased Hair Maxx and stopped taking my Biotin supplement as this contains that as well. I&#x27;ve been taking two Hair Maxx tablets a day for the past 5 or so months. And I&#x27;m happy to report that my hair loss has stopped. I wasn&#x27;t looking for my hair to grow longer, because it&#x27;s just too thin, I just wanted to retain what little hair I have and the supplements are helping. I won&#x27;t make the mistake of not taking these again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dang, getting older sure is expensive...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with my results so far. I&#x27;ve been taking the vitamins for almost a month now. Getting ready to order my 2nd month&#x27;s supply. I will stick with the recommended dose of 3 consecutive months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed my hair doesn&#x27;t fall out as much after showering or during brushing. The overall size of the clump of hair falling out is smaller. Also, I think I&#x27;m noticing new baby hairs growing along my scalp line. I don&#x27;t know, could be wrong but sure seems like it. Like I said, overall I am happy with the product. I didn&#x27;t notice any excessive oiliness like I have with other products, so that is a plus.</li>
    <li> I added this instead of just using my biotin supplement to  help out&lt;br /&gt;with my hair growth. I use hair surge shampoo that  worked great for&lt;br /&gt;me so hoping I see an additional boost from  using this product in&lt;br /&gt;conjunction. Pills are not very big and  easy to take down, I&#x27;m on my&lt;br /&gt;2nd week so I will update my  review in a bit.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a solution for hair loss and/or thinning, look no further. I&#x27;ve been taking these amazing tablets for about 6 months and my hair has completely improved. Before I heard of Ultrax, I was just taking a generic biotin supplement and was not up to par with Ultrax. My hair improved drastically with just two pills a day. And the beauty of  these pills is that they&#x27;re easy to swallow and do not leave a strange taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair became stronger and thicker. It was a lot more shinier and looked a lot more healthier. I get compliments on how beautiful my hair looks. The beauty behind Ultrax is that it contains a lot more vitamins and minerals than just biotin alone. The results are phenomenal and the price for these tablets are completely worth it,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I definitely recommend this product to anybody who&#x27;s suffering from hair loss,thinning, and/ strength.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all. Take biotin for $6 at Walgreens WAY OVERPRICED!!</li>
    <li> Its hard to tell whether these are working or not. Yes, my hair is improving but I also use the shampoo and minoxidil together, so who knows. Its better to overdue then lose all my hair.</li>
    <li> I have hair that likes to shed, and have noticed significantly less hair breakage since using this product, in conjunction with their shampoo. I also take vitamins everyday so all of that together has helped overall. It has Nettle Leaf Powder, Pumpkin Seed Powder Saw Palmetto (which is also in the shampoo, along with Keratin and all those usual hair growing products. An interesting mix of natural ingredients I&#x27;ve never seen in normal hair vitamins before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Compared to all the Hair Growth Supplements I have taken, this is by far the best.    Not only did it stop my hair from falling out, but it grew even thicker and stronger hairs than I already had.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve went through countless hair growth products and I&#x27;ve finally found the one! I have been using this product for 6 months to help with my hair thinning and to help grow back my edges I&#x27;ve lost due to chemical damage from perms. Within 3wks I began to notice healthy shine to my hair and stub of hair appear where I had chemical damage. In 3 months I&#x27;ve notice hair growth and thickness. The main things I look for in a hair growth product are Keratin (hair protein), Biotin, and Essential Vitamins and this product has all THREE!  I am EXTRMELEY happy with this product, and plan on continuing using it.</li>
    <li> I currently use another Ultrax product (which I love!) and am thrilled with this vitamin supplement to go along with it. I always thought of my hair as healthy and chose to ignore the hairline recession and the (as I thought) slight thinning. But using Ultrax products, in a very short time I have seen my hair become thicker and already have observed new growth. Friends have commented on how good my hair is looking!&lt;br /&gt;  With the wonderful ingredients in this Ultrax supplement, I don&#x27;t really need other vitamins, and nothing in it interferes with my present medications. Am I happy? You bet!</li>
    <li> I have longer, stronger, and beautiful hair now!!! I just can&#x27;t stop smiling!!! I am so happy!!! I have been using Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx DHT Blocking Hair Loss Hair Growth Nutrient Solubilized Keratin Vitamin Supplement. It really works!!! Plus there is no after taste after I take it.</li>
    <li> I am totally impressed with this  product is absolutely revolutionary. I have just recently started to notice that my hair was thinning and hair loss and baldness was imminent  After using this product for just over one month the results were unbelievable ! My hair is more full and I no longer shed  out tons of hair. After trying several different products I was beginning to lose hope. This is a miracle product in a bottle and I would recommend this product to anyone struggling with hair loss. It&#x27;s better to proactive and take control with this product you can feel like you have a choice whether your hair starts thinning or not In my opinion I really stand behind this product combined with the shampoo get your hair ties ready you will need it.</li>
    <li> Somewhat expensive treatment for hair loss.  Didn&#x27;t know it was working for sure until I tried a less expensive but similar product.</li>
    <li> Best product I have found that works so far! love it.</li>
    <li> it has been only 3 weeks but I can see my hair is not breaking and falling as bad....will keep using and keep updating the review monthly.</li>
    <li> Great Product!&lt;br /&gt;My Hair just love it!!&lt;br /&gt;No more hair loss,Hair Maxx really lives up to its name.&lt;br /&gt;A must buy!!</li>
    <li> Ok this products has a lot of reviews, but I had to chime in. This stuff does work, but you have to give it time. It takes time to get in you body and start working, but once it does you will be so happy. It took about a month for me to really see a difference. I noticed that I wasn&#x27;t having to clean up as many stray hairs! It is a pill, but I didn&#x27;t notice any side effects, like up set stomach. I just add it to my regular vitamin regimen. So far I haven&#x27;t noticed too much new growth, but I know I am definitely holding on to the hair I have and that puts a smile on my face.</li>
    <li> I am not a big believer in supplements.However, my constant issues with hair loss / hair thinning made me try&lt;br /&gt;this supplement because I was really impressed with the ingredients of this product.After using this product consistently&lt;br /&gt;for 3 months, I have really started noticing all the improvements.My hair loss has significantly reduced and what more.. I now have healthy looking, lustrous and strong hair.I am sure that the 20+ vitamins, minerals and herbs in this product are&lt;br /&gt;responsible for this change.This product is definitely one of the best hair growth supplement and I would strongly recommend&lt;br /&gt;this product to one and all.</li>
    <li> The ingredients in this product are associated with healthy hair. Keratin is the protein that covers the hair shaft. Other ingredients in this product, including magnesium, zinc and Vitamin B6 are essential for healthy hair. Zinc deficiency is associated with hair loss. Pumpkin seed powder, a source of zinc, is also one of the ingredients in this supplement. Saw palmetto, another active ingredient, acts as an antiandrogen; excess androgen can cause hair loss.This product has a solid combination of ingredients needed for hair growth.</li>
    <li> Since using this product, my hair is thicker and overall healthier. I experience less shedding of my hair and it this product has promoted alot of new hair growth. I recommend this product to anyone who wants healthy hair and who wants to combat hair loss. Great product and I will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> A friend had amazing things to say, when I finally came around to trying myself I was astonished on how well it worked!</li>
    <li> It does work, but take caution taking it everyday as it reccomends.  It left my hair rather oily and it also made me breakout along my hairline.</li>
    <li> This supplement blew me away.  I am a big skeptic when it comes to anything in pill form (and their ability to be properly digested and actually work), but I&#x27;m very happy I took the chance and bought this.  My hair had been falling out for years, and I noticed a huge decrease in the amount of hair loss after taking this for only a couple weeks.  So thrilled!  The other major change I noticed was how I had new hair growth that was definitely thicker than my hair has been since childhood.  Hair Maxx is worth the money.  If you want your old hair back (or just don&#x27;t want to look 20 years older than you actually are), make a move.  This stuff works.</li>
    <li> I really like these, my hair looks full, thick and I swear it grows long so quickly. Besides all of that, my hair also feels healthier which is great.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my husband to use instead of the handful of vitamins and minerals he was taking daily; to help with recession and hair loss. To our surprise, this product really worked! After just two weeks,my husband was shedding significantly less and within the month he noticed new hair growth around the outter edges of his scalp. Also noted was healthier nails and overall better feel and look of the fuller areas of hair. We have reordered and are looking forward to the next months results.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with this product! The number one thing that I immediately noticed was that I was not losing hair like I normally did. I noticed this when I showered because prior to taking this supplement my hair would fall off so easily when I showered and it saddened me to see so much of my hair on my shower&#x27;s drain. I will definitely continue to take this supplement to improve on the thickness of my hair because it has started to thin out now that I&#x27;m in my upper 30s. I&#x27;ve always had lots of thick hair and now it had thinned out, especially near my bangs. I am a satisfied customer and I will continue with this wonderful product!</li>
    <li> This product flat out delivers as advertised!  As a man who has been dealing with thinning hair for years, I&#x27;d just about given up on finding a solution that I didnt have to refinance my house to evaluate.  I was initially skeptical upon reading many of the reviews for Hair Maxx but afterjust several months of using it, I have noticed a significant decrease in my hair loss and even more incredibly, hair beginning to regrow in places where it hasn&#x27;t in a very long time. I am thrilled beyond words and will be reordering more of this wonderful product soon!</li>
    <li> I had doubts at first.  But I have been using this product for a little while and I have seen grave improvements in not only the fullness of my hair but the quality.  My girlfriend has said she can see and feel a noticeable different.</li>
    <li> 1) it works, always the most important thing lol 2) it allows me to continue using straightening/frizz-ease shampoo and conditioners, which was the downside of other products I&#x27;ve tried&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it about a month</li>
    <li> Hair Maxx is a great supplement.  I&#x27;m noticing results after only using it for 3 weeks! I love that it&#x27;s all natural and can be used by myself or husband! I highly recommend this vitamin who&#x27;s looking for a safe, natural and effective way to thicken your hair and to aid in regrowth!</li>
    <li> Works amazing! Does exactly what I wanted! I definitely noticed a significant difference!</li>
    <li> I love this supplement! It combines the best known hair-growth vitamins into one. My hair is thick, strong &amp; healthy.</li>
    <li> I will definitely purchase this product again! Started taking it a month ago and within 2 weeks I started seeing a  big difference. I use to buy bioten pills from CVS and never saw results. My hair is thicker, fuller, no more breakage or thinning. I most definitely recommend this to others!!</li>
    <li> This product is full of great vitamins and nutrients that will really boost my hair growth. I even am going to let my mother and grandmother try a few tablets because they have been complaining about lack of hair/hair loss!</li>
    <li> This product seems to be a quite qualified hair product for the loss of hair. Not only does it give the proper nutrition you need for your hair, hence the keratin, but it also gives you all of your daily vitamins which are essential for your everyday use. The intake of your multivitamins, allows this product to be worth the price, especially if you&#x27;re trying to keep a head full of hair. I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference, so far, but I&#x27;ve felt better, with the vitamin intake, and my hair feels a little softer with the keratin. I am not opposed to this product, I do recommend it if you are looking to have a product that is healthy for you and that has actually seemed to work as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service! Wonderful product! Great value for the money. A must have item.</li>
    <li> i started taking these supplements soon after i gave birth to my little one,&lt;br /&gt;I started experiencing an extreme hair loss, mind you i had went through a horrible depression&lt;br /&gt;a couple years earlier and lost a good amount of hair i already have thin hair but i had a lot of it&lt;br /&gt;I was starting to get a UN-natural hair parting in the back of my head up in the crown area&lt;br /&gt;so i started taking this pill as directed and within the 2nd months i started getting new growth&lt;br /&gt;and my hair length grown at least an inch and my hair loss was to a minimal ...&lt;br /&gt;but i wouldn&#x27;t keep up with purchasing this pills at the time after my first purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Now i went 3 half month with out taking them&lt;br /&gt;And now i purchased a new bottle and have been taking for about  2months but i havent&lt;br /&gt;seen quite the same results. I&#x27;m still experiencing hair loss and these pills wont do miracles but i do believe that they are helping slowly but surely although I taking these pills along with viviscal hair supplement as well,&lt;br /&gt;if in any way i hope my review helped :)</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT ! .....TOTALLY AWSOME .........My Hair Was Thining And Very Broke Off With Damage from Chemicals And Sun Exposure Over The Years And I Was Told About Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx I Just Had To Try It And It Was The Smartest Thing I Ever Done With In A Week I Notice A Diffrance In The Amount Of Damage And it Was Thick &amp; Full......I Have Only Been On This For 2 Weeks. I Recommend This To Any One Who&#x27;s Hair Looking To Have A Full Head Of Hair Again....</li>
    <li> About a month ago, I became worried about my hair starting to recede. A few of my family members have receding hairlines so I was concerned this would start happening to me, too. I would notice in the shower when my hands would have a few strands of hair every now and then when shampooing so I became concerned. I like my hair fairly short so losing it really concerned me. I saw high marks on the Hair Maxx supplement from Ultrax Labs, along with their other products and decided to try this supplement out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of weeks of taking this supplement, I no longer found hair coming out when I was in the shower. My hair feels great and I’m no longer worried about seeing my hair fall out when showering. I’m looking forward to seeing the progress of my hair since this is the first time I’m purchasing this product. I’ll sure be coming back for more great results from the Hair Maxx Supplement from Ultrax Labs. Love it.</li>
    <li> this product works so well and is so cheap.u normally have to pay alot for something like this but not now.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product didn&#x27;t work for me and made my hair fall worse. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised after taking it for 3 weeks.  Not only does it decrease my hair loss but it also makes your whole body feel good.  One of the better vitamin supplements that I have taken,  I was skeptical at first but I am a believer now.  Very easy pills to take.  I will be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> Hair Maxx has proven to be effective for blocking hair loss. It has increased my hair growth noticeably.</li>
    <li> Must buy this product is wonderful works GREAT!! It helped to stop shedding hair. In the beginning it made shedding slow down, then it made it stop. My hair is thicker and healthier than before.</li>
    <li> I have long hair and no matter what I seem to do when brushing or in the shower I always get large amounts of hair coming out. I started taking these about 5 weeks ago. I did start seeing some improvement.  It has started to decrease the amount of hair I&#x27;m losing which is great! I feel that if I keep using it I will get better results</li>
    <li> I have used many other supplements to help increase healthy hair and growth and none compares to this one. Unlike other products this not only gave great visible results within two weeks but it also had no side effects. My hair sheds less and is growing. I defintely recommened this product and will be purchasing more bottles soon.</li>
    <li> BOUGHT FOR MY BOYFRIEND AND IT IS WORKING! IT IS NOT LIKE YOU WILL HAVE HEAD FULL OF HAIR OVERNIGHT BUT YOU WILL HAVE HAIR START GROWING ..JUST LIKE YOUR HAIR. WHEN YOU CUT IT IT TAKES 6 MOS TO GROW BACK THIS IS THE SAME</li>
    <li> It really works! I noticed a difference within 3 weeks. My hair is shinier, thicker, and feels healthier. I’m really happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Hair Rush is the best supplement I have come across so far for my thin and brittle hair. After a few weeks I noticed less hair falling out in the shower. My hair feels stronger and healthier! I plan to continue using this supplement as a part of my daily routine and would definitely recommend it for anyone who wants thicker, stronger, and healthier hair!</li>
    <li> This product works great, I have tried a lot of the topical hair treatments and some have been helpful but wanted to see how supplements could help  with my hair loss. Since DHT is the believed cause of alopecia, I thought this was defiantly worth the try.  Since I started taking the supplements I have notice new hair growth, I am very please and will continue to take it, now if they could just help it grow back in any color but gray, lol.</li>
    <li> For a few months, I&#x27;ve been using this product in conjunction with Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Shampoo (which I also reviewed on Amazon.) Already, the difference is amazing. I&#x27;ve always had pathetically thin hair that I was ashamed of and now I can&#x27;t keep my wife&#x27;s hands out of my hair. I started using the supplement for a few weeks prior to using the shampoo and product definitely works alone. In fact, I could tell within the first several days of using it. Then I decided, why not use the shampoo too? Now I have truly thick hair and nobody in my family can believe it. So you can use it on its own and get results. But I highly recommend using both the supplement and the shampoo together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The supplements may seem pricey. But think about it. It works so quickly (results within a few weeks and thick hair after only a few months for me) that it&#x27;s well worth it. Besides, the confidence it&#x27;s given me is priceless.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works. Though I did combine it with daily brushing of the hair, minoxidil,  and hair strengthening shampoo containing menthol and tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend and it works amazingly. After just a few weeks of use, she noticed a change. Her hair used to be thin with a few bald spots, but now she has new growth in the bare spots and her hair looks fuller and healthier. She even has fewer split ends and almost no hair loss. She swears by these pills after having tried so many other products.</li>
    <li> Very quick shipping, so far I have seen a significant amount of hair growth on balding spots. I can see it working so far. I do recommend.</li>
    <li> My hair was coming out it seemed in hand fulls and the stress of losing may hair was too much for me to grasp at my age. So i researched hair loss and found  that  in many cases it was due to Loss of DHT. I scoured the internet for hours reading and  found this product. After taking Ultrax labs Hair Maxx for about two weeks the shedding stopped to my relief. It now time to reorder and I am pleased to say that my hair is doing much better. Its a good thing I dealt with this issue right away because I now feel like I have a fighting chance to regain a fuller thicker head of hair.</li>
    <li> Before I started taking this supplement, my scalp has been more and more visible over the last few years, and my shower drain and hairbrush were full of hair.  I decided to be proactive before it got worse and found this supplement.  My hair stopped shedding as much, and new hair buds are popping up in the front of my hairline.  I can&#x27;t remember the last time I saw baby hairs on my head!  I think I have this supplement to thank for it!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve only been taking this for under 2 weeks but I have definitely noticed some strong results since starting. First let me say that I do not have any bald spots or thinning hair. I did look for this product to strengthen my hair, decrease the amount of hair I shed (especially while showering), and to have fuller curly hair. Well, like I said since I started I have noticed that not only have I shed less hair during showers but my hair seems to be stronger and fuller. So much so that my girlfriend, whom I did not tell I was taking this, noticed how much fuller my hair seemed. As another plus I personally noticed that my scalp seemed less sensitive than before which is great. I also noticed I had a bit more energy but that&#x27;s probably due to the B vitamins in this product. I will continue to take it and update this later but I am impressed how fast this has worked on me in such little time. Definitely recommend a try.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs&#x3D;great products! This supplement works wonders for hair and nails!</li>
    <li> This product is a lifesaver in a bottle! The keratin supplement is where the magic comes in, good for any kind of hair. Within the first couple of weeks thinning hairs grow back as if they never left! Steady usage will strengthen and revitalize your hairs and reverse unsightly thin spots.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with increasing hair loss throughout the past two years and have been trying different products to help or remedy the situation. I asked around and was given a bottle of Ultrax that my friend&#x27;s husband had been using. Upon use, I noticed within a few weeks visible growth! Granted it takes time for hair to grow, but the fact that I could see new hairs made me very happy. I will definitely be purchasing Ultrax from now on.</li>
    <li> When your hair is thinning you will try anything. And believe me I have tried almost everything. Luckily I was willing to try this supplement to help with my hair regrowth. Hair Maxx is a quick acting supplement, I noticed change half way through the bottle. I started to regrow thicker and stronger hair where it had previously fallen thin. I have not experienced any side effects only the results of my hair coming back. I am so happy to have this shiny hair now after taking Hair Maxx for a few months, I will never go back and keep trying all these failing products.</li>
    <li> I was using Viviscal and didn&#x27;t notice any results and switch. Since using I have noticed my hair is stronger and doesn&#x27;t fall in the shower or when combing.  My hair is stronger and thicker. The product works well and i would recommend to anyone. My hair hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years.</li>
    <li> This is a great product . It has stopped my hair from being so brittle and has help it start growing in thicker again!</li>
    <li> I have been taking this for a while and they are the best pills I have ever spend money on . My hair has grown so much. I would recommend to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for two months...never missing a day...&lt;br /&gt;Did absolutely nothing for my hair....really wanted it to work...but it didn&#x27;t..&lt;br /&gt;May work for others but not for me.....</li>
    <li> I am taking this vitamins for 10 days and until now i dont realized a big change. Maybe my loss hair  is decreasing but the difference is sutil. I will finish the two bottles first, but certainly i bought this hair maxx because the reviews were so positive and i have hope to do the good to me as well.</li>
    <li> Very good experience with the product definitely would reccomend</li>
    <li> I been using Ultrax Labs caffeneited shampoo for sometime and have added the Blocking Hair Loss Supplements for my thinning hair and have seeing fast results. I take the tablet every morning and my hair has begun to grow in areas that was thinning such around my temple and crown, i also dont have the excess shedding i had when washing or combing my hair. My nails are also not as brittle and are growing fast and strong. I am very happy using this product and will continue to use because its the only brand that has shown results that are noticeable. My hair and nails are healthier which makes me happy.</li>
    <li> This  product is really excellent.&lt;br /&gt;I finished one bottle and have a visible difference in the volume of my hair!!&lt;br /&gt;It seems fuller thicker. I have just ordered my second bottle and I am quite optimistic !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so excited to see how my hair will be in 2 more months. I have been taking this product for 4 weeks now and I can already feel the strength of my hair when combing. When running my fingers through my hair, I don&#x27;t see those handfuls of loose hairs anymore. I could also see the new hair coming in at the roots. Still growing out but they look firm and healthy. It gets me soo relieved that I am actually going to have healthy hair again. On a side note, I have also noticed stronger nails, bolder eyelashes and healthy skin! I&#x27;ve been also using the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Shampoo and together I feel my hair is so much healthier, shinier, and stronger than it was 2 months ago.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this supplement because I know it will only get better.</li>
    <li> I hate having to wear a hat because I am embarrassed about my receding hair line. FINALLY a product that works and does what it claims. I cant believe all the time I wasted trying other hair growth products. I can finally feel good about myself again. Its amazing how much more CONFIDENCE I feel now that my hair is coming back. Even my coworkers have taken notice to how much happier and confident I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordering more before this bottle even runs out!! I am truly grateful for this product...this one is a life changer!!</li>
    <li> I notice a lot of people giving praise for this helping to thicken their hair.  I&#x27;ve always had thick hair, so I really can&#x27;t attest to that.  What I can say is I have been balding on my forehead, and this has proved to be an excellent supplement to help grow some of that back.  For years Iv&#x27;e had this problem, &amp; have had to resort to just shaving my whole head.  Now, I actually have to visit the barber for a REAL hair cut!</li>
    <li> I have been taking hair maxx for almost a month now and have noticed that my shedding has severely decreased. I would have a large clump of hair after shampooing and since taking hair maxx I have only a few hairs after washing.&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks more full and shiny. I have tried thickening shampoos, supplements and nothing has provided me with results like this, especially in such a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;I also really like the fact that the ingredients are all natural and I have not experienced any side effects. I highly recommend giving hair maxx a try if you want a more natural way to stop hair loss.</li>
    <li> When I started taking this product within a few weeks my hair felt healthier, thicker and more silky. I have trouble getting my hair to be shiny and healthy with all the hair products and hair damaging tools I use on it. But when I took this hair product it really improved the quality of my hair. I also received many compliments on my hair when the product started working. I have tried many other hair-improving products in the past to fix my damaged hair and nothing worked better or faster than this one. It was also very easy to take, didn&#x27;t have any side effects and actually made a difference in the quality of my hair. I love this product, it exceeded my expectations and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Waste and what a waste of $60 tried to call their customer service 1800 number no one answered and never called me back. Just shave your head and don&#x27;t believe those things specially when it comes to pills.that&#x27;s why they make you take it twice a day so you can run out quicker and order more what a business.</li>
    <li> I got this product a week ago and figure I&#x27;d try it out before writing this review. So far it&#x27;s working just as it said it does and my hair is growing pretty well unlike before where it would just grow short and stop. I haven&#x27;t seen any side effects yet which I consider a good thing.</li>
    <li> With my husband&#x27;s thinning hair conundrum, it felt like time was running out and the situation was getting worse while he experimented with different products. I won&#x27;t name all the ones he tried here, but we tested several of the popular ones that are out. Some of them seemed to work at first but then we were was disappointed. Other ones were overpriced with seemingly no effect (positive or negative) at all. One of our favorite products for hair loss worked pretty good and the price was right, but he got side effects like a runny nose and cold sweats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultra Labs puts out this product that kind of breaks the mold. The basic reason we love it so much is because we can see consistent results. I&#x27;m not a medical expert so I don&#x27;t know the chemistry and biological functions of how this stuff works, but I know that it is effective and doesn&#x27;t cause any side effects. My husband is pleased, and I think he looks way better and more youthful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a solution, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
    <li> After a little over a month of using this product i have noticed a huge difference. I always thought i was just doomed and there wasnt any &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; products out there to help with hair loss. I figured i would give this a try and guess what, i couldnt be more thrilled with the results!!! I felt like my hair was just getting thinner and thinner every single day and with this product i notice a huge difference after showering and brushing my hair. It use to be the drain would be covered with my hair and the brush as well. I hardly see any loss now that i have used this. I am a devoted Ultrax customer. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> If you are losing you hair or beginning to notice some areas of pattern baldness, this is a great product to try.  Essentially, this product accelerates the growth of your hair without any harmful side effects while gaining essential nourishment to hair follicles.  Getting the nourishment to your hair follicles is key for hair growth and restoration.</li>
    <li> I bought this vitamin supliment to help me fight my hairloss. My Hairloss has been a problem in my life for years now and I am simply amaized by the great results. This is the best supliment that I have gotten and I am sure that I will continue to use it in the long run.</li>
    <li> I decided to give this product a chance based on all the wonderful reviews, not just here on Amazon but on other product sites as well. I was a bit nervous about making this purchase at first (though I admit it had more to do with my own vanity and admitting I needed a product like this than anything else). But I decided to take the plunge with this one. I&#x27;m very happy with the results so far, and am excited to see how much thicker and fuller my hair is going to be – only an inch of healthier growth at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy after talking to my doctor and finding out that none of the ingredients posed any harm and that the very worst possible outcome was nothing would change at all. Meaning I had nothing to lose by giving it a chance. Even my doctor has started to note the difference (and has pointed out that it isn&#x27;t just my hair receiving a boost, but my nails and skin look healthier and stronger than they have in a while).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall not only am I happy with my purchase but I have started advising my friends and family who suffer from the same hair loss issues I have to look into this product. I would highly recommend it to anyone (and often do).</li>
    <li> You know how pregnant women often have thick shiny hair? Well some of that is due to pregnancy hormones but some is from prenatal vitamins. This supplement has a lot of the same ingredients as an average prenatal vitamin: vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, thiamin, niacin, vitamin B-6, folic acid, vitamin B-12, zinc, fatty acids. And it has more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am NOT a doctor or a pharmacist. I am NOT suggesting that anyone substitute this vitamin for a prenatal – please get professional advice and care if you are pregnant.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for and there are no miracle workers out there.  My hair did not fall out in a couple of weeks (took several years) and I did not expect it to regrow all back in a couple of weeks.  However I was surprised to see my hair was thicker and at about the month mark I noticed new growth (Rogaine takes longer than that).  Understanding nutrition and the body and how this product is packed full of natural vitamins, herbs and nutrients (most problems are associated with lack there of) I stuck with it and am glad I did.  One of the biggest factors is it has keratin.  I did a little research and your hair is made of this natural substance and helps your hair grow thicker and fuller as well.  How much hair will grow at this point is unknown but so far it is looking good.  Will update at the six month mark.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a hair growth formula for the past few years and I am completely satisfied by this one!  My hair has always grown so slowly, and since I dye my hair I have definitely not been helping my situation!  I have noticed a fast increase in my hair growth in the first 90 days.  I am finally growing the normal 1/2&amp;#34; a month length instead of 1/2&amp;#34; every 3 months!  I originally bought this product to help my hair get longer, but am benefiting from the increase in thickness and strength!</li>
    <li> I was having lots of hairloss since supplementing with maxx and using along with their great surge shampoo. I have a full head of hair and even have a gorgeous bob cut that&#x27;s full and thicker. I have better hair then I did in my twenties now.</li>
    <li> The results with Hair Maxx are quite impressive I have to say, and in such short time. My hair is thicker now and I see less hair in the bathtub after every shower. This product has helped me with the struggle of hair loss, no wonder why everybody is recommending it. Plus the delivery was faster than I expected.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product! My wife&#x27;s hair has been much thicker and she has been very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> My hair has been thinning for several years now. I used to take biotin, and it helped at first, but then I needed such high doses of biotin that it was causing my skin to get KP bumps so i stopped using it. But I recently started using Ultrax shampoo and the thickening treatment. I was so impressed with how well they worked -- and how quickly they worked -- that I decided to try this supplement, as well. Even though it has biotin in it, it also has a lot of other nutrients so I am not having the skin issues I had with high doses of straight biotin.  I am really pleased with the results of this supplement! I have to say, though, that I am still using the Ultrax shampoo and thickening treatment, so I&#x27;m not sure what the results would be if I were taking this supplement alone and not using the other products at the same time. But overall, since I began using Ultrax, my hair is undeniably thicker and healthier looking.</li>
    <li> It works great. It was recommended to me and I am happily recommending it as well. It does what it says it will.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my husband.  His hair is very thin at the top. To make a long story short,  he loves the results! Hair has thickened and looks great!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many creams, oils and treatments to help with my hair loss and I had no luck. So I was curious to see how well this would work for me. I checked out a lot of the other reviews and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;ve used biotin in the past, so I was glad to see that not only does this product already have that but it also doesn&#x27;t list any chemicals I should be concerned with. This is an all natural treatment that helps you from the inside out. You don&#x27;t have to worry about putting strange chemicals into your body when you use this product which to me is a big plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month of using this I have noticed growth and I&#x27;m so happy. I have an anxiety disorder that causes me to pull my hair out so the first places I checked where areas I typically pull from. I can&#x27;t find the words to describe how happy I am to no longer have bald spots! I will definitely be continuing to buy this product so my hair can continue to be restored. I&#x27;m so glad I bought this because now I finally have a chance of having the lovely hair I envy seeing on so many other women.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really surprised by any negative reviews here. These are vitamins... Vitamins are essential for healthy hair growth! I have used these for some time now and have noticed significant hair restoration. Of course as with anything diligence and patience is key, also eliminate outside stressors, such as- chemical processing of the hair even smoking which can negate the good effects of these vitamins. I highly recommend them, not only do i notice more hair but also shinier hair as well</li>
    <li> This product has made a world of difference in the state of my hair. After noticing an alarming amount of hair starting to come out in the shower, when I brushed, everywhere all the time, I started taking this. Now, a month later, I have seen a remarkable change in my hair: it&#x27;s thicker, glossier and isn&#x27;t falling out by the handful anymore. It&#x27;s also really helped the wispy little baby hairs I have on my temples start growing in thicker and fuller! I have taken other vitamins in the past to try to combat hair loss, but nothing has worked as well as Hair Maxx.</li>
    <li> Thankyou Ultraxc this amazing stuff.  It has changed my life i love this line of products.  ive tried other products and avoided others due to side affects and this one is showing results without any negative affects.</li>
    <li> I have used keratin treatments on my hair for years and love the results, so I was intrigued by this product when I saw that it contains keratin.  It took a little while for me to see results, but within about 3 to 4 weeks I noticed that I was losing less hair - there was less of my hair in the drain after a shower and less hair in my hairbrush.  About a week or so after that I also noticed some new hair growth in the thinning area at my hairline.  Over time the results have gotten more dramatic - I no longer have any thin spots at all and my hair is generally stronger and healthier looking.  I love that this treats the problem from the inside, giving me hair that is resistant to breakage and falling out. I&#x27;ve been using it for quite a while and have no plans to stop!</li>
    <li> This product actually works and it is truly miraculous. After several weeks of use, I noticed my hair stopped thinning and the fullness coming back to my roots. I also noticed a substantial decrease in the amount of hair loss and my follicles have more life. My hair is now starting to shine and feel less brittle. I definitely recommend Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx DHT Blocking Hair Growth Nutrient Solubilized Keratin Vitamin Supplement for people who want to regrow their hair. I am very impressed with this product and would happily recommend it to my friends and family. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> After initially reading the reviews, I was very excited about trying this product. I&#x27;ve been dealing with thinning hair and have tried everything from at home remedies to pricey shampoo concoctions with little result. After taking this hair supplement for a few weeks, I began noticing fine hairs sprouting up in places I haven&#x27;t had hair in many years. I look forward to further growth and a thickening of my hair.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts, but after trying this for a couple of cycles, I have to admit I like the results I am seeing .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is growing in thicker than it had been. I am losing less of it at night on my pillow, and I am noticing that it has body shone and texture that has been missing for quite some time now. The vitamins have not affected me adversely and I would recommend it to anyone that is curious.</li>
    <li> So far so good! I decided to try this since I&#x27;m familiar with and have had success with most of the ingredients. Since using this product, my hair has been growing faster and is looking really heathy and full.</li>
    <li> No kidding.  I&#x27;m in my sixties and this is one of the products I will not be without!  This is a big problem as women age.  I use short extensions to&lt;br /&gt;fill out my hair.  But this is not cosmetic, it&#x27;s real hair. Also I&#x27;ve able to cut my extension cost in half.  Perhaps it has more impact on me then it may have on others.  It&#x27;s expensive! I always have an extra on hand.</li>
    <li> I Hadn&#x27;t experienced hair loss on a major scale until I decided to grow my hair out. I wanted the ability to try out new hairstyles, (lol NO Mullets I promise) so I began my process and withstood daily shedding; in my bed, my shower, at the gym, on the bus or train, even while working. I first used these vitamins for 4 months and although I noticed a substantial decrease in the amount of hair loss, I stopped my usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shedding increased back to its original amount and then I started using the Extra Strength Hair Surge also by Ultrax, hoping to just grow more hair. After a few months the hair on both my head and face grew stubble and the hair already in place grew longer. Now I&#x27;m awaiting my 2nd bottle of these little vitamins to take my regiment to a newer level.. DOUBLE TEAM! Knowing how effective the two are alone,working together will only double my results simultaneously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I currently shampoo everyday with the Hair Surge and if i skip a day i just give my beard a good thorough washing. Now i&#x27;m looking towards adding the Ultrax Hair Lush Serum to my arsenal and growing my hair out as thick and as full as possible, can&#x27;t wait!</li>
    <li> I think I might be on to something. The product is great. Be patient. Do not expect results in your first day. I am very pleased with the results as it has made my hair feel stronger and it appears I have new growth.</li>
    <li> Thank you Ultrax Labs. After using other products that claimed to grow hair and repeatedly failing, I tried using Ultrax Labs Hair Surge shampoo and experienced truly amazing hair growth,so I decided to add their Hair Max daily hair recovery dietary supplement to my daily routine. Now my hair is growing with the thickness I haven&#x27;t seen since I was twenty years old. Its like magic in a bottle as my hair is not only growing in noticeably thicker, but faster too. Frankly I couldn&#x27;t be more impressed and I will remain a dedicated user of Ultrax Labs hair grow products...because they really work.</li>
    <li> Totally works! After a couple weeks, i noticed a huge change to my hair. Less fallout and got stronger! I will be getting more!!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent!! It&#x27;s EXTREMELY effective and works faster than other products with no side effects. I highly recommend trying this if you are experiencing any hair loss whatsoever. Hair loss can be a bummer but this works wonders to get you back on your A game. I wouldn&#x27;t go with any other supplement.</li>
    <li> Great product! If you suffer hair loss and are using a hair loss shampoo this is a must have addition or even by itself, it really does work. I have tried many hair loss supplements and this one consistently showed results. Do yourself a favor and try it!</li>
    <li> Best product ever! Def worth the price!</li>
    <li> This product works wonders!  Upon the very first week of using the product, I noticed that my thinning hair was being replaced by thick hair.  Also, I noticed that fewer hairs were being lost as I would comb my hair.  There is also less hair on the floor; my hair is staying on my head, great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has told me that my hair is finally growing back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pill itself is very easy to swallow, and has no aftertaste whatsoever.  Most importantly, there are no side effects to speak of, other than a head full of healthy, luscious hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> Not sure about this yet</li>
    <li> AMAZING PRODUCT, really, try it.</li>
    <li> Great Product! This product really helped stop my hair loss! It&#x27;s good to see that a product works as promised for a change!</li>
    <li> These hair vitamins are better than any other hair vitamin on the market that I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m about to be finished with my first bottle and I&#x27;m loving the results I&#x27;ve seen so far. My usually very dull hair has actually been shiny and very little to no hair breakage which is huge for me as I would see broken hairs just running my hands through my hair. The pill is also small so its easy to swallow. And instead of having to take 5 different pills I can take this one pill that has all the nutrients I need! I  plan to purchase my second bottle soon.</li>
    <li> This is a great combination of vitamins &amp; nutrients and is  designed to maximize and stimulate hair growth. It really works well! I love that it&#x27;s made of vitamins your body needs anyway and the hair growth is a great perk.</li>
    <li> I was having a very big problem of loosing hair: I am on a diet and doing a lot of workout to loose weight. I start noticiing that my pony tail was thiner than it use to be and I was loosing much hair in the pillow and in the shower. I started using the product and the results were amazing, after 20 days I noticed that there was no more hair in the pillow or during the shower falling. It works!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I must start off by saying this product is GREAT!!! Not only have I seen a huge difference in my hair just in the 30 days I&#x27;ve been using it but my friends and family are constantly giving me compliments on my now gorgeous hair. :) I&#x27;m very happy! :) So I had pretty thin hair. Every time I ran my brush through my hair my hair brush would be full of hair. That is no longer an issue. My hair is fuller, thicker, shinier and just all together healthier. This product has not only helped my hair but my nails too. My nails are much healthier and look great. I will continue to use this product. This is a definite 5 star product for me! I&#x27;ve also noticed that this product right now is $15.00 cheaper than it was when I purchased it so I&#x27;d encourage anyone that wants gorgeous healthier, fuller, faster growing hair to purchase now.  I&#x27;m going to!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with hair loss for five years due to hormonal  and genetic factors. I&#x27;ve tried everything! I was skeptical about this product but wow! My hair has grown twice as fast - I know this because I have hair extensions and they are  already out 1 inch in two months - and I have not had  fingernails for over 15 years until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works if you have hormonal or genetic hair loss. There  are many causes of hair loss but this works for those of us  who have normal hair loss due to age and heredity. For $40 a month, I&#x27;m all over this one.</li>
    <li> In all fairness, I am also taking the following vitamins and supplements: Green Tea 315 mg, B Complex 100% DRV, L-Lysine 500 mg, and, sporadically, BioSil, BUT I am absolutely convinced that the Hair Maxx supplement (either alone or in combination with the others) is responsible for the increased volume, length, softened texture, and overall health of my hair and my eyelashes. It is a night and day difference since I started the product two months ago. Today, for the first time EVER in my 38 years of existence, I successfully curled my eyelashes because, for the first time EVER, they are long enough to do so. As long as I continue to see these results, I will continue this combination of product forever and ever and ever.</li>
    <li> I only start using the product.  I will give it time.</li>
    <li> I bought these to stop losing my hair, not to regrow - and it does the trick. Especially when used in conjunctions with some of the other Ultrax products I&#x27;ve purchased. My drains are thanking god for these supplements! Good seller, fast delivery. What more is there to say?</li>
    <li> Glad I tried it.  Notice less shedding already.  Hair feels thicker.  Worth the money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this stuff for a few weeks, but I&#x27;m definitely seeing some new hair growth! Hair loss is scary as a woman, so I&#x27;m glad I found something non chemical to help!</li>
    <li> I have been taking this supplement for almost a month and I believe I am seeing some good results with my hair. After 3 weeks of using the product, my hair is starting to repair itself from sun damage and now has a soft and shiny look. My children also commented that I am showing less gray hair.  I don’t like taking supplements because it usually taste bad and gives me an upset stomach. But I appreciate this product because it’s easy to swallow and easy on the stomach. I also did some research on some of the ingredients. I liked what I read about Nettle Leaf powder, Pumpkin seed powder, Saw palmetto, Biotin and Magnesium, etc. The product also came on time and I have no complaints with the manufacturer. I plan to re-order a second bottle.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Rush is one of the forefront products on today&#x27;s market for hair growth! With over 20 vitamins, minerals and herbs, Ultrax Labs Hair Rush leaves hair shinny, manageable and full of body.  If you are looking for less hair loss and hair growth, Ultrax Labs Hair RUSH is worth the investment! RUSH makes differences and improves self confidences! Being made in the USA, gives us an extreme confidence in this products&#x27; results!</li>
    <li> didnt work at all i think it made it worse</li>
    <li> Hair MAXX vitamins have made my hair loss minimal, no more than what should normally shed. My hair is thicker, healthier and has greater elasticity than it had before. I would recommend this vitamin to anyone who&#x27;s looking to reverse the signs of hair loss and improve the overall care of their hair , to try Ultrax Hair MAXX.</li>
    <li> Great product and awesome ingredients for hair growth!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using the product with another product that I used and saw results from which is &amp;#34; Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo&amp;#34; on the recommended purchase list.&lt;br /&gt;Not only this product for hair loss, but it is good for strengthening the hair and improving skin as well!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the fact that this supplement has not just biotin and the &amp;#34;known&amp;#34; ingredients for hair growth, it includes a lot of essential vitamins, so rather than taking multiple vitamins (which I have researched and found out that it is better to eat multiple of each type of vitamin than take one single multivitamin) but with this, although it is a single pill, you could control the amount of pills you are taking because this includes many vitamins that people take on daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that this is an excellent product for hair loss as well as overall health and I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> My hair never grew this long this fast. Ever since i start using this product i have seen nothing but progress. I had always had a hard time growing my hair out, also i have always had a thinning problem.  With this product i feel hope, no other product i have used have gave me such good results. If there&#x27;s anyone out there having hair growth problems or hair thinning problem. I recommend you to get this product, and not waste your money.</li>
    <li> This product works great - makes my hair feel more healthy and look super shiny</li>
    <li> I am using this product since Apr/2015 , its completed one year since I used this product, but no results and more damaged. No growth and more hair loss. I do not know how this works for others? I simply wasted my money on monthly $59.99.&lt;br /&gt;Based on reviews I chose this product for re-growth my hair, but very disappointed. I thought of more use of this product may show good results, that&#x27;s the reason I have used up to one year. But it damaged more. I don&#x27;t recommend this product for any one as per my experience. I use to buy lot of things from Amazon, but never gave any review for any product , this is the first time I am giving on this ,because of my pain ...!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent supplement to use along with the Ultralax shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are all natural and are specifically involved in blocking DHT and helping to promote hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see as much loose hair as I was seeing before. I am impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product for slowing down or even stopping hair loss.</li>
    <li> As a health care professional, I was extremely skeptical when I ordered this product. In my mind, the ratings were almost too good for something that literally isn&#x27;t regulated by the FDA. However, after taking this supplement for a month or so now, I do feel as though I see a noticeable difference, though I can&#x27;t be sure if this is placebo effect or not. Keep in mind, that if this product did possess the ability to inhibit dihydrotestosterone (DHT, the active form of testosterone), there can be side effects, such as loss in sexual desire and impotence, just like with finasteride, a prescription DHT antagonist that actually works, an is utilized for male pattern baldness. Would I ever recommend this to a patient in a health care setting? It depends on what they have tried in the past, and to what effect. However, as a young practitioner who wants to maintain his full head of hair without using rogaine (works, but can cause transient hair loss in many), sure, I gave it a shot. At the very least, it is something to keep on the forever growing list of supplements to consider when your hair seems thinner.</li>
    <li> No more shedding. Love the thickness. Healthy hair.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs consistent in effective products for hair loss!&lt;br /&gt;Had been taking these off and on but truthfully not using the daily recommended dosage. Started using the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Stimulation Shampoo and the Ultrax Labs Hair Max DHT Blocking Hair Loss Nutrient Vitamin Supplement simultaneously (and as directed) and the results have been impressive! It showed me that in order to get results you have to follow directions to the letter and use the product as a regiment to correct hair loss. I recommend this product to others with hair loss issues!</li>
    <li> Love it! Noticing my hair looking healthy and fuller after as little as 7 days. My nails are also growing Idk if it&#x27;s because of the supplement though. I would highly recommend this product. I also use the caffeinated shampoo.</li>
    <li> no effect whatsoever, surprise by the 300 odd 5 star fake reviews, may work for others , but ridiculous 5 star fake reviews</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working in less than a month already I&#x27;m looking foreward to see how the next 3 months will look</li>
    <li> the reviews on here are all fake.. don&#x27;t listen.. if you look most of them havent reviewed other products..</li>
    <li> Not enough time to tell with one bottle.</li>
    <li> Great supplement!  Has definitely slowed down my hair thinning.  I used to lose handfuls of hair when showering, but now I only see minimal, &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; loss (a ball the size of a marble).  I keep up with my haircuts, so I haven&#x27;t noticed any drastic length growth, but it definitely is growing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also feel like it gives me a general sense of well-being (probably all of the vitamins in it!)  Highly recommend of anyone looking to retain their hair through non-chemical, non-surgical means.</li>
    <li> I chose this product after reviewing maybe 5 or more other products. I have been using vitamins for hair growth for quite a while now; however you must get to the root of the cause which is DHT. The addition of Hair Maxx to my regime has made a drastic improvement in my hair length faster than I imagined. Luv Luv Luv this stuff!!</li>
    <li> I suffer from Alopecia and used to take Biotin and Complete Supplements to help the thinning until I found Hair Maxx, and what I found is it has everything to stop breakage and thinning all rolled into even Magnesium which is excellent for hair, I have seen results and I&#x27;m only on my first bottle I will be placing another order soon.</li>
    <li> I started using this and noticed results within a couple weeks. I started noticing less hair on my brush in the shower. The part that was thinning in the front is definitely thicker. Hopefully it will help regrow some hair in the back. I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Beware .. I got this product and the seal was broke.. I counted the quantity and there were only 49 ... Suppose to be 60 !</li>
    <li> I did my own test and began taking this supplement after having my hair highlighted so that I could tell how much my hair was growing. First of all, let me say that I&#x27;m 36 yrs old and my hair grows REALLY slow, and had begun to thin. I started off taking Biotin which was recommended by my doctor.  Biotin is great. It works. BUT it works really slowly. I am always looking for something to help me with growing my hair and I saw this product featured in a magazine while at my hairdresser. The magazine stated that this is what actresses use when they have to shave their head for movies. I thought, heck, what do I have to lose? I researched the product online and then placed my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I had my boyfriend measure the growth of my hair by my roots. At the 3 week mark, my hair had grown 1.25 inches. At 4 weeks, it was at 1.5 inches. Needless to say, I just ordered a refill. I let all my friends on Facebook know about this product and now they are all ordering it!</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this product! It really works and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. I have seen thinning hair restored and a decrease in hair loss after using this product. I am particularly excited about the ingredients, over 23 essential vitamins on your side to help provide better circulation and hair growth. Not only that, but it is healthy and also contains a DHT blocker that also helps your hair grow again. I am not surprised it is ranked the number one hair growth supplement and I can&#x27;t believe more people don&#x27;t know about this! I will certainly be telling anyone who asks about this amazing product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who was having thinning/balding problems. Based on the reviews, I purchased the product. It took a few weeks and his hair was noticeably thickening.</li>
    <li> Great product. My hair is thicker and healthier than before!</li>
    <li> Very effective, natural and affordable way to stop your hair loss and encourage hair growth. Compared to all of the different hair loss products out there, this is one of the few things my husband has tried that really works and at half the price! Results within just about a month or so!</li>
    <li> Great!!  I love all the ultrax labs hair products.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple months..and I can feel the difference..my hair was thinning around the sides now its growing back..</li>
    <li> My worst nightmare was coming true.  I walked past a mirror and saw a bare spot on the back of my head.  I immediately began researching hair loss products and was lucky enough to find this one.  Luckily taking this every day has made a huge difference in both the volume and length of my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about a month and I was amazed. 80% decrease in fall out! Now just gotta find something to make it grow.</li>
    <li> Where do I collect the money for the good reviews . I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a good amount of money to have all these great reviews , and somehow they all posted within days of each other , it&#x27;s like everybody bought the product at the same time and wrote reviews also at the same time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been scrutinizing my hair since before I started taking these.   After just a few weeks, I really believe that my hair is fuller, thicker and stronger.  My hair has always been fine and I&#x27;ve always envied thicker hair, but lately I&#x27;ve been worried my hair has been thinning, too.  Since starting these, I am sure I see less of my scalp.  I have to say, I am pretty psyched!  Also, no harmful ingredients, so I am not worried about doing damage to my body in any way.</li>
    <li> This hair supplement is without a doubt far superior to regular Biotin or hair, skin, &amp; nails vitamins.  For the past month I have been taking Hair Maxx in addition to the Hair Surge shampoo and Hair Lush thickening serum (both by Ultrax Labs), and the results have been astonishing.  The thickness and fullness I have gained in the past 30 days on my &#x27;Ultrax miracle regimen&#x27; doesn&#x27;t even compare to 6 months of Nioxin&#x27;s similar products.  The great thing about Hair Maxx is that it essentially has everything I used to take all wrapped in one bottle.  Before finding Hair Maxx, I took separate zinc, B6, Biotin, and Magnesium supplements (for hair growth and other health benefits).  Since these 4 things are part of the Hair Maxx follicle boosting complex, I now have 1 vitamin bottle instead of 4!  I take 2 capsules in the morning with breakfast and 2 in the evening after dinner.  It suggests that you take the supplement for a minimum of 90 days, so I have gotten 2 more bottles.  So far, so good!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work, costs way too much money.</li>
    <li> Been using this along with a growth shampoo &amp; conditioner... I&#x27;m definitely noticing a huge difference around my hairline. It&#x27;s only been a few months but I&#x27;m going to continue using. I think it&#x27;s definitely working</li>
    <li> not worth it  hair is still falling out  wish I could receive refund</li>
    <li> I got some of this from a friend who had been begging me to try it since i was stressed out and losing hair. I used it and was happy to see results. In 2 weeks i saw new growth from hairline areas that was see through thin. Would recommend this product to anyone male or female since i&#x27;m now purchasing a bottle of my own.</li>
    <li> Wow!!! The keratin in these vitamins really show improvement!!  I am so glad I convinced my mom to start using them. Because she can see the difference and isn&#x27;t shy of her hair and neither am I!!</li>
    <li> I just bought this item for my father experiencing and excessive loss of hair. I am very positive that this product will make him look young again not baldy. Having read the benefits of the product made me hopeful of the effectiveness and also the positive reviews of the customers. Active Ingredients used is very much reassuring too and this product  also have 20+ powerful vitamins, minerals and herbs added to it made this product a perfect remedy not only for men but women too.  I am excited to surprise my father with this amazing product. I must say, the 100% satisfactory guaranteed logo is very reassuring.</li>
    <li> I started taking this product about a month ago, and my bald spot is gone. It isn&#x27;t as thick as the rest of the hair on my head but there&#x27;s hair there. Thanks to Hair Maxx I&#x27;m no longer self conscious about my hair. This product has really helped me.</li>
    <li> My hair has never looked better or fuller. I love this product. I recommend it to anyone who has ever wanted a head of gorgeous full hair.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product that I highly recommend. My hair started thinning in an alarming rate a couple years ago and I was trying everything.  I was hesitant for a while because they were supplements, but that feeling goes away after the first day. I noticed a big change after a couple days. Until this day, I still use it.</li>
    <li> I tried lots of products for my hair. Hair loss runs in my family, I had inherited it, unfortunately :(...&lt;br /&gt;I had even bought another product from a specialist that is 4 times the price of Hair Rush DHT - which didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I was about to give up on getting my hair back and I tought last minute......what do I have to lose.... Long story short, I am happy I decided to give this product a try as it is the only thing that has worked for me. My hair is now amazing and keeps getting better. You will see imorovements in your hair right away. You wont have to be nervous about spending the money and waiting forever to see results. Get this product now and try it - it absoluty works and I have fallen in love with my hair all over again!!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried other hair supplements for my fine, thinning hair. My hair has been falling out and breaking off for quite some time and the products I have tried had very little results, if any. I discovered the supplements because I have already been using the shampoo which stimulates the scalp and hair re growth serum which helps thicken the hair and have had amazing and fast results. So I read up on the supplements that Ultrax has to offer for hair regrowth and the ingredients alone made me want to buy. Not only is it packed with natural ingredients that are known to stimulate hair growth and strengthening, but the vitamins in the tablet are plentiful. So I tried it, my hair is now improving, it is no longer breaking off and I can see actual regrowth! I have only been using it for about a month now, but definitely ready to reorder and continue using all three products.</li>
    <li> I have been using several products for hair loss and I have tried many different formulas.  However, this is the only product that I have used that I have seen noticeable difference with.  Your going to have to use this product for at least two months before you notice the hair loss stop.  After that time it should decrease or stop significantly.  At least thats what happened for me.  Use this product with confidence</li>
    <li> Hair loss can be a really frustrating experience. I have tried a lot of products with little to no success. To my surprise this product actually works. I took the supplement for about a month. Not only did it stop loss but I also noticed new growth. This is great especially for someone with a receding hairline or spotting. I recommend this to any one experiencing hair thinning or loss.</li>
    <li> Easy to handle pill with no sour or bitter aftertaste, which is still a surprising godsend in this day and age. It feels like it thickens individual strands of hair, so using with a shampoo that increases abundance of healthy follicles has been working great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this product works exactly, but I guess it&#x27;s because it uses keratin like your hair is made of. I&#x27;ve noticed less hair loss when washing/brushing my hair out. I&#x27;m a very stressed single parent and have a very stressful job, so this is a wonderful product to have in my regimen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this supplement for about 4 weeks now, and I&#x27;ve noticed a great improvement. I&#x27;m fairly young, but I&#x27;d been noticing some thinning in my temples for awhile. My hair is already thin, so this had the potential to become fairly noticeable. Within 3 weeks of using this, I noticed that hair was falling less from that area, and didn&#x27;t seem as flat and fine. Now, 4 weeks in, it&#x27;s undoubtedly thicker there, and there are baby hairs growing in those 2 spots that weren&#x27;t there before. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and definitely plan to repurchase.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the buy! Of all the hair growth products I&#x27;ve heard about, this is undoubtedly one of the less daunting and effective.  Whilst most other hair growth supplements have the possibility of causing harm and barely work for long periods of time, Hair Maxx is a safe and highly satisfying product.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! After 90 days you will see true results from this product, you will lose less hair and have healthier, fuller hair! Unlike most products of this type, you will not need to wash your hair every day, or several times a week, instead you will take two capsules a day. Made of Keratin and 20 essential vitamins, minerals and herbs, you can trust this product. Give it a try! You will be a true believer!</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair max does exactly as it says it has helped with my hair loss and has made my hair stronger. I can tell a huge difference in the health and overall look and feel of my hair. The best part is that I am getting compliments on my hair from people that dont know I am using it.</li>
    <li> I just started taking this hair blocking supplement and my hair is healthier and fuller already. I have more hair and less falling out after each wash. My hair has more strength in it and I am happy with these supplements.</li>
    <li> Seems like a lot of fake reviews. My doctor doesn&#x27;t even recommend this.</li>
    <li> After 30 days of taking Hair Rush, the hair in my crown has thickened up enough that I don&#x27;t have to wear a bun or fussy up-do to hide my thin spot. I don&#x27;t feel self conscious about the people sitting behind me on the train noticing my scalp. I don&#x27;t take forever in the morning checking my hair from all angles to make sure it looks presentable. The new hairs are still way shorter than my shoulder-length tresses, but that scalp-y, airy look is no longer a concern. I also have a few new wispy hairs along my hairline that weren&#x27;t there before. I&#x27;ll be re-ordering soon to ensure I don&#x27;t lose the progress I&#x27;ve made so far. By this time next year, I hope to be able to wear my hair down again with no worries. I&#x27;ll just keep trimming the rest until this new growth catches up. I can&#x27;t wait!</li>
    <li> After getting amazing result using Hair Surge!!! A friend of mine introduced me to Hair Rush!!! Wow unbelievable results. I love the fact that hair Surge is packed with lot of Vitamins thats nurturing for the whole body! My hair is ultimately Flawless!!! And ridiculously Thick!!!! Thanks Ultrax Labs!!!! You Guys Rock!!</li>
    <li> lucky for me.i already use this product,i use it on my daughter hair as well as myself.it is fabulous, a little to pricey but works wonders.my daughter had braids over the summer and her hair broke off at the ends,i brought 2 of these they were buy one get one free and when school started this fall my daughters hair was back and looking healthy,i have not purchased this from amazon, but the product itself is really worth the price if you can splurge a bit</li>
    <li> My hair seems to be thicker and not as thin, also seems to be growing faster. Will continue to keep using this product</li>
    <li> I have had problems with my hair shedding my entire life. I always find hair on the floor and in the shower drain. I have very thin hair, so the shedding makes it look like I’m losing my hair. After taking Ultrax Labs Hair Rush, my hair feels more healthy and fuller and stronger. I’m also shedding less.  My hair is also growing back and feels stronger. It has definitely stimulated hair growth.</li>
    <li> I am so happy to have finally received my pills, I didn&#x27;t have to wait long to receive the product, the pills are great , the best thing about it is me and my husband both can take the pills, they are light weight and easy on the stomach,  and is a 3 month supply, thank you hair maxx</li>
    <li> This all natural vitamin supplement is safe and effective.  It blocks DHT which is the hormone that causes hair loss.  I know a lot of balding people that could really use this product.  I really like the fact that it is safe and can improve other areas of health since it is a vitamin supplement.</li>
    <li> Feels good to have the fullness back. It was really depressing to have my hair start thinning after pregnancy, but this has just really brought my hair back to life!</li>
    <li> Works very well. My hair has stopped falling out completely and some hair has even started to grow back! Would recommend to anyone struggling with hair loss. Really helps.</li>
    <li> Great product! Worked as described.</li>
    <li> I had no better results with this product than &amp;#34;hair &amp; nails&amp;#34; vitamins from the drugstore that are MUCH cheaper. No miracle here - although, I didn&#x27;t really expect one. In the future, I&#x27;ll save my money and will focus on better nutrition and vitamin supplementation. I&#x27;m getting better results with that.</li>
    <li> I can actually tell that my hair has grown in in spots where it had disappeared, especially long my hairline.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have thinning hair but had a really bad home color hair experience that basically fried my hair. My once thick hair was literally falling out in clumps in the shower.  I started using a topical caffeine shampoo treatment but wanted to also work from the inside out.  I had heard about Keratin based products (Keratin is a protein that is naturally in your hair and in the outer most layer of your skin) getting really good results so I looked around. I was already using an Ultrax Labs shampoo and was really happy so I went ahead and bought the Hair Maxx DHT Hair Loss Hair Growth Nutrient Vitamin Supplement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was a safe choice because  it already consisted of over 20 essential vitamins, minerals and herbs, so if anything, I was getting a good chunk of my daily vitamin and mineral intake taken care of with some good herbs thrown in.  After about 24 days my hair is back to normal and feels even healthier than it did before.  I don&#x27;t even have to use my &#x27;topical&#x27; shine product to make it look shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I don&#x27;t know if it is my imagination, but my skin looks better and so do my nails.  It makes sense though if you read the ingredients on the back like Vitamin E and Biotin.  So safe choice for sure.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product. I have been using it for several months now and I have experienced great results. My hair is growing in thicker, and fuller. It takes about a month or two to see results though. This is an excellent supplement for hair loss, IT WORKS!!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. After using for about a month I noticed significant increase in hair growth and a decrease in hair loss. My hair feels and looks healthier, the vitamins and minerals seem to do wonders for it. The vitamins listed are all ones I should be getting anyway, so not only is it promoting healthy hair but overall health for the body. Taking two pills a day with food is easy to remember and they don&#x27;t upset my stomach like others I have tried. I would recommend this to family and friends.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this product to me and I was skeptical, but it seems to have stopped my hair loss. I have two bad spots where you can see through to my scalp. I am noticing that the hair is getting thicker in those areas. I am still on my first bottle, so I am very impressed with the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product just for the last two weeks. So far, I have no complaints at all. I&#x27;ve looked at the ingredients and nothing stuck out to me as being harmful to my health. The vitamins in the product are known to promote hair growth, so I have no doubt that the product is contributing to my fast hair growth. It&#x27;s been much appreciated because of a &#x27;shaving of the head&#x27; incident I&#x27;m still regretting. My hair is the healthiest it&#x27;s been in years thanks to all the stuff I&#x27;ve been doing for it lately. If this product somehow fails to deliver in the end I&#x27;ll change my opinion. I&#x27;m a fan of the capsules themselves, the ingredients and just the way my hair is looking overall. These supplements almost always work, but sometimes they miss the mark in delivering an overall positive experience. No complaints yet!</li>
    <li> This whole brand is awesome. Have had a great results with this as well as the shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;ll definitely be sticking with this.</li>
    <li> Another amazing product from Ultrax. I saw results in a very short period of time; would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> The 1 star reviews are the only truthful ones, the 5 star people appear to be all fake reviews - look at what they review.  I am glad that I read the  one star reviews before I bought this.</li>
    <li> I just noticed some new hair! It is growing in a place that had very little hair! Thank you Ultra Labs Hair Maxx DHT Blocking Hair Loss! I can&#x27;t wait to see even more hair soon!</li>
    <li> This product is phenomenal! I have been using it for only 2 weeks now and I&#x27;m starting to see the results. Thank you so much! It really helps! It&#x27;s definitely worth it guys.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs make great products for hair loss and thinning hair. This supplement is packed with the essential vitamins and minerals that produce quality results.I was a bit skeptical before seeing the 100% guarantee and am glad I made the purchase. My hair is noticeably thicker and hasn&#x27;t fallen out in the shower as much.</li>
    <li> In about two weeks,  my hair started regrowth in the back and a few days after that,  the front started,  too.  I love hair Maxx!</li>
    <li> This product really works, makes hair thicker and stronger!</li>
    <li> I have had a problem with a seasonal hair shedding since I was a teenager. Every spring and fall my clothes and apartment would get covered in my own hair. And the only solution I could think of was to always be wearing my hair up. Last year I came across Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx and good reviews from people who said it worked great for their, similar to mine, problems. I decided to give it a try and I can see the amazing results already.  Besides my hair not shedding like crazy anymore, I also noticed the overall condition of it changing: increased thickness and healthier look and feel in general. Very much recommended!</li>
    <li> I have been happy with this product.  I was very interested to see the ingredients and happy to see the long list of Vitamins, including B6, B12, Biotin, Keratin and other proven vitamins/minerals that impact the health of hair and are backed by science.  The best news, there were no &amp;#34;mystery&amp;#34; ingredients that I couldn&#x27;t pronounce!  YAY!  This is great for my hair, and It will replace my current hair vitamin!</li>
    <li> The Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx DHT Blocking Hair Loss Hair Growth Nutrient Solubilized Keratin Vitamin Supplement is an excellent product! I bought this product first a month ago while purchasing other products from the Ultrax Labs company to try.  The product contains all the essential vitamins that stimulate hair growth. With this product I can see the actual hair growth, thicker hair, and nail growth! And mind you I use to have the worst nails possible.  Ever since I started taking these pills I&#x27;ve noticed my hair doesn&#x27;t fall out or break anymore and is so soft. I really couldn&#x27;t be any happier with the product, and not even just this product the whole company and line from them is amazing! I recommend this product for anyone who has thin or thinning hair, or even just wants to try and grow a little more!</li>
    <li> I must admit, my hair had started thinning in some places and actually missing in other places around my scalp. Now after taking Ultra Labs Hair Max DHT for under a month my hair has really filled in on my head. I have also tried growing a full beard and it was always patchy, not anymore, my beard is now full and outstanding thanks to Ultra Labs Hair Max DHT!</li>
    <li> Hair Maxx DHT Blocking Hair Loss formula-- in my experience-- is well-conceived, since this supplement blocks the action of DHT within my follicles known to be responsible for uprooting my hair to begin with.  I also use Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo five times weekly to propel hair growth in the newly vital follicles. So, these two work very well together addressing the root of the issue with my hair loss.    Without question it&#x27;s the most NOTICEABLlY beneficial supplement I take, and there a number in my cabinet. I&#x27;ve no negative side effects since starting either though I regret I couldn&#x27;t begin using it in my 20&#x27;s.    I&#x27;m most impressed with the hair on the crown of my head (my biggest concern) is showing some fill-in with the sheer number of new hairs and the shafts a​re comparatively broader and sturdier than before. Quite apparent, because my humble mop is lately withstanding a comb like a real champ. And that hasn&#x27;t been the case for many moons. Oh, pretty magnificent, too, that I am no longer seeding my bathroom/pillows with head hair. That&#x27;s as messy as it is dispiriting. Great product, this supplement, and is really enhanced by combining it with the Ultrax Labs Stimulating shampoo.</li>
    <li> After reading what this product contained I knew it would provide the best results. I am happy that there is such a&lt;br /&gt; Product out there that has a natural feel to it. I am surprised to see such great results, but am  glad  I could count on Ultrax Labs to bring me something worth the money and time. There is no nasty taste that usually comes with some of these products, so that it is a plus. Got yourself a loyal customer here, thank you!</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s a big fat ZERO.  I hope you post what I say as I find there are an awful lot of positive comments which is impossilbe when you read the things people say. If something doesn&#x27;t happen soon, I will definitly not reorder. I am disappointed so far!</li>
    <li> This is just what I needed to stop my hairloss.  Can&#x27;t wait for my hair to be nice and thick again.</li>
    <li> I can definitely tell a difference since I have started taking these! I love that it&#x27;s not just the Keratin for my hair, but other vitamins I need, and forget to take, as well. I also like that they are not huge horse pills I have to choke down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different supplements to help with hair loss after pregnancy and this one is by far my favorite! It really helped to cut down on shedding and I noticed a difference in volume around the hairline within weeks. My hair is fuller, shinier and getting longer by the day! Oh, and my skin and nails also benefited from taking it, too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quickly becoming an Ultrax Labs addict. To put it simply, their products work - this is no exception. Just one week is all it takes to begin noticing results. Increased hair growth, increased thickness, decreased shedding - these are the promises Ultrax makes and they deliver with flying colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love most about Ultrax products (and this supplement especially) is that they are made with natural, safe ingredients. Nothing remotely toxic or dangerous, and this means you can give the supplement a try worry-free. It also means the supplement is simply healthy for your hair and scalp. My own use, supplemented with other Ultrax products, has truly refreshed and revitalized my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this and other Ultrax products a try - you WILL see results. Also, credit due to Beauty Superstore Plus for fast and well-packaged shipping.</li>
    <li> This hair vitamin really helps to grow hair all over your body, and has helped improve my skin and nails as well.  I have noticed my hair is not only longer but thicker as well.  I had some breakage around my hairline from wearing sew-in weaves and that hair has filled in more and is getting longer.  I have tried other hair vitamins before and this one seems to help with thickness, not just length.  Just a heads up, your hair will grow all over your body faster! You have to take the vitamins for a few months and you will notice a change.  Stick with them as your body needs some time to really see the beneficial effects of this vitamin and the ingredients are pretty natural as well.</li>
    <li> I have found that Ultra Labs Hair Maxx DHT not only prevents hair loss but also increases hair growth and thickness. Not only has the  product worked nicely on my hair, but my finger nails seem stronger and I have noticeably more energy. If you want similar results, I suggest you try this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only 20 and I&#x27;ve been having some hair loss issues for awhile I&#x27;ve tried shampoos conditioner and other pills but this actually has been working its been about a month and I can already see the progress of how my hair is growing back and how fuller it looks!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any type of change at all. I would not recommend this to anyone looking for a supplement to help strengthen and prevent hair loss.</li>
    <li> I have used the Ultralax shampoo, conditioner, and now just started taking the Hair Loss Growth Nutrient. Like the other products, this pill works exactly as it says it should. It&#x27;s a vitamin supplement that adds essential nutrients to your hair when your hair does not naturally produce the nutrients. Unlike the Shampoo and conditioner, this product delves right to the root of the issue, skin and hair roots. You will be able to see hair growing stronger out of the root of your head within a month but that&#x27;s also dependent on your hair type. My hair is curly so it took a while but the results are fantastic. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been taking for a month now. I can feel a different in my scalp. I used to have itchy scalp and now no more. I don&#x27;t see any new hair growth yet but will update later on.  I feel tired after taking Hair Maxx so usually take both of them during the night.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different products, and it is clear that this is the one. Hair feels thicker, and I have seen a noticeable difference in using it early on. I highly recommend it, and will most certainly order this product again. Thanks Ultrax Labs!!</li>
    <li> This product really works. I noticed less hair in my brush and in the drain. My hair feels and looks thicker since I&#x27;ve been taking these. This is such a convenient way to control hair loss and get thicker, healthier hair. Money well spent.</li>
    <li> My hair is getting better by the day! my hair sheds too much. Ive tried many products to help improve but nothing until Hair Maxx :) It has helped the growth of my hair. I had become overwhelmed because of shedding especially at the top of my hairline i felt like i was losing more hair there. Hair maxx has actually gave me confidence to fix up my hair up now my hair not so fragile.</li>
    <li> These pills help a lot with hair loss. They keep me from losing any more hair and are making my hair look better.</li>
    <li> Great product, I&#x27;m seeing a lot less hair loss and fuller hair.  People have also made comments saying how thick my hair has become, and it&#x27;s because of using this product.  I recommend using it and plan on continuing to use it.</li>
    <li> At first I was nervous and a little bit skeptical to try this product for my hair loss that I was experiencing due to birth. Also, my hair was always naturally on the thin side so I knew I had to do something, besides just taking biotin. I have to say that I definitely made the right decision, the contents of these pills are all safe and natural, I double-checked with my doctor, and they are even safe for breastfeeding mothers which was a huge positive for me! I have been taking these pills for a week or so, I noticed already that less hair is falling out in the shower and my hair looks and feels fuller. Most pills taste bad to me and hard to swallow, but I had no issues with these, they were just fine. All in all, these are definitely worth the money and I plan on taking them for a while</li>
    <li> These vitamins are awesome. I started using them almostt a month ago and my hair is already beginning to feel fuller and look thicker and longer. I guess it is because my hair has finally stopped shedding the way that it was before and on top of that I think I see new strands of hair growing in like somehow new hair growth has been generated.?!  I am not sure how it works or why it works. I just know that I am experiencing amazing results. I am going to order some more today!</li>
    <li> Out of the variety of ultrax labs products, I&#x27;d have to give this one 10 out of 5 stars. It&#x27;s been about three months since using this product and I&#x27;ve gotten pretty good results so I also purchased a variety of other products including their serum and shampoo. I&#x27;m not yet done with this bottle yet, but here&#x27;s the break down. I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work and the reviews seemed to be flip floppy but I gave it a try anyway. First things first, you will want to give the vitamins a try if you&#x27;re hitting that age where taking care of your body is most important and coming from California my hair is all kinds of crazy. From being dried from this weather to having thin asian hair to everyday stresses college/life can bring me,you name it I got it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The supplementation gave me results along my second to third week. I&#x27;m really meticulous with my hair because who doesn&#x27;t want good looking hair? And even more so, thick looking hair. I&#x27;m not as blessed as my sister in having thick locks, but I can tell the difference a few months in. I&#x27;ve been thinking of slowing trimming my hair to eventually break even with my new hair growth. It&#x27;s not significantly wild to wear I&#x27;m growing a bush but there&#x27;s a noticeable difference in the hair framing my face. My hair loss has minimized and paired with the other products have completely eliminated all together. I can a strand here and there, but nothing compared to the hair I&#x27;m growing back!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any change after three month&#x27;s using</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx DHT Blocking Hair Loss Hair Growth Nutrient Solubilized Keratin Vitamin Supplement - A safe and effective product with key ingredient of Keratin. Two small pills are keeping my shower drain and brush free of clumps of hair. I love that my hair is thicker and healthier. You can’t go wrong with a natural product that shows results quickly!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright. I haven&#x27;t seen any result,  still shedding like crazy</li>
    <li> I wish I had known better when I was younger, no joke science improves every year, Im skeptical very often about those products,but I just gave it a try  few months back ,myself and my wife as well, her hair is coming thicker with a better texture ,her nails as well , it seems to enhance the keratin in our bodies making things grow faster, as far as my hair, it is becoming stronger , with more density on my parts ,the thinning has obviously diminished ,besides it has saw palmetto included which is a mood enhancer ,made in USA ,no bs fillers and no adverse side effects with strong chemicals in it , highly recommended .!!</li>
    <li> I am patient and hopefull it wil at prevent my hair from falling, so.....very dispointed. I have taken these tablets since February until now I saw no RESULTS. Just threw MONEY through the windows.</li>
    <li> This product works and it works in unexpected way as it boosts growth of hair in general. So don&#x27;t expect it to be work only on hair on head but also be prepared to handle hair growth on hands, legs and chest (if you have),&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked so well (on whole body) so I stopped using this one :-(, As I don&#x27;t want be branded as hairy person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is why my rating is 3 as I could not decide what rating to give.</li>
    <li> Really loving this product. Seeing a significant difference in my growth. Doesn&#x27;t leave an aftertaste like many other supplements I&#x27;ve used in the past. Many women in my family suffer from alopecia and I&#x27;ve seen a big loss in hair recently after having children. Price point something I have to be weary of and this is right in my price range. My hair feels thicker and healthier than before. Also have noticed that my eyebrows and lashes are much fuller.</li>
    <li> Wow! amazing that this product is so effective. I love the fact that it is not a shampoo so there is less work involved, all I have to do is take the 2 capsules as directed. It is also amazing having so many natural ingredients and vitamins. My hair not only is starting to shed less but also feels thicker which has given me a huge confidence boost that I have been missing for so long. After while my hair has also started to show stronger roots. Very great product!</li>
    <li> No impact of taking this so far.</li>
    <li> Have tried a number of products similar to Hair Maxx to stop my thinning hair, but hadn&#x27;t really seen the results I was looking for. I&#x27;ve been taking HM for about a month now, and have been pleasantly surprised at the outcome! I&#x27;ve noticed a definite difference in both the thickness of my hair and the amount that I&#x27;m losing! It says for best results to take for at least 90 days, only a third of the way there and I&#x27;m already thrilled!</li>
    <li> If your using other Dietary supplements , stop! because these pills will not work if you are. Have a full course meal when taking these pills it says twice a day so do so. I bought these for my dad and it worked like a charm withing a month. You can defiantly tell the difference. It simply gave him some growth in his hair along with thickness. This product is great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been really impressed with Ultrax&#x27;s products so far to help with balding that I&#x27;m going through. My wife has been experiencing her hair coming off while she&#x27;s in the shower or brushing her hair. When she saw my results, she ordered this supplement to help her with what she was going through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now (after using for about a month and half) she&#x27;s noticed that she&#x27;s not losing as much hair as she used to. Her hair is stronger and she&#x27;s noticed a decrease of hair on her brushes and in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She didn&#x27;t go in expecting results the next day. She was patient and allowed the supplement to work. It&#x27;s definitely paid off!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product.  As a man who is thinning in my younger years I was in desperate need of a product that would give me back the full head of hair I had always wanted.  In no time, I could feel my hair coming in full, healthy, and strong!</li>
    <li> Wow! Second to none! I have been using Hair Maxx for this past month and my hair loss has stopped! I see new hair growth and my hair is fuller! This really works! This product is truly wonderful and very effective! I will get a couple more of these and give to my mom for Christmas!! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I took these hair growth pills until I finished the bottle and believe me they do not work I noticed nothing at all changed. Do not and I will repeat save your money do not buy theses or you will be sorry.</li>
    <li> What ever natural ingredients are in here are good not only for my hair but my general health too.&lt;br /&gt;Hair is not breaking and falling out as much when washing it.&lt;br /&gt;Hair has a good shine and seems to be less &amp;#34;fragile&amp;#34; as I brush it.</li>
    <li> I would just like to let you all know that this product shipped very fast. I started using Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx DHT Blocking Hair Loss Hair Growth Nutrient Solubilized Keratin Vitamin Supplement about one month ago.  I have always had thin hair but with age I have noticed it falling out more in the shower and when I comb it.  Since I started using this product my hair seems to be falling out less.  I will continue using it.  I like the fact that all I have to do is take a pill and I can help out my hair loss.  Ultrax Labs Hair Rush DHT Blocking Hair Loss is a quality product I was skeptical of it prior to using it.  I recommend this product to anyone who is struggling with hair loss or thinning hair like i am. I find this product really works I was skeptical at first.</li>
    <li> I was seeing a lot of my hair falling out in the shower, so I bought hair maxx and it definitely put the brakes on the hair loss. The pills are pretty small, easy to swallow unlike some other pills out there. I wish they came in a larger bottle or multipacks as I will definitely be taking these regularly. They definitely work.</li>
    <li> Not noticed any reduction in hair loss.  would NOT buy again</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair has done it again with these easy to take capsules to prevent hair loss and thicken hair!! You can expect quick results with this high-quality product. The company also ships fast, which is always an added plus for online shoppers. I&#x27;ve personally witnessed positive, thickening results for my hair in a matter of days and look forward to seeing continued hair growth and thickening. I recommend this product to others who are in need of stopping hair loss and promoting thicker hair!</li>
    <li> After using this I&#x27;ve noticed a dramatic improvement in the quality of my hair. Not only has my shedding in the shower decreased but my hair is stronger, fuller, and all in all looks much healthier. Using the Hair Surge shampoo Ultrax Labs also produces along with this vitamin supplement will boost your hair quality and you&#x27;ll see and feel noticeable differences. I would recommend this product for anyone looking for better hair!</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely great product! Although many consumers may skip the scientific explanations, this is one of the only products that actually helps slow down the enzyme that causes hair loss! It really fights the problem at the roots! Taking this product for only about 2 weeks I immediately noticed a stop of shedding and in 4 weeks my hair was actually thicker and healthier! I noticed that some reviewers were concerned about unnatural body hair growth, that is a non-issue. This is not a steroid to stimulate testosterone but a method to block the enzyme (DHT) from forming!&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product, worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Definately make  my nails stronger and hair fallout decreased a lot.</li>
    <li> General improvement in shine and overall appearance and thickness, however i have not used long enough to consider in full.</li>
    <li> This thing is absolutely Amazing , my hair is looking just like it did before, hands down the best product for your hair and for the price, I am highly satisfied !</li>
    <li> After years of feeling so insecure about my hair loss and thinning I have FINALLY found a product I love. I have tried everything on the market and was never happy with the product. Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx has been THE product I have needed all along. My hair has doubled in thickness ( from what it was at it&#x27;s thinnest point), I have received many compliments on my hair and that makes me feel like a million bucks! GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> A good essential supplement for your hair. I&#x27;ve seen significant growth over the last few weeks. I would recommend this product to anyone who falls short of hope.</li>
    <li> This  Didn&#x27;t Work For me  it didn&#x27;t  do Nothing For my hair no changes..  Waste of your money too good to be true.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product from a friend and I am so glad she told me. I have noticed a vast improvement in the amount of hair I was shedding, it seems to help keep my hair follicles in place. I would highly reccommend this product to anyone who is losing their hair. Great product that is effective!</li>
    <li> I went to the skin for a cute pixie cut and came out less than excited:/ fast forward a few months and I was in the awkward hair stage... A friend of mine recommended this product and with nothing to lose I made the investment. So glad I did! 1 month into it and my hair growth doubled if not more. My hair also is very soft and shiny like never before. I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle and telling everyone who will listen about it. I&#x27;ll be back to my normal length soon but I will continue to use this product to keep my hair looking healthy !</li>
    <li> After searching the internet for products to help grow my hair, i just so happen to stumble across this particular one. I have tried products containing vitamin E, jojoba oil, shea butter, coconut oil, etc... None of those products gave me the desired results I was looking for. After taking these pills for 2 months, i saw results immediately. My hair grew 2 inches. I was so shocked and amazed at how well it worked that I recommended it to my mother. She too has issues with her hair falling out but it was due to age. Now, in her case, we saw a big results. Her hair, which is thin, started to grow in thicker and longer. It is so shiny too. My mom is happy and so am I. The price is kind of steep though, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend has really thin hair. I got this for him and it is really working! His hair is ticking so nicely.</li>
    <li> Over the past 5 years or so my hair has slowly gotten thinner and thinner and was getting noticable, i have tried several products and this one is the first one to work!! You only have to take it twice a day and unlike a lot of supplements this one doesn&#x27;t leave the yucky after taste in your mouth, i had no side effects what so ever and within a week i was already seeing a HUGE improvement in my hair, now that it has been over a month my hair feels so full and i see a lot less hair falling out after i brush it.&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered another bottle, i am very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Like so many others who have reviewed this, I love this product. I love that you only have to take 2 once a day - some require you to 2-3/3 times a day! I also think it is wonderful that it is made in the USA. It contains a lot of really high quality ingredients that benefit your body in other ways, in addition to the benefits for hair loss. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the integrity of my existing hair and I&#x27;ve seen regrowth, as well. The pills do not have a bitter taste or leave any aftertaste, as some can. I&#x27;m please with this purchase and would recommend it to another buyer with the same needs.</li>
    <li> This product Works! I noticed a difference in how my hair looked and felt within weeks. My hair was fuller bouncier and overall healthy looking. Others started noticing too and commenting on how lustrous my hair looked.  I will definitely buy this product again and I would definitely recommend it to anyone suffering from thinning or hair loss, or even people who just want better hair.</li>
    <li> This is a life changing product! Your hair will be thicker and stronger after taking this. I would recommend this product to anyone that wants to stop balding. You need to try this wonderful product if you want to start growing back your hair!</li>
    <li> Do not let this product sucker you in. I tried it for 3 months and it did absolutely nothing. 180 dollars down the drain. Don&#x27;t fall trap like I did.</li>
    <li> This product has helped with my hair loss. I have used it for a few months now and it seems to have stopped my receding hairline. I use to see quite a bit of hair in the shower drain and now it much more minimal. I would recommend to anyone trying to stop hairloss.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had thinning hair for a few years now, and have tried multiple hair loss nutrients. I can honestly say that this is by far the best. I saw amazing results in the first week, and the results keep getting better and better.</li>
    <li> Product was as advertised.</li>
    <li> I love this product so far! It&#x27;s great and works better than the Biotin supplements I used to take. I will never stop using this product because it is that good.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for someone who is experiencing hair thinning or hair lost. My hair has been very thin in the past and coming out in the back. It just wouldn&#x27;t grow in the back. But, once I started using this product, I&#x27;ve seen a difference. Trust me when your hair hasn&#x27;t been growing for a long time and you finally find something that makes your hair grow, it&#x27;s amazing. I couldn&#x27;t believe it, so now this product is added to my budget list. Great product!</li>

Ultrax  labs Hair vitamins Supplement is perfectly safe and effective and can be used by both men and women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  i purchased this vitamin from Beauty Superstore and i was just happy with the fast shipping that they have.Thank you for being so professional .</li>
    <li> I had been using Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo for a couple months, and when I went on Amazon to repurchase, at the bottom of the order screen it suggests that the hair growth stimulating shampoo is &amp;#34;Frequently Bought Together&amp;#34; with &amp;#34;Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx DHT Blocking Hair Loss Hair Growth Nutrient...&amp;#34; I was having such luck with the hair growth shampoo that I had to give the DHT blocking product. I love that it is not just a bunch of chemicals, there are plenty of vitamins and minerals which help the hair grow in more naturally, healthy, and thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided it was worth a try, and I have been pleasantly surprised. My hair growth started to grow in thicker, and a little faster.</li>
    <li> Lots of good vitamins and minerals in this product that are beneficial to the whole body health - not just my hair growth.    Makes your hair stronger, healthier, increases volume and shine... also has benefit to eyelashes and eyebrows.    If you&#x27;re taking other multi-vitamin / mineral supplements, you should probably watch to make sure you aren&#x27;t getting too  much cumulative niacin (between all supplements you take)... that can cause a temporary rashy reaction.</li>
    <li> I tried this one based on the good reviews in Amazon.com. After 4 months or so, it does not really seem effective, despite it is one of the most expensive hair growth tablets in amazon.com. I will not purchase again. On the plus side, the tablets are small and easy to swallow and there is no side effects at all.</li>
    <li> My hear stat falling again after stoping taking this product, it wasn&#x27;t really for me...unless if you want to keep buying it every month,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really glad I gave Hair Maxx a chance it has worked wonders at a very reasonable price. I take it with my vitamins and a have noticed a very distinct and positive difference. Looking forward to continued success!!</li>
    <li> I started using Hair Maxx about a year and a half ago after noticing a lot of hair loss in the shower and in my comb.  I also could feel the hair on the top of my head thinning when I ran my hands through it.  Fearful of going bald, I first purchased biotin supplements at the drug store.  I took them for a few months and the only change I noticed was my fingernails grew a lot faster.  My hair felt the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to go online and look for another hair regrowth product and found Hair Maxx.  I found it contains biotin AND many other ingredients to help the regrowth process so I bought a bottle, seeing they had a 100% money back guarantee, and started popping them every day.  After a month, I noticed my hair felt stronger and not as much was falling out in the shower.  After 6 weeks I started to feel baby hairs growing in on the top of my head where I was worried of going bald.  I have been using Hair Maxx ever since and couldn&#x27;t be happier!  This stuff really works and I will keep on buying it!</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with hair loss for quite some time now. I purchased Hair Maxx and started seeing results quickly. I was surprised but it really works. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to regrow their hair.</li>
    <li> The pills came quickly so I did not have to wait as long as stated in order to receive it, and I was able to start taking the pills right away. They were pretty small and easy to swallow so taking two pills did not bother me. The pills also did not have a bad taste so they went down easy. it has only been two days, so I&#x27;m looking forward to improvement by the end of the week.    A COUPLE OF WEEKS IN!!  I am still using the pills and I have noticed a decrease in hair loss/shedding. I am very pleased with this product and have already recommended it to my family members who are  also experiencing hair loss.</li>
    <li> Hi there. I am truly impressed with the shipping speed of this item.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great feature to purchase something and to receive it quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand how, but this works. I used it for a bit and then noticed some stubborn hairs that would not style. That was because they were new hairs that were too short and stubby to bend with the other longer hairs!  Less hair in the shower drain as well!  I am really happy with the product.  The vitamins in this product are working and my hair hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years. My hair is also growing faster which is easy to tell because I color it and can see roots faster now. I decided to give this product a chance based on all the wonderful reviews, not just on Amazon but other product sites as well.  Even my nails and skin look healthier due to the vitamins in there!  I have told my friends and family about it.  I will definitely be a regular user, I don&#x27;t want to be without it!</li>
    <li> I I tried some of the hair growth products and I really had no faith in them because they had not work for me in the past and my brother who had hair loss problems told me about this product that he says is the best solution to my hair thinning problem so I ordered me a bottle and instructions say take two capsules a day with a meal  and in 30 days I noticed a humongous difference instead of seeing balding spots I saw my thin hair growing and new hair starting to grow in I was so elated and thankful that there is a product out there to help me regain some of my youth and vigor</li>
    <li> This really works! I used this for a month and already see improvement from my hair being thick to texture being soft. I recommend this to anyone losing hair!</li>
    <li> I bought one bottle to try it out.  Finished the bottle over the course of one month.  No detectable difference.  I&#x27;m not about to believe the hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviews for this product seem really, really suspect.  Most of the accounts that are \\&quot;verified\\&quot; have only been reviewing things very recently, most of them giving 5 stars to everything.  This, to me, seems like a great marketing ploy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time, this product does contain Biotin.  Personally, I would just stick with tried and true Maxi Hair... at least its been around, been reviewed, has believable positive ratings, and costs 1/3 of the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: Super suspect reviewing practices and product from a shady pharmacist.  Avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** If it can be proven that the other reviews are not false, I am happy to remove this review.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I love the fact that there are so many natural ingredients in it with no side effects. I will continue to order it as it helps and I notice a difference and the best part is I&#x27;m not putting anything bad into my body.</li>
    <li> I am using the product it doesn&#x27;t look like its doing any good I have been purchasing addition  bottles just to give it a little more time see how it works</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s really important to face our health issues from the inside as well as the outside. It makes sense that taking a supplement to help with my hair loss due to menopause. After about a month, I don&#x27;t see as much scalp through my thinning hair. I recommend this to women as well as men! If my mother was still alive, I would be buying for her too. I am a little less embarrassed now, I can see, it working. Well done !</li>
    <li> OK so for the first time I think something is finally going to work for me. Only wish I had started earlier!!</li>
    <li> After months of swearing by ultrax labs hair surge I began looking for ways to enhance my hair growth and thickening. This supplement has done just that! Fewer split ends, less hair loss and over all thickness of my hair!! Not to mention I&#x27;ve noticed more shine! The pills are smaller than most dietary supplements so they are easy to swallow. The results became noticeable after a few weeks of taking, combined with the shampoo I am thoroughly impressed. Brushing my hair over the sink used to result in numerous broken hairs covering my counter, floor and sink because my hair was so brittle from excessive coloring and not properly using heat protecting products on my hair, it is now so much stronger and longer I&#x27;ve never been more satisfied!</li>
    <li> This is a great product that does exactly what it says it will do!  You will quickly notice that you will have less hair loss very quickly and more new hair growth. This is such a amazing product and I am already telling other friends and family to try!</li>
    <li> This product really works, after having read a lot of the other positive reviews I decided to buy and try this product for several months. I did start seeing results after a while and they were more than what I had expected or hoped for. I will definitely be making repeat purchases of this product and using it for years to come!</li>
    <li> These supplements are amazoning, hair is growing faster than normal thanks to the supplement blocking the production of DHT, I have experienced less shedding, also it has eliminated mostly all the breakage, and most important to me is that I feel safe consuming these supplements, All this magic in one bottle and no pain or problems. I love it. Thank you for creating this product, it does as it is claimed.</li>
    <li> Wow I cannot believe this product it is so amazing it really works great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am seeing amazing results and I have a full head of hair again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to encourage everyone to try and use this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so amazed at the results I got and will continue to use this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s amazing you will love this product and use it forever&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this to my personal friends and family&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;again very proven results and works wonders&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so very happy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you have to try this product today order yours now don&#x27;t wait</li>
    <li> I have been battling with thinning hair since I was a teenager. I have tried many products with mixed success but this one really nailed it. I have been using this one for about 6 months before I found it on Amazon. After the first 45 days or so, I realized I hadn&#x27;t asked my husband to clean out the shower drain for a while. Usually every 2 weeks he has to do it because I was losing hair pretty regularly. My hopes were confirmed the following week when my hairdresser Barbra commented on how thick my hair has gotten since she last saw me. This was probably the single most important comment because although she styles well, she usually spends most of the time talking about her and her marriage problems.  The last circumstantial evidence came when my pre-teen son asked if I could buy him some. After questioning him, he said it was working so well for me that it might help him grow a beard!  I don’t know what Pharmaceutical voodoo-science makes it work but it sure does. I would recommend this product highly.</li>
    <li> This has all the natural vitamins and herbs known to help make your hair really healthy. Nettle is also good for your body. Lots of natural ingredients,usr instead of chemical stuff.</li>
    <li> This is amazin! I was really worried about my hair, but it worked and my hair falling has been stopped in 15 days.</li>
    <li> In the past, I posted a review on Ultrax Lab Surge Shampoo. Once I used the shampoo, and witnessed great results I purchased a bottle shampoo for my sister who suffers from Alopecia. Within weeks, T. had hair new growth.&lt;br /&gt;I was so impressed with the results; I purchased Ultrax Lab Hair Maxx. The Keratin in the tablets not only increased the length of my hair, it also strengthen my brittle short nails.&lt;br /&gt;The tablet was easy to digest, with no after taste. First dosage was taken at breakfast and the second dosage with milk before bed. The purchase of both Ultrax Lab hair products has given my sister hope as she struggles with alopecia.</li>
    <li> I have actually attempted every hair regrowth product under the sun from shampoos to prescription spiro and had actually not seen any type of results. I started using Hair Maxx at the end of DEC-Since I have actually begun my hair has actually grown a minimum of 4 inches! My nails have constantly been extremely slim and weak, now they are growing long and lovely. As far as regrowth, I examine my hair every various other week and I see small hairs expanding from my origins (which weren’t there prior to). I have been struggling with baldness for the previous 3 years now and I am only 48 years old so it has actually been a significant hassle and has actually influenced my self-confidence substantially. I have actually had every evaluate done and all of my laboratories come back fine … Given that taking hair maxx and discovering regrowth I am slowly but certainly reclaiming my confidence. I will certainly proceed taking this item for as long as its made. I have had no side effects what so ever before and its being a natural supplement is a huge plus for me</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works but but it definitely works! I have been shedding and thinning and struggling with hair loss for several years now. I  have noticed a slow down in hair loss and my new growth is starting to come in. I am so happy to have found this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been experiencing nominal hair loss recently, but this has already begun to reverse. I attribute the success to a few products I&#x27;ve been trying, none more than the DHT pills. If I skip taking these for any period of time, I notice the difference! While taking this supplement, my hair simply stops shedding! You can find a similar chemical makeup in other supplies as well, but you can&#x27;t beat this price from UltraX labs!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  It dies what it says!!  I will definitely order more.</li>
    <li> This is a great supplement. The Keratin in this has had really good affects on my hair. It promotes hair thickness and I have seen that the quality of my hair has improved. My hair loss is minimal now after taking this for a few weeks. Not only has it helped my hair loss decline but also my hair growth has been increasing. The vitamins and minerals in this supplement have been making me feel healthier from the inside out, and it shows in my hair. Overall its a good product that I would recommend to my family, friends and anyone else suffering from hair loss or slow hair growth.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for blocking hair loss .Contains vitamin. You need to be consistent with the treatment to see effective results. Your you need to try. This product is an excellent option to help. I am really happy with this product.  This supplement is perfect for man and women. I am so amazed with this product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a BULL...wasted 4 month for it....&lt;br /&gt;800 &amp;#34;GOOD&amp;#34; reviews and 0 photos, here you go...</li>
    <li> this really works miracle&#x27;s  I got it as a gift I was a bit skeptical at first but I am sure glad I tried it after about a week or two I started to notice new growth , and to my amazement my hair is still growing .</li>
    <li> Purchase this product and might worth every dime was experiencing  hair loss but no any more. Has been a wonderful  hair booster.  I feel like my hair get getting  more healthy  by the moment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about 1 month into Hair Maxx and so far so good. I have noticed a total difference in just the amount of hair I have in my brush...before taking Hair Maxx I would pull a clump of hair out of my brush, now after I brush my hair there is very little hair to clean out. I&#x27;m impressed and will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> Wow! All I can say is I am impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that this &#x27;blocks&#x27; hair loss, really needs to be emphasized. I was pleased to find out that this exceeded my expectations, in addition to my roommate. After 3-4 weeks of use, we noticed significant results that were far more clear than a placebo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend also combining light exercise with these, as it felt as it the more i sweated, the more i could feel the DHT helping here as my pores opened up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m using this for life. I&#x27;ve found my product, and I really hope all of you find this as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t regret it :)</li>
    <li> My hair grows super fast with these pills.</li>
    <li> I used this last year, and as another user noted, noticed my thinning hair that had been falling out, stopped falling out at such a depressing rate. While I was taking Hair Maxx that almost stopped almost completely. It was noticeable but I didn&#x27;t realize how strong the effects were until I ran out of it. I even noticed a little bit of growth in places I hadn&#x27;t had it before, I was thrilled and was lucky to find it on Amazon to rebuy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. I&#x27;ve been losing my hair for years so it&#x27;s nice to find something that actually helps. I would recommend this to any guy or woman with hair loss issues.</li>
    <li> This product does a good job of stimulating growth and adding texture and body to existing hair.  The best results are achieved by using this product over a period of weeks, at which point little, newer hairs begin to show themselves.  Existing hair seems to be reinforced with a strong and soft feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So many complex procedures out there boasting the results this product brings.  I would start here with this instead of making the heavy investment into a hair procedure.</li>
    <li> I just thought you would like to know that after three weeks of using this product I have, in fact noticed the beginnings of hair regrowth around my temples and the top of my scalp. I don&#x27;t  have a lot of hair to begin with but I feel this will prevent any further loss and hopefully a continuation of regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just thought I would send some positive feedback your way.</li>
    <li> This product works!! Healthier and stronger hair has me feeling more confident, as well as the thickness that it has brought!</li>
    <li> I bought the DHT Blocking Hair Loss Hair Growth Nutrient because I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and noticed thinning/hair loss. It&#x27;s partly genetic, as the women in my family all had the same issues. I previously purchased the Ultra Labs Hair shampoo, which I&#x27;m very happy with but wanted to double my approach with a supplement that would help my hair naturally, from the inside out. I checked out the supplement&#x27;s ingredients and was happy to see the list includes vitamins I usually look for in a multi-vitamin, and the herbs are known for strengthening hair and stimulating hair growth. I&#x27;m happy to have found a hair supplement that offers a combination of healthy vitamins and natural herbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller is wonderful too - fast shipping and good discounts. This is my second order with them, and I&#x27;m sure I will order from them again.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine gave me a bottle to try when I was complaining about so much hair loss. I bought this when I started running out of my other bottle. I&#x27;ve noticed that I have less hair fall out since I started taking the product. When I brush my hair, there are only a few strands in the brush, as opposed to large clumps. I&#x27;ve been giving my husband a pill a day too, and I have noticed that his hair looks fuller. I take one pill a day and have been satisfied with my results (and my husband&#x27;s results) so far.</li>
    <li> The ingredients of this product alone assures that it will bring nothing but positive results. Keratin is known for accelerating hair growth and slowing down the process of hair loss. For those who suffer from thinning hair, it is recommended to use products with Keratin in them. All of the other minerals and herbs will only strengthen the hair that is already present and the hair that will grow in.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this supplement for a little less than a month now. I&#x27;ve had issues with hair growth, breakage, and dry/frizzy hair due to using the straightener too much. I take these with Vitamin E oil and have noticed less hair on my brushes/floor. It says to use for at least 90 days but I&#x27;m already seeing results. Nothing too drastic but definitely an improvement! Very impressed by the pumpkin seed powder, biotin and zinc in the ingredients. Directions are to take 2 capsules a day (it contains 60 capsules) but I only take 1 since my body can be sensitive. Even my boyfriend&#x27;s glad I leave less hair in the shower...haha. I&#x27;ve done research on the ingredients and none are harmful or cause harmful side effects. Family has complimented on my hair after using Ultrax products (shampoo + conditioner) so I&#x27;m adding supplements into the mix. I want my hair to be baby soft and look as beautiful, and luxuriously long as possible. My hair dyeing days are over and now it&#x27;s time to let my natural beauty shine.</li>
    <li> Hi, for everyone who has thinning hair for any natural/genetic reason dont be so quick to judge, keep in mind, there&#x27;s no miracle worker out there however a supplement such as this will help provide some nutrients not available in typical diets and will defenitely boost the results from minoxidils like rogaine. BUT DONT SMOKE or whats the point! smoking shrinks blood vessels and tiny capillaries that deliver hair follicles what they need, and according to my research this product does have some natural extracts that help circulation but smoking defenitely cancels that out!</li>
    <li> I have been taking this supplement for a couple of months now. I bought it because I wanted fuller, thicker hair. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was make much difference. Or, if I would have to wait for months to see results. I am happy to say that within a couple of weeks, I started noticing that my nails were much stronger (bonus!). Then, that there was a lot of new growth hair. Two months on, I can see lots of new growth in the front, now a couple of inches long. I am not sure how this would do for everyone. However, if your hair is fine, or if you want to grow it faster, thicker. This really works!</li>
    <li> I was nervous to start using this, but have been pleasantly surprised! I have been using Hair Maxx for about six weeks now, and I am so impressed with the results. There is the usual shedding but it is shedding less hair, and I saw my hair is thicker when I ran my hand over it. You can view the softened texture that made my hair looked healthy and vibrant. I suggested Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx to anyone experiencing major hair shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first-time buying pills, it is preventive hair loss vitamin contains over 20 vitamins, minerals, and herbs to promote hair growth. Sounds great, right? So what does that mean for me??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things, really. Quality hair supplements block the production of DHT, which stops hair loss at the root of the problem. Hair Maxx does this naturally with saw palmetto and nettle leaf powder, both of which work to block testosterone from converting to DHT in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall not only am I happy with my buying but I have started advising my buddies and family who experienced from the same hair loss concerns I have to look at this product. I would highly recommend it to anyone. Happy Hair Growing!!</li>
    <li> terrible product. don&#x27;t be fooled by fake reviews</li>
    <li> Hair Maxx recommends 90 day consistent use for best results but I have to say I was happy with the results after only 30 days. A lot of hair loss supplements promise instant growth but Hair Maxx is able to deliver if used as instructed. This is because unlike other hair loss products that only contain a couple of essential ingredients, Hair Maxx contains over 10 times this amount. There are over 20 different herbs, minerals and vitamins that stimulate hair growth and promote circulation starting from the inside out; instead of just treating the hair itself. Since it’s Keratin based your hair looks, feels and is stronger, longer and has much more volume. Because the ingredients contain such a large variety of herbs, minerals and vitamins you will notice an improvement in your skin and nails as well. Although Hair Maxx is a hair loss supplement it delivers in many other positive ways as well. I am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I brought Ultra lax Hair Maxx DHT Blocking Hair Loss Nutrient Vitamin supplement. Cause I brought the shampoo +conditioner the month before. I brought the vitamins. I have notice after a month use my hair thicker ,and very soft. Starting to get my edges back. Less shedding and have two inches of growth. Give Ultra Lax vitamins chance, at least a month. You will see results.</li>
    <li> I bought this, had great results and decided to try something cheaper with similar ingredients - bad move. Just reordered and I can&#x27;t wait to get it. I have never written a review because nothing I&#x27;ve purchased meant as much to me as this one, except one. I received a free sample of a menopause, post menopause supplement called Amberen - I love it. I just ordered my first paid order of it and if it continues to give me the results I&#x27;ve experienced so far, I&#x27;ll keep on taking it and write a review for that too. The reason I&#x27;m writing this review is because aging is full of surprises and I assume a lot of people like me have tried.many, many solutions for  many, many things. When something works I want to let everyone know. When it doesn&#x27;t work, I don&#x27;t call everyone t works for a fake or a liar. We&#x27;re not talking about a dress or a shoe or some make-up, we&#x27;re talking about our confidence and well-being. I thank all of you who posted reviews both good and bad - I rely on Amazon reviews whenever I&#x27;m making a purchase.</li>
    <li> Pleasantly Amazed!  My husbands hair has been thinning for a few years now.  I seen the great reviews about Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx DHT Blocking Hair Loss Hair Growth Nutrient and decided to get it for my husband.  My husband and I are both very happy with the outcome.  He&#x27;s hair is more fuller and stronger which has given him more confidence and self esteem......that is priceless.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only using this for a few weeks but I&#x27;m noticing a change in my hair growth already! I just recently got a relaxer but since I&#x27;ve started taking these, the new growth has been rolling in. So far, so good!</li>
    <li> dont know if these work yet! Will keep posted next month. They were delivered very fast!</li>
    <li> My hair has completely stopped falling out, especially in the shower, and I am delighted with the results of this product. I try a lot of hair-growth stimulation products and I definitely appreciate when something actually works as it says it will. My hair feels stronger, stopped coming out in the shower or when I brush it, and I can see fine baby hairs growing in. I have long hair so the new hairs are noticeable. This product is worth trying and sticking to. Prevention and intervention are key with hair loss, and I feel like I finally have it under control with Ultralax Labs.</li>
    <li> This supplement offers additional support for the growth of your hair.  The hair needs the fortifying shampoos and conditioners but this supplement provides the nutrients the body needs to build on the outer treatment the hair is receiving.  The supplements were used for a few months and their has been improvements along with the additional benefits the supplement offers for your health.  Supplements are always a great choice to add to a healthy diet and this products is great!</li>
    <li> Just bought this product.  It was recommended by my daughter-in-law.  It worked WONDERS for her after the third month!&lt;br /&gt;So I ordered this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product not really knowing what to expect but I&#x27;m sure glad I did. I&#x27;ve purchased multiple Ultrax Lab products in the past and found great success with them but taking a supplement for my hair loss was something completely new to me. In the time I&#x27;ve had this product, I&#x27;ve noticed a significant improvement in my hair thinning and falling out. My hair feels strong and no longer falls out when I take a shower. I take two tablets a day, one with breakfast and one with dinner. If you&#x27;re looking for a product that really works, this is what you need.</li>
    <li> After searching around as well as asking people of what to use for hair loss, I ended up doing some research on Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx DHT Blocking Hair Loss Hair Growth Nutrient solubilized Keratin Vitamin  Supplement.  After just 3 weeks of taking this product , it is so obvious that I am loosing less and less hair each day.  Not only does this vitamin supplement help to prevent hair loss it also is making my hair look fuller and healthier than it has in more years than I care to remember.  I just finished ordering another bottle of Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx as I do not want to run out of this product.  I highly recommend this to anyone both male and female who are looking for a proven hair loss growth nutrient vitamin supplement.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I am a big fan of Ultralax &amp; their products. These pills are oval and a decent size that is not hard to swig down with water. To me, the best part is that it does not have a gross aftertaste, although there is the slight smell normally associated with pills. It&#x27;s two a day, so this bottle will last you a month. It&#x27;s a good investment that prevents thinning hair and losing them.</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle and I see lots of new hair growth :) Looking forward to my hair growing crazy lone, I am already getting people commenting on how long my hair is getting :) I mistakenly cut it shoulder length a bit ago and then regretted it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has been worried about his hair thinning out and he is taking this also and says his hairdresser notices a difference :)</li>
    <li> I used this for a month and can say that my hair looked and felt better and I didn&#x27;t lose any additional hair. I would love to keep using this but it is a bit pricey. I&#x27;d love to see it more affordable.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It is very easy to use and the ingredients are ingredients that I have heard of and know about. I think anyone could benefit from this product.  It works well and as a person who cares much about my hair and the upkeep of it, this is a good product.</li>
    <li> Terrible. 30 day supply and says &amp;#34;for best results&amp;#34; use 90 days. Don&#x27;t be fooled....have no idea how and where these great reviews are coming from.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever written a review. I have used every supplement on the market ..including Visceral for over a year, my hair was still falling out by the handful. Almost immediately I noticed less hair loss...now after 3 months I have no hair loss at all...Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Taking these pills along with the surge shampoo &amp; solace conditioner I have noticed a difference in a month.  I&#x27;ve been taking only one pill a day rather then the recommended two a day.  Anyway, I can tell the supplement pills are working because even my fingernails &amp; toenails are growing in stronger and healthier then before I took the pills.  I removed one star because of price - $60 for 60 pills is steep</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 4 months now and have no complaints at all. I&#x27;ve looked at the ingredients and nothing stuck out to me as being harmful to my health. I am very satisfied and impressed by this solution. For those looking for quick effects, check the shower to see how much hair is lost before and after. I can speak from my experience that this product has improved the quality of my hair and the significantly minimizes the amount lost even after the first month!&lt;br /&gt; I have even recommended this solution to a number of folks who I know have similar hair loss concerns. For those who are starting to go through thinning or balding, don&#x27;t delay! Never too early to start getting your confidence back.</li>
    <li> I have been on this product for almost a month and the hair shedding has stopped. However, I am still losing hair just not as fast. As with most products you might not be able to see a difference for at least 3 months, so I will order more. Still a bit pricey!</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Rush supplements are very easy to take, two pills with a meal. I like this because it works to strengthen the Keratin in my hair, and it&#x27;s made of natural ingredients (Saw Palmetto, Pumpkin Seed, Nettle Leaf Powder, Biotin...) Can really feel and see results in 90 days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other hair supplements and usually, I&#x27;ll get some unwanted side effects.  But so far, these are working and I haven&#x27;t had any side effects.  Just take them as directed.  You&#x27;re not going to have waist length hair in a week but with continued use, you will see results.</li>
    <li> I tried more hair products than you can shake a stick at and frankly I was depressed and thought I would never find anything and my hair would just keep falling out. I patiently took these pills really not expecting anything, but I was shocked when my hair stopped falling out and I actually cried with happiness!!!! All I can say is thank you Ultra Labs for making a product that does what it says and produces the results you advertise!! I buy it every month and will continue to buy it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 30s and have been noticing my hair breaking more, and thinning over the last couple of years. I have continued to try to find something that will help. Until now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using it about 2 months (these things take time so I try to be patient ), and I&#x27;m already noticing improvement!  I&#x27;m so excited! I haven&#x27;t had any side effects and I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens after 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have nothing to lose, only gain by giving this product a try.</li>
    <li> I really hope this product works. The other reviews make me hopeful.</li>
    <li> My hair was coming out due to a side effect of other medication I am taking (Seroquel), and I tried a lot of things to get it to stop, from other vitamins to shampoo to foam. This is the first thing that had a noticeable effect, and it did so after the first month of taking it. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any change in hair growth.</li>
    <li> Hair Maxx hair recovery dietary supplement contains a remarkable list of  supplements that have been proven beneficial.  There&#x27;s everything from folate to gingo biloba, and the list of vitamins goes on and on.  The tablets are relatively small and easy to swallow. Keratin, one of the key ingredients is the key structural component for hair and nails. It will take several months to see dramatic results with this product, but the same is true of all products of this type. Ultrax labs shipped the item quickly, and although the product is not inexpensive, you generally get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been losing my hair for years to male pattern baldness, and the hair I did have was thin, and brittle. Using Hair Maxx  for the past few weeks I have noticed a dramatic difference! My hair is thicker, and not so brittle. And I see less of my hair in the shower drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had tried this stuff years ago. I&#x27;m not so sure this product can stop the loss completely, but I am VERY satisfied with the improvement in my hair. I recommend this to anyone with thinning or brittle hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently received my bottle and it has worked exceptionally well, and I plan to buy more in the near future</li>
    <li> in the time I have used this product not only it has helped me with hair loss, but also has helped me to make it thicker and longer,i so recommend it,that&#x27;s why I gave it 5 stars, and i will continue using it.</li>
    <li> I  tried this &amp; it really does stop hair loss for me. I noticed the difference 3 1/2  weeks after using this .  I don&#x27;t have to wear wigs or hats now because my hair looks great . I told my dad and he started using this and he has alot less hair loss also.My aunt saw  the difference  and  she tried it and her hair is not falling out , her hair looks healthy &amp; shiny .</li>
    <li> I tried these on recommendation from a few friends.  They work, and it is so easy to take a couple pills.  I wish I knew about these sooner!</li>
    <li> I have used this product over the past few months and have definitely noticed a difference on the top front of my head. I am convinced that it has made a difference for my thinning hair problem. Improvement in shine and overall appearance and thickness are what&#x27;s most noticeable to me. I&#x27;ve never noticed a difference from any other supplement I&#x27;ve taken like I&#x27;ve noticed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND to anyone looking for help with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Ultrax makes great products! I have slit ends and my hair drops. I have been using this product about a month and it works wonder. At first I was scared, but I am so happy I purchase it. I can see a difference on my hair. It&#x27;s more stronger, looks healthy and the shredding is reducing. I have use other products before and this seems to work so much better. So happy with the results. Thanks Ultrax!</li>
    <li> I really love the way this thickened my hair. I can definitely see and feel the difference. It brought my waves back to life! No complaints and absolutely no extra hair growth anywhere else (lol). Truly recommend.</li>
    <li> I am hoping it works.</li>
    <li> I use a shampoo to thicken my hair and had some good results but wanted an extra boost so started taking Hair Maxx. I like it because it works from the inside out and I&#x27;ve seen great results! My hair is stronger than ever.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to keep my hair shiny and soft. I have short, color treated hair that is hard to manage. I have noticed less hair breakage since taking the Hair Rush. I find that it is easier to style and manage my hair, and new hair looks fuller and appears more filled in on my scalp. Overall, I have found that Hair Rush is a great product, regardless of the fact it is a pill, it is safe and a good alternative to rogaine. It seems to jump start hair growth!</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs has some amazing products. They say what they are going to do and there is a noticeable difference. My hair has gotten softer and stronger with less split ends. They definitely know what they are doing and their products are worth the money.</li>
    <li> I use this product as a supplement for the Ultrax Shampoo that Im already using and I have really seen improvement with my hair growth!  Im also noticing that there&#x27;s less hair on the drain after I shower.  Definitely a must-buy!</li>
    <li> I love this product! It really works: my hair has never been shinier, fuller and thicker. I use it every day and can definitely notice a difference in my overall hair health and growth. I had started to develop hair loss issues and didn&#x27;t know what to do: I knew my diet was not the reason given that I eat healthy. For a girl like me who had always wanted beautiful hair, Ultrax Labs made a real difference. In a matter of months, my hair started to grow again. I have gained a few more inches than usual and I can definitely feel that it is stronger. Most importantly: I stopped losing hair!! On top of that, my hair now has a nice glow which is getting me a lot of comments from people: that never happened to me! It&#x27;s simply incredible! I used to use other hair vitamins but none of them worked for me: I think that the fact that Ultrax incorporates a greater variety of vitamins at a good dosage makes a difference. Also, I have never noticed any stomach problem with this product. I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. My hair is stronger than ever. Thanks hair max!</li>
    <li> I bought this product about a month ago, it has been working wonders on my hair! My hair feels thick, and strong and has definitely reduced the amount of breakage. love it ! thanks</li>
    <li> What can I say? This product works wonders. As with any pill, I was hesitant but did I have to lose? I tried it and man was I impressed. My hair has been thinning for over 6 years now and I must admit I was amazed by the changes I noticed within 2-3 weeks after use. My hair is no longer shedding!!! Amazing!!! I would recommend to anyone with an issue with hair loss to give it a try. The only thing you have to lose is the memory of hair loss. Yay!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking these pills since November. I have noticed hair growth but it hasn&#x27;t helped with my hair falling out. Has anyone else had this! Not sure if I will purchase more if it doesn&#x27;t help with the shedding.</li>
    <li> Works great. Great value and price,i would highly recommend to others</li>
    <li> This Ultrax Labs Hair product took some time to work, but I saw improvement in about 3 weeks. To me that seemed like such a long time. The thin hairs at the front of head, toward my forehead, usually they are short and stubborn, have grown significantly and they don&#x27;t stick out as much as they used to. Also, my hair is softer and grows at a much faster rate than it used to. I use it as the directions say.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed thinning and dullness in my hair over the last couple of years, and after trying out some shampoos and conditioning products that didn&#x27;t seem to do much, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try with all of the great reviews.  I&#x27;ll be honest, this stuff is not cheap compared to other vitamins and supplements I take, and while you can get most of the vitamins and minerals via a good diet or a simple multi-vitamin, there must be something in the &amp;#34;Proprietary Hair Stimulating Blend&amp;#34; that is working because after about 3 weeks, I am definitely seeing a difference. My hair seems fuller, the thin spots aren&#x27;t quite as noticeable, the roots seem stronger and my hair shines more, it looks healthier overall.  Additionally, and I don&#x27;t know if this is connected, but I bite my nails, and I have also noticed that my nails seem to grow back faster too now.  I was skeptical that this would work, but after some promising results after 3 weeks, I think I&#x27;m going to keep taking Hair Maxx for a couple months to see what kind of long-term results I can get.  Very impressed.</li>
    <li> After doing a lot of research, I ordered this product. I had completely damaged my hair from over processing with heat, and it was becoming thinner especially around the hairline. I started taking this product 3 months ago, and soon I noticed was how oily my hair became, and that was within the first 24 hours of taking the supplement. I didn&#x27;t notice any other changes for awhile, only my hair was becoming healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks later I noticed I wasn&#x27;t shedding as much. But now I can see a huge difference in my hair texture. Someone had sent me a picture of myself from 4 months and I was like WOW!! I completely noticed how thick my hairline had gotten. A lot more shine, thicker and fuller hair had made its way to the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the bottom line is YES this product works , you just have to give it time, and as for the growth rate.. I didn&#x27;t notice a huge growth spurt at first but in 5 weeks my hair grew an inch when it usually grows half that !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep taking Hair Maxx as long as its available. Hopefully it stays at this price which is affordable for the results I get.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many hair vitamins and switched to Ultrax because of the high Amazon reviews. Although the price is more on the expensive side, I thought it would be worth it if it worked. I experienced zero change in my hair health.</li>
    <li> My hair has never been Healthier or thicker!!! Love the Product!</li>
    <li> It really is magic, I have been suffering from hair loss and just an over thickness that my hair lacks for years now. After just a few weeks, I am convinced that it works; the patches I used to have, split ends and loss of shine were all improved after using the Ultrax Labs Hair Rush pills. The pills are small and very easy to swallow without any trouble so that is definitely a big plus! I actually combined using both the pills and the Ultrax Labs shampoo together and I think that&#x27;s one of the reasons why I have seen such great results. All-in-all I highly recommend the product and if you can, I would get both and use them together to maximize the results!</li>
    <li> This supplement works, at least for me in conjunction with shampoo and conditioner. I have been using all three for 6 months already, and its one of the only things that improved my hair line for the time being. No side effects at all, and a list of great ingredients.</li>
    <li> I gave this a fair three month shot, and it was a no go for me.  Nada, waste of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the nutrients now for a month I really haven&#x27;t seen any affect. Passing no judgement yet though. Need more time to see if it actually works.</li>
    <li> I begin to notice my hair thinning on top, so I asked my doctor what supplements I should take for my hair to help prevent the continual hair loss.  She basically recommended anything that contains Keratin as a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found Hair Maxx while doing a bit of searching around and it seems to be the most promising keratin supplement.  While there are other supplements available, Hair Maxx seems to be the best choice as it contains other beneficial active ingredients in addition to Keratin such as Nettle Leaf Powder, Pumpkin Seed Powder and Vitamin B6 to promote and enhance hair growth. I ordered 2 bottles and going to give it two months before updating on progress / results. Let’s hope this does something!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It works great!!  I have noticed a significant difference in the amount of hair in the drain after my showers and in my brush. My hair is thin to begin with so I can&#x27;t afford to lose any. I would recommend this product to anybody that experiences any type of hair loss whether it be a little or a lot.</li>
    <li> Works just as it says. Less breakage of my hair, growing faster.A++++++. Works great for my hair.</li>
    <li> I have only been taking these hair growth supplements for a very short time, however, I immediately notice less sheading when I washed my hair.  I make these hair supplements part of my daily vitamin routine.  I feel extremely confident that with continued use my hair sheading with stop all together.  For quite a few years I have been bothered with hair loss and have tried scalp injections, all types of shampoos that claim to stop hair loss with no success. I came across Ultrax while browsing on amazon and decided to give it a try and so far, so good.  I will continue using Hair Maxx because I am becoming more confident with my appearance.</li>
    <li> See the change for the better in my nails from using them and when I stop my nails go right back to being brittle.</li>
    <li> This supplement contains so many wonderful vitamins including B6, Zinc, Magnesium and Biotin.  Vitamins that are so great for your hair as well as your body.  If you want hair that is healthy and grows well, I highly recommend you add this product to your beauty regimen.</li>
    <li> I had heard about this product from a friend who uses it along with the Ultra Labs Caffeine shampoo and is aware that I do use supplements when needed. I was told that the Nettle leaf and Saw Palmetto in this product would help with minimizing damage to the hair follicles and I see that there is a Vitamin B complex included (B-6, 12) as I use that supplement for my eczema as it does help me. I have taken this along with my New Chapter one daily multivitamin for a week and I have noticed that the hair along my hairline has filled in a little as well as having a nice sheen to it. Also, it does not upset my stomach as some vitamin B complex products do. It is winter and my hair tends to be a bit dull due to the harsh weather. Along with the shampoo, I have less breakage and less hair loss while combing and washing my hair. I will continue to use Thanks :-)</li>
    <li> When you have gastric bypass surgery, a little-known consequence CAN be some hair loss. I have very fine, but not terribly thin, hair, but it was falling out during the anaphase, and that was disturbing. So I looked around for something that could help replenish the hair that I do have until telophase when the hair would grow in normally. Thanks to some great reviews, I tried this product and voila, problem solved!</li>
    <li> I use Ultrax Labs, products all the time and ive seen a real explosion of groth in my hair. I think this group of products is great, and im going to keep using it.</li>
    <li> I love that this product is full of vitamins and nutrients, which is exactly what our bodies need, even down to the last hair follicle! So many products are packed with chemicals and in the long run only do more damage, but this stuff provides long term results thanks to it&#x27;s genuine ingredients.</li>
    <li> I’ve tried a lot of vitamin supplements and their effectiveness was limited at best. I was skeptical about another one. There are a million options out there and after sifting through most of them I’d discovered there was very little out there that for than a handful of people had very much confidence in. However I decided to try this because why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was thinning and I was no longer able to grow a thick, full mane like I use to. This was troubling to say the least. So I started taking these. It’s been a few months and I’m happy to report that so far I’m happy with the results. There’s a thickness to my hair again. More importantly others are noticing a difference as well. Just the other day a friend remarked that she thought my hair looked thicker. And she liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To anyone on the fence about this I would say to try it. I like what I’ve seen so far and expect continued success going forward.</li>
    <li> It did not do anything fake reviews</li>
    <li> A friend had given me a bottle of Ultra Hair Maxx to sample when I told her that my hair was coming out when I washed it. I knew that a lot of it had to do with my hormones... but when I tried the bottle of Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx she gave me... I knew I had to purchase a full bottle myself to really see the effects. I am happily surprised that I don&#x27;t see much hair in the drain when I wash my hair now. It has helped my hair become healthier looking and it feels great. Even my friends asked what I was using on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a lot of new hair growth around the crown of my head. A lot of little fuzzies. So this was good news for me. Also my hair doesn&#x27;t seem so dry. I love the natural ingredients, I&#x27;ve taken several of them before, but never in this combination. I am quite satisified with the results and will be ordering my second bottle soon, so I don&#x27;t run out!!</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for a short period of time. I already see a positive and significant difference with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;All the ingredients are safe with no side effects. I strongly reccomend this for anyone with hair loss or thinning hair.</li>
    <li> An excellent supplement formulation for healthy hair.</li>
    <li> I have always had thin hair. A few months ago I noticed it falling out more than usual (lots of hairs in the drain! It was scary!) I&#x27;ve been taking this stuff for a couple of weeks now, and I see a definite improvement. Far less hair is falling out. Also, I can feel little spikes on my scalp when I shampoo that I assume is stubble from hair growing in.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Hair Maxx is a miracle in a bottle. My husband has been taking two capsules per day for 4 months and his thinning hair is noticeably thicker and fuller. The bald spot on the top of his head has become smaller as new hair is coming in. The essential vitamins and keratin in this formula are clearly more effective than the biotin-based formulas my husband has used before. I love running my fingers through his hair again! This product is worth every penny if you want an effective treatment for your thinning hair!</li>
    <li> I have thinning hair and have been noticing bigger clumps falling into the shower when I wash it lately.  I decided to give this a try and I see little hairs growing all over my scalp.  I was a little skeptical at first, but now that I see it&#x27;s working, I&#x27;m amazed!  I take one of the pills every day and slowly, but surely I&#x27;m seeing results.  Yay!</li>
    <li> Amazing ! Only Made The Hair On My Head Grow Faster ! My Hair Grew 2&amp;#34; In One Month &amp; My Ends Don&#x27;t Break Off As Much ! Will Reorder Again !</li>
    <li> Been taking this for about a month and I&#x27;m already seeing improvements. No more hair loss and some of the problem areas (temples and a balding spot on the back of my head) have started to grow a little bit back. It says 3 months for maximum effect so I hope to have a full head of hair again just a few more months. The pills are also a manageable size and pretty easy to take.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders!  I just started my 2nd month and I am so excited to see the end result of my hair growth. I recommend this supplements, and so will you after your first few weeks.</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic before I started using this product, but after reading the online views and seeing on Amazon that it had a 4.5 stars, I had to try it for myself.&lt;br /&gt;Ever since after my pregnancy, my hair was falling out at a fast rate.  I have been trying numerous different things (shampoos and vitamins mostly) and this has actually stopped it from falling out.  Try for yourself!</li>
    <li> This works... I&#x27;ve been using it for about a moth now and I already notice a big difference. This is all that needs to be said!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve finished my first bottle of this stuff.. I was consistent at drinking 2 every eve after every meal. At times I&#x27;d miss the after meals part and drink them prior-to going to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money folks, want to regrow hair? Go the transplant route.. not sure what the other folks are saying about this.. perhaps it&#x27;s the placebo effect but, for me.. no bueno!</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my husband of 20 years.  His hair has thinned quite a bit over the years.  He has been taking them for about a week and we both feel like we can see the thickness of his hair improving.  Can&#x27;t wait to see how much more improvement we see as the weeks go by. I am glad to see him willing to take the health promoting vitamins as well.</li>
    <li> Helps to limit my hair loss.  I ran out of it and noticed the difference when I wasn&#x27;t taking them.</li>
    <li> Love this, I&#x27;ve been balding for a little over three years now and everything else I tried failed MISERABLY! This product has changed my life, it&#x27;s made my hair start growing back, and it&#x27;s as thick now as it was in High School! Wonderful, Amazing product, definitely give it a shot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been losing hair for the past couple of years now. Its been getting worse and worse over time. After taking this supplement, the effects started to wear away slowly, and I began to not lose hair anymore. After a couple months, the hair loss actually reversed and I started to gain some hairs around the top of my head. Doctors told me it would cost thousands for treatment, but this worked a mere fraction of that. I am glad I purchased this item, and will keep using it for years to come.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  My hair has been filling in around the edges. I am Feeling comfortable wearing it in a ponytail.  It  looks healthier and growing longer. It is pricey but What the heck if it is working.  This is the only product that really works and I have used millions for about 17 years including expensive laser treatments.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product and I have seen results. My hair is thicker and stronger than it was before I started using this supplement. Easy to take and well worth the price. Definitely worth a shot!</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference just after a month of using this product. It not only helped the hair loss but also made it feel stronger and shinier. I will definitely continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I would say the best thing about this is not only that hair does grow in faster/fuller, but it actually looks healthier. The shine is amazing and breakage seems a lot less. I once had full, healthy hair, and this helps bring me back to that point, with confidence. I&#x27;ve tried other hair growth supplements and was not as pleased with the outcome. I highly recommend this for someone who wants great results!</li>
    <li> I used it for two consecutive months and did not see any improvement, very disappointing of this product, I have used other products that cost me less then half price of this product and there was at least a minor improvement, I feel I was very stupid buying this product based on the comments from other people here, I hope you dont do as I did. Att. Alberto T.</li>
    <li> I purchased it to my husband. His hair was falling out excessively, especially in shower. After taking Ultrax Labs Hair for a month his shedding decreased dramatically.  I tried it for myself too. After 2 weeks I have noticed my hair became thicker and healthier. So just be patient and wait couple weeks to see the results. You’ll love them!</li>
    <li> It works very well. I noticed less shedding in the shower or when I brush my hair. My hair looks healthier, thicker and doesn&#x27;t break as easily. I have very long hair so I noticed a difference right away. Great product!</li>
    <li> I got this for my dad when he started thinning out, it took about a month but his hair was noticeable thicker, really helped his looks. He&#x27;s happy enough he says he&#x27;ll be buying more soon...</li>
    <li> A great product!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;n not usually a fan of pills or supplements, but this REALLY helped my hair! My hair-loss is hereditary in my family and starts young (late teens-twenties), but with this my hair started to grow fuzz around my temples!!! My hair feels stronger and healthier. It&#x27;s so shiny. I&#x27;ve grown about 2 inches in the past month.</li>
    <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now and I&#x27;m already seeing results.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product after being referred by a friend. After the first day of taking I can say I&#x27;m already looking forward to the benefits of this product. You only need to take 2 for the entire day, luckily the pills aren&#x27;t big. I&#x27;ve tried other supplements for hair growth but found that the ingredients were sometimes too harsh on my stomach. This product is light on your stomach even if you couldn&#x27;t eat a meal at the time of taking it. Great product! I would recommend to anyone looking to try something else for their hair growth efforts.</li>
    <li> My Daughter started loosing her hair years ago after a bad chemical processing by a stylist. Since then, I think hormones, vitamin deficiencies etc. have kicked in and her hair has been thinning and  breaking off. We went to a trichologist in the area and found that her hair follicles are in tact so it IS possible for her to grow hair. He also recommended certain vitamins and nutrients as trichologist believe in growing hair from the inside out. When I first saw this I got excited because it has so many vitamins AND natural ingredients  that are known to improve hair growth.  The pills are easy to swallow and since you only need to take 2 tablets a day it is easy to remember to take. My Husbands bald...I might even get him to try! LOL</li>
    <li> Ever since giving birth, I have become self-conscious about my thinning hair. I was thrilled to see visible results in just a few weeks from using Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx supplement. Now I get compliments regularly about how full and voluminous my hair is! I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is sensitive about thinning hair. This will change your life!</li>
    <li> Great product-- effective, reliable, and worth the (steep) price.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for 3 weeks now and notice a huge improvement in the thickness of my hair. I have virtually no hair loss now, whereas before, when I washed my hair, a frightening amount came out! However, I don&#x27;t notice any difference in the rate at which my hair is growing but it&#x27;s early days . This is a good product and I am very happy with the results so far. This product should be a part of your daily health routine.</li>
    <li> Im ordering my fourth bottle and have some good results as to my babyhair growing finally which was stuck at one inch long since i was ten. Its now 1.5 inches longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair use to grow at an abnormal speed of 1/4 an inch a month now it is at 3/4 of an inch a month. I know because i died my grays and in 2.5 weeks it was a half inch in gray roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair loss had only decreased from about 150 hairs ( yes i counted) a day to 90 approx.  But i use only one pill a day because its so expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, Im a verified amazon purchaser.</li>
    <li> I have been on this product for almost a month and the hair shedding has stopped. However, I am still losing hair just not as fast. As with most products you might not be able to see a difference for at least 3 months, so I will order more. Still a bit pricey!</li>
    <li> This hair product is really good. I recommend it to everybody how is having trouble with their hair. After applying this product 3 times, my hair  stopped falling off. Now it is stronger and brilliant. As a person how worries  about my hair I would use this product all the time.</li>
    <li> This product contains the essential vitamins, minerals, omega fatty acids, amino acids and herbs that I need to add more volume to my hair! I love that it has healthy ingredients like the pumpkin seed powder and the nettle leaf powder. It improves the quality of my hair and provides me with a boost of healthy nutrients too! These capsules are easy to take with a daily meal, and contain the right ingredients to stimulate my hair to grow fuller and thicker.  Great product…great hair…great choice!</li>
    <li> I have used this product before, it works exactly as claimed. I have never found it so affordable, a big plus!! Minimizes hair loss and it makes existing hair full and healthier. I&#x27;m very happy and will repurchase it when I run out. :)</li>
    <li> I was initially thinking what makes this product so different than all other products on the market. Let me start off by saying, you get the benefit of lots of essential vitamins without an &amp;#34;supplement&amp;#34; grainy aftertaste. The minerals and herbs work inside out. My mom has thinning hair due to aging and I suffer from hair loss due to menopause. Its worth it to take a few capsules daily to see results. As a woman, I want to keep a healthy and full head of hair. Start taking Hair Maxx as soon as it arrives to start your journey. Give your body time to absorb the nutrients and you will see results. Stock up!</li>
    <li> This is such an amazing product that amasses the most important ingredients such as vitamins, minerals and herbs that would help your hair grow continuously. It gives your hair that volume, length, and thickness that you are looking for. The function is not perfunctory at all, as it is using the best formula including the solubilized Keratin that relaxes your hair and it’s technically better at thickening and accelerating hair growth.</li>
    <li> This product has a remarkable effect on sustained hair growth and retention. As simple as taking another vitamin, and my hair has not only stopped receding, it has started to fill in. As a component of my regimen to minimize hair loss, I&#x27;ve found this product to be both easy to take and incredibly effective.</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this product to take each day while also using this brand’s (Ultrax Labs) shampoo. I posted a review on the shampoo, which I highly recommend, and I figured that I would also review this supplement. I am so happy with my purchase! I had experienced a thinning of my thick hair when I started using my hair straightener without using the proper protective spray. Eventually I was told to try Ultrax Labs products to help solve the problem. I noticed a difference in my hair in about a week and a half after starting this supplement. My hair started to become full again and I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I will definitely continue to use this supplement in the future. I am hoping that my hair can be fully restored to its gorgeous thickness that I loved. If you are looking for a supplement that is going to help restore your damaged or thinning hair then I highly recommend trying out this product.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs hair Rush has been effective and safe in the treatment for my hair loss. After 6 months I notice thickness in my hair and I stop losing hair</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle and I haven&#x27;t noticed a change at all in my hair or nails.  The product seems very expensive to keep trying.</li>
    <li> I started using this product 4 month back and my hair fall reduced drastically.&lt;br /&gt;In the beginning it made my hair fall slow down, then it stopped completely.Recently I observed&lt;br /&gt;new hair growth so I will continue using this product for next few months.</li>
    <li> This product really helps your hair grow! I cut my hair short a little while ago and I missed my longer hair, so I wanted to try this product! At first I was a little worried about hair growing other places besides my head, but that definitely does not happen!</li>
    <li> Tried it for 30 days but couldn&#x27;t see it changed much.  Quitting t-shots did though!</li>
    <li> Very good brand and it works perfectly. No complaints. Very good choice to buy and it does guarantee its work very well.</li>
    <li> Many products claim to be the better product but this one is it! After a months use there is a noticeable difference in thickness and health and a second month should do the trick. For best results I recommend this product! Thanks Ultrax!</li>
    <li> This vitamin worked better than i could have hoped. Much better than advertised and it definitely was a wonderful buy.</li>
    <li> I tried 2 bottles. It didn&#x27;t stop my hair loss. Nothing improved. Too expensive for a product that doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> Since is started growing my hair I noticed plenty of shedding so i found this to be an alternative. It helped to stop shedding hair. My hair is thicker and healthier than before. My hair is healthier and no hair loss!</li>
    <li> With all these positive reviews and that price that makes it look credible, I thought it would be the &amp;#34;miracle pills&amp;#34;, it turns out to be useless, possibly a scam. I finished 2 bottles now and there were no effects at all, in fact I noticed that I&#x27;ve lost more hair over the course of these two months (probably because I stopped using minoxidil), this product did nothing really, I would suggest minoxidil over this from experience, with minoxidil I used to see baby hairs at the temple areas but I didn&#x27;t know it was caused by minoxidil until I stopped using it. I&#x27;m switching back to minoxidil now.</li>
    <li> This is my first review ever.. And I am doing it because I am so upset about my situation getting worse..&lt;br /&gt;I only had receding hair line. Now, I can see the crown of my head. Do not buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;Try something else. This is not a fake review!!  I promise.</li>
    <li> member of the family swears by this product, and had been getting it from a local supplement store for almost $80/bottle. so happy to have found it on amazon for such great savings! has worked wonders for her hair and can&#x27;t stand the idea of living without it.</li>
    <li> This seems like a product I would suggest most people to use, this would be a wonderful item to use if you have a specific problem with hair loss.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these tablets for about two weeks and my hair already feels a bit better. I dye my hair quite a bit so  fall out and dullness was something I&#x27;d gotten used to but after about a week I noticed that my fallout was slowing and my hair looked a bit more shiny. I&#x27;d recommend trying at least two bottles just  to give your hair and body time to adjust and use what its been given.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve taken the time to read the poor reviews and most of them talk about not seeing any results at all. When using this product, please remember that this is about decreasing the amount of hair loss and strengthening your hair. You&#x27;re still going to lose hair. Its a natural part of life. The amount you lose will definitely decrease though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tablets are easy to swallow and dont leave an awful aftertaste which was another plus for me. I hate multi-vitimins for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with the Ultrax Caffeine Shampoo and have recommended both to several people who have had great results as well, after about a month. I will definitely be back for more!</li>
    <li> The Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx DHT dietary supplement pills work great. The pills glide down smooth and easy. I have been using this product for about 2 months now and I notice how thick and shinny my hair has been. There is less hair shedding. This product is great. Just two pills a day is making wonders for my hair. I am on my third bottle.</li>
    <li> Tried it for a month and have seen results! Have seen my hair become thicker as time passes. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> I switched from just taking biotin to taking Ultrax Labs and there has been a HUGE difference in the amount of hair I am losing. It must be the blend of ingredients instead of just straight Biotin. It used to feel like I was losing a handful of hair a day. It has been about a month since I started taking Ultrax and the shedding has decreased substantially, to the point that it isn&#x27;t even noticeable. On top of that, my hair definitely feels silkier, shinier, and all around healthier.  Anyone that has been having issues with shedding should definitely at least try it!</li>
    <li> I have to come back and re write review. after taking 3 bottles, no progress and was full refunded from the manuf website.  if youre shiny bald and want to regrow hair, goggle these big 3 three and see your doctor: minoxidil + finasteride + Nizoral.</li>
    <li> Do yourselves all a favor, look at all the 1 star reviews they are the only truthful ones here. Virtually none of the 5 star people that recommended it have been a &amp;#34;verified purchase.&amp;#34; I am glad that I read those before I bought this.</li>
    <li> A friend gave me a few bottles of this as a gift. I’ve been now using it for about two months, taking two capsules per day with meals as directed and I have noticed a substantial change in the fullness and thickness of my hair. Even more amazing; others have noticed the difference as well and this, to say the least, has boosted my confidence exponentially!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great thing is that the pills seem to contain natural vitamins and nutrients that have not caused any side-effects in me which is definitely a bonus. Overall I’m happy with the product and I am certainly going to recommend this to my balding friends!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not taking this product very long, just about a month but I have noticed less hair in the drain after taking a shower which is a big plus, every day I seemed to be losing more and more hair. In addition, my hair feels fuller and just looks healthier overall.  I looked at various other products that were similar but I kept coming back to this product because it not only has  Keratin but other essential vitamins, minerals and herbs and the positive  reviews for this product really sold me.  For best results they recommend you take it for a minimum of 90 days, but after 1 month I can already see a difference. I am very pleased with this product and would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I started using this product and two weeks later my shedding is not as much as before, 5 or 6 weeks later I can see tiny new hairs in my front line when before I could see the scalp I was very worry about it but now I am happy that I found a product that I can trust and use .. I also notice that my nails are stronger before they used to break easily but not anymore now I can say I have nails... I will recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I had hair loss for months (middle age) and this product has mitigated the loss by 90%.</li>
    <li> I going to buy another bottle and try one month more. I have seen a slight improvement, so time will tell.</li>
    <li> Wow unbelievable!  Great for me</li>
    <li> I have noticed a definite increase in hair growth and well as less hair falling out.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for those changes in their hair growth and/or loss and looking for a natural product.</li>
    <li> I have been taking this product for one month and just bought a second bottle only because maybe my hair needs more time to react to the vitamins in this product.  This product was delivered within the time frame  but the first bottle did not contain 60 tablets and the second contained even less. My hair is still breaking and getting thinner and no new growth.  If nothing changes this will be the last bottle I purchase.</li>
    <li> WORKS BETTER THAN EXPECTED.... WELL WORTH THE COST!!!</li>
    <li> The product works!  Since the company offers a 100% money back guarantee, I figured - why not give it a shot?! I didn&#x27;t see growth right away - you do have to be patient, hair takes a little while to grow! In my opinion, it&#x27;s worth trying. I&#x27;d rather try something than lose my hair!</li>
    <li> Along with my &amp;#34;newfound love &amp;#34; of Ultrax Labs Hair restorative products; Beauty comes from &amp;#34;within&amp;#34;. Your hair says it all... The Ultrax Labs not only have concocted the hair treatments to enable hair regrowth; but know their respective products will go &amp;#34;the extra mile&amp;#34; if the consumer should add the key vitamins such as Keratin, Biotin, and Magnesium to promote &amp; stimulate hair, skin, nail growth which stems from a healthier circulatory/digestive system targeted to make it all work! I get nauseated thinking about taking each tab separately--ughh. So far it&#x27;s the multi purpose in one shot! Yay! My insides are better, my hair, face, &amp; nails have significantly become strenghened &amp; luminous! One a day is all you need!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for thinning hair.  After a few weeks of taking it the hair that was falling out stopped.  There was also new hair growth.  I am happy to see that my hair has stopped falling out.  This product is packed with vitamins to improve hair growth.  Hair is healthier, stronger and thicker.</li>
    <li> I have been using Hair Maxx for a couple months now and I am happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair growth has improved and my hair is thicker. My hair does not shed as much as before and that makes me happy. I can run my hand through my hair and it feels thicker, fuller and stronger with less shedding. I am happy with my results and will continue to keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results it says to take for 90 days, 2 times a day with food. And be sure to store it in a cool, dry place. Hair Maxx is also safe for both men and women, but of course keep it away from children.</li>
    <li> This formula really handles everything.  Like their shampoo that addresses mostly external causes of thinning hair and hair loss, this supplement really goes the extra mile to support healthy hair growth and healthy follicles  from the inside out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it&#x27;s important to note the nutrient complex in this supplement.  Beyond factors such as stress and hormones such as DHT, many people don&#x27;t automatically think that their hair issues can be attributed to nutrient deficiency.  There is even more confusion regarding this topic in industrialized nations due to the abundance of food.  In spite of that, it is quite easy to fall short in certain nutrients and Ultrax Labs seeks to remedy that with this vitamin complex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nutrients such as zinc are known to nourish follicles and maintain follicle health, while biotin is a real hair growth booster.  Other vitamins such as C and D contribute to a healthy scalp and hair.  Iodine is mostly known for supporting a healthy thyroid, but what some may not know is that one of the most obvious symptoms of hypothyroidism is hair loss and thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To support scalp health and hair growth further, Ultrax Labs utilizes a blend to stimulate hair growth once its supported by the other nutrients in the complex.  Herbs such as nettle and saw palmetto block DHT production.  On top of that, this supplement has soluble keratin in it, a crucial building block of hair. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing the results from this combined with the shampoo.</li>
    <li> After 1 bottle no change.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx DHT Blocking Hair Loss -  works magic and the ingredients in it are the key to a healthy head of hair and it&#x27;s the key solution you need  you have to keep up with taking  the vitamins.  You will see the results  I will recommend it to people who are serious about getting the hair back on track</li>
    <li> Hair Maxx supplement contains more than 20 essential minerals, vitamins and herbs combined to invigorate hair follicles and spur faster growth.  A key ingredient is keratin, a protein found naturally in hair, skin and nails. The vitamin restores and boosts levels of keratin, which is known to strengthen hair and maintain its elasticity. Therefore this product is well need of your hair is starting or has thinning for a long time now.</li>
    <li> Only been using this product for about a month, but I noticed a HUGE difference in my hair!! It stopped falling out in chunks, seems softer and fuller. I have taken other hair loss products and nothing has worked as efficiently and quickly as this. I&#x27;ve always had thin damaged hair, this actually thickened my hair and helped bring back that shiny look. Ordering my second bottle, and I plan to keep using it as long as my hair needs!! You want something that actually works?? Then you definitely want this stuff.</li>
    <li> These vitamins work really good.  I started taking these earlier this month. I immediately began seeing dramatic results.  My hair has been growing like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;  My hair texture has improved also, it&#x27;s getting thicker and strengthening.  I can see taking these pills for a long coarse of time. with no problem.  By next year I could have hair like Rapunzel. They are really good.  I would recommend them to any one with any hair growth problems or who would just prefer longer hair or would like their hair to grow at all for any reason. I think they are especially good for strengthening hair that is what I noticed first of the vitamins. I am getting a really nice texture I am very satisfied with.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I really like them, they work good. They are also conveniant to use. The longer you use them the better the results...</li>
    <li> I prefer to try and grow my hair using a pill over shampoo any day, the pill just seems more realistic. I have a problem with my hair thinning in the front and this pill with keratin has helped significantly, I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks. It&#x27;s not nasty and totally tolerable and actually works, very well worth the price for the outcome :)</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and I&#x27;m happy to find it once again. I noticed soon after I stopped taking Hair Maxx I had a lot more hair in the bottom of the shower and in my comb.  I am looking forward to fuller hair again now that I have Hair Maxx again.  You only need to take 2 capsules a day!</li>
    <li> Impressed with results! Paired with the Surge Shampoo and I have little to no hair shedding.  I recommended Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx to anyone experiencing major hair shedding. Plus it is made in the USA!!</li>
    <li> I started noticing everytime i comb my hair. My brush would  have a plenty of haor. It started getting worse because i notice my hair balls were getting a bit bigger.I tried eating fruits and vegetables to regain my vitamins. I got irrated and decided to look online for a product. Reading the reviews made me believe i wasnt the only one with this issue.  I saw results in a very fast matter. My hair is strong and no hair comes out when im brushing it.</li>
    <li> I have only used one bottle so far but didnt notice much differnce.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these vitamins for several months and was thrilled to find them on Amazon for a cheaper price. I&#x27;m not going bald, but I&#x27;ve been wanting thicker hair that doesn&#x27;t shed as much. I use the Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx DHT blocking hair loss supplement along with a shampoo designed to reduce shedding and regrow hair and I definitely notice less hair in my brush after brushing my hair and less coming out in the shower. It helps your hair from the inside out, by giving you vitamins and nutrients you&#x27;re likely missing in your diet.</li>
    <li> Product works great for my hair loss, my hair is thicker and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll give it zero stars if i could.  It&#x27;s expensive and useless.  The tablets are small, only occupy about 1/4 of the bottle, so there&#x27;s a big piece of cotton in the bottle to keep the tablets from sloshing around.  It seems the maker deliberatly use a big bottle to make the buyer think there&#x27;s a lot stuff in there.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe there 300+ 5 star reviews, the are mostly fake, i believe. Just look at the ingredients, it&#x27;s the same old stuff you that have been &#x27;claimed&#x27; to be good for hair, saw palmetto, nettle, biotinc, zinc.</li>
    <li> Hair Maxx not only prevents hair loss but also increases hair growth and thickness. Not only the product worked wonders on the hair, my finger nails are stronger and I have more energy. If want to have an amazing results, I strongly recommend Hair Maxx</li>
    <li> I am not a huge fan on taking pills and I have tried several products that claim hair growth. Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx is actually a good product. It has over 23 vitamins, which help my hair keep its luster and moisture, naturally. The only set back is an upset stomach if you don&#x27;t eat a light meal or snack before you take it. A banana helps to settle this or yogurt. The price is good for a 30 day supply. I have recommended this product to a few friends, who seem to be happy also.</li>
    <li> At 48 years old, this totally helped my hair appearance. Head and especially beard look full and awesome now.</li>
    <li> Its only been a month and I can see results already! There is hope out there!! After years of suffering from lots and lots of hair loss every time I wash or brush my hair I finally see it getting better. I have seen a significant change in my hair for the better!. It also feels thicker and it has grown some as well. Great product I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from hair fall since I gave birth to my first child. My hair just fell easily whenever I took shower and comb my hair. I was so embarrassed about it. I saw this products here in amazon but at first I had doubt of buying this but  since the reviews were good so I gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;After 6 weeks of continue using this product, I noticed less hair fall and so happy with the progress. I have a positive  view that this will continue to help my hair  from falling and gives me a healthy beautiful hair. I will never regret of trying this hair product!</li>
    <li> Since taking this product I believe I have noticed less shedding and hair loss.  However, I am using this in conjunction with a laser comb.  I am impressed enough with the results that I have ordered another bottle and will continue to use it for a few months.  I did not lose my hair overnight, and I won&#x27;t grow it back overnight.  I say this product is worth trying if you are losing your hair.  I&#x27;m glad I am taking a proactive step.  Good luck to all.  I am feeling cautiously encouraged.</li>
    <li> I had to give these pill a try. I am really impressed in how fast it works. I used to have thinning hair were my glasses rubbed just above my ears, but within a month I started growing little baby hairs and now my hair line is completely full.</li>
    <li> Really excited about this supplement because it&#x27;s actually working. I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in my hair growth and overall health. I&#x27;ve had friends and family who have recommended Ultrax products to me so I&#x27;ll definitely be trying some others as well.</li>
    <li> Did not do anything for my hair. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> been using for over 3 months with no real results to speak of.</li>
    <li> I have tried many hair loss products and this one tops them all. My hair is thick, healthy, shiny, thick, full. I am sold and will buy it always. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Awesome product after using for a month I noticed a difference. Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> This is a great supplement, they say it starts from within and taking this is what you need to get growth started from the inside out, contains the supplement Keratin which strengthens hair and helps it thicken, so it grows fuller and makes you happier as your head is covered with strong thick hair and it will all start with taking this product, get yours today, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> When you&#x27;re middle-aged you definitely lose hair. It&#x27;s a fact of aging. I noticed my husband losing some hair and he wasn&#x27;t handling it well. He is vain and I had to help him do something about the hair loss. It was starting to affect his self-esteem.I decided to order Hair Maxx after doing some careful research about hair loss and DHT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took about three months but it started to really make a difference in his hair growth. All those patchy spots seemed to be slowly growing in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first he was very skeptical when I gave him the supplement. I assured him it was 100% safe (I did lots of research to verify this). He really was expecting it NOT to work. He was very pleasantly surprised with the results. We are definitely going to keep buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend it to anyone starting to notice hair loss. He is definitely more confident with the improvement in his hair.</li>
    <li> I have tried one product from this line, along with this product and they have both proven to be amazing. They work very well, and I still cannot believe the improvement to my hair, the growth, and the fullness that I continue to receive. I absolutely love the products and I will continue to used them, I have yet to have any breakage, or problems with my hair since I&#x27;ve started to use the products. It keeps in the moisture, conceals the use of the products and leaves my hair feeling full, soft, and amazing after each use. I recommend everyone to try this product, the difference from other, more expensive products is shown, and you can never go wrong.</li>
    <li> Ultralax Labs creates superior products that fight hair loss and enhance the overall appearance and health. I use another of its products and found it so effective that I tried this product. In addition, I recently purchased the shampoo. This DHT growth nutrient and blocker is as amazing as the other Ultralax products! My hair shedding has stopped and there is a noticeable improvement in its look and feel. I strongly recommend the product and believe it will benefit anyone who suffers from hair loss. I will continue to use and also to try other Ultralax Labs products. It has rapidly become a trusted brand for me.</li>
    <li> When I began taking this medication I was losing a lot of hair and the texture of my hair was very dry with split ends. After 3 weeks on this medication I started noticing a major change with my hair. This supplement has accelerated my hair growth, decrease significally my hair loss and have provide more of a thick texture to my hair. This supplement is definitely a hair growth miracle in a bottle its ingredients provide your hair with all the nourishment it requires as well as the benefits. I will recommend this supplement to anyone who wants to have long, strong, healthy and beautiful hair!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly as the reviews before me have stated - somehow this works.  It took a few weeks to see the difference, but there is a marked change in how much hair is coming out when I brush or shower, and I no longer have giant fist fulls of shedding hair.  Amazing!  Will continue...</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product even for people who don&#x27;t have hair loss problem. I have  very long hair and after Hair Max my hair got shinier and stronger, a bit more long and definatly  healthier. I also noticed that my nails got stronger, as well.</li>
    <li> 5STARS One of the best products out to date and thats a promise. Going through product after product i finally stumbled upon a supplement that actually does as Described. Using this product gave my hair a shinier apperance instead of its usual dull looking appearance, added thickness to my hair that I lost as i grew and continue to grow older, The amount of hair-loss Ive been experiencing has been brought to minimum, Hair line has come back to former glory. It Has essential vitamins needed for encouraging your hair to grow and it targets what causing your hair loss. Bald spots filled in after a few months. Family and friends always notice the improvement of my hair, and people who don&#x27;t know me also complement my hair. I ask people my age and i get one thats usually in the range of 5-10 years younger than I actually am. Overall love the product YMMV if you&#x27;re skeptic like most people including myself its worth giving this supplement a chance.</li>
    <li> These supplements are not exactly cheap, but you do begin noticing results in about a month, so long as you follow the instructions on the package. There&#x27;s no such thing as a &amp;#34;miracle cure&amp;#34; for hair loss, but this product comes pretty close. I noticed my roots were looking healthier and my shedding in the shower has dramatically reduced since I started taking these a month ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not already taking vitamin and mineral tablets, this product also contains quite a few supplements that supplement (for lack of a better word) the nutrients you get in your diet, possibly having positive effects beyond improving your hair. I definitely recommend these supplements as a hair loss solution, and I&#x27;m purchasing these again to make sure that the improvement continues.</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical because I feel that there is no product out there that would help with my hair loss, but this product has shown proven results and the spots where it was thinning and falling out are growing back strong.</li>
    <li> i couldn&#x27;t believe it i used the pills for a month my hair started to grow back where it was missing. my hair is thicker and stronger now too. when i comb my hair hardly any hair comes out now this product plus it works great with all the product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 months, and my hair has grown tremendously. My friends and family even notice the difference.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a change at all. Appears to be a lot of fake reviews.</li>
    <li> This product is worth the money. If you follow the directions this product works. I don&#x27;t have to worry about buying any other hair growth product!</li>
    <li> In order to help my hair grow, I realized that i needed to take something orally to help work from within. It wasn&#x27;t rocket science that Ultra Labs Hair Maxxs DHT.. would be my best choice. Where else are u going to find a hair supplement that has active ingredients that block DHT, a hormone relation of hair loss. My skin didnt break out like hair supplements from my past experience. Ultra Labs Supplement doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is stronger, less shedding,fuller, and noticeably growing. I will say that I&#x27;ve experienced my scalp itching. Itching never felt so great. Its a known fact itching of the scalp is a result from your hair growing.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t pluck your brain, Or hair trying to find a hair supplement that works. Try Ultra Labs u&#x27;ll be satisfied :)</li>
    <li> Works surprisingly fast, this product is much better then rogaine! This is my 2nd time purchasing this and will not be my last! I am really amazed how great it also works with ultrax labs stimulating shampoo</li>
    <li> After giving birth to my twins my hair was literally coming out by the handfuls. I took vitamins, used creams and all types of concoctions that failed me miserably. Hair Maxx restored my hair in less than 3 months time and I am ecstatic about it. Areas that were slow growing before have thickened up and now I am able to achieve and maintain a lot more length. This supplements tackles your hair growth issues from within the follicle and that gets to the root of the problem. Highly recommended, Excellent Product!</li>
    <li> This supplement has helped my thinning hair tremendously for the past three months. I was looking for a supplement like this for ages to help me grow my hair and get it back to its original health. My hair has grown longer,  thicker and I have lost all split ends. My hair has never felt this healthy and amazing before. Amazing supplement!!</li>
    <li> I like Hair Maxx supplements, because they contain vitamins, minerals, and herbs, not only to achieve healthy hair, but also nutrients needed for the body. Men and women can use these supplements. This product is effective and works as advertised. It has been about 2 weeks since my dad started taking this and his hair has stopped falling out as much and new hair has started to grow near his forehead. His finger nails are starting to grow stronger be more durable when he works around the house. It is very easy to use and only requires a little patience. This is one of the only products that has worked for my dad and caused no irritation or effects. The price can&#x27;t be beat as other sites have it for $20 more and its quality is impressive. The shipping was fast, came in the day it said it would. I would definitely recommend it to anyone having balding problem or simply just want to grow fuller healthier hair.</li>
    <li> Man... this stuff works. I used to take biotin alone and never saw a distinct difference in the texture of my hair. Well now I&#x27;ve noticed it looks thicker and shinier without altering anything else in my haircare routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is pretty large relative to the number of pills you get. But that&#x27;s ok. It&#x27;s worth it anyway.</li>
    <li> Let me tell you that this product does work! I have been taking it for three weeks now and my hair is thicker and is more shiny! Try this with a good conditioner and you&#x27;ll see a improvement!</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Max DHT BLOCKING hair loss hair growth vitamins are great for strengthening the hair, helping with circulation and aiding in growth for the hair. Contains keratin to help keep hair strong. It can help stop hair loss and provide nutrients to your body, which is essential for healthy hair and healthy growth! Ultrax also has other products that are great for hair strength, preventing hair loss, and thickening hair. I have personally seen results in my hair!</li>
    <li> Incredible and very reasonable price for a product that actually works! Less pesky than a spray and takes no time at all to start working. Impossible not be say satisfied.</li>
    <li> Wow. Love this product! I have been taking it for a little over a week and I can already see the difference in my hair (and nails)! My hair was thinning and dull, but this product totally turned it around - my hair is looking and feeling fuller, and I have no more split ends. So glad I tried this product out. I will definitely buy this product again!</li>
    <li> Product works real good.... Haven&#x27;t had any issues with my hair lately.</li>
    <li> This slows down hair loss after a month! Wow! Definitely getting more!</li>
    <li> When reviewing the ingredients of Hair Maxx, I was immediately impressed! Many other hair growth products only contain Biotin, but Ultra Labs includes additional vitamins that prove very helpful to my hair! 60 tablets is quite a deal at this price point as well! Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I am not a scientist, so I don&#x27;t even pretend to know why this works, but it totally does.  My hair has stopped shedding by the handful...and seems to be getting thicker.  I don&#x27;t really care if this is even a trick played on me by my mind...It makes me happy!  I don&#x27;t feel so old.  I totally recommend this supplement.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle product!  Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx formula includes over twenty essential vitamins, minerals and herbs; which combine to form a powerhouse of hair loss prevention and growth acceleration.  The Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx supplement blocks DHT production, which is what causes hair to fall out of the follicle.  Saw palmetto blocks the 5 alpha reductase enzyme, which facilitates the change of testosterone into DHT.  Nettle leaf powder blocks DHT directly.  This two-pronged approach to blocking DHT with saw palmetto and nettle leaf powder is what makes Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx so effective.  In addition to saw palmetto and nettle leaf powder, the Hair Maxx formula includes solubilized keratin which accelerates hair growth, increases hair thickness, and decreases hair loss.  Hair Maxx also includes pumpkin seed powder to promote faster and healthier hair growth; as well as biotin, zinc, vitamin B6, and magnesium, which are follicle boosters.  Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx is highly effective for both men and women, and there are no side effects.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with baldness or thinning hair.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product and leaves my hair looking fuller and healthier. I am really pleased with the results from Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx. I have been made a believer of this product, My hair has never looked better.</li>
    <li> This is amazing and it really works! I&#x27;ve been taking this supplement in addition to the caffeine hair growth stimulating shampoo and I highly recommend this combination.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, but definitely worth it for me! This is perfect for anyone that is experiencing thinning hair or total hair loss. Try it out!</li>
    <li> I used to have hair fall  whenever i took shower or when i used to comb my hair. Because of this problem i restricted myself shampooing only twice a month. My friend who had the same problem as me referred it to me and I just  started using this product 3 months ago and i can already see the difference. Money cant buy happiness but i&#x27;d say this indeed does! I happy to have found an awesome product like ultra labs hair maxx dht. Highly recommend for people having hair loss!</li>
    <li> I was a bit nervous when purchasing this but the price is more reasonable than some products out there which was one of the deciding factors for me. The reviews I have read here on Amazon as well as online have been great. If you want to stop your hair from thinning and want thicker hair, then this formula would be great for you. The essential vitamins aid in circulation and increase hair growth in a safe and effective way, no upset tummy here, unlike some other products I&#x27;ve read about, it also seems to be helping my nails and skin (probably the vitamin E). Male or female this formula seems perfect for anyone looking to improve the quality of their hair or increase the growth of their hair. Definitely worth the buy!</li>
    <li> I really dislike taking pills but having a head full of hair makes popping them worth it! It&#x27;s been a couple of weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed a clear change in the growth of my hair. Of course it hasn&#x27;t happened overnight but I&#x27;m satisfied with the growth so far. I&#x27;ve also been using their shampoo to which I believe has been working wonders too. I&#x27;m also very pleased with the amount that&#x27;s given too. There is exactly enough to last a month so you&#x27;re not being ripped off. However, I must stress this isn&#x27;t a one time thing - this is a commitment. If you want to keep having hair you have to keep taking the pills or else all the results will be wasted. Personally, this is the best hair growth product that I&#x27;ve used that actually works while also being reasonable priced which is why I believe the trade-off is certainly worth it!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking to increase your hair growth for fuller and stronger hair this product is for you.  I&#x27;ve noticed many new baby hairs as well as less shedding when brushing my hair.  Hair feels thicker and stronger after a few weeks of use already!</li>
    <li> For years I have been looking for a product that would help reduce the amount of hair that I lose on a daily basis. I have just started month three of this product and the results are wonderful. I use to have to sweep my floors daily and unclog my shower drain every 4 weeks due to the amount of hair loss that I was experiencing. Into month two I noticed that I was getting less hair on the floor and in my brush and I haven&#x27;t had to unclog my shower drain yet. My fiance noticed the difference in my hair and is starting month two himself. He and I are noticing the small thinning spot on the top of his head is starting to thicken up. I am betting that after using this product for another month I will have to visit my stylist more often seeing as my hair is growing faster than normal and I don&#x27;t see being able to wait 6 weeks for a hair cut. :) This product is that good and is now a necessity for me and my fiance. :)</li>
    <li> My hair got worse after taking this.</li>
    <li> This product is very good it promotes and increases hair growth and thickness and it has 23 different essential vitamins necessary to help your hair.</li>
    <li> Hair breakage has reduced. My hair is softer and fuller. I will definitely keep taking this product.</li>
    <li> This hair loss supplement personally helps my hair stay growing and just how I want my hair to be. I am happy with my hair and love this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Hair Maxx Ultrax Labs tablets for a few weeks now, and I must say I have seen a big enough difference to want to order another bottle before I finish these. Hair Maxx by Ultra Labs is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for to get my hair to stop shedding I also like the fact that the ingredients are natural. It has vitamins, minerals and herbs that will help my hair stop shedding and look healthier.Best of all they are affordable and works with my budget. I would definitely recommend this product for anyone with, hair growth and thinning problems.</li>
    <li> I believe this to be a great enhancement to the Ultra Labs shampoo Hair Surge. Using both products in conjunction helps the strengthening process and gives your hair the vitamins and nutrients it needs to be healthy. Also the keratin being in this product puts my mind at ease knowing time was taken to give this product in comparison to others on the market the best nutrients.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. There was a sufficient result time for growth and thickness from these tablets. Most don&#x27;t stand up to these tablets and could never in the future. One could say these were very magical. Hair couldn&#x27;t be more bouncy and thick.  This all as a result of this product,. Not sure if you should get it?....I&#x27;m telling you now. get it!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me at all</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I have been losing hair for some time (at the end of a shower, while combing hair, when I run my fingers through my hair) so I was willing to try anything.  A friend told me about this and IT WORKS!  I have been using it for a month now and I have stopped losing hair.  I am excited. Basically, you take two pills a day, filled with vitamins, and stop worrying about hair loss.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! This company makes the best products for hair loss. I will continue to buy this for my husband and myself in the future!</li>
    <li> helps to reduce hair loss, but you have to use at least 3-4 months to see a result.</li>
    <li> This product is really working! I have less breakage and more volume. I notice a lot less hair in my hairbrush. This product contains keratin which is noted to promote hair growth. I take the recommended two pills a day in the morning. I am hyper-aware of the amount of shedding that ends up in my hairbrush and it has decreased substantially. It makes sense to me to take a supplement in addition to the shampoos and conditioners I use. Using them together has achieved the results I have been looking for.</li>
    <li> started noticing some premature hair loss happening used this product it is no longer an issue. Idk how it works but it is amazing and I have no complaints highly recommend.</li>
    <li> GREAT! works just like they say, hair is coming in, in the thin areas, slowly but surely.  Just bought more.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It works incredibly well. Ultrax Labs really does have hair growth down to an art between this and their other products.  I never thought I&#x27;d see the island on the top of my head growing larger become smaller, but it has. Since I&#x27;ve started using this, my hair is stronger, thicker, and I have new hair growing where I thought I&#x27;d never see hair grow again, and it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> This stuff works! Have seen major improvement in hair growth. Felt like I was balding in the back of my head, used Hair Rush for a few weeks and have seen improvement. Will definitely recommend this product to all my friends!</li>
    <li> My hair has grown down to my waist. Helps your hair grow fast. Am extremely satisfied by the fast results.</li>
    <li> This supplement has all the vitamins essential for supplementing hair growth and overall health and beauty (bonus: many are also great for your skin). The price may seem like a lot at first glance, but really, if you itemize the different supplements, you are saving money. If bought separately, not only is it more expensive, but it is more cumbersome and time-consuming ingesting all of those pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I am happy with the product and am looking forward to seeing changes with consistent, long-term use--I have also recently tried the Ultrax Labs Caffeine Shampoo in hopes of doubling up on the effects of both products. *Fingers crossed*</li>
    <li> Hair Maxx not only prevents hair loss but also it also increases hair growth and thickness. This product is perfect for people with any type of hair facing hair losing problems. Even if you don&#x27;t have problems with your hair it would help you to have a hair you can be proud because this product gives more life to your hair. It is easy to intake only two small tablets with the meals. If you want to have an amazing hair I strongly recommend Hair Maxx.</li>
    <li> I used this product for 4 months and found no noticeable results (just a significantly lighter wallet). I am usually not one to question the validity of reviews, but I am very skeptical of the number of 5 star reviews. Just wanted to share my experience. Cheers</li>
    <li> Excellent product! My husband has been using this consistently for 3 months now and we have definitely noticed a difference in his hair! His hair has gotten thicker and looks much healthier. I&#x27;ve noticed newer hair come in also. So happy with this product, we will certainly continue using this!</li>
    <li> I have a receding hairline and wear a hat everyday because I work in the sun. I started losing a lot of my hair on top of my already receding hairline and started to panic. I searched for something that could keep me from losing anymore hair and found all the great reviews here on this product so I bought it and started using it two weeks ago, and I am so glad I did. I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in my daily hair loss, no new hair yet but I am really happy with the results so far. Looking forward to new hair growth soon!</li>
    <li> If you have thin hair and want to thicken your hair i suggest you buy this product. These vitamins work great i love it, just take 2 everyday and watch your hair grow and get thicker, Mine did!</li>
    <li> I was experiencing thinning of my hair and now my hair looks fuller and generally better. Kudos to the makers of this product. I definitely recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Needless to say a receding hair line and thinning hair has been a part of my family for generations.  I&#x27;ve used the product for a month and to their credit I am pleasantly surprised.  With a plethora of hair growth, and/or expensive clubs out in the marketplace claiming to end male pattern baldness or hair loss,  I definitely give this product a thumbs up.  Within a couple of weeks, I wasn&#x27;t losing any more hair and by the fourth week I noticed my hair was getting thicker.  If you are looking for a cost effective alternative to prevent hair loss then this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> I will not be buying another one. This has done nothing for me after several months of using. I trusted all the reviews and I think they paid them to do positive reviews. I highly regret wasting hundreds of dollars on this s***ty product</li>
    <li> I checked the website out and this product has 4 1/2 stars on its website here&#x27;s the link http://ultraxlabs.com/products/hair_maxx . Based on the reviews on the website people claim that it does take time give or take 2 to 3 weeks to see results as to growing out &amp;#34;baby hair&amp;#34; . I say this product is something you should try for hair growth , it doesn&#x27;t have 4 1/2 stars for nothing!</li>
    <li> First I would like to say that I am on my third bottle. If you are like me, and you take your hair loss seriously, you will do your research. I did mine before I ordering Hair Maxx . My research said over and over that some of the ingredients in Hair Maxx are ultimate, like  the soluble keratin which is an active ingredient in here. Can I guarantee that it will work for you as it did for me in this review? No, I cannot. But this worked for me and maybe because it is because of my set of biological conditions, maybe the product is just that good. But if you are like me and you take your hair loss seriously, do your research and then buy it. Try it. Maybe you are like me and it will work, but you will not know until you try. I did, and now I am on my third bottle. There are many reviews on here that say a lot. I did my research, it works for me.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders.  I believe anyone should give it a try.</li>
    <li> When my hair started thinning on the top of my head (it&#x27;s hereditary), I was considering all different types of products, both medication and herbal.  To my relief, my doctor said that this product is safe.  Given that I am a vegan and really conscious of what goes in my body this was a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two months of taking the pills, my hair has regained some of its thickness.  And I&#x27;m not afraid to comb through it anymore for fear of losing hair!  I also have to say that my nails are thicker and skin looks more healthy than before.  Definitely looking forward to seeing the results six months in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend giving this product a try!</li>
    <li> This is my first time buying pills (or any other treatment for that matter) this expensive for my hair loss and I have to say, you get what you pay for. In the first few weeks I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference but my wife started commenting that my hair looked thicker and then I started to notice a lot less hairs in my brush at the end of the week. By the second or third month I started noticing patches of hair growth where there was none before and my existing hair looked much thicker and fuller. I&#x27;m going to continue ordering the product for the next several months as I&#x27;ve been very happy with the results I&#x27;ve been getting so far! 5-Star!</li>
    <li> This does nothing for male pattern baldness. After three months, absolutely no difference what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read recently that Amazon has sued few companies that write fake reviews here - this product definitely looks like it falls in the category for paid fake reviews (just my guess). Over the years, Amazon reviews were my go-to for buying anything new. But slowly my overall confidence is eroding over these reviews. Companies these days can seemingly easily buy fake reviews and rob us customers of our hard earned money. Well, shame on me for trusting reviews here, at-least this experience has taught me to do more research than blindly trust reviews.</li>
    <li> I cannot imagine why someone would not use this product. I had been using Biotin supplements which I am not even sure worked. This has so many other added vitamins and minerals it doesn&#x27;t make sense to try anything else for hair strength and growth.</li>
    <li> The product is really good for hair growth. instead of putting product in your hair you just have to take a pill. Much better for me</li>
    <li> I have been taking this for the past few weeks and I can already tell the difference in seeing more baby hairs growing daily. I went to get my hair cut the other day and my hair stylist asked me what I was doing differently because she could tell the texture was getting thicker as well. I used to lose a handful of hair each time I showered and it is definitely less than it used to be. Waiting for even greater results in the weeks to come.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that I have lost faith in all hair loss/hair growth products UNTIL I tried the Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx DHT Blocking Hair Loss Hair Growth Nutrient Solubilized Keratin Vitamin Supplement - with this product my faith in hair loss/hair growth products has been restored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been in the process of losing my hair since my early twenties, due to the daily abuse that I put it through, from chemically treating it to regularly straightening it to even gluing hair extensions in my hair and losing an enormous amount of hair when I took them out. However, the straw that broke the camel&#x27;s back with my hair loss was my pregnancy - after having a child I couldn&#x27;t even wear my hair down because running my fingers through my hair would cause me to lose about 15 hairs every time. I would be mortified when I had to wash my hair because the amount of hair that was in the tub was probably enough to make a wig out of it. My hair was literally shedding EVERYWHERE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for approximately a week now and I can already see results! Ever since I began using this product my hair feels thicker and fuller. In addition, this product has accelerated my hair growth... I can see baby hairs beginning to grow around my hairline. Furthermore, when I go shower now or brush my hair I notice a considerably less amount of hair falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other vitamin supplements I&#x27;ve taken, this product gives your hair a boost from the inside out whereas other products only work from the outside. In addition, what I liked about this product was that it&#x27;s very simple to take, all you need to do is take 2 capsules a day. On the other hand, other products that I&#x27;ve tried for hair loss/hair growth require much more time, such as hair loss shampoos and kits. Also compared to other products that only take a biotin supplement and add one or two ingredients, this product consists of over 20 essential vitamins, minerals and herbs. Finally, the price is comparable to other products, if not cheaper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this product, which is completely safe to use, and I don&#x27;t even have 1 bad thing to say about it. This product helped me save my hair and I will continue using it and recommending it to others!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything for my hair. .... considering I&#x27;m only 28 and I feel like I shed tremendously (and each year my hair seems to thin more and more). My mom has hypothyroidism and she&#x27;s (a nurse) and is pretty sure I do as well. I just started taking this, but there was almost no hair in the shower the last few days--usually there&#x27;s a giant glob I have to pull out each time :( So that alone is really exciting. I&#x27;m hoping to see those baby hairs come in in a few months! I&#x27;ll update if I do!</li>
    <li> Decided to give another Ultrax product a go...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using these in conjunction with my biotin vitamins and loving the result. My hair is feeling great both curly and straight. The texture feels great after all the wear and tear from heat products. Hoping these will be good with the colder weather coming as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy with my Ultrax shampoo as well, great combo, recommend buying together.</li>
    <li> After purchasing the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge with great delight, the following Hair Maxx DHT Blocking Growth Nutrient manufactured by the same company seemed like a natural complement to the already positive affects of the shampoo.  It made sense to me that a vitamin supplement would double the affects and combat the embarrassing signs of hair loss.  Containing a soluble Keratin ingredient which increases hair growth and thickness, this particular products blocks the production of DHT and helps to regrow hair by further supplying and circulating the body with 23 additional vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having relied on the medical advice of a Naturopathic doctor for years, I know the wonders that specific supplements like these can have not only on hair, but also on procuring stronger nails and skin.</li>
    <li> i love it my hair become good .no loss</li>
    <li> When I was pregnant, my hair was so thick, shiny, and grew longer than it had ever been before.  Shortly after my son was born, my hair started to get brittle and thin.  It was breaking off badly and coming out in my hairbrush.  I tried this because it has so many vitamins, and has keratin!  WIthin a few weeks of use my hair started to look stronger, and stop falling out so much.  I&#x27;m looking forward to continuing to see if the reversal will continue!  My hair is almost as beautiful as it was when I was pregnant!  I had no side effects and it less expenive than some of the other Hair Growth Products, and no Monthly Charge.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so easy to take a vitamin supplement. What&#x27;s even better is taking a daily vitamin and then actually seeing results. Everything you need is in one small capsule! Cheers to thicker hair the natural way!</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from gradual hair loss for years and tried a number of homemade remedies as well as prescriptions. I was at the point of resigning to the fact that nothing could be done when someone recommended Hair Maxx. I was skeptical, but decided to try it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a shock when I started to see real results within the first month. I have already placed another order, as I don’t want to run out. I have been wearing hot, uncomfortable wigs when going out, and for the first time in years, I went out without my wig OR a hat. I am so thrilled that I am encouraging my sister, who has also struggled with hair loss, to try Hair Maxx. The only thing better than finding a product that really works is being able to share it with someone else who is desperate for a solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for developing a quality product that is changing lives!</li>
    <li> This product works great! It really helps to improve hair loss. I love the results.</li>
    <li> This product has been amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Has created new hair growth faster than expected!  Plan to re-order this,  I recommend it to anyone that wants new growth!</li>
    <li> Great for hair loss and thinning! As with anything, results take a few weeks (hair has to grow!) to notice. My shedding has stopped and I&#x27;ve got little baby hairs growing.</li>
    <li> I REALLY like these pills !! :-) I started taking it two weeks after I began using the shampoo !! It&#x27;s only been a month but I&#x27;m EXTREMELY excited with the results so far ! I started using it after my hair started coming out after a chemical process gone bad. :-( but my hair stooped shedding and hopefully it&#x27;ll get thick again soon !!! :-)</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my barber a while ago, but I never gave it a second thought. I had been losing my hairline slowely for last 5 years. Until recently it seemed to just start receding faster than ever. This scared me just enough to do something about it. I tried a couple different supplements and shampoos, but none had such an immediate effect. Just a few weeks into using it and my hair feels stronger and more dense, especially when wet. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was just me, then my barber asked me if I was using something, without me mentioning it. So then I knew. It&#x27;s definitely worth the investment. I will be getting more.</li>
    <li> This works great in conjunction with the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo (Health and Beauty) for thinning hair and I really like the 20 essential vitamins, minerals and herbs in this product. I would definitely use these together to combat the loss of hair and excessive shedding.</li>
    <li> This stuff works really well, I saw results in just a few weeks.  It only helps hair grow in the place you want it, not the other places you don&#x27;t.  I will continue to buy this product as it has helped me get the look I wanted.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is so easy to use.  Just take two pills and watch your hair get healhier and thicker!!!!  Great idea for hair improvement with no mess.</li>
    <li> Ive been using generic Biotin capsules for a while now.&lt;br /&gt;Ultrax Labs combination actually absorbs better in my hair, skin and nails.  It is an easy capsule to swallow, my stomach was fine to digest it. It has a made a big difference in the tickles an healthiness of my hair.  A great compliment to the shampoo.  Healthy hair all starts from the inside. Im super glad I found this product.</li>
    <li> Love the improvement this had on my hair to make it thicker, shinier and healthier. It took awhile to notice the difference, but can say it does help in having super lovely locks!</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx is great, I have been using it for a several weeks and it definitely works! My hair is stronger, fuller and no longer losing any hair in the shower. With all of the vitamins and keratin that this product has in it, you won&#x27;t find another product on the market that will rejuvenate your hair like this can! I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to add years to your hair and give you thicker and fuller hair!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 months now and I can see a drastic change I truly truly love this product</li>
    <li> I have suffered from dull, thin hair all of my life no matter what I used on it. A friend told me that about this supplement and I decided to give it a try. I am glad I did! My hair is thicker, longer, and shinier. I get so many compliments on my hair now from friends and co-workers. Definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> This stuff is a dream, after about 3 weeks you can start seeing a difference, my hair stopped falling out every time I brushed or took a shower which is a very good feeling. Also I started to notice I was growing new hairs and now my hair is thicker and healthier and I love this product. I would defiantly give this stuff a try, I recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> It works!! Even for coarse hair like mine (I&#x27;m African American) it has worked wonders. My edges had thinned really bad but after just a few weeks I started to notice the difference. I&#x27;ve only been taking these pills for a month now but I also feel my hair is stronger and growing faster. That&#x27;s more than I could&#x27;ve asked for!! I&#x27;ll gladly be keeping these in stock. I&#x27;ve recommended these to my mom whose hair is thinning and after a week and a half she is delighted with the results!</li>
    <li> ULTRAX LABS HAIR LOSS WORKS !! I tryd the shampoo and other products from them and it actually works and best off all they are at a great price</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t believe anything would thicken my super straight, fine hair. I all but gave up on the various products I&#x27;ve tried over the years, then a friend told me about Hair Maxx--otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it. I decided I&#x27;d give it a try and after a couple of months, people have been telling me how great my hair looks! I didn&#x27;t notice it at first, but seeing recent pictures, there really is a difference. It also holds a style much better. My hair would be flat again after setting it in the morning, now it&#x27;s still full and wavy even after working out!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been skeptical of hair growth supplements because I didn&#x27;t see any results with Biotin. When my friend introduced me to The Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx DHT I figured, why not give it a shot? After 2 months of trying this product out, I could not be more happier to write a five star review on this product. My hair is thicker, my receding hairline is improved. There are no out of the ordinary ingredients in this supplement that could cause any harm to you, and that&#x27;s also why I love it.  Absolutely would recommend this to anyone suffering from hair loss, receding hair lines, etc. five stars!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, I have used other similar items in the past and had no luck, I was just about to give up and shave my head until I stumbled across this stuff, saw it had great reviews and decided to give it one last go around, I took it regularly as directed and within 2 1/2 to 3 months I noticed new hair growth and my hair I had was stronger and more thick and healthy looking, to say the least i was very surprised at the great results I got, I have been using it ever since and results keep getting better, I have noticed girls have been looking at me differently and starting up conversions with me and that was not the case when i was starting to bald and had noticeably thinning hair. so that is a defiantly  plus in my book. I have a couple buddies that I told about this stuff and they have got some as well with the same results. Im so happy I did not have to shave my head or go to an expensive specialist. If your looking to look better and make some new friends with your new found confidence the is the way to do it, no doubt about it. Thanks Hair Maxx you changed my life</li>

    <li> After experiencing years of hair loss and thinning I&#x27;ve tried tons of products without success.  A friend recommended Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx Supplement after the success she&#x27;s had with the product.  I&#x27;ve now been on the product 30 days and I can&#x27;t believe all the results I&#x27;ve already had.  I have two really trouble some spots and not only has it stopped my hair loss I&#x27;ve started to see hair growth in both areas.  I&#x27;ve noticed a huge decrease in shedding, my hair finally feels thicker and healthier.  My best friend of 14 years has even commented on how noticeable it has been she said my hair looks more &amp;#34;youthful&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Most Amazing Product In A While. Was Looking All Over ForA Solution &amp; I&#x27;m Thankful To Have Found One. I Highly Recommend This Product! Two Thumbs Up!</li>
    <li> I must admit I&#x27;m impressed with this supplement. I&#x27;ve been using this along with a great shampoo product and I just love the results! I&#x27;ve started to grow new hairs and the ones I&#x27;m getting are nice, thick, and curly like the ones I had back in high-school. I&#x27;ve followed the instructions on the bottle exactly and this seems to actually be a good deal for the supply you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are on the fence about buying I suggest you give it at least a one bottle try. I was skeptical at first but now I&#x27;m actually looking forward to taking it... I&#x27;m actually gonna have some hair!</li>
    <li> Vitamin supplement accompanied with maximizing hair growth, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a win-win outcome.  You will be satisfied with Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx DHT.</li>
    <li> Very nice, I&#x27;m very happy with this product,  is not only good for your hair, my  nail and skin are looking better, and I also like that my stomach doesn&#x27;t get sick from it like  with other products .  This is a most buy. 5☆</li>
    <li> Wow its amazing how much these vitamins can affect your hair, I have been taking them for the past week and hair looks so much healthier than it use to. Not to mention the small strands of baby hair I can see growing ! Definitely a repurchase kind of product. Shipping was really fast I received my vitamins within a day of ordering. I highly recommend these if you suffer from heavy hair loss.</li>
    <li> After adding this product to my usual diet (heavy in protein and veggies) I have noticed my hair growing. Typically my thin hair only grows to a certain length before breaking, however this month I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s gown a bit past that point. I do not have significant hair loss to begin with (just would like it to grow longer), but am hoping at my slight &amp;#34;widow&#x27;s peak&amp;#34; areas to have some growth. Will update in the future if I&#x27;m seeing additional change. I don&#x27;t think this is a miracle pill, however, it does help stubborn hair to grow. Haven&#x27;t noticed all over body hair growth as other reviews indicate.</li>
    <li> experienced severe headache and dizziness, had to return</li>
    <li> It is hard to know how well it works with less then a month use. Time will tell.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working good noticing a difference and some results!! Better than other hair supplements I&#x27;ve used. Seeing how it continues with more use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve started using this product to strengthen my hair and prevent more hair loss than what I was already experiencing. After about a 2 month of use I see a big difference between how my hair looked and how much thicker it got. My hair stopped falling out and also looks a lot healthier and won&#x27;t break as easily.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but I thought I&#x27;d give it a try because I only do well with natural supplements.  It contains all natural ingredients, B vitamins and herbs for hair regrowth. So far I must say I am impressed, my hair appears to be a bit thicker and falling out less than before. My girlfriend sees it too.</li>
    <li> I tried Ultras Labs Hair Maxx Hair Loss Vitamin Supplement for over a month, and so far I have seen excellent results.It has given me longer, healthier,and thicker hair. I have developed a good amount of new hair growth, and can&#x27;t wait to see the results another month from now. I love this product!</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs continues to dish out great products. Their Hair Maxx DHT Blocking Hair Loss Hair Growth Nutrient Solubilized Keratin Vitamin Supplement works just as good as their growth thickening treatment. It&#x27;s the perfect compliment to an already great line of products. Between the two, I&#x27;ve consistently noticed positive results in my hair.</li>
    <li> What do you do when your thick beautiful hair starts thinning? Buy Hair Maxx. It takes a few weeks to take effect, but once it does you will start to notice your hair will be as healthy as it was before. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx is fantastic! I cannot believe how well it works! My hair is now fuller, thicker and the best part is that it does not fall out anymore! I am so happy and impressed with Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx and I highly recommend it! It is the best!</li>
    <li> Works great! This brand comes out with great products for hair loss.</li>
    <li> I feel like this product along with a few other hair loss prevention products, is a sure fire way of curbing hair loss.  I have been losing my hair for the past few years and combating it has been my sole purpose lately.  This is a great way to go about it!  I love Ultrax Labs products in general and this is among the top in my book.</li>
    <li> Great Choice! I&#x27;ve been using this for two months and can see improvements. These supplements are loaded with all of the ingredients known to fight hair loss. Instead of taking pumpkin seed, saw palmetto, and biotin separately, which I&#x27;ve done - I get these ingredients and more out of this one product. I&#x27;m also sure to do a nightly massage on my scalp to improve the circulation. I take the two pills after dinner. Makes things simpler and I&#x27;m happy and will continue my use. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This product really works. After only a few uses I could see the results. I have been waiting to find a solution to my thinning hair and I&#x27;ve finally found it. Trust me you have to try this product.</li>
    <li> It took me about a month to start seeing any changes, by two months my hair had pretty much stopped falling out!! new growth is both stronger and thicker. Plus you can notice your nails and skin look healthier.  This product works and there is no side effects!</li>
    <li> My &amp;#34;widow&#x27;s peak&amp;#34; has become more pronounced as I&#x27;ve gotten older and started losing more at the temples, but things seem to be slowing down. There&#x27;s noticeably less shedding now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel cautiously optimistic!</li>
    <li> This used in conjunction with Ultrax Labs Hair stimulating shampoo is a phenomenal combination. Ultrax Labs has the science aspect down of making great product. Super impressive!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Gave my hair the revitalization it needed. Now my hair is more vibrant and fuller. The extra boost in keratin also helped strengthen and accelerate  my nail growth. It is easy to use and rubs  in quick.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx enhances, promotes hair growth and thickness in the form of a supplement. It helps your hair grow. It contains essential vitamins needed to aid your hair in circulation. It&#x27;s accelerates hair growth while decreasing hair loss with no side effects. The best part is that it&#x27;s completely safe for both men and women!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and am starting to see a noticeable difference in my hair loss, or lack thereof.  Hair feels fuller and I&#x27;m losing less to the old drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried to do my research on products like this in the past regarding ingredients, methods, and reviews.  At the end of the day we all have 2 real questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Does is work? (Yes)&lt;br /&gt;2.  Is it safe? (Yes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With both of those criteria being met, this is a strong recommendation for a product that&#x27;s moving my hair in the right direction alongside my confidence and public perception.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical of this product (and the many others that I have tried). However, after a couple months of using Ultrax, I have noticed much less hair in my brush and comb and my hair is fuller than it&#x27;s ever been. I have been able to let my hair grow out a bit, for first time in a long time. Pretty amazing!!</li>
    <li> When a man loses his hair is like losing his masculinity. Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx DHT helped to stop shedding hair, in the beginning it made shedding slow down, then it made it stop. I like that it contains more than 20 essential minerals, vitamins and herbs combined to invigorate hair follicles and spur faster growth. Once you try this product for yourself you will notice that your hair is stronger, less shedding, fuller, and noticeably growing. I wouldn&#x27;t go with anything else on the market!</li>
    <li> This is definitely a miracle supplement in my opinion. The Keratin ingredient makes each hair follicle thicker and more vibrant. Before I mainly relied on Biotin but if you switch to the Ultrax supplement you will begin to see faster hair growth thanks to the additional essential vitamins within the first week. Thinning hair and shedding is directly related to the amount of vitamins and Keratin in your body and this product targets these exact areas, providing you a 1 month supply.The Nettle Leaf Powder, Pumpkin Seed Powder, Biotin, Zinc, etc. are all masterfully combined to boost follicle growth. The directions are simple, take 2 capsules a day with a meal and you will begin to notice better hair texture and growth. I am happy to say this has stopped hair breakage when tying, curling or straightening hair and has provided relief to hair worries. I recommend it to whoever wants to get rid of stress due to hair loss and see their hair stronger and healthy once again!</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know about the products from the other companies related to my hair &amp;#34;problem,&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m sticking with the variety that this Ultrax Labs offers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the last few years my hair has been thinning. (Both Mom and Dad wear hairpieces, so I think you can see what my fate is!) I have two sisters and two brothers, all middle-aged like myself. All us girls in the family for some reason have gotten the thinning &amp;#34;middle&amp;#34; part on the top of the head. (Is is really heartbreaking for a family of beautiful Filipinas to watch this happen!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ex-boyfriend gave me a gift of a bottle of stuff from another company and I couldn&#x27;t even open the bottle all the way because of the odor of the product. The Hair Maxx is just tablets, which I neglected to take until this last month, since I was using the bottles of the company&#x27;s other products. (I think my ex-boyfriend reviewed the other products he bought me on here.) There was one spot that seemed to be the exception to growing before I took these, but I have been watching it &amp;#34;fill in&amp;#34; for about a week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not one to &amp;#34;jinx&amp;#34; anything by speaking too soon about it, but this stuff works for me and if I can&#x27;t get my stubborn sisters to use it I need to get it for them as a gift. Maybe we could get the family discount?</li>
    <li> This product was purchased for my grandma who suffers from hair loss! It&#x27;s done wonders on her hair and she now has a lot more self-confidence! Don&#x27;t expect this product to work overnight though, it does take a little bit of time to see results from person to person. This is a much recommended product nonetheless! :)</li>
