      <li>this is absolutely the best deodorant i have ever found.  </li>
      <li>This is by far, the best deodorant I have ever used!</li>
      <li>This is the best &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried most of the ones on the market, since I&#x27;m allergic to the ingredients in standard deodorant).</li>
      <li>Especially after all the awesome reviews.  </li>
      <li>My adolescent daughter found that the natural deodorants like Tom&#x27;s didn&#x27;t work for her--this one works just great.  </li>
      <li>So far, it is just as good.</li>
      <li>I layer this with the powder and Lush natural deodorant powder (guv&#x27;ner) and it works great!</li>
      <li>Works great and lasts a long time, both my wife and I use it.</li>
      <li>not bad i dont sweet like that</li>
      <li>I had Lemon grass essential oils to this and love it!  </li>
      <li>stick or spray worth every penny.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for delicate areas.  </li>
      <li>I really did!  </li>
      <li>It works really well!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m kind of shocked, this is the first natural deodorant that has worked for me. :D</li>
      <li>I use the rock form and it&#x27;s effective for me (whereas the other ones don&#x27;t work for me either).</li>
      <li>This product really works I have used others and before the end of my work shift</li>
      <li>is what is important to know; if you use regular over the counter deoderants, especially with anit-perspirant, you are \\&quot;CLOGGING\\&quot; the pores under your arm.  </li>
      <li>This is the only mineral based, non chemical deodorant spray I&#x27;ve used that really really works.</li>
      <li>Holds last all day really really really really really well</li>
      <li>If you want to have a natural deoderant, use this product twice a day and it will kill the bacteria under your arm effciently.  </li>
      <li>Still trying to find an all natural deodorant.  </li>
      <li>natural ingredients,&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
      <li>Sweating you release chemicals from the body, you are stopping the natural action</li>

      <li>/&gt;Get natural, be healthy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Maybe it takes a minute more to dry than the mainstream products but that is little price to pay to avoid damaging my skin!</li>
      <li>This product was recommended to me by a kind person on the Internet when I complained about other deodorant sprays causing skin rashes.  </li>
      <li>Ladies...think of what could possibly happen if you keep clogging your natural sweating mechanisim here?  </li>
      <li>My only complaint is that it runs out rather quickly considering the price.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this product for over five years now. This is the only mineral based, non chemical deodorant spray I&#x27;ve used that really really works. I used to buy it at the store, but now I get it online. Try this one out, folks! You&#x27;ll never go back to another deodorant again. I&#x27;m only saying this because I don&#x27;t want this company to stop making this product! Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it.</li>
    <li> this is absolutely the best deodorant i have ever found.  it prevents odor for the promised 24 hours!  stick or spray worth every penny.</li>
    <li> not bad i dont sweet like that anyways and i dont have to respray it thur the day just once so i will be purchasing this again</li>
    <li> We have used Crystelle for years, but they have discontinued it and the company, Liv-On Labs recommended the Crystalux for a replacement. So far, it is just as good.</li>
    <li> I layer this with the powder and Lush natural deodorant powder (guv&#x27;ner) and it works great! (Just a tip: of you have b.o. problems, stop using bar soap and soak your shirts in baking soda and hang dry them. Stop using the dryer!).</li>
    <li> This product really works I have used others and before the end of my work shift I could tell it was wearing off. This works all day to control oder.</li>
    <li> Works great and lasts a long time, both my wife and I use it.</li>
    <li> I had Lemon grass essential oils to this and love it!  Holds last all day really really really really really well</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Even when I&#x27;m working in my yard and pouring sweat I still don&#x27;t have any odor. Wish they still carried this deodorant it in the Sprouts grocery store for my conveniece....at least I can order it. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27; sweat a lot, this is it.</li>
    <li> This is by far, the best deodorant I have ever used! Very effective!</li>
    <li> This is the best &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried most of the ones on the market, since I&#x27;m allergic to the ingredients in standard deodorant).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for delicate areas.  I spray all over my body after I shower.  I still use my regular deodorant  with it.</li>
    <li> I use this as a body spray as well as to wet my underarms for easier application of the solid crystal. It works really well! My only complaint is that it runs out rather quickly considering the price. Using about 12 sprays per day, this would last me about a month.</li>
    <li> My adolescent daughter found that the natural deodorants like Tom&#x27;s didn&#x27;t work for her--this one works just great.  I use the rock form and it&#x27;s effective for me (whereas the other ones don&#x27;t work for me either).</li>
    <li> If you want to have a natural deoderant, use this product twice a day and it will kill the bacteria under your arm effciently.  No smell!  It does not protect from sweating.  The solid sticks do not deliver enough of the mineral to keep from having bacteria overgrowth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what is important to know; if you use regular over the counter deoderants, especially with anit-perspirant, you are \\&quot;CLOGGING\\&quot; the pores under your arm.  Ladies...think of what could possibly happen if you keep clogging your natural sweating mechanisim here?  Sweating you release chemicals from the body, you are stopping the natural action is this area.  There are lots of lymphatics in this area and you need them to stay open and release their toxins.  Toxins stay in the fat cells and release through the lymph system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, they contain the toxic heavy metal ALUMINUM.  Just look up what this metal can do to your body in toxic amounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need I say more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get natural, be healthy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr Price</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I have been using this product for at least 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;No marks are left on your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;No perfumes/fragrances from spray. (I have allergies and I&#x27;m sensitive to odors)&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t harm environment because it is a pump spray.&lt;br /&gt;Works well, no body odor.&lt;br /&gt;All natural ingredients,&lt;br /&gt;Have only used for underarms.&lt;br /&gt;True to it&#x27;s label.</li>
    <li> A poor deodorant product.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a kind person on the Internet when I complained about other deodorant sprays causing skin rashes.  And yes: no more rashes after switching to it!  Maybe it takes a minute more to dry than the mainstream products but that is little price to pay to avoid damaging my skin!</li>
    <li> I wanted it to!  I really did!  Especially after all the awesome reviews.  Still trying to find an all natural deodorant.  On to the next!</li>
    <li> Actually works! No stink! I&#x27;m kind of shocked, this is the first natural deodorant that has worked for me. :D</li>
