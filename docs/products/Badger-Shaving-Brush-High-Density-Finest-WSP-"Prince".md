      <li>/&gt;I started to shave more often with this brush, I love it!</li>

      <li>/&gt;Update 2: This brush continues to function better as it breaks in.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this brush.</li>

      <li>but I&#x27;m just really enjoying the creams</li>
      <li>Yes, it costs more than others, but when I&#x27;m still using this brush 5, 10, 15 years from now -I</li>
      <li>The badger it is incredible soft and the sensation given is unique,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Will bump up one more star.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I went with this one.</li>
      <li>Fits perfect in hand with three fingers gripping and flat bottom against your palm.  </li>
      <li>There aren&#x27;t many brushes available anymore.  </li>
      <li>If feels like the perfect combo of soft tips and a good spread with the back bone of a two band.  </li>
      <li>So far this brush has been great.  </li>
      <li>What I would recommend is looking at the Golden Nib and buy one of there knots and handles and just make your own.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really easy to do.</li>
      <li>This is a highly over rated brush and should be explained that it&#x27;s not really full sized and is good for a travelling brush at best.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how important this was, but being a silvertip brush on top of the extra packed hairs makes a HUGE difference!!!</li>
      <li>very high quality hair - softness to the tips but amazing backbone and flow-through.</li>
      <li>It is not too \\&quot;hard\\&quot; as I&#x27;ve read some cheap brushes are</li>
      <li>On the smaller side but works great.</li>
      <li>I feel its cheaply made and</li>
      <li>It will probably be my main brush for many years to come as I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with it.  </li>
      <li>This brush has very, very soft tips that, because of the density of the knot, stay in place so they really exfoliate and prepare your skin for a great shave.</li>
      <li>It is holding more lather and water in comparison to when I first got it.</li>
      <li>but about once a week I&#x27;ve had to clean out the drain in my bathroom sink because it&#x27;s getting clogged with badger hair.</li>
      <li>Nice &amp; soft bristles</li>
      <li>Holds water good and lathers better than my previous.  </li>
      <li>I agree with the other reviews that this is a great brush.</li>
      <li>the retail price and for that it was a super deal.  </li>
      <li>It lathers up super quick and holds a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>I bought one of these several months ago and at first I loved it.</li>
      <li>Like I said the before, the silver tip hairs, spread and back bone just feel amazing against your face.</li>
      <li>I use it to lather directly on my face most of the time.</li>
      <li>I honestly can&#x27;t recommend this brush highly enough.  </li>
      <li>Not even a hint right out of the box.  </li>
      <li>right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The brush remains in excellent condition despite 1.5 years of use, the hair remains firmly attached and has remained the proper stiffness to lather well.</li>
      <li>This was exactly the type of shaving brush I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Simply put at this price I was expecting way more.</li>
      <li>Its exactly what I was looking for and I&#x27;m amazed that it cost 1/3 of the amount of ones</li>
      <li>it you like smaller more compact brushes.</li>
      <li>I first bought the boar brush from WSP and was wowed by it.</li>
      <li>This is my first brush</li>
      <li>The lather at this point only on second use is not as good as I have seen from examples in the Art for Shaving store</li>
      <li>Maybe one or two strands came off, can&#x27;t really remember but super high build quality.  </li>
      <li>One has to really brush a lot over the face to generate a good lather and also, the handle grip is small to my liking.</li>
      <li>Really helps make a full and rich lather every single time and fast.</li>
      <li>He really likes it.</li>
      <li>HIGH DENSITY INDEED!</li>
      <li>Brush works very well for me.</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t say a whole lot</li>
      <li>Still overpriced but a decent performer</li>
      <li>I have decent size cheeks/long neck</li>
      <li>It creates and releases massive amounts of lather, really quickly.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product, six stars if I could.</li>
      <li>I had bought him a high quality brush 16 years ago and it just gave out.  </li>
      <li>Spend a few dollars more and get a legitimate shaving brush.</li>
      <li>I will have forgotten about the cost long before I&#x27;ll realize the true value of this brush.</li>
      <li>This routine has definitely improved my skin condition, as I rarely get ingrown hairs and skin irritations anymore.</li>
      <li>Tons of backbone and very soft bristles.</li>
      <li>I switched to lathering directly on my face just because of how this bush feels!</li>
      <li>Other than the small size its a good brush.</li>
      <li>So far I have used this exclusively with creams and in a scuttle.</li>
      <li>I was surprised but with badger brushes price does make a difference.</li>
      <li>but I like this brush so far.</li>
      <li>I would definitely suggest to anyone looking for this type of brush to go with a high end model.  </li>
      <li>Barely lost any hairs.</li>
      <li>Its holding more water and it lathers well but not great.</li>
      <li>Being new to wet shaving, and after reading on-line about brushes, I had concerns in brushes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very nice brush. Creates a great lather even though I use a shaving cream that really does not lather great.  Feels great on the face!</li>
    <li> and this too has surpassed my expectations. I first bought the boar brush from WSP and was wowed by it. Then I was looking for a 2 band silvertip and saw this one, just what I was looking for. On the small side, just firm enough, and very soft tips, what&#x27;s not to like and the price is very good for the quality.</li>
    <li> There aren&#x27;t many brushes available anymore.  This one seems to be great quality.  I think I will be using it for years to come.</li>
    <li> So far this brush has been great.  I have had no issues with hair coming out or any kind of smell.  It has a tight weave and seems like as other reviews have said will take some time to break in.  I only shave 1 or 2 times per week so it might take me a while to get it perfect.  The lather at this point only on second use is not as good as I have seen from examples in the Art for Shaving store but I think it will get there soon enough.  I got this brush at a great price like 1/3 the retail price and for that it was a super deal.  I would definitely suggest to anyone looking for this type of brush to go with a high end model.  I was surprised but with badger brushes price does make a difference.</li>
    <li> This is a highly over rated brush and should be explained that it&#x27;s not really full sized and is good for a travelling brush at best.</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES this shaving brush.  I had bought him a high quality brush 16 years ago and it just gave out.  He purchased a cheap brush that felt awful and performed terribly.  he is so happy with this!</li>
    <li> This is my second brush.  It arrived sterilized and tissue wrapped and didn&#x27;t have that funky smell that most brushes have.  I immediately noticed that the size was what I wanted.  The brush ends are soft and it has a stiff backbone.  Holds water good and lathers better than my previous.  Its exactly what I was looking for and I&#x27;m amazed that it cost 1/3 of the amount of ones I was considering buying.</li>
    <li> really good value.  I have been using this brush for over a month and it consistently delivers  very good lather with creams and pucks alike.</li>
    <li> This is my first brush so I can&#x27;t say a whole lot but I like this brush so far. I haven&#x27;t had any problem producing good lather.</li>
    <li> After doing a lot of search I finalized this product. However when i started using this, it didnt meet my expectation. One has to really brush a lot over the face to generate a good lather and also, the handle grip is small to my liking. Considering its price and utility, wish i could have skipped this product..</li>
    <li> I bought one of these several months ago and at first I loved it. It&#x27;s lost ALLOT of hair though and I&#x27;m not known kidding when I say this, but about once a week I&#x27;ve had to clean out the drain in my bathroom sink because it&#x27;s getting clogged with badger hair. If you do a little research losing some hair for the first three months is normal, but I&#x27;m way past that now with this brush. What I would recommend is looking at the Golden Nib and buy one of there knots and handles and just make your own. It&#x27;s really easy to do. You just glue the knot into the handle and let it dry and your done!</li>
    <li> Boyfriend has had it for almost two years, LOVES it. I did tons of research on this stuff and I&#x27;m glad I went with this one.</li>
    <li> Being new to wet shaving, and after reading on-line about brushes, I had concerns in brushes. All concerns were negated in this brush. No smell and no shedding set my fears at ease. Quality in materials and build make this a brush I&#x27;ll have for years! Yes, it costs more than others, but when I&#x27;m still using this brush 5, 10, 15 years from now -I doubt I&#x27;ll be concerned about how much I spent on quality -in fact I feel that the brush is a bargain for the quality received. I will have forgotten about the cost long before I&#x27;ll realize the true value of this brush. Get one, you won&#x27;t be sorry!!</li>
    <li> I have had 2 silvertip badger shaving brushes this is number 3. Simply put at this price I was expecting way more. The brush is small. The brush is a bit stiff. I feel its cheaply made and this nonsense marketing about dual band means nothing. Spend a few dollars more and get a legitimate shaving brush. This did not make the cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: still feel this should be described as a small head brush. Still feel its overpriced. However it is performing better after some break in time. My Parker brushes required no break in time. The dual band design does have some merit. It is holding more lather and water in comparison to when I first got it. Would I buy this again. NO. But I am upgrading to 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2: This brush continues to function better as it breaks in. Its holding more water and it lathers well but not great. Its also softened up a bit. Other than the small size its a good brush. Still overpriced but a decent performer it you like smaller more compact brushes. Will bump up one more star.</li>
    <li> The badger it is incredible soft and the sensation given is unique,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started to shave more often with this brush, I love it!</li>
    <li> On the small side and exactly what I was looking for. I have decent size cheeks/long neck and this fills my face nicely (a large brush just gets very sloppy). Barely lost any hairs. No smell. HIGH DENSITY INDEED! I didn&#x27;t realize how important this was, but being a silvertip brush on top of the extra packed hairs makes a HUGE difference!!! Really helps make a full and rich lather every single time and fast. Absolutely love this brush.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe a silver tip for this price.  To start off I would like to say this thing just performs.  It lathers and massages the skin perfectly. If feels like the perfect combo of soft tips and a good spread with the back bone of a two band.  There is also zero funk.  Not even a hint right out of the box.  Maybe one or two strands came off, can&#x27;t really remember but super high build quality.  Fits perfect in hand with three fingers gripping and flat bottom against your palm.  Like I said the before, the silver tip hairs, spread and back bone just feel amazing against your face. I switched to lathering directly on my face just because of how this bush feels!</li>
    <li> Brush works very well for me. Good price and shipping service.</li>
    <li> Bought for my hubby for a gift. He really likes it. Nice &amp; soft bristles</li>
    <li> This was exactly the type of shaving brush I was looking for. I often use soaps &amp; face lather, this brush delivers...it&#x27;s also effective at making lather with creams and using a bowl... very high quality hair - softness to the tips but amazing backbone and flow-through. It&#x27;s a perfect size loft with incredible density. Overall, an unbeatable value - wish I would have purchased this before I spent big bucks on the English and German brands. Highly recommend this product, six stars if I could.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviews that this is a great brush. This is my only brush, so I am only comparing it to the good and bad things I&#x27;ve read about other brushes. So far I have used this exclusively with creams and in a scuttle. I have a couple soaps I will eventually try but I&#x27;m just really enjoying the creams right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good:&lt;br /&gt;- It has not lost a single hair&lt;br /&gt;- I find the size is near perfect&lt;br /&gt;- It is not too \\&quot;floppy\\&quot; as I&#x27;ve read some silvertips are&lt;br /&gt;- It is not too \\&quot;hard\\&quot; as I&#x27;ve read some cheap brushes are&lt;br /&gt;- It lathers up super quick and holds a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad:&lt;br /&gt;- It does not fit properly in the stand I purchased - [[ASIN:B001XURHNY Colonel Conk Evernice Model 775 Chrome Safety Razor Stand]] (The handle is too thick)</li>
    <li> This is a great brush at a very competitive price. Tons of backbone and very soft bristles. On the smaller side but works great.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brush for 1.5 years now and it&#x27;s time for a review. It is an excellent brush. I use it to lather directly on my face most of the time. I have a collection of shaving cream/soap products and have found that it works well with all of them. The brush remains in excellent condition despite 1.5 years of use, the hair remains firmly attached and has remained the proper stiffness to lather well. The finish on the handle did chip when I accidentally dropped it in the sink, but that is my fault. I would buy this brush again.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I&#x27;m no expert in the field, and this brush is just my second brush. It will probably be my main brush for many years to come as I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with it.  I was in the market for a good quality brush that provides my face with lots of scrub and no prickliness, and I could not have found a better one. I also wanted a dense knot that would not be floppy. This brush has very, very soft tips that, because of the density of the knot, stay in place so they really exfoliate and prepare your skin for a great shave. The hairs are on the stiff side but this does not stop it from having a good flow through. It creates and releases massive amounts of lather, really quickly. I almost exclusively face lather with this brush, using a triple-milled hard soap. A couple of twirls on the puck and voila! I have enough lather for 3+ passes. I honestly can&#x27;t recommend this brush highly enough.  I even use it on none shave days to give my face a good scrub, and keep my skin in top shape. This routine has definitely improved my skin condition, as I rarely get ingrown hairs and skin irritations anymore.</li>
