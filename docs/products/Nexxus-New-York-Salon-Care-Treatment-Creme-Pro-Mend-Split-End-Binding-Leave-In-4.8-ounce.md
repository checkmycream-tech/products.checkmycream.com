<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m really liking this right now.  I saw someone on Youtube with really damaged hair and she said that using this along with a couple of other products she shared, really improved the integrity of her hair.  So far, the product is working well for me!</li>
    <li> Great stuff - I relax my hair and split ends are a significant problem for me.  I use oils, but I don&#x27;t like to use too much, as they weigh my hair down and I don&#x27;t like the way oily hair feels.  This treatment is fantastic - I use twice a day and it really makes my hair soft and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item on amazon and it came and the item was clearly opened, the box was damaged, and the cream had spilled out of the container. I love this product, when i bought it at target and it was brand new. i dont recommend this seller, as if you get a damaged product, they dont return, and i had to go through amazon for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it three stars because its a great product, but the seller was bad. Id buy it in a store to guarantee youre buying the good quality product, as opposed to a damaged one like i recieved.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft and it does repair my split ends.  Smells clean too.  Definitely recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product.  I have had frizzy hair for a few years now.  I just turned 40, so it may be an age thing (I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair is becoming a little coarser).  I&#x27;ve always had dry hair (and skin) and my hair is very fine to begin with, so it breaks easily.  I also get my hair highlighted every few months, which can&#x27;t be good for my hair either.  I tend to get split ends rather quickly-- so much so that the bottom of my hair tends to sort of fan out a little instead of hanging straight.  I&#x27;ve tried every product I could find that promised frizz removal: shampoos &amp; conditioners, leave-in treatments, natural oils, anti-frizz serums, etc.  Nothing worked.  It was especially embarrassing because the hairs that would break near the top of my head would also frizz up, making my hair condition even more noticable.  I was skeptical about ProMend, but decided to give it a shot.  Let me tell you, this product does what it says it will.  From the first application, I noticed a significant difference.  But the real difference was that this effect lasted!  The directions say to apply about once a week, but it can be used more often if needed.  I first used it about 3 days ago and can&#x27;t find a single split end!  The directions say it will work from the first application-- and it does.  It&#x27;s brought down the frizz on the top of my head as well.  I am so happy, so relieved to have finally found something that actually works for me.  My hair looks so much healthier and just better in general.  Very glad I don&#x27;t have to be so self-conscious about my frizz anymore.</li>
    <li> i really want to know science behind how these work because i&#x27;m actually seeing results!!! like how? does it just stick my split ends together again? does it secretly cut the ends of my hair!!!</li>
    <li> This product ACTUALLY WORKS! It smells great and works as an excellent styling aid for the tips, too (easier to curl - and if I put it all over my hair I wouldn&#x27;t need a frizz-reducing product). WOW! I also used the overnight creme and I could see results after the first night, especially on my flatiron-damaged bangs.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I bought the ProMend shampoo and leave in conditioner because of the great reviews.  Maybe people do not understand what an actual split end is but this product does not work whatsoever!  There has been no change to my hair AT ALL.</li>
    <li> Saw the commercials for the pro-mend line, but was pretty skeptical. Decided to try the leave-in conditioner. It works as advertised and smells great. You will see fewer split/broken ends. Not sure if the repair is really permanent or just improves appearance. Definitely worth the price as you only use a small amount each time.</li>
    <li> The product says it will use awesome space technology to bind your split ends back together after one use and reduce the number of visible split ends by 92% (a specific number obviously determined through space statistics).    It does this. It&#x27;s not magic, but it IS a great illusion magic trick that makes your hair feel like it has less split ends, and look like it has less split ends. Nothing short of a hair cut can actually get rid of your split ends.    The cream is this lotion that you rub on your split ends. The lotion sticks the split ends together so that it looks like your hair has been healed. It is very convincing. I had to really look to find the split ends in my hair and I could see the binding technology in action. You can unbind the ends if you try, but really, don&#x27;t do that. That&#x27;s bad for your hair.    The lotion will wash out if you wash your hair, so you have to reapply after a shower. It also doesn&#x27;t work as well with excessive use of heat products like a flat iron or a curler, but that&#x27;s pretty obvious.    Get this. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> Works great! Perfect product to use for in between trips to the hair stylist.</li>
    <li> This stuff really does seem to glue the ends of your hair together so that split ends are not noticeable.  Other than that, it doesn&#x27;t seem to change the texture of my hair at all.</li>
    <li> this product is not magical, but it seems to help prevent further breakage. the improvement may not be apparent though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had horribly damaged hair ever since I came to college 2 years ago. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the water, a new diet, or a combination, but my hair went from being silky, long, and luxurious (I&#x27;m Asian, so I had stereotypical Asian textured hair) to dry and falling apart. I tried everything, and even completely stopped blowdrying my hair for a while. Nothing seemed to help, and my ends were just as split and dry as ever no matter what I tried, even after a trim! Not only are my ends split, but my hair tends to break at a point further up the shaft, so I can just pluck off the ends of my hair (it&#x27;s become a bit of a habit in class).     I contemplated just chopping it all off, but I love my long hair, so I decided to take a chance on this. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times as of writing this originally, and while no miracles have happened yet, my ends are no longer straw colored, and even feel a lot nicer, but if you look closely, they&#x27;re still really split and damaged. One plus is that it does smell really nice, and I find that a little bit goes a long way. If I put too much on, though, it makes the ends of my hair oddly \\&quot;fluffy,\\&quot; but I&#x27;ll just have to learn to apply the right amount. I am hoping that continued use will yield even further progress! I will be sure to keep you all updated, but these are my first impressions.</li>
    <li> I have just below shoulder length hair that I&#x27;ve been trying to grow out. Only problem is that I have tons of layers, I blowdry every day, I dye my dishwater blonde hair to a medium to dark brown, and I also highlight. The only thing that I could do worse to my hair is if I added flat-ironing to my routine. My hair has been stuck at this length ever since I chopped it off up to my chin a few years ago on a whim. If i let it grow much longer than this, it gets bad split ends. This morning I used the conditioner plus this treatment creme and already I think these products are finally going to help me grow my hair out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was the smell - it smells like a vanilla cookie candle. The kind they sell around Christmas a lot. And it&#x27;s strong. I also used Biosilk (which also has a pretty strong scent) and I can&#x27;t even smell it over the Nexxus. It&#x27;s not a bad smell (unless you don&#x27;t like it), but it&#x27;s a lot stronger than most hair care products I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed as soon as I used the conditioner that my hair felt...different. Hair always feels so smooth after conditioning, but this was different. It hung all together and straight. I was excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I let my hair air dry for a little bit, I put the leave in creme in. My hair seemed to instantly detangle and smooth out even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very impressed with this product. It does give your hair a very distinct feeling, however, that some might not like. It&#x27;s hard to describe, but your hair is slick, but not oily. You can kind of feel that the hair shafts are glued back together. However, that&#x27;s still a lot better than the alternative of having knotted, damaged hair. Bottom line - if you like the smell, buy these products.</li>
    <li> Product wasn&#x27;t even close to full when I got it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  I have frizzy, kinky hair.  I received a sample from somewhere and thought I&#x27;d give it a try to see if it would control the frizz.  I didn&#x27;t really have split ends because I had just had a hair cut fairly recently.  It only takes a little bit, so the bottle will last a long time for me.  I use maybe a nickel or quarter size squirt and rub it between my hands and then apply to my towel dried hair.  After styling with a flat iron, the next day my hair feels like silk.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  I have fine hair and it is not to heavy if I use just a tiny amount, makes my hair feel great!</li>
    <li> This stuff almost makes my hair worse. It&#x27;s horrible.</li>
    <li> easy to comb, but a little too heavy for my hair during summer time!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the shampoo, conditioner and leave in creme by Nexxus because of all of the positive reviews on Amazon. While I like the smell of the products and I think the shampoo and conditioner work well, I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference in my split ends. So while you will enjoy these products, I don&#x27;t think they do as good of a job at mending split ends as the other reviews say.</li>
    <li> My hair has been bleached, dyed, streaked, to the point where it&#x27;s so porous I needed a protein filler to color it again. I know nothing cures split or damaged hair. Have tried it all, even several $50.00 deep conditioners. So I bought this at Target to try, and I was shocked. I left it on overnight as directed, washed it with gentle shampoo the next morning and there was a big, noticeable difference. My frizzy hair was a lot smoother, and what surprised me was after another washing several days later, the effect was still there. The stylist who is taking care of my hair now (since I&#x27;m done with home jobs) made a comment on it. She felt the difference too. I will never be without this product again.</li>
    <li> This product does an excellent job of smoothing ends. I have medium length curly/frizzy hair that I am currently trying to grow out. My hair grows slow...slow...SLOW so I needed a product that would at the very least give the appearance of having no split ends because if I were to trim my hair every 6 to 8 weeks, I&#x27;d never be able to grow my hair out.     The product is a creamy moisturizer and has a light perfume smell. I admit the smell is annoying, but it goes away after about 30 minutes, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me enough to dock a star. It comes in a pump and 1 pump for my medium length hair is more than enough. A little definitely goes a long way. I would use no more than 2 pumps for even very long hair, concentrating on the last half of the length only.     Another thing I like about this product is that it works well with the other products I currently use. I have a couple of products I use daily and it fit well within the routine. I don&#x27;t like products where I feel like I must use it and it only, but this felt like a good addition, rather than a substitute for other products I already use and like.     I&#x27;m not a huge Nexxus fan and some of their other products have been sorely disappointing considering the price, but they really knocked it out of the park with this one. I plan on keeping this in my hair arsenal.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much.  It is getting hard to find.  I was glad I found it on Amazon...however, the despensing mechanism is flawed.  I have to take the cap off to get product.  This is unfortunate, as you have a harder time controlling the amount you need.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife after she tried Bio silk (she hated that one). She normally complains about all the fly aways she has. Shes used it three times &amp; says she notices a big difference.</li>
    <li> Absolutly LOVE the shampoo, actually no need for conditioner after you use it. However the leave-in treatment is HORRIBLE.     Made my hair (blonde and thin) weighted down, dingy and \\&quot;gross\\&quot; feeling. I did not see any positives to this treatment. I returned it and got my money back.     I DO NOT RECOMMEND anyone spending money on this. No results and it leaves your hair in worse condition than you had. However, the shampooo is WONDERFUL! They need improvement on this particular product, but again, the shampoo is great!     Hopefully I will find the conditioner in stock and I can try that. But really no need because the shampoo is great by itself.</li>
    <li> Does EXACTLY what it says &amp; what fully met my expectations (which is more than you can say for MANY products).  I have medium-to-thick, wavy, anglo hair that frizzes and breaks EASILY.  I&#x27;ve spent way too much money HOPING the next miracle product will finally be the answer to my woes (I now even compare INGREDIENTS to see if there is REALLY any difference between products).  I&#x27;ve never used Nexus products and am so glad I gave this a try, it TRULY made a difference on 1st use.  It is worth pointing out that it is intended to be a \\&quot;targeted\\&quot; treatment... which I interpreted to mean you don&#x27;t just put it all through your hair, you just apply on the ENDS and that works GREAT for me.</li>
    <li> I dont have to trim my hair as often, in fact, every three months, because i dont get split ends!</li>
    <li> Okay long story short, lost some hair due to an accident and some neurological meds, growing it back, really want to keep it healthy. I have had some breakage in the back of my head.  I have been using satin pillowcases to reduce breakage and a satin nightcap on my restless nights to stop snarls.  But I do have some broken ends because I am trying to grow my hair out from the hair loss I suffered and I&#x27;m going a  lot longer in between haircuts.  I tried this product as a standalone and it&#x27;s okay.  It will smooth your hair and stop the frizz, but you won&#x27;t see any dramatic frizz fixing long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So then I tried the overnight treatment in combination with the leave in treatment.  My hair was better, slightly less frizz on the ends, but I could feel that the back was still in rough shape.  I tried the leave in conditioner for 1 week before adding the overnight.  I tried the overnight cream with the day cream for 1 week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I decided to splurge and try the Nexxus ProMend shampoo and conditioner.  2 days.  In two days, using all four products there was an extreme and noticeable difference in the smoothness of my hair.  I was very much under the impression that you could not fix broken hair.  Truthfully in 2 days I noticed smoother hair.  The bottle says in 3 days use you will see results.  So maybe my hair wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought, or maybe it was because I&#x27;d already been treating my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is like any other shampoo, lather, rinse.  The conditioner you leave on for 3 minutes, comb through, I recently switched to the Tool Structure Shower Detangling Comb (http://www.amazon.com/Tool-Structure-Shower-Detangler-Comb/dp/B003JMWOR8) .  Both smell clean and delicious without being overpowering.  The leave in conditioner you put a quarter sized amount in your hand and run through your hair, concentrate on trouble zones and/or ends.  I used more than a quarter sized amount to nourish all my ends and the troubled back spot.  For the nigt time treatment you do not need to rewash your hair - unless you have a lot of product in there.  I just run about a quarter sized amount through my hair again and it soaks right in, leaving no residue.  In the morning, wash it out. I followed with the Nexxus shampoo and conditioner and started all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly that&#x27;s the most I&#x27;ve ever paid for conditioner, but sometimes you can get coupons on the retailer&#x27;s website.  It&#x27;s worth a try if you are trying to repair your hair.  Once you&#x27;ve done the repair, you might want to use it ever few days or a couple times a month and use another good shampoo and conditioner in between.  I also like John Freida&#x27;s Frizz repair shampoo and conditioner.you do not need to rewash your hair - unless you have a lot of product in there.

    <li> So I was looking for new products to treat my hair since its so damaged due to flat ironing it everyday especially my bangs and was tiered of having to cut off the ends all the time, plus I wanted to  let my hair grow longer. I read all the reviews about the Nexxus Promend line and decided to give a try to the shampoo, conditioner, and leave in treatment. I love the reasults it has on my hair. It smells great and I use it twice a week. The only problem is that I cannot put alot of it otherwise when I go to straighten my hair it leaves it too thick, and makes my hair seem dirty (kind of oily) and never put it on if your hair is completly dried otherwise its going to be hard to manage. Do it while your hair is still wet for best results.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that is wavy and gets frizzy and damaged from coloring and styling. I have lots of split ends that drive me crazy, even though I cut my hair every six weeks. I have tried may products to help with the frizz and protect my hair from damage but none have really worked well and many of them just weighed down my fine hair. I generally use products costing 2-3 times as much as this line, so I was surprised that this system worked so well.     I bought the whole system and started with the overnight treatment. It felt a little greasy going on, but it soaked in and by the morning my ends seemed much more hydrated. I then washed it out with the shampoo. I LOVE the shampoo - it has a good lather and feels like it really cleans, but leaves my hair moisterized. I hate when you wash out shampoo and your hair feels dried out. The conditioner was interesting. It was very creamy and I expected it to soak right in, but it initially just sits on your hair like a film. I combed it through and after a few minutes it felt like it had soaked in - you should definitely leave it on for the recommended time. My hair felt very silky when it rinsed out.     Now for my favorite part - the leave in creme. It is thick and soaks right into the dry ends of my hair. My hair felt fully saturated with moisture and I was worried that it would be very weighed down. The first time I tried it I styled my hair wavy, and it looked better than usual - it did not weigh down my hair. The next time I styled it straight. I did notice that my hair feels like it has a very slight film over it - I&#x27;m guess that is how it works. This affects the texture of my hair to the touch slightly, and doesn&#x27;t really bother me. I would say that my hair looked better than usual when styled - both when curly and straight.     Now for what you really want to know - did it fix my split ends??? I would say that at least 50% of my split ends disappeared after the first use. I don&#x27;t even know how that is possible, but they are gone. I still have some - but I have to search for them instead of seeing tons of them every time I look. So it does what it says it does - gets rid of split ends - and it left my hair feeling moisterized and less frizzy.</li>
    <li> Updated October 2016: after using several bottles of this product my last order for it was a few years back, when it was under $10. Currently at close to $30 it may be a bit too pricey, I switched to another product I could find locally, but if the price is right i would still use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had gone for about 6 months without cutting my hair at all....and it was starting to really look like it! I have long hair that is not particularily thick, but I have a lot of it, if that makes any sense. My ends were in dire need of some TLC. I was using a deep conditioning treatment in the shower previous to this which I think helped, but, clearly not enough. I purchased this along with Nexxus Promend Mousse and Heat Protecting Styling Spray. I had been using the mousse and spray for about a month before I added this to the regimen, and was having great results with just those two products. This was icing on the cake; I really saw a big improvement in my split ends and overall health of my hair after adding it. I would recommend all three products, but if I had to pick just one, I would say this is the one to buy. It is far less expensive than the other products I have used for this issue, and lasts a very long time (especially if you don&#x27;t shower everyday, I only use it on wet hair after cleansing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At about 6.5 months between trims, I finally went to my hairdresser and she said my hair was in great shape despite the length of time that had passed. She trimmed less than an inch, and previously, I usually would need about 3 inches taken off to get rid of all the damaged ends. So, if you are trying to grow your hair longer or just keep long hair long and healthy, this may be something to try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this it mad my hair feel sticky .. or yuck!!!  I Love the smell but the product stinks</li>
    <li> This stuff works really good. Hair is so much softer and smoother!  I will definately buy this again, well worth it.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Recommend it.  Cuts down in the number of split ends.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do. It binds your split ends beautifully. There is one word of caution though. I have very fine hair. If you use too much of this product, it tends to make your hair somewhat \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; and your brush will start dragging. This causes your hair to actually break off. For those of you with fine hair, the effect is similar to most thickening products. I have found that if I use the recommended amount on my very long hair, I don&#x27;t have this problem, so start with less rather than more and you should be fine.</li>
    <li> I like this product allot, do not know why the manufacturer discontinued it but I&#x27;m happy to still be able to buy it thru your online store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this creme for over a year. It makes your hair look healthy and shiny.</li>
    <li> This Leave in treatmeant has worked great for me, it has made my hair a bit stronger and it makes it much more manageable after I get out of the shower.</li>
    <li> Loved this stuff a few years ago. It did amazing things for my hair. It felt like I just got a fresh haircut everytime I used it but....There may be a new formula because it doesn&#x27;t preform like it use to. I will use up this bottle then explore new options. I believe it&#x27;s discontinued now anyway, I couldnt find it in any stores.</li>
    <li> I permed my hair in August 2011 thinking I might go for that look rather than messing with my hair each day, but unfortunately couldn&#x27;t stand the look, so I reverted back to heat styling. Needless to say, my hair has taken a beating for the past several months. I tried to preserve it, but I just didn&#x27;t have any luck. When I saw this line on sale at Costco, I took two sets because I had read such good things about it. I washed my hair with the shampoo which felt nice and moisturizing. I followed up with the very thick conditioner, which also seemed like it might be promising. I also tried the leave in included. When my hair dried, I was a bit dismayed....my hair felt like straw. I figured it might change after I flat ironed the next day, but it was still stiff. To make things worse, every time I touched my hair, I got a sticky residue on my hand. It appears that this is how this product works. Another reviewer likened the conditioner  to glue. I have to agree. Also, I tried not using the leave in to see if that would help...it didn&#x27;t. My hair was still sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all know that no shampoo, conditioner, or leave in is going to get rid of split ends, but rather just reduce the appearance of the split ends. I did not have this luck with most of the Nexxus Pro-Mend Line. I gave it a few days, then returned both sets when I didn&#x27;t see any visible improvement in my hair to justify the sticky feeling. I will say that I do have some Pro-Mend Heat Protexx heat protectant that I purchased before I bought the rest of this line, and it is great. Nice, light weight, and leaves no sticky residue. I will continue to use that. Just not the shampoo, conditioner, or leave in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, it is best to get a hair cut if your hair is in bad condition, but as in my case, sometimes it just isn&#x27;t practical. My bangs are badly damaged at the ends due to the perm and the fact that I hit this part of my hair hardest with the flat iron, but I just can&#x27;t go much shorter. Ifyou are looking for something that reduces the appearance of split ends, you might try Nexxus Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor (Different from Nexxus Emergencee, I like Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor better). I used it just last night and it has done a stellar job at reducing the appearance of split ends in my bangs. Dare I say, a stellar job? I believe it fused most of them together as it appears today that they are more or less gone. I know they are still there, but I can&#x27;t see them. It is awesome. This is exactly what Pro-Mend was supposed to do, except the Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling sticky.</li>
    <li> I put this product on the ends of my hair after washing it. It works very well for me. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome and gives good body. It also protects my hair from curling iron</li>
    <li> Good hair product, it is getting harder to find in stores</li>
    <li> product came very quickly and i was very happy to be using it the ifist day it came in, it is great for your hair and makes it feel like silk.</li>
    <li> In two days my ends look better</li>
    <li> Not as good as when it first came out! Must have changed the formula. Did absolutely nothing!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t thing it works. I&#x27;m still using it, and hoping for some results.  I haven&#x27;t really seen an improvement  yet, but it does help with the tangles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bleached my hair like crazy, color currently copper. It was doing great things for my hair until my hair got too used to the product. But it is MUCH better than how my hair was. Would recommend buying shampoo and/or conditioner as well.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many hair products in this product will works fantastic .  I highly recommend this product for your hair.</li>
    <li> dude this s*** works..i have horrible split ends and lots of them..my hair looks nice for the most part however the ends are frizzy be nature cuz the split ends(cuz im afraid to cut it) well i used this and couldnt even find a split end..its a miracle lol and way cheaper on amazon then at cvs which is odd..highly recommend to ppl who have dry frizzy ends</li>
    <li> From what I think this product is awesome but I didn&#x27;t have the chance to get it they didn&#x27;t allow it on the airplane so we threw it.</li>
    <li> Great product to make your hair look healthier and shinier. It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily look like most leave in treatments.</li>
    <li> This has been the only hair product that I have found that has helped my dry hair become soft!  It has made my coarse hair feel softer, and I didn&#x27;t believe anything could have done that.  I use this product everyday.</li>
    <li> This dried my ends out so bad that it looks worse than before putting this on my hair.</li>
    <li> been using this creme for 3 months and NO SPLIT ENDS SO FAR !!!! I&#x27;ve always had split ends especially during fall and winter but now I JUST DON&amp;#34;T HAVE THEM !!</li>
    <li> My hair is thin and frizzy and i bought this a year ago. Apparently i left it at my parents house when visiting, and forgot about it. Now 8 months later i am visiting and found this in the closet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ( i had tried letting my hair go natural as so many brown women are doing these days, but had to revert back to a perm because my hair was not manageable when the weather got humid, and my hairstyles looked like helmet head.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so visiting my parents i used this product and was so excited. IMMEDIATE NOTICEABLE difference. My hair had the shine and control  like the beautiful women we see in the magazines and on the internet. i had used the plastic rollers and took them out early and my hair air dried but had beautiful soft curls. my hair is so thin i have to wash it every day which takes a toll on it. with this product i didn&#x27;t have to wash my hair the next day. just rolled it again and let the shower steam do it&#x27;s trick. i&#x27;m glad i re-discovered this product. if it stops working ladies and you lose the wow factor, just switch to something else for a week and then switch back. this worked for me with the Nexxus humectrus line of shampoos and conditioners. It&#x27;s like Wow, i love my hair again.</li>
    <li> I have dry hair and this product helps prevent split ends and seems to make my hair look healthier and nicer!</li>
    <li> This is really good hair treatment and it is easy to use.  We really love it.  It has gotten hard to find so we were glad we could get it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> It leaves my hair feeling stiff and dry. Especially where the split ends are. But I&#x27;ve only used it once and I have noticed less shedding. Hopefully my hair reacts better to it with continued use.</li>
    <li> I have hair that is so frizzy and dry it looks like a just walked in from the wild. I followed the direction and applied this to the areas that are the worst and then combed it through the rest of my hair. Oh my gosh!! It is unreal, my hair has never looked as tame as is does today. I am completely sold on this, It worked so well for me. Again I have thick, dry, and frizzy hair. I don&#x27;t use any products on my hair except Nexxus shampoo and conditioner so I have no idea what the restrictions are for coloring, perms, and so on. :)</li>
    <li> Living in a very humid state, this creme tames the frizz but leaves my hair touchably soft. Love love love it!!!</li>
    <li> It worked great for my hair, it actually heals the split ends. The only thing is it works better when your hair is wet, and you still have to be careful about heating your hair too much. For only $8 it was a great deal specially because you find it in beauty supply stores for way more. It is great alms  like hair glue, it binds the ends. As someone who bleach their hair twice it was a good product. Plus i like the smell a lot.</li>
    <li> The cap was opened and spilled out upon arrival. The item packaging was sealed though</li>
    <li> I started using this because my sister suggested it, and I thought, &amp;#34;oh my gosh, it&#x27;s SO expensive!&amp;#34; but I tried it out just the same because I didn&#x27;t want to be rude. I honestly didn&#x27;t expect much. In the 6 months I&#x27;ve been using it, my slow-growing hair has gained more length than it did the last few years. I&#x27;ve finally gotten it almost to my waist, and my split ends are GONE. I have floofy, princess-like (my hubby says) hair, so split ends are normally very commonplace for me. It smells good, and my hair is softer and so much prettier. I can&#x27;t believe how great this stuff actually works! Now if they could make it a bit cheaper, that&#x27;d be great. . .</li>
    <li> Love this product, makes your hairs so soft and it really reduces the breakage as well as split-ends. I recommend this product</li>
    <li> I have very long hair (to my waist) and it&#x27;s very hard to keep the split ends at bay due to a couple factors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I live in a dry climate with very hard water. It pretty much strips my hair and is not helpful at all to keeping it moisturized and healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;2. I&#x27;m over 35 and I&#x27;ve experienced some changes to the texture of my hair in the last 5 years or so. I&#x27;m battling &#x27;father time&#x27; in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;3. I&#x27;m not able to get my hair trimmed as often as I&#x27;d like to keep the split ends at bay. I work and have kiddos and all the other things one does in life, and it seems every time I try to make an appointment for a trim...someone else needs a check-up, or new glasses, or money for a field trip...ya know, the normal stuff. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using Nexxus moisturizing shampoo and conditioner and was LOVING the results I was getting, but I wanted to see if some of Nexxus&#x27; other products could do more, make my hair healthy, youthful looking, and soft once again. I tried the moisturizer spray and that really helped with getting my brush through my tangled nest of hair after my showers which helped stop some breakage. Then I found the split end binder and thought AH-HA, this is what I need. I started applying this to my hair after I towel dried my hair from the shower, and then sprayed my moisturizing spray on top of that. Putting my brush through my hair after that first time was a pleasure! No tangling mats, no pulling, pinching, or major breakage. It was able to brush out my hair quickly (something that really surprised me given how MUCH hair I actually have). My hair is noticeably more healthy looking, softer, and so shiny! I love Nexxus products! I am in heaven with this stuff....it&#x27;s just awesome. I finally found something that put life back into my poor dried out damaged hair! I get compliments on my hair a lot lately and I know it&#x27;s due to the results I&#x27;ve gotten using Nexxus products.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly never thought I&#x27;d be faithful to a &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; of products like this. I&#x27;ve always had a hodge-podge of things- a conditioner from this company, a shampoo from that company, a hot oil treatment here, and a detangler there. These products really do work well together to give you the best results possible. Even after I&#x27;ve had my hair colored it can bounce back quickly and look great just using these products with my next shower.&lt;br /&gt;The cream goes a long way so you don&#x27;t have to use more than a nickel to quarter sized amount (one to one and a half pumps). It goes in smoothly and has a very pleasant scent that doesn&#x27;t clash with the scents of their other products. LOVE this stuff!34;brand&amp;#34; of products like this.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a product that would assist me in de-frizzing my 40-something, color treated, medium length hair which I blow dry and flat-iron daily.  I stumbled across this Nexxus ProMend treatment creme at a local discount store.  Using [[ASIN:B0009I4JLE Nexxus Botanoil  Treatment Shampoo 5 Ounces]] prior to using this product, I noted a substantial improvement in my hair&#x27;s shine, softness and manageability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thick and wavy, and now with the introduction of 30-40% gray hair over the past year or so, it&#x27;s tough to keep it looking nice and frizz-free.  I&#x27;ve tried way too many products that promise results but seem to be lacking.  The Nexxus ProMend seems to be the difference in this combination I&#x27;ve tried.  Using it with other shampoos it also calms the frizzy look, although for me, I seem to need a moisturizing shampoo no matter what I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nexxus ProMend also makes a leave-in overnight conditioner.  The rest of the products in the line can be tried in one package: [[ASIN:B0082PLTYQ Nexxus Pro Mend Shampoo, Conditioner, Bonus Leave-in Treatment]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold on this product&#x27;s effectiveness on my hair to eliminate split-ends (aka: fuzzies).  I also think it strengthens the hair and leaves it shiny.  In the future I plan on using the whole ProMend line to keep my hair looking its best.</li>
    <li> This cream works pretty well at keeping your split ends under control. I apply it on damp hair after I&#x27;ve applied Enjoy shine serum. It&#x27;s important that you only apply it to the ends as it is a heavy cream that can leave your hair stiff if you use too much. This would be a 5 star review if it wasn&#x27;t for the stiffness. I&#x27;ve noticed the stiffness is more pronounced if I let my hair air dry vs. blow dry. It&#x27;s still a great product that I would both buy again and recommend it to others. It definitely allows me to go longer between salon visits; considering I spend $110 on my hair cut/highlights before a tip that is a huge plus.</li>
    <li> Yesterday, my sister took me to get this at Target. She said it works really well and I&#x27;d definetly see a difference. And she was sooo right! I only used this ONCE and almost all of my split ends disappeared. I literally have to search to find one. AMAZING! I love it and will definitely keep using it. THANKS NEXXUS YOU ROCK!</li>
    <li> Smells nice but doesn&#x27;t give me the wow my hair is fabulous feeling like other reviews promised.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, when I grabbed this off of the shelf at Wal-mart. Firstly, because it&#x27;s a feature on a Wal-mart shelf...how much of a quality treatment could it be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I was proven wrong. No, it&#x27;s no miracle fix. It&#x27;s science, but it really works. I could see a difference from the first time I used it. I dye my hair fairly often and it gets very dry and splits. This reverses the damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great, too! : )</li>
    <li> I have used the shampoo, conditioner, and leave in. I have waist length color treated hair and was very pleased with the results it left my hair smooth, sleek, and shiny but after the first day my hair felt weighed down and dirty. After testing all kinds of products I am very pleased with this one even if it means washing my hair every other day. The results are well worth the inconvenience.</li>
    <li> Love Amazon and great product!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, but a little pricey.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it. The smell is too sweet and It made my hair sticky.</li>
    <li> I really love this hair product. I am trying to grow my hair out and have actually been able to skip a few haircuts. I have highlighted hair that I use lots of heat on to straighten daily.  I have actually been able to go to every other cuts with my coloring sessions. Has helped me grow my hair out.</li>
    <li> My ends are always like straw. Almost immediately after a cut the bottom couple inches of my hair go to hell. This is due to my toddler constantly playing with it, naturally brittle hair, and probably not enough brushing (whoops).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is GREAT. It really does seal your ends better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. It helps with detangling, and once my I blow dry my hair (without using any other products), my ends feel so sleek and soft it&#x27;s almost like I just had a trim. This allows me to go much, much longer between cuts. I try to get it cut consistently anyway, but I&#x27;m pretty bad about it. This has been a life-safer. You really don&#x27;t need much, either. It recommends a nickel-sized amount, which is about right for my medium-length super thin hair.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser here in Brazil loves this product. When i travel to the USA she always ask me to take 2 or 3 bottles for her. So, to split ends Nexxus is the best.</li>
    <li> Best ever leavein conditioner!! Your hair will thank you for it!! Highly recommend buying very inexpensive plus a great product!!</li>
    <li> Made my ussually soft hair feel like straw.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing and smells good too. I have been using it for a long time and it keeps my hair looking and feeling its best. A better buy here than anywhere else I have found.</li>
    <li> Ok, I saw a commercial for the new nexxus pro mend line and I immediately ordered the entire line online.  I was of course very skeptical but was willing to try it out.  I had been growing my hair out and hadn&#x27;t had a haircut for over a year.  I was holding out until I could get my hair cut and permed at a really good salon.  Well of course as a result I had a lot of split ends.  I used the shampoo, conditioner, leave in conditioner and weekly intensive repair and . . . .  I couldn&#x27;t believe it-- NO SPLIT ENDS!  THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS!  It is amazing!  After just one use the vast majority of my split ends were gone!  I honestly had to search to find some.  My hair also felt much smoother and silkier.  I know I sound like a TV commercial but it&#x27;s true.  I highly rec this product for anyone looking to improve their hair texture and get rid of their split ends.  It&#x27;s obviously not a permanent solution like getting a trim but for those trying to grow out their hair it&#x27;s a definite must.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Makes my hair feel soft.  Not sure it is really mending split ends, though.  I just like using a light leave in conditioner instead of a cream rinse.</li>
    <li> Normally I love all products Nexxus (most especially Emergencee); however, this product left my hair feeling weighted down. At first, I thought I was using too much so instead of using a nickel-sized amount I decreased to about dime-sized but still my hair was weighted down. Moreover, the product also made my hair dull and took away its natural sheen. That said, this could be related to the fact that my hair is on the thin side.</li>
    <li> Now for me this did work...I love leaveins, so this one works and I have ordered it again.  My hair has fewer split ends so I will continue to use it but wish the price was a little cheaper, but all in all worth it.</li>
    <li> makes your hair feel soft</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair that tends to frizz. I&#x27;ve tried many products over many years, but this stuff just seems to work. I got the best deal here on Amazon. I&#x27;m pretty sure the company offered free shipping. So, it was cheaper than my local Target. Compared to the price of all these products that are supposed to smooth frizzy hair, it&#x27;s the deal of the century. Mind you, it is not going to completely smooth your hair, and it certainly won&#x27;t straighten it. Embrace your curls and use ProMend Leavein Treatment to soften them.</li>
    <li> i loved this product it really helped with my split ends and the bottle size is good too not too small</li>
    <li> I love it. You should get one!</li>
    <li> Very good for my hair in the  summertime humidity</li>
    <li> Been useing this for a long time.  I love it and use it in lieu of styling gels or creams...</li>
    <li> I had bleached my hair, dyed it black. I bleached it blonde again, and dyed it black again. And bleached it one more time and now its dark again. This was all in a two year span. But this last time killed my hair. I got out of the shower and hair was breaking of to the touch. My hair is well past my shoulders, and I was contemplating chopping it off. I decided To try this, and let me tell you, I am amazed! I don&#x27;t have to cut my hair after all! I&#x27;m so freakin happy! It does weigh it down but that&#x27;s good in my case! I say if you have healthy hair you may not need this that much, but if you  screwed up like I have then you should definitely try this product!! :D hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this treatment for my hair!  It makes it manageable, gives it shine and the conditioning it needs.  I use this daily and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy either.  Would certainly recommend this product to anyone! A+</li>
    <li> Smells delicious and I like to believe it works. It really feels like improvement is happening.</li>
    <li> I received the &amp;#34;Straightening Cream&amp;#34;  The bottle is grey and the top is BLUE. I thought I&#x27;d give it a try but I&#x27;m tired of getting screwed over by Amazon retailers.</li>
    <li> This creme smells nice and did good in my hair, I may buy again, but it did not make a wow difference.</li>
    <li> This product worked well on my relaxed hair until I realized that one of the ingredients is Sodium Hydroxide! (yes! one of the main components in hair relaxers!). Although I assume it must be a small fraction compared to the amount found on relaxers: A leave in treatment??!!!! Seriously????? Goodbye Nexxus!!!!</li>
    <li> My hair is waist length and wavy at the top, more curly toward the bottom and while I don&#x27;t use chemicals such as dye in my hair or heat style it on a regular basis, because of the length of my hair I do have a lot of split ends. Also, the ends of my hair feel very dry and straw like if I don&#x27;t put any product in them. I usually use drug store products such as Herbal Essences leave in cream and Organix shampoo and conditioner. I received a sample of this product from Nexxus and I was excited to try a \\&quot;higher end\\&quot; product. I would have been willing to purchase it if it had done even close to what was touted, but it did not. I also received a sample of the shampoo and conditioner in this line as well. After shampooing and conditioning with the Nexxus products and applying this leave in, I let my hair air dry as I usually do. Once my hair was dry, it was frizzier than ever! It felt dry and gross and I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in the ends at all. My hair looked horrible. My drug store products work 100 times better at making my hair silky and shiny. The only thing good I could say about this product is that it smells fantastic. Other than that I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money.</li>
    <li> One of the Nexxus products that my wife had ordered for dry, damaged hair.  She said she liked it, that it worked okay but thinks the products are too expensive for what they are.  She didn&#x27;t care for the ProMend shampoo at all, and the leavein treatment was better than the rinse out conditioner.  Overall, she said buying the Nexxus products she needed was an expensive experiment and just doesn&#x27;t think they were worth the money they cost.</li>
    <li> I pick at my split ends constantly, so I need a good fix. Not much of a difference when used on is own, but I have seen a noticeable improvement after using this and the conditioner together. I wash my hair every other day, and results are best the first day, with more visible ends on the second day. Using the cream in between washes seems to help a bit.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT!!!  Repairs split ends after each wash and makes my hair look much more full!</li>
    <li> It is a good hair product, but kind of expensive for such a small bottle.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this for my dry ends. The smell is great and it really does moisturize your ends. Obviously a split end can&#x27;t actually be mended together but it definitely makes them feel smoother and look healthier</li>
    <li> I add this to the ends of my hair after a shower before I add anything else. It seems to help stretch the length of my haircut as my ends aren&#x27;t a mess and creates the illusion of more volume for my fine hair.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really make that much difference!</li>
    <li> I have used this at least 2 years, probably longer but I&#x27;m not sure, and will keep using it unless discontinued or they change the formula for the worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair:  I have somewhat fine hair that tends to be staticky and get awful split ends.  I also don&#x27;t get regular trims when my hair is longer, so the split ends can get very bad.  The only other ProMend product I ever use is the Heat Protection spray occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use:  1 full pump at most, which is less than the nickel-sized amount recommended.  I put it all on the last 3-4 inches of my hair, then comb any left on my hands through the rest of my hair except the very top and front, then I usually wait a few minutes to brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How it works on my hair:  Helps with split ends, I can easily go 6 months without a trim before my hair starts looking ratty.  The only somewhat negative is that if I don&#x27;t use it for a while, it is less good at FIXING split ends than PREVENTING new ones.  It does help with existing split ends, just not 100% back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;It is good as a detangler, so less hair snags and breaks.&lt;br /&gt;It helps a little bit with fly-aways.&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels a little softer.&lt;br /&gt;No problems on color-treated hair.  Even when I had crazy bright colors like blue that are obvious when they fade, it did not fade the ends any faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main negative reviews I see are that it is sticky and weighs down your hair or makes it dull.  I have never had any of that happen so I recommend giving it another shot with much less product.</li>
    <li> It smells great and it actually leaves my hair softer and more manageable. And after going natural it leaves my hair feeling light and smooth.</li>
    <li> I use this among many others supplies for my extremely dead hair. I have the overnight cream, shampoo and conditioner also. My hair is slowly starting to get healthy again but I use different brands of shampoos and conditioners also so I can&#x27;t really tell how each product works individually.</li>
    <li> I love Nexxus hair products, I trimmed my ends and i am using it every day to keep to keep them looking good</li>
    <li> Not sure if it works. Makes hair feel a bit stiff and sticky after application.</li>
    <li> I used this leave-in every day. It smells great and leaves my damaged hair looking shiny and feeling soft. My hair is also very fine and this product does not weigh it down or make it look greasy. I Iove this stuff!</li>
    <li> I starting using this after I depleted the product my hair stylist sold to me. Who puts wax in their hair, anyway. I grabbed this off my wife&#x27;s vanity and used it. I probably should have read the label before using it, but I was running late. I hardly noticed the scent after a few hours. I does work well prior to blow-drying my hair. BTW -  I didn&#x27;t even realize that I had split ends.</li>
    <li> It smoothes my ends really well,  I just don&#x27;t like the film it leaves on my hair.</li>
    <li> I have very very long hair and I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now and it does make the ends of my hair thicker and fuller..</li>
    <li> I bought this more to protect my ends, and boy does it ever deliver. My hair just looks so much nicer and less poufy than it used to. If you have a split ends/dry hair/frizz issue, this stuff is great.</li>
