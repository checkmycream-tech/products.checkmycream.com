      <li>liked the great great price of this product.</li>
      <li>and this was a good one to darken the hair</li>
      <li>I really loved the magenta, but it was getting too bright for my taste.</li>
      <li>Do your own strand tests, but my guess is blondes would get bright orange, orange hair would probably deepen/darken, and</li>
      <li>I had been talking to someone from their company on their website, and they were so nice in helping me get more info!</li>
      <li>Great color depth and accurate color guide.</li>
      <li>it does look really nice</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still a nice color on me</li>
      <li>Each person will have their own results.</li>
      <li>wish it didnt bleed quite as much as it does but all in all great!</li>
      <li>It really shines beautifully!</li>
      <li>It is very easy to mix -just add warm water.  </li>
      <li>this gave me auburn, with very bright roots for the first couple of days.</li>
      <li>So far, so very good!</li>
      <li>I liked that this product did color my most of my greys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nonetheless, it was wonderful just using the dye as it makes your hair feel so lovely and soft; it&#x27;s like a hairdye, shampoo and conditioner rolled into one!</li>
      <li>Great quality henna and color, but takes too much time to be effective.</li>
      <li>Harvest Moon is pure and organic and great on my hair.</li>
      <li>Will use this product many more times.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll have to judge for yourself when it&#x27;s mostly rinsed out.</li>
      <li>You can use this henna as many times/as often as you want without hurting your hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve stopped short of saying this product is excellent as this is the first time I&#x27;ve used it</li>
      <li>Henna is one exact plant, which contains one exact dye: bright orange.</li>
      <li>I have used many different brands of henna, and this one is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>light brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good product so far.</li>
      <li>really do recommend this company and henna!!!</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite color!</li>
      <li>I decided to try this brand because I read several good reviews.</li>
      <li>There are many kinds of henna, and this is one of the real ones.  </li>
      <li>I also love how much healthier my hair has become.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard that rosemary essential oil is supposed to be good for the hair...</li>
      <li>It was quick and in a hurry.</li>
      <li>A bit messy but the color turned out beautiful.</li>
      <li>And I would use organic apple cider vinegar (ACV) or spray it the hair with it before coloring for better results and you get really vivid colors.</li>
      <li>When i used this, my hair was an amazing red color; i was so excited.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
      <li>Well I just dyed my hair last night and it looks amazing</li>
      <li>it came out to give me a nice red glossy shine in the sun.</li>
      <li>It could just have been the brands/colors I used, so definitely do a strand test of your own whenever you switch dyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also suggest you purchase and mix in some essential oil that gives the henna a nice aroma...</li>
      <li>but I think thats true of any pure henna product).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a warm, orangy color, like straight henna only darker.</li>
      <li>Very much a product I will continue to use.  </li>
      <li>- was going for a more fire red color.</li>
      <li>Anyway, I will probably try more of their shades as well in the future.</li>
      <li>Some websites state that theirs in the only authentic henna; and that is bunk.  </li>
      <li>i admit it wasnt the EXACT color i wanted</li>
      <li>Your hair will get darker and more orange only, but it will never be damaged.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon for having almost everything!</li>
      <li>Love using henna to cover my grey and the price is right.</li>
      <li>Yes, a little red tint washes out at first, but once the color oxidizes after a day or two it looks incredible</li>
      <li>I was worried when I applied it, as it looked VERY orange (like regular henna) on my head, but the color came out more burgundy-ish.</li>
      <li>Pretty good and my only complaint is that the &amp;#34;burgundy&amp;#34; is more of an auburn.</li>
      <li>Also, I&#x27;d like to see if the product lives up to all the positive comments it&#x27;s received about improving the condition of ones hair.</li>
      <li>almost always contain some kind of bleach, which is why you can use them to go down to a lighter shade, but it&#x27;s also why they&#x27;re so damaging.</li>
      <li>This is indeed pure, real henna.  </li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t like how fast it faded and how it faded to orange within three weeks.</li>
      <li>Henna is so much safer than those chemical dyes.</li>
      <li>i put absolutely nothing in my hair because i was scared the color would come out.</li>
      <li>After one hour, the color is vibrant and VERY shiny.</li>
      <li>If you can, apply this in a basement or even your back yard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;no metallic salts&amp;#34; claim seems to be true.</li>
      <li>I know the color will deepen over the next few days but the color is already so rich and a beautiful deep red color (without any brassiness) on day one!</li>
      <li>would use this product again if I was short on cash and needed a quick color-up.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m going to go over it with the deep red several more times to build more the red</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an African-Caribbean woman and like the vibrant colour this Henna dye gives me.</li>
      <li>(mine was a pretty faded/damaged light red from using a lot of red chemical dyes).</li>
      <li>The only thing I was left with was orange hands (although I wore gloves the whole time, because you cant shampoo it out, a layer of orange-brown stain remains) and a hint of burgundy when I hit the right angle of light, also the colour bled when I finally washed it.</li>
      <li>Also, I only had to leave this on for about 2 hours when I used to leave the other on for 4 hours or more.</li>
      <li>I have only positive things to say about the product.  </li>
      <li>a huge mess to use and cleanup was a horror,,</li>
      <li>Long story short, I think this is just for light haired individuals, I gave it two stars because the henna made my hair really soft and curly.</li>
      <li>I have been dying my hair with henna for about a year now because I no longer wanted to use harsh and damaging chemicals on my already baby fine hair.</li>
      <li>The instructions will say to rinse it out until the water is clear, but that will never happen.</li>
      <li>The product never rinsed out to clear water as the instructions implied it would after application</li>
      <li>I have cancer, and that it vital for me.  </li>
      <li>I plan to wait another week to let the color completely deepen then decide if I want to stay with it.</li>
      <li>I get a natural look.</li>
      <li>Buy some rubber gloves, and put petroleum jelly on your face near the hairline (but don&#x27;t get it in your hair).</li>
      <li>First tried a strand test with this color and it was a deep purple-ish wine red, but decided I had too much gray to go quite this deep a shade.</li>
      <li>I have short hair so the 1 pkg I purchased will last me 3 applications and the price is very reasonable.  </li>
      <li>now my hair is back to my normal color;</li>
      <li>To get auburn (or burgundy), they had to add other, darker dyes which are less famous than henna.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m going to try some other brands of plant-based burgundy first to see if any of them are the shade I was after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So I mixed this color with their Deep Red and got lovely deep red-auburn results without the typical henna orange undertone.</li>
      <li>But when I first used it, I had blondish hair and it turned my hair orangish/red, so not best with light hair.</li>
      <li>The color will turn slightly darker after the first day or two.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have never had any other henna bleed as much as this brand does.</li>
      <li>It is also easy to use because you apply it on wet hair, not on dry hair, like other henna products which I have used.  </li>
      <li>I have dark hair that I have been coloring &amp;#34;Dark Cherry Brown&amp;#34; for a couple years now with chemical dye, and this color came very close to it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using henna in my hair for some time, because before I hated the costs of those chemical hair dyes and how much damage it did to my hair. I luv this dark red color and goes well with my now brown hair. But when I first used it, I had blondish hair and it turned my hair orangish/red, so not best with light hair. When get this, it wont come with the kit, like the basic latex gloves or brush, so that is separate. Henna is so much safer than those chemical dyes.</li>
    <li> Ever since I was a teen I have used boxed hair dyes from the stores and now at 40 my hair has paid the price of all the chemicals.  After researching the benefits of henna I decided to try it out and I&#x27;m completley amazed at the results.  The Harvest Moon Burgundy is a wonderful product. I have short hair so the 1 pkg I purchased will last me 3 applications and the price is very reasonable.  I also love how much healthier my hair has become.  I&#x27;m losing less hair and noticing my hair getting thicker which means new growth because I&#x27;m not killing my hair with all the toxic chemicals in the store brought brands.  My hair is shinier and the color has remained in my hair which is not the case with boxed dyes where reds do not seem to remain permenant in my hair.  I will definately continue to use this product in the future.  I also suggest you purchase and mix in some essential oil that gives the henna a nice aroma...I&#x27;ve heard that rosemary essential oil is supposed to be good for the hair...</li>
    <li> A very good product.  I&#x27;ve stopped short of saying this product is excellent as this is the first time I&#x27;ve used it and I want to see how long the colour lasts for. Also, I&#x27;d like to see if the product lives up to all the positive comments it&#x27;s received about improving the condition of ones hair. Nonetheless, it was wonderful just using the dye as it makes your hair feel so lovely and soft; it&#x27;s like a hairdye, shampoo and conditioner rolled into one! I&#x27;m an African-Caribbean woman and like the vibrant colour this Henna dye gives me. So far, so very good!</li>
    <li> I have been dying my hair with henna for about a year now because I no longer wanted to use harsh and damaging chemicals on my already baby fine hair. I had been using Rainbow henna but was not completely pleased with the color (even when I tried mixing several colors together) or how clumpy the product was during application. I decided to try this brand because I read several good reviews. Well I just dyed my hair last night and it looks amazing and it was a lot easier to apply than Rainbow (not nearly as clumpy and a lot smoother - still messy but I think thats true of any pure henna product). I know the color will deepen over the next few days but the color is already so rich and a beautiful deep red color (without any brassiness) on day one! I&#x27;ve already received a ton of compliments about the color! Also, I only had to leave this on for about 2 hours when I used to leave the other on for 4 hours or more. And their color never came out this nice! Will definitely buy again!!</li>
    <li> i bought this a few weeks ago and i have to say my hair is soooo soft now! i admit it wasnt the EXACT color i wanted but because i have naturally dark hair what did i expect. it came out to give me a nice red glossy shine in the sun. it does look really nice so i will buy again once my roots come in. my hair grows slow so thankfully i wont have to retouch up for a few months. All in all it was a great purchase. no chemicals, so my scalp didnt burn at all in the process, just left it in for 2 hours and washed off. I do have to say that when i went to a pool, the chlorine in the pool made it a little lighter so beware of that, i like it but others might not.</li>
    <li> This arrived just as i expected. It was quick and in a hurry. Once i figured out that there was quality henna that does the same thing if not better for 1.99, i probably wont be buying this expensive stuff on here..unless im desperate of course. No offense to the sellers though..great people and product, i just want to buy cheaper.</li>
    <li> When i used this, my hair was an amazing red color; i was so excited.&lt;br /&gt;but when i washed it the color of the water turned orange. . every single time. now my hair is no longer red. the color washed out after a week. now my hair is back to my normal color; light brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it was very disappointing. they say that henna is impossible to remove. . but i guess this henna sucks. because it got removed after a week without me even trying to remove it! i avoided leave in conditioners or oils. i put absolutely nothing in my hair because i was scared the color would come out. and it still did. not to mention turn my pillow orange every time i took a shower and slept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very disappointed. i will no longer buy this henna product</li>
    <li> Very much a product I will continue to use.  Thanks Amazon for having almost everything!</li>
    <li> The color quality is very nice. The product never rinsed out to clear water as the instructions implied it would after application and it continues to bleed color when my hair is washed.</li>
    <li> To start off, I have naturally black hair, so when I bought this item I expected my hair colour to change, not so much like the picture the seller has up, but something similar. I followed the instructions, being a fan of henna I was already accustomed to the smell, then washed it out. The instructions stated that you must rinse out the henna without shampooing until two days later for the colour to work its way in. The only thing I was left with was orange hands (although I wore gloves the whole time, because you cant shampoo it out, a layer of orange-brown stain remains) and a hint of burgundy when I hit the right angle of light, also the colour bled when I finally washed it. Long story short, I think this is just for light haired individuals, I gave it two stars because the henna made my hair really soft and curly.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite color! wish it didnt bleed quite as much as it does but all in all great!</li>
    <li> I have used many different brands of henna, and this one is by far the best.  It is very easy to mix -just add warm water.  It is also easy to use because you apply it on wet hair, not on dry hair, like other henna products which I have used.  Another bonus, you only leave it on for one hour, vs. the 2+ hours or overnight application required by other henna products.  After one hour, the color is vibrant and VERY shiny.</li>
    <li> Great quality henna and color, but takes too much time to be effective. I usually would sleep with it wrapped for full color binding, however, uncomfortable. And I would use organic apple cider vinegar (ACV) or spray it the hair with it before coloring for better results and you get really vivid colors. It really shines beautifully!</li>
    <li> I have dark hair that I have been coloring &amp;#34;Dark Cherry Brown&amp;#34; for a couple years now with chemical dye, and this color came very close to it. I was worried when I applied it, as it looked VERY orange (like regular henna) on my head, but the color came out more burgundy-ish. My only complaint is how long the color bleeds. I used this 2 weeks ago and I am still bleeding orange when my hair is wet. I went to water park this past weekend and it looked like I was leaking Tang all over my back and shoulders. I have never had any other henna bleed as much as this brand does. I plan to wait another week to let the color completely deepen then decide if I want to stay with it.</li>
    <li> First tried a strand test with this color and it was a deep purple-ish wine red, but decided I had too much gray to go quite this deep a shade. So I mixed this color with their Deep Red and got lovely deep red-auburn results without the typical henna orange undertone. (Probably the amount of Indigo in this shade is what balanced out the henna orange.) Anyway, I will probably try more of their shades as well in the future. Good product so far.</li>
    <li> A bit messy but the color turned out beautiful.</li>
    <li> I have been exclusively using Henna Hut&#x27;s henna to color my hair for a long time now.  I have only positive things to say about the product.  It conditions, makes the hair glossy and it helps the hair have body.  For those who think it might be expensive; have you inquired what it would cost to have hair colored at a salon?  With Henna Hut, you can do it yourself faster, easier, cheaper, and you aren&#x27;t risking your health with noxious chemicals.  I have cancer, and that it vital for me.  I want to look good too, and this enables me to do so!  This is indeed pure, real henna.  Some websites state that theirs in the only authentic henna; and that is bunk.  There are many kinds of henna, and this is one of the real ones.  They have their ingredients listed on the package, so you needn&#x27;t fear.  Just follow the instructions to the letter and it will work for you.  Yes, a little red tint washes out at first, but once the color oxidizes after a day or two it looks incredible and it lasts!  Go for it- you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> no change of color on roots</li>
    <li> Brand and product lived up to it&#x27;s expectations. Read a lot of reviews about different brands of Henna. Henna Hut seems to be legit and their product was cheaper through Amazon. Harvest Moon is pure and organic and great on my hair. Great color depth and accurate color guide. Will use this product many more times. I prefer the Deep Red color over the burgundy... was a little too dark brown - was going for a more fire red color. However, I wanted to build the color saturation and this was a good one to darken the hair (mine was a pretty faded/damaged light red from using a lot of red chemical dyes). It still brought in some red but I&#x27;m going to go over it with the deep red several more times to build more the red I&#x27;m looking for. You can use this henna as many times/as often as you want without hurting your hair.</li>
    <li> THis product was harsh for my already dry climate and curly hair. Grey coverage is required for my needs, this product did that, however did not last long enough. With-in three weeks the color was fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the great great price of this product. I liked that this product did color my most of my greys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like how fast it faded and how it faded to orange within three weeks. Products used to wash and condition my hair are made for color treated hair and are mild.&lt;br /&gt;I would use this product again if I was short on cash and needed a quick color-up.</li>
    <li> Love using henna to cover my grey and the price is right. No chemicals and I get a natural look.</li>
    <li> Pretty good and my only complaint is that the &amp;#34;burgundy&amp;#34; is more of an auburn. It&#x27;s a warm, orangy color, like straight henna only darker. There are no cool purple/blue tones like with burgundy box dyes. It&#x27;s still a nice color on me and I may buy it again, but I&#x27;m going to try some other brands of plant-based burgundy first to see if any of them are the shade I was after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the review part of my review. Now I&#x27;m just going to infodump anything I think newbies might need to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice: I have hair down to my upper back, and found 100 grams to be just barely enough to dye it all twice. My hair bleeds orange when wet even a month after dying. If you are committed to white sheets, towels, pillow cases, and shirts, this is not going to work out for you. The instructions will say to rinse it out until the water is clear, but that will never happen. You&#x27;ll have to judge for yourself when it&#x27;s mostly rinsed out. Also, it will stain your skin. (Henna &amp;#34;tattoos&amp;#34; are literally just henna left on the skin for a few hours, after all.) Buy some rubber gloves, and put petroleum jelly on your face near the hairline (but don&#x27;t get it in your hair). If you find the dye impossible to work into your hair, you probably need to add another tablespoon or two of water to your mix. You WILL get dye all over. If you can, apply this in a basement or even your back yard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;no metallic salts&amp;#34; claim seems to be true. I used this both before and after a couple of box dyes. The bleaches in box dyes react badly with the metallic salts in some henna-based dyes, which is why you&#x27;re not supposed to chemically treat hair that&#x27;s had henna in it. I had no problems. It could just have been the brands/colors I used, so definitely do a strand test of your own whenever you switch dyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike with box dyes, you can leave this on your hair for as long as you want before you rinse it out. You may get a deeper color that way. Because it contains no form of bleach, it does nothing to damage your hair so there&#x27;s no hurry to get it out. But also, because there&#x27;s no form of bleach, YOU CANNOT LIGHTEN YOUR HAIR WITH HENNA. No amount of time will make you go from black to auburn. This is dye only, not bleach. And there is no such thing as a non-damaging bleach, because you necessarily have to damage your hair in order to make pigment come out of it. &amp;#34;Chemical&amp;#34; box dyes (you guys, everything is a chemical! even in nature!) almost always contain some kind of bleach, which is why you can use them to go down to a lighter shade, but it&#x27;s also why they&#x27;re so damaging. Not with henna. Your hair will get darker and more orange only, but it will never be damaged. tl;dr: bleaches are the opposite of dyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On previously-dyed medium brown hair this gave me auburn, with very bright roots for the first couple of days. Do your own strand tests, but my guess is blondes would get bright orange, orange hair would probably deepen/darken, and very dark hair (of any ethnicity) would just get a little warmer. I have no idea about grey hair, sorry. The color will turn slightly darker after the first day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since some reviewers seemed confused about this, no, it&#x27;s not pure henna. You can look up the ingredients on their site. Henna is one exact plant, which contains one exact dye: bright orange. To get auburn (or burgundy), they had to add other, darker dyes which are less famous than henna.</li>
    <li> I started out with dark blonde hair with a magenta that had washed out. I really loved the magenta, but it was getting too bright for my taste. I decided to switch to henna burgundy, but the result was orange. I looked like Vitamin C in that video &amp;#34;Smile&amp;#34; and it was really uneven. I had been talking to someone from their company on their website, and they were so nice in helping me get more info! They said they would send me some brown because at that point I was fed up with trying to achieve the red I wanted, but I never got anything and it&#x27;s been a few weeks. I&#x27;m back to chemicals and I&#x27;m happy with my color again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do recommend this company and henna!!! They are wonderful and the dye is great. I was just unhappy with the color. Each person will have their own results.</li>
    <li> will not buy again,,was a huge mess to use and cleanup was a horror,,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African American so my hair type is different , but I didn&#x27;t think it would hinder the dying process, actually im not sure if it did . There&#x27;s a little burgundy visible but not enough. Better luck for the next person, ill try another brand</li>
