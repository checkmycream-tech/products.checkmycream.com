<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It was great for my hair.  I love the smell.</li>
    <li> I have been using this along with biotin and have seen alot of growth!</li>
    <li> This hair grease is so smooth, light and smells great. I been using it in my 22 month old &#x27;s hair. The back of her head became very rough b/c of how she sleeps but once i wash her hair and moisturize it it is so soft and brings out her natural curls. I will post back to let you know about any length growth.</li>
    <li> In less than two weeks I saw my fuzzy hairs coming in strong where it broke off (edges) after I had my baby 4 months prior to it breaking. The smell is manageable (smells lightly medicated) and it&#x27;s a super light cream-based oil. It&#x27;s oily and creamy but more on the oily side. So I use it very mildly since my hair is naturally oily for the most part.</li>
    <li> My hair is growing back</li>
    <li> Love this product, within two weeks my hair had began to fill in all spots that had suddenly begin to thin, it definitely does work, follow the directions on the jar, and you will see results, very good nourishment for your scalp.</li>
    <li> I bought it at a local beauty supply store. I&#x27;m African American with very fragile hair. I had been experiencing thinning around the edges and breakage all over. Also there were some sort of sores forming in my scalp with pus. I wandered if this had anything to do with my hair breakage?????? I have tried everything, but nothing helped my scalp and hair until I tried this stuff. I don&#x27;t perm or use any type of altering chemicals.......... other than shampoos, conditioners and hair moisturizers. Within about a week I noticed a difference. I also tried this recipe of a couple of other products mixed in with the &amp;#34;Baby Don&#x27;t Be Bald&amp;#34;. I got the idea from a Youtube video I ran across. I mixed a tube of generic brand Monistat 7 and a small container of Sulfur 8 hair grease. Almost immediate, by the next morning the scalp sores had disappeared, within about a week I noticed the hair around my edges had gotten thicker........ and also my hair is now thicker all over, the ends looks stronger. My hair is now in a better condition and ready to experience a better growth pattern........ for two year or more....... my hair would not grow...... no matter what I did. I hope this information will help someone else experiencing similar issues. Oh yeah, according to the users on Youtube of Monistat 7 , it&#x27;s the ingredient miconazole nitrate that assist with hair growth. That combined with the &amp;#34;Baby Don&#x27;t Be Bald&amp;#34; gives the hair and scalp a double opportunity for healing and growth. I added the Sulfur 8 because I like the cool feeling it gives the scalp. I have experienced no side effects thus forth. The Monistat 7 is being used by women, men, black women as well as white women for hair growth. Apparently has been used for quiet sometime, I wish I knew about it sooner.............</li>
    <li> I cannot get enough of this product for it really works and I am so happy that I can purchase it through Amazon.com for I am physically challengued and I do the majprity of my shopping on line.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any improvement from the product just yet+ there is also a sign of Irritation&lt;br /&gt;on the forehead, probably because of sensative skin.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who suffers from common baldness or have alopecia.  When I apply it to my scalp, I can feel it working, like a tingling feeling.  About two weeks time, I&#x27;ve noticed hair bumps in my bald areas and by a month new growth.  Realistically, results may vary with anyone who uses it, but it&#x27;s worth getting!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product!! My little 4 month old brother loss a lot of his hair because of cradle cap. I bought this for him and exactly two weeks later my mother &amp; I seen little hairs starting to sprout from his head where he was completely bald before. I know the lable says ages 2yrs to 100yrs but since it doesn&#x27;t have any harsh products in it my mother decided to use it anyway. It also smells nice for little babies.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent cream to use on very young children&#x27;s hair. I love it.</li>
    <li> My daughter is 5 with not a lot of hair. I used this for a overnight treatment and it&#x27;s showing!</li>
    <li> Love it works wonders will order more, this product makes my hair growth fast</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel so soft! Would recommend to everyone should defiently give it a try and see how it works.</li>
    <li> I used this in my teenage years but  never seen any new hair growth...</li>
    <li> I think it starting to work on my son hair. You just gotta have patients. And it smell good. Ill buy again</li>
    <li> Within two weeks of using it am seeing some hair growth.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a good friend who mentioned having difficulty finding it in retail stores.  At first I thought she was joking at the mention of its name &amp;#34;Baby Don&#x27;t . . . &amp;#34;  I immediately started laughing, but she became very serious and showed me a bald spot in her scalp.  I then went to work on my trusty Amazon and found it.  I was lucky enough to find just the right formula she had been searching for, and now she doesn&#x27;t have a bald spot.  Her hair is growing back.  So &amp;#34;Baby Don&#x27;t Be Bald.&amp;#34;  This formula works best for black hair.  Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work well in my scalp, because it caused my hair to become sticky.  I&#x27;m buying her another jar today.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen results yet, not sure how long one should use before seeing results.....</li>
    <li> Good product, fast delivery! Thanks</li>
    <li> I can tell the difference in my daughters hair already! She had the bald spot where she had been laying on the back of her head n it&#x27;s sprouting now :-)</li>
    <li> I love this product for my baby. It seems to give her hair what it needs to grow. I love the smell of it as well.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. It keep my baby hair moisturized. Im looking forward to seeing more results in a months time</li>
    <li> My mother used to buy this for my sister and me when we were kids. One day, I put a perm in my sister&#x27;s head. I left the perm in too long. When we took the perm out, her edges were gone. Immediately, because of the name, I told her to put some BABY DON&#x27;T BE BALD on it. She did and by the next week, I saw results. I&#x27;m guessing our stuff had the original formula. What I do know is that this product has been around for over 29 years. It aided in the growth of my hair as a child, as well as my family&#x27;s hair. It really does work; therefore, I will give it 5 stars &amp; thank the makers of it. The price is also unbeatable. I haven&#x27;t purchased it off Amazon yet; but because I know it works &amp; my mom&#x27;s beatiful long hair has been damaged, I know exactly where to find it.</li>
