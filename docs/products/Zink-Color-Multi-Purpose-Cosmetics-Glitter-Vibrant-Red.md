      <li>Love mixing this with lipstick for parties.</li>
      <li>put on over lip gloss and add a bit of gloss on top...</li>
      <li>but when I got this in and opened it up it seemed to have more of a pinkish hue and didn&#x27;t fit with the colors of the rest of my make-up</li>
      <li>I love the rich shade of this glitter.</li>
      <li>Definitely easy on the skin and didn&#x27;t bother the eyes at all.</li>
      <li>Looks great over red lipstick for a bold look.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what was described.  </li>
      <li>The little jar is so cute too!</li>
      <li>I would certainly buy from ZINK COLOR again.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m going to wear it on top of the Urban Decay primer, and the Manic Panic Vampire red eyeshadow..</li>
      <li>I used this red glitter for my Halloween eye make-up (I was a devil) and it worked very well and is MUCH cheaper than the Mac cosmetic glitter.</li>
      <li>wow!</li>
      <li>cause they so pretty I had to reorder more I am addicted to the stuff</li>
      <li>It does show up a little better when placed over red eyeshadow.</li>
      <li>A light and fluffy glitter that almost has a velvety finish on lips with a rolling sparkle.</li>
      <li>A useful tip is to put red lipstick on, then the glue, then the glitter, and then lightly brush off excess glitter and do some touch ups with the lipstick on a thin makeup brush.</li>
      <li>A little goes a very long way and when applied with a small brush doesn&#x27;t fly all over the place.</li>
      <li>Applying the glitter over a similar matte color adds drama to brow bone, inner corner of the lower lid or the far inner/outer corners of the eye.</li>

    <li> I received the product 4 days after I ordered it.  It&#x27;s exactly what was described.  It&#x27;s awesome! I would certainly buy from ZINK COLOR again.</li>
    <li> This glitter is gorgeous! The quality is excellent! Looks great over red lipstick for a bold look. I definitely recommend!</li>

But combining colors of these glitters looks good and I bet I could have a lot of fun at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably change the rating to 5 stars after I see how it performs after a night out.</li>
    <li> I love the color of this glitter..I ordered it for an upcoming dub-step concert, and my eyes are really going to pop..The little jar is so cute too! The price is really good for the quantity..I&#x27;m going to wear it on top of the Urban Decay primer, and the Manic Panic Vampire red eyeshadow..I&#x27;m going to work it!!..lol..:)</li>
    <li> I used this red glitter for my Halloween eye make-up (I was a devil) and it worked very well and is MUCH cheaper than the Mac cosmetic glitter. It does show up a little better when placed over red eyeshadow. I wore it for 7 hours and it never started to flake off onto my eyelashes. Love it!</li>
    <li> I found this glitter to be very easy to apply. I also have the Zink Color Multi Purpose Glitter Brilliance Pro 3D - GOLD and BLACK. I&#x27;ve used them with glitter/ornament adhesive for Halloween and glitter gel for special occasions or parties.  The adhesive is best when you are going to be moving a lot, like at a club. The color is vibrant and the fine texture makes it easy to apply without wasting too much (I always stand over the sink with a strip of wax paper lining it so that I can return the &#x27;droppings&#x27; to the container). Applying the glitter over a similar matte color adds drama to brow bone, inner corner of the lower lid or the far inner/outer corners of the eye. TIP: A really bold party-look is to apply the black glitter over some black gel eyeliner that is done in the &#x27;cat eye&#x27; style on the upper lid.[[ASIN:B002OTCU8K Zink Color Multi Purpose Glitter Brilliance Pro Black]] [[ASIN:B002ONEN2W Zink Color Multi Purpose Glitter Brilliance Pro Light Gold New]]</li>
    <li> This is a product required by my daughter&#x27;s dance teacher as part of the proper make up for competition. It is recommended if you dance for competitions.</li>
    <li> Love mixing this with lipstick for parties. Also makes a beautiful eyeliner. This is great if u like bold looks like me. Only need a tiny bit so this jar should last a long time.</li>
    <li> I put the glue on my lips and applied the glitter as lipstick. A useful tip is to put red lipstick on, then the glue, then the glitter, and then lightly brush off excess glitter and do some touch ups with the lipstick on a thin makeup brush.</li>
    <li> I needed this to cosplay as Harley Quinn. The photo looks really nice and ruby red but when I got this in and opened it up it seemed to have more of a pinkish hue and didn&#x27;t fit with the colors of the rest of my make-up so I didn&#x27;t get to use it.</li>
    <li> I love using this glitter on my lips under the low lights it sparkles like crazy and it&#x27;s beautiful. I come back to these glitters everytime I go out at night. A lady even bought all my zink colored glitter off me a night cause they so pretty I had to reorder more I am addicted to the stuff</li>
    <li> gets everywhere I wanted to use it as eyeshadow but it got all over my face and was impossible to get off.</li>
    <li> Awful product. All it is, is lose glitter.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for Halloween. It arrived quickly and was happy with the packaging. The color was vibrant and exactly what I wanted. The only negative thing I could say is that there was quite a bit of fall out and if you&#x27;re not use to using cosmetic glitter you might have some trouble applying it and you will have it all over your face.</li>
    <li> Love this glitter! It can be subtle over red lipstick and then add nice sparkle on top of cream eyeshadow. A little goes a very long way and when applied with a small brush doesn&#x27;t fly all over the place. This wee jar will last about two years for me. Definitely easy on the skin and didn&#x27;t bother the eyes at all.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a lip gloss. I didn&#x27;t know you had to use your own lip stick. I don&#x27;t have many lip sticks that you apply as lip gloss!  Lesson learned!!!</li>
    <li> I love the rich shade of this glitter. A light and fluffy glitter that almost has a velvety finish on lips with a rolling sparkle. I got the Bella Pierre ruby glitter as well and this is a deeper red. It&#x27;s also long lasting and does not crumble up.</li>
    <li> I saw this on a model.  Tried it and loved the look.  put on over lip gloss and add a bit of gloss on top...wow!</li>
    <li> I have absolutely no complaints. The color is beautiful and vibrant. I apply it on with lash glue and instant boost to any look!</li>
