      <li>Started to fall apart after 6-8 hours of constant sweating, but under normal conditions it was great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a big deal, and only something you can notice if you lean over to sniff, and it&#x27;s more a warm body smell than a STANK.</li>
      <li>This is the first DEODORANT that works for my husband and son.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>This seemed to work well when I first tried it, but now my underarms seem to stink a bit no matter</li>
      <li>feel that Pit Stop is reasonably priced for  4 ounces, and it works better than powder/natural deodorants I&#x27;ve purchased in local Co-ops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Anything that touches my body has to be pure.</li>
      <li>I recommend it highly!  </li>

      <li>Am a guy who has been using \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorants for many years and have long since come to the conclusion that nothing on the market works as well as the toxic products so my expectations for alternative deodorants don&#x27;t include total odor elimination.  </li>

      <li>It works admirably well, as far as I can tell.</li>
      <li>I purchased this deodorant as an alternative to Lush powder deodorants.</li>
      <li>Since we bathe a lot I am not sure we cannot get by with a little quality cologne but for the real hairy grunters, this stuff is great - keeps you dry and neutral smelling all through the day.  </li>

      <li>Was really looking forward to this from reading other reviews.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Since we bathe a lot I am not sure we cannot get by with a little quality cologne but for the real hairy grunters, this stuff is great - keeps you dry and neutral smelling all through the day.  Do not expect miracles however after a night of beer and garlic pasta!&lt;br /&gt;The scent has a touch of Patchouli which adds a little mystery to the grunting.</li>
    <li> This is the first DEODORANT that works for my husband and son.  After 43 years of living with my husband&#x27;s stinky pits---this deodorant works.  No stink at all.  Bravo to its inventors!!!    I recommend it highly!  Amazon.com delivered it promptly and in excellent condition too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this deodorant as an alternative to Lush powder deodorants. Overall, this deodorant helps keep me smelling fresh for at least 9 hours with a single application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that Pit Stop is reasonably priced for  4 ounces, and it works better than powder/natural deodorants I&#x27;ve purchased in local Co-ops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like any deodorant powder, you&#x27;re never quite sure how much to apply. I typically use a couple dime-sized powder mounds under each pit. It works for me.</li>
    <li> I wanted to stay away from aluminum in antiperspirant so I tried a few replacements such as crystals, etc. They all gave me a rash. This seemed to work well when I first tried it, but now my underarms seem to stink a bit no matter how much I wash them.</li>
    <li> This stuff may work, but I have no idea because it&#x27;s impossible to get in my armpit. Shake some into your hand and try to get it into your pit before it falls on the floor. Perhaps if I somehow hung upside down and let it fall into place it might be effective, but I&#x27;m doubtful because what little I am able to get into the pit area is blocked by my man-hair. I could shave my pits but that seems kinda drastic, especially since I still would have a hard time getting it in there to begin with (see above).</li>
    <li> So - so - The shower to shower sport powder works much better for far less cost.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Anything that touches my body has to be pure. I don&#x27;t want to trans-dermally absorb any necessary chemicals or additives. Pit Stop hits the mark and works as advertised. Unconventional and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! This stuff really works &amp; yes I will tell my friends about this product! I ordered two, too have an extra one on hand.</li>
    <li> Am a guy who has been using \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorants for many years and have long since come to the conclusion that nothing on the market works as well as the toxic products so my expectations for alternative deodorants don&#x27;t include total odor elimination.  This product met my expectations; in other words, sometimes I stunk and sometimes I didn&#x27;t and this deodorant had little to do with it.</li>
    <li> If you are concerned with chemicals this is a good one to try. Does not stop you from sweating but keeps the odor at bay. You do have to reapply if you are a heavy perspirer. Will re-order for sure!</li>
    <li> After years of stick deodorant this takes a little getting used to.  It isn&#x27;t the old spice musk I grew up on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I love having a little more control over what I cover my pores/skin with everyday (and not stinking by 11am).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Let me preface this slightly by telling you a little bit about myself. I&#x27;m a large, overweight, hairy guy who loves the cold and melts anytime the temperature gets much above 70. In the summer, I spend 5 solid minutes every morning as soon as I get to work with my shirt held open over the air conditioning vent. I sweat. A lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many years ago I developed an odd, painful swelling rash in my armpits. I discovered that I had become sensitized to my solid stick anti-persperant. I switched to spray-style anti-persperant. Rinse, repeat within a year. I switched to solid deodorant sticks. Same problem. Spray deodorant was the same. I tried something from the local LUSH made mostly from activated carbon, but as I suspected, it failed miserably. I couldn&#x27;t go on wearing deodorants without a lot of pain and irritation, but the alternative was smelling like a musk moose at work. Desperate, with winter ending and the weather warming, I found Pit Stop. I decided to do a gamble and try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little bit worried when I read the caution on the label which warned to expect &amp;#34;detoxification&amp;#34; over the first few weeks of wear. Sounded like a bunch of stuff and nonsense. I generously applied it. Within days, I was astonished to see the thickened, hardened, irritated skin in my armpits begin to flake away. After a few weeks of use, my armpits are almost back to the way they were years ago. I am absolutely delighted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, how about the performance? Why the 4 stars? Well, I would give it 4.5 stars if I could. It works admirably well, as far as I can tell. My pits don&#x27;t stink throughout the day, but they do develop a slight smell by the end of the work day. It&#x27;s not a big deal, and only something you can notice if you lean over to sniff, and it&#x27;s more a warm body smell than a STANK. That said, it&#x27;s almost June and I don&#x27;t know how it will hold up under the assault of 90+ degree weather. If I find myself disappointed, I&#x27;ll come back and change the review later. But if that is the case, I&#x27;ll likely end up buying some to bring to work and re-apply at lunchtime or something. I&#x27;ve gone Pit Stop and I don&#x27;t see myself going back.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about this, but went ahead and bought it based on the reviews.  It was very effective for the most part.  Started to fall apart after 6-8 hours of constant sweating, but under normal conditions it was great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d love this if I was living a relaxed, carefree life. Two issues: in a normal day it doesn&#x27;t have the staying power to provide deodorant protection all day (say 6am - 6pm it is failing). In stressful sweat situations it fails very fast. The shortest time period for protection I&#x27;ve experience is three hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, great if you can frequently re-apply and have a relaxed lifestyle. Can&#x27;t stand up to the rigors of a demanding life.</li>
    <li> I like the scent &amp; that it&#x27;s natural.  Hot where we live &amp; it works well. Both my husband &amp; I use it- I use the one for women, but the light scent in either one works for both sexes. We&#x27;re both pleased with it&amp; we&#x27;ve used it for a couple years.  Only drawback is thats it&#x27;s a powder &amp; not a roll on so can be messy if you&#x27;re not careful. I&#x27;ve suggested it to friends &amp; they like it also.  Another plus is that it&#x27;s made in the USA!!!!</li>
    <li> Was really looking forward to this from reading other reviews. It didn&#x27;t work that well for me. I&#x27;m using Tom&#x27;s of Maine deodorant with much better success.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this in combination with Burt&#x27;s Bees herbal deodorant. They&#x27;re the only natural products that work for him.</li>
    <li> Loved it and it worked!  Made my daughter smell me after working in the yard all day.  She even agreed.  But,  it only lasted about 3 1/2 weeks which makes it  if you compare it to others.</li>
