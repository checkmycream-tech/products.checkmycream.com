<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I chose this rating because the fragrance smells like it has been on the shelf for a long time.  A great fragrance does not get better by time.  It is not like wine.  I expected the Parfum version to be more intense than the Eau de Toilette which has a fresh spring fragrance.  This eau de parfum of L&#x27;air du Temps is not fresh.  I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;air du Temps in one version or the other for 33 years.</li>
    <li> This product is one of the remaining bottles with the original fragrance of L&#x27;air du Temps eau de parfum. It is my favorite perfume. I am excited to be able to buy it!</li>
    <li> I have used Nina Ricci since 1966. You can use it day or might without offending anyone who may be scent sensitive. Of all the scents I have tried at various times, this is the only one that I reach for almost daily. Its seems to be highly favored by the males in my life because they aren&#x27;t overwhelmed by it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years. I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t ever stop producing it. I would like to see the bath powder in a round container again.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume especially after I visited the Nina Ricci counter in Paris at the Galleria.  Pricey stuff in the EU!</li>
    <li> This review is for the toilet water not the Eau De Parfum.  I too am disappointed with the lack of original fragrance.  I have used this for over 30 years, and the last bottles I received just lacked that special smell.  People used to comment about how delightful I smelled.  It stayed on my sweaters &amp; I too enjoyed the fragrance.  No longer!  Please bring back the original, Nina Ricci. I intend to try the Parfum.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, packaged great.  Love this scent!</li>
    <li> With so many fakes you never know if an online order will be authentic.  This is authentic L&#x27;Air Du Temps at a wonderful price!  My mother loves it.  I order it for her every Mother&#x27;s Day since her mother also wore it.  It is an unforgettably beautiful scent.</li>
    <li> This perfume has been loved for decades.  And for good reason.  It is a very feminine scent.  And a signature scent for many women.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite perfume.  She was very happy with it, loves the fragrance and the fact I didn&#x27;t have to pay a fortune for it.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> This is my sisters favorite perfume. This was the best price I could find, and got it for her for her birthday! She was thrilled. She said she never had that big a bottle, because it is too expensive! I found the price, for the size, very good. Thanks for making a birthday girl very happy!</li>
    <li> The fragrance is not as lasting as it use to be, so I would have to try another bottle before I can say I was totally dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother in law after I heard her mention  how much she loved the scent. The price was a lot lower than other places.</li>
    <li> We have been buyers of L&#x27;Air Du Temps since 1960....This is a very poor &amp;#34;wanna be&amp;#34;,..Cheap ...plasticity  all around...We were unable to make purchases for a number of years.... Now Back on track one my out top priorities was My Girl of sixty two years.Rose Marie..&lt;br /&gt;I first tried through Amazon to purchase &amp;#34;Parfume&amp;#34; not this water downed......bleep...... I was looking for a Dram of the real thing. I guess I just missed somehow.............To be fair the delivery was ok the packing of the product for mailing was ok. the box that contained the product was fair..barley..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking for the little bottle with that delicate but long lasting very very thin oil. the. Real &#x27;Du Temps</li>
    <li> The fragrance is light and I like it. however it does not last for more than an hr after I wear it. I am not sure if it was original</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this perfume since I was young.  I love this smell as it always reminds me of my Mom who still wears it today also.  Everyone loves this smell as I will always do as long as I live...Never go wrong with L&#x27;Air Du Temps</li>
    <li> very weak aroma, does not last at all.  very disappointed. This is a Fake!  :(</li>
    <li> I have worn this fragrance for 40 years and STILL get compliments on my fragrance!</li>
    <li> This is the closest to the perfume that I have ever purchased.</li>
    <li> I love L&#x27;Air Du Temps by Nina Ricci.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using for 40 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure my mother in law is going to love it because it&#x27;s her favorite fragrance</li>
    <li> This scent was hard to find in Japan had to order it on line.&lt;br /&gt;It has a soft sweet smell of flowers but no rose or lavender.&lt;br /&gt;This is an evening scent for a night out..</li>
    <li> I think, it did not have a scent like I remembered.  I should have ordered the little bottle of Bliss.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. I always get complimented and asked what I&#x27;m wearing. I&#x27;ve read the dismal reviews on the perfume blogs. I understand that it&#x27;s been reformulated since it first came out in the late 1940s. However, I absolutely love the smell even though I rarely smell it on myself (that&#x27;s one of the complaints on the reviews). One of the points of wearing perfume is that other people...MEN...like how you smell! I&#x27;m wearing it because I LOVE the scent but I have received many, and only, favorable comments from male strangers (while I&#x27;ve been out shopping) and also from co-workers. It&#x27;s a lovely sweet scent.</li>
    <li> I have been using this fragrance since I was a teenager and I was thrilled to find it available on Amazon.  Smells just as I remember.</li>
    <li> Not good.  Did not smell right.</li>
    <li> The best ... many men and women stop and ask my honey what perfume she wears cause it smells so good in a very mild way. This product has been around for a long time and yet continues to top the perfume/eau de toilette chart.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite, receive compliments every time I wear it.</li>
    <li> I first encountered L&#x27;air du Temps (air of the times) many years ago when I was working in the City of Austin Planning Department.  Surprisingly for that era there were three women in our unit.  This is where I learned to cuss, unfortunately.  The second in command was a jaded divorcee.  One day I happened to notice her perfume.  It suited me immediately, floral but subtly so.  I have used it ever since.</li>
    <li> I think it must be old stock - did not smell right!</li>
    <li> Have worn it for years</li>
    <li> My mother has been using this product for 40 years and she knew it was an absolute FAKE the first day</li>
    <li> A BIRTHDAY GIFT THAT WAS A SURPRISE AND LOVED</li>
    <li> It is getting harder and harder to find L&#x27;Air Du Temps. Most view this as an old ladys fragrance.Shame as it has more class than modern fragrances.</li>
    <li> genuine perfume, great smell, great price. 5 star</li>
    <li> Nice smell, bought because my Mom had some, and reminds me of her.  But smell doesn&#x27;t seem to last long</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Air Du Temps has been around for a long time.  It is a delicate floral fragrance, mixed with jasmine, rose, bergamot and a few others.  I find it to be just right for any occasion, and it wears well throughout the day, or night.  It actually seems to get even better the longer it&#x27;s on.  I bought my last bottle from a perfume company, but Amazon had it for a few bucks less this time around...a nice plus.  Of note, I&#x27;ve tried the cologne too, but I prefer the perfume as the scent is more defined and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> My wife liked it very much.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and saved alot of $$$$$$ plus it was delivered fast.</li>
    <li> A little stronger than I remembered from 30 years ago.  Also the plastic bird was chipped on the wings and various other places.</li>
    <li> was a gift. I personally do not like it but the giftee adores it. so is an individual type of perfume.</li>
    <li> i love this parfum.  i love this better than the toilet spray.  this is a little stronger, so you only have to put a little bit on.  this parfum drys so nicely.  sometimes, i just smell myself and smile.  i am very much please with this purchase.  it it worth every bit of the money i paid.  i would definitely buy this parfum again, and again.  l&#x27;air du temps has been my favorite fragrance for over twenty years.  it does not matter what fragrance i wear, i always come back to l&#x27;air du temps.  i love it and i love the parfum spray evey more.</li>
    <li> I have been using this scent since 1980.  I am very sensitive to scents and this is the only one I have found that I can actually wear that I like the scent.  I would highly recommend this to anyone that has sensitivity to scents and to others as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several years.  Intoxicating!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mom for mother&#x27;s day since its nearly impossible to find in stores any longer. It smelled just like I remembered and she loved it.</li>
    <li> Smelled like cologne. Not sure if thats what was intended, but that&#x27;s the case here. 5 stars, i suppose. heh</li>
    <li> This is an old, tried and true fragrance.  Not too strong, not too flowery- a little goes a long way!  Same thing I used to wear when we first got married 35 years ago :-)</li>
    <li> Just got this in the swirled glass jar and clear Lucite doves topper. The first spray confirmed that my EDT had gone bad because this is what I remember. Heavy carnation and musk for me with a supporting cast of spices and wood. That one spray was two hours ago and the sillage is still very strong. I expect I will be smelling this on myself in the morning. Exquisite spring day fragrance.</li>
    <li> This was a fake perfume, could not return. Did not smell like L&#x27;Air Du Temps, evaporated on my skin.</li>
    <li> This is not the real deal!  I&#x27;ve had the real perfume with crystal bird on bottle and this isn&#x27;t even close.  Even the bottle looks fake. The initial scent is similar but it fades in minutes.  Too bad!  It&#x27;s my favorite scent.</li>
    <li> Sweet smell. Haven&#x27;t seen this perfume in years. Love the smell and it lasts.</li>
    <li> The perfume arrived promptly and was as described.</li>
    <li> I wore this a long time ago, and recently found it again on Amazon. Smelled just like I remembered it. I still love it! To me it has a clean, slightly soapy smell. I really like the way it settles in on me after a hour or so. Really nice.</li>
    <li> I wore L&#x27;Air Du Temps by Nina Ricci back in the 1970&#x27;s. I had actually forgotten about it until seeing it on Amazon. I ordered the Eau De Parfum Spray (1.7oz) &amp; have been thrilled with it. It is a soft, feminine fragrance that hasn&#x27;t been duplicated by all the new,celebrity fragrances so popular these days. Call me old-fashioned but I prefer to call myself classic, and I prefer to call L&#x27;Air Du Temps a classic, too.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this fragrance as well as most of my friends, it isn&#x27;t overwhelming or very heavy.</li>
    <li> I have worn this fragrance for many years, and constantly get compliments.  I&#x27;ve tried other fragrances and they just didn&#x27;t measure up because they&#x27;re usually too strong and overpowering.  If you prefer a light, crisp, beautiful scent that will have people say &amp;#34;you smell so good,&amp;#34; this is it.</li>
    <li> Great deal and have worn this for a very long time.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this Fragrance It is the best&lt;br /&gt;nice and light</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn it all my life!</li>
    <li> I wanted the perfume for my girlfriend not my grandma. It smelled like old lady perfume. My valentine went bad cause it wasn&#x27;t the smell I expected</li>
    <li> My favorite for over 40 years. The parfum is slightly stronger and lasts longer than the cologne spray. Sometimes I use both for a lasting scent..&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful floral that is a classic...</li>
    <li> My mom loves the parfum, I gave for the birthday and she was amazed, she always only find the Eua De Toliet.&lt;br /&gt;The Parfum Last All day long</li>
    <li> I love the fragrant !</li>
    <li> I have used this fragrance for over 40 years both the Eau De and the Parfum.  I received my order from Amazon and I am so disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;This bottle does not smell like the L&#x27;Air Du Temps that I know so well.&lt;br /&gt;Surely they would not change the fragrance and still call it by the same name, would they?&lt;br /&gt;Could it be old?&lt;br /&gt;I am going to have to keep it because I threw the box away before I used the parfum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is strong and pungent instead of the subtle flowery scent that I know so well.&lt;br /&gt;Really very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I used the eau de toilette in the 1970s, and although I enjoyed it, it never lasted very long on me.  I have not used it in decades, but Amazon has such a good price on the eau de parfum, I decided to try it again, and I am glad I did.  The top notes and middle notes are amazingly feminine and alluring.  By the time the bottom notes have settled in, I have been wearing it for several hours.  The parfum is much longer lasting.  I like it so much more.  I also love the tribute to the classic bottle, too. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing L&#x27;Air du Temps for more than 30 years now!  Absolutely love it!  Fresh, feminine and sensual, but not overpowering.  Have always received lots of compliments over the years.</li>
    <li> I have loved this scent since...forever!!  It is so clean and lasts a long time.  Love!</li>
    <li> This stuff has the most beautiful smell. I have worn it for years and will continue wearing it. This is a great price!!!!!! Amazon is the best place to purchase for this price!!!!</li>
    <li> Hard to find light fragrance perfume</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s perfume of choice. It&#x27;s a great fragrance and was offered at a great price. I&#x27;ll order for her again.</li>
    <li> This perfume has been my wife&#x27;s favorite for many years.  There have been too many times that we have gone to Macy&#x27;s and other stores and it is always hit and miss in finding it.  We have been ordering it on Amazon now for about a year.  As a school teacher, she always wants a good supply of her perfume, and on the day that she ran out, her perfume arrived right on schedule.  A Happy Wife leads to a good Life! Thanks!</li>
    <li> My wife thinks that this is the best perfume ever, and she really loves it.  Seems like a timeless favorite to me.</li>
    <li> One of my all-time favorite fragrances that I always have.</li>
