      <li>I am a mother of a 7 years boy,  a litle basseball player exposed to the sun,  and I am satisfied with the protection of&lt;br</li>
      <li>The thing no one ever told you before kids that would make your life soooo much better.</li>
      <li>The squeeze tubes are much better.</li>
      <li>It works pretty good preventing UV exposure.  </li>
      <li>So good you really need to &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; it off in the shower.</li>
      <li>Creamy texture is easy to rub in.</li>

      <li>This is not so easy with a squeeze bottle.  </li>
      <li>It is not too strong of a smell for my grandchildren, so I have given it to them.</li>
      <li>It also does not leave a lot of residue in our pool, which is a huge plus.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a huge tub of sunscreen at an affordable price.</li>
      <li>Fantastic outdoor sunscreen</li>
      <li>Since finishing this bottle, I have tried Coppertone Kids tear free sunblock.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a real treat to use a sunscreen that&#x27;s obviously effective but doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes.  </li>
      <li>This product contains no titanium dioxide, an important compound to prevent melinoma (which I have).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Tear free.  </li>
      <li>light white-cast.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a huge quantity, works really well, and while I can&#x27;t really put it on my face it works great on my child</li>
      <li>I would recommend this sunscreen to anyone who has sensitive and fair skin.</li>
      <li>The presence of a physical block (emulsified zinc) makes this a very effective sunblock.  </li>
      <li>really like this product as it is pretty good at being both sweat and water resistant</li>
      <li>I can also usually find great prices on Amazon!  </li>
      <li>Still worth covering up!</li>
      <li>and I can actually use it without any reactions on my arms and legs, which is great because I spend a lot more on the natural stuff for my face and didn&#x27;t want to use that on the rest of my body.  </li>
      <li>I use something more gentle for the face.  </li>
      <li>swift and well packed, many thanks</li>
      <li>Tried this along with Alba Sport and Alba Kids, this was superior hands down, not to mention a better value.  </li>
      <li>Luckily It came in a plastic bag, because some sunscreen came out of the container.</li>
      <li>Love this for my for my grand kids, they can play outside all day with no sun burn, I use some too.</li>
      <li>We love to swim and live in California.  </li>
      <li>It is essentially scent-free, which is nice as well.  </li>
      <li>It is nice and sticky so that if you do spend a couple of hours in the water, it is enough protection.  </li>
      <li>it is suitable to Asian skin texture, and color is so good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s garbage and that&#x27;s exactly where I put it - in the trash.</li>
      <li>I decided to try this last summer and both the kids and us parents love it.  </li>
      <li>The manufacturer rep explained that code 11102TC should be interpreted as follows: 11 (first to digits) stands for the year of manufacturing -</li>
      <li>I have used this on my face several dozen times for tennis matches with no adverse impact on my complexion at all, plus I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes when I sweat.  </li>
      <li>Fast delivery, and with optimal performance!</li>
      <li>Love the product and that in addition to chemical sunscreens that it also has zinc oxide in it to provide longer lasting sun protection.</li>
      <li>The protection factor is only okay.  </li>
      <li>We bought two bottles, probably will order several more when they run out.</li>
      <li>I bought this because we have had good success with Banana Boat sensitive/baby sunscreen in the past.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very nice and good quality. I recommend</li>
    <li> My family loves this sunscreen.  We used to be one of the many people who lived by the aerosol sunscreens for the convenience they offer.  I decided to try this last summer and both the kids and us parents love it.  During the summers in So CA we spend a lot of time at the pool and beach.  As a family we always have a ritual of applying sunscreen before we go so that once we are there we don&#x27;t have to worry about it.  With the aerosols, you really cannot apply inside of your house because of the overspray residue.  Also, they drive the kids nuts from the alcohol burning any cuts or irritation they may have on their skin.  This product with its pump makes it very easy to dispense and apply a coat without making a mess or irritating their skin.  Additionally, I cannot count how many clothing items were destroyed from the yellowing caused by the aerosols.  This stuff goes on pretty thick, which we are OK with for the protection, and it lasts a long time.  Where we felt we needed to apply the sprays every hour or so, this seems to last much longer.  I would not recommend using on adult faces since it is so heavy, but the kids don&#x27;t seem to mind.  If you want a thinner product, I would recommend the Banana Boat Sport in the orange pump bottle.  We still use the spray for the occasional follow up at the pool or beach for convenience, but if we start with a base of this, we feel more comfortable with the coverage and protection.  Last but not least, this stuff goes a long way.  Cost wise there is no comparison whatsoever.  This $10 bottle is the equivalent of at least 6 or more of the aerosols cans.</li>
    <li> My son has a naturally tan complection and it&#x27;s impossible to get this lotion to rub in so that you can&#x27;t see it.  It works pretty good preventing UV exposure.  He just dreads me putting it on.  My hunt for the perfect kids sunscreen continues.</li>
    <li> I do have sensitive skin but usually don&#x27;t react to sunscreens. The day after I applied this my entire face broke out with white bumps. I also don&#x27;t like the way it goes on: feels very heavy and greasy. I got a smudge on my suit and even pool water didn&#x27;t get the stuff off. It did block the sun, however, which is why I gave it a 1.</li>
    <li> Protects my kids from CA sun with no adverse effects or allergic reactions.&lt;br /&gt;If they play around water, you have to re-apply it from time to time, but it does fair well even on the beaches.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a huge tub of sunscreen at an affordable price. The sunscreen works in easily to the skin and our boys haven&#x27;t had any adverse reactions, even our son with excema. Since it&#x27;s now December and I bought this in the summer, I&#x27;m blanking on anything negative about it. Which means we&#x27;ll buy again next spring/summer.</li>
    <li> We have used this product all summer and love it.  While it&#x27;s difficult to rub in at times, it certainly does the job for sunblock.  And she never flinches when I put it on her face.  Some of the other lotions we&#x27;ve used have burned her eyes.</li>
    <li> We have 4 kids under the age of 7 with very pale sensitive skin. We are outdoors A LOT in the Minnesota summer and go through sunscreen like crazy. This volume is spectacular. The product is spectacular. No tears, easy enough application. We&#x27;ve tried the spray kind and it still needs to be rubbed in and ends up being something they want to spray on themselves, which is a disaster. They are much better at smoothing on lotion.</li>
    <li> Pump is so convenient.  The presence of a physical block (emulsified zinc) makes this a very effective sunblock.  Creamy texture is easy to rub in.</li>
    <li> Best mineral sunscreen in large bottle. Yes there are some ingredients that are not the best on EWG but this is honestly the most cost effective sunscreen without chemical sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and son applied this product liberally to their skin prior to attending a three hour ball game in the bright April sun. When they came home, both had red faces and slightly burned arms. We had been using Neutrogena&#x27;s sheer sunblock but it ran out and this was on sale. Neither were burned when they used the Neutrogena sunblock at the ballpark a few weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The pump is easy to use, and this lotion has a slightly milky consistency, which makes it easier to apply. There is no strong sunscreen odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Doesn&#x27;t seemt to work well, not sure if the formula is perhaps too runny? It contains titanium dioxide which is great for UVB blocking, but it doesn&#x27;t have much UVA coverage. It also contains parabens and vitamin A, which have potentially hazardous health effects (they are known carcinogenic agents). I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing this again, unless Banana Boat improves/modernizes the formula.</li>
    <li> We do not like to use spray sunblocks on our little ones because of the fumes.  This sunblock is amazing.  It goes on very well and we have yet to have a burnt baby.  It also does not leave a lot of residue in our pool, which is a huge plus.</li>
    <li> Great for arms and legs (body).&lt;br /&gt;Very light white-cast.&lt;br /&gt;It has that sunscreeny smell, comes out goopy, goes on creamy.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend a softer formula of sunscreen for your face, like Biore or Shiseido.&lt;br /&gt;But this is good as an all-over protector, if you&#x27;re going on a picnic or spending a lot of time outdoors. :]</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, and with optimal performance!</li>
    <li> Overall:&lt;br /&gt;-Recommend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Titanium Dioxide and Zinc Dioxide only active ingredients&lt;br /&gt;-pump dispenser&lt;br /&gt;-good sweat and water resistance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this sunscreen primarily because Titanium Dioxide and Zinc Dioxide only active ingredients. I am always reading about how the other ingredients in sunscreen are pretty nasty, so it&#x27;s great to be able to find this affordable alternative on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product as it is pretty good at being both sweat and water resistant and it is fairly easy to rub it.</li>
    <li> Wish it was a little easier to spread on the body, but it definitely works - no sunburns on our pale little boys despite many days at the beach in and out of the water for hours.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself because it said it was \\&quot;Fragrance Free\\&quot;.  I have terrible sinuses and fragrances make me sick. With this product \\&quot;Fragrance Free\\&quot; means they didn&#x27;t add perfume.  It has a smell.  It is not too strong of a smell for my grandchildren, so I have given it to them.</li>
    <li> Finally a sunscreen that really stays on and doesn&#x27;t sting the kids eyes or irritate the I skin. This our &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I like it, and particularly for my face. The white appearance on initial application is quickly absorbed.</li>
    <li> There is no expiration date on this product, only a cryptic code. The manufacturer rep explained that code 11102TC should be interpreted as follows: 11 (first to digits) stands for the year of manufacturing - 2011&lt;br /&gt;102 (next 3 digits) stands for the day of the year for manufacturing in 2011.&lt;br /&gt;The expiration date is 3 years after the manufacturing date. Code 11102TC is for a product that expired in April 2014.&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer of Banana Boat products (Energizer Household Products division) should post expiration dates without one having to waste time to call the company, etc. I prefer to buy product from companies that clearly stamp the expiration dates on their product, not hide it behind cryptic codes.</li>
    <li> I like this sunscreen</li>
    <li> Love this for my for my grand kids, they can play outside all day with no sun burn, I use some too.</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen my kids can use due to their sensitive skin. I usually have to buy it in bulk, I love that it comes with a pump dispenser...very convenient! I would recommend this sunscreen to anyone who has sensitive and fair skin.</li>
    <li> Tried this along with Alba Sport and Alba Kids, this was superior hands down, not to mention a better value.  This is a very thick sunscreen, and very &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; -- meaning it sticks to you regardless of sweat, water immersion, etc.  When you wash your hands after applying, you can actually see the water beading on your hands, which tells you how well it&#x27;s staying on.  I have used this on my face several dozen times for tennis matches with no adverse impact on my complexion at all, plus I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes when I sweat.  It is essentially scent-free, which is nice as well.  We bought two bottles, probably will order several more when they run out.</li>
    <li> I use this for myself because it&#x27;s unscented.</li>
    <li> I have always used Banana Boat for my kids.  It works great and doesn&#x27;t leave their skin feeling greasy.  I order products like this from Amazon instead of going to the store for convenience.  I can also usually find great prices on Amazon!  I would definitely order this again!</li>
    <li> lost one star only because it is a pain to transport to places for the day, worked for entire family even though we all tan well there were no burns, friends used too and they liked it</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE, LOVE!  Great for families with toddlers!  The pump style of dispensing the sunblock is genius.  I LOVE it and plan to buy one for every bedroom and bathroom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- The pump is amazingly convenient.  It helps my toddlers regulate how much sunblock to apply without much supervision from me in the mornings.  The pump also allows me to get sunscreen with one hand while I hold my daughter with the other.  This is not so easy with a squeeze bottle.  This pump bottle has given me 5 minutes back in the morning.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I still have to apply the sunblock on my baby and I still have to rub in the rest on my 4 year old.  But now, instead of taking time to ration the sunblock on my four year old and juggling my 2 yr old in my arms while trying to squeeze out sunblock, we just pump and apply!&lt;br /&gt;- Tear free.  I can smear this haphazardly on my kids without worrying about them feeling a sting in their eye for next hour.&lt;br /&gt;- Unscented&lt;br /&gt;- Gentle on sensitive skin.  My son is sensitive to baby Johnsons &amp; Johnsons.  No issues with Banana Boat!&lt;br /&gt;- Sunblock works well.  We love to swim and live in California.  There have been no sunburns and no red skin since we started using this sunblock.  We had issues with Honest company sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS (Kind-of):&lt;br /&gt;- It is a bit thick and white.  No stars have been taken off since it rubs in easily and it is not oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried Honest company (2-3 star), Neutrogena baby stick (5 star for baby faces), Neutrogena baby (4.5 stars), Neutrogena spray (4 star), Banana Boat Baby (4 star), Coppertone sport bottle (4 star) and Coppertone spray (4 star)</li>
    <li> i thought it was going to be a different item, bigger then it is..but its a great product</li>
    <li> I was so happy to finally find a kids sunscreen that didn&#x27;t have any of the usual chemical sunscreens in it (Octylcrylene, Avobenzone, Octinoxate, Octisalate, OxyBenzone, etc)  I have very sensitive skin and those chemicals make me break out in a rash so I didn&#x27;t even want to touch the stuff to put it on my son who doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same sensitivity to it as I do.  I wasn&#x27;t ready to shell out 30 dollars for a few ounces of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; brands so this was an excellent happy medium.  It&#x27;s a huge quantity, works really well, and while I can&#x27;t really put it on my face it works great on my child and I can actually use it without any reactions on my arms and legs, which is great because I spend a lot more on the natural stuff for my face and didn&#x27;t want to use that on the rest of my body.  If you&#x27;re concerned about &amp;#34;nanoparticles&amp;#34; or any of the other natural buzzwords this probably isn&#x27;t for you, but if you or your kid reacts to normal chemical sunscreens, this is a winner.  You&#x27;ll definitely have that sort of unearthly white glow you always get from zinc or titanium based sunscreens but that doesn&#x27;t bother me personally, so I won&#x27;t be taking a star off for it.  Your results may vary.</li>
    <li> We get a couple bottles of this size and brand for the kids and use it all summer long!  It goes on easy and isn&#x27;t greasy, and it gets the job done!  The no tears formula is a plus too so it doesn&#x27;t sting their eyes.  Banana Boat Kids is the brand we trust!  I highly recommend giving it a try!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t protect against chlorine but a very good sun block.</li>
    <li> This sunblock is very thick so it is hard to apply to a child. My sons looked completely white after I put this sunblock on them, even though I rubbed it in very well. Also, it does not have the best score on EWG&#x27;s website. However, this bottle lasted my family a long time. Also, it seemed to protect my sons&#x27; skin. Since finishing this bottle, I have tried Coppertone Kids tear free sunblock. I prefer the Coppertone.</li>
    <li> After I had melanoma, my doctor recommended this and several other kinds of sun protection.  It definitely works.  It stays on all day.</li>
    <li> Works great and gentle on my boys&#x27; skin</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen! I have very Sensitive Skin I always use it and never get burned at the beach. Totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> We go through buckets of sunscreen, and this stuff is great.  It&#x27;s a no-frills sunscreen.  Leaves a thick white film, and it&#x27;s definitely oily.  If you&#x27;re wearing black, it&#x27;ll leave nasty white stains.  However, it also doesn&#x27;t come off, keeps away sunburns, and comes in an easy to apply pump bottle.  It also doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate sensitive skin.  So, it does the job we bought it for.</li>
    <li> Good Sunscreen.  The pump is very convenient, especially when you are putting sunscreen on 10 children under the age of 11 at the beach.  This sunscreen goes a lot further than the spray sunscreen so we had enough for almost 10 days worth of sun protection.</li>
    <li> Easy to put on and stays on. Doesn&#x27;t burn the eyes either.</li>
    <li> parents looking for a great sunblock THIS IS IT!  We are at beach every week, live in Hawaii and number of us have tried ALL KINDS.  This one works the best, even swimming the whole time.  So good you really need to &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; it off in the shower.</li>
    <li> This is the thickest sunscreen I have ever seen in my life. Even after vigorously rubbing it into my girls&#x27; skin, it leave a white cloudy film that will become spotty if they get wet. I have discovered that the trick is to rub it in, wait a few minutes, then rub it in again. Unfortunately, due to the thick consistency, you need a good amount to cover an arm or leg. All this being said, my girls have gone all summer (including outdoor day camp and a week at a waterpark) without getting burnt, so it does its job.</li>
    <li> The sun tan location is really good but this particular container is not. The benefit of the container is that it holds a lot of sunscreen the bad part of the container is the pump. I bought two of these containers, the first one the pump didn&#x27;t work and the second one the pump broke soon after opening. The squeeze tubes are much better. Also, I just bought a squeeze one at Target with the same amount of sunscreen for $8.99.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who does not want to burn yet still tan. My husband and I use this all the time. We use it in The Islands and have NEVER burned!</li>
    <li> it is suitable to Asian skin texture, and color is so good.&lt;br /&gt;I can feel protected from sun after using this sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen for not burning my toddlers eyes. Does leave a white residue and doesn&#x27;t rub in clear like others but to me that is worth it to not have tow orry about the eyes (as long as you are careful and obviously avoid getting on eyelashes, but even then actually I haven&#x27;t had a problem).</li>
    <li> Fantastic outdoor sunscreen, I wear this everyday even if the only sun I see is walking to and from my car to work. Still worth covering up!</li>
    <li> swift and well packed, many thanks</li>
    <li> I am a mother of a 7 years boy,  a litle basseball player exposed to the sun,  and I am satisfied with the protection of&lt;br /&gt;Banana Boat Kids SPF 50 Sunscreen. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because we have had good success with Banana Boat sensitive/baby sunscreen in the past. The just seemed like same product, but new packaging. BUT, I must say that it has irritated my skin so much. I have little hives where I used it, and it has been days since application. It took me a while to figure out that this product was what was irritating my skin because I didn&#x27;t see how different packaging would change the product. Then I figured out it was this product. I am NOT even a sensitive person, nothing has irritated my skin before, no allergies, nothing! I would never put this product on a child or baby. It&#x27;s garbage and that&#x27;s exactly where I put it - in the trash. As a side note, it didn&#x27;t even block the sun either. I didn&#x27;t get a sunburn, but I did get extremely tan using this produt, which was not the point of getting a SPF of 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all fairness, Amazon packaged and ship this product as promised, and in a timely manner, the actual product is what is terrible.</li>
    <li> The product is good - I hate the pump. It leaks. Store it in a plastic bag and expect to lose product due to leakage. I removed it and put in a different dispenser.</li>
    <li> Me guata el precio y la calidad estoy muy satisfecha creo que esta mas barrato aquí que en la tienda y llego muy rápido sin ningún problema</li>
    <li> I have got, whatever I expected.</li>
    <li> I love this brand to use on the body.  I use something more gentle for the face.  It is nice and sticky so that if you do spend a couple of hours in the water, it is enough protection.  We spent a week in Cancun and there was plenty in here for a family of four.</li>
    <li> great sunscreen and the pump is very convenient.  However, it leaves a LOT of sunscreen on the bottom that you can&#x27;t reach with the pump.</li>
    <li> good buy but not easy to open for the 1st time use</li>
    <li> Much cheaper in stores. Great product, though.</li>
    <li> One of my children burns easily, and after being frustrated by other sunblocks that smelled bad and/or had to be reapplied every few hours, I asked my pediatrician for his recommendation. He recommended blocks with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide as an active ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunblock has titanium dioxide as the active ingredient, doesn&#x27;t have an odor (at least not one that I notice) and is thick, maybe that means nothing, but it makes me feel like it will block better than a thin lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I *love* the pump bottle. It makes a big difference in application time compared to a squeeze bottle of the same stuff.</li>
    <li> Worked great.  Not greasy and stayed on after being in the water.</li>
    <li> jsut wha ti needed for my golf.&lt;br /&gt;works well and doesnt cost a bomb.&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended to any golfer or outdoor enthusiast.</li>
    <li> We have always used this product.  I love the pump on this one and the price is amazing.  It lives in our van.  Doesn&#x27;t sting kids eyes.</li>
    <li> Love this product; we use it for adults.</li>
    <li> Love the product and that in addition to chemical sunscreens that it also has zinc oxide in it to provide longer lasting sun protection.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a real treat to use a sunscreen that&#x27;s obviously effective but doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes.  This is a great product.  The squirt bottle works nicely too.  What more could you wish for?</li>
    <li> I have to unscrew the cap and pour this in my hands, no instructions whatsoever as to operating the &#x27;child safe&#x27; nozzle. This makes a big mess. I tried emailing the company (no phone number on their website)and to contact them you must fill out a long online form, including the UPC code of the product and date code. You will require a magnifing glass to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also note: This product contains no titanium dioxide, an important compound to prevent melinoma (which I have).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Google the massive recall of Banana Boat products in 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More later, now I&#x27;m cleaning up the mess this made trying to get the cap off.</li>
    <li> We have been fans of this for awhile.  Good score on EWG and now with  pump.  Yes - a pump.  The thing no one ever told you before kids that would make your life soooo much better.</li>
    <li> decent price.. need for my kid while go out under the sun</li>
    <li> Like it because it lasts although you have to really rub it in otherwise itʻs white.  Great for children!  Reapplication not needed as much with this product.</li>
    <li> I like that this is a physical sunscreen, but it is so heavy and greasy that it is uncomfortable to use.  My daughter HATES the feeling of it and refuses to use it. The protection factor is only okay.  We&#x27;ve used this in the Hawaiian sun and all come out pink/red.  I&#x27;ll probably use up the rest but I won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> I haven´t tried it yet, but in general I like banana boat products. Luckily It came in a plastic bag, because some sunscreen came out of the container.</li>
