<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> not yet convinced of it&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
    <li> I know this is a homeopathic cream, but it came recommended to me, and I think it has done a remarkable job of easing the pain in my knee.  I had surgery to repair two torn menisci and to clear out some osteoarthritis.  I apply it one or twice a day and  I really do believe that it works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice that it helped at all with pain.</li>
    <li> I have tried every cream and nothing works like this. I had my daughter use t for her hand,she said ya it is like all the rest and does not work, but she tried it any way and came back to me and said wow this works, took away the pain, the she told her girl friend about it and she bought it and in friend  bought 2 bottles. I&#x27;m a great believer in this cream.</li>
    <li> Miracle product. Works wonders. Used it for my sciatic pain.</li>
    <li> I WAS REALLY GLAD TO RECEIVE THIS PRODUCT IN JUST A FEW DAYS.  I WAS VERY SATISFIED WITH THE WHOLE&lt;br /&gt;ORDERING PROCESS.  IT&#x27;S A GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Great product! Sooths my aching hands without overwelming smell. I put it on every evening before bed and my hands are feeling great in the morning. Love it!</li>
    <li> It is the only topical cream that truly seems to bring relief from pain.</li>
    <li> I like it because it works for me. Whenever I have pain due to my arthritis I rub on the Topricin and shortly the pain is gone.  Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
    <li> As stated in the past, it is the best topical pain reliever I have experienced.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working well. Love the feel. Goes on easy. A+++++</li>
    <li> I have a comparatively mild and occasional problem with restless leg syndrome.  I hesitate to recommend Topricin for this because others have it so much worse and what helped me might not help someone else.  Nevertheless, it seems to me that rubbing in enough Topricin to cover the leg from aproximately mid-calf to mid/upper thigh ....... especially on the back side ....... did help me (it doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot).  I hope it helps you too.</li>
    <li> This is very helpful for my problem. It helps to relieve my discomfort at night so I can rest. Thanks</li>
    <li> Have used this creme for a long time, I fined it works very well for carpel tunnTakes about 15 or 20 min after applied to notice the relief.</li>
    <li> This is a great produce for neuropathy pain.  I have also used it for arthritis in my knee and it does help.</li>
    <li> This is well worth the price.  Not only helps with pain but aids in healing.  I have used this on bruises, sore in the crack of my mouth, and blood spots as well.  Heals within days vice weeks.</li>
    <li> Glad to have found this product.  Use this pre-jog and for aches and pains.  It is working well.  The low price made it even better.</li>
    <li> This worked for me. Especially on the lower back. While I don&#x27;t expect any magic the back does feel better.</li>
    <li> This product is consistantly the best I have found to soothe and comfort aches &amp; pains.</li>
    <li> This product may help for some sprains and strains but for a nerve damage type injury not much help.  But I could see it working for just an ordinary back issue or knee type pain.</li>
    <li> Product arrived ahead of scheduled delivery date and with minimal packaging.  Product in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful, natural product that gives almost immediate relief.  We use it all the time for sore muscles and other aches and pains.  I recommend it to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> Snake bite...I first was introduced to this homeopathic remedy, although in a different form, from a curandero in Central America...it works.  I&#x27;m a believer.  Topricin works for arthritic aches and pains.</li>
    <li> This product works. That&#x27;s more than I can say for many others. It relieves pain and inflamation in the target area effectively. There are no side effects. There is no smell like some of these products that you can buy in a drugstore. There is no burning or pepper in it. It is a safe product. But remember, depending on the severity of your problem, it could take a few weeks to fully kick in. Remember, it is not a pharmaceutical drug that usually works instantly. But with me, it did work instantly. My sister used it for an injured knee and it speed up her healing greatly. My friend used it on a tennis elbow and the severity of his problem is greatly reduced.  If you are using it for an arthritic conditions, try combining this with 12,000 gauss neo magnets, or 4,500 gauss ceramic magnets. By itself I found 60% relief. But adding the magnets, the number went up to 90% and absolutely no side effects.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST cream for nerve pain and helps my muscular back pain a lot! NO smell is amazing and its not full of harmful chemicals. love!</li>
    <li> My husband got his hand smashed at work; it was black and blue,had a blood blister and an area that turned hard on the under side of his thumb(a hematoma maybe?).He also had pain in his legs from various accidents/injuries.I ordered the Topricin Cream for his legs,and we were both thrilled it took his pain away.I rub his legs every night now!!And I just decided to rub some in his hand one night and couldn&#x27;t believe one application made his hand feel so much better.We love Topricin!!</li>
    <li> it is ok. expensive for what it does</li>
    <li> I recently had my knee replaced and my physical therapist recommended this product.  It relieves pain and stiffness.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  It does everything it says. It was recommended by a friend who had severe nerve pain and diabetes and she got great relief.  I have everyday aches and pains, nighttime foot pain and itching and this has been such a relief.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders. I have jumpers knee (volleyball) and was involved in a car crash while cycling, so my chiropractor recommended it. Let&#x27;s say hands down did a better holistic job than icy hot/bengay etc.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years now and it seem to help in relieving some of my discomfort of Tendinitist and lower back pain.  I&#x27;d recommend people give it a try it is not a cure all but it just might help some and thats better than nothing.</li>
    <li> Cream was given as a sample from the Chiropractor and it work great on my sons neck after hockey.  I purchased some on line to save cash and received it quick and at a better price than at the Drs. office.  Happy with the product and the great service.</li>
    <li> I have been using this every day for 2 weeks now, and it has really helped my hands. I do repetitive work with my hands every day and the pain in my knuckles was getting so bad I could hardly finish a job. I use this 3 to 4 times a day and am very impressed. I keep one jar at work and one jar at home. I am sold!!</li>
    <li> I call it miracle cream. I injured my rotator cuff a while back (no tear). I got a cortisone shot and physical therapy. But only after I applied Topricin twice a day (morning and nite) my pain gradually went away.  Always have a jar on hand in my refrigerator.</li>
    <li> This is THE reason I can sleep at night with my rotator cuff injury. Tried all kinds of other rubs THIS WORKS</li>
    <li> My husband suffers from severe back pain and he says whenever he uses this product he is pain free for up to 8 hours.   I find that amazing since this is an all natural, safe product.  He has now thrown aware his pain pills.  I just tried it myself today on poison ivy.   The itch and discomfort are gone.    I can&#x27;t wait to try it on other skin and pain problems as they come up.</li>
    <li> One of the few topical remedies that works better than expected.&lt;br /&gt;Pain relief for my rotator cuff tear. Forget hot/cold patches.&lt;br /&gt;This crème has no noxious odor, acts fast and long lasting.</li>
    <li> Purchased for issue with rotator cuff and tendonitis in shoulder.  Did absolutely nothing for this symptom.</li>
    <li> I dont know how this product works, but it does.  I injured my heel in Yoga, and have a good deal of pain.  If I apply this cream 3-4 x&#x27;s a day, it really works!  I am a Massage Therapist and recommend it to my clients.</li>
    <li> Really worked well for my neck and shoulder pain.</li>
    <li> This cream really helps with my heel pain from Plantar Fasciitis, my heel feels so much better after I use it, I also have  fibromyalgia, arthritis and other aches and pains and it really helps my back, hands, legs etc....... Thank you, quick ship...... AAAAA+++++ seller</li>
    <li> I find this cream a great help in lessening muscle aches.</li>
    <li> After many years of \\&quot;rough\\&quot; aerospace assembly/structure line of work, I have developed severe CTS and arthritis. I&#x27;ve been told that I need surgery to fix my CTS, but being right hand dominate I&#x27;m afraid to have the surgery, so I just keep working with the pain. Sometimes the pain is so severe that I cannot function, nor sleep. I have lost strength in both of my hands and I loose grip often to where I&#x27;m always dropping things.      I shared my pain to my massage therapist and she told me about Topricin, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. IT REALLY WORKS! It is not an instant relief. It took about a week of daily use (3-4x) before I noticed, wow, I&#x27;m not having the pain like I was having. When I am in pain, I use the cream 4 or more times a day. I always put on the cream at night, and when I am in extreme pain, I take ibuprofen to help ease the pain too. I have shared this cream with two of my co-workers who have similar problems and they both had the same positive results as I have.    I used to buy Topricin at a local health food store and it&#x27;s pretty pricy. Here on Amazon, I found the same quantity for almost half the price, so order it if you have the same problems. If asked, I would be gladly to be a spoke person for this company...lol</li>
    <li> Very, very fast shipping speed. Very good product. This Topricin cream comes in a 4 oz. jar, and is easy to open. It does work extremely well for a variety of ailments; including-but not limited to sore back and arthritis. And it does so quite well. You don&#x27;t have to use a great deal of it at one time; but you must rub it in-and not just to the sore place, but to the surrounding areas as well. Use it a couple of times a day; as recommended, and it works! Very fast turn-around from Vitacost if you re-order. Worth every penny not to have the pain!</li>
    <li> Besides pure Arnica extract in olive oil which is super messy, this product has greatly relieved my aches and pains and made my muscles more supple and recover easily. I greatly recommend it for back aches and forearm aches and pains.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant - how could a cream help when my ankles or wrists hurt? Well it does! I can&#x27;t even explain it, but I feel relief when I use it. I put it around my ankles most often before I go to bed and I don&#x27;t have a hard time falling asleep.  It is wonderful.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful cream, I love it.</li>
    <li> Really Works. Excellent Product and Seller. A+++++</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Topricin for years and have nothing but good things to say about it. Fantastic for backaches, wonderful for fresh injuries of muscles, tendons and the like. I used it when my finger was smashed by a metal hospital table and the bruising went away within 24 hours. I am currently using it for tendonitis of the ankle and would probably be in an orthopedic&#x27;s office if it weren&#x27;t for the Topricin. I also use it for headaches-just rub a little across my forehead and it eases up the pain. My 84 year old Mom used it for the severe arthritis in her knees and hid it from her grandson who would visit and try to use it all up when his joints hurt! A very little goes a long way so it is more economical to purchase the jar size. I can&#x27;t speak as to its effectiveness for scoliosis and more severe joint issues but it may be helpful for some suffering these circumstances. It won&#x27;t hurt it, doubtless, because it is all natural. No bad smell and non-greasy as well. All in all, swear by it and keep some on hand at all times.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good and no smell so that is a huge plus.</li>
    <li> This cream works well for arthritis pain. I have tried a lot of other creams and ointments that didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and sent it to my aunt as she was paying way more than I could get it on here.  She was thrilled with the price and loves using this cream.</li>
    <li> Good to the last bit in these comforting containers!  It&#x27;s a good buy compared to Arnica gel or cream tubes.</li>
    <li> I use this cream to treat a tendonitis in my elbow and it makes a different. Also, it absorbs easily and it is odorless. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I use this occasionally before bed because it does leave a residue.  It&#x27;s very effective when used with massage, physical therapy, and hot or cold water therapy.  It&#x27;s also provides some relief when used alone.  I&#x27;ve used PENETREX, which I also like, but topricin is just as effective, costs the same, but you get twice as much with the 4oz pkg.  I&#x27;ve reordered it for continued use.</li>
    <li> My mother told me about this product and I really didn&#x27;t believe her.  My husband has gout and tendonitis and this stuff really works.</li>
    <li> Have been using for years.</li>
    <li> i bought the  foot pain relief it has 3 more ingredients and i use it on my back and knees.</li>
    <li> Works very well for my wife and myself. We won&#x27;t use anything else . A very effective topical pain reliever !!</li>
    <li> I had a knee replacement a year ago and I still have pain.  I rub the Topricin on my knee at night before I retire and it seems to help</li>
    <li> I have a stiff back.  With the use of this product, the stiffness subsided.  I would recomend for arthritis pain.</li>
    <li> Not sure as of yet that this product will do the trick for my spouse&#x27;s achilles tendonitis but we&#x27;ll see if I upgrade rating after we use the whole container couple times a day.</li>
    <li> I like the texture of this to spread on my arthritic joints.  It really helps reduce the discomfort.</li>
    <li> I have knee, shoulder and lower back pain and when I do I have found over the years that Topricin works the best for me. It&#x27;s quick to apply. It&#x27;s not greasy and it does not smell. The best part is it works and works fast. Whether I am at work or at home I can easily apply a little bit and work it in and within minutes I get relief. I keep Topricin at work and at home. No sting from menthol. No smell just a nice cream that numbs the pain from my shoulder while I work at my computer, my knee when I have stood in one place too long or my lower back pain from walking or standing too long. I use one and only one pain reliever. Topricin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical at first BUT…..&lt;br /&gt;It really works.&lt;br /&gt;I use it all the time and have recommended Topricin to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> The best way to describe my experience is that the product takes the edge off my arthritis pain.  I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than Aspercreme or some other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I love to play games on my PS3 and PS4 but hand pain limits me. I apply this cream before and after playing, and they simply don&#x27;t hurt afterwards. Remarkable stuff. Way better than other ointments that smell, which I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip, DO NOT touch your eyes until you have washed your fingertips and back of your knuckles of your index finger as this can really irritate your eyes.</li>
    <li> Although I have made hundreds of purchases on Amazon, I have never written a review on any of them. However, Topricin is the only thing that I have found to make my shingles pain tolerable, and I hope that it might help someone else. I bought Topricin to relieve tendonitis, but noticed it when I was desperately rummaging through the medicine cabinet looking for something to ease the intense pain of shingles. I read that it \\&quot;relieves inflammation to nerve tissue\\&quot; and decided to try it. It gave me a break from the intense pain, allowed me to relax. I have not seen any reviews that mentioned using Topricin for shingles, so decided to share my experience. Topricin has been a godsend for me.</li>
    <li> I bought for Fibromyalia pain didn&#x27;t help me</li>
    <li> Recommended by the elderly lady who used this.  Bought for my husband who has arthritis all over his body.  Easily rubbed and It works well as described.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. Highly recommend it. No foul smell, not greasy, took away the pain where it was applied.</li>
    <li> This is a gift for my Mother-In-Law….she says it helped her knees and arms from arthritis...</li>
    <li> I have chronic pain in my foot due to arthritis and several surgeries.  Nothing ever helped before Topricin.  I have used Lidoderm patches which cost a mint, various menthol creams, and all the over the counter oral pain relievers. nothing ever touched it.  But the Topricin relieves that pain.  I keep the jar in my bedside stand for middle-of-the-night pain. I use it before I go to work, and keep it in my car to use again during the day.  I do apply it several times a day, but it really works.  I even sent some to my Mom for her aches and she says it works for her, too.  Best part is its herbal. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> My wife has a problem with any product containing Menthol.  Topricin solves that problem for her and gives lasting relief for her aches.  This is a welcomed addition to pain relieving products and we will be keeping our supply for present and future needs.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Takes the pain out quickly!!</li>
    <li> This cream is awesome! This is my second jar. It does not take much per use, so it is relatively inexpensive compared to other topical creams. It has not odor, is easily absorbed and, best of all it, does work.I use it for osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia and general muscle pain.</li>
    <li> I use this product for neuropathy pain. It works better and has none of the side affects of any prescription medication I have used for this condition.</li>
    <li> This cream works wonders.  Not sure how but it relieves pain.</li>
    <li> I had neck surgery a couple years ago (c6 and c7 fused). I have had some pain issues ever since but Topricin helps a ton, it is about the only thing aside from pills that has seemed to help any. I will have a few jars of this in my house for the rest of my life most likely.</li>
    <li> This product worked well in helping pain from nerve pain.</li>
    <li> For at least four years, I have used Topricin Anti-inflammatory Pain Relief and Healing Cream. Homeopathic ingredients promote healing, as well as relieve pain. I use once or twice a day for arthritis. Topricin has no odor or fragrance and does not stain. In the winter of 2010, I slipped on ice and broke my coccyx. As the bones were knitting back together, I used Topricin for pain relief and to help heal injured tissues. Physical therapists use arnica montana, one of the ingredients, to treat bruises.</li>
    <li> Product works as stated on package. Fairly effective in treating the tendentitis in my shoulder. Would recommend for similar problems.</li>
    <li> I find this to be one of the better products on the market.  Have tried just about everything, including products from Europe, and this provides relief.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Been using it for years. Greaseless odorless non-staining.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me.  I suffer from knee and leg pain and have tried many OTC products.  This is no better than Aspercreme.  Tropricin is very expensive for what it is.  The four ounce jar lasted 14 days with once daily application.  That works out to be nearly $1.50 per day.  Very expensive for very little benefit.</li>
    <li> It works fairly well, but is much too expensive to use the recommended 5 times daily.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my aunt with severe neuropathy.....she says it helps immensely.  This arrived the next day...the price was great !  Thanks again, amazon</li>
    <li> this seems to work a little better than biofreeze, which I thought was fantastic.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product relieves a lot of my fibromyalgia pain.  Especially the skin and soft tissue pain.  Helps bruises disappear fast!</li>
    <li> I had read that this product worked on feet that burns and t&#x27;s in pain.  It doesn&#x27;t even touch it and acts like lotion.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone who has any type of pain.  I have other areas of pain and it didn&#x27;t work for that either.[[ASIN:B000EOR49W Topricin Cream 4 Ounces]]</li>
    <li> Great product, I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
    <li> The BULLY Diabetes has caused Peripheral Neuropathy in both of my feet.  Usually, they are just ON FIRE, but ocasionally, they are on fire with a village of gremlins stabing them with needles.  I&#x27;M NOT KIDDING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try an oral medication that was suppose to relieve the pain, but all it did was made me dizzy.  This was for just one pill, with the idea was to take more pills every day until you could &amp;#34;tolerate&amp;#34; 6 or 7 every day. Because of that experience, I suspose LYRICA is a medical option in which I am not interested.  Of course I may eventually have no choice because I can&#x27;t take statin drugs for chlosterol like Crestor and Lipitor because statins tend to cause my neuropathy pain to increase to the point where I can&#x27;t even walk.  Not even Topricin can help at this level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, it is CARBS, not pure sugar that causes my neuropathy to flair up.  Frankly, I would probably be in trouble without Topricin.  I certainly would be in a lot more pain and a lot more frequently without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Topricin is the only thing that I have found, that releives my pain from Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy in about 15 minutes after the initial application.  Sometimes, I may need to apply the cream two or even three times, but it always eventually relieves and allows me to accomplish things like walking and sleeping......</li>
    <li> Great for sore muscles and joints.  I like the convenience of the jar which makes it easy to use every last bit of the cream.</li>
    <li> All the same it does not seem to have any significant effect over aspercreme or other such remedies for sore feet or knees.</li>
    <li> I put this on my lower back and it really helps with nerve pain and muscle spasms.  I have ordered many Jars.</li>
    <li> Hands, wrist, neck, lower back ... this cream worked wonders on injuries and arthritis.  I have never used anything like it, fantastic results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a longtime user of the cream, so there&#x27;s nothing new to say except that it arrived safely</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing.... My mother had to go to the ER with her knee and she can&#x27;t tolerate pain meds and this stopped her pain in it&#x27;s tracks.... I has also helped me so much while I am awaiting knee replacement, and believe me..... I have tried so many things!!!</li>
    <li> I use this, Aspercream, and CTCreamPlus. As I age, none of them solves my problem. I am learning that exercise, low inflammation food, icing/heat, and aspirin all are essential to staying flexible.</li>
    <li> This helps my joint pain.  Feels smooth, too.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd jar of Topricin as I use it for my Rheumatoid on a daily bases. Works great on knees, and elbows, plus other joints that are painful.</li>
    <li> A cream that really works!! Odorless, also not greasy, and it does the job... what more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> I have tried almost every kind of joint pain cream on the market.The patches as well.I have to say this one really works for me.Now its no miracle cure but it definitely relieves my joint and muscle pain form sports and routine workouts and exercise .The main thing it not greasy at all and it does not smell what so ever.Definitely give it a try.</li>
    <li> I have only used a couple times, I am impressed with the results. I have not used enough to be convinced that it actually works. But i would recommend it due to what i feel could be great benefit. I will know more after used for longer period of time.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. It&#x27;s a great way to alleviate specific pain points in lieu of oral NSAIDs (ibuprofen or naproxen). It starts out like a lotion and you can rub it in deeply for a mini massage. It&#x27;s especially good on aching joints, old injury spots and neck muscles that trigger tension headaches.  There is no smell and you don&#x27;t have to worry about accidentally getting it in your eyes like you do with Ben Gay/Icy Hot/BioFreeze. Topiricin isn&#x27;t typically found on drugstore shelves. I originally got it from my Chiropractor, but it&#x27;s a better deal thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> love it. generally i don&#x27;t believe in homeopathic remedies but this stuff is super for aching joints. i use it frequently.</li>
    <li> got for hubby&#x27;s feet, after two days of use I asked him what he thought as he had not said anything, and he responded that his feet felt great after the first use, and insisted upon using every night-no more neuropathy.  And he is very suspicious of any of my holistic suggestions....</li>
    <li> My wife has varicose veins from multiple kids, and when they itch it drives her nuts! They are also painful at times and it can make her want to do nothing but sit on the couch. I bought this to try and help. The first time she used it, it stopped the pain and the itching within 5 minutes. Now whenever the veins hurt she reaches for the Topricin.</li>
    <li> Not experiencing the pain relief I&#x27;d expected with the product, but it is a nice creamy texture with no smell which is nice in it&#x27;s own right.  But since i bought if for pain relief, I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my sister who has nuropathy in her feet that caused her much pain. After using it 4 nights, she noticed the pain was gone. She stopped using it, and will only use it if needed, which hasn&#x27;t happened yet..  She showed her Dr. and was raving about it. The Dr. was happy to hear something could help her, because my sister doesn&#x27;t like to take meds. The Dr. said she would tell her other patients about it that are having the same problem and are getting no results with other treatments. Thank you for this wonderful product.[[ASIN:B00172HEAY Topricin Pain 8 Ounces]]</li>
    <li> I have developed a sensitivity to biofreeze after using it for years, so I decided to try this.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me.  The seller was very prompt, so I have no complaints about this.  The product may work well for others just didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> it more than met my expectations !!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product may help some users, but it didn&#x27;t help me—not at all. A complete dud, I&#x27;m sorry to say.</li>
    <li> The cream works great because it really lessens the stiffness, and pain and swelling in my elbow. It&#x27;s easy to apply and no lingering odor.  I really love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my Plantar Faciitis issue.  I have not used it much but it sure does not seem like it helped at all.</li>
    <li> I was told about this product so I decided to try it ,found it on Amazon at a much better price than at a local health store here  so&lt;br /&gt; far I am very happy with the results .</li>
    <li> Because there isn&#x27;t a strong odor, it can be applied throughout the day as needed.  Reduced the amount of pain pills I had to take in half.</li>
    <li> WOW&lt;br /&gt;I had serve burning pain from shingles and topricin relieved it in less than 4 hours after starting to use it.hope this helps with anybody having shingles.</li>
    <li> I use this cream on sore muscles after running. I seems to shorten my recovery time, and take away the pain faster.</li>
    <li> This is the best naturopathic pain relief on the market . Arthritis, herniated disc and bone spurs in both knees have been helped. Also for leg cramping this is the only thing that works and it is immediate.</li>
    <li> Great product; works great for my CTS, and other body aches and pains. It&#x27;s just what I needed</li>
    <li> Although this product is nicely packaged, it did not work for me at all.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working slowly</li>
    <li> I choose this product because my husband has nerve problems in his legs so he gave it a try.  It helps calm the symptoms&lt;br /&gt;so he can rest better at night.  We have already recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I have used Topricin for many ailments,,but mostly arthritis in my hands, feet and hip.  I would recommend it to anyone that suffers from any kind of aches and pain.</li>
    <li> This product, along with Traumeel, seem to be the two top homeopathic analgesic creams available after doing exhaustive research. I have tried both and felt that Topricin had more effect than Traumeel for my condition - (unusual sciatica). After deciding to go with Topricin, I have been using it regularly for a year along with regular chiropractic treatments and gym workouts. I can only say that the condition has improved over time and that there are no side effects at all. Topricin seems to help and I can feel it diminish nerve tingle on the skin after application. Therefore, it can&#x27;t hurt and it seems to work, at least enough to keep up regular use. Hope it works well for you.</li>
    <li> Topricin is an excellent product, which I have been using for several years now.  I sent this order to my son, who has also found it to be good.</li>
    <li> This is a flat out good product - especially for lower back - have ordered more than once - will do again - and the price is fair</li>
    <li> the product is excellent. Even my Dr recommends it. I will tell others about it and how well it works.</li>
    <li> Best topical cream ever used</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference...</li>
    <li> This product did nothing to dull the pain in my hands or feet. Didn&#x27;t touch my arthritis or carpal tunnel. Wasted my money on this one. If it can&#x27;t dull the pain of arthritis, I can&#x27;t possibly see how it would help anyone with fibromyalgia.</li>
    <li> My mother&#x27;s Neurologist recommended this for diabetic neuropathy and lower back pain. It&#x27;s worked well for her. I recently damaged a nerve in my shoulder and after using Topricin for two days I felt better. After five days my pain was gone!</li>
    <li> This cream works! I bought mine at The Vitamin Shoppe because I needed something right away and the store is close by. Within minutes the I got relief from the horrible burning pain in my knee. I&#x27;ve tried several nerve creams, but most contain some type of menthol or menthol-like ingredients that really irritated my skin. Topricin is soothing and there&#x27;s no funky scent. The only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t last a long time. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have alot of pain and haven&#x27;t found anything that really worked until I tried this. Will be buying more...</li>
    <li> Great price, okay for arthritis but I was hoping mor a more marked diference.</li>
    <li> We use this cream for muscle aches, etc.  We get two jars for the price of one as sold in our local health food store.  Great product and great buy from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This items works really well.  And have recommended it to many of my friends.  But because of the price increase, I&#x27;ll have to purchase it elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Snake oil. the cream  does nothing for pain that Ben gay takes out., will request refund. my skin my stay moist thats it.</li>
    <li> Not sure anything comes under love...like this very much and think it very helpful.  I hate ads that keep jumping back at you pushing under-quality things, so this is a Yes.</li>
    <li> My wife has a sore back a lot of the time and this cream seems to take away most of the pain. Very easy to apply and works in just a few minutes.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical.  I thought this was just another smelly, greasy cream that did nothing.  I was very, very wrong.  This stuff really does work.  I have achey legs and feet due to arthritis and this (used twice a day) relieves the pain and allows me to get a better night&#x27;s sleep.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I like it because it work,s is holistic,  and it means I don&#x27;t have to use so many ibropofen or  prescribed pills for pain. I was sceptical at first but I am a believer now !!</li>
    <li> There is no improvement in my neuropaty in my feet,legs and hands after 12 rounds of chemo-therapy.  After reading the a lot of rave reviews, I thought I would have some improvement.  I have used it as directed for about a week</li>
    <li> My patients love it!&lt;br /&gt;Very good for reduction of post-surgical bruising.&lt;br /&gt;Shoulder surgery patient had deep purple bruising, gone in one week with daily use.</li>
    <li> It really works on my pain in my annkle and knee&lt;br /&gt;It goes on easily and was sent it quickly</li>
    <li> It works well for my arthritis in my hands.</li>
    <li> I did not find it to work on my bad knee.&lt;br /&gt;This seems to help muscle aches if they are minor.&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy again</li>
    <li> A doctor recommended this cream to me for muscle pain. It works great as well as being fragrance free, and non-greasy. I don&#x27;t have to worry about it rubbing off onto my clothing. I just wish it was less expensive, it&#x27;s hard to find in stores in my area.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have had several injuries and tried every cream/ rub out there (that I have come across) I have work for a Dr&#x27;s office that also does homeopathic care. Anyway, this has NO smell, dries quickly and leaves no residue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a couple of months now and can really tell a difference.  I was in a bad car accident many years ago that left me with severe back &amp; neck problems.  I deal with lots of inflammation on a daily basis.  A lot of that is in my trapezius muscle at the base of my neck and tops of shoulders.  I feel that this cream really does help stop the pain within a matter of minutes.  Works great right out of the shower! Give it a try and hopefully it&#x27;ll work for you too!</li>
    <li> Great  product! It really works. Rub it on the area that works  and will  have  relief  in minutes. Try it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Topricin Cream for a few years now &amp; I am so glad I found it. It has really, really helped me. I work on a computer for over 8 hours a day and my hands were in so much pain from using the mouse and keyboard so much I couldn&#x27;t stand it. I started to use this cream on my hands &amp; it started to help with the pain very quickly. I continue to use it regularly &amp; my pain is all gone now! It has also helped me when I had pain in my neck. I love it &amp; I highly recommend it to others! It has been a real life saver for me.</li>
    <li> Not sure this cream works totally as described but not a bad cream. Probably won&amp;#34;t buy again in the near future.</li>
    <li> Ok...  I don&#x27;t usually believe anyone when they hype up a product.  But this really is the bomb!  This does wonders for many types of aches and pains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Dad and Father-in-law, both suffer from back/nerve issues.  Both have dealt with pain for a long time with no relief.  Within minutes of 1 treatment, the pain was relieved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it on aches and pains as well.  I find that it does a great job on nerve related pain.  Not as well with muscle pains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be purchasing more...  After my first purchase...  I purchased bottles for my Dad and Father-in-Law.  Everyone is happy with it!</li>
    <li> This cream is truely rapid and a soothing relief for joint pain. I use it mainly on my wrists and knees.</li>
    <li> This cream also comes in a foot cream which worked well on my tender, Morton&#x27;s Neuroma . Works well on sore areas.</li>
    <li> topricin cream continues to be the best for arthritic knees. I always buy multiple jars each purchase. highly recommend this product. l also love the foot cream</li>
    <li> using it for quite a while on different sorts of issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Lower back pain&lt;br /&gt;2.  Arthritis in finger joints&lt;br /&gt;3.  Knee pain where cartilage has had surgery&lt;br /&gt;4.  Neck pain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news:  It is greaseless and rubs in well.  It is a more natural form of pain relief than most remedies.  It feels good to massage it into the affected area.&lt;br /&gt;The not so good news:  It didn&#x27;t seem to do much for my various forms of pain, other than the relaxing massage.  I suspect that the pain was about to lessen anyway after all the time I applied it, whether I used it or not at that point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll finish up what I have, but I doubt that I&#x27;ll re-order.</li>
    <li> Got it for my husband, seemed to work for awhile. But he&#x27;s not the best at trying things for any length of time. He wants everything now, now, NOW!!!!</li>
    <li> Great for shoulder, fasciitis pain and neck pain</li>
    <li> No measurable effects on diabetics foot.  May need more consistent application than what I did.</li>
    <li> mix with a little rich body cream for a smoother application. First tingles, then soothes.</li>
    <li> Great for fibromyalgia and has no odor. Works better than any other product like this I have used and is naturopathic.</li>
    <li> If I could eat and drink this stuff I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I used this, my knees were so sore, I did not think I would be able to run again.  After this, I can run a 4 minute mile - not really, but the pain is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No smell, not oily or greasy.  My 24 year old weight lifting son uses it, and swears to his weight lifting buddies how great it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could buy stock in the company, I would.</li>
    <li> We recently learned of this cream, and after trying it have ordered a number of more jars.  We have found it very effective</li>
    <li> I first learned about Topricin on a health blog comment.  I ordered it and have been very pleased with the jar of cream.  It works for pain and for itching.  I recommend to others all the time.</li>
    <li> I was referred to this product by a long time friend who just happens to be a world class powerlifter... he swears by it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only seen the tubes of it &amp; they were about the same price as this jar.  sidenote: i was told that the FDA made them change the label due to some claims.  The 4 oz jar is label foot cream, but is supposed to have the same ingredients as the original product.  I don&#x27;t know if this is a fact or not.  I simply took it at face value.</li>
    <li> Good for fibromyalgia and arthritis pain, and is creamy and comfortable on dry skin.</li>
    <li> GREAT JOINT PAIN RELIEF ALSO WORKS WELL FOR ABRASIONS AND OR SKIN IRRITATION</li>
    <li> I have been using Topricin on my knees and neck for several years.  I like that it isn&#x27;t greasy, and does not have an order to it.  It works well to help relieve pain in muscles and joints.  I will keep on using it.</li>
    <li> This really does seem to work,,,,,,,,,,,I have used it on my arthritic hands and on sore back muscle and did seem to make a difference...........at this point I am a happy customer.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really impact my carpel tunnel or neuropathy.  Just another cream.</li>
    <li> Relieved the pain in my knuckle joints. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> Like this stuff,no need for prescription.Works very well on the site.No noted order either like some leave.It works rapidly which is comfort.Works great on relief of strains,pinched nerve in my situation.</li>
    <li> great for arthritic pains</li>
    <li> I have has extreme pain in my feet for the past year and a half or so.  I have had shots in my feet, been told to keep my shoes on all the time.used a boot to help with plantar fasciitis, I have neuropathy as well. I have just about given up when I heard a commercial for this on the radio. I was across the street from the drug store mentioned grabbing some lunch, so I figured that was a sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is thank goodness for signs!  This has allowed me to walk without excruciating pain for the first time in a long time. It hasn&#x27;t taken away all of the pain, but I would estimate that it is at about only 30% of its previous level. My feet also &amp;#34;buzzed&amp;#34; when I laid down to go to sleep, and it would keep me awake for hours some nights. That aspect of my foot problems has almost completely vanished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. My feet feel so much better than I ever thought they would.</li>
    <li> This product works somewhat.  However I have recently tried a product on Ebay called &amp;#34;Simply Kool&amp;#34;.  It works better than Topricin.  Relieves the pain and cools my burning feet and costs much less.</li>
    <li> I first heard about this cream from a co-worker who swore by it.  I was having some pretty bad pain around my thumb on my left hand. It felt like someone was holding a match to my palm.  I thought I would try it and see if it could help with the pain.  I am on my second jar and can&#x27;t believe the difference!  The pain has lessened quite a bit and I don&#x27;t feel the shooting pain that I was having going up my arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on in the morning and then again before I go to bed.  I just found out that I have arthritus in my neck and shoulder from having an MRI done.  I have decided to use it there and see what happens.  If it helped the pain in my hand I am hoping it will do the same for my neck and shoulder. I highly recommend this product, so glad I gave it try!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff! I was told by a friend that it would help my stiffness with my sciatic nerve hip leg issues it helps keep the pain under control! there is no smell and non-greasy. it also absorbs very fast.</li>
    <li> Topricin cream works great. Its hard to find in most drug stores and was very happy to be able to get it on Amazon at a great price. If you suffer from Arthritis or any other muscle pain give this product a try,you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> i use this product as a foot cream for my mother who has neuropathy related to diabetes. It absorbs well, not greasy and seems to alleviate some of her nerve sensitivity</li>
    <li> Everybody needs a container of Topricin cream.  I have arthritis, and this product(with arnica montana as the main ingredient) is wonderful.  When you apply the cream the pain relief is almost instantaneous.  There is no odor, and no worries of accidently touching some tender area with bad consequences.  I also use it on other members of my family for muscle pain with the same great results.</li>
    <li> Never heard of this stuff until I read about it on a discussion site. Seems to really help my intense sciatica.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a bit expensive but works well for my husband&#x27;s hand pain.  I&#x27;ve used it also but just helps me a little bit.</li>
    <li> I certainly wanted Topricin to work on my hamstring origin tendon injury.  But after 4 applications a day for a week, it had no detectable effect on my pain.  I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s just snake oil.  Avoid this product and its dubious claims.</li>
    <li> A massage therapist introduced me to this stuff.  I&#x27;ve used it on chronic pain from sources as varied as TMJ/TMJ/bruxism, shoveling snow, lifting weights, bad keyboard / laptop habits, bursitis, and whiplash from a car crash.  I&#x27;ve bought the 8 oz. pump, the 2 oz. tube, and the 4 oz. jar.    I highly recommend this product if you have muscular pains from overworking or straining the soft tissues in your body, such as muscles and tendons.  It doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, but it is a noticeable help for many.    For example, when my thumb-to-wrist area was in pain months ago (before I switched from a laptop to a desktop at work), I put some Topricin on the entire area.  In less than 10 minutes (probably about 2), I realized that my pain levels went from a 6 out of 10 to about a 4 out of 10.  I was stunned.  That was fast, noteworthy, and had no obvious side effects.  No stomach issues, such as pins can cause.  No smells or obvious residue, such as Tiger Balm.  Its not even visible.    Currently, I&#x27;m recovering from a car crash.  I put this over as much of my back and sides and neck as I can reach each morning (after a shower) and each night (just before bed).  It helps.  The only side effect that I&#x27;ve noticed is that when I shower it sort of \\&quot;reconstitutes\\&quot; very slightly and needs some extra soap to wash off.    You can use this up to 4 times per day, but I find that I usually don&#x27;t need to.  Its not a cure-all and it won&#x27;t remove all pain.  It will reduce that pain by about 2 points on a scale of 10 for me, though.    Keep in mind that each body is different.  The above is my personal results.  I&#x27;ve shared Topricin with friends and coworkers.  Some find it useful enough to buy.  Others say that it helped but then don&#x27;t buy any.  A few people have noticed no difference.  Personally, it seems to not help my TMJ very much, but it does help shoulder, neck, back, and hand (especially wrist and thumb) pains.    One last thing:  Follow the directions.  You have to spread it over the pained area plus about 3 inches around it on all sides.  If its a joint like a knee or elbow or thumb, go all the way around the joint.  Heat will \\&quot;destroy\\&quot; the application (so don&#x27;t use it with an electric blanket) but cold will \\&quot;pause\\&quot; it (so you can use it during the winter).</li>
    <li> I purchased the Topricin cream mainly since I have so many areas that are painful, including low back, ankle, knee, elbows, and I don&#x27;t want to take drugs that cause side effects.  After using the cream about two days, I had an episode in the night with a painful leg cramp, and to my great delight, when I applied the cream, the pain from the cramp or \\&quot;charlie horse\\&quot; immediately ceased.  I have been applying the cream to the other areas that are painful several times a day, and I do notice some easing of symptoms, but I believe that it will probably take some time to make much difference.  At least, I feel the price I paid for the product was worth the relief I obtained.  Will report back later if my other symptoms are relieved substantially.</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly and provide much in the way of skin care.</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing. I have been using this for several months and have shared my experiences with so many other people that they are now  using it and having relief from their pain and  discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it it works !!!!!</li>
    <li> Topricin may be one of the greatest inventions of the 21st century. I&#x27;ve had nerve compression issues for years and, thanks to Topricin, I&#x27;ve been able to keep myself from going nuts from the pain and irritation. I&#x27;ll apply it about 4 times a day, once in the morning, once at night, and once or twice during the day, and I find the pain and tingling substantially diminishes shortly thereafter, often going away completely. As an added benefit, I&#x27;ve found it softens and substantially diminishes the appearance of large scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently had surgery (for the aforementioned nerve issues) and was able to actually observe its anti-inflammatory action. I&#x27;d apply it around the incision site and could observe a visible reduction in inflammation ~1 hour later. After it wore off, the incision area began to slowly swell back up again until the next application. It doesn&#x27;t smell, leaves a minimal residue, and, if anything, my skin seems to be healthier where I apply it. It&#x27;s a life saver!</li>
    <li> This is a tremendous help with muscle and/or ligament/tendon strains. Apparently it gently dilates the sub-dermal vascular system allowing increased blood volume in the treated area, helping speed recovery and the body&#x27;s ability to rebuild the tissue. Works best if used several times/day over a period of several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> excellent,for Shingles pain. It was the only thing that really helped.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 2 weeks now and haven&#x27;t noticed any change or improvement in my arthritic condition or pain. Don&#x27;t feel it works for me.</li>
    <li> I order this frequently. Great product. Helps with my arthritis pain.</li>
    <li> This works great on my shoulder pain.  Non greasy &amp; no smell!</li>
    <li> It is what they say it is. I just have to keep putting it on.</li>
    <li> I have had pain in my legs at night for months.  After using Topricin for 3 nights my pain is gone and I&#x27;m sleeping.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing - pain releif without taking any over the counter pain medicine - how awesome is that!</li>
    <li> Second jar, helps a little with my neuropathy, but not as well as I would like. For what it costs I don&#x27;t think it works any better than bio freeze or other products. Sorry but  it is not the product I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve torn my achilles tendon and this stuff is absolutely magic !!!!  Then I tried it on my aching back and again ....magic !!!  It works and is worth every penny, but you will need to reapply as needed.</li>
    <li> This cream is easy to smooth on and it does help somewhat. But as I have fibromyalgia, I would have to bathe in it for complete relief.</li>
    <li> I love this cream!!! It really works to calm my rotator cuff and back pain and the occasional muscle sprain or strain. It is sooo goood, that I give jars of it to friends and relatives when they complain of pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So wonderful to have it now in the 4 oz jar.</li>
    <li> Very Nice quality of the&lt;br /&gt;cream. Mixture of Ayurved and Homiyopathy&lt;br /&gt;which is very food&lt;br /&gt;It would be the best&lt;br /&gt;if it will be availble on stores as well.</li>
    <li> Wonderful products - have started purchasing direct from the company in different, larger, size.</li>
    <li> Seems to work for me.</li>
    <li> Really helps. Been using for years.  Helps inflammation and pain.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Not greasy, no smell and it works!!!! My husband has painful knees and he uses this every morning and that gets him through his workday!</li>
    <li> Surprisingly effective on more than just feet.  I gave one to my brother &amp; after using it he was very happy.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended it and it&#x27;s replacing our other natural soothing cream now.&lt;br /&gt;Works great.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I&#x27;d recommend it to see if it works for you.</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing. Buy it. Hands down it&#x27;s the best pain reliever. My husband has pain in his shoulder and hip from injuries long ago and this stuff stopped the pain in its tracks!</li>
    <li> I reacted badly to several mosquito bites with redness, swelling &amp; itching. Topricin is the only cream that eased the pain.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great as an anti pain ointment.  I use it when torn rotator cuff &amp;#34;flares up&amp;#34;  Take 650mgm Tylenol and 200mgm of Advil and rub on some of the Topricin and have relief withint 10-15 minues  Cheaper to buy on line from dealer that does not charge shipping than to buy at Whole Foods or Mom&#x27;s</li>
    <li> My 91 year old mother loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> Relieves pain quickly.  And pain stays away.  Just like it says it will.  Amazingly good.  Great with arthritis and other aches.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the product. along with Benfotiamine (for neuropathy) which lets me sleep all night.</li>
    <li> This is the most effective cream/rub-on that I have ever used to provide relief to sore&lt;br /&gt;achey, painful, muscles and in 76 years I have used quiet a few. It provides almost instatanious relief with no greasy residue&lt;br /&gt;and with no odor. It is worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is a very effective muscle cream and has no scent for those who are sensitive.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many analgesic creams in my life time that either didn’t work or only minimally worked. So I  was pretty surprised at how consistently well this product delivered pain relief. It takes my knee pain away instantly, even before I am finished applying it to my knee!!&lt;br /&gt;This effect lasts a long time &amp; if needed I reapply. There is nothing toxic in this product. There is no odor either.&lt;br /&gt;In the middle of the night when I  wake up with severe knee pain  I fumble around in the dark, locate my Topricin cream &amp; apply to the pain and I  am back to sleep within minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this every day for a week and it has not failed to produce relief.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my mom who swears by it. She uses it for her arthritic hands and fingers and she says it gives her great relief.</li>
    <li> I use this cream all the time. It really helps with arthritis pain in my shoulders and joints. Great for all kinds of inflammation and pain.</li>
    <li> Both Penetrex and Topricin have as a main ingridient arnica, which is a natural NSAID.  The main difference I see so far is that Topricin comes in a 4 oz. jar and Penetrex in 2 at about the same price of less than $20 (Topricin is cheaper).  Both give immediate temporary relief.  Topricin claims healing powers, which I haven&#x27;t found after two months use.  I bought Prologel (haven&#x27;t received yet) that is a product devised by a doctor who performs prolotherapy.  Since prolotherapy was effective on my tennis elbow condition, I thought I&#x27;d try the gel on my shoulder.</li>
    <li> i loved this product ,it worked great on my osteoathritic knees n tennis elbow  after a day of sports by reducing the pain n swelling without any side effects ,smell or greasy feeling .it worked better than voltaren which i need a  doctors script for n is very expensive n can have bad side effects</li>
    <li> Topricin is quite helpful for some chronic pains and injuries - not all though.  It&#x27;s good to have on hand for those that react to it as its effects are immediate.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! Safe, almost instantaneous relief from sciatica &amp; bursitis! Not greasy &amp; no smell. A miracle in a jar!</li>
    <li> Amazing cream really helps relieve pain. Fast shipping. Great vendors.</li>
    <li> This Cream is amazing. It works very well. Relieves stiff shoulders and sore muscles an is unscented so you can use it without the world knowing you have issues :-)</li>
    <li> I always have this on hand for any kind of back pain or&lt;br /&gt;joint pain.  I have carpel tunnel and this helps to relieve&lt;br /&gt;the pain and stiffness.</li>
    <li> It is easy to apply, does not smell, but unfortunately did not relieve the pain.&lt;br /&gt;My wife tried it as well and it did not help relieve her pain either</li>
    <li> I received this product, as I&#x27;ve come to expect from Amazon and its affiliates, 1 day before it was due. Everything was included and I&#x27;m sooooo grateful to not have to go even 1 day without the way to cope with arthritis pain and knee pain due to surgery.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to use for neuropathic pain I have as a result of pain from multiple sclerosis. I was &amp;#34;googling&amp;#34; one day and saw this product and decided to try it.  Believe it or not, it works. It dulled the pain I was having along with wrapping up with my electric blanket. Yes, electric blanket.  Most products cannot be used with heating devices but this one I could.  I now receive correspondence from the company and look forward to ordering more products from this brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this personally and found that it really works when nothing else will. I picked it up years ago at the suggestion of someone in Whole Foods when I was in a lot of pain after being in a bus accident. When my flatmate broke her toe but still had to perform in a singing and dancing musical, I pulled it out. The swelling decreased very quickly and although she went through my tube in a week, she spent that week performing. It was rather spectacular. I used it in a massage on my sister&#x27;s sore back without telling her that I was using anything but regular lotion and she immediately noticed that her pain had gone away. She shared with my parents and now all of us swear by it. It&#x27;s worth trying. If you read the reviews, it works very well for most, and doesn&#x27;t work at all for some. Every person&#x27;s body chemistry is a little different, and there&#x27;s no &amp;#34;catch all&amp;#34; but this scores very highly. Like so many products,, it&#x27;s expensive if it doesn&#x27;t work, but priceless if it does.</li>
    <li> It was recommended by a Friend that delt with chronic Pain.So did my Husband and myself.So we decided to give it a Try,and it worked.</li>
    <li> My acupuncturist got me started on this as a pain reliever.  I have arthritis pain in my hands and this stuff helps. .</li>
    <li> This does help to take the achiness away. I do like that it does not have any odor. It was shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> I know the product, It works well.  Purchased for much lower price than local food co-op sells it for.  Arrived in timely manor.</li>
    <li> this product absolutely amazing-any thing sore on your body will be relieved within thirty minutes-i keep a full jar with me always</li>
    <li> Did not seem to help.At least it did not ssmell or have to wash hand after using it.</li>
    <li> I suffer from arthritis and am always looking for products that will make me feel better. Sometimes I feel it helped and others times I didn&#x27;t. I used it as directed using it daily. One thing I like is that you can use it and it doesn&#x27;t have a smell!</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. This was my second order.</li>
    <li> I would recommend Topricin to anyone with muscle pain.  If it is massaged well into the muscle it relieves the pain completely.</li>
    <li> One of the best homeopathic topical son the market</li>
    <li> I use Topricin for neck pain, varicose vein pain. Also bruises, sciatica and my husband uses it for neuopathy in his feet. Been using TPR cream many years and I find that Amazon is the best place to purchase it. I rate this five stars. Love it.</li>
    <li> So safe, I literally ate an entire bottle. I would have given it a 5 but the taste was only OK.</li>
    <li> Excellent for neuropathy pain</li>
    <li> It works great and does not smell. It is easy to use and you don&#x27;t have to worry about rank odor.</li>
    <li> IT  W O R K S  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  BEST BY FAR .. GREAT FOR LEG CRAMPS , SPRAINS , PULLS , ARTHRITIS AND GENERALLY ANY SORENESS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE TYPE OF PAIN</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve have had several serious spine surgeries including a full fusion with instrumentation, for novices that means around 14 screws and rods inserted in the back. Early after my full reconstruction, two of the screws broke but had to be left in for the 3 year recovery, and then removed with another surgery.  As a result of these back surgeries, I suffer from instense nerve damage, chronic pain, and advanced spinal and neck stenosis.  Topricin is the ONLY cream that brings a significant measure of relief from the pain,stiffness,and soreness. I still have pain, but with Topricin I have a broader range of motion, and my muscles are not so tight so I can walk with greater ease. It does not smell nor stain your clothing; but most of all it works! I highly recommend Topricin, it&#x27;s not just a panacea, it really helps heal injured tissue and provides a rather miraculous decrease of pain. Believe me, I&#x27;ve tried every ointment and salve out there, this THE ONE!</li>
    <li> My husband brought Topricin home for me to try 2yrs. ago.  I am so happy he did. I use it for neck, shoulder, foot, and back pain. It works really fast!  I bought it for  my 83 yr. old dad and mom to try for various pain issues they have and they were both very happy with the results.  Now I make sure none of us runs out of Topricin.  I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to get away from prescription pain meds.  It&#x27;s all natural ingredients won&#x27;t harm you either.  Thank you to the person who figured out how to make Topricin!</li>
    <li> This product has been so good that I shard it with friends and had to order more for myself.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for sore muscle or sore toe.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve tried so many products in the past 3 months for the arthritis in my hand. every topical cream i&#x27;ve tried has been a disappointment. the capsaicin cream i tried: outside in the sun in summer, my hand felt like i lit it on fire. didn&#x27;t expect that outcome. i&#x27;ve avoided the aspirin creams as i&#x27;m allergic to aspirin, &amp; didn&#x27;t want to take the chance, even topically. i find this to be effective in lowering the level of pain, &amp; allowing my hand to be more nimble. i apply it 4 times a day. i appreciate the fact that it has no odor, &amp; isn&#x27;t sticky. worth it? yes. miracle cream? no. but it does help.</li>
    <li> Great for soreness or overuse of muscles, as well as for repetitive motion inflammation. I use it on my back, neck and shoulders, and wrist and hands. Always have it next to my bed to use in the evenings after a long day.</li>
    <li> This truly is an amazing pain lotion. First it has no smell to it and it actually works and works fast.</li>
    <li> This product has brought relief to a long standing problem with my elbow.  I use it twice a day.  Took only a few weeks to see results.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Great cream for sore muscles, highly recommended, works when I need it.</li>
    <li> The cream so far has done well.  I haven&#x27;t had it that long, so I&#x27;ll update my review in a couple of weeks. I just finished my first jar and ordered another.  I had a great and surprising benefit.  I had psoriasis on both legs in the ankle area.  My dermatologist had taken biopsies because I had skin cancer on my scalp. The result came back as psoriasis.  While I was rubbing the cream on my nerve pain, I started working the cream into the psoriasis just as an experiment.  To my surprise and delight, it cleared all of the dry skin and red blotches away.  My legs are clear and smooth.  I&#x27;m no doctor, by any stretch of the imagination, but it worked.  Thank you Topricin.</li>
    <li> Good product - it&#x27;s working for us.</li>
    <li> Same great product but getting a little expensive for good results, it doesn&#x27;t work for everything as they want you to believe.</li>
    <li> Bought with a recommendation from a friend who is a nurse.  Awesome.  Relieves back and knee almost instantly!!!😃</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a personal trainer.  I use this and have recommended it to all my clients as well.  It just works!  I had shoulder pain that seems to stem from a possible impingement.  It helps the inflamation go away.  That with ice and I&#x27;m good to go.  Anyone use it for muscle cramps?</li>
    <li> we have tried several salves and ointments with liittle if any relief from the pain. we even tried several pain releiving drugs with very little relief if any. when the wife goes to play golf we use topricin and reenforce it with  2CVS pain relief tablets(acetaminophen) it works wonders.</li>
    <li> I read some really good reviews and I just had to try it even though I was somewhat skeptical.  I am here to say it really helps for recovery from soreness and general aches and pains.</li>
    <li> I used this twice dayly on my elderly&#x27;s mother&#x27;s knees this past winter.  It helped relieve her pain and now that her pain has been reduced she makes sure I apply it twice a day.</li>
    <li> This product did not work at all to provide any relief for my spinal stenosis.  I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Truly love this product.  Helps with my sciatica.  Not a miracle cure, but relieves my discomfort for a little while.  Use it daily.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years. It not only works on tender spots, but I&#x27;ve found that it helps to stop itching and sting from burns.</li>
    <li> I am using as per instructions of my chiropractor.  I think I am going  to like it..I will continue to use it..</li>
    <li> Ordered this product for the second time.  One for me and one for another person.  Instant relief from pain to allow going to sleep easier and also helps alleviate chronic pain for a period of time.</li>
    <li> If you put this on 3xday it works.  I am managing thumb joint pain with it and it really helps.</li>
    <li> my mom is using this cream  she says that it help to ease the pain  in her knees a friend  of mind told her about it</li>
    <li> I fractured my ankle and this cream was giving for the pain, this is my second jar and really do the job.</li>
    <li> Have used topricin before.  It is wonderful</li>
    <li> Even better than the tube of same, and a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> This cream was recommended to me by a runner friend. It&#x27;s really soothing for aching or pulled muscles! Bought one for a friend and he was happy with the results too!!!</li>
    <li> My latest massage therapist recommended Topricin, so I ran off and bought the 4-oz jar for $26 and for three days I tried using the Topricin for the nerve pain in my calf.  Yes, it did work but left a vague and nagging ache instead of clearing the pain away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, happily I was already using an excellent product, a homeopathic ointment called Traumeel.  I find it a great product.  It is a white cream and odorless.  The pain goes away in 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So each day I waited about an hour and then washed off the Topricin and applied the Traumeel instead.  Each time the Traummeel more cleanly took away the pain.</li>
    <li> i have bone spurs on my lower back, and this cream lets me make it through the day until i get home</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my daughter who suggested that I combine it with equal parts of DMSO gel to get relief from chronic pain in thighs and knees.  It is important to use it consistently.  In my case I use it three times a day and sometimes in the middle of the night so that I can sleep.  If I neglect using it for 1 or 2 days, the pain returns.</li>
    <li> Great product for aching feet and back</li>
    <li> HELPED MY PAIN BUT NOT ENOUGH .</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my mom who swears by this cream. She&#x27;s been using it for some time and says she gets the best results&lt;br /&gt;of any other cream she&#x27;s ever used. It&#x27;s resulted in less pain for her and that&#x27;s amazing because she has arthritis very bad. So we are&lt;br /&gt;very happy that she can get some relief using this product.</li>
    <li> I cannot keep enough of this cream on hand. I have oseteoarthritis.&lt;br /&gt;My friend is bone on bone with severe Knee and joint pain.&lt;br /&gt;I have to buy two Jars so I can have mine and he can have his.&lt;br /&gt;This product is pain relief in a Jar. I rub my knees and my feet.&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from Plantars in my foot and it helps relieve pain there.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a Jar in Florida for my daughter who has been recently&lt;br /&gt;diagnosed with Arthristis and has pain in the back and front of her knees.&lt;br /&gt;She said this cream has helped to eliminate that pain.&lt;br /&gt;For inflammation sufferers this product is a must have.</li>
    <li> I found this product in a shoe review on Amazon. I have achiles pain after long runs and hill work. This seems to be of great help. I have also used it on knees and I have reordered because my wife has started using it for her back pain.</li>
    <li> Topricin Cream is a really good buy.&lt;br /&gt;The whole family uses it for aches, sprains,&lt;br /&gt;and tired muscles.  Would recommend it to anyone&lt;br /&gt;needing pain relief.</li>
    <li> Product arrived right on time and was packaged well. It was a bit more greasy than I expected, and it didn&#x27;t do much for my tennis elbow pain. I don&#x27;t doubt that it works for others, but I am sticking with BioFreeze.</li>
    <li> I use this to relieve pain from arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome. It is not available at my local pharmacy. The first time I bought it, I had them order it for me, and they make a complicated mess of the ordering process.</li>
    <li> It works, help relieve and prevent leg and foot cramps, tired legs and feet.  Works to relieve arthritic pain, in the knees for me but you need to use daily and consistently.  It brings relief.</li>
    <li> Has kept me pain-tolerable for several years. I hope the company continues to sell this forever. I expect to live a long life.</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier than expected. BTW this is a great product at a great proce.!!!</li>
    <li> My husband and I do CrossFit and it is grueling but we love it and it gets us results! However, we regularly have sore muscles, joints, and occasional bruises and Topricin is THE ANSWER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it instantly dull the pain but it also heals the issues beneath the skin. Most aches and pains only need a treatment or two but even the worst tears like a meniscus tear in the knee healed in 4 or 5 applications over the course of three days. I can&#x27;t express how awesome this stuff is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth EVERY penny!</li>
    <li> I am a regular user.  I strongly endorse the product &amp; appreciate the fine service from this suppliers.</li>
    <li> I have been using Topricin for about a week and I find it does help me quite a bit.  I have Arthritis in my lower back which generates into my right buttocks. It has helped relieve the pain quite a bit. I know this kind of pain is difficult to address but, I think your product is the best solution I have found so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Roberta Adams</li>
    <li> Works wonderful for carpal tunnel issues and when overdoing it in the garden. No odor and easily rubs in.</li>
    <li> It came highly recommended by several people.  I just happened to be one that it had no effect on.  It doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for others.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on the recommendation of a friend. I was suffering for months from plantar fasciitis. I rubbed it over my heel and arch at bedtime and wore socks. It did help somewhat. Recently, I used it when I pulled a muscle in my back and it sorta helped but not a lot. Do not put it on broken skin - it is very painful.</li>
    <li> Topricin cream really works well to relieve pain from arthritis and also helps with discomfort from restless legs. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have a BAD back  L4 L 5 and without this I can&#x27;t make it through the day sitting a work! I also rub on my plantar fascias and it helps!</li>
    <li> After every time i play basketball, i apply this straight away. It does not take away the inflammation for me nor the pain that i experience post basketball on my knees.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it lives up to the hype.  I used what I had but have no plans to reorder</li>
    <li> good price-fast delivery</li>
    <li> I am having arthritis problems in my ankles, when a flare up occurs I have to go to my ankle doctor for a steroid shot deep into my ankle. Topricin penetrates well and has eliminated the need for a steroid shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m totally amazed by the results.</li>
    <li> definitely helps my lower back pain</li>
    <li> I have  severe chronic pain it really does not work for me. I tried using on surgical scars had better Luck with a CBD cream. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I wish I never bought it.  Normally reading reviews is good...not this time.  This stuff does ABSOLUTLY NOTHING.  It may as well be lotion.  DON&#x27;T waste your money....so disappointed!  Back to Sombra, it may stink but at least it helps for a while.</li>
    <li> Bought this cream for severe carpal tunnel syndrome- which was eventually fixed with surgery- and realized I had half a bottle leftover. I started using this on my baby and toddler when they get bumps and bruises from falls. It&#x27;s amazing how the redness and inflammation goes away so quickly when using this product. I&#x27;ve even used it on my baby for diaper rash, and myself for cooking burns and bruises.  Love this product- in fact- I&#x27;m buying more today.</li>
    <li> This product is AWESOME.  the seat in my car had been clipping my nerve in my leg causing my back to be in spasms.  I was walking hunched over and looking like an 90 yr old man at 45.  With in 3 days 2 x a day i was up and sprint walking where the heating pads and other ointments didnt work..</li>
    <li> I bought two jars; one for my sister who has nerve pain and one for my leg cramps. My sister has gotten some relief for the pain in her feet &amp; legs. i love the feel of the cream &amp; even though I don&#x27;t have cramps on a regular basis, it has helped when I do need some relief. Only four stars because of the price.</li>
    <li> this product works as well as Bio-freeze, but without the green mess.  It&#x27;s odorless, colorless and doesn&#x27;t wreck your clothing.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I apply this cream on my hands at bed time.  It has been helping to reduce pain in my fingers and hands.&lt;br /&gt;it does not reduce the swelling of joints.</li>
    <li> There is something special about this cream.  It is the only product that has worked for me to reduce pain.  I would recommend this cream to anyone since it is all natural, and it has no odor.  Works great on my wrists when I am on the computer too long.</li>
    <li> I like this because it has no odor, its not greasy and most of all, it helps!&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Australian  Dream is by far better.</li>
    <li> best product for bruises and pain</li>
    <li> I use it preventively and as a remedy.  When my knees ache, I rub it on and I get relief.  I also follow instructions and use at bed time.  It seems to work, so I continue to buy it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years now and am satisfied.  Though nothing can make me feel perfect or be a permanent solution, Topricin does what it advertises.</li>
    <li> It sure helped my painful foot! (the top) I can walk again.</li>
    <li> Might work for someone that just has a slight sore spots, but didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I guess I&#x27;m to far gone.</li>
    <li> I had forgotten how good this is. I had an old jar in the cabinet, a couple of years old, and as soon as I put it on, the pain of my aching joints went almost completely away. Better than ibuprofen, and faster. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love Topricin cream. I have been using for many years.  I use it for all my aches &amp; pains. It is easy to put on &amp; without the odor. Use as directed and get quick relief!</li>
    <li> Too soon t tell. I only used it a few times, although, I think it will do what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> This cream works very well on muscle pain, absorbs quickly, odor is pleasant.  It does not work on joint pain.</li>
    <li> best product for pain relief</li>
    <li> I got your products about 8 years ago for my dog grooming daughter, she loved it.  I called your company at that time and you couldn&#x27;t have been nicer when I told you how much we liked your product.  My 92 year old friend is using it on his knees and loves it.  Thanks for a great product</li>
    <li> Topricin is the absolute best cream to relieve pain from Fibromyalgia as well as back pain. It is my #1 go to product. It contains very old tried and true remedies that any herbalist would know and recommend. TRY IT, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST pain relief cream of gel that I&#x27;ve ever experience. I&#x27;ve had chronic pain due to various forms of arthritis, fibrillation, and polymyalgia for over 40 years. I&#x27;ve had joint replacements, carpal tunnel release, pain pump installation, vertebrae fusions and other surgeries as a result of the arthritis. However, I&#x27;ve never used an ointment, creme or rub that is as good as Topricin.&lt;br /&gt;Don Banks</li>
    <li> I think this product works well. I&#x27;m telling people about this cream.</li>
    <li> Helps my arthritic pain.</li>
    <li> Not sure it did much.  Maybe after 2 weeks there was some effect.  Having to apply 4 times a day is a challenge.</li>
    <li> The best antipain cream i have used in years! Nit greasy. Helps with all kinds of bruises, pains, bumps and strains. Great price and great product!!</li>
    <li> this is a heavy cream that helps tendon/muscle/bone pain and helps aid the healing process.  and it works!  worth the cost.  we&#x27;ve purchased 3 now.  and will keep this one around!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I use it everyday to help take care of my knee pain.</li>
    <li> Great product for your feet</li>
    <li> I have tried a wide variety of products to treat muscle pain.  This one works best. The previous leader was Tiger Balm.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine gave me a couple of sample packs of this and I threw them on my desk like \\&quot;lol yeah I&#x27;m sure that will help\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks later I was having some pretty bad back pain and so I asked my boyfriend to put it on my back, figuring why not, I didn&#x27;t expect much.  Next thing I know I realize the pain is gone.  I bought a container immediately, and I now recommend it to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> Great but toooo pricey</li>
    <li> I have arthritis in my foot which seems painful sometimes, and other times it is not painful.  I use the Topricin every day, and I think it does help.  Of course, it is hard to say for sure because I don&#x27;t know how the foot would feel without the Topricin, so how can a person compare?  If nothing else, it&#x27;s the placebo effect. I tried Penetrex, not so sure about that one, but it&#x27;s about $20 for 2 oz. and the Topricin is about the same price for 4 oz.  Sometimes I wonder if it&#x27;s the massaging in the cream which helps, but I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> I have relatives that swear by this.  My experience is it is a placebo.  Voodoo magic homeopathic medication.  You might as well wave your magic wand to be rid of your pain.</li>
    <li> An acquaintance turned me on to this, my back, neck and shoulders were killing me. This stuff really works, no joke!</li>
    <li> It works great if you follow the instructions on how to apply it correctly.</li>
    <li> I have only applied it 2x&#x27;s so I can&#x27;t make an thorough/accurate comment yet!</li>
    <li> Good stuff.....it works...no odor.</li>
    <li> great stuff!  works so well!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, it really helps my arthritis.</li>
    <li> Works wonders on achy legs. Even releases my restless leg syndrome. All ways have some at home and on trips.</li>
    <li> All I can say is fantastic! It relieves muscle pain within minutes and lasts a few hours. I have even used it on m temples at the onset of a tension headache with good results. It doesn&#x27;t work as well on bone pain.</li>
    <li> Was skeptical at first but this really did work. Non- greasy and odorless it penetrates quickly.</li>
    <li> Another recommendation from a massage therapist that was well worth the purchase!  I expected little results and received much relief from knee pain!</li>
    <li> so far its the best solution for my siatica pain and restless legs.</li>
    <li> I tried this because a friend recommended it.  I have basal thumb arthritis, and this is the best treatment -- even better than synvisc injections.  I am a believer.  And in addition, I have found it helpful with muscular pain and arthritis in my shoulder.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Helps with my morning joint pain.</li>
    <li> We love Topricin, but anyone using it needs to realize that it takes time to have an effect. It was a month of regular use before we noticed the pain had totally disappeared. Now we use it for maintenance, and it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> This product kept me out of physical therapy.  It works wonders on a burn.  Should be in everyone&#x27;s medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> My mother-in-law gave me a sample of Topricin to see if it would help with my fibromyalgia.  It is the ONLY thing I&#x27;ve ever found to give relief.  Pain relievers don&#x27;t touch the pain.  It is also a wonderful relief for restless legs.  Our family calls it &amp;#34;pixie dust&amp;#34; because we can&#x27;t understand how it works so well, but my husband, children, and I have found all kinds of relief from various soreness and pains with it.  I feel like taking to the streets with advertising signs for this stuff, I love it so much!</li>
    <li> I use this for my wife&#x27;s upper back problem.  She feels much better after one week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I have used this on my back and legs and it hasn&#x27;t really helped much but I&#x27;m not giving up because the Foot Therapy version works very nicely.  I will use this up and then switch to using only the Foot Therapy version which I&#x27;m sure can be used all over the body as well as the feet.</li>
    <li> My Dad likes it, so I like it.</li>
    <li> It is the correct item ordered and arrived as promised</li>
    <li> The cream arrived SUPER FAST, and it made my aunt very happy because she swears by Topricin to relieve her aches&lt;br /&gt;and pains (she&#x27;s 90 years old).  I will always order from this company.  Thank you!!  :)</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for years and loved it.  The last jar I received does not work.  It seems to have no active ingredients at all.  I also noticed that the lid on the jar is different - the new lid is very thin, flat and sharp.  I have applied it several times over the last week and found it to be completely worthless.  I don&#x27;t know what changed, but unless I can purchase the original cream, I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Great stuff my husband uses it every day. Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff - works better than the regular cream, we use it for shoulders and lower back pain.</li>
    <li> First time using this product and I like it quite a lot. I use it for occasional muscle pain in the metatarsal area of my left foot. Along with a Thai balm I use on top of the Topiricin it really does help. I know the Topricin helps because the pain is relieved much faster than before when I used the Thai balm alone (the balm really helps with getting a good massage grip).</li>
    <li> This is a homeopathic remedy.  As I understand it - and I&#x27;m sure someone will correct me if I&#x27;m wrong - the idea behind homeopathy is to take a substance that *causes* the symptoms to be relieved, and dilute it until it&#x27;s a tiny proportion of the product to be used.  This sounds almost like the way conventional western medicine&#x27;s vaccines work, but don&#x27;t be fooled.  This is a different principle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people are adamant that homeopathy is a more natural, gentler way of treating disease than conventional western medicine.  Others are just as adamant that it&#x27;s quackery.  I don&#x27;t want to take a stand on that, but I do suspect that as dilute as these \\&quot;active ingredients\\&quot; are, the only *harm* that any homeopathic remedy is likely to do is to your pocketbook.  I suppose that if you have a life-threatening condition, trying a homeopathic remedy might keep you away from more conventional treatment that you desperately need, but that would be your own choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my complaint - foot discomfort - is far from life-threatening, I gave this stuff a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be an effective (if pricey) moisturizing cream.  I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have any perfume in it.  However, after applying it several times daily over a week, I couldn&#x27;t detect any analgesic or anti-inflammatory effect at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mean to suggest that others here are experiencing nothing more than a placebo effect.  However, I wonder if at least some folks&#x27; relief might be a result of the massage they&#x27;re getting as they rub the cream into the affected area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s try this: If your particular problem isn&#x27;t one that other reviewers here have reported some success in treating, I&#x27;d suggest that you consider the cost of this product carefully.  What you have here is something very, very close to 100% water, coconut oil, and glycerin.</li>
    <li> Great stuff for those achey hands and feet.</li>
    <li> It works on my pain.  I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> have used this product for years. no odor, no greasy film and it relieves pain in my joints and muscles without fail.  tired of taking prescription pain pills that end up messing with your liver and kidneys.</li>
    <li> Works great. I used it on my roommates strained ankle from running and it felt better over night after several days of no change. I rubbed it into my sole of my plantar fasciitis affected foot and it started feeling better in minutes and it seems to be helping the healing which had been very slow.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had an opportunity to use this product.  My sister told me it was an excellent product so I bought it to try in the future.</li>
    <li> Works great have been having knee problems for a month usedcream 2 days it&#x27;s gone</li>
    <li> Topricin seems to be the only product that works for arthritis in my feet and knees.  I just ordered more on Amazon about a month ago and one jar for me last around 3 months.  I was using Tiger Balm for a long time and it helped a lot but now I seem to be getting better results with Topricin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for another person so I do not know how it works.  I am trold it works well but it was only received yesterday so there hasn&#x27;t been much time to see really how it works.</li>
    <li> Topricin is as good as other pain relievers that I have used.  And at a cheaper price.</li>
    <li> This is a repeat.  Love this stuff.  Works for me as I&#x27;m very arthritic and chronic low back pain.  It relieves my sciatic nerve issues.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a reflexologist to help relieve heel pain.  I have used it for various muscular aches and pains.  After a few minutes you can feel the difference.  Another thing that I like is that there is very little odor.</li>
    <li> I use this for tendonitis. I use it before and after my workout. It helps calm my tendonitis down. I feel it work right away. My Zumba instructor uses it for her tendonitis. She teaches 4 classes a day and it keeps her going. I&#x27;m not completely pain free but it helps.</li>
    <li> My elderly mother has been using this homeopathic cream as an aid for her arthritis pain.  Finding good prices on Amazon is always a plus too.</li>
