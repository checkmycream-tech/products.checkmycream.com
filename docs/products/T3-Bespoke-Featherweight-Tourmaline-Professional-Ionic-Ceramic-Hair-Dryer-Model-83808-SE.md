### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had it for about 6 months and the air coming out of it is lukewarm at best.  </li>
      <li>It was awesome, but after 3 years I started having problems.</li>
      <li>It is an excellent hair dryer.</li>
      <li>but it was perfect</li>
      <li>This is the BEST hair dyer ever.   </li>
      <li>, it works better than the one I got from the salon!!!</li>
      <li>I am very good at getting a salon quality blow-out at home.  </li>
      <li>It worked great for about 6 months.</li>
      <li>The dryer works great, however the item is refurbished and was not said anywhere on the seller&#x27;s website.</li>
      <li>I love this hairdryer!</li>

      <li>THIS BLOW DRYER IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST</li>
      <li>Everyone has their own opinion, and let&#x27;s face it</li>
      <li>I was able to get a brand new, perfect T-3 for 64.95 from discount jungle!</li>
      <li>it also looks shinny and healthy.   </li>
      <li>But you Amazon reviewers now rate the BabyBliss better than the T3.</li>
      <li>I will say that investing in a good dryer is worth it.</li>
      <li>The company wanted even more money to repair it........</li>
      <li>Phenomenal price and even better delivery time.</li>
      <li>I love this dryer.  </li>
      <li>When it first arrived I loved it.</li>
      <li>For those of you considering buying one, I would STRONGLY discourage it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very good dryer, as long as it works.</li>
      <li>This was fine until it&#x27;s 2 year birthday</li>
      <li>It drys my hair silky smooth and gets rid of the frizzes.  </li>
      <li>While it worked, the dryer was fabulous.</li>
      <li>For those of you who have and enjoy your T3s, I understand, I did too for 11 months.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t fall for the hype - this company may have a great publicist, but the product falls short.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to get this dryer</li>
      <li>The first 3 of those years were fantastic!</li>
      <li>The first two times I used this dryer was ok.</li>
      <li>I do clean the filter and every thing.</li>
      <li>The filter is clean and I didn&#x27;t change my settings.</li>
      <li>When I bought my first T-3 I paid $220.00 at a hair salon, i was told it was hands down, the best blow dryer.</li>
      <li>Need to go back to my good &#x27;ol Conair dryer.  </li>
      <li>Using my much older drug store model which works better and dries faster.</li>
      <li>This is a great dryer, and Amazon allows me to keep my costs down.</li>
      <li>My first T3 still works, but is going.....</li>
      <li>My first T3 stopped working after a year</li>
      <li>The company will do that for stylists with great accounts for them but for the average purchaser you go through hoops to get it fixed.</li>
      <li>All hair dryers blow hot air, this one blows hot air for a large price tag.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this as a Christmas present and how embarrassing was it when the person I purchased it for said, \\&quot;well, I loved it until I used it the third time</li>
      <li>I actually have never felt so strongly about a product that I felt the need to write a review.</li>
      <li>&quot; this seller really is.</li>
      <li>and when I went to take off the concentrator the whole front of the blow dryer fell</li>
      <li>I really like the hair dryer.</li>
      <li>fast, lightweight and durable.   </li>
      <li>This is a great dryer while it works, but at 200 a pop, I expect it to last longer than a year, and I only dry my hair 2-3 times a week for 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>I was able to put it back together but had to snap parts back in place.  </li>
      <li>&quot; I guess we&#x27;ll see how \\&quot;highly rated\\</li>
      <li>If I wasn&#x27;t so busy, I would send it back and demand a full refund.  </li>
      <li>This dryer had normal use (5 or 6x/week).</li>
      <li>I started using the old dry again and noticed a huge difference on how my hair felt.</li>
      <li>The BabyBliss has a lot more power than my old T3 and scares my long, thick, frizzy hair straight and smooth in 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;d just get a new one.</li>
      <li>My step-dad borrowed my first one and never gave it back.  </li>
      <li>It also does not get hot enough, so</li>
      <li>The only positive thing I can say about it is that it is lightweight.  </li>
      <li>As if I&#x27;m going to give them any more of my hard earned money.</li>
      <li>I bought it for about $200 and thought it would last for much longer than that.  </li>
      <li>And today it stopped working completely.</li>
      <li>I cleaned the filter frequently but didn&#x27;t seem to help.  </li>
      <li>Do not waste your money on this brand</li>
      <li>And the other posts are right - Bespoke is NOT covered by warranty by T3 - a complete rip off.</li>
      <li>My then 2nd T3 worked for a year broke, and my back up (the repaired first T3) lasted 2 1/2 months.</li>
      <li>I agree with the first review, I bought the same dryer and it only lasted for eight weeks.  </li>
      <li>I had the exact same one for 6 years, but it finally blew up</li>
      <li>My first broken one, my hairstylist was able to send back for me on her account and they fixed it and that became my back up.</li>
      <li>My friends made fun of me for spending so much, but I have thick hair</li>
      <li>after you have spent 30 minutes blowing your hair dry, it looks like it is still damp and has been blown out with a super market dryer.  </li>
      <li>I hear it&#x27;s a great blowdryer though...too bad.</li>
      <li>Before I make a purchase I generally like to read the reviews, but I do take them with grain of salt.</li>
      <li>Since I only use it about 3 times a week, I expected it to last much longer.</li>
      <li>The first one lasted about 3 years, using it everyday.</li>
      <li>I certainly didn&#x27;t want to pay 200.00 dollars again but the drug store dryers were not powerful enough for my hair......</li>

<li> However, I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair every day.</li>

<li> Not only does my hair dry in half the time</li>
<li> It was definitely softer and less frizzy.</li>
<li> My friend bought a Chi for about the same money, (maybe less)</li>
<li> To late now to return as my old dryer burned out.</li>

<li> I don&#x27;t find that it dries your hair any faster than any other model.  </li>
<li> Not worth the hassle.</li>
<li> I have owned this dryer previously and was looking to acquire a replacement but had wanted to shop this out</li>
<li> It dries my hair in half the time of the T3 and no burnt hands.</li>
<li> It think the previous, less fancy hair dryer lasted 5 years.  </li>
<li> so I thought long and hard before forking out</li>
<li> It broke after about a year of little usage.</li>
<li> I had this hair dryer for 3 years - so a little longer then others on this post.</li>
<li> I was a little nervous till I got it</li>
<li> Only lasted a year and blew out only cold air.</li>
<li> It dried my hair even faster than the T3.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it!  Lighter th!an I thought a dryer could be.  Lives up to it&#x27;s reputation...dries my  thick hair in record time</li>
    <li> I have had 2 T3&#x27;s in the past three years, well technically three. My first T3 stopped working after a year and I purchased a second. My first broken one, my hairstylist was able to send back for me on her account and they fixed it and that became my back up. My then 2nd T3 worked for a year broke, and my back up (the repaired first T3) lasted 2 1/2 months. This is a great dryer while it works, but at 200 a pop, I expect it to last longer than a year, and I only dry my hair 2-3 times a week for 15 minutes. So, unfortunately I would say look elsewhere until they fix it. My former stylists owns a salon, they only use T3s however, she is constantly sending 3-4 of them back at a time to be replaced. The company will do that for stylists with great accounts for them but for the average purchaser you go through hoops to get it fixed. Not worth the hassle.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a Christmas present and how embarrassing was it when the person I purchased it for said, \\&quot;well, I loved it until I used it the third time and when I went to take off the concentrator the whole front of the blow dryer fell apart.\\&quot; I guess we&#x27;ll see how \\&quot;highly rated\\&quot; this seller really is. He hasn&#x27;t responded to my email still!</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer for $200 with the T3 volumizing lotion and Orlando Pita styling brush.  I have never been so disappointed in a \\&quot;salon quality\\&quot; hair dryer.  I am a blow-dry addict who watches my stylist closely when he blows my hair dry.  I am very good at getting a salon quality blow-out at home.  I used this product for 4 months, and it is sitting in the back of a drawer now.  If I wasn&#x27;t so busy, I would send it back and demand a full refund.  I feel like I was duped.  The strength of the dryer is poor, which results in dry fly-aways.  It also does not get hot enough, so after you have spent 30 minutes blowing your hair dry, it looks like it is still damp and has been blown out with a super market dryer.  I have used the babyliss and solano hair dryers in the past, and am going back to them.  Don&#x27;t fall for the hype - this company may have a great publicist, but the product falls short.</li>
    <li> The dryer works great, however the item is refurbished and was not said anywhere on the seller&#x27;s website. To late now to return as my old dryer burned out.I am stuck with another case of dishonesty from a merchant.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good dryer, as long as it works. It broke after about a year of little usage. I bought it for about $200 and thought it would last for much longer than that.  Only now I read it is NOT COVERED BY MANIFACTURER WARRANTY!!!  I would not buy it again, unless the manifacturer started covering it for at least 2 years.</li>
    <li> I paid twice the price listed here at Amazon for this dryer at a local health and beauty chain.  The only positive thing I can say about it is that it is lightweight.  I&#x27;ve had it for about 6 months and the air coming out of it is lukewarm at best.  I have terrible breakage close to my scalp, all over my head, which sticks straight up and looks ridiculous.  I asked my hairdresser about it and he said it was likely related to my blow dryer. I agree, since I have never had this problem before.  I don&#x27;t find that it dries your hair any faster than any other model.  As for your hair staying \\&quot;healthier\\&quot;, I&#x27;ve never seen mine in worse shape!   I&#x27;m ordering a Twin Turbo (the only my hairdresser uses) to replace this subpar product.  Extremely disappointing.</li>
    <li> Before I make a purchase I generally like to read the reviews, but I do take them with grain of salt. Everyone has their own opinion, and let&#x27;s face it we&#x27;re not all going to agree. I actually have never felt so strongly about a product that I felt the need to write a review. That is until now. I can&#x27;t stress enough how disappointed I am in this dryer. I work hard for my money so I thought long and hard before forking out $[...] for a dryer 11 months ago. When it first arrived I loved it. It did what it said it would, it dried my hair faster, it was quiet and lightweight. My friends made fun of me for spending so much, but I have thick hair and I thought of it as an investment. I purchased it on February 8, 2008. Today is January 27, 2009 and my dryer is BROKEN. It overheats and sparks. This dryer had normal use (5 or 6x/week). [...].     As if I&#x27;m going to give them any more of my hard earned money. No thank you Bespoke labs. I will say that investing in a good dryer is worth it. Ask any hair stylist. My friend bought a Chi for about the same money, (maybe less) I tried it, and frankly I preferred it. It dried my hair even faster than the T3. For those of you who have and enjoy your T3s, I understand, I did too for 11 months. For those of you considering buying one, I would STRONGLY discourage it.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is overpriced for the value.  I dropped it and pieces went flying.  I was able to put it back together but had to snap parts back in place.  Not worth the money, wish I would have got a less expensive hair dryer.  All hair dryers blow hot air, this one blows hot air for a large price tag.  Not impressed.  Would not recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> When I bought my first T-3 I paid $220.00 at a hair salon, i was told it was hands down, the best blow dryer. It was awesome, but after 3 years I started having problems. I certainly didn&#x27;t want to pay 200.00 dollars again but the drug store dryers were not powerful enough for my hair......so my daughter encouraged me to try amazon. I never thought i would find the T-3 on amazon but to my surprise I did find it! I was able to get a brand new, perfect T-3 for 64.95 from discount jungle! I was a little nervous till I got it but it was perfect, it works better than the one I got from the salon!!! I feel like I got the deal of my life!</li>
    <li> Only had the T3 dryer for a few months and it started shorting out while I was drying my hair.  I cleaned the filter frequently but didn&#x27;t seem to help.  Need to go back to my good &#x27;ol Conair dryer.  I had a Conair dryer for several years before I had to replace it.  Although, I will say the T3 dryer controlled the frizz...when it worked.</li>
    <li> I agree with the first review, I bought the same dryer and it only lasted for eight weeks.  It began fizzing and spewing sparks - very scary for a hair dryer.    Do not waste your money on this brand - it&#x27;s very low quality and not worth the investment.</li>
    <li> fast, lightweight and durable.   This is the BEST hair dyer ever.   Not only does my hair dry in half the time it also looks shinny and healthy.   I love this hairdryer!</li>
    <li> Simply put.....it&#x27;s overpriced and over-hyped. Only lasted a year and blew out only cold air. The company wanted even more money to repair it........NOPE!! Not another penny will they get from me.  Using my much older drug store model which works better and dries faster. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I had this hair dryer for 3 years - so a little longer then others on this post. However, I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair every day. I spent about $180 on this hair dryer. It was an investment. It worked great for about 6 months. The other 2 1/2 years it worked as well as a dryer you can get at the drugstore. And today it stopped working completely. I do clean the filter and every thing. So I don&#x27;t recommend investing in this. And the other posts are right - Bespoke is NOT covered by warranty by T3 - a complete rip off.</li>
    <li> THIS BLOW DRYER IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST I HAVE EVER OWNED!!!  MY NIECE ASKED FOR ONE AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT AFTER USING MINE.  THERE SIMPLY IS NO BETTER BLOW DRYER OUT THERE, AND I HAVE TRIED THEM ALL!!!</li>
    <li> My blowdryer came to me defective so I can only give it 1 star. I hear it&#x27;s a great blowdryer though...too bad.</li>
    <li> The first two times I used this dryer was ok. Now every time I use it the motors sounds like it is bumpi g something and about to. Low up. I was so excited to get this dryer but instead I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer once before for myself.  My step-dad borrowed my first one and never gave it back.  This hair dryer is the bomb.  It drys in half the time and does not damage my long hair.  It drys my hair silky smooth and gets rid of the frizzes.  I consider it a miracle.  You have to see it to believe it.  So convenient.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer.  I had the exact same one for 6 years, but it finally blew up so I got another...</li>
    <li> I have owned this dryer previously and was looking to acquire a replacement but had wanted to shop this out sinceit is pricey for a hair dryer.  Phenomenal price and even better delivery time.</li>
    <li> This is my second T3.  The first one lasted about 3 years, using it everyday. I purchased another Ionic Tourmaline hair dryer, and used it for 3-4 months.  My hair felt like straw. My first T3 still works, but is going.....I started using the old dry again and noticed a huge difference on how my hair felt. It was definitely softer and less frizzy. I have now purchased another T3.  This is a great dryer, and Amazon allows me to keep my costs down.</li>
    <li> It is an excellent hair dryer. This is the second one we have purchased!</li>
    <li> I really like the hair dryer. It was delivered in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Add me to the list of buyers who are disappointed with the short life of this expensive T3 hair dryer. One day, it just would not turn on. While it worked, the dryer was fabulous. I don&#x27;t think I even got two years, though I will have to look up the receipt. Since I only use it about 3 times a week, I expected it to last much longer. It think the previous, less fancy hair dryer lasted 5 years.  I will be buying something different next time.</li>
    <li> This was fine until it&#x27;s 2 year birthday and then it only blew cold air. Company said that they&#x27;d replace it for $114- I paid $65 for it. I will never buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> I have been faithful Bespoke Labs T3 user for the past 4 years. The first 3 of those years were fantastic! The past year, the hair dryer has been burning my hands and my hair. I don&#x27;t know what happened. The filter is clean and I didn&#x27;t change my settings. Figured this T3&#x27;s life was over and I&#x27;d just get a new one. Kinda short life for a hair dryer that&#x27;s over $100. Anyway, I went to look online. But you Amazon reviewers now rate the BabyBliss better than the T3. I was hesitant because of the weight increase. But I bought the Baby B. It dries my hair in half the time of the T3 and no burnt hands. The BabyBliss has a lot more power than my old T3 and scares my long, thick, frizzy hair straight and smooth in 15 minutes.</li>
