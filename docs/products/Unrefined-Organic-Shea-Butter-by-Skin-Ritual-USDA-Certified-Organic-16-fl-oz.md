      <li>I love shea butter</li>
      <li>love this product.</li>
      <li>Many things that claim to be organic are sometimes a bit iffy.  </li>
      <li>, try most of the product from the store for years, none of it work like the Shea butter moisturizer did.</li>
      <li>Some people use it for diaper rash, eczema, and of course many are using in on their less-than-lustrous hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Even hours later my skin feels great!</li>

      <li>Glad we found this product, will use agan.</li>
      <li>I got this product free of charge in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>

      <li>Awesome, really helped my very itchy skin....</li>

      <li>/&gt;This is a pretty amazing moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Do let it warm up in your hand first though.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for my super dry skin.</li>
      <li>I received a free sample of this product for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Give it a try, girls; it is always worth to invest in yourself :)</li>
      <li>and we are comfortable letting her use it.</li>
      <li>my hands are now crack free.</li>
      <li>I have to say it is one of those amazing wonderful smells, not sweet or perfume, just natural and musky.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also great to put on straight out of the bath with a pair of soft socks!</li>
      <li>The moisturizing ability is outstanding, and it is something I would certainly recommend.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Amazing and natural product</li>
      <li>It’s not bad or truly objectionable, but it has a somewhat off-putting scent.</li>
      <li>He said it smelled a bit like nuts, but not bad.</li>
      <li>Even more so, I use this as a chap-stick and it leaves my lips soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>It goes on fairly smoothly - the company recommends you put some in your hands first and rub them together to apply.  </li>
      <li>The Shea Butter rubbed in very nicely and absorbed into my skin unlike other&#x27;s I have tried.</li>
      <li>butter is often used in skin products, along with less desirable ingredients and perfumes, so getting this unrefined shea butter is great and</li>
      <li>It’s pretty solid, but it spreads fairly well once it comes up to body temperature.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no expiration date, but either keep it in a cool dark place (fridge is good)</li>
      <li>so we wanted something safe and natural and the fact that it&#x27;s unrefined and USDA organic sold us to give it a try.  </li>
      <li>If you like natural products, you probably will be okay with the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Therefore, I cannot recommend this product; I think most people will be able to find better alternatives.t much more difficult to use.  </li>
      <li>The density of this item is very creamy and rich; therefore, you don&#x27;t need a lot to achieve moisturize purpose.</li>
      <li>I immediately noticed was that USDA organic seal right on the front of the container.  </li>
      <li>we had no burn cream) and he said it relieved the pain right away and never blistered.</li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>of the main reasons I purchased this was the fact that it is also usda certified, making me comfortable with using it before and after work/school.</li>
      <li>So far love this product leaves your skin soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I read a lot of instances where people had to mix their shea butter with other materials to use it, but I was able to use Skin Ritual&#x27;s shea butter right out of the tub easily and</li>
      <li>Very fast delivery.</li>
      <li>It does not take very much at all.</li>
      <li>It may seem like a lot for $19.99, but you really do receive a lot of product!</li>
      <li>First is how it smells.</li>
      <li>it is silky smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>It is all natural and the price is relatively cheap.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this stuff! I am not 100% sold on the smell of it, but it is totally tolerable. I love the way it  makes my face feel. I have dry skin and in the winter months my face dries out pretty bad. I put this on at night after I have washed my face. In the morning my face feels great. It does not take very much at all. Do let it warm up in your hand first though. It will spread much easier as it is very thick.</li>
    <li> I love this organic Shea Butter. The smell isn&#x27;t as overpowering as some reviews have mentioned, I think it is quite mild compared to other deep moisturizers. We got this because our daughter had been complaining of dry and itchy skin on her legs. She&#x27;s quite young so we wanted something safe and natural and the fact that it&#x27;s unrefined and USDA organic sold us to give it a try.  It&#x27;s really helped our daughter with her dry and itch skin and we are comfortable letting her use it. It&#x27;s also great to put on straight out of the bath with a pair of soft socks!</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazingly think and is extremely moisturizing. It&#x27;s perfect for my super dry skin. Use it just before you go to bed so you have all night to let it soak in. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I remember when everyone went wild over lotions that had shea butter in them.  Shea butter has a lot of uses, but in this house we use it on our skin, especially during the wintertime.  I&#x27;ve already applied some to my skin, which is already beginning to dry out.  I used to favor a Hawaiian lotion my son gave me, but am now trying to stay away from heavily fragranced lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I immediately noticed was that USDA organic seal right on the front of the container.  Many things that claim to be organic are sometimes a bit iffy.  The \\&quot;claim\\&quot; is about all it is, just a promise not backed up with the seal.  I love shea butter and so do many family members.  My husband is now using it to prevent heavy cracking in his heels.  During the winter, the used of Skin Ritual Shea Butter will be a welcome addition.  You do have to be proactive and use it before the cracks set in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shea butter has an earthy, slightly wood stove-like scent that smells all-natural.  I just scooped up a small amount, and rubbed it into my skin.  It&#x27;s surprising how well it absorbs in, making that flaky look disappear.  I do love creature comforts and shea butter is one of them, especially during the winter months.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot to see fast results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shea butter actually has a soft, off-white creamy look to it.  It only takes a little bit to saturate one&#x27;s hands so a one pound container will last a long, time.  I do like the fact that the Skin Ritual Shea Butter is unrefined, and organic something that is highly desirable.  In this house shea butter has alleviated that cracked skin, but other uses abound.  Some people use it for diaper rash, eczema, and of course many are using in on their less-than-lustrous hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note, that I&#x27;ve never noticed before is a cautionary note on the tub that says \\&quot;Shea butter contains naturally occurring latex and is made from Shea nut.\\&quot;  There&#x27;s no expiration date, but either keep it in a cool dark place (fridge is good) and it should last up to two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.it should last up to two years.    Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> Awesome, really helped my very itchy skin....I put it in from of my space heater in my bathroom to soften it up...</li>
    <li> I bought this item to help with my babies eczema and ended up using it for the whole family. It works great. I made body butter using some of it and other organic oils, it&#x27;s amazing. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> It felt great on my skin it was real thick and creamy. It absorbed well and had long lasting effects. Wonderful on Dry Skin because it penetrates so well.</li>
    <li> I just love this product. This shea butter has so many uses from stretch marks, dry skin, wrinkles, chapped lips, dry hair and scalp, acne, dermatitis, eczema and burns. We tried this out at my last get togethers. It really made our hands so soft. I am going to try it on my hair next. My hair really seems to be so dry and brittle. I constantly have split ends. This would be a great gift for the holidays. I know I would love it since it has endless possibilities. I got this product free of charge in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Although this is an excellent product but I gave it 4 stars because the price is high and not competitive with similar products available in Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great dhea butter. The best I ever used!</li>
    <li> Love the way my skin feels when I use this Shea Butter! Even hours later my skin feels great! There is a little bit of a smell, however, it goes away soon after you rub it in.</li>
    <li> This is an interesting product, not at all what I was expecting. It is actually way better than what I imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start off with, this is packed in a margarine or cottage cheese tub. Immediately I&#x27;m thinking food, not cosmetics or lotion. All the organic labels on the package add to the food idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next thing to get over is how hard this is at room temperature. It is as firm as creamery butter just taken out of the refrigerator. The great news, once the shea butter reaches body temperature it is silky smooth and soft. It takes very little to moisturize, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then this does have an earthy odor. I have to say it is one of those amazing wonderful smells, not sweet or perfume, just natural and musky. After a short time the smell does go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a pretty amazing moisturizer. I&#x27;ll take a small amount, less than pea sized, and rub it in my hands. Once the butter is warm, I can then apply it to my skin. The butter absorbs quickly and nicely into my skin. It leaves my skin with a matte finish, not oily and shiny. I like using this after serums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my homemade body butter. Great product!</li>
    <li> Very Nice Product and works really nice on the skin. I would recommend to everyone. Thanks</li>
    <li> I am currently 18 wks pregnant with my 4th child. I have tried other lotions/creams/etc to relieve the itchy belly and stretch marks that go along with pregnancy. This quite possibly is my favorite. Some of the others had smells that bothered me. Others, like Bio-Oil I liked, but felt like it took forever to soak in so I&#x27;d have to wait forever to put a shirt on without having it get messy. So far this product doesn&#x27;t have those problems!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  My hands and feet have been so dry they are peeling. This solves my problems.</li>
    <li> I am a mechanic and get very dry skin in the winter and from the uniform. In the past I resorted to messy baby oil until I found this. Amazing and natural product and now it is all I used. I have also recommended it to the guys at work. I don;t have to worry about a smell either.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product and will buy it again</li>
    <li> Shea butter moisturizer is a great product. It works like it says it would. It work for my dry hair, work on my heels that was cracked, I wash my hand a lot, it&#x27;s peeling skin , try most of the product from the store for years, none of it work like the Shea butter moisturizer did. love this product. I recommended to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I have been using SR Shea Butter for months and it&#x27;s amazingly effective. Also it is USDA certified which increase my confident to purchase this item. The density of this item is very creamy and rich; therefore, you don&#x27;t need a lot to achieve moisturize purpose. Be patient and apply it daily to your skin (I usually use it after shower or before go to bed); your effort will be paid off with satisfaction. I will definitely recommend this item!! Give it a try, girls; it is always worth to invest in yourself :)</li>
    <li> Discovering this product has changed my skin(and life) forever! I am an avid supporter of organic products, I have used them for years, and this not only met but went beyond my expectations. You can immediately recognize the quality by texture and absorption alone, so much that I am using it now on my hair for deep conditioning. I actually got a compliment at a nail salon saying my hands and feet were so soft!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the main reasons I purchased this was the fact that it is also usda certified, making me comfortable with using it before and after work/school. I am a culinary student handling food and washing my hands constantly, this shea butter moisturizes them right back up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely being trying other products from Skin Ritual.</li>
    <li> NOTE:  I received a free sample of this product for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My facial skin tends toward oily, although I can still get dry patches, particularly during the winter and/or if I have overused acne products.  I also experience dryness throughout other areas of my body, from on my legs post-shaving to the rough skin of my elbows to the heels of my feet.  Traditional moisturizers can be helpful, but I had never tried unrefined shea butter before, which is why I was interested in this product from Skin Ritual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An order of Skin Ritual Organic Shea Butter comes with a free ebook explaining exactly how to use the product as well as \\&quot;recipes\\&quot; for creating shea butter blends for different purposes.  The product comes in a large tub, very similar to an actual tub of butter.  To use the product, the instructions recommend taking the following steps:  1) wash and dry hands, 2) remove shea butter from tub with a wooden spoon, and 3) allow shea butter to soften in palm before applying to desired location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given this, I found this product to be both cumbersome and messy to use.  The shea butter is VERY greasy--the manufacturer explains that once appropriately warmed and melted, it is actually an OIL, but this means that even using a tiny amount leaves a residue.  It also meant that I had to be very careful not only to avoid touching anything with my hands, but also to make sure that whatever body part I was applying it to was protected (e.g., if I put it on my feet, I would need to immediately put socks on).  And I did not find the scent to be \\&quot;natural\\&quot; at all--to me, it was lightly reminiscent of bacon grease.  Luckily, though, I actually thought that the odor was quite mild, so this was not a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason for giving this product two stars is that I did NOT think that the moisturizing benefits outweighed the negatives outlined above.  This Organic Shea Butter performed no better than an average moisturizer, yet I found it much more difficult to use.  Therefore, I cannot recommend this product; I think most people will be able to find better alternatives.t much more difficult to use.  Therefore, I cannot recommend this product; I think most people will be able to find better alternatives.</li>
    <li> Delighted with this product - will be repurchasing</li>
    <li> The smell is kind of unpleasant, but it does help dry skin feel softer. I am thinking of mixing it with some essential oils to make it smell better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product also works in a pinch to style your baby&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. My hands crack and bleed in the fall/winter. I rub this in all the cracks and crevices and my hands are now crack free. Even more so, I use this as a chap-stick and it leaves my lips soft and smooth. I have a hard time finding a chap-stick that does not make my lips worse and I have tried SO MANY. This is all natural and perfect. The whole family can use this in multiple ways.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had pale creamy yellow unrefined shea butter before. The smell might be overbearing for some, but the good thing is the it quickly fades.  It is all natural and the price is relatively cheap. When I apply to my skin it absorbs very well and a little definitely goes a long way and it lasts all day. Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever bought. It also can be used as deep conditioning treatment for your hair.</li>
    <li> My son was having trouble with winter skin, his knuckles were chapping and cracking, his face ruddy and red. He didn&#x27;t want oil or girly smelling cream. When I was offered the she butter I got it for him to try. He said it smelled a bit like nuts, but not bad. His skin got better almost immediately and he has been using it faithfully. The chapping is gone and his hands look good. I felt good giving him an organic product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shea butter is often used in skin products, along with less desirable ingredients and perfumes, so getting this unrefined shea butter is great and it worked fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sample provided</li>
    <li> Very smooth, clean product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to help with extremely dry skin during the winter.  Regular lotions just don&#x27;t do it for us here in the Northeast.  I opened up the container and it smells terrific.  Since this is a butter, a little bit goes a long way. The whole container should last for my entire family for the next few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used store bought Shea Butter Lotions in the past, but they don&#x27;t compare to the actual Shea Butter.  Glad we found this product, will use agan.</li>
    <li> I’ve been using Argan oil for some time to deal with dry hands and cracked fingertips. It has been working well, but can be a bit messy to apply since it’s an oil. This Shea butter is easier to deal with but also introduces a few issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is very smooth. It’s pretty solid, but it spreads fairly well once it comes up to body temperature. Unlike the runny nature of Argan oil, this stays put and allows me to treat just the area I want treated, such as my fingertips, without getting all over the place. (That’s also a negative, however, as noted below.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need a small amount to get good results, so a 16 oz tub, while pricey, is going to last a LONG time. The benefits are also more lasting than Argan oil, so you need to use it less often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two downsides. First is how it smells. It’s not bad or truly objectionable, but it has a somewhat off-putting scent. Unlike the earthy, musty smell of Argan oil, this has a more sharp, oil-like scent. Again, it’s not something that I would characterize as smelling bad, just that in comparison to Argan oil, it’s less appealing to my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second issue is that this is harder to spread over a large area. While the non-runny nature of the Shea butter is a plus when doing spot treatment, it works against you when you want to treat a larger area. It’s doable, but more effort is needed versus Argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good alternative or complement to Argan oil. The moisturizing ability is outstanding, and it is something I would certainly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;[Sample provided for review]</li>
    <li> My wife has terribly cracked painful heels which make it difficult to walk.  One application on her feet at night made it bearable for her to walk again.</li>
    <li> I love this amazing butter. My skin was normally dry and itchy. Once I started using the butter, it helps my skin become soft and smooth. This product is really amazing! You have try it yourself. A little goes a long way. One container will last you for a while. I will highly recommend to anyone who wants to add moisture to their skin.</li>
    <li> So far love this product leaves your skin soft and smooth. My 16yr old dripped hot(boiled) water on his foot while cooking pasta and he put some shea butter on it(as we had no burn cream) and he said it relieved the pain right away and never blistered. Can&#x27;t wait to use it on our skin throughout the winter as my boys are multiracial and tend to get ashy in the winter months.</li>
    <li> Skin Ritual shea butter evens out my skin tone, and it is not greasy as others that I have bought before.</li>
    <li> When, I first received this item in the mail and took it out the box, the first thing I noticed was the packaging. The container it is in is a very well made container, and I thought the label&#x27;s looked very professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used unrefined Shea Butter&#x27;s in the past, so I was expecting it to be sort of hard. However, Skin Ritual&#x27;s Shea Butter was nothing like that. It was very creamy and soft. The first place I tried it out was my arms. The Shea Butter rubbed in very nicely and absorbed into my skin unlike other&#x27;s I have tried. I was really impressed by this. Not only that, but it gave my skin a nice glow. Shea butter usually has such a greasy feel to it in my opinion. However, once I rubbed it in, it didn&#x27;t feel that way at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for awhile now, and I notice my skin is not only glowing, but so much softer! If you have tried all sort&#x27;s of lotions and moisturizers for dry skin, then you have to try this product. I guarantee it will make your skin softer, because it certainly did mine. Another bonus, is that it doesn&#x27;t clog your pores so you can pretty much use it anywhere. It may seem like a lot for $19.99, but you really do receive a lot of product!</li>
    <li> For the longest time, I have a few dry/itchy spots on my legs. I tried several creams but nothing really worked well. Then my friend suggested me to look into shea butter, and I&#x27;m glad I did. It&#x27;s got a really smooth and creamy texture, has a nice nutty scent (not the artificial smell), and melted easily in the palm of my hand.  My itchy patches stopped itching and the redness are going away!  I&#x27;ve been using it every night ever since to keep my skin moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did my research and made sure that the shea butter I got was was unrefined.  I read a lot of instances where people had to mix their shea butter with other materials to use it, but I was able to use Skin Ritual&#x27;s shea butter right out of the tub easily and right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this shea butter.  The USDA Organic Certification is also very assuring!</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery. I&#x27;m surprised.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s better than I thought.&lt;br /&gt;a small amount goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This Certified unrefined shea butter FEELS healthy.  It goes on fairly smoothly - the company recommends you put some in your hands first and rub them together to apply.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my face now that cold, dry weather is here and it immediately feels nourished by the buttery texture.  When I awake in the morning, the skin feels soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great to put on your feet, too, before going to bed, and elbows and other dry patches of skin on your body.  The scent is slight - very natural and non-perfumey.  If you like natural products, you probably will be okay with the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am enjoying using the sample this company sent me to try.  Will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> During the last year or so my skin has turned extremely dry.  So dry I scratch daily and make myself bleed.  This Shea butter has done wonders in just a few short days.  My skin is soft, moisturized and no longer itchy.  A small amount goes a long way.  Being organic is a plus.  No long list of chemicals on the label.  Love this stuff!    I was provided a discount on the product in return for my unbiased feedback.  The review, thoughts, and words are my own.</li>
    <li> Really great product. My husband and I have been using it to moisturize our faces at night due to its non pore clogging abilities. A little bit goes a long way. It&#x27;s also a great lip balm!</li>
