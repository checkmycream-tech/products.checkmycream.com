### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The shape is perfect... but burn some times!</li>
      <li>The size and shave are excellent.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this shaver after reading another review that said it was wonderfully non-irritating.</li>
      <li>This is a very good value / shaver.  </li>
      <li>Great price.    </li>
      <li>Happy with it</li>
      <li>Great as a spare.</li>
      <li>so this thing comes very handy.</li>
      <li>The Remington R-91 Dual Head Rotary Rechargeable Travel Shaver is very perfect, and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but it serves a good purpose.  </li>
      <li>Much good has been said here about this shaver.   </li>
      <li>Great to be able to use without having the unit pluged into the wall.  </li>
      <li>Very stylish design.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Obviously it was not the best of the class, in fact the first time I used it, my chin was itchy for a day or two.</li>
      <li>Takes a bit longer than the 3-head rotary razors, but nice and compact for travel.  </li>
      <li>I bought this more than a year ago and still in good condition.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, great price for a good product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m talking about with very light shaving</li>
      <li>I love this one..</li>
      <li>but I feel it did better than the 3 head.</li>
      <li>/&gt;very satisfied</li>
      <li>love the feel, the design, the weight and everything; however, it will quit (bind up?)</li>
      <li>I love this thing</li>
      <li>The charge lasted for many shaves</li>
      <li>Two heads are better than one, but three heads are overkill.</li>
      <li>Why don&#x27;t they make USB chargable shavers :)</li>
      <li>I like it better than my Norelco.  </li>
      <li>I love the size and the rotary heads do a much better job than the ones you find on most women&#x27;s razors.</li>
      <li>Cheap price too!</li>
      <li>Most razors have a lot of pieces that come apart easily.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean (make sure to keep it clean as it makes a difference in the shave). :-)  </li>
      <li>The Remington R-91 is an easy to use rotary shaver that is easy to use when shaping a beard, I prefer 2 heads to 3.  </li>
      <li>Have to clean out more often -</li>
      <li>Smooth action, and cuts great.  </li>
      <li>Great travel shaver - compact, smooth shave, uses two double concentric rotary blades to deliver a better shave than the comparable Norelco shaver that sells for twice the price (I have 2 of the Norelco model) and appears to be well built.  </li>
      <li>I love the size and rotary blades - - but even with a full charge, the blades rotate so anemically that they tend to pull rather than cut.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
      <li>Light and easy to use.</li>
      <li>This is a very impressive little shaver.</li>
      <li>Overall, a great buy for $20 however.</li>
      <li>I had visited the vendor web site to look at detailed specs before I purchased it to make shure</li>
      <li>The battery is surprisingly resilient after a year, it actually has lasted better than a three-headed Norelco shaver I had before.</li>
      <li>Just don&#x27;t clean it with running water - using a brush will be fine.    </li>
      <li>I love it very much.</li>
      <li>It is comfortable to you, does its job smoothly and quickly.</li>
      <li>Even with two heads vs the larger 3 head versions, the shave was very good and fast.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also pretty easy to clean.</li>
      <li>Unless you&#x27;re shaving off a full grown beard, the two heads work just as well as the three.  </li>
      <li>Arrives quickly.</li>
      <li>I give it a quick cleaning after each use, and has been holding up well.</li>
      <li>Overall, very satisfied and one can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
      <li>Holds a charge for a good long time.  </li>
      <li>Or buy a better one if something new is out.    </li>
      <li>This is a great little shaver...</li>
      <li>Great little shaver.  </li>
      <li>This would be better if it was a three head, but it&#x27;s a nice little razor for the price.  </li>
      <li>Also it has a normal size so I can easily fit it in my special carrier when I&#x27;m on vacation.</li>
      <li>It is useful.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t even worth the 26 bucks I paid.</li>
      <li>it fits me just right</li>
      <li>small, powerful great for traveling or home.</li>
      <li>I have a full beard and wanted a &#x27;lightweight&#x27; shaver to define the sides and keep my cheek line straight.</li>
      <li>if you want something that gives the average guy a good shave without the hassle of blades and lather then this is for you....</li>
      <li>Invest a little more and get a better shaver.</li>
      <li>For the only being a 2 headed razor - it really does a nice job.</li>
      <li>I like thus electric shaver very much it is idea for on the go when you don&#x27;t have a lot of time on your hand.</li>
      <li>Shaving head consistently pops off the plastic oscillating shaft, requiring pressure to re-engage the ball-socket joint.</li>
      <li>Glad i bought it; would definitely recommend it.</li>
      <li>We bought it this time for my son, as his &#x27;first weapon&#x27;.</li>
      <li>When receiving this shaver, it was evident that it had been used and repackaged for resale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>IT is the first shaver of mine.</li>
      <li>Smaller and more flexible than a triple header</li>
      <li>Other then that, it is nice and compact.</li>
      <li>Too bad, nice size and very handy.</li>
      <li>This one pops off and the pieces pretty much stay together.</li>
      <li>Small easy convenient if the electric beard knife head, then it would be very if they have .Another AC plug power more convenient</li>
      <li>I have had several Remington razors that I have thought were fine</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice and convenient little shaver.  </li>
      <li>The MANUAL is beyond hilarious in its \\&quot;nanny\\&quot; mentality:  \\&quot;Wait at least 15 minutes after getting up before shaving to ensure your face is free of</li>
      <li>Simple and light.</li>
      <li>when I bought this a year ago, it was much cheaper.</li>
      <li>The Remington R-91 is very convenient and does the job</li>
      <li>Works very well as described.</li>
      <li>Although I didn&#x27;t hear of this brand(only know Phillips), it works very well.</li>
      <li>It is light and small enough to fit easily into my toiletry kit.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for women who shave a little hair above the lip or on chin and is very light-weight for travel.</li>
      <li>charger does NOT switch off automatically when fully charged  Note, the European manual states that the \\&quot;shaver cannot be overcharged\\&quot; - hope this is true also for the US model  </li>
      <li>Would recommend highly.  </li>
      <li>They are so inexpensive (less than a replacement head on most shavers), I don&#x27;t mind buying a new one every four years</li>
      <li>A 16 hour charge gave me about 12 days worth of use (daily usage.)  </li>
      <li>And if you are Grizzly Adams you might have trouble finding an outlet to re-charge your shaver  :)</li>
      <li>but after I used it for a few time it was okay.</li>
      <li>I use it for a while, worth it totally!</li>
      <li>now I do grow a nice beard but its not as thick as some...</li>
      <li>Negatives, however, are that it operates on 110V (no mention of 220V capability despite being touted as the best selling travel shaver in the EU - this could be a major drawback for travel to parts of the world with 220V power supply) and very slow charge (instructions indicate 16 hours (!) required for full charge) and no indicator when charge is complete (green light comes on while charging, still on the next day).  </li>
      <li>this shaver great but when it goes down for a charge it can take about 4 hrs for it to get a full life but its very tough and the shave is very fine to the skin if the charge was 2 hrs or less i would give it 5 stars</li>
      <li>I have ordered well over 5-10 of these razors from Amazon and usually distribute them to family and friends as gifts, so I am very familiar with the details of handling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>ONLY - i.e. cannot be used in half of the world, e.g. Europe, China, Australia, most of Africa + South America  *  </li>
      <li>However, the motor is very weak and does not give a good shave at all.</li>
      <li>(maybe the green light can turn off when it&#x27;s fully charged?)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A bit weak.  Pass on this and get three heads.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through a lot of electric shavers (have a slavic beard); and in the last 15 years I&#x27;ve taken to shaving in the car during long commutes. This one holds a charge for several days, runs (relatively) quietly, and for the sake of my wife -- does not cover the dashboard with razor dust. They are so inexpensive (less than a replacement head on most shavers), I don&#x27;t mind buying a new one every four years or so when the blades aren&#x27;t acting as sharp. We bought it this time for my son, as his &#x27;first weapon&#x27;.</li>
    <li> missing power cord, no help offered or tendered</li>
    <li> Unless you&#x27;re Grizzly Adams this should do you well. Fast shipping, great price for a good product. And if you are Grizzly Adams you might have trouble finding an outlet to re-charge your shaver  :)</li>
    <li> The shape is perfect... but burn some times! No is for senssitive skin&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver to shave my legs because I can use neither epilator nor razor. It is comfortable to you, does its job smoothly and quickly. Simply to use and doesn&#x27;t hurt or damage skin. Also it has a normal size so I can easily fit it in my special carrier when I&#x27;m on vacation.</li>
    <li> I purchased this one month ago to replace a similar panasonic shaver that was 10+ years old and at the end of its battery life.  My travel needs are both domestic in the USA and international.  This is a very good value / shaver.  The size and shave are excellent.  Even with two heads vs the larger 3 head versions, the shave was very good and fast.  The charge lasted for many shaves week)and I never actually ran the battery down.  My only suprise was to see the shaver LABLE only support USA voltages of 120vAC. I had visited the vendor web site to look at detailed specs before I purchased it to make shure it was dual voltage including 220vAC 50Hz for international use.  The vendor web site says it does support 220vAC, but the lable on the razor only lists 120vAC.  I did not try to plug it into 220vAC on my trip so I&#x27;m unsure if it would have worked or been destroyed.</li>
    <li> A little rough on the shave but it serves a good purpose.  Great to be able to use without having the unit pluged into the wall.  Small and compact.</li>
    <li> I am sorry the feedback is a little late. It is useful. IT is the first shaver of mine.I love it very much.</li>
    <li> 2nd order of this product.  Light and easy to use. Smaller and more flexible than a triple header ** **</li>
    <li> Works well for its size.  Takes a bit longer than the 3-head rotary razors, but nice and compact for travel.  Stays charged for a couple of weeks when used daily, but of course YMMV.</li>
    <li> Simple and light. Works well. Great as a spare. Runs about 30min between charges. Great price.    Downside: since it&#x27;s a \\&quot;travel\\&quot; shaver, there is no trimmer. Has charger on LED, but no \\&quot;end of charge\\&quot; signal, and takes about 16 hours to charge.</li>
    <li> I like thus electric shaver very much it is idea for on the go when you don&#x27;t have a lot of time on your hand.</li>
    <li> Much good has been said here about this shaver.   It is \\&quot;ok\\&quot;, but  *  quite rough on my skin - rotary screen edges not well machined (de-burred)  *  125V ONLY - i.e. cannot be used in half of the world, e.g. Europe, China, Australia, most of Africa + South America  *  The \\&quot;on/ off\\&quot; button cannot be locked, i.e. the shaver can turn itself \\&quot;on\\&quot; in your travel bag and be completely empty on arrival  *  no travel pouch   *  VERY long charge time (16 hours from empty)  *  charger does NOT switch off automatically when fully charged  Note, the European manual states that the \\&quot;shaver cannot be overcharged\\&quot; - hope this is true also for the US model  The European model is for 220V/ 240Volts ONLY - i.e. cannot be used in Canada and the US   *  difficult to clean (tiny parts, takes skill + patience to take apart, parts could get lost)  Note, I soak the complete shaver head in soapy water (the manual does not allow for that)  ____________  The MANUAL is beyond hilarious in its \\&quot;nanny\\&quot; mentality:  \\&quot;Wait at least 15 minutes after getting up before shaving to ensure your face is free of puffiness\\&quot;  \\&quot;An appliance should never be left unattended when it is plugged in (except for charging)\\&quot;  \\&quot;Shavers are for use on facial hair only.. not for OTHER parts of your body\\&quot; (e.g. your head, ladies&#x27; legs, intimate)  Final straw, RECYCLING of the NiMH battery:  Eight steps steps before you can remove the battery and recycle it.   &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; E.g. Step no. 7: \\&quot;Pull out the circuit board. Cut the the connection plate on both ends  of the battery.\\&quot; Note, their sensible suggestion \\&quot;if local laws allow, recycle the whole shaver\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver after reading another review that said it was wonderfully non-irritating. I&#x27;m afraid I had the opposite experience. It was highly irritating to my skin. I have been unable to use any rotary razor for this reason and this one followed the pattern. If you also have trouble with rotaries, don&#x27;t plan on this one being different.</li>
    <li> This is a great little shaver...small, powerful great for traveling or home.</li>
    <li> When receiving this shaver, it was evident that it had been used and repackaged for resale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I removed the item from the box, I noticed that the plastic container in which it was shipped had markings all over, as if it was simply re-glued together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I opened the item, I noticed that it had various scratches on the surface and it did not arrive with the plastic cover that is usually above the razors.  I have ordered well over 5-10 of these razors from Amazon and usually distribute them to family and friends as gifts, so I am very familiar with the details of handling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part of all was that upon inspecting the inner blades, by removing the shaver&#x27;s top cover, I found remnants of actual hair inside.  That was ABSOLUTELY disgusting.  Shame on the manufacturer and Amazon for doing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISGUSTED!</li>
    <li> Been using it for 3 months now, it really surprised me how close an electric shave is to a razor&#x27;s, never touching those expensive blades ever again. Cheap price too!</li>
    <li> The Remington R-91 is very convenient and does the job well. Easy to clean (make sure to keep it clean as it makes a difference in the shave). :-)  The only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 is that it never lets one know when it is fully charged (maybe the green light can turn off when it&#x27;s fully charged?) Overall, very satisfied and one can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I love the size and rotary blades - - but even with a full charge, the blades rotate so anemically that they tend to pull rather than cut. The result is that you have to VERY slowly go over the stubble, VERY slowly go over it again, and again. I rated it 2 stars because it sort of works, sort of. But I&#x27;m not going to use it, it&#x27;s a dumper or a donation. Too bad, nice size and very handy. Maybe for women&#x27;s finer/smaller hair?</li>
    <li> This is the third one I purchased this year. They are poorly made. You get what you pay for I suppose.</li>
    <li> Great little shaver.  Smooth action, and cuts great.  I like it better than my Norelco.  I give it a quick cleaning after each use, and has been holding up well.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about the rechargeable battery and the cutting effectiveness, but am getting over a month of use with one charge and it cuts well.  Have used non-rotary type before and find that this cuts loose hair growing near the adam&#x27;s apple as they come up so that i do not have to use a trimmer.  Would recommend highly.  Perhaps heavy beard growth person may not get as much use time in-between charges.  Four stars for not having any remaining charge indicator.</li>
    <li> this was exactly what i was looking for- a small compact travel shaver. It does seem to loose speed after about 4 shaves but then i just re-charge. I would recommend this product for someone looking for a travel shaver.</li>
    <li> Pros:  I have no problems at all with this razor. It causes no irritation. It actually gets a closer shave than my Norelco 8240! Some people say it takes longer to shave with it because it&#x27;s smaller, but that&#x27;s wrong. Unless you&#x27;re shaving off a full grown beard, the two heads work just as well as the three.  I&#x27;ve owned this product for a couple weeks now so I cannot attest to its battery livelihood. However, I do know that when it is not charged it will not work even when plugged in to the wall. Furthermore, the charge time is at least 5 hours to get a single shave out of it. A 16 hour charge gave me about 12 days worth of use (daily usage.)  It&#x27;s also pretty easy to clean. Most razors have a lot of pieces that come apart easily. This one pops off and the pieces pretty much stay together. Just don&#x27;t clean it with running water - using a brush will be fine.    Cons:  The manual indicates that the batteries have the \\&quot;memory\\&quot; malfunction - so you MUST use this charger until it is almost COMPLETELY drained before charging it again. This will increase battery longevity. When the battery permanently dies (manual says this should happen after about 4 years of regular use) the razor must be thrown away. So you are buying an item that will last 4 years. After that, buy another. Or buy a better one if something new is out.    I love this thing and I&#x27;m considering using only it instead of keeping my Norelco at home. I&#x27;m in the Navy and travel a lot so this thing comes very handy. I just wish it came with a travel case or something... seems like a \\&quot;travel\\&quot; item should come with one.</li>
    <li> Poor shave. Irritates skin. A toy/novelty item. Waste of money.  Used it a few time, it&#x27;s now in discard pile.</li>
    <li> Works very well as described.</li>
    <li> Great travel shaver - compact, smooth shave, uses two double concentric rotary blades to deliver a better shave than the comparable Norelco shaver that sells for twice the price (I have 2 of the Norelco model) and appears to be well built.  By comparison with the Norelco, the Remington delivers smoother shave, has a lower price, and uses rechargeable batteries.  Negatives, however, are that it operates on 110V (no mention of 220V capability despite being touted as the best selling travel shaver in the EU - this could be a major drawback for travel to parts of the world with 220V power supply) and very slow charge (instructions indicate 16 hours (!) required for full charge) and no indicator when charge is complete (green light comes on while charging, still on the next day).  Overall, a great buy for $20 however.</li>
    <li> For the only being a 2 headed razor - it really does a nice job. Have to clean out more often - but I feel it did better than the 3 head.</li>
    <li> This would be better if it was a three head, but it&#x27;s a nice little razor for the price.  Holds a charge for a good long time.  Happy with it and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> The Remington R-91 Dual Head Rotary Rechargeable Travel Shaver is very perfect, and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I have used the Remington R-91 Dual Head Rotary Rechargeable Travel Shaver for three weeks.</li>
    <li> I bought this more than a year ago and still in good condition. I use it everyday and clean it after 2-3 shaves. I charge it once a week however, when I bought this a year ago, it was much cheaper.</li>
    <li> what I wanted was a simple rechargeable shaver, inexpensive, no bells or whistles and that&#x27;s what I got&lt;br /&gt;very satisfied</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a travel shaver - does the trick and priced well.  Purchased this one after a home robbery and it&#x27;s fine.  No idea how long it will last but at the cost I can purchase several.</li>
    <li> Small easy convenient if the electric beard knife head, then it would be very if they have .Another AC plug power more convenient</li>
    <li> I have a couple of electric razors, and bought this travel one because it&#x27;s rechargeable. Charging works well. However, the motor is very weak and does not give a good shave at all. By the way I bought this product on this same listing from amazon for 25.98, the fact that they&#x27;re charging 60+ dollars for it right now is pretty ridiculous. It wasn&#x27;t even worth the 26 bucks I paid.</li>
    <li> Right now, it is hard to find a Dual Head Shaver in the market. Although I didn&#x27;t hear of this brand(only know Phillips), it works very well. I use it for a while, worth it totally!</li>
    <li> Though I know this was designed to handle a man&#x27;s beard, I was looking for a small electric razor so thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I love the size and the rotary heads do a much better job than the ones you find on most women&#x27;s razors.</li>
    <li> I have dad mine for several years and use it when traveling. It is light and small enough to fit easily into my toiletry kit. Does a very good job of cutting heavy stubble even after several days. The battery holds a charge well and I have only had to charge mine infrequently.</li>
    <li> Easily the worst product I have ever purchased!  I have had several Remington razors that I have thought were fine - this is certainly not one of them.  If memory serves I have had this razor for probably a little over a year.  I bought it because I forgot my razor on a trip to Scotland.  My brother-in-law had a 2 head rechargeable rotary, obviously not this one, which I loved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picture leaving your rechargeable razor plugged in and only using it for 5-10 minutes and after not a very long period of time it simply stops.  You have to take the head off, try to manually turn the posts to get it going again, and then you are hopeful it will keep working until you are done.  I&#x27;m talking about with very light shaving pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the feel, the design, the weight and everything; however, it will quit (bind up?) long before you are done!</li>
    <li> This is a very impressive little shaver. I bought it because it looks neat and to save some space in my travel kit.  However, I don&#x27;t hesitate to use it at home. It  shaves almost as well as the larger triple heads and the battery charge lasts several days. One small nit to pick: It doesn&#x27;t have a snap-on cover to protect the heads in travel.  All considered tho, I would buy this razor again.</li>
    <li> Two heads are better than one, but three heads are overkill. Yeah, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;d write if I was in charge of advertising this baby. It takes a little longer to do the shave, but I mainly use it at home as a follow-up to a blade on my neck, where it&#x27;s hard to get rid of the stubble. The battery is surprisingly resilient after a year, it actually has lasted better than a three-headed Norelco shaver I had before.</li>
    <li> Got this to replace an old Norelco two-head travel shaver. It holds a charge a long time and gives a closer shave even than my old one.  It&#x27;s good for women who shave a little hair above the lip or on chin and is very light-weight for travel. Glad i bought it; would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> It stumbles a bit on my coarse beard and pulls if I mow too fast, but it is a lightweight travel shaver.</li>
    <li> Compre este producto porque queria una afeitadora portatil, hasta el momento ha funcionado muy bien. Eso si es util con la barba muy corta. Si esta muy larga es mas dificil el trabajo. Es util para salir de un aprieto o para llevar de viaje.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for to touch up around my goatee. It&#x27;s quiet, the heads are small (so much better for small spots unlike the clunky 3-head shavers) and I like the press/on press/off button. I also like that it works with or without cord. Mine came with a protective cap but no case. It doesn&#x27;t shave that close but doesn&#x27;t nick the skin around my mouth either! No problems so far. Very stylish design.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice and convenient little shaver.  But if you have curly beard and are prone to razor bumps, this device will tear your face apart.  For all others, do not use this shaver if you have anything more than a small stubble, it will tug real hard at your beard and irritate your face.  Nothing beats a razor blade.</li>
    <li> Need a razor for ten shaves and don&#x27;t want to spend money? This is for you. I wanted a razor that would last a couple of months at least, this razor is not for me.</li>
    <li> The Remington R-91 is an easy to use rotary shaver that is easy to use when shaping a beard, I prefer 2 heads to 3.  I use it at home &amp; when I travel.</li>
    <li> Shaving head consistently pops off the plastic oscillating shaft, requiring pressure to re-engage the ball-socket joint.</li>
    <li> i hate shaving.... also hate those three head razors... I love this one.. it fits me just right... if you have a real heavy beard it may not be for you... now I do grow a nice beard but its not as thick as some... if you want something that gives the average guy a good shave without the hassle of blades and lather then this is for you....</li>
    <li> Works only in 120V - does not travel well overseas where 240v is required.  OK in the US and the region but worthless to take where I really need it.</li>
    <li> The big big minus on this razor is that it is 110V only. While in hotels outside the US, you frequently find 110V outlets, there is no guarantee that you will. Other then that, it is nice and compact. Why don&#x27;t they make USB chargable shavers :)</li>
    <li> this shaver great but when it goes down for a charge it can take about 4 hrs for it to get a full life but its very tough and the shave is very fine to the skin if the charge was 2 hrs or less i would give it 5 stars</li>
    <li> I have a full beard and wanted a &#x27;lightweight&#x27; shaver to define the sides and keep my cheek line straight. While I have a heavy beard, I still expected more from this shaver than I got. Even going over an area several times isn&#x27;t sufficient to give a well-defined line across my cheeks. Invest a little more and get a better shaver.</li>
    <li> Arrives quickly. It&#x27;s very small but does a decent job. I carried it for a 3 day trip without the cords and it did its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously it was not the best of the class, in fact the first time I used it, my chin was itchy for a day or two. I am not sure why, but after I used it for a few time it was okay. I would recommend to use some after shave at least the 1st several time using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Priced right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added benefit - the cable fits the older Braun corded shaver I used to carry with me, but I lost the cord in the hotel; order a new cord will cost $10 which is not worth it; but now I have two shavers since this is a rechargable one.</li>
