<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used it for about two months and absolutely loved it.  I dropped it on my tile floor in my bathroom and it broke. Not impressed with how it is made.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed in the angle difficulties with using the shaver. The color is great, the shaving guide is fully adjustable &amp; is better than my previous one; it had too many parts to keep track of. It is also nicely compact.</li>
    <li> Got it for the missus. Works very smoothly; she recommends highly. Likes the different heads/attachments.</li>
    <li> Works well!  I needed one with better quality and this is the one that fits my needs best.  Would recommend!</li>
    <li> I cut my friends hair and I used this product for the first time yesterday.  It seems to work well and cleaned up his very nicely.</li>
    <li> It was a good product while in use, but....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned this product for less than a year, and it has been used at most 4 times, and when putting it on the charger last night, it would not charge. After removing the grip to check out what happened to the battery, it turned out that gel from inside the battery had been oozing everywhere! I can&#x27;t even return this product or get it replaced as I am on the other side of the world now. How frustrating.</li>
    <li> wonderful,  great for eyebrows,or all other facial hair,  intimate areas, works like a dream, holds charge for a long time.  great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> works as expected. easy to use.</li>
    <li> Very good Trimmer. Very happy with my purchase. I will purchase again, if this ever broke. GREAT Price for this trimmer.</li>
    <li> From a strictly shaving/clipping/trimming perspective, it&#x27;s as expected from a name like Wahl: Solid cutting device.  No pulling or catching.  The versatility is nice, too, as I was going to replace one of those cheap $10 eyebrow trimmers, but decided to go with this instead -- 10 times the functionality (with heads, guards, etc) for twice the price.      However...  When applying, removing, or adjusting the five-level trimmer guard, the trimming head pops off, despite all efforts to hold it on.  TAKE CARE to remove the head, then adjust.  A pain, I know, but the \\&quot;thread\\&quot; that holds the head on is very shallow, and I can see it failing VERY quickly if you keep popping it off.  It is, however, very solidly in place during trimming and shaving, so that&#x27;s nice (and I&#x27;m going to keep it that way by not abusing that thread).  Maybe the guide will loosen up with some further use.      Also, it&#x27;s sooooo not a big deal, but the packaging is slightly inaccurate.  While it&#x27;s not on the package picture, the packaging and instruction booklet say it comes with a comb.  Mine didn&#x27;t -- Don&#x27;t cry if yours doesn&#x27;t.  (don&#x27;t tell anyone, but I wouldn&#x27;t have used it anyway)    It also comes with a little tray...  Useless as ___ on a bull.  I would have much preferred a cheap little drawstring pouch for all the bits and bobs, but what can you do?      All in all, not a bad little item.</li>
    <li> Not a very good product in my opinion.  Does not hold a charge very long.</li>
    <li> Super product. Love the one adjustable blade.</li>
    <li> I use this product mostly for keeping the lady parts neat.  The comments telling that the attachments screw on were helpful, because the first thing I did was twist off the trimmer attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The single guard is nice, with varying lengths, though I&#x27;ve found if I go too fast it pulls the hairs.  Comes with a stand, but that&#x27;s not really a necessary item in my ideals, I just need to plug it in and go, then it lives in a drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well, seems sturdy, just can&#x27;t go very quickly when trimming.</li>
    <li> After looking a several bikini trimmers, I ultimately bought this because i was looking for something versatile. There are not a lot of affordable options that can do everything. I previously owned a Remington wpg-250 Trim and Shape 7-in-1 Precision Womans Rechargeable Grooming Kit.The Remington trimmer was farly cheeply made and after a couple years it got to the point where it would not hold a charge long enough to use it, however, I like how it worked. In comparison this trimmer seems better quality but it does have some plastic attactments that, if broken, would render this trimmer useless. I wanted something that would do trimming and shaving. I am not a fan of shaving with traditional razors in that area cause it always causes redness and ingrown hairs. I would prefer something that cut the hair right above the skin to avoid all that. I was excited/hopeful about the round foil attachment with this. I thought if it worked good it would probably be really handy. It fell short of my expectations. It just was not as close as i would have like, as close as the Remington trimmer did. Plus it takes some extra time to get the right angle or whatever to get all the hair. In terms of a trimmer, this is good. The bare trimmer without the comb attachment is good. It did not knick or anything but i am overly careful in that area anyway. With the comb attachment its simple and effective. It wasn&#x27;t one of those ones where you have to hold it at a certain angle or you can cut the hair too short. I thought it worked very good at trimming. And the small face trimmer also worked good. I use it under my brows to get rid of all the small fuzzy hair that makes your eyeshadow look kind of funny. So, yeah...i wish there were more/better options for doing everything.</li>
    <li> Junk! I have owned a lot of Wahl&#x27;s clippers, most are of high Quality. These are junk!</li>
    <li> The trimmer and shaver are sharp but they get the job done, besides the minor mirco cuts and scrapes the set is awesome.</li>
    <li> The package was very difficult to open and when I dropped an attachment, it broke into 4 pieces.  Also very small clippping head.</li>
    <li> I used this product one time. It would not turn on after that. Money wasted because it was too late to return it when I decided to use it:(</li>
    <li> I love this I had it for a year now, an it still works great. It&#x27;s much better than the one I purchased in the store for more money.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of this product.  The Wahl brand is a favorite in our house and this lives up to the name.  For the price it seems to be of excellent quality and works as advertised.  I have used a different brand (Remington) for the same price that was advertised as a wet/dry product, but that product died after using it in the shower a few times.  I decided to go for this product even though it&#x27;s not wet/dry and it has been great so far.  It&#x27;s easy to use (took a couple of tries to figure out how to firmly attach the comb) and fits well in your hand.  I have used this several times so far on the same charge, so the battery life appears to be excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I have found is the rotating blade attachment does take a few passes to catch all of the hair, so for some people I imagine this could be irritating to the skin.  I don&#x27;t usually have this problem, but my skin was a little more sensitive to this than the other attachments.</li>
    <li> I like the product but wish it had an attachment to fit in the nose</li>
    <li> The product (trimmer and detailer attachments) works well for my hair which is somewhat coarse.  The shaver attachment isn&#x27;t very functional for my hair type but may be more relevant to finer, softer hair types.  The outer package lists a comb as included but I didn&#x27;t receive a comb nor does the main photo show a comb.  There is however a slot in the storage stand for the comb.</li>
    <li> the attachments are twist off rather than snap off. they twist and then snap in at the end of the twist (1/4 turn). the lady groomer or whatever they call it works wonders on every body part. it really cuts close without clipping skin which is important in all cases. not a big fan of the circular clipper that is claimed to be for bikini lines. this is for both male and female use, clippers aren&#x27;t gender specific. overall a very nice product and i would advise this to anyone looking for a body groomer.</li>
    <li> SUPER!! This little razor is easy and convenient. it fits comfortably in the palm of your hand, for accurate shaving.</li>
    <li> Works great. Lasts long enough to get the job done +. Recommend to those who might think about buying this product.</li>
    <li> Just not as close a shave as the Remington.</li>
    <li> works great, but cut me! be careful</li>
    <li> After only a few uses, the battery died and will not recharge. I consider it a defective item, but nfortunately after the Amazon return limit.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay charged very long and doesn&#x27;t work on a lot of body hair.</li>
    <li> Could not ask for more. I had some confusion with the large gaurd attachment never really seem to stay on a certain level or even on the clippers for that matter. Otherwise I a happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This shaver/trimmer works well and best of all - doesn&#x27;t snag or nick!!!  It&#x27;s great for, ahem, the more sensitive areas...</li>
    <li> I purchased this a little over a month ago. Was using it to replace a Conair unit I had for about 5 years, which I loved. This unit is a bit more chunky than my old unit. When using the trimmer, it cuts the bikini area OK, not as great as I thought based on the reviews I had read. However, the trimmer attachment stopped working the third time I used it. All other attachment heads would work except that one. Wahl Customer Service could not explain what happened, but did offer to replace the head right away. So, mediocre product, but great CS service. For the price, I guess you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 12/27/2013- After receiving the replacement head from customer service, I attempted to give this product another shot. Unfortunately, the replacement didn&#x27;t resolve the problem either. The shaver doesn&#x27;t function properly and trims even worse. For the price, I didn&#x27;t expect a premium performer, but it should function, at the very least. This is by far the worse shaver/trimmer I have ever purchased.</li>
    <li> Almost wish I had heeded the advice of the negative reviews. Definitely not the right tool for the intended job.&lt;br /&gt;Comb attachment not adjustable enough.</li>
    <li> Overall a good product but the smaller trimmer is not good for eye brows or delicate facial parts!</li>
    <li> This shaver is great! The special smoothing attachment works wonders.</li>
    <li> I has somewhat  happy and a lot disappointed with this purchase.It was missing a couple of pieces, I did not come with a comb or the larger trimmer head clip on and the the rotating head does not work at all, the trimmer worked great, which is what I wanted most from this package. Luckily it came with the pieces I wanted, except the large clip on trimmer head. . I would have bought another trimmer if I had known I would it would be missing pieces. And that the rotating head would not work.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t charge at all, even after being on the charger all night. Doesn&#x27;t work like you would expect a Wahl product to work.</li>
    <li> This is the worst product that I have purchased online from Amazon. I saw many better quality model than this at walmart store and were at the same or lower price. I looks good in the picture but reality is something else. My opinion is to buy from Walmart rather than amazon online.    Thanks!  Kashif</li>
    <li> it was here before I expected, one day or so? it was great! it and it works very well! just as a clipper should be working!</li>
    <li> was very disappointed normally Wahl is a really good product however this one was not  wish I would have chosen a different one</li>
    <li> we have had this product for a long time and it works well. Money problem we have had is that the charge doesn&#x27;t hold as long anymore but no broken parts or issues.</li>
    <li> This product did not work as well as I had expected a Wahl to work.  I bought it as my cheap $15 trimmer had stopped working after 2 years. However, this one has done the exact same thing after only 2 uses.  My husband put some  oil on the head of the trimmer and it started again, but it is just hit and miss if it will work. Very disappointing for the price.</li>
    <li> This broke the first time I used it.  Buyers, always make sure an item works before the return period expires ...</li>
    <li> I like it. I do wish it had a bag to keep all the parts in.  Not using the plastic storage case it came with.  Haven&#x27;t run out of power after using it a few times!  :)</li>
    <li> Great buy for the price! The trimmer is wonderful, easy to maneuver in small spaces, does not pull hair, and does a nice clean job.&lt;br /&gt;Best I ever had! Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> I use it the trim down below &amp; it gets pretty close, especially with the attachments. And it doesn&#x27;t nick or grab anything like some trimmers I&#x27;ve tried. I would definitely recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for something that will get close without causing any discomfort.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it will do and doesn&#x27;t take up too much space on my counter, so for the price it was worth it.</li>
    <li> Positives:&lt;br /&gt;1) The Detailer head is great.  It cuts the hair very close and does not nick or grab the skin.&lt;br /&gt;2) The rechargeable capability works very well.  It keeps the unit running at full speed.  Other battery powered ones slow down dramatically after just one or two uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;1) Be very careful using the Trimmer head without the Adjustable Guide.  If you trim in the direction of hair growth without the Adjustable Guide it leaves about 0.1&amp;#34; of hair.  If you trim in the opposite direction of hair growth without the Adjustable Guide it grabs your skin and cuts you.  You will end up bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;2) The rotary shaver head is useless.  It doesn&#x27;t work very well at all, because you have to keep going over the same area six times before it shaves clean the 0.1&amp;#34; of hair left after using the Trimmer.</li>
    <li> The unit stays charged for a long time and the blades don&#x27;t pull.  Works very well. You can&#x27;t really charge it while still on the stand, but since it stays charged for so long it really isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
    <li> I love the color of it it works awsome and I love that it comes with a bunch of different shave things</li>
    <li> Perfect size of personal grooming. Small and powerful, easy to use. Holds charge and quiet. I would suggest a plastic lid to keep all the little parts together. The stand is fine but when it got bumped everything went flying.</li>
    <li> It keeps stopping. Me and my friend bought the same one from Amazon.  They keep cutting themselves off.  They last about 20 seconds when you first turn it on.  Then it turns off as it fills with hair.  Even after you clean it, it keeps stopping.</li>
    <li> The blades work well so far.  Its small size makes it easy to move around.  The different attachments are quite versatile.  Just so you know I called the company and confirmed that you cannot use this products wet at all.  I am taking one star off for the \\&quot;cheapish\\&quot; plastic make of the outer shell of the main body as well as attachments but I guess its OK for the price.</li>
    <li> The round head is perfect for fine facial hair it removes it better than anything else I have ever used! I have tried waxing and cream hair removals and they are painful, this removes the hair without any pain.</li>
    <li> This product works but it rusted very quickly even though it is not kept in the shower. It was also missing the tiny comb from the package.</li>
    <li> I have used an electric razor before (a cheap one from CVS) but this one is awesome! Its a lot more powerful and I dont have to go as slow. Its not overly powerful and I&#x27;ve never cut myself but it does take a few times to get used to. My advice would be just make sure you watch what you are doing like using any razor. The different attatchements are great too! I used mine so far from bikini area and have no complaints. Very easy to travel with too</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually a guy who bought this to trim some of the hair that miraculously appears in odd places once you hit your 40&#x27;s :-(&lt;br /&gt;It does work OK, but lacks a dedicated nose and ear hair trimmer. The eyebrow comb was also just a little long for my tastes (I keep &#x27;em short). I&#x27;m not going to trash this, cause it&#x27;s OK, but it wasn&#x27;t quite what I wanted, and I ended up buying a different trimmer.</li>
    <li> Whal is a wonderful shaver does the job</li>
    <li> My shaver was never used in water or dropped. It only worked one time! BUYER BEWARE! I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works well for delicate areas and also was handy for trimming up an &#x27;oops&#x27; area on hubby&#x27;s home haircut.</li>
    <li> Will buy again works amazingly</li>
    <li> Great product, especially for the price!!! Plus it&#x27;s my favorite color! &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> When you are looking to the product, the image show that is supose to come with a bag, suprise there is no bag in the package.</li>
    <li> The other extension don&#x27;t go on base only base I can use so disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Glue was inway it was suppose to go</li>
    <li> Love having my own shaver and not using my husband&#x27;s bulky one.  The smaller head is great for bikini area.</li>
    <li> Loved it....will order again if needed</li>
    <li> I love this product you do not go up and down it goes around and your legs are smooth and the attachments work like a dream</li>
    <li> Everything about Wahl products is great! They are made very well and last a long time. A great value too!</li>
    <li> The product is very cheap and does not stay together. The heads pop off easily making it difficult to get a good shave.</li>
    <li> Even when fully charged, doesn&#x27;t run very fast and doesn&#x27;t work as well as a regular battery-powered shaver.</li>
    <li> This trimmer kit is wonderful. It has a detailer which is really great for those \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; areas and will not cut! Or hasnt yet. The shaver works great too, overall a great buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer mainly for the bikini area, but also a little facial trimming. For the face, it works well since the hairs are light and thin. But it does very little for the thick, coarse hair in the bikini area. The circular attachment doesn&#x27;t do anything really, no matter how I apply pressure or move the trimmer while that attachment is on. The precision trimmer is the best attachment and works the most to do what it should, but still can&#x27;t handle coarser hair.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut well, hair gets stuck and it tugs. No Virginia, I don&#x27;t have thick hair. I just don&#x27;t like having it pulled... always.</li>
    <li> In comparison to my horrible Panasonic shaver, this set is absolutely fantastic.  The clipper attachment has a massive metal head, for crying out loud!  Anything that has that sort of workmanship is worth the purchase price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These continue to charge, hold a charge and perform for me.  Very happy with these!</li>
    <li> This razor set was worth about 5 bucks. The only head that really worked was the smallest trimmer that you&#x27;d use for like, eyebrows or something. Tried to use the length attachment on the main razor head and the hair just went right under the blade. The rotating head also did not work,. Tried it on different areas, different legths, and nothing would make it work. Greatly dissappointed and sad I wasted my money when I was looking forward to it so much.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it much yet, but just in trying to figure out the parts, I can say the plastic trimmer guard is extremely difficult to remove and to set the length.  Each time I want to move it, it is so difficult I am afraid I will break it.  Otherwise, it looks like a pretty good product.  I like how easy it is to switch between the trimming and shaving attachments.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed ! It was working just one time :(</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold much of a charge, very small and all but the trimmer heads are almost useless (probably due to size more than anything).</li>
    <li> When using with the guard, it snags at my hair, almost always.  I had a cheap one before this and it worked much better.  But it was so old I couldn&#x27;t find the same one I had.  I chose Wahl because of it&#x27;s name in quality and I&#x27;m a little disappointed.  But I don&#x27;t need it all the time and ultimately it gets the job done.  I just need to be extra careful...</li>
    <li> It really  has no use. It&#x27;s loud. It ripped the hair from my armpit rather than shaving it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several trimmers (I think by Remington) and this is quite frankly the worst one. I have had it maybe 2 months and the blades are rusted and the part on the inside keeps sticking so the blades don&#x27;t move as fast as they should causing a painful hair-pulling. My Remington ones never rusted, ever, so I was very surprised by this. Also I have to jostle the inside part (the white plastic inside that the motor runs against) everytime I want to use it. The first time it stuck I thought it was actually broken or had a dead battery because I didn&#x27;t realize I&#x27;d have to be jostling parts to make the thing work. I&#x27;m really not impressed and am already shopping for a new trimmer.</li>
    <li> Battery dies too fast.</li>
    <li> This died in less than six months.  Its Very cheaply made, look elsewhere for something better and save your money.</li>
    <li> cute setup but a very powerful trimmer for as little as it is. With free shipping the price really cant be beat</li>
    <li> For what it&#x27;s worth it gets the job done, I think the little shenanigans it comes with are kind of useless. The rotary shaver does NOT work for me at all. In general the trimmer does it&#x27;s job, aside from being a bit cheap feeling and plasticky. It&#x27;s overall a good trimmer for your bikini and other areas</li>
    <li> I choose this rating because the comb was actually not included with the other items, outside of this I would have given this product 5 stars. I recommend this item to females as a necessity. I like this product because it is easy to handle, I don&#x27;t think I have to worry about it breaking down on me, I like the stand it comes with and I like the color.</li>
    <li> Tired of using my husband&#x27;s razor, I went searching for one.  This appeared to be the best value for what is included. I have not used any attachments other than the electric shaver.  Very gentle, yet effective.  I&#x27;ve used it three times since I received it and have not needed to charge it.  Nice stand too.</li>
    <li> Good for those sensitive, small places that a razor is just too big for.  I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Really like this has lasted a long time</li>
    <li> I only use the main trimming attachment to this and it works great.  The power and speed is quick, I can use it with or without it being plugged in.  The shaver attachment is useless, so I wouldn&#x27;t buy this if you intend to shave with it.  I don&#x27;t use the other accessories much but they&#x27;re decent - works but not as great as the main trimmer.  The trimmer cuts so close that it almost looks like I&#x27;ve shaved the area!</li>
    <li> This was so much better than the battery operated ones that use AA or AAA batteries. The power difference is significant, and the rotary tool is amazing.</li>
    <li> Cheap and horrible.  Sticking to remington.  It was rusted after one use.  I dropped an attachment and it instantly shattered.  Pretty bad.</li>
    <li> After charging for the whole day (the unit gets VERY VERY HOT) it barely has even oomph to trim. I charged some more and still not much power. I wish I would have saved the packaging so I could return it. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Eh, it&#x27;s fine. Nothing special, but a good price. It&#x27;s not exactly precision work, but good to have.   Update: Dude, it&#x27;s $18 and gets the job done. What more do you want/expect? I bought one in Aug. 2015 and just used it the other day, still going strong. It&#x27;s not fancy, but it is pretty reliable.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Seems like a great product that will do it all.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done. Small. Compact. Feminine. Although I hate that it often needs charging. Like I would think while not in use it would hold up. That part is rather annoying.</li>
    <li> Does everything I need it for nicely!  Stays charged between charges.  Handy to take anywhere. Easy to keep clean!  This is the 2nd one I have purchased.</li>
    <li> I love it ......no pulling, no pinching,it is quiet you don&#x27;t even feel you are shaving.....It is worth  buying I am going to order a second one..IT IS INDEED DELICATE....</li>
    <li> Works great...has many attachments and uses.</li>
    <li> Love this trimmer!! Haven&#x27;t had any issues with it!</li>
    <li> Worked great...for the two times I used it.  After two uses, it just died.  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> This product is the best thing I have ever bought in my life. It&#x27;s so very useful and compact, I totally recommend this!</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I&#x27;m half German. Yeah. This little puppy has the power and attachments for every part that needs attention. There&#x27;s no pulling or pain. I trim my face with the round and small tip attachments. LOVE the round attachment! I use the big trimmer for... other areas and I haven&#x27;t gotten a rash or ingrown hairs and have used it several times. This little machine is a follicularly abundant girl&#x27;s best friend!</li>
    <li> product lived up to my expectations completely. The color shape and size were exactly what they showed in the picture and description. I am very happy with my selection.</li>
    <li> arrived as stated... trims okay but sometimes it wont work until I turn it on and off couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;charges in a hour or less depends how low it is</li>
    <li> This is the worst piece of junk I have ever purchased.  After only 2 months, the battery completely died, and I have to send it back.  I have had three shavers in the last year, all junk made in China, but this one was the worst of the worst.  I bought it because their hair cutting sets are great.  The hair cutting kits are made in the USA, and I naively thought the shaver was too.  When I got it, it was made in China, much to my disgust.  I really wish I could find a shaver made in the US.  It was poorly made, the heads fell off, and the battery died after 2 months of use.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This little tool is even smaller than I expected but it is too cool. With the whole thing about an inch wide it is a convenient fit into the palm of your hand. Being so small makes it great for navigating tight curves and close spaces. The only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t work while its plugged in so when the battery runs down you can&#x27;t plug in and shave, you have to charge first. But once charged this things works! And the battery lasts long between charges too.[[ASIN:B001FWXKUE Wahl 9865-100 Delicate Definitions Body Kit with Ladies Rechargeable Trimmer/Shaver/Detailer]]</li>
    <li> This is perfect for trimming, holds a charge forever, even used one clipper on my dog&#x27;s face to trim around her eyes.</li>
    <li> It works good so far.</li>
    <li> Not what it was hyped up to be. The outside guides on the small trimmer attachment scrathes my wifes skin. The foil shaver attachment doesnt cut..period. All the leaves is the main shaver, trimmer which is average.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used once, but I did get a couple small knicks in a very sensitive area. But since I can&#x27;t find anything better, I&#x27;ll keep it.</li>
    <li> This works great.  Great price, water proof, easy to use reliable.  Thanks for a great product all the way around!!</li>
    <li> Great for all personal grooming needs.</li>
    <li> by the other members reviews. Doesnt seem to be an Amazon mistake but rather a WAHL mistake. This is a great device and you definitely get your money&#x27;s worth!</li>
    <li> Product came on time and was packaged nicely &#x3D;)  This is the BEST p*ssy shaver I have every used.  I have been researching the best personal shavers and could never find one.  I had a remington but to be honest it was crappy and broke quickly.  Of course whenever I shave down there I always find a way to cut or irritate my skin a little. - For me it&#x27;s just unavoidable... I put a little ointment on and it heals right up. This trimmer/shaver works great I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Not too expensive and this by far beats all of the little bikini trimmers I&#x27;ve tried. The only thing that I find a nuisance is that it&#x27;s easy to nick yourself with the main attachment so you have to be really careful with the angles. I can get almost as smooth as if I used a straight razor so very impressed overall! Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> You exactly what you pay for. They are loud and they pull. I would not recommend even for the price.</li>
    <li> These clippers do everything I want them to do. There&#x27;s a neat case to keep accessories in, a holder for when it&#x27;s chairing, with a slot for the cord to rest on while the clippers are resting on the holder. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I had bought trimmers before but this one works very good. It has different attachments so getting a smooth shave is no problem. I also has a long charge so the battery doesn&#x27;t need to be recharged in the middle of trimming. I just wish there was a sack or box to store everything in.</li>
    <li> I bought this product mainly for bikini area trimming. First, the pros: the product is a nice size and isn&#x27;t too loud. The pieces snap together easily - changing from trimmer to rotary shaver, etc is simple. The brand seemed good - powerful motor - nice packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It&#x27;s marketed as multi-functional, but the guide isn&#x27;t really adjustable and it&#x27;s way too long for bikini area trimming. I used the trimmer by itself to get a closer cut and ended up nicking myself once or twice - ouch! - there was no way to get an even trim in-between super-long and stubble.&lt;br /&gt;  - The rotary shaver did not work at all&lt;br /&gt;  - the mini trimmer wasn&#x27;t very effective, although I hadn&#x27;t planned on using it on my eyebrows anyway.&lt;br /&gt;  - the stand doesn&#x27;t hold the pieces well&lt;br /&gt;  - the plastic feels cheap - I was afraid the pieces would snap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I returned this and instead went for a men&#x27;s beard trimmer - also from Wahl - because they seemed to have a better selection of trim guides and the changeable trimmer/shaver/detailer options. Also, it&#x27;s about the same size and weight. I am very happy with my new Wahl trimmer, even if it&#x27;s marketed for men. I would recommend the brand - seems reliable, just not this product in particular.</li>
    <li> So far I love it. A lot a pieCes. I&#x27;m sure there for something just haven&#x27;t used then yet. Used product twice for gentle area. No complaints at all</li>
    <li> I did alot of research before I purchased this product because I was so used to my old one until it finally gave out. When I first got it, I thought it was small but once I began using it for my delicate areas, it made complete sense of the size. It is comfortable to hold and turn. I love it.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get this as it was a good price but it stopped working after 1 use. The first time was great as it was quiet and came with many attachments but disappointing. Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> What a disappointment.  It is so loud.  Louder than full-size clippers.  Any hair longer than about 1/4\\&quot; will get caught in the guard for the trimmer, which hurts like crazy!  I had to use the trimmer without the guard, so then I was in danger of getting nicked... and did. The little facial hair attachment worked well, if you don&#x27;t mind the noise of the motor.  The tray is pointless.  Would rather have had a box or bag for storage.  This cheap little thing is proof that you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Comes with a shaver and a really long trimmer guard. Needs to have one in between IMO. Also, it doesn&#x27;t stand up well in the stand.</li>
    <li> This item has a rechargeable battery that began to malfunction early on. I made the mistake of not returning it soon enough. Also, the blade was pulling hair instead of shaving it. If it was sharp when I received it, the sharpness did not last long. So, bad battery, dull blade. I threw it away and won&#x27;t purchase the same item again.</li>
    <li> Too short without guard, too long with guard.  Not enough adjustment.</li>
    <li> This little thing works great. Very sharp, be careful using it without the tools that cover, it can snip the skin.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints. It was missing the comb that it says comes with it, but I don&#x27;t need that so it makes no difference</li>
    <li> Little disappointed.  It does not trim very well.</li>
    <li> el equipo cumple contodas las especificaciones que se establecen en el articulo, muy buen equipo, recomendado a los usuarios de los mismos</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to stick to my Remington! Not happy with the Wahl. It seems to have &amp;#34;too much&amp;#34; power, if that makes sense. It makes me nervous on more delicate body parts, it&#x27;s a little too rough. Also, you have to go over the area multiple, multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this to replace my Remington personal shaver, because I kept having problems charging them. However, they are much nicer on the body, have just the right amount of power, and trims better on the first pass.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t too happy with this one.  The only attachment that worked well was the longer skinner one.</li>
    <li> This was a good price and shipping quickly, but it doesn&#x27;t cut very well.</li>
    <li> Cuts good.. Easy to use.. Heads jiggle in the socket but other than that its great!! I really enjoy the product as a trimmer.</li>
    <li> It works so I have no complaints on that front, but I thought it came with a storage case. There is no storage case.</li>
    <li> Works well at a good price. The adjustment comb is difficult on the first adjustment.. really tight when you first put it on and would not slide. I carefully pried the sides with a thin knife to move it. After that first time, it slides fine now. I&#x27;m satisfied, and I&#x27;d buy another one of these.</li>
    <li> Bought this to shave my legs and remove facial hair,  Kudos on the removal of facial hair, but a definite failure using the rotary shaver on my legs,  It doesn&#x27;t catch the hair at all -totally useless.  I&#x27;ve been a big fan of Wahl&#x27;s for years - even have a Wahl&#x27;s system for grooming my dog.  But this collection of utensils just doesn&#x27;t do as advertised.  What a disappointment and waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer. It didn&#x27;t pull or cause bumps. The only complaints that I have is it didn&#x27;t come with the comb and the close detail attachment doesn&#x27;t really get all that close. I would recommend this for anyone.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about a month and used it a few times and it worked well. The rotary shaving attachment officially does nothing to my hair. I&#x27;m not sure if I received it broken but if so I don&#x27;t mind since I bought this for the precision and comb attachments.</li>
    <li> Its ok. It has a tendency of pulling the hairs if you don&#x27;t have a attachment on it. I do notice is you shave downwards its less pulling, still not the best</li>
    <li> Nice but broke easily. Did not get much use out of it.</li>
    <li> This worked horribly, and a comb was missing from the packaging. The whole thing went right back to Amazon. I think I&#x27;m better off with separate eye brow/ body shavers versus an all-in-one that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001FWXKUE Wahl 9865-100 Delicate Definitions Body Kit with Ladies Rechargeable Trimmer/Shaver/Detailer]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This a great item for trimming body. It is important that you charge it the night before you wanna use it. Despite that fact it trims very nicely and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin do to razor burn. I would so recommend this to a friend because of the great quality and attachments.</li>
    <li> Given for Christmas, it was well received.  a b c d e f g h i j k l m</li>
    <li> I should have stayed with my previous brand Remington.&lt;br /&gt;Not sharp enough, just makes a loud noise.&lt;br /&gt;Not happy, none of the parts work as described.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd one i have bought, 1st one finally had some wear on shaving screen..but lasted over 6-7 years.Love it..Great for all shaving needs,  I use it mostly for facial hair..but great for other areas also.</li>
    <li> I guess I expected more from Wahl...even if i did only pay $20 for it. Really awful quality, snags if you dont hold it at the PERFECT angle. Overall I am dissappointed that this product came from Wahl. Also mine was missing some pieces when I received it.</li>
    <li> One of the attachments broke the first time I used it. It will keep a charge.</li>
    <li> I have used other shavers that were a better shave. This one doesn&#x27;t get as close to the skin without pulling hair.</li>
    <li> No regrets Wahl has always been a great product its replacing an old one i had that broke down...fantastic service</li>
    <li> Ok....not very powerful</li>
    <li> I like the different attachments but some of them are not powerful enough for your bikini line.  Have to be careful with the main trimmer attachment because it will scratch you.  Wish the battery life was a bit longer.</li>
    <li> Thank you, this is a wonderful product. It works really. well. Shaving the back of my neck is a lot easier now.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I have ever owned!  I have purchased many shavers that did not live up to their claims of no nicks, bumps, etc.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Died right after Amazon&#x27;s 30 day return policy expired.  How convenient.</li>
    <li> The attachments are a waste and a bag rather than a tray would be much more useful. The clippers work well though and do just what they should.</li>
    <li> I literally used this once and that was it, it never worked again. I read all the other reviews that said it only lasted for one use and you always think it will be different for you–except it wasn&#x27;t. I called the toll free number listed in other terrible reviews and basically you send it to the company with the power supply (which of course you pay for shipping) and they fix it for free and return it. I don&#x27;t have time for products that last for a few minutes.</li>
    <li> Works well - exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> I figured hey...it&#x27;s Wahl it&#x27;s gotta be great!  Bah!  This thing might be fine for a very young person new to shaving so as to ease your fears of accidental ouchies, but I&#x27;m an old pro at shaving the delicate areas and I need something that doesn&#x27;t lightly (read that: barely) shave the hairs.  Also, if it&#x27;s not at it&#x27;s absolute full charge, it will rip out your hair.  Skip it and go for a mans beard trimmer with some power. My $.02.</li>
    <li> Loved my old one. Unfortunately, so did my exboyfriend who stole it and kept it during the break up. Will be reordering me a new one for myself.</li>
    <li> I love the outcome of getting a wax, but when my budget doesn&#x27;t allow for one - this does the job. Doesn&#x27;t leave razor bumps, cuts close, easy to use, quick and painless. I usually use right before my baths - this makes it easier to eliminate shaved hairs that has fallen.</li>
    <li> The product is nice, but we are disappointed because although the package says it includes a cleaning brush and a Blade Oil, it really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Very good, I use it a lot!!</li>
    <li> Love this multi-use shaver. Great buy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s compact and easily stored. I think the short or close shave piece is useless. The wand attachment and the main shaver parts are much better. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but I did have some snagging of hairs. Very minor ouch. It&#x27;s still a good product and I think it will last a long time as it&#x27;s well made.</li>
    <li> This product. It does exactly what it says it can do. You just have to use the right attachments for the type of shave/trim you want and where you want it.</li>
    <li> Love it, works better than other personal grooming tools that I have tried in the past! Has a fair battery life between charges.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Wahl products, my Dad has been using them for years. They are very reliable as long you read the instructions and learn how to take care of them.</li>
    <li> Already rusty after one use. Trimmer cuts extremely close. Once this bites this dust, I&#x27;ll probably try something else.  Really just average.</li>
    <li> I received my order promptly and just as pictured. I have used my shaver knce or twice and it&#x27;s ok. I believe the motor runs a little uneven. I don&#x27;t need to use it often so i guess i can live with it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used all the pieces yet, just the main head that it came with. I&#x27;ve knocked it out of the holder so many times when it&#x27;s charging that I now just leave it on the counter. It operates fine. I&#x27;ve only had it for about a month and a half, though, so only time will tell how sturdy it is.</li>
    <li> Not strong enough. Doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
    <li> Product wasn&#x27;t effective at all. The razor is not sharp enough, didn&#x27;t shave much. Regret wasting my money on it. Don&#x27;t get it !</li>
    <li> Sorry to say... Works terribly. Battery runs out pretty quickly and doesnt seem to shave well at all. Already bought another one from Ulta... Mens! Seems better quality for sure</li>
    <li> I use this for my bangs and it works great!</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made product for the money!</li>
    <li> Love this trimmer ... !!!&lt;br /&gt;Love the look of it too ! Love the RED :)&lt;br /&gt;The big head works fantasticly, stays put. The little head is EXTREAMLY noisy ... I&#x27;m actually not using it because of that. And the round head, well can&#x27;t figure the way to attach it ...&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend !</li>
    <li> Works very well and hubby can borrow charger for his Wahl :)</li>
    <li> Horrible trimmer! Metal is rusting after less than two months of use. Will not hold a charge. Trims erratically, pulsing faster and slower.</li>
    <li> This trimmer system fits the bill. The trimmer keeps a charge and cuts through without snagging. Make sure you keep the system oiled regularly to prevent the trimmer from locking up between uses.</li>
    <li> not outstanding but works great does what it is suppose to and keeps on chugging</li>
    <li> This razor was great when I got it, but after my third  use it wouldn&#x27;t recharge for the life of it. Very disappointed!!!! Wish I could get a refund.</li>
    <li> I like it alot and it worke that is what i liked. it was sent fast and it was ready to use when i got it.</li>
