      <li>These are great, easy to swallow, and have lots of great stuff in them.</li>
      <li>vitamins are a good size that&#x27;s easy to swallow.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>So honestly it&#x27;s kind of a toss up on which I like better.</li>
      <li>This one has a nice texture and was easy to swallow.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also pleased with the taste/smell of these...</li>

      <li>Fantastic product!  </li>
      <li>I bought this product for my wife and she can feel the healthy difference.</li>
      <li>I have been taking Healthy Mama</li>
      <li>I liked that the packaged included both the bottles and a significant amount of pills for the price.</li>
      <li>These were pretty good.</li>
      <li>I have been really nauseous during my pregnancy and have tried my fair share of vitamin brands to see which ones</li>
      <li>They are also easy to swallow.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are also easy to swallow.</li>
      <li>Instructions were easy as well.</li>
      <li>not what you want when you&#x27;re pregnant and your senses are already heightened!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s dye free and the DHA has no fishy</li>
      <li>Enjoyed it very much .</li>
      <li>so it evens out and is definitely worth it!</li>
      <li>I was excited to try these and</li>
      <li>Ive also used Rainbow light and New Chapter prenatals, New chapter were great, but too exspensive.</li>
      <li>I will definitely buy more of Healthy Mama products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend these to anyone that is pregnant.</li>
      <li>First, these didn&#x27;t make me throw up!</li>
      <li>Originally, I had purchased the more expensive variety because they bragged of causing no stomach issues, which I had previously experienced with the more reasonably priced vitamin varieties.</li>
      <li>easy to swallow, not giant, and no nasty vitamin taste.  </li>
      <li>even more excited I was able to keep these down.</li>
      <li>I recently switched from Costco prenatal vitamins to Healthy Mama brand and right away I noticed that the capsules are not super-sized and easy to swallow...</li>
      <li>Rainbow light is actually cheaper per pill and is food based which I love.</li>
      <li>Over all, a good solid product, though maybe a little more pricey than couponing at the drug store.</li>
      <li>First off, I like that this product was a two month supply which saved having to make a purchase every month.</li>
      <li>I have a pretty sensitive tummy these days, so that&#x27;s really important.</li>
      <li>The pill encompasses everything I need for my prenatal care, and I love how I only have to look to one product for this.</li>
      <li>I love that a DHA supplement is included, rather than having to purchase multiple products.</li>
      <li>This is the first one that does not hurt or upset my stomach.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>No weird taste and didn&#x27;t upset my stomach.  </li>
      <li>The Prenatal Vitamin was normal in size (comparable to the size of a regular Tylenol tablet), and was very easy to swallow.  </li>
      <li>Easy to swallow too, I would definitely recommend.</li>
      <li>Packaging was easy to read and open.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend them!</li>
      <li>Aldo liked that I do not get fishy aftertaste after few mins.</li>
      <li>The pill is pink and has a slippery coating which makes it easy to swallow.</li>
      <li>I have tried swallowing pills and also the chewable prenatal pills while pregnant (this is my second pregnancy).</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend these prenatal vitamins.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I will say though, these pills were not hard to swallow.</li>
      <li>The DHA pills are also gel like and easy to get down.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a little concerned that the box says you should check with your physician first before taking if you&#x27;re pregnant or breast-feeding.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant difference from other Prenatal vitamins, but they haven&#x27;t upset my stomach either.</li>
      <li>I was able to get it down each time, but it was a short battle to do so.  </li>
      <li>Almost every prenatal I&#x27;ve tried does, no matter how far into my pregnancy.</li>
      <li>Each time I took this supplement it nearly gagged me.  </li>
      <li>The only real problem I have is I wish it was Folate instead of folic acid.</li>
      <li>I pills are not too large, and don&#x27;t leave a grimy texture in your mouth like other pills.</li>
      <li>Although a little more costly than the prenatal vitamins I usually buy, with this product you get a 2 month supply</li>
      <li>I prefer the chewable prenatal pills because while pregnant it is just hard for me to swallow such big pills.</li>

    <li> This is a great product! I pills are not too large, and don&#x27;t leave a grimy texture in your mouth like other pills. The pill encompasses everything I need for my prenatal care, and I love how I only have to look to one product for this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled with prenatal a having to take them at night to avoid and upset stomach, with these prenatal vitamins it didn&#x27;t matter when I took them my stomach never got upset. Such a relief! I&#x27;d highly recommend these prenatal vitamins.</li>
    <li> I am currently at the end of my second trimester and just recently started taking these prenatal vitamins and DHA supplements. I liked that the packaged included both the bottles and a significant amount of pills for the price. Packaging was easy to read and open. Instructions were easy as well. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t give this product 5 stars because it just isn&#x27;t something I would purchase again for another pregnancy. I have tried swallowing pills and also the chewable prenatal pills while pregnant (this is my second pregnancy). I prefer the chewable prenatal pills because while pregnant it is just hard for me to swallow such big pills. I will say though, these pills were not hard to swallow. The pill is pink and has a slippery coating which makes it easy to swallow. The DHA pills are also gel like and easy to get down. I didn&#x27;t feel sick after taking these pills for a few days which is a plus because prenatal pills do sometimes make me feel off. I just personally wouldn&#x27;t try this brand again because I like chewable tablets. If you can handle swallowing the pills, go for this brand because the ingredients are awesome.</li>
    <li> I have been really nauseous during my pregnancy and have tried my fair share of vitamin brands to see which ones I can actually keep down which is very few. I was excited to try these and even more excited I was able to keep these down. It&#x27;s also great the have dha so I don&#x27;t have to take a separate pill.</li>
    <li> so happy with this product! easy to swallow, not giant, and no nasty vitamin taste.  I wish it came in a larger quantity, but ill buy these again.</li>
    <li> This is the only multi vitamin I have taken that did not have a after taste!!! I take it every day and I lovd it</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife and she can feel the healthy difference. I will definitely buy more of Healthy Mama products.</li>
    <li> I have been taking Healthy Mama prenatal vitamins for roughly a week now. Before these, I had been taking prescription prenatal vitamins which were extremely expensive and not covered by my insurance. I have to say that I am thoroughly impressed by the Healthy Mama Be Well Rounded Prenatal Vitamin. I can tell no difference whatsoever between them and the much more expensive alternative. Originally, I had purchased the more expensive variety because they bragged of causing no stomach issues, which I had previously experienced with the more reasonably priced vitamin varieties. The Healthy Mama vitamins are both affordable and cause no stomach upset or fishy after taste. They are also easy to swallow. I would highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a little over a week now in my 3rd trimester. I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant difference from other Prenatal vitamins, but they haven&#x27;t upset my stomach either. I have a pretty sensitive tummy these days, so that&#x27;s really important. I take them at night before bed to minimize the tummy issues, but I have definitely not noticed any. And the DHA supplement hasn&#x27;t caused me any reflux issues (or fishy aftertaste) like some others have. Over all, a good solid product, though maybe a little more pricey than couponing at the drug store.</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s dye free and the DHA has no fishy aftertaste.&lt;br /&gt;They are also easy to swallow. but They more expensive than nature brand Prenatal vitamins.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking these for about a week now and have no complaints.  No weird taste and didn&#x27;t upset my stomach.  I do prefer chewable vitamins, but these were still good.  I&#x27;d recommend these to anyone that is pregnant.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t like to take pills, especially the large multi-vitamin. This one has a nice texture and was easy to swallow. For the omega 3 supplement, it&#x27;s a beef Gelatin, which is hard to find. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase! Although a little more costly than the prenatal vitamins I usually buy, with this product you get a 2 month supply so it evens out and is definitely worth it! I also like that the DHA supplement does not give me that gross &amp;#34;fish burp&amp;#34; afterwards. Easy to swallow too, I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!  No need to stress anymore about which vitamins to take.  Healthy Mama took care of that.  Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> First, these didn&#x27;t make me throw up! WIN! Almost every prenatal I&#x27;ve tried does, no matter how far into my pregnancy. These are great, easy to swallow, and have lots of great stuff in them. The only real problem I have is I wish it was Folate instead of folic acid. You can do some research on the differences, and folate is much better. Ive also used Rainbow light and New Chapter prenatals, New chapter were great, but too exspensive. Rainbow light is actually cheaper per pill and is food based which I love. these have DHA. So honestly it&#x27;s kind of a toss up on which I like better. If you are considering these, they work.</li>
    <li> These were pretty good. They weren&#x27;t big horse pill vitamins and they got the job done . You get a lot in the pack two bottles . Enjoyed it very much .</li>
    <li> It has been wonderful!</li>
    <li> I think the vitamins were great.  There was nothing fancy to them but seemed to work well and no complaints just nothing out of the ordinary.</li>
    <li> I gave the vitamins 4 stars only because of the price (they are a bit expensive).  Otherwise they are great and provide all the nutrients I need for my baby.</li>
    <li> A little low on vitamins like calcium, and magnesium. It has EPA and DHA, which I&#x27;m looking for in a vitamin. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the way I feel is because to vitamin I was previously taking. But it doesn&#x27;t make me feel any worse either. I&#x27;m a little concerned that the box says you should check with your physician first before taking if you&#x27;re pregnant or breast-feeding. I&#x27;ve seen other prenatal vitamins that do not say this.</li>
    <li> First off, I like that this product was a two month supply which saved having to make a purchase every month. The Prenatal Vitamin and DHA Supplement were both included (in separate bottles) in this purchase. The Prenatal Vitamin was normal in size (comparable to the size of a regular Tylenol tablet), and was very easy to swallow.  The DHA Supplement was another story for myself.  I thought the pill was good in shape until I tried to swallow it. Each time I took this supplement it nearly gagged me.  I was able to get it down each time, but it was a short battle to do so.  I would purchase again, just have to go to battle each time the DHA Supplement is taken.</li>
    <li> I love that a DHA supplement is included, rather than having to purchase multiple products. I&#x27;m also pleased with the taste/smell of these...some vitamins are just AWFUL...not what you want when you&#x27;re pregnant and your senses are already heightened! Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> All of the prenatal vitamins I have tried have left me nauseous. This is the first one that does not hurt or upset my stomach.&lt;br /&gt;I love how they have the added DHA supplement. It does not give me &amp;#34;fish burps.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Both vitamins are a good size that&#x27;s easy to swallow.&lt;br /&gt;I give this product five stars.</li>
    <li> I recently switched from Costco prenatal vitamins to Healthy Mama brand and right away I noticed that the capsules are not super-sized and easy to swallow... Big plus! The combo pack has 2 bottles one for multivitamin and one for DHA. Aldo liked that I do not get fishy aftertaste after few mins. Will continue with these for rest of my pregnancy.</li>
