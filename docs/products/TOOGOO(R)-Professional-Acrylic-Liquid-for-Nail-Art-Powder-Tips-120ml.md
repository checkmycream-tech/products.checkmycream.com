<li> Smaller than I thought but decent product.</li>
<li> then it looks it come only half foul of the acrylic liquid.</li>
<li> and it was only half full....dissatisfied</li>
<li> Once ordered this before, but for some reason this bottle was smaller than the previous bottle I ordered.</li>
<li> Took along time to ship expected bigger bottle too small</li>
<li> Arrived today half empty...waited forever, it finally arrived and bottle is really small</li>
<li> that&#x27;s half</li>
<li> Acrylic liquid usually comes in small bottles and runs out way before the powder is used up.  </li>
<li> I smelled the product and know it&#x27;s acrylic liquid at least.</li>
<li> We i got it and is very small like trial size.</li>
<li> false advertising, an oversized bottle and a longggggggg......</li>
<li> but unfortunately, the smell of it is so very horrible.</li>

    <li> Thought it would be waaaaaaaaaay bigger. And It&#x27;s only HALF FULL!!!!!! never going to buy this again get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Really like this liquid! Great deal for the amount!</li>
    <li> Great price for what you think your going to get.&lt;br /&gt;But what actually comes in the mall ( a month later ) is a 120 ml bottle that&#x27;s half full.&lt;br /&gt;So in reality you&#x27;re  paying a great price for 60 ml.&lt;br /&gt;If false advertising, an oversized bottle and a longggggggg......shipping time bothers you,don&#x27;t purchase</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought but decent product.</li>
    <li> Not only does is it smaller then it looks it come only half foul of the acrylic liquid.</li>
    <li> This has mma and should STOP selling to the US</li>
    <li> So, it got here sooner but my issue was the product labeling. My bottle says Acrylic Remover but another photo on here shows Acrylic Liquid. For the payment, it should have the proper labeling. I smelled the product and know it&#x27;s acrylic liquid at least. I shouldn&#x27;t have to though since acrylic liquid isn&#x27;t supposed to be directly inhaled.</li>
    <li> it does the job but unfortunately, the smell of it is so very horrible. One needs to be outside in the open air to use it or the fumes might kill ya.</li>
    <li> This is great acrylic liquid. Once ordered this before, but for some reason this bottle was smaller than the previous bottle I ordered. Same seller, same description, same price??? Disappointed in that aspect, otherwise great product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I was expecting to see a bigger bottle, so i bought some until this arrived. We i got it and is very small like trial size.</li>
    <li> Much smaller than anticipated. Good price. Works well with the acrylic powder.</li>
    <li> Took along time to ship expected bigger bottle too small</li>
    <li> Acrylic liquid usually comes in small bottles and runs out way before the powder is used up.  Nice to have a larger amount like this</li>
    <li> Good product. Just wish the bottle was bigger</li>
    <li> I thought it would be bigger</li>
    <li> Great product. Shipped fast too! I got it before the estimated delivery date :) Exactly what the product says. Thank you!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a 2 inch tall bottle paid five bucks for that waste of money and very upset</li>
    <li> I LOVE this acrylic liquid.  I&#x27;ve never used anything else &amp; probably won&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle. Since I started doing my own nails at home.</li>
    <li> Arrived today half empty...waited forever, it finally arrived and bottle is really small and it was only half full....dissatisfied</li>
    <li> thought it was alot bigger</li>
