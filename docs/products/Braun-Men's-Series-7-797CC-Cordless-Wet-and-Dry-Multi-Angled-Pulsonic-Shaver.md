      <li>Product arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t do a good job on the neck and the  chin shaving</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Like most men I meet, I hate to shave, and have suffered from ingrown hairs seemingly forever. I&#x27;ve tried every kind of shave gel, foam, cream, and razor around. I even tried a Norelco razor, but this shaver is the best, and is actually pretty life-changing. I don&#x27;t have to dread shaving every day. Right out of the box, this shaver communicated quality. Braun products have always seemed well-constructed to me, and you can feel the heft in this machine. The shave-even the first time-was incredibly smooth. As smooth or smoother than a blade. I&#x27;m always afraid to shave against the grain with a blade, so this was actually closer. Also, and perhaps most importantly, this razor doesn&#x27;t pinch. My problem with my old Norelco (one of the in-shower varieties) was that it always seemed to pinch and nick my face. This shaver is incredibly easy to use right out of the box, and really doesn&#x27;t take any break-in time as far as I can see. I was hesitant about the alcohol reservoir and how much that would cost, but when you figure in cost of all other shaving supplies, you&#x27;ll probably spend less over time. The upfront cost may be steep, but if you really want to enjoy a shave, you have to get this razor.</li>
    <li> I have used the Braun shaver for years so naturally when I needed a new one I chose another Braun.  I am very happy with my new shaver.</li>
    <li> I recommend the Braun 720s shaver as a non-immersible but rinsable electric shaver.    Amazon didn&#x27;t list the 720, however it looks very similar to the 760, so I thought I&#x27;ll share.    Pros: Cost effective and efficient. Like the fact that you can always use it on the cord, should the battery be flat or failed. Shaving results are very acceptable for my usage.    Cons: Not waterproof, but can be rinsed under the tap.    Details: I was tossing up between the Panasonic and the Braun. Both are excellent and the decision was made for me by the fact that I was in a shop that didn&#x27;t sell the Panasonic. The Braun offered a 60 day try or return deal so I bought it. I think that for value for money the rinsing/charging bases are a rip off. You can get just as good results by using the tap! It not only saves $$ but bench space too. I&#x27;ve had a Panasonic for the last 10 years and was happy with it, however I always had to finish off with a blade as it left stragglers behind. The Braun is much better.    I am always puzzled when people compare electric to blade shaving. It is physically impossible for electric shavers to equal a blade. simply because the blade glides directly on the skin, so can cut the hair at practically zero length. In contrast, all electric shavers work like horizontal scissors: the outer foil rests on the skin and then the cutter slides across the aperture where the hair is sticking into the shaver, to cut it off. Thus the best possible shave is cutting the hair at the foil&#x27;s thickness. Q.E.D. But who cares? I don&#x27;t! As long as it is quick, convenient and acceptable.    Back to Braun versus Panasonic: I think both will produce top results from their top models. Difference is that the Braun can&#x27;t be used in the shower or bath, but it can run straight off the wall socket (corded) if necessary. Stick to models that are made in Germany/Japan, respectively, rather than in China. Buy the base cleaner/charger if cost is not important, or without to save $$. For the alcohol based cleaners, you can replenish evaporated alcohol from surgical alcohol from your local chemist.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my Dad. He owned and used a previous model for almost 13 years! He loves hisnew razor and remarked on how close he shave is. He is very happy with the product. Would definitly recommend it. Worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Product performed as advertised.  Price better than competitors for same item.  This was my first purchase from Amazon.....service and delivery were great.</li>
    <li> Just as reviewed by others, this shaver is great so far.  I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months, don&#x27;t shave every day and love it when I do.  One thing I really like is that it gets those soft flat hairs at the bottom of my neck. Overall shave is very good.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  I had always wanted to get a braun because i heard that they&#x27;re the best, and finally went through with the purchase.  Love it so far.</li>
    <li> This shaver is just what i thaught it would be this is my forth braun shaver and this is the best yet alittle priceee $ but probibly worth it .I love it.have to give it a 10 i dout ther is any thing better out there.</li>
    <li> I formerly bought the cheapest Braun shavers. The shave was OK. I was not disturbed when I replaced the entire razor rather than buying a new head for almost half the price of a new razor. 22 months ago, I decided to try a good razor for a premium price. The shaves were great and the recharging/cleaning stand worked well. I shaved, cleaned, and charged every day. After 16 months, I noticed the grey paint in the back of the razor was peeling off. Since then I have cleaned the stand each time I replaced the fluid cartridge to insure flakes were not clogging anything. Now at 22 months, the razor has difficulty making contact with the recharging buttons in the stand. I tried looking for areas which could cause an alignment problem. I also did not notice residue on the razor or stand contacts. The only thing I discovered is that if I wiggle it around in the base the unit eventually makes contact. However part of the automatic cleaning process is to run the razor, this causes contact to be lost. The directions for the razor indicate it should not be removed while cleaning. I have no idea if the razor has been damaged. My current solution is to secure the razor to the stand with a rubber band.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a 10-yr-old Braun Syncro 7526 which was starting to show its age.    Initial Impressions--Feels great in the hand.  Shape fits well, and weight is great.  VERY LOUD.  Pulled a few beard/mustache hairs out and didn&#x27;t seem to cut as closely, but pamphlets said that this may be the case for the first 4-6 weeks.  Charges quickly.  Clean cycle seems a bit stretched out timewise, but otherwise does well.    After 2 months of use--No improvement in shave closeness.  Still losing a few hairs every day (painfully).  Find myself even pulling out the old 7526 to do some of the edges around the beard.  5 o&#x27;clock shadow now coming by 2pm.  By 5 o&#x27;clock, looks like I have 2 days of growth already.    Bottom line--Fairly disappointed, especially considering what they&#x27;re charging for these now.</li>
    <li> Just bought the Braun 760 model and am very disappointed. It is not one bit better than my 6 year old $60. Norelco. It may be the closest thing to a razor but still not even close.</li>
    <li> Since I think it&#x27;s important to know when you&#x27;re reading a shaver review, let me start by saying I have a dark, fairly thick, fast-growing beard.  I shave each day with a razor and then follow it up with an electric shaver.  That said, I&#x27;m very impressed with this shaver.  I don&#x27;t know if the pulsonic action improves the shave but it definitely improves the comfort level.  I let my father borrow mine and he liked it so much for shaving his bald head he bought one himself.  It does provide a close shave, although I think it&#x27;s slightly less close than a razor (particularly the neck area).  If you have a lighter beard or hair color you will probably find it as good as a razor.  The cleaning base works very well; I use it 1-2 times a week and after 3 months it still shows \\&quot;high\\&quot; fluid levels.  The travel case is a nice included feature.    Bottom line: if you want a comfortable self-cleaning shaver, give this one a try.</li>
    <li> Update - March 2010:  I have been using the Braun now for over 4 months and still love the shaver.  I also was pleasantly surprised when the first cleaning cartridge lasted over 3 months before I decided it was time to replace it.  In reality, the indicator still had not even hit the &#x27;replace me now&#x27; lighted position - I just decided to put a new unit in.  So for those reviews that claim that the cleaning is expensive and the cartridges do not last long, that clearly has not been my experience.  It works well and, for me, it lasts! *********    For reference, I have been using electrics for 20+ years, including a couple Brauns and a couple Panasonics.  Most recently I was using a Panasonic 8077 Vortex (since replaced by the nano/Arc series) so this is a bit of a comparison between the Braun 7-series and the Panasonic.  First, though, I am not someone who used the wet-shave capability of the Panasonic even though that is one of its strengths, so consider this a comparison between the two only if you expect to shave &#x27;dry&#x27;.  (I liked the wet shave capability of the Pana, but it seemed to introduce more clean up and storage issues than were worth it to me.)  So here are my thoughts after coming back to Braun after ~5 years of the Panasonic:    &gt; Shaving Smoothness:  Hands down, the Braun is better for me.  The Braun glides over my skin smoothly and comfortably and never gets warm, even without using any pre-shave or lubricant.  The Panasonic had more friction and generated significantly more heat (again, not using the wet shave functionality).  I changed the Panasonic blades and foils at least every year if not more often and the difference with a new foil was readily apparent. But a month later I could tell that it was dragging again and getting warm sooner.  I have used the Braun now for more than a month and it feels the same now as when I first turned it on.    &gt; Closeness:  A tie.  Both do a decent job while neither are &#x27;as good as a blade&#x27; no matter what anyone says!  For my skin and beard, both can do a very acceptable job with the Panasonic perhaps being a bit faster with a new foil and blade, but that only lasts a month or so and then they are similar.      &gt; Cleaning System:  For me, the Braun is much better.  Both are somewhat noisy, so no advantage either way on this front.  But the Braun simply leaves the shaver feeling and smelling cleaner and a visual inspection &#x27;under the hood&#x27; seems to confirm that the Braun does a better job.  The Panasonic system, which is water based, has the problem that you must remember to check the water tank and insure that it is filled or it will run out of water and not tell you.  This happened a number of times over the years.  The Braun, on the other hand, uses a self-contained fluid cartridge and the system will let you know whether it needs replacing.  I have seen some Panasonic fans comment about the alcohol solution of the Braun as evaporating (I have not experience this as the system seems to be sealed once the cartridge is in place and it only pulls in fluid as it needs it)and a possible fire hazard (What?  Don&#x27;t smoke while you&#x27;re shaving!).  I&#x27;ll run the risk of slight evaporation and the even more remote possibility of the cartridge somehow catching fire for the superior cleaning of the Braun system!    &gt; Quality:  Both are undoubtedly well built, but the Braun simply has a higher quality, less plasticky feel than the Panasonic.  I never had any quality issues with the Panasonic shaver (I did have the cleaning station die an unnatural death) but the Braun simply feels better in the hand.  And the supplied accessories, particularly the protective travel cover vs. Panasonic&#x27;s non-protective bag, also seem better thought out and higher in quality.    &gt; Head:  Just an aside, but I did check out the latest Panasonic Arc model but the head was so large I felt I was trying to shave with a toaster!  The Braun head, like my prior Panasonic, is a comfortable and manageable size to do the job.      Finally, I bought the Braun 7-series instead of the new 5-series because a) I got it for only $10 more and b) the Braun 560 LEDs look like the Christmas Tree Lites at a drag race!  Okay, so that is just a style issue, but I figured it was better to spend the extra $10 than wrap duct tape around the 560!      In summary, as the title says, it is nice to have a Braun again!</li>
    <li> Pruchases this item for my husband two years ago; purchsed it for my son this year. It is by far the best electric shaver. The refils are a pest but the close shave is great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m back to a Braun after wasting money on a cheaaper Remington rotary... Read the reviews for this and they are prettty much on the money.  I get a decent shave and the razor is easy to handle.   The thing that drives me crazy is the stupid cheap plastic \\&quot;coffin\\&quot; that they expect you to use as a travel case with not even storage for the cord... reduce the \\&quot;throw away\\&quot; nonsense packaging and give us a nice carrying case....</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin when it comes to shavers and this one doesn&#x27;t irritate my face at all. It really does give THE closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric and I&#x27;ve had one from norelco and two from panasonic, rivals disposable blades. The cleaning station is awesome too, I love not having to take any time to rinse out my shaver. For me, this shaver is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great razor.  Gives a close, comfortable shave.  Easy to use and the self cleaning is terrific.</li>
    <li> I call it my space station. It sits there booping and beeping and buzzing and flashing lights. If it were sitting outdoors at night, we might get reports of UFO sightings! Oh, the review? OK, here goes:  1. Good, close shave every time.  2. Great for the lazy guy (like me) &#x27;cuz you never have to clean it!  3. If you&#x27;re on a tight budget, buy a shaver for about $75 that you have to (oh my!) clean manually.</li>
    <li> I have bought in the past 3 Braun shavers and 2 Panasonic shavers. I went through 2 of the Brauns before buying the Panasonics. The reason I bought the Panasonics was the ability to shave in the shower. The Panasonic were OK in the shower, but not like a razor in that I had no where to put it while I showered. So I rarely used the Panasonic in the shower. The first Panasonic did a good job, but I didn&#x27;t like the trimmer. When the second Panasonic came out, a sonic or something, it was worse than the first. It would take forever to shave my neck. So I bought a Braun 8595. At the time it was top of the line. And it gave a good shave and was easy to maintain. After more than 3 years, the shaver needed a new cutter block and screen, and I thought it was time to buy another. I was seriously thinking of buying another 8595, but instead went for the 760. I am glad I did. It shaves fast, close and is even easier to maintain than the 8595. It makes short work of my neck area and has a great trimmer. The best shaver yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Braun 7526 for the past 7-8 years. It was satisfactory. My new Braun 9585 is far superior. The shave I get is much closer. Usually, I finish my shave with a wet Gillette razor to get the nubs. I can eliminate this step sometimes, depending on the day.  I do not clean my 9585 daily. In my opinion, it is not necessary.</li>
    <li> Bought this razor based on the reviews - it worked ok for a year, but then died (won&#x27;t charge or run off cord).  After doing a search, this has happened to others - no easy way to repair.  Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> The Braun Series 7 with pulsonic head is described in reviews as being a great break through in electric shavers.  It does not shave as close as my old Remington shaver.  On the positive side, the battery holds up very well and the trimmer works well.  Unfortunately, I would have to say it is not worth the $200+ I paid for it.</li>
    <li> I like my Braun 7 series, i have it for 6 month now.  It does close shave, almost as close as razor, however you need to use after shave, because it warms quickly and leaves red spots all over the face. I would not pay 200 dollars for it, but could not get any cheaper.  Bottom line, if you need electrical shaver, this is the best one on the market in US, the other one which i use in Europe is Formula 1 series made by Philips.  MUCH MUCH MUCH better, but only uses 220 volts outlets, therefore i use that one when go to Europe.</li>
    <li> A little expensive, but I love the shave. Have used Panasonic for previous 6 years. No comparison. Also like the fresh smell after each cleaning. Am on my first refill of cleaner, still indicating \\&quot;full\\&quot; after 4 weeks(I run the cleaning cycle every other day).</li>
    <li> I owned a Bruan shaver before.  This new generation is much better.  It shaves closer then the old one..........</li>
    <li> I have used Braun shavers for years and this one gives me the best shave yet. Very close shave and easy to handle.</li>
    <li> I have been wet shaving since I started shaving ten years ago, and I&#x27;ve never used an electric shaver before. I&#x27;ve never really liked shaving because of the skin irritation, the occasional cuts, and being honest here, because I&#x27;m lazy. So based on the online reviews, I splurged and got the Braun Series 7. Although it only cuts 90% as close as wet, it is definitely \\&quot;good enough\\&quot;, and I&#x27;m never going back.    One caveat here: I do have a light beard, and from what I have read, there is no perfect shaver because every man&#x27;s face is different. But, the shaver comes with a 60 day money back guarantee from Braun, which is why I was willing to try it. Luckily for me, I&#x27;m very happy with it.    Also note that the 790cc model has an additional LED that indicates hygiene level, a fast clean button on the base, and black trim. I didn&#x27;t think any of these features were worth paying extra for, so I got the 760cc.     Good:  + Zero skin irritation, never cuts me, never pulls my skin  + I can shave in just a minute or two if I&#x27;m in a hurry (I might add another minute to get a little closer, and clean out the foil)  + Doesn&#x27;t have a problem with several days growth  + It&#x27;s comfortable to hold, feels solid, but not too heavy  + Battery lasts about a week, and you can use it with the cord if you forget to charge it  + Trimmer is useful for sideburns, eyebrows, etc. (although slightly awkward to use. I remove the foil when I use the trimmer)  + The truly lazy could shave while watching TV, in the car, etc.    Bad:  - Expensive! I effectively paid $144.99 for the shaver due to a giftcard promotion, and even that is a lot for a shaver. I&#x27;m not sure I could justify paying full price.  - Supplies are also expensive. A replacement foil costs about $40 and needs to be replaced every 18 months. The Clean and Renew cartridges are about $6 each, and Braun says to replace them every 30 cleaning cycles or 8 weeks. Luckily, the shaver can also be cleaned under the hot faucet. So to save money, Ionly use the Clean and Renew system once a week, and I remove from the base and reseal the cartridge to prevent evaporation when not in use. Users claim this method can make the cartridges last 6 months or more. It is annoying that Braun can&#x27;t seal the cartridges while in the base, but I&#x27;m sure it helps them sell more cartridges.  - Not quite as close as a wet shave. I think this is because wet shaving removes a layer of your skin that the electric razors don&#x27;t. But I haven&#x27;t had any complaints from my girlfriend, and the end result looks exactly the same as a wet shave. A shave still lasts a full day, so this is a very minor complaint for me.  - I&#x27;ve had to change my morning routine, because you must shave with a dry face. So instead of shaving after a shower, I either shave before, or shave after breakfast.    Overall, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my switch. No more irritation, no more cuts, and it lets me shave quicker too!</li>
    <li> I was looking for an electric razor to shave my head as well as my face.  I prefer to not use a razor on my head everyday.  After checking a number of websites, this Braun continued to be recommended for head shaving.  Ih ave had it now for 3 weeks an love it.  It provides a great close shave on my head, almost as close as a razor.  It works well on the face althought I prefer a razor on my face.</li>
    <li> Have had a number of Brauns and generally liked them.  Bought the top end Pulsonic. Worked well for ~6 months, then just stops working mid-shave (all after regular cleaning cycles, etc.). Have to remove the cutter block, clean it out, press the reset button, and then it&#x27;ll work a little while before dying again.    And, the pop up cutter does not re-seat!  Hangs open at 30-45 degree angle ... forever.    So, bought the non-LCD version of the Pulsonic.  Have had ~8 months and has had the exact same thing happen - popup cutter doesn&#x27;t pop BACK!  And, it has started stopping mid-shave as well.    Each shaver was well over $200 and THIS is what I get for it?!    If someone knows of another shaver with less Marketing / promotion hype and greater reliability, would love to hear about it.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> My old Braun shaver worked great. When the old one burned out after 10 years I decided to upgrade. To my disappointment the new foil design constantly snags my facial hair and has never given me as close of a have as the old model. I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was using a less expensive Braun Electric shaver for the past 4 years, then I read a review about the Braun Series 7-760cc, which lead me to buy one and I am not disappointed.  As stated in the review it will give you the closest shave of any electric shaver.  Even though it is pricey, I don&#x27;t regret buying it--outstanding!</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun for over 25 years, in short this razor is below par of other Brauns of the past. As far as closeness of a shave its ok, For neck hairs you will have to park it there for a while, back and forth. My biggest complaint is when shaving around my goatee, the shaver will pull and pinch goatee hairs, sort of a pain. For the price it should be better than just OK.</li>
    <li> I had used the previous model Braun shaver for about three years and replaced it with this one when it broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Series 7 is very similar in function but provides a closer, faster shave with less irritation.  It is much lighter than the previous generation but the reduction in weight does not SEEM to result in a cheaper feel or lesser construction quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have is that the trimmer pops up at a 90 degree angle to the shaver handle and it is not as easy to use as the previous version.  But, I got used to it quickly and it is not a big deal.  It includes a nice hard case, cleaning tool, and some machine oil in case you don&#x27;t use the included cleaning system.  And, if you have not used a self cleaning shaver before it is great.  Yes, it costs some money for the cleaning cartridges but the shaver is always clean, oiled, dried, and charged each time you use it.  Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is the best shaver I have used and would purchase it again without hesitation.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an electric razor and found this one to be the number one recommendation of Consumers Report.  I checked all websites and found the absolute best value on Amazon.  Purchase was fast and easy.  Delivery time exceptional.  After using this item for several weeks I can say I&#x27;ll never go back to a regular razor.  Shopping this way is the ONLY way to go.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few years now.  For the price when I bought it, I expected more.      One negative about this razor is that it self-cleans, but it leaves colored cleaning fluid on the razer that gets on my skin when I shave in the morning.  So I have to wipe it off each morning before I use it.      Next negative--it cuts OK, but for the advanced technology I&#x27;m supposedly paying for, it doesn&#x27;t cut well enough or close enough, even with the new blades I recently bought.     Next negative--replacement cleaning fluids have to be replaced about once a month, and they aren&#x27;t cheap--around $12 for 2.  Multiply this times the life of the razor, and you get a decent income stream to the manufacturer.     Positive--well, it holds a charge pretty long.  Controls are straightforward.  And it does cut.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not cheap, but it is a terrific shaver.  I&#x27;ve never had such a close shave using an electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base keeps the shaver looking brand new, and I&#x27;m finding the cartridges for the base last for a long time.  (The instruction manual suggests to use the cleaning function ever day and mentions the cartridge will last 30 days; I am cleaning mine every two or three days, which seems more than enough, and my cartridge still is at the \\&quot;high\\&quot; level 30 days later.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that it comes with a protective case for traveling (and the case has a brush built in so you can clean the shaver while on the road away from the cleaning base.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thrilled with the Braun Series 7.</li>
    <li> After using this for six months, I am pleased with this shaver and I would buy it again.  I was surprised that it was necessary to shave for a longer period of time (~1 minute) than I had with previous electric razors. However, the result was superior to any shaver I have used for the past 30 years.  In addition, my skin has become more senstive with age and susceptible to razor burn which I do not get with this product (although I find it does not shave quite as smoothly immediaitely after cleaning).  The cleaning cycle is noisy and I find it unnecessary to clean the shaver as frequently as indicated perhaps because I do not have a heavy beard.  I would recommend this product particularly to those with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Hurts like heck.  Good shave if you can get past all of the pain. Bought a Panasonic Wet/Dry Shaver and now I&#x27;m happy.  I wasted a whole bunch of money on this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 50 years and this is the best I&#x27;ve owned.  I had an earlier model Braun before this one and rated it only 3 stars.  The electric motor in the 760cc is MUCH quieter and oscillates the shaving blades at a much higher frequency than the earlier models.  I have \\&quot;trouble spots\\&quot; for shaving (under the neck, around the ears) and the 760cc does a great job.  Not only is the cleaning automated, but sensors even let you know if a modest, more economical cleaning is called for a a more complete cleaning is necessary. I also have little or no razor burn even when I aggressively shave. Most importantly, my wife notices how much smoother my face feels!</li>
    <li> I am quite happy with my new Braun, Series 7 - 760cc shaver.  The one thing I that I GREATLY dislike is the \\&quot;pop-out long hair trimmer.\\&quot;  It is very difficult and uncomfortable to use. My old Model 8595, which I used daily for over 5 years, was set up perfectly to do what this one misses by a mile!  I do admit that it shaves much closer without extra overpasses.  I do suggest that Braun look at coming up with a different design for a long hair trimmer to operate similar to the Model 8595. I just don&#x27;t like it.  Otherwise it is \\&quot;GREAT!</li>
    <li> I bought this on a recommendation from a friend and went for the higher end model because I wanted the best shave.  I previously had a Norelco shaver for almost 20 years.  No, that&#x27;s not a typo.  Granted I probably should have replaced it a few years earlier because it was no longer holding a charge at all so I always had to use it plugged it, but it worked amazingly well.  I used it that way for probably two years and finally gave in.  I know I didn&#x27;t pay nearly as much for that shaver, and I have to say it was a far better shaver than this one.  This one isn&#x27;t bad at all, but it takes me quite a bit longer to shave.  The end results are great though, much the same as the Norelco, but probably twice the time to shave.  And cleaning this shaver is tough for a good cleaning, except for the automatic cleaner, but that feels more gimmicky to me than it&#x27;s real value.  Every single time I shave it says it needs to be clean, and if I go two shaves without a cleaning it says it needs the maximum cleaning.  This feels like a ploy to get people to buy more cleaning solution.  And I brush the shaver inside and out every time I shave too, so it seem ridiculous that it still needs to be automatically cleaned this often.  For this reason alone I&#x27;m tempted to only give it two stars, but I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a bad shaver, I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price.  If you really want a Braun I&#x27;d probably recommend a lower model without the auto cleaning gimmick.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband over 2 and a half years ago.  This is the first electric shaver he has owned that he actually likes.  It produces a good, close shave and does not leave him with any razor bumps or burn.  Also there is no issue with hair tug/pull when shaving.  He has used it almost every day for going on 3 years and it still works beautifully.  **Update**:  Just came across this review in my account and thought I should throw in an update!  The razor is still going strong at 8 years old.  We did have to replace the base because it developed a leak a couple years back but other than that and just regular care, it still runs like it did when it was new.  It has been used 5-6 days a week, just about every week, for 8 years so I&#x27;d say I got my money&#x27;s worth and would not hesitate to purchase another Braun shaver in the future!</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I have ever used, bar none. It is the easiest to use, easiest to clean, and gives the best shave. It reaches hard-to-reach places on my skin more easily than any other, and cuts more cleanly. The trimmer cuts more neatly than any other I have used, but when it is in use, it is hidden by the body of the shaver, and that is an inconvenience.</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of Braun shavers for many many years when I decided to upgrade to the 760 series.  I found the floating heads do not shave close under my chin and upper lip.  The 760 is very comfortable to use, but lacks the close, clean shave of previous models.  The pop-up trimmer is not nearly as functional as on earlier models.  I have sent the 760 back to Braun for a refund as they offer a 60 day money back guarantee.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moP2Z1XNHF1SCC]]Hello everyone. This is a 9 minute and 37 second clip of my review and opinion on the Braun 760cc electric shaver.    I cover several aspects on ease of use, items it comes with, features I like, and any problems I have with the shaver.    I, at the time of making/publishing this video, am just getting over a cold so have a little bit of sniffles -- for this, my apologies.    I hope this video gives you some insight and useful information, and opinion, on this shaver.</li>
    <li> This razor is the best electric razor I have ever used. The instuctions said to give it time, so your skin could adjust, but it was great since the first shave. I use it for my face and also shave my head daily and I must say it provides a close and comfortable shave. I am very pleased with the razor and would recommend it to anyone who wants a good cordless razor.</li>
    <li> My husband has tried many zazor but keeps telling me over and over how much he loves the Braun Series 7 - 760cc Shaver.  He said it shaves the closest of any electric razor he has ever had.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love my Braun 760.  The closeness of the shave is amazing.  By the time the water would have gotten hot at the sink, I&#x27;ve finished shaving and am on to the next thing, saving both time and energy.  It does take up more counter space than I&#x27;d prefer, but that&#x27;s a small sacrifice for an excellent shave.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver after using Norelco&#x27;s for about 10 years. I decided to switch because the Norelco&#x27;s took a long time to complete the shave, often missed hairs, and snagged too often around my mouth.     On the plus side, this shaver has not once snagged a hair on my face and I have at least average density facial hair. In addition, the shaver is a touch faster than the Norelco, especially because it doesn&#x27;t miss hairs often. These are big wins, but they come at a cost.    A huge negative is that this shaver is very messy. Even after a cleaning, the shaver leaks hair as it cuts all over the place. So I basically have to shave over a sink, which sort of defeats the purpose of a cordless shaver.    Another negative is the noise...this shaver is very loud. I&#x27;ve had to chance my shaving routine so that I don&#x27;t wake up people in the house. Seriously.     Finally, like the Norelco, it&#x27;s not great at shaving my neck and sideburn area. I wish it was better, but at least it&#x27;s not worse. I typically use a blade razor shave those areas now.</li>
    <li> Sure this is a quicker shave than I used to get with my 8500 series shaver that I had to put up with just over a year - 360 complete, forget it. Considering this new 9500 doesn&#x27;t come with a shaverhead protector and the same crappy plastic travel case that comes with the toothbrushes of the same brand that cost less than half the price, well, you can tell that an american company is in charge here. Braun used to be german owned and the travel cases used to be of good quality and stylish. But hey, I&#x27;m just old fashioned and reminiscing the past. This is today, and today we spend almost twice what the previous model cost. The shave is better, but so was that of the 7500 series that I replaced with the mediocre 8500. Sure, others rate this shaver very highly, and so they did the 8500. But I have difficult beard and have been using Brauns for more than 25 years. This is a good shaver, and it looks a lot better than the 7500. Money well spent? I hope it&#x27;ll last for 3 years before the battery starts acting up...</li>
    <li> The Braun Pulsonic does an excellent job of giving me a close, comfortable shave, even with several days growth. I am surprised that the company provided a cheesy plastic travel case for a shaver that cost over $200. Looks like they could provide a higher quality case.</li>
    <li> Switched over to this razor after blades have gotten so expensive! Going from an older electric razor that I used on the weekends to this razor has been incredible! It&#x27;s as close as a blade, and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s peeling your skin off while shaving. I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> I bought a Norelco last time and it lasted a year and gave out. I went back to a regular razor using the Gillette Mach III. My wife did some reseach online and purchased the Braun Pulsonic 9585. This has given me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had which is far superior to the Mach III razor or Norelco. I have a very dark beard and this leaves me smooth as silk and I can go longer between shaves. I&#x27;ve had the Braun since Christmas 2007 and it&#x27;s great. I can go a little over a month before I need a new cleaning cartridge. I&#x27;m glad my wife did the research and it&#x27;s been the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned and I think of her everytime I use it.     Thank you honey. :)</li>
    <li> This razor is really cool and is so simple to use.  It works great and provides a very close shave to ALMOST every part of your face.  There are still some issues with getting on the neck in those hard to reach areas.  You have to be careful or you end up rubbing your neck raw and that looks worse than if you missed a spot.  All in all, a great razor and much easier and faster than a regular razor.  4 out of 5.</li>
    <li> I have been a long time customer of Braun Shavers and when I updated the the 760 I was greatly disappointed with the shave it provides.  I took it to the service center after a week or two and they replaced the head.  The problem was that it was pulling hairs rather than cutting and not giving a close shave.  The new head was better but still does not provide what was advertised and still pulls hair.  My face looks like I have been using a blade razor.  And the worst part is that after all of the pulling it still does not give a good shave.  Really surprised!!!</li>
    <li> I have used many different electric shavers and this one is by far the best. It provides a nice clean shave and the cleaning system is great.</li>
    <li> Honestly this razor rocks.  The battery life is fantastic, the shave is better than good, and the self cleaning keeps the thing in top working condition.  I paid the price because I believe you get what you pay for but I really can&#x27;t say if this is worth the price.  My 10 year old Panasonic actually gave a closer shave and it wasn&#x27;t half the price of this one.  Would be nice if you could try before you buy.</li>
    <li> This is my second braun electric shaver, the first was circa 1980&#x27;s. While my old shaver worked well for my face it couldnt cut most hairs on my neck. i switched to razors about five years ago but decided to try electrics again because I would constantly get ingrown hairs and razor burn even though I would use the best shaving gel and lotion aftershave. I have to shave everyday and would usually shave again if i was going out the same night.  Ive been using this shaver for about a month with good results. Its a little loud but it can shave my neck well. I pay more attention to the direction of hair growth to get the best shave, running my hand over my face to see which areas need another pass. this electric will give you a very smooth shave with no irritation if you take your time and give your facial hair about a month to adjust.</li>
    <li> So far (about a month), I&#x27;m not seeing it meet its advertised claims.  It does a decent job above the chinline, but below the chinline I can&#x27;t seem to get it to do a good job.  It consistently misses even longer whiskers below the chinline.  I previously had used a Norelco \\&quot;lift &amp; cut\\&quot; type electric shaver, which wasn&#x27;t so great either, but it seemed to be more consistent.  I&#x27;m still experimenting with this one to see if I can get it to work better, but I&#x27;m beginning to wonder if it will...</li>
    <li> I tried quite a few electric&#x27;s (from various manufacturers) before, but was always ending up returning them. Braun 7 does absolutely fantastic job - very close shave, no skin irritation. Cleaning system rocks. Travel case could be better for a $185 shaver.</li>
    <li> Having shaven for 55 of my seventy plus years, I have owned practically every electric shaver on the planet. My last one was a Panasonic wet/dry which was the best at the time and I used it for about 8 years and thought seriously about getting another one until I tried a friend&#x27;s Braun Series 7. This shaver has met or exceeded ALL of my expectations. It is a little pricey, but as they say, \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;. Spend the extra money and get the shave of your life and with it&#x27;s daily cleaning process, this shaver will probably last the remainder of mine.</li>
    <li> i have been using this shaver since early january 2010 and i want to say it does a good job on my face, but it seems to have a hard time removing the hairs from my neck.  i am older, so maybe the looseness of my skin under my neck causes this issue. for the price, i would have expected better results, but i will continue to put the shaver through its paces to see if it gets any better.  if not, i&#x27;ll give it to my 15 year old grandson and go back to my 30 year old norelco rotary shaver with the original blades.</li>
    <li> I have always used electric and once or twice a year shave with a razor.  I read articles on the net about the Pulsonic and thought I would take the plunge.  I picked this one over the more expensive model because I don&#x27;t need an LCD screen or quick cleaning honestly I don&#x27;t see the need. Cost wasn&#x27;t a factor why pay more for something that is unnecessary.  The shaver itself is  Fantastic.  The Norelco maybe because of the lift and cut system irritated my skin something I didn&#x27;t realize may have been the reason until I used the Pulsonic.  I have been shaving for 25 years and this is my 3rd electric the previous electrics were both Norelcos. I would highly recommend the Pulsonic.</li>
    <li> I tried it right out of the box, and got the best  and most comfortable shave ever. And I had been using a Braun 360! A little pricey, but worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I previously had the Braun Syncropro and thought this would be better because of the positive reviews and supposed technological advances.  I was very wrong in that assumption.  This razor does not cut nearly as close, even when repeatedly going over the same area.  Also, it occasionally pulls the hairs on my neck.  I am returning it for another cheaper, and far superior, Syncropro.  Don&#x27;t become tricked by Braun&#x27;s marketing!</li>
    <li> I have used their 2 previous models and I have to say this new system is as close to perfection in an electric shaver as you can get . . . I have extremely sensitive skin and I am thin so I have a very scrawny neck, shaving with standard blades and shaving cream leaves my face bright red and irritated and usually with a cut or two but even I can get a really close smooth shave the old fashioned way . . . I hate shaving and only do it every other day . . . a few years ago I decided to sacrifice a really close shave for the convenience of faster easier shaving with an electric . . . the 2 Brauns I have used up to now caused less skin irritation but I always had to shave the \\&quot;trouble areas\\&quot; on my neck over and over from different directions but both Brauns still did not catch some stubble here and there . . . this new Pulsonic System is so much better, it is more powerful and efficient, the longer lasting battery does not get weak while I am trying to get all hairs in my \\&quot;trouble areas\\&quot; as with previous models . . . I get very little skin irritation now because shaving takes much less time thanks to the Pulsonic catching almost every single hard-to-get hair after just 2 or 3 passes . . . also, it is much more comfortable to hold and so much better looking than previous ones, even the cleaning-recharging station is much better looking now . . . it is true that the new travel case is not as nice as previous ones but that&#x27;s no big deal . . . and they no longer include a clear plastic snap-on protector for the shaver head ( that most users probably lose or discard anyway ) but anyone paying this much for any high quality product should be smart enough to be careful with it and not drop it, etc . . . so the bottom line : if you have never even considered paying this much for a shaver I can honestly say this is the first and only one I am aware of that is actually worth the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had to face it (sorry, no pun intended): my whiskers are just weird. I don&#x27;t know about anyone else&#x27;s, but my grow in patches in different directions and different diameters which means that no matter what razor type I use, some hairs get missed or won&#x27;t fit in the screen/rotary. Blade shaving is like driving on a bumpy road in a car filled with broken glass - I&#x27;m a bloody wreck at the end. So, every few years I try a new razor in the hopes that someone will make one for someone like me who doesn&#x27;t have a \\&quot;standard\\&quot; male beard (whatever that is). My wait appears to be over, and this appears to be the product that has solved all my hair problems combined.    I don&#x27;t know if it is the \\&quot;pulsing\\&quot; technology or the screen layout/middle cutters that allows it to get hairs growing in different directions AND the really thick hairs I have in some places in my beard, but this razor does the job and, better yet, I do not get ANY nicks or cuts. I&#x27;ve found that for me, shaving like it&#x27;s \\&quot;off to the races\\&quot; or with hard pressure does not produce good results. I need to go slow, against the direction of the hair growth (which means just going in every direction in my case on my neck), and gentle pressure gets all of my problem areas. I&#x27;ve also found that using a pre-shave product (I use Eltron Shave Stick) to prep my whiskers and skin really helps the razor do the job.    Clean-up is a snap as has been mentioned. Wives, girlfriends or house-mates will appreciate having a shaving system that doesn&#x27;t leave whiskers or shaving cream residue all over the sink area. It is hygenic, automatic, and (for me) worth the price and the wait. Your mileage may vary, but if you have never found a razor that gets all of your problem hair areas, I would suggest that this may be the final solution if used according to the instructions, with good shaving products, and your own particular needs.</li>
    <li> After two months the product still doesn&#x27;t work well on my neck; it leaves fairly substantial stubble.  Overall this product gives a less close shave than my razor.  I wanted a more environmentally green product than my disposable razor and shaving cream, but this isn&#x27;t it.  Lots more waste in the form of disposable packaging for the cleaning solution.  The unit uses one of these a month and Braun doesn&#x27;t have a refill kit for the solution.  For $230 I expect to be smoother than a baby&#x27;s rear end.</li>
    <li> This is my second braun razor (last was the 8585 which was fine but gave out after three years of daily use). The new 9585 is quieter and faster... the shaver head is much better engineered than the 8585. However, the shave is about the same.. very good for an electric but not as good as a blade. It is much less irritating for me than a blade. As for those who think it doesn&#x27;t shave necks and chins well... follow the directions-- give it a month or so and give yourself a month to really get the right moves. As for the automatic liquid cleaner-- it is a little noisy but one hell of a lot easier than cleaning the thing by hand.  YES-- it cost a lot of money... over $200 which is kind of crazy but I like Braun so I paid the price. What is this thing really worth in parts and labor? Who knows.</li>
    <li> Well I have had this razor for about a week and it is by far the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  I decided to get the 760cc because really who the hell needs an LCD screen on their razor? If you charge it and clean it close to every day then the screen really doesn&#x27;t mean crap anyway.  I will never purchase another type of electric razor again. It&#x27;s very smooth, precise and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. I&#x27;ve tried razors that pivot, rotary razors and even razors that shoot lotion at you but nothing comes close to this thing.  I wound up purchasing mine at BJ&#x27;s wholesale store because for $180 dollars you get everything that would come in the box normally plus 2 extra cleaning cartridges, can&#x27;t beat that. If you can gather up a wad of cash to get this razor what are you waiting for.</li>
    <li> Did not cause irritation but did not shave neck very well.  Way overpriced.     Expensive parts.</li>
    <li> The Braun Pulsonic is comfortable to use. Don&#x27;t expect a closer shave than less expensive models from Braun and other manufacturers. I was hoping for a lot more from the Pulsonic razor. That said now that I own it I will use it until an electric razor comes out that can actually give us a close and comfortable shave like a blade can. If that day comes the Pulsonic will become a paperweight, a rather expensive one at that.</li>
    <li> I bought the Pulsar 2 months ago hoping for a better shave than what I was currently getting from my Norelco 8825XL Spectra with newer blades. I had some hairs on my neck the Norelco wasn&#x27;t getting, didn&#x27;t seem to be that close any more and shaving was taking to long. Tried cleaning and adjusting, things were better BUT. So I tried the Pulsar, easy to use out of the box, just plug it in and go. Easy to clean with included brush, breaks down easy and can be washed under the tap. I never even had to open and use the enclosed cleaner/charging base. Shave was faster on my cheeks/face, not as irritating. Neck was more of a problem, here the Norelco was faster and less irritating. For the money I expected better overall. This razor can not be returned/sent back as when it is charged it is considered \\&quot;hazardous material\\&quot;, something that is not mentioned in the  product description but is mentioned as part of the general Amazon return policy. So be aware of this for this product and possibly other rechargeable products. Clarify before you buy.</li>
    <li> I had this for 3 months so far and it worked great with a clean shave for 2 months.  I would have given this a 5 star at the time.      It stopped working after 2.5 months...emailled into Braun for warranty and got a response 1 week later telling me they make quality products and I can bring this to a service center or ship it at my expense for repair.  I also could have returned it within 60 days for money back.    I did not find Braun&#x27;s policy acceptable and would expect them to replace this at THEIR expense after 3 months of use and paying over $200 on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this razor, especially considering its price.  My concern was focused on the closeness of the shave and after using it for two weeks, I am very pleased with the shave that I get.  The other drag from using an electric was the cleanup, but it is effortless with this razor.  The two LEDs on the base station indicate the level of cleaner remaining and how \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; the razor is.  If you did not charge the razor for some reason, you can operate it as a corded shaver, as the power cord can be plugged directly into the razor.  Very nice product.  I had used one of the nivea norelco models, but hated the clean up.  The power turbo razor gives a marginally closer shave, but I was prone to cutting myself under my nose and below my lower lip.</li>
    <li> I bought it on  September  8-th;   in the  meantime--it is  O&#x27;kay--but  Not  &#x27; spectacular&#x27;,  I was  hoping for  much  better !!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used electric shavers for years but this one isn&#x27;t any better tahn the far cheaper Braun models.  It doesn&#x27;t do a good job on the neck and the  chin shaving is just ok.  another problem is the  cleaning system.  It is prone to spilling if it is moved so unless you want to leave the shaver always on the  counter (something my wife said no to) you won&#x27;t be abe to use the cleaning system.  I sent the shaver back to Braun for a refund.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d wait a full month (and cleaning cycle) to write this review, and I have to give this razor 5 stars almost across the board:  Shave quality - ***** - After a few days I would have given this only 4 stars, as it seemed only as good as the Braun 7526 I replaced with this razor.  But after a full 3 weeks or more, my face (or my technique) adjusted and this razor gives me a better shave than the 7526 in about the same time.  Comfort - ***** - This razor is far more comfortable than the 7526, not nearly as much irritation.  I took care of my 7526, replacing the blades and foil annually, but this is a far superior razor.  As a bonus, it is also quieter, which my wife likes too.  Cleaning - ***** - I have now run through a full cleaning cycle, and I think the automatic system helps save a bit of the fluid in the cartridge; I gained at least 4-5 days on the first cartridge over what I used to get (4 weeks).  Cartridge changing is just as easy as before.  Styling - *** - The Braun guys should have asked their auto compatriots for help here.  A silver razor, refrigerator white cleaning stand, and black power cord.  Not nearly as nice as the black on black of the 7526.  Just an esthetic issue, but you have to wonder what they were thinking.  Charging - it automatically charges each time you put it back in the cleaning unit, whether you clean it or not.  Much better than the old model where you had to select \\&quot;charge\\&quot; every time.  Overall, this is a great razor - I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of the sonic feature, but whatever, it works.  I wanted to be critical of this razor due to its cost, but it is a step above the $130-150 razor.</li>
    <li> I have ordered Braun Series 7- 760cc shaver at Amazon.com on June 23rd, and the Estimated shipping they have given me is June 29th. And the Worst thing about it is you are receiving the item only after July 6th or even later. I have never had such a bad experience with any other online shopping site. So, if you plan to order something through Supersaver shipping at Amazon.com, and you need it in within 10 days at the max., just forget it, or try through some other site. Horrible experience.</li>
    <li> I purchased the 760 after my Norelco rotary shaver&#x27;s(unknown model but it was the one of the most expensive models at the time)battery stopped lasting more than one shaving session.  I have had 2 Norelco rotary shavers, both of which gave mediocre shaves.  I also tried a Remington foil shaver which was slightly better but it irritated my skin and the switch broke after about a year.  I decided to bite the bullet and try the Braun 760.  I chose this model over the 790 because I really don&#x27;t need the digital display of the 790.  Plus, I don&#x27;t trust digital displays anymore.  My last Norelco had a digital display that showed how many minutes were left before needing a charge.  It would say 30 minutes but then it would suddenly die.  Anyways, I heard that it may take several weeks for your face to get used to the Braun.  Not so.  It worked beautifully the first time!  The shave was the closest I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric and it does an excellent job of shaving my head.  I haven&#x27;t tried the cleaning feature yet so I can&#x27;t comment.  The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is due to the design of foil shavers.  It doesn&#x27;t have a trap for the clippings and they tend to just fall on the sink.  Kinda messy but I think all foil shavers have this problem.  Other than that, this is an awesome shaver.  Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver for my husband (age 65) after reading reviews on several brands. He has owned at least 3 Norelco shavers but had problems with them holding up, which seems to have become the norm since Phillips became involved. I asked him how many stars would he rate it (with him being the user), and he replied, \\&quot;Probably 4 1/2 to 5.\\&quot; So since there is no 4 1/2...it&#x27;s a 5. He found out (the hard way) you need to rinse the head off before you use it after letting it clean in the solution. It will cause razor burn if you don&#x27;t, but shaves like a champ otherwise. His face is as smooth as when he used a blade &amp; shaving cream, and the cleaning is effortless. He uses the auto-cleaner about once a week, and puts the cap back on the solution to keep it from evaporating. I&#x27;ll see if I can mix up a similar cleaning product when this is used up. I see no need to buy much more of it if I can duplicate what&#x27;s in there, plus I can clean out the unit and easily reuse when it it gets low. I LOVE the way his face feels after he&#x27;s done, so there are actually 2 very satisfied customers for the Braun Pulsonic 9585.</li>
    <li> I compared this Pulsonic with the [[ASIN:B000PKKAFK Philips Norelco arcitec 1060 Men&#x27;s Shaving System]] and the [[ASIN:B000PJXS0K Panasonic ES8077 Linear Shaver with Vortex Hydraclean System]]. Obviously, every man&#x27;s face is different, so there is only so much utility in a description, but here goes:    I shaved half my face with one, the other half with another - with my wife providing objective testing of the shaved skin (she didn&#x27;t know which side was shaved with which until after). I shave using both a blade and an electric razor (this testing was to find a replacement for my old Panasonic 7000 series) so my skin is &#x27;used&#x27; to dry shaving with an electric.    I started with the Braun versus the Philips. No contest - the Braun won handily. The only things that the Arcitec had better were quietness and styling of the shaver (to my taste). The Arcitec was more irritating to my skin, and yet didn&#x27;t shave as close (a very poor combination). It is almost impossible to shave a straight line with the Arcitec (hence the name?) - which would prevent styling a Van Dyke or other facial hair patterns. The trimmer is small and awkwardly placed on the Philips. Even the packaging was bad - one of those hard plastic shrink wraps you have to cut through. Even though it was made in Holland, the Philips seemed a little plasticky in the handle portion, though the shave unit itself was very finely engineered. The Arcitec also offered neither the wet/dry shaving of the Panasonic nor the plug in useability of the Braun.    Next, comparing the Braun to the Panasonic. This was a much closer (pun intended) contest. The Pro-Curve shaved closer on 3 of 4 attempts (the only time it \\&quot;lost\\&quot; was after 3 days of no shaving - thus more stubble to deal with), according to my wife - I had trouble telling which side was a closer shave (i.e. both shaved very close to the skin). However, it was marginally more irritating to the skin - though nowhere near as bad as the Arcitec. The Pro-Curve is a smaller unit, though it is a fair bit louder than the Braun in use. The trimmer is almost the same as the Braun&#x27;s in terms of size and ease of use, and the build quality is fine. The Panasonic is made in China and has the best packaging, in terms of minimal material and ease of access. The Panasonic has the otherwise useful feature of being able to be used wet or dry, though for me this feature is less important since if I am going to use shaving cream, I&#x27;ll use a blade... Since the shave quality was almost identical, it was the Braun&#x27;s other elements that won the day in my decision of which shaver to keep.    The Braun, made in Germany, is excellently put together. It is the largest physically of the three compared shavers, in the middle as far as noise goes, and in the middle as far as packaging goes. It caused the least irritation to my skin and was the closest of the three on cutting the hairs on my neck. The travel case is plain plastic, but well designed to avoid accidental power up in a suitcase - a problem with the Panasonic design (the Arcitec has a long button press that disables the power for travelling). The other major feature that the Braun has is the ability to be run while plugged in - so if you run out of battery power, you don&#x27;t need to wait to recharge it before finishing your shave - just plug it in and keep shaving.  These features, combined with the lower cost for replacement shave-units, meant that my new shaver for the next decade or more (hopefully) will be the Pulsonic 9585.    I haven&#x27;t compared the cleaning of the three, since my testing was only over a two week period, so I didn&#x27;t use the included cleaning system(s) during the tests. The Arcitec didn&#x27;t have a cleaning apparatus - and is designed (well designed) to be cleaned in running water. It was very easy to clean the Philips. The Panasonic and the Braun both came with cleaning and recharging units (the Panasonic is water based, the Braun is alcohol based). Both of these latter units can be cleaned under running water as well as in their specialized cleaning systems, and both are relatively easy to clean using a tap, as would be the case if you are travelling with them.    While I didn&#x27;t use the Panasonic Hydra-Clean system, I examined its set up, and it is easy, but looks to be slightly susceptible to a breakdown of the plug connection when the shaver is inserted. The Braun, on the other hand, has the recharging take place by way of contact points, so there are less mechanical parts to that subsystem of the cleaning/charging base. Since I decided to keep the Braun, I used the base (once so far - I doubt I will use it everytime) - and it is extremely simple to use (and faster at ~1 hour compared to the ~3 hours estimated for the Panasonic base).    The only other factor I can speak to is the battery charging of the three shavers - and all three went from no charge to full in about an hour. I can&#x27;t say how many shaves this would give you since the batteries lasted for the entirety of my testing. Each of the three shavers had lights for showing how much battery power remains (with three levels on the Braun and the Panasonic, five on the Philips).     If you are contemplating this razor, I can heartily recommend it, especially since you can get your money back if you happen not to be satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for approximately three years and am on my third head now so I feel that I have extensively experienced this shaver.  In comparison with the Norelcos  that I have used almost all my shaving life the shaving experience with the Braun is somewhat rough.  Fairly quickly the shaving head could no longer be locked in a stiff position, and more recently the trimmer cannot be opened.  But the bottom line was and still is that this Braun gives the absolutely closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had (I have never used a blade).    Since I cannot use the base-cleaner (through no fault of Braun)) after consultation with experts, I clean the shaver after every shave by cleaning the head with the brush,  running hot water through the head and then running hot water through the head while it is attached to the shaver while it is running.  Once a week I put a drop of shaver lubricating oil on the head.  This seems to work fine and would be an option for those who don&#x27;t want to blow money on refills.  After about a half a year the shaver would suddenly stop running in middle of the shave and this happened with exasperating frequency. With the new-style heads this simply does not occur, either because they clean more thoroughly or because the new-style heads have less friction.  Again, the bottom line is that, though I have a very tough beard, it gives a superb shave.</li>
    <li> This is beyond a doubt the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. There&#x27;s no need to stretch the skin or to make multiple passes, and the close and smooth shaves come without any skin irritation. The cleaning facility also works well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m taking the time to write this because it was important to me when I was looking at what people where saying about razors...so I guess I&#x27;m trying to pay it forward.  I love this razor!  It cuts fast and clean with very few strokes.  It is amazing how it picks up even the hard to get whiskers that lay down or grow flat.  I didn&#x27;t think I would like the cleaning system (I used to just pop my old razor open and tap it out) but it is wonderful.  It cleans and lubricates the razor so it always feels clean and fresh.  My only criticizum is it is not as quiet as it could be while its cleaning - about 5 minutes or so - so I have learned to hit the clean button before I get in the shower otherwise its annoying.  One other thing... I bought mine online at Amazon for $200 (I know - ouch), but I looked at them every time I would see it for sale else where and $200 is a deal!  I was at Kohls Department Store this weekend - they had great deals on a lot of stuff but the razor regularly $300 was discounted to $260.</li>
    <li> I bought this Razor for my husband and he just loves it. The best he has ever had. It really takes him seconds to shave his face now. He loves how the razor cleans itself. Worth every penny. I will be buying one for my son</li>
    <li> Since i&#x27;ve bought the shaver ,the plastic cleaning base doesnt work well. Always lost contact with the shaver inside,loosing all the cleaning process...too bad!!</li>
    <li> I have had three electric razors before I purchased the Braun.   This, by far. is the ultimate electric razor.   The ease of handling, the sensational close shave in the most difficult places and the ease of cleaning the Braun makes it worth every penny.   I am extremely satisfied with the closeness of the shave and the lack of irritation to my skin.  A great product!</li>
    <li> This product definitely lives up to its reputation closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric razor and its comfortable. The cleaning cycle isn&#x27;t that loud I find. Maybe only slightly louder than when the razor is in use.</li>
    <li> This shaver is the most comfortable shave I have had from an electric. What it does shave is very close for an electric shaver also. However I still find that it misses about 5% of my beard mostly on my neck. Now I have not used it the entire 3 weeks yet that they recommend so I&#x27;m still waiting to see if it improves.At the moment though I am a little disappointed after reading such good reviews. Overall I think it is a good shaver but it is not perfect.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband not knowing anything about electric razors, so I really had to go off of the reviews.  All I have to say is that he is very happy with this razor with nothing negative to say about it. He loves the close shave and not having irritated skin since he has to shave everyday for work. I&#x27;m glad I bought this for him and he is too!</li>
    <li> I tried Brauns 370, 560, and this 760. None shave as smoothly and comfortable as my old 7526--although all of these are fairly good. This 760 pulls beard once in a while--I imagine because of the more big-toothed and aggressive middle cutter bar.  The automatic cleaning well for alcohol seems messy, space-consuming, and more expensive than it&#x27;s worth. Just another expensive part to order periodically.  I got rid of it.  We should have the choice of buying the shaver without this.    The good old 7526 can still be purchased on the internet.  Braun should start selling them again.  Make that automatic cleaning well truly optional!</li>
    <li> I bought the Braun 7-760 as a gift for my fiancee and he seems to like it.  The only feedback I could got from him is that it was easy to use and it gave a smooth shave.  His dad owns one so he had used one before and knew that it was a good one.  It did take him a couple times to get used to it, apparently the first time you use it, you break out.  But that could be something with all new shavers.  All I know is that he uses it now regularly, except for the few tough to get spots, sometimes he has to run his shick over the missed spots.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had other versions of Braun shavers and this is the best one so far.  The auto cleaning mechanism is great, the only problem is that the refil is expensive.    -R</li>
    <li> I am uncomfortable with the reality of this advertisement. Its sounds off with phony brouhaha...&lt;br /&gt;The speaker attempts to be authentic but fails with such a  corny performance.&lt;br /&gt;I would never buy anything from this unbelievable pretender.</li>
    <li> I have been using electric shavers for more than 20 years. My last one was a Braun Activator 8585. My new Pulsonic shaver is much qieter, gentler on the skin and gives a closer shave. No problems with about two months of daily (nearly) usage. Takes care of the shave even I miss a day.</li>
    <li> I replaced my previous Braun after 5 years. This one shaves closer and has a better trimmer. Assumming it holds up for another 5 years, would buy again.</li>
    <li> Have purchased all Braun razors prior to this one and all good but, this one is the best at this time!</li>
    <li> If you can spare the extra cash for it, it is a very nice razor.  If money is tight, I am not sure you would be missing out on all that much by selecting a less expensive model.  I&#x27;ve been using the low-end Braun foil shavers for years (~$50 or so) and I have always been happy with them.  This time around I decided to splurge and see what I have been missing.  After using it for almost 3 months I am sure this gives a closer shave than the less expensive model I had been using and I don&#x27;t think it takes as long to shave, but I would guess it is maybe a minute faster at most and after an hour or two, I doubt anyone could tell which model I had shaved with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I purchased it I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with needing to keep buying the cleaning cartridges, but now I will never buy another razor without some sort of built in cleaning system.  I imagine it will make the cutter and foil last longer, but I love not having to clean up after shaving every day. The included cartridge just started showing as low, but only after I spilled it by accident.  When I shave everyday, it calls for a quick cleaning after the first shave and a regular cleaning after the second one. I skip the quick cleanings as per the advise of another reviewer, which is probably why it has lasted 3 months.  I signed up for delivery of a 2 pack every 6 months and I expect that will be sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think there is some room for improvement in the power cord.  The plug is huge and sticks out of the socket 3\\&quot; or so.  I would also prefer if it were white so that it would match the base and be at least a little less noticeable on the vanity.  Also, you should note the size of the base - it took up a little more space than I expected.  The cleaning fluid will spill if you move it around, so you need a place to keep it where you won&#x27;t need to move it very often.</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing.  Smooth results, no razor burn, and a chore made pleasant.  It actually makes me WANT to shave in the mornings.  That says more than anything else can!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a an electric regularly so I won&#x27;t compare this to any other electric.  I will, however, say that if you want to be clean cut all over, stick with a real razor.    My facial hair is coarse and evenly spread, with thicker growth on the chin and lips.  In those areas, so long as the hair is growing straight out, this shaver excels.      However the shave is much less than satisfactory on the neck.  Generally, I have to go over this area repeatedly, and then am usually forced to use the edger of the shaver to lift and cut the dozen or so remaining hairs.  All in all, I&#x27;m not too worried about having the perfect shave, but I&#x27;m surprised how well this was rated.    Key question to ask yourself if you are considering the switch to an electric:  Which is more of a priority -- saving time using the electric to get a sub-razor, but still okay shave?? Or would you rather be spending the time to get a good shave using a real razor?    Having a great shave is only necessary on Friday and Saturday for me, so this works great to show up presentable in the lab.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I have ever had.  After two weeks it still doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, but I have never used an electric that has.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my face at all.  I don&#x27;t even mind shaving anymore.  Buy it!</li>
    <li> Shaving with Electric shavers for over 50 years. By far the best so far. I haven&#x27;t recharged it yet and I use it daily for the past 3 weeks. Finally a razor I can rave about!</li>
    <li> I really like the new shaver.  I previously used a Braun and trusted the name.  This one is a much closer shave.  Haven&#x27;t used the cleaning system yet... seems to me it&#x27;s gonna be a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000Z2KR9W Braun Mens Pulsonic Shaving System]]    I have been buying Braun Electric Razors for years and years. Each year, Braun comes up with a measurably better product.    The Pulsonic Razor is superb. It is clearly a case of \\&quot;getting what you pay for\\&quot;.    I can&#x27;t imagine what improvement will come next year. Perfect is about as good as it gets, right?</li>
    <li> This thing is super expensive and one might think after all the expense that they wouldn&#x27;t have to shell out more money but leave it to Proctor &amp; Gamble- Braun&#x27;s Owner- to find ways to milk you for money!  First you have to buy the cleaning trays which last only a month and will run you about $60 per year. Then you need a new shaving block after a year and a half which is another $50. And after shelling out all this money you will have a shaver that takes twice as long as a manual and will never shave as close or as well.</li>
    <li> Shaver does not shave as close as I expected.I have to go over areas of my face several times and press very hard for a smooth shave.  the best feature is that it does not irritate the skin.</li>
    <li> This shaver works very well with much less irritation than others I have owned.    I recieved it for Christmas (when I don&#x27;t shave every day) and used before I went back to work.  It handled the 4 days growth with no pulls or discomfort.  Also, the shave was close and took less time.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for almost a month now.  It is comfortable, reasonably quiet, holds a charge well and actually shaves reasonably well. (Still no match for a blade.) The cleaning base with the cleaning fluid is an unnecessary gimick.  It takes space and requires the purchase of fluid. It is easier to run it under hot water.  The other issue is that Amazon lowered the price by $50 a week after I purchased the rasor.</li>
    <li> Simply the best, better than all the rest.    I have owned many electric shavers from Braun, Remington, Norelco, No frills brands etc. This one out shines them all in every category its like using shaving cream and a blade.    The reviewer who said they had used a Braun Shaver for 17 years then tried this and didn&#x27;t like it saying his old one was better well after that many years. Your going to have to give any razor some time for your skin, hair etc to get use to it.    It charges fast and cleans even faster, The closeness of the shave is good at 6 months as it was when first used!    The main question is do you want to spend this much on a razor well if you want a very close shave and high quality precision then the answer is yes!</li>
    <li> Without a doubt the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. People do yourself a favor buy this shaver you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I will tell you what anyone who gave this shaver a bad review must be cracked, I have never been able to use a electric shaver because my beard is so heavy every one I used didn&#x27;t even touch it, just pulled and pinched my hair. I decided what the heak I will try another one. Man this thing is awesome I had about 3 days of stubble this thing went right through it like a hot knife to butter I can&#x27;t believe it this thing it is a little pricey but you know you get what you pay for. If your wondering about its performance don&#x27;t just get it I am glad I did.</li>
    <li> Gives a clean shave quickly.  Poor quality travel case.  Would be happier if alcohol were not needed in the charger.</li>
    <li> Although this razor promises all sorts of results, my husband hates it and spends more time going over, and over, and over the same spots to get it to cut, especially on the neck area.  Not impressed at all and should have done way more research BEFORE buying.  Too bad there is no return policy on this horrible razor as we are stuck with this expensive mistake!</li>
    <li> Not the best as I thought it would be.  There is better. Does an average job.</li>
    <li> For about forty years I have been using strictly electric Braun shavers. From a corded single screen one to now this Pulsonic three knife system.  My previous model was the 7526 and very similar, in fact the closeness of shave is the same. There are a few improvements: the body is easier to grip, battery is improved, and the cleaning system has more choices. In using the shaver I also like the angle that the cutting head has to the body of the shaver, when locking the cutting head it becomes even better.  If I have to find fault anywhere it would be the trimmer; it is somewhat flimsy and awkward to use but it works.  All in all the Braun gives you a shave as close as an electric shaver can and works well around problem areas like the throat and angles of the lower jaw. The cleaning system is also worth it because it cleans, lubricates, desinfects and charges the shaver with just a push of the button. How easy is that?  In close to forty years none of the Brauns I used has quit on me and this one makes my wife even happier!</li>
    <li> I have a 7526 and the little bumpers that stabilize it in the cleaner stand broke off within 2 years and it would no longer clean. When I e-mailed Braun about it, they e-mailed back and said I could get a new one at a service center. I was not about to purchase another one when they don&#x27;t hold up, so I spent a lot of extra money for nothing. I hesitate to buy another one at these prices when they don&#x27;t stand behind their product. Are the cleaning stands any better made now?</li>
    <li> A good razor, if a bit noisy.  Be ready to hear it when you hit the clean button!  It is really nice to have the cleaning station though.    It shaves beard hairs as close as my older rotary shaver.  But it does feel much smoother on the skin than the older rotaries.  Also, the head does not heat up nearly as much while shaving.    It is a great gadget, but the price tag at twice as much as other shavers does not mean twice as good.  However, I don&#x27;t miss cleaning the old rotary shaver, and that is worth something too.</li>
    <li> I waited a month before posting a review to see what the results would be like and I have to say that I&#x27;m disappointed based on my expectations.  This top of the line shaver is pricey and I was upgrading from a middle range Panasonic brand electric shaver which was OK but I thought I could do better.  I wanted a closer shave on the face and better capability on my neck.  I think it is maybe 10-20% better than my previous shaver when it comes to closeness and accuracy, but not enough to justify the super high price.      Perhaps the premium price is accounted for by the cleaning system which does an excellent job.  My biggest complaint is how LOUD the cleaning action is.  I thought other reviewers were exaggerating but it is VERY LOUD.  I don&#x27;t run it in the morning before I go to work since I live in an apartment and don&#x27;t want to disturb my neighbors at 7AM.  I&#x27;m not kidding.  It isn&#x27;t a continuous sound but when it goes on it is like running the vacuum cleaner for a few seconds every few minutes.  I have resorted to rinsing it with water once a week and running the Intensive clean mode (you don&#x27;t get a choice, the unit decides for you) on the weekend.    Overall it is a quality built, sleek looking, and above average electric shaver.  I don&#x27;t know if there is anything better on the market if your face is a challenge to get a smooth feeling stubble free shave.  The trimmer isn&#x27;t as sharp as my previous Panasonic either which is a big surprise.  I only slightly recommend this model, more so if the price was under $100.</li>
    <li> My precedent shaver was Panasonic ES8096. Perfect! But new Braun Pulsonic works better and faster. With Braun Pulsonic it takes less time to fully shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 10+ year braun user. My first braun was in the 5000 series; I&#x27;ve upgraded every 4 years or so when it was time to replace the foil block and blades for the 3rd time (each time this coincided with a very good deal making the new razor too good to pass up). Braun products are great; all do a fine job under the nose and on the cheeks, and seem to have some problem under the chin. I decided to trade up from the 8xxx series to the 9585.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new model has a much more mobile foil screen, which unlike earlier models is in one block (blade plus foil). It also makes a somewhat different, higher pitched sound, like the older panasonic \\&quot;ultrasonic\\&quot; shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the shave was a disappointment. Shaver did a good job on the cheeks in terms of closeness, but left my face feeling sore. Under the bottom lip the shaver cut me; and it was no better at the under the chin stuff. As for closeness, pretty good but the shave was no better than my previous braun razor. So after gutting it out for about two weeks I called up braun and sent it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave dry and before washing my face, as is recomended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun says getting a check will take 10 weeks. I&#x27;ll buy a new foil block for the 8585. Still wish someone had a better answer for the neck &amp; under-the-chin hair.</li>
    <li> I have a tough (quirky) beard that requires daily shaving. So if I shave every 24 hours, almost any shaver will do. If I go 48 hours, then I really have to work at it, going over certain areas again &amp; again. After 72 hours, I have to get out the old double edge Gillette razor. Much to my pleasant surprise, the Braun 9585 will take off a 72 hour growth with little more effort than a 24 hour beard. It won&#x27;t give your a closer shave than many others (the thickness of the foil prevents that) however, this baby will take it off better &amp; faster than anything else. It&#x27;s very expensive though; I only bought it because I was able to combine several discounts etc. So, if you always shave every day &amp; don&#x27;t have a particularly tough beard ... save your money. If however, you&#x27;re like me, this baby is a dream come true.</li>
    <li> Overall, a good electric shaver. However, there is still no electric that can match a good razor shave, such as provided by a \\&quot;multi-blade\\&quot; model razor. The self-cleaning feature works well and it provides an adequate shave and is certainly more convenient than a regular razor.</li>
    <li> My husband had an older version of this electronic shaver for several years before it gave out. Knowing how much he loved the shave with it, I had little reservation on purchasing the newer top-of-the-line model for a Christmas gift. It is much quieter than what he had and a has a much sleeker design. Note, it does take a couple weeks for your skin to get used to the product to really experience the full benefit of a close shave. Would recommend highly.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000Q6UPYE Braun Series 7- 760cc Shaver]]I purchased this shaver with high expectations where it is priced higher than most shavers.  My expectations were exceeded!!! I have used the shaver for 6 months now and am still impressed with the close shave and ease of use and care of the shaver.  Even after 3 days off, the shave the next morning was clean and simple ... no pulling out hairs like some of my previous shavers.  I&#x27;d suggest this shaver for anyone!!</li>
    <li> I have been using a Braun model 8585 for the past 4 Years. I have been having some problems with it so I decided to replace it with this model. Since my face was already conditioned for electric razor usage,I saw immediate results when I used this razor for the first time. I can&#x27;t believe how smooth and comfortable this razor leaves my face. I was wasting my time with the old unit. This might sound crazy but, I actually can&#x27;t wait to shave in the morning now! This thing is that good! It is also much more quiet than my previous model. This razor is a must have! Absolutely awesome!</li>
    <li> I have been using an Eltron Electric Razor (made by Braun) for over twenty years..Yes, the same razor. There is a local razor shop that has kept it running with blades, screens and several motors.  Recently, I was told that there are no longer parts. Hmmm, so it was time to research the replacement. I read multiple reviews on electric razors..and time after time (including here on Amazon) the Series 7 was at top of the list. I subsequently purchased this product at Amazon.  Wow, the reviews before me were right.  Smooth shaving with no iritation. This is the closet shave ever experienced from an electric razor.  I use the automatic cleaning cycle ever few days..and in between, just a little brushing around the shaver head and rinse under water.  I am totally satisfied with the product and have already recommended it to friends.</li>
    <li> Purchased the Pulsonic to replace my aging Baun 7526. I really want to like this razor but it significantly falls short of my expectations. Expected the Pulsonic to give at least as close a shave as my 7526 but it clearly does not perform as well based on my tests.    Shaved with the Pulsonic for the usual amount of time I typically shave for. Pulsonic is light and feels nice in one&#x27;s hand. Shave felt ok, no irritation. However immediately after using the Pulsonic I shaved with my 7526. I was amazed at how many whiskers I could hear the 7526 cutting.    Today I shaved with the Pulsonic for double the amount of time it takes me to get a close shave with the 7526. My goal was to get an equally as close shave as the 7526. My face feels as if I did a rush job with the 7526 as I can feel stubble on my face especially on my neck area and chin.    For the amount of money I paid for the Pulsonic (more than double what I could buy a 7526 for) I am very disappointed in the performance of this razor hence the one star rating. It simply doesn&#x27;t live up to the marketing hype. I will be returning mine and purchasing a 7526 to replace my existing 7526 which has served me well for 5 years but has a problem with the on/off switch.</li>
    <li> My husband says that it is the best shaver he has ever had.  It shaves close and comfortably.</li>
    <li> This is not my first Braun shaver. It is actually the third one, so you can not blame me prejudicial against them. My previous one was the top of the line 10 years ago, but it finally started dying out. This one shaves faster as they claim, probably due to the Pulsonic vibration system, however I have two complaints against it. The old one used to give me a closer shave, though at the expense of occasional skin irritation. This one is almost never causing that, probably because of the cleanup system. But the system itself is big hassle, with the necessity to keep the base around, ordering the cleaning solution, and the need to be careful around that base, as it contains the open tank with the solution which would leak out if you knock it over.</li>
    <li> I upgraded from a 5000 model, and this thing is amazing!  Braun is the only shaver I&#x27;ll use!</li>
    <li> Well if you have looked at the overall reviews for this shaver, everyone seems to love it. I just felt like it was important to share my opinion incase somebody else feels the same as me.    Pro:The product design and most of the features are really amazing. I love the self cleaning option and the design of the shaver; but I would not recommend buying this shaver.    Con: I guess my skin and the structure of my face is different than the majority of the people that have posted because this shaver does a horrible job shaving my neck line. I have to go over my neck multiple times and it still leaves hair behind. Shaving my face takes over 15 minutes with this, and it definitely starts to get warm/a little hot at that point.  It does do a good job shaving my sideburns and the rest of my face, but for the hefty price tag and all the advertising for it being the best shave ever, I would definitely disagree.    I have no other complaints about this product, just that it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of what it is supposed to- shave my facial hair.</li>
    <li> Not happy spending 190.00 on a razor that doesn&#x27;t cut neck hairs &amp; leaves rashes all over neck.Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Clean function is great.  So far has given excellent shave.  The price is the only item to complain about.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Phillips/Norelco electric razors since I switched from shaving with cream/razor about 10 years ago.  My beard is moderately heavy - a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow in 2 days and I don&#x27;t use any pre-shave treatment.  When my discount store razor broke I decided to step up and buy something that would last and give me a fast quality shave.  I rec&#x27;d the product on a Friday, charged it like the manual said, inserted the cleaning cartridge and shaved with it for the first time on Saturday morning.  First of all, I was not prepared for the noise!!  Not quite a chainsaw, but close to a leaf blower!!  And the vibration was weird - may be ok for the wife, but kinda rattled my fillings!!  It took a little longer to shave than normal, which I accepted since it was new and I was getting used to it.  I went fishing on Sunday and skipped the shave, but was back in action Monday morning.  It did not handle the two day beard well at all!  Besides the pile of shavings all over the bathroom counter it took A LOT longer to shave than it would have with my old $50 razor!!  The square head is not very easy to navigate around my nose - and no like most of me, it&#x27;s average too! Not acceptable for a $200 high tech razor.  I&#x27;m not waiting 30 days to send it back - I called the company y&#x27;day and it&#x27;s in the mail for a refund today!!  To add insult to injury, I have to pay the shipping!!</li>
    <li> The new Braun Series razor is top notch. It even feels like a manual razor handle. Recommended for those who prefer electrics.</li>
    <li> I am still getting used to it, but so far its a 10 out of 10! I have never used anything but a razor so this was a big change for me. I have sensitive skin and so far have had no problems.</li>
    <li> I received the razor for Christmas, and I thought I&#x27;d wait a few months before writing my review.  I previously owned a 3-foil Braun razor (can&#x27;t remember the model), and I was very happy with it.  I have a fairly average face, with neck hair that is tough to get to.  The razor worked well right out of the box.  Compared to my old razor, the 760 gives me a closer shave.  I agree with a review above: it is physically impossible for an electric razor to shave as close as a blade. This is not a magic tool.  That being said, this is definitely the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric.  Braun recommends you shave before you shower.  After 30 years of shaving, I&#x27;m not going to change my habits, so I shave after my shower.  The razor comes equipped with 2 long-hair trimmers.  It has a standard flip-up side-burn trimmer.  Works well.  It also has a built-in set of cutters nestled down between the foils.  On my old Braun, every day, I had to raise the side-burn trimmer to catch those couple of long hairs that I might have missed the day before.  The foil didn&#x27;t catch them.  That is NOT the case with the 760.  I never raise the side-burn trimmer to catch long hairs.  The second trimmer continuously catches any longer hairs.  Works great!  This is also the most comfortable shave I have ever had with an electric.  Very smooth, never pulls, glides over the face.  This is probably its strongest feature for me.  I have been a little concerned about the battery.  Most battery-operated equipment recommends that you let the battery run down to some extent before you recharge it.  With the 760, if you store it in its cleaning base, it recharges every use.  Maybe I&#x27;m just an old-timer, but this doesn&#x27;t seem good for the battery.  I have decided to only charge (and clean) the razor once every 2 weeks.  Every other Sunday, I plug in the cleaning base, then clean and charge the razor.  At the end of 2 weeks, the \\&quot;low battery\\&quot; light just starts to flash, and seems like a great timeto charge it.  Speaking of the cleaning base, I also am not overly thrilled about having to continuously buy cleaning packs for it.  Another way for companies to keep you on their hook.  What I do is manually remove the cutting head each use and dump out the whiskers.  Every other Sunday, when I charge it, I also run the cleaning cycle.  Since it has been more than a couple of days between cleanings, it automatically runs the \\&quot;intensive\\&quot; cleaning.  After 2 months, the fluid level indicator still indicates \\&quot;full\\&quot; so I guess this seems to be working.  It comes out of the cleaning with sparkling cutters.  It&#x27;s a little loud when cleaning.  The unit turns the shaver on inside a plastic enclosure, so it is a bit loud.  However, it only runs a minute or so, so it is an extremely MINOR point.  I saw a couple of reviews mention this, but this has NOT been a big issue at all.  When actually shaving, it is about average.  No problem.  The plug for the unit is really huge.  It sticks out of the wall about 3 1/2\\&quot;.  Poor ergonomic design.  I keep mine unplugged except during the bi-weekly charge / clean.  When it&#x27;s time to replace the cutting head (Braun estimates 18 months) I&#x27;m sure that will be expensive.  The foils, cutters, etc are one unit.  Haven&#x27;t priced it.  Overall, a great shaver.  You&#x27;ll have to decide what price you pay for a close, comfortable shave.  For something I use every day, it is worth it to me.  PROS:  Extremely comfortable shave  Very close shave  Cleaning system works well    CONS:  Plug sticks out into your counter  Will have to buy cleaning solution eventually</li>
    <li> Worked great for a month then the battery died and wont hold a charge , dont waste your money</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun shavers for a few years my previous model was the Activator and it was the best shaver I ever used. I decided it was time to try a new model and the 760 does not disappoint at all, in fact I knew it would be good but it is even better than expected. It shaves hard to get get spots on my neck better than previous models and does not get as hot when doing so. The trimmer is very sharp and does it&#x27;s job well, also the body is very comfortable to hold and the angle of the head has been improved and is perfect in it&#x27;s placement for a easy grip while keeping the head at 90 degree angle. I love how well the cleaning system works an the Braun it is like using a new shaver every time. It is a bit expensive but well worth the price so if you afford it get it my opinion there is nothing better. A+</li>
    <li> Hey!    I was really looking forward to an incredible shave and a cool, well designed product.    It does has a nice smooth glide across my face but, having a goatee it can be an instrument of TERROR! Becuase if you don&#x27;t angle the shaver the right way, when you get close to your goatee it&#x27;ll yank out hairs and it hurts!!!    so I figured out a way to shave right up to my goatee by using the shaver and running it across and toward the goatee from my sideburn and it doesn&#x27;t yank in the same way. I know that buying the cleaning solution is a bit pricey but I like that it reminds me to clean it and it is easy. I actually like the smell of the shaver after it&#x27;s been cleaned using the cleaning system. Design wise it&#x27;s a bit disappointing. For something so expensive I expected a really cool streamlined design and it&#x27;s basically your run of the mill chunky design, but it works so... I got a GREAT price on amazon but if I were to have paid the store price of $240.00 plus tax, I think I would have returned it. I guess I expected the Rolls Royce of shavers and it&#x27;s more like a caddy!</li>
    <li> Awesome shaver , a bit pricey, but worth it. Great close shave , holds charge well. Use it daily.</li>
    <li> They say that this is the closest you can get to a razor blade. Its not that close. Blades dull after 2 weeks of use...</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and in good condition. Package contains the 760CC Pulsonic Razor, the cleaning/charging base, the power cord, one cleaning solution tank, a travel case with cleaning brush, a small bottle of blade oil and the paperwork. The Razor charges quickly in the base and produces an almost unbelievable shave. Following Braun&#x27;s exhortation to shave before washing your face, this razor&#x27;s high oscillation rate produces a comfortable and smooth shave while also being quiet and steady. I have a thick beard with lots of flat-growth and the 760CC cuts it well when used as directed. The razor is very solid in the hand. The same can&#x27;t quite be said for the cleaning/charging base. It lacks weight and solidity, especially compared to the one used with my old Braun 8585 Activator, and it&#x27;s a shade of the lightest gray. That said, the base does work fine and it stays put once the cleaning tank is inserted into it. It determines the cleaning effort needed and seems to use the cleaning solution very slowly. The razor does emerge each morning clean as a whistle. The built-in sideburns trimmer isn&#x27;t as good for me as the old one because the trimmer is slightly narrow and curved. The power cord fits the base and the razor itself for travel use. All in all, a terrific product I use daily to great effect and would rate a 5-star effort were it not for the lightweight base. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Braun 9585 (760cc) for a little over 16 months, and recently I noticed that the silver paint is coming off in small pieces near the swivel head revealing a large black plastic area where the large \\&quot;CAUTION\\&quot; lettering appears. I believe this is as a result of the head-end being subjected to elevated temperatures during the cleaning process. Unfortunately these small silver pieces migrate into the swivel head area and the cleaning bowl, requiring manual removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately the limited warranty is for 24 months, so I will now contact Braun and file my complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the above problem, I like the shaver.</li>
    <li> I have been a blade shaver for 45 years because blades result in a consistently close shave, albeit a bit slow and requiring warm water and shaving cream and a rinse.  Periodically, at intervals or 10-20 years I have tried an electric shaver and been disappointed.  A month ago I tried the Braun 760 shaver.  At first I was skeptical.  It comes with a garage that has to be kept in cleaning solution.  I thought it might be easier to blow it off to clean it.  It looked like Braun was trying to make a living off consumables, like Gillette (relatively inexpensive shavers with costly blades to be replaced weekly. The shaver actually provides a  close shave similar if not better than a blade without skin irritation.  It is much quicker and does not require softening with warm water or lather.  In fact, Braun recommends that you shave before you wash your face.  The automatic cleaning cycle seems to work ok with a touch of a button.  The cleaning solution [[ASIN:B0009RL86E Braun Clean &amp; Renew Refills (3 Pack)]]is relatively cheap (3 for $19 on Amazon)and last for 6-8 weeks.  The device charges in the garage and cleans with a touch of a button. It is easy to use, without skin irritation, cuts or much attention,  A quick touch uptakes 30 seconds.  A serious shave will only take a minute or two.  It is painless even if you skip 2 or 3 days.  I plan to keep my blade for travel, but I may give that up too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this 7 series in 2009 and now 4 years later the blade/foil need to be replaced for the first time. If you take good care of the product it will last.</li>
    <li> I used the Panasonic ES8077 for a couple of years, then bought a Panasonic ES8228 last December.  They were both OK.  Shaving with a Panasonic Linear model is definitely comfortable.  They&#x27;re also very convenient to clean, being water-resistant.  However, given my rough beard and preference for the convenience of dry-shaving, it took far too long to get a decent shave and even then, substantial stubble remained.  I recently switched to a Braun Series 7 and the shave is *much* closer and *much* faster.  I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he said it works great --- I would recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Having used a Braun shaver for decades and discovering they give the closest shaves, I decided to acquire a new one with more recent technology built in. After much research, the Braun 700 series seemed the best choice and has proven to be exceptional in its close shaves and easy clean-up and storage. I highly recommend this shaver for daily home use.</li>
    <li> What a tremendous improvement over my previous Braun Model 5775 which lasted only four years and then, slowly at first, died after no longer holding the charge.  One day it was just dead.   This Braun Model 760cc has now been working every day giving a close and comfortable shave for about six weeks and has yet to require a charge.  Unbelievable!</li>
    <li> Amazingly close shave I have ever had with an electric shaver. I have used a double edge razor 50 years and this Braun Series 7-760cc Shaver works just as good.</li>
    <li> It gives me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Even th girlfreind noticed \\&quot;how smooth\\&quot;. However it comes with a lot of Instructions on cleaning and a host of other things, which to this day I still have&#x27;nt read.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver I have ever used. It forms to your face very nicely. It takes a few passes to get all the hair off, but it does get it all. The only draw back to this device is the lock feature on it. After a few weeks of using the product it completely broke off. It is only held on by a small peace of plastic. Which will break very easily if you actually use the lock feature, and to get the hair under your nose and above your lip, you really need to use it. Well it broke within a few weeks of using it. If this one thing would be fixed it would be the perfect electric shaver. So now I am returning it to the Bruan company and looking for a different one.</li>
    <li> After a couple weeks to learn technique and let my beard adapt this electric shaver is a nice change from roazors and shaving cream. The cleaning system seems to work quite well, though I have yet to find replacements for the cleaning fluid locally.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using my old razor to clean up around my mustache, have not found a way for the razor to do that without risking the whole &#x27;stache will get cut offf.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, to replace his last Braun.  I did some research and this was getting good reviews.  Holy wow it&#x27;s expensive!  So hubby likes it well enough, but it&#x27;s large...his old Braun was more compact and seemed to fit his face better.  Since I&#x27;m not using it, I can&#x27;t give your more specifics on how well it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that the little door flap for the built in trimmer stopped closing early on...it sort of stays flopped open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that paying for the cleaner is an ongoing expense/racket.  It costs around $11 for a two pack.  Sometimes, when they are new and full, the first few cleaning cycles will splatter greasy/alcohol solution on the shelf where it sits.  Not fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not so sure I would buy one of these again.  I think they are overpriced, and the ongoing expense for cleaner make it even more expensive.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver about 2 1/2 years ago, and have the following long term review to report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Clean and renew cartridges usage is about 1 a month.  Ongoing replacement of the clean and renew cartridges $5-6 each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Shaves ok.  Pulsonic?  yeah whatever.  I still have to make multiple passes over tough areas, didn&#x27;t seem to shave any faster than my 3 head shaver.  Close shave?  Yeah, but so is my $40 3 head shaver with multiple passes.  I honestly don&#x27;t see what the big deal with a pulsonic action is.  You couldn&#x27;t prove it shaved any closer or faster by my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  BIG DEFECT.  The beard/sideburns trimmer breaks after about 2 years of use.  The entire trimmer flip out assembly is make of thin plastic, and it just fatigues and breaks in half after about 2 years.  Guess how long the warranty is?.... GET IT?  Plan on doing without your razor while it gets fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement foil cutter head is $30.  Cleaning and Renew cartridges are about $5-6 or so each.  It&#x27;s going to need the beard/sideburns trimmer replaced just after the warranty expires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that for $214 plus tax, it is an incredible ripoff.  Never again will I get suckered into spending that amount of money on a shaver.  It&#x27;s just not that reliable, well built or long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money - buy a $40 three head shaver.  You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this for about four months so I may be a good judge.  It gives a very close shave something like a razor.  I have a lot of facial hairs which grow wildly in different directions specially  on my neck so shaving is always a difficult thing for me.  Although this machine gives a close shave but it&#x27;s not a major advantage over  my old cheap rotary shaver which I was using for 10 years without any maintenance.  I had and still have problem with very inclined hairs on my neck.  The cleaning dock is a very lovely noisy thing.  It feels very nice when your shaver smells new everyday.</li>
    <li> My husband only likes BRAUN shavers, uses them for many years now. Bought him a new one recently and he is happy with this one , too</li>
    <li> Be really careful when selecting this and other Braun shavers because you will be stuck with it for at least ten years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a Braun 8595 TEN YEARS AGO and it still works like new so I have no valid reason to upgrade to this model, the 760/790.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so tempting though b/c I love gadgets and since I&#x27;m stuck with shaving every day I like to keep a quality shaver on hand.&lt;br /&gt;I kinda wish this would break so I could upgrade without feeling wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an era where marketers and manufacturers aren&#x27;t interested in quality, Braun seems still to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems more common that companies make cheap junk that breaks often enough to make it more profitable yet not often enough for most people to get angry enough and to avoid their products. (Don&#x27;t do this. Stop buying junk and they&#x27;ll stop making junk)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to Braun for NOT following this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow about the shave:&lt;br /&gt;- Nothing beats a real razor but a Braun can come as close to a razor without the mess and time of shaving with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;- If you have a light beard you can get away with a few days until you should use a real razor.&lt;br /&gt;- It seems to have difficulties with picking up flat-laying hairs but if you pull your skin a bit, it helps to stand the hair up for cutting.</li>
    <li> After spending about $249.00 at my local  home goods store I was positive that I had bought the best shaver there is, boy was I wrong, this unit broke within six months, the head would not lock ( head swivels) the unit did not make contact with the base so I found my self wiggling the shaver till contact was made, also when I press the button for cleaning the blue light would come on and go off on the cleaner base but  never got cleaned  and there were times that I did not find out till I had to shave again, if I unplug and plug the cleaner it will reset and clean as it was meant to work. I called Braun regarding all this issues when it was still under warranty and they told me to ship it  to a repair shop ( I had to ship it at my own cost).  When I call this place the person that answer the phone was not polite and every question I ask he sounded like he was doing me a favor, so i decide it to keep it and deal with this problematic unit.&lt;br /&gt;If I were to buy another one or when have to get another shaver I will stay away from any Braun  shaver or any Braun products,  they seem to be  design to break and take your money with parts and products that you have to use to keep it up.</li>
    <li> OK, i&#x27;ve had a Braun 7000 series for the last couple years.  i really liked it, but still knew i&#x27;d get a quicker closer shave using a blade in the shower. so i used my old braun on weekends and days off and for touchups. a good shaver...  i decided recently i would really like to use an electric full-time.  I flinched at the price of the pulsonic, but thought it would work for a Christmas present, rather than have my wife waste money on me for stuff I&#x27;d never use.... The first time I used the 9585 I was amazed at the lack of any drag across your face. It literally felt like you were running a smooth object across your skin- almost like vacuuming your face!  The shave is an unbelievable improvement over the 7000 series.  If you consider the set-up time to use a blade with water and lather etc., I would say the 9585 is actually faster than blade shaving- and probably 95% as close - almost 100% as close if your skin is taut at the time.  It is worth every penny if you want to move over to an electric.  I read somewhere that it&#x27;s recommended you shave before washing your face and also that you be up and moving around for 15 minutes or so before shaving.  That sounds trivial but it is actually a good point- your face is somewhat puffy at wakeup from being in a prone position and that puffiness does make a slight difference in the razor&#x27;s ability to get to facial hair.  For me- since i get up real early and can&#x27;t afford to stand around for 15 minutes- i shave as soon as I&#x27;m up and then run it back over my face again after showering and dressing.  Works great- you can&#x27;t beat this one if you are willing to pony up the asking price!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant at first to buy a self-cleaning electric shaver because of the additional cost for the cleaning cartridges, but decided to buy this anyway, as the price was attractive and the shaver can also be cleaned under running water - I figured I didn&#x27;t have to use the \\&quot;clean &amp; renew\\&quot; feature if I didn&#x27;t want to.    I chose the Pulsonic 9585 over the 9595 because there are only two differences:    - LED indicators instead of LCD indicator  - no fast cleaning mode    These didn&#x27;t really seem to be worth even the few extra dollars for the 9595.    The shaver, now I got used to it, really gives me an exceptionally close shave. Before, I used to let my beard grow for a week sometimes, but now I actually look forward to shaving, even on weekends (hint for women who would like their men to shave more often: get them this product!).    Having said that, it did take some time to get used to, especially the trimmer, which is located a bit awkwardly. Otherwise, it is a superb product, easy to grip, and feels very nice and solid.    The battery, once charged, lasts about ten days, if I shave every day. The shaver runs at full speed for the whole time, it slows down just in the last seconds before the battery is completely empty - this is really nice. Some other shavers I had before were slowing down way earlier.    In order to conserve the battery and the cleaning fluid, I decided to charge the shaver and use the \\&quot;clean &amp; renew\\&quot; feature only when the battery is completely empty. In between, I just clean the razor under running water.    While it says in the manual that the alcohol in the cleaning cartridge will evaporate within 8 weeks, whether you use it or not, you just need to take the cartridge out of the cleaning unit and reseal it.    I might even try refilling the cartridges, maybe a \\&quot;recipe\\&quot; for the cleaning fluid can be found somewhere on the Internet.</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;ve shaved with a razor since I started shaving over ten years ago.  The hair on my face is thick like tree trunks and grows in every direction (especially on my neck).  If I shave more than two days in a row I&#x27;m a bloody mess.  [no matter how \\&quot;advanced\\&quot; or new the razor or cream/jell is] I dread shaving, but I have to do it every day due to the job I have.  This Christmas my Fiance bought this shaver for me.  I had never used electric before and was excited and optimistic.      After three weeks of use, I&#x27;m impressed.  You cannot expect it to shave as close as going against the grain with a razor.  But that&#x27;s the trade-off for not shaving the top layer of your face off. However, I would say that it cuts closer than using a razor with the grain. So that&#x27;s close enough to get me through a 8-12 hour day.      I have no idea if it cuts closer/better than any other shaver, because this is my first one.  However, I&#x27;m happy that I&#x27;m not bleeding and the clean-up could not be easier.  It is true that the cleaner is noisy.  But if you are anything like me, you shave and then leave the house.  So it&#x27;s totally worth it for me.      It does have trouble picking up some of my hairs in/around my Adam&#x27;s apple and other troublesome areas of my neck/chin.  But I had problems in those areas with the razor and at least with this shaver my skin might get red with minor irritation but not gushing with blood.      In conclusion, this shaver works well for me.  I&#x27;d rather give up a little bit of closeness for comfort and convenience.</li>
    <li> I read the user reviews, (1 star through the 5 star)and after approximately a month of usage I concur with those who rated this Braun shaver as excellent. It provides the best shave I have ever had. I give it 4 instead of 5 stars because it is not great on the neck area and requires several passes to get the stubble to an acceptable condition. Even in this area it still produces a better shave than the Norelcos or Remingtons I have used over the years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble with electric shavers getting close enough.  This razor is by far the best I have ever used - approaching a blade razor</li>
    <li> Perhaps the raxor is too complicated for me to be doing everything with it to its maximum but, at this point, I am not fully satisfied with it.  My older razor takes a little longer to use but I am more pleased with the result.</li>
    <li> My husband has loved his that he received for a birthday present. Would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> My husbands comments were:  There is no perfect shaver out there, this one is as close as it gets...I have to use a straight razor by my ears because I can&#x27;t get around that area.  I love how clean it is...the cleaning system is great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had an old braun shaver for 17 years - amazing, but it still works, and I still love it.      Decided to replace it just because I thought it was time to treat myself to a new one.  Read the reviews - this Braun seemed to be the latest and the greatest - so I bought one.    First thing I noticed - you can no longer simply remove the screen to clean the blade - the only way to clean it now is to use the GIANT base in the cleaning mode to clean the shaver.  Next - the head is now made of flimsy plastic - clearly made to be replaceable - another consumable part.    So now, I have to buy cleaning fluid replacement cartridges as well as replacement heads - as if I had nothing better to do but buy parts for an electric razor.    My old Braun needed NO parts replaced for the first 10 years of ownership - then I changed the screen and blade - and never changed anything again.    Now - for the side by side comparison - the new Pulsonic vs. my 17 year old Braun - half my face with one, the other half with the other.  My wife was the judge ..... the verdict - the old unit.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  so I went back and tried to shave extra hard with the new unit - but again, it could not shave as close as the old one - maybe its all the pulsing its doing?    So here&#x27;s the bottom line - Braun seems to have converted its electric razor division to a consumable parts model - the razor is meant to constantly have parts needing replacement, while providing an inferior shave.    The company chose to focus on making more from selling parts rather than focusing its energy on making a superior electric razor.    I&#x27;m very disappointed, and will be switching from Braun after close to 20 years of use.    Too bad.</li>
    <li> I have never had such a close shave, so quickly. Within 2 or 3 shaves, my face was used to this phenomenal razor and the shaves have been nearly perfect since. It gets a very close shave, without having to labor over the same spots over and over again. It also is easy to handle, and cleans easily. Great product and worth the money, even if it does seem a bit high.</li>
    <li> I have never been able to shave with an electric razor until this one. The quality and performance of this product is incredible. If you are looking for the very best in electric razor, then look no further.</li>
    <li> Four years, two deployments. I&#x27;ve been using Brauns since I started shaving as a teen. I&#x27;m in the military, so this gets used practically every day. The shave meets the standard I&#x27;m required to maintain. The base station keeps it clean and the unit still will run for 3-5 days on a single charge even with the original battery. I did have the motor replaced out of warranty in year three, and that ran me around $50 with shipping from a repair shop in Nebraska. The cleaning fluid system is mildly annoying. I wish they would move towards a user-sustainable system using bottled fluid rather than the disposable (and environmentally unfriendly) cartridge system.</li>
    <li> I was sad when my old Braun from 1997 finally died recently, and I had to find a replacement.  After much research, I went with this one, and I LOVE IT.  I have to guard it from my wife, who really wants to use it shave her legs, but will keep it from her as long as possible!  Buy this if you want a product with a long battery life (twice daily shaving for a week, in between charges), and a fantastic shave every time.  The clippers also work great for sideburns.  It&#x27;s a one-stop-shop shaver.</li>
    <li> This was my first electric razor - having only used straight razors and disposable razors in the past. I have had this product for two in a half years. I use it occasionally - leaving it my car for emergency on the road shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering that this units trimmer has completely broken off and that it takes me five-ten minutes to get a clean shaven look,I have decided to give this product two stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the self-clean unit this shaver comes with, it would only work on its highest setting - never on the eco setting. This meant that I was out of solution in just two months. Needless to say I opted to clean the unit myself. I have used my dads older units in the past and can say that this unit is no better than his - the only difference is that while his blades are ten years old mine are only 2 years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly I am shocked this razor is still getting high marks - its quality is seriously lacking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for over two years now and have had no issues with it.  The screens last a long time, so I almost forget to replace the blades.  The blades and screen are integrated into one piece, so you don&#x27;t have to buy these separately.</li>
    <li> Very loud.  Shaving quality no better than the Norelco I have.  And the Norelco was half the price.  The Norelco is easier to clean and maintain the solution cleaning box that last zip and must be replace!</li>
    <li> leaks? How does a shaver leak? It puts all your shaved hair all over you as you shave, needs a better design of keeping the hair in the collection port. everything else ok-holds charge long time, close shave, does not tear up your face, just leaks is all.</li>
    <li> Best electric I&#x27;ve owned. Going 5-6 yrs strong. Good close shave, no razor burns or ingrowns. The auto cleaner eventually broke but no biggie.</li>
    <li> Bottomline: $1.35 per day for shaving**.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great shaver - best on the market.... but.....I&#x27;ve owned three of these shavers. Each product had to be disposed of after approximately one year of use for the exact same reason - the electric recharging contacts which connect the shaver to the base (cleaner)  burn out. Also - I have a tough beard but sensitive skin - I find that i must replace the shaver heads every two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost of 1 year ownership:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. $230.00  (Shaver)&lt;br /&gt;2.  228.00  (6 shaving heads@$38.00 per)&lt;br /&gt;3.  36.00  (1 year of Cleaning Solution/6 containers)&lt;br /&gt;3. Total Cost:  $494.00 for one year**.&lt;br /&gt;4. Daily cost: $1.35 per day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three stars due to expense and wearing issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Cost doesn&#x27;t include preshave or post shaving solutions.</li>
    <li> This is not my first electric shaver but is by far the best. Close shave, comfortable, and cleans itself wonderfully. I recommend this shaver to any one in the market for an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Not a bad product, but I paid full price and was dissatisfied when the trimmer which flips up broke and no longer retractors into the razor. After a little investigating, I found hundreds of reports on the Internet of this problem...&lt;br /&gt;Why wasn&#x27;t it addressed? I feel like they had years to fix this issue. I hardly ever used the trimmer either.&lt;br /&gt;Paid too much for it, I&#x27;ll just rubber band it down since I believe it&#x27;s just out of the warranty.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, new heads are 50$ per year and cleaning solution is 30-50$ per year.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a clue as to why so many negatives to this superior shaver.  I&#x27;ve owned this shaver for almost two years and it shaves as well as a blade and 2 times as fast.&lt;br /&gt;It took awhile to get adjusted to it because the initial shaves weren&#x27;t very good.. I decided to break up my face into 5 parts. The cheeks (2), the neck, the chin and upper lip. First shave up and down, then diagonally 45 degrees left and right, then across. Repeat twice on upper lip and chin. It catches every hair and gives you the best shave you&#x27;ll ever have.</li>
