      <li>I&#x27;ve received so many compliments on my complexion since I&#x27;ve started using the Tamanu Oil!</li>
      <li>This Tamanu oil works great for Psoriasis (my husband has it on his legs and this oil gives him tremendous relief!</li>
      <li>It is a nice emollient and doesn&#x27;t produce pustules while it nourishes the skin.</li>
      <li>I make my own \\&quot;rescue remedy\\</li>
      <li>and so happy to have found a source of true Madagascan tamanu oil.</li>
      <li>It absorbed beautifully into my skin with a rather milder nutty scent than the Tahitian oil.</li>
      <li>I like this product better than another companies as it&#x27;s liquid and has a glass dropper.</li>
      <li>I love the way it is packaged and</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s healthy appearance.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t fade as fast as I would have liked but good.</li>
      <li>I pulled out the dropper and found it to be a lovely amber color, like Slice of Nature&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Love this one, the nutty aroma is not as strong.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Teliaoils has comprehensive information available in their amazon description, stating where the oil comes from, how it is processed and the many uses for it.</li>

      <li>Your wait will be rewarded with the best tamanu/foraha oil available online!Tahitian oils are darker green in color and smell very strong.</li>
      <li>This oil was shipped from Greece &amp; arrived in about 3 wks - not bad!</li>
      <li>I love the way it&#x27;s not so greasy and it evaporates quickly into the skin.</li>
      <li>Great for scarring if you put it on as soon as possible after an injury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and my face feels smooth like a baby&#x27;s face.</li>
      <li>When I woke up the breakouts were all but gone and my skin was smooth.</li>
      <li>Great for scarring if you put it on as soon as possible after an injury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good product as far as I can judge.</li>
      <li>To me, this is the mark of an honest seller who cares about the product, and this is evident in everything from the quality of the product to the excellent packaging: packed with styro peanuts in a hard plastic container and wrapped securely, it arrived intact with no spillage or breakage of the glass bottle.</li>

      <li>It really works!!!</li>
      <li>After getting used to it and loving it, I returned to purchase more and found that it is \\&quot;currently unavailable\\&quot; and has been for about a month.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read that Madagascan tamanu oil (foraha) is superior to the more common Tahitian oil, so I found a fantastic one in Slice of Nature&#x27;s oils.</li>
      <li>I rub this amazing oil onto my face in circular motion daily after i wash my face.</li>
      <li>That alone was worth every cent.</li>
      <li>On dry days, I combine it with my BB cream to make it go on more smoothly, and it works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other brands, this one has a far more pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>there are some out there that mix oilive oil on top and the actual tamanu oil is sitting at the bottom!&lt;br /&gt;GREAT STUFF!!</li>
      <li>This cured my toenail fungus after all else failed!&lt;br /&gt;Tried everything for years and finally I have healthy nails with no sign of fungus.&lt;br</li>
      <li>few words about tamanu/foraha oil in general: Both Slice of Nature and Teliaoils state on their amazon descriptions that Madgascan oil is favored over Tahitian but offered no explanation as to why this is so.</li>
      <li>so this made me feel I was receiving pure Tamanu oil.</li>
      <li>Tahitian is very good, don&#x27;t get me wrong -</li>
      <li>I think the greek product may make a better carrier oil, because it&#x27;s own smell is hardly noticeable.</li>
      <li>The dropper is very sturdy as well.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used this oil often do to the intense summer heat .The</li>
      <li>Its doesnt leave you feeling greasy and it is very moisturizing while absorbing odors.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been reading so much about it</li>
      <li>I cant really estimate whether or not its assisted in the healing process after the peels.</li>
      <li>The dropper is very sturdy as well.</li>
      <li>the enclosed eye dropper is very helpful in dispensing the oil.  </li>
      <li>but there really is a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Definitely worth a few dollars more.</li>
      <li>The Tahitian oils are darker green in color and smell very strong.</li>
      <li>However, Simpler&#x27;s oil is so green and rich and full of healing \\&quot;goodness\\&quot;, it is still my number ONE choice.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Now I have read that the season in which the nuts are harvested influences the color/smell, with Springtime producing the greener, more strong-smelling oil, so it may be a fluke that the Tahitian ones I&#x27;ve tried are green whereas the Madagascan ones are amber.</li>
      <li>Both Madagascan oils that I have tried are lighter colored, tending more toward amber than green.</li>

      <li>This oil is a miracle worker as it has helped my fine lines &amp; wrinkles, old acne &amp; other scars &amp; leaves my usually dull skin with a nice glow.  </li>
      <li>But here is what I have learned from personal experience: Madagascan absorbs more readily into the skin and the scent is less pungent.</li>
      <li>But the bottle i purchased is nearly DONE.</li>
      <li>It completely cleared up my psoriasis in a matter of days.</li>
      <li>My oil shipped directly from Greece</li>
      <li>I love the Tamanu Oil, I use it everyday for my face and in between my inner thighs.</li>
      <li>It has a very light nutty smell, less pronounced compare to other brand I tried(Simpler Botanicals).  </li>
      <li>and I have no active acne</li>
      <li>/&gt;It began working within the first day for my extremely itchy rash.</li>
      <li>I used it last night, mixed with argan oil underneath my NZ Fusion Skin Clear cream</li>
      <li>I am not allergic to nuts but after using this for less than a week I started breaking out in places where I have never broken out before.</li>
      <li>i think true assessment will be after a few months of use -not right away.</li>

    <li> This cured my toenail fungus after all else failed!&lt;br /&gt;Tried everything for years and finally I have healthy nails with no sign of fungus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped from Greece which took a while...&lt;br /&gt;worth the wait!!!!</li>
    <li> This oil was shipped from Greece &amp; arrived in about 3 wks - not bad! This oil is a miracle worker as it has helped my fine lines &amp; wrinkles, old acne &amp; other scars &amp; leaves my usually dull skin with a nice glow.  I&#x27;ve received so many compliments on my complexion since I&#x27;ve started using the Tamanu Oil!</li>
    <li> I have combination acne prone skin. I purchased tamanu oil because I wanted to try something &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; to treat my acne scarring. I am not allergic to nuts but after using this for less than a week I started breaking out in places where I have never broken out before. This does clog pores at least in my case. If you are looking for something to improve acne scarring I would suggest drinking herbal tea with rosehip in it to help with acne scarring. I was doing this and I noticed improvement while I was waiting for this tamanu oil.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this oil often do to the intense summer heat .The few times I have used the Tamanu oil ,it left my face soft with a silky look with a healthier appearance. I have combination skin,which is acne prone on the oily parts.This oil didn&#x27;t aggravate or cause me to breakout. I only used two droplets.Didn&#x27;t want to overdo it and push my luck.I don&#x27;t mind the fragrance it&#x27;s a suttle nutty aroma.Doesn&#x27;t bother me.I think this oil would be beneficial for my skin during the cold winter months.Too soon to tell but I didn&#x27;t have any negative reactions after using this product.I would order this product from the same seller.My oil shipped directly from Greece so this made me feel I was receiving pure Tamanu oil.</li>
    <li> This oil has been a miracle for me. I have been suffering with topical steroid withdrawl for months.&lt;br /&gt;It began working within the first day for my extremely itchy rash. After 3 days the itch was gone! That alone was worth every cent.</li>
    <li> Took FOREVER to arrive but it was good! Didn&#x27;t fade as fast as I would have liked but good.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I love the way it&#x27;s not so greasy and it evaporates quickly into the skin. Will continue to purchase money well spent.</li>
    <li> I have rosacea (mad red face) that gets me annoyed and on top of that I have acne around my jawline with red scars + dry skin. I rub this amazing oil onto my face in circular motion daily after i wash my face. And it&#x27;s heaven to my skin. I&#x27;ve seen it has diminished the redness and I have no active acne and my face feels smooth like a baby&#x27;s face.</li>
    <li> I got this for acne scars on my face...or should I say the discoloration left from acne scars. I haven&#x27;t noticed anything yet. It is a nice emollient and doesn&#x27;t produce pustules while it nourishes the skin. Great value and arrived ahead of schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll post an update if anything actually improves, like my scars fade.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. As other reviews mention, it sort of just dissolves into the skin.

    <li> I&#x27;ve read that Madagascan tamanu oil (foraha) is superior to the more common Tahitian oil, so I found a fantastic one in Slice of Nature&#x27;s oils. After getting used to it and loving it, I returned to purchase more and found that it is \\&quot;currently unavailable\\&quot; and has been for about a month. Crestfallen, I searched and searched for another. I purchased Shea Terra tamanu because it popped up under my search for Madagascan foraha. I was disappointed; it was more like the tahitian variety I had bought from Life Force. Tahitian is very good, don&#x27;t get me wrong - but there really is a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched again and found Teliaoils foraha oil. I took a chance and settled in for the long wait (it ships from Greece) and eagerly opened the package when it arrived yesterday. I pulled out the dropper and found it to be a lovely amber color, like Slice of Nature&#x27;s. I rubbed a few drops onto the backs of my hands and wow - this oil is spectacular! It absorbed beautifully into my skin with a rather milder nutty scent than the Tahitian oil. I used it last night, mixed with argan oil underneath my NZ Fusion Skin Clear cream (I&#x27;ve had some breakouts lately). When I woke up the breakouts were all but gone and my skin was smooth. Today I used it underneath my daytime moisturizer and my skin maintained it&#x27;s healthy appearance. I am really impressed with this oil and so happy to have found a source of true Madagascan tamanu oil. I only wish now that I had ordered it in a larger size!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few words about tamanu/foraha oil in general: Both Slice of Nature and Teliaoils state on their amazon descriptions that Madgascan oil is favored over Tahitian but offered no explanation as to why this is so. I researched several websites to no avail. But here is what I have learned from personal experience: Madagascan absorbs more readily into the skin and the scent is less pungent. Both Madagascan oils that I have tried are lighter colored, tending more toward amber than green. The Tahitian oils are darker green in color and smell very strong. Now I have read that the season in which the nuts are harvested influences the color/smell, with Springtime producing the greener, more strong-smelling oil, so it may be a fluke that the Tahitian ones I&#x27;ve tried are green whereas the Madagascan ones are amber. But I do prefer the Madagascan, especially for my face as the greener ones bother my eyes. I use the green ones mixed with coconut oil as natural deodorant under my arms and on my feet. They work great for that. Both types worked great on a nasty bug bite that I got a few weeks ago which got infected. After 3 nights&#x27; use, the infection was gone and I am hard-pressed to find where the bite was now! Great for scarring if you put it on as soon as possible after an injury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teliaoils has comprehensive information available in their amazon description, stating where the oil comes from, how it is processed and the many uses for it.

    <li> I found this product online. I was looking for something to help with my psoriasis. This oil is amazing! It completely cleared up my psoriasis in a matter of days. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This Tamanu oil is shipped from Greece. It has a very light nutty smell, less pronounced compare to other brand I tried(Simpler Botanicals).  However, Simpler&#x27;s oil is so green and rich and full of healing \\&quot;goodness\\&quot;, it is still my number ONE choice.I applied it to my hand(I was stung by a wasp or a hornet yesterday. I still had some swelling and itching today). Itching and swelling dramatically reduced after few minutes. I think the greek product may make a better carrier oil, because it&#x27;s own smell is hardly noticeable.I make my own \\&quot;rescue remedy\\&quot; by mixing Tamanu oil with essential oil of Rosa Damascena - it improves my mood and helps relaxation.</li>
    <li> This Tamanu oil works great for Psoriasis (my husband has it on his legs and this oil gives him tremendous relief!</li>
    <li> I have tried other sellers/brands of Tamanu Oil.  Love this one, the nutty aroma is not as strong.  I will re-order this one.</li>
    <li> Delivery took a while but the seller was great with questions/communications. I cant really estimate whether or not its assisted in the healing process after the peels. But it does leave a temporary greasy feel on the skin after application. But eventually it melts into the skin. I personally wish i had gotten a much larger size b/c i think true assessment will be after a few months of use -not right away. But the bottle i purchased is nearly DONE. Good product as far as I can judge.</li>
    <li> I use it at night.  I have started to go to like the smell.  I alternate between other oils or combine for scar healing.  I like this product better than another companies as it&#x27;s liquid and has a glass dropper.</li>
    <li> Great Item! I&#x27;ve been reading so much about it, I decided to try it on my acne. It really works!!! It has a slight, weird, earthy smell... But you get used to it!</li>
    <li> I love the Tamanu Oil, I use it everyday for my face and in between my inner thighs. Its doesnt leave you feeling greasy and it is very moisturizing while absorbing odors. I have several people using it for multiple reasons, acne and muscle pains. Great stuff...just make sure you are getting 100% tamanu oil. there are some out there that mix oilive oil on top and the actual tamanu oil is sitting at the bottom!&lt;br /&gt;GREAT STUFF!!</li>
    <li> This product is an excellent quality of Tamanu oil.  I love the way it is packaged and the enclosed eye dropper is very helpful in dispensing the oil.  Great product!</li>
