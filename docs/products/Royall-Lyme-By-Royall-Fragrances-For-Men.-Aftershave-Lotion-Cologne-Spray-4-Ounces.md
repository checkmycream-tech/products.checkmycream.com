      <li>A wonderful and refreshing product.</li>
      <li>Very refreshing</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with them.</li>
      <li>I loved it but after running out, I&#x27;ve never been able to find it again.</li>
      <li>Nice, spicy lime scent.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for an absolute wonderful tie-in that I think puts this drink over the top, grate a bit of nutmeg and add a pinch.</li>
      <li>No fragrance was better for warm weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just not as good as genuine Royall Lyme.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been known to enjoy a good nightcap or two in my time</li>
      <li>I used to use Jean Nate&#x27; along time ago but discovered Royall Lyme which I love better.  </li>
      <li>I buy more and more through Amazon.</li>
      <li>Works better for me than the BayRhum.  </li>
      <li>All of the Royall products seem to be top quality</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m okay with that for aftershave though.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Royall Lyme is great as a stand-alone drink on ice (where the flavors are better-released) but it also mixes very well with club soda.</li>
      <li>Nowadays, its more Brooklyn than Bermuda.</li>
      <li>They bought me a bottle of Royall Lyme (better than a tee shirt).</li>
      <li>This is my fiancee&#x27;s favorite and I am so glad I found it.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve been very impressed with Royall Lyme, so much that I&#x27;m inspired to write my first review on Amazon.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s a near-overwhelming dryness but then surprising twist of smoothness that I get at the first sip.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like strong scents &amp; this powers out</li>
      <li>Packaging and shipping were fine for this.</li>
      <li>There is a reason this is cheap...</li>
      <li>An excellent way to cool down during the summer heat.</li>
      <li>I first bought it in Bermuda many years ago.  </li>
      <li>I received the product today, and smelled it side-by-side with a bottle of the original, made-in-Bermuda version.  </li>
      <li>THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon and Royall Fragrances for making my favorite lotion available.</li>
      <li>Very nice fragrance, but not much lime scent</li>
      <li>This item came quickly, as promised.  </li>
      <li>Very rich but still refreshing smell and actually found it energizing.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it because it smells great especially when paired with a lime shaving cream or soap.</li>
      <li>I was so pleased when I found it on Amazon, but I quickly realized that something is very different from the original.  </li>
      <li>This one is now my favorite so far.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Reminiscent of some kind of paradise, Royall Lyme is a terrific addition to anyone&#x27;s drink cabinet</li>
      <li>&quot; It was a smashing success</li>
      <li>This fragrance is light &amp; refreshing especially in the hot summer.  </li>
      <li>The price is right and delivery fast.[[ASIN:B000C1W53C Royall Lyme By Royall Fragrances For Men.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find Royall Lyme ever since a visit to Bermuda where I bought my first bottle.</li>
      <li>Many years ago, I brought back bottles of Royall Lyme from Bermuda for all my college friends.  </li>
      <li>Maybe someone newly exposed to the latest  Royall Lyme will like it without having the former version for comparison.</li>
      <li>and I will be ordering another bottle very soon.</li>
      <li>very nice.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Vetiver and Rugby came much</li>
      <li>more woodsy smell similar to old spice..</li>
      <li>Hey RL, just sell us a smaller bottle of the original and let US dilute it if we want.</li>
      <li>While its still a decent Lime fragrance, you are not getting the real Bermuda formula.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s never overwhelming and just gives off a warm, welcoming fragrance all day.</li>
      <li>It is a much more watered down product.</li>
      <li>What I received is exactly the same and MUCH cheaper than it was in Bermuda!</li>
      <li>My parents took me on vacation to Bermuda when I was a senior in high school.</li>
      <li>Not very strong, but the scent seems to dissipate pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been around forever and is still a very masculine, (not like the perfumey stuff coming out for men these days).</li>
      <li>I came back and read the reviews (which I should have done first) and I see that Royall Lyme is now made in America rather than Bermuda.  </li>
      <li>Everyone went crazy for the fresh citrus aroma of Lime that was so distinct and refreshing.  </li>
      <li>My past experience with Royal type products was better than this one.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not as pleasing as my old bottle that is running out.</li>
      <li>I echo those who say that it&#x27;s changed markedly.</li>
      <li>This one is old time lime smell.  </li>
      <li>lucked out and have an early 1990&#x27;s version that is made in Bermuda.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s both strong and subtle, such as the way fresh ground pepper is when it too is introduced to your palate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Still has a nice smell, but if you used the original, you&#x27;ll be sorely disappointed: it evaporates in a half hour.</li>

    <li> Ever since this product was franchised to the USA, its production quality has been weakened. It is a much more watered down product. Nowadays, its more Brooklyn than Bermuda. Caveat Emptor!</li>
    <li> Great stuff .... cooloing splash after shaving .  Should move to Bermuda where we could hopefully buy it cheaper !!</li>
    <li> A must for any dapper man.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance and Great price-normally $65.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I received the product today, and smelled it side-by-side with a bottle of the original, made-in-Bermuda version.  THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it has a brighter, one-dimensional lime scent that lacks the subtlety and complexity of the original.  There is a reason this is cheap...it&#x27;s just not as good as genuine Royall Lyme.</li>
    <li> An excellent way to cool down during the summer heat. A wonderful and refreshing product. I highly recommend it because it smells great especially when paired with a lime shaving cream or soap.</li>
    <li> Last time I got this product was in Bermuda.  This Royal Lyme come with a Spray Pump and is very very nice</li>
    <li> I were given this Aftershave at Christmas 1965 and now finally found it again. I looked for it at stores in Houston without any luck and then found it on Amazon. I buy more and more through Amazon. The price is right and delivery fast.[[ASIN:B000C1W53C Royall Lyme By Royall Fragrances For Men. Aftershave Lotion Cologne Spray 4 Ounces]]</li>
    <li> My parents took me on vacation to Bermuda when I was a senior in high school. They bought me a bottle of Royall Lyme (better than a tee shirt). Once you have smelled its scent, you&#x27;ll never forget it. Now, some 35 years later, whenever I smell this, it brings me back to Bermuda or a lazy summer afternoon in Florida. My wife loves it too!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.  My past experience with Royal type products was better than this one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been around forever and is still a very masculine, (not like the perfumey stuff coming out for men these days). It&#x27;s never overwhelming and just gives off a warm, welcoming fragrance all day.</li>
    <li> was a gift and they loved it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Back in the mid 1950&#x27;s, a yachtsman by the name of Anthony Gaade in Bermuda came up with a recipe for a body wash/lotion/aftershave based on lime oils, and he called it \\&quot;Royall Lyme.\\&quot; It was a smashing success and so he officially founded a production company for export. Several other fragrances were created like Bayrhum, Spyce, Mandarin, and Muske. Vetiver and Rugby came much later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somewhere along the line, perhaps in the late 1990&#x27;s or 2000&#x27;s, the Royall Lyme Bermuda Ltd company licensed its recipes to a firm in the USA that calls itself Royall Fragrances. It appears that the Bermuda company either ceased production or curtailed its exports, licensing it to a USA company to do the bulk of the manufacturing and settling for just royalties. This wouldn&#x27;t be so bad... if the recipe hadn&#x27;t been altered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One can only speculate why the fragrance was changed, but it is notably different. It smells \\&quot;lighter\\&quot; as if watered down. Was that done in anticipation of suiting the changing tastes of the market, or was it an effort to reduce overhead (smaller quantities of expensive ingredients) in order to increase profits? I&#x27;d venture to say the latter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lucked out and have an early 1990&#x27;s version that is made in Bermuda. It&#x27;s a terrific limey fragrance. The newer one is a shadow of its former self and I just don&#x27;t like it. Maybe someone newly exposed to the latest  Royall Lyme will like it without having the former version for comparison. But in trying to be objective, I still can&#x27;t see it. One can only hope that sales will suffer and the licensing company will try to revisit the recipe to its correct proportions.</li>
    <li> Nice, spicy lime scent. Not very strong, but the scent seems to dissipate pretty quickly. I&#x27;m okay with that for aftershave though.</li>
    <li> This is my fiancee&#x27;s favorite and I am so glad I found it. I have looked all over! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Very nice fragrance, but not much lime scent if any....more woodsy smell similar to old spice..I expected lime but not this time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying the Royall line of aftershave lotions starting with the Bay Rhum and Spyce and now the Lyme. This one is now my favorite so far.  Very refreshing and I think will be great for the summer.  I think I&#x27;ll have to order the Royall Lyme soap to go with it. All of the Royall products seem to be top quality and I&#x27;m very pleased with them.</li>
    <li> This item came quickly, as promised.  I first bought it in Bermuda many years ago.  What I received is exactly the same and MUCH cheaper than it was in Bermuda!</li>
    <li> I echo those who say that it&#x27;s changed markedly. My dad used it every day when I was a kid, and I started using it when I began shaving and dating. No fragrance was better for warm weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still has a nice smell, but if you used the original, you&#x27;ll be sorely disappointed: it evaporates in a half hour. Hey RL, just sell us a smaller bottle of the original and let US dilute it if we want.</li>
    <li> Many years ago, I brought back bottles of Royall Lyme from Bermuda for all my college friends.  Everyone went crazy for the fresh citrus aroma of Lime that was so distinct and refreshing.  I was so pleased when I found it on Amazon, but I quickly realized that something is very different from the original.  I came back and read the reviews (which I should have done first) and I see that Royall Lyme is now made in America rather than Bermuda.  While its still a decent Lime fragrance, you are not getting the real Bermuda formula.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Very rich but still refreshing smell and actually found it energizing.  Maybe it id s form of a aroma therapy?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been known to enjoy a good nightcap or two in my time and I&#x27;ve been very impressed with Royall Lyme, so much that I&#x27;m inspired to write my first review on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a near-overwhelming dryness but then surprising twist of smoothness that I get at the first sip. I let the oils soak on my tongue and I&#x27;m immediately hit with this Bermuda-like infusion of citrus and sea breeze. It&#x27;s both strong and subtle, such as the way fresh ground pepper is when it too is introduced to your palate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Royall Lyme is great as a stand-alone drink on ice (where the flavors are better-released) but it also mixes very well with club soda. You can obviously garnish it with a lime or even a lemon. If you&#x27;re looking for an absolute wonderful tie-in that I think puts this drink over the top, grate a bit of nutmeg and add a pinch. Stir well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reminiscent of some kind of paradise, Royall Lyme is a terrific addition to anyone&#x27;s drink cabinet and I will be ordering another bottle very soon. In fact, if there is anything negative I can say about this product, it&#x27;s that I can&#x27;t seem to find it in a larger, standard 750ml bottle or something comparable to it&#x27;s competitors on the market...</li>
    <li> This one is old time lime smell.  Works better for me than the BayRhum.  I would buy this one over the bayrhum.</li>
    <li> Packaging and shipping were fine for this. However, when I used it, the scent was slightly different than what I was expecting. In reviewing the packaging, I noted that this was produced in the US rather than in Bermuda. Don&#x27;t know if all of it is now done here but it&#x27;s not as pleasing as my old bottle that is running out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find Royall Lyme ever since a visit to Bermuda where I bought my first bottle. I loved it but after running out, I&#x27;ve never been able to find it again. Thanks Amazon and Royall Fragrances for making my favorite lotion available.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is light &amp; refreshing especially in the hot summer.  Can be used by both men &amp; woman.  I used to use Jean Nate&#x27; along time ago but discovered Royall Lyme which I love better.  I don&#x27;t like strong scents &amp; this powers out very nice.&lt;br /&gt;This product  is NEVER discounted in stores so check Amazon for the best pricing.</li>
