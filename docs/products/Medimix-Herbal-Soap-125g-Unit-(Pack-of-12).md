<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> we have used this soap for at least 5 years. It works on rashes, pimples any type of skin irritation. It lathers up quickly and each bar lasts 2-3 weeks of daily use.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the smell of these soaps and how it cleared up facial acne I had!  I am now addicted to them!!! Absolutely love the smell!! Oh wait I did already say that!!! :)</li>
    <li> My fiance LOVES this stuff.  He bought a bar at a farmers market and became addicted.  I purchase it now in large lots on Amazon, so he always has a stash.  I have read reviews where people say it smells too medicinal and I simply DO NOT understand this, but to each his own.  We believe the soap smells natural and clean.  The scent actually travels down the hall when either of us is in the shower, making the house smell as if it too has gotten a bath.  The smell does not linger on the skin though, so for all you guys out there, don&#x27;t worry.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;I should probably mention that my fiance purchased this out of desperation because he has some kind of skin sensitivity that the dermatologist is unable to diagnose.  Medimix is the only soap he has found that keeps his skin rash at bay.</li>
    <li> I use this soap regularly, and when I do not I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful soap. I keep it as an occasional treat. I would use it all of the time, but it tends to dry out my skin with prolonged usage. It&#x27;s so refreshing in the summer time.</li>
    <li> This brand of Medimix soaps are really wonderful for your skin. This soap contains 18 herbs to heal your skin. Medimix has other selections of soaps which all work well and I use them all too. Awesome product. Take care and stay safe.</li>
    <li> To start with, the soap smells terrible. I bought it because I have sensitive skin and thought I won&#x27;t go wrong with with all natural herbal soap.  I was wrong! It is not a big investment so I am tossing it away.</li>
    <li> This herbal soap is wonderful. I love the smell and the silky way it makes my skin feel. If you are having any breakout problems this helps a lot. It can be a little drying so you don&#x27;t have to overuse. If you have been exposed to any buggy areas while gardening or plants that irritate you this soap works great on any inflammation. Love it and give it away to friends as gifts![[ASIN:B001G7PZAG Medimix Ayurvedic Herbal Soap with 18 Herbs 125g Unit  (Pack of 12)]]</li>
