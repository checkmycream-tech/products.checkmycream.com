      <li>this one is a nice treatment to do once or twice a week, and each packet can be used for 2 treatments, maybe more if you have shorter hair.</li>
      <li>but this product is more like a slippery gel.</li>
      <li>You just need to make sure you wash it all out or</li>

      <li>I am always asked by my girlfriends how my hair is so healthy after bleaching every three months</li>

      <li>Daughters&#x27; love this.  </li>
      <li>Been using for years love it</li>
      <li>I LOVE the smell and how shiny and strong</li>
      <li>Very good deep conditioner</li>
      <li>but it is a strong perfumed smell, probably because they&#x27;re trying to cover up the placenta and henna.  </li>
      <li>On a side note, it is so cheap</li>
      <li>Glad to be able to buy a whole pack at Amazon.</li>
      <li>Great deal on the price via amazon since I have seen these masks go for much more in stores and on other websites.</li>

      <li>By morning, the results are worth it.</li>
      <li>All in all, though, definitely the best deep conditioning treatment I&#x27;ve tried thus far.</li>
      <li>Great treatment to use after some heavy bleaching!</li>
      <li>I have a feeling that if I left this on for 30 minutes I might see more of a difference.</li>
      <li>I only used one packet but it seems like it is just as good as the regular.</li>
      <li>This is typically designed for people that intend on selling the product in their own store.  </li>
      <li>It is the only thing that helps my fine, straight, color damaged hair.</li>
      <li>Just tried this for the first time and I have to say I highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>But doesn&#x27;t really help with detangling</li>
      <li>I highly recommend both!</li>
      <li>My hair is so long and strong.</li>
      <li>I have long, fine, straight hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep you posted after I use a few more.</li>
      <li>I just found my new staple.</li>
      <li>Use and thank me later ;)</li>
      <li>I tried it, left it on there (by accident) for about 30 minutes the first time, when I rinsed it out</li>
      <li>They have FL long blonde, fine, sun and pool damaged hair.  </li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and exactly as expected.</li>
      <li>It makes your hair soft and shinny.</li>
      <li>I have pretty long hair</li>
      <li>The last time I colored my hair it really got fried.</li>
      <li>Made my hair stronger, and it leaves it soft.</li>
      <li>My hair is moisturized, soft, and easier to \\&quot;tame\\&quot; after using.</li>
      <li>This is the first conditioner that I have used that does not make my hair feel dry after use.</li>
      <li>After using this product and leaving it on for ten minutes my hair still felt rough but looked super glossy.</li>
      <li>We are both natural African Americans, with 4a-4b hair</li>
      <li>and I can spread out half a packet over my whole head.</li>

    <li> I ordered this for my two daughters and myself. Its worked so good that and oldest daughter cries to use it everyday. It makes your hair soft and shinny. I will be ordering more very soon.</li>
    <li> Made my hair stronger, and it leaves it soft. But doesn&#x27;t really help with detangling</li>
    <li> Been using for years love it</li>
    <li> Very good deep conditioner</li>
    <li> I have been a huge fan of the original but I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. I only used one packet but it seems like it is just as good as the regular. I&#x27;ll keep you posted after I use a few more.</li>
    <li> I am not sure what all the hype is about - didn&#x27;t do for me what friends of mine claim or what some people have written.  Not everything works for everyone, so I was out of luck with this product. Great deal on the price via amazon since I have seen these masks go for much more in stores and on other websites. I prefer traditional henna (even though it smells horrible) to this mask.</li>
    <li> I love it! I use a pack every week for deep conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;I love the price for this bulk, way cheaper than buying it at the store.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and exactly as expected. No magic yet, but I&#x27;m holding out hope.</li>
    <li> Great product, great delivery!</li>
    <li> Excellent hair product!  My daughter will actually comb and brush her hair by herself now!</li>
    <li> I was recommended by a friend to try this product because she raved about how she loved it.  We are both natural African Americans, with 4a-4b hair and I must say, this product is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!! I just found my new staple. This is the first conditioner that I have used that does not make my hair feel dry after use. My hair is moisturized, soft, and easier to \\&quot;tame\\&quot; after using. I would definitely recommend it to anyone, but specifically to naturals that have such a hard time finding a moisturizing conditioner. I only wish they made this product in bottle sizes as well. This is typically designed for people that intend on selling the product in their own store.  I haven&#x27;t come across henna and placenta in a bottle yet, so I will continue to be on the look out for that.</li>
    <li> I love all the hask placenta products! this one is a nice treatment to do once or twice a week, and each packet can be used for 2 treatments, maybe more if you have shorter hair. I have pretty long hair and I can spread out half a packet over my whole head. I also use this with the hask placenta leave-in spray treatment (the pink extra strength one). I highly recommend both!</li>
    <li> Great treatment to use after some heavy bleaching!</li>
    <li> My &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; restoration effort to dry hair. Perfect!</li>
    <li> I used Henna two months ago for the first time in my hair has been wonderful so I bought this because I just want to try all Henna products now but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet so can&#x27;t say but it arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair thicker and shiny. Glad to be able to buy a whole pack at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Daughters&#x27; love this.  They have FL long blonde, fine, sun and pool damaged hair.  This product is the best.  It&#x27;ll deep condition where you can literally see and feel the results after one use.  We do not apply heat to this product, we just leave it in overnight.  By morning, the results are worth it.</li>
    <li> The last time I colored my hair it really got fried. For some reason none of my regular conditioners are making a difference. Basically I&#x27;m dealing with hair that feels like straw. So I looked around for a good treatment conditioner and found this. Now the henna in this product does not color your hair it just makes it super shiny. The placenta in this product comes from sheep and neither the mother sheep nor the lamb are hurt in any way. I don&#x27;t know how they process the placenta but this product is more like a slippery gel. After using this product and leaving it on for ten minutes my hair still felt rough but looked super glossy. On normal hair this probably works a lot better. I have a feeling that if I left this on for 30 minutes I might see more of a difference. That is what I&#x27;ll try next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> Just tried this for the first time and I have to say I highly recommend it.  I&#x27;ve used other very expensive deep-conditioning treatments and they didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair.  After using this once, my hair is noticeably shinier, but not greasy shiny which is the drawback I&#x27;ve run into using coconut oil and the like.  The one drawback is I wouldn&#x27;t say this made my hair soft, if anything it made my hair stiff.  Maybe it&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t get it all out when I rinsed or something?  Also the scent is overkill.  It&#x27;s not that it smells bad but it is a strong perfumed smell, probably because they&#x27;re trying to cover up the placenta and henna.  All in all, though, definitely the best deep conditioning treatment I&#x27;ve tried thus far.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell enough people about this product. You usually find in the African American hair section. I am Caucasian and I have long hair and constantly look for ways to condition my hair for maximum growth. I started to use this a year ago and will NEVER try anything else. I use every other week and leave it in for a hour. If I don&#x27;t have enough time I will apply and sit under a hair drying for 30 minutes. You just need to make sure you wash it all out or your hair will have a film on it. I LOVE the smell and how shiny and strong my hair feels after use. My hair is so long and strong. I am always asked by my girlfriends how my hair is so healthy after bleaching every three months and I praise this product. At Xmas I made goodie bags for all my besties and included this in it. A+ product and I recommend to any and every hair type. On a side note, it is so cheap and you can use two times! Use and thank me later ;)</li>
    <li> Have used for years, and love this clear henna product!</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner. It is the only thing that helps my fine, straight, color damaged hair. It puts back some of the protein that is stripped while coloring, otherwise my hair would be lifeless.</li>
    <li> GREAT BUY!  And it works!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this hair treatment! I have long, fine, straight hair so when a friend with really long, thick hair recommended it I was skeptical that this could work on my hair as well as it did hers without making it super oily and lifeless like most deep conditioners do. I tried it, left it on there (by accident) for about 30 minutes the first time, when I rinsed it out it left my hair feeling bouncy and renewed! It smells really good and the henna did not color my hair at all. My only negative comment for this review has nothing to do with the product itself, rather the price. Buying in bulk you are supposed to usually save but you get 12 packs here for almost $20- where I purchase my individual packets at, if I were to purchase a box of 12 it would cost less than $12.</li>
