<ol>
      <li>Best lotion for faces I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>

      <li>This is amazing!  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;m so very pleased.</li>
      <li>I use it mostly every night!</li>
      <li>This is an amazing moisturizer/redness serum.  </li>
      <li>It kind of acts like a primer.</li>
      <li>It works well beneath makeup and on its own in the warmer months.</li>
      <li>This serum got good reviews on online beauty blogs, but honestly, I think the $7.99 Boots anti-redness serum you can buy at Target does a better job.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a year.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Maybe needs more time, but won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product</li>
      <li>Love this-</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!  </li>
      <li>This product works well if you have a moisturizer or something else to go on top of it.</li>
      <li>and it makes a huge difference.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling and blends in smoothly.</li>
      <li>I am going to keep appling the Anti Redness Serum, on my face, lightly, twice a day.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>Was really hoping for something more...</li>
      <li>tremendous help in moisturizing and staying ahead of the &#x27;time clock.&#x27;  </li>
      <li>I originally didn&#x27;t write a full review for this, just gave it a 5 star, since it seemed to help the first time I used it.  </li>
      <li>and I  saw the results after very first use.</li>
      <li>Used it to calm itchy irritation on arms.</li>
      <li>But after giving it a chance to subside, my skin felt ANYTHING BUT CALM.</li>
      <li>although product said OK for sensitive skin, DON&#x27;T USE IT IF YOU&#x27;RE SENSITIVE!!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It goes on first thing after shower or face wash</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive, fair skin and get red and blotchy - particularly during the winter months.  </li>
      <li>Feels nice and absorbs quickly into the skin, but I don&#x27;t think it does much to tone down redness.</li>
      <li>I feel like my skin was super sensitive for about 24 hours.</li>
      <li>My skin felt irritated, abused, and had become red in areas that are normally fine.</li>
      <li>I read the bottle to make sure it was definitely the right product and literally I was experiencing the exact opposite of  what the bottle promised.</li>
      <li>I was going to order this on Sephora&#x27;s website but it was SOOO much cheaper on here.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.....not much help.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this soothing potion!  </li>
      <li>This particular product is no exception to all of the products this manufacture makes.</li>
      <li>My sensitive skin loves it and it really seems to help with my rosacea.</li>
      <li>think it does help with the redness on my face, which is normally from acne or irritation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It heals the breakout and prevent new one from coming.  </li>
      <li>Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t blame this product because I admit to having very sensitive skin w sebborrheic dermatitis</li>
      <li>Having lived in Hawaii for ten years, my skin is basically \\&quot;shot!\\&quot;  The dryness and aging has been accelerated and although I&#x27;m not going to change that, First Aid beauty products are</li>
      <li>Redness is completely gone within minutes!</li>
      <li>My face is almost clear.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a sensitive red-head type and</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin, use with caution.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have rosacea but have pale skin that flushes easily and shows every blemish as flaming red.</li>
      <li>although I like other first aid beauty products this is not one of them.</li>
      <li>It tingles just slightly when I first put it on.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this- I use it as my daily moisturizer and my skin stays redness-free.</li>
    <li> I originally didn&#x27;t write a full review for this, just gave it a 5 star, since it seemed to help the first time I used it.  After having tried it off and on now since I bought it, I would not recommend this to anyone with dermatitis/seborrheic dermatitis.  My face started swelling up and I broke out in a rash.  Plus, parts of my face that hadn&#x27;t been an issue with redness, became an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sensitive skin sucks, I was just hoping for my skin to look a little less red all the freaking time.</li>
    <li> Best lotion for faces I&#x27;ve ever tried! Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling and blends in smoothly. I absolutely love this product</li>
    <li> I get a bad case of Rosacea quite often and found that this product really really really work!  And not drying.  You apply it all over your face in the morning, after washing your face, then apply your makeup.  Again at bedtime after washing your face, all over.  It heals the breakout and prevent new one from coming.  My face is almost clear.  I am going to keep appling the Anti Redness Serum, on my face, lightly, twice a day.</li>
    <li> This serum has evened out my skin tones. My complexion seems to glow. It missed 5  stars because the rosacea is still there but less. And I know rosacea is difficult to cure. I will continue use this serum. I love it.</li>
    <li> This is amazing!  Redness is completely gone within minutes!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive, fair skin and get red and blotchy - particularly during the winter months.  Nothing seemed to help.  Until I discovered the Anti Redness Serum, coupled with the Ultra Repair Cream!  It&#x27;s fantastic!  I&#x27;m so very pleased.</li>
    <li> although I like other first aid beauty products this is not one of them. I specifically purchased this to help with redness for my rosacea. It did not work....not even slightly. Then one day I was sunburned so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.....not much help.</li>
    <li> I wished all beauty product worked this well!  Reduced the puffiness around my eyes like mad.  It tingles just slightly when I first put it on.  People think I have lost weight.</li>
    <li> Having lived in Hawaii for ten years, my skin is basically \\&quot;shot!\\&quot;  The dryness and aging has been accelerated and although I&#x27;m not going to change that, First Aid beauty products are&lt;br /&gt;a tremendous help in moisturizing and staying ahead of the &#x27;time clock.&#x27;  This particular product is no exception to all of the products this manufacture makes. I was given a glowing&lt;br /&gt;recommendation from a good friend of mine and have been buying these products since.  Price is exceptional as well.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this soothing potion!  It works well beneath makeup and on its own in the warmer months. In winter it goes well under moisturizer, sunscreen whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on first thing after shower or face wash and it makes a huge difference. Been using it for years!</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing stuff! I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a year.  I had red spots on my cheeks and I  saw the results after very first use.</li>
    <li> while the serum may have slightly reduced redness, in the long run it made my skin look shiny and oily. would not recommend this for male rosacea sufferers</li>
    <li> I was going to order this on Sephora&#x27;s website but it was SOOO much cheaper on here.&lt;br /&gt;I think it does help with the redness on my face, which is normally from acne or irritation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it. I use it mostly every night!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work.  Have tried it for about a week and skin is still red.  Maybe needs more time, but won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing moisturizer/redness serum.  My sensitive skin loves it and it really seems to help with my rosacea.</li>
    <li> Feels nice and absorbs quickly into the skin, but I don&#x27;t think it does much to tone down redness. I don&#x27;t have rosacea but have pale skin that flushes easily and shows every blemish as flaming red. This serum got good reviews on online beauty blogs, but honestly, I think the $7.99 Boots anti-redness serum you can buy at Target does a better job.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything to reduce redness or make my skin feel soothed. And it smelled AWFUL!! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Bought this for redness on face, used for 2 days. My lips swelled up, blisters around mouth, headaches ensued. This sent me to Urgent Care for help. I&#x27;m a sensitive red-head type and although product said OK for sensitive skin, DON&#x27;T USE IT IF YOU&#x27;RE SENSITIVE!!  No star review from me!</li>
    <li> Used it to calm itchy irritation on arms. So far so good. A little goes a long way I guess</li>
    <li> Usually buy this at Sephora.  The only thing that calms the redness I get from fragrance allergy.</li>
    <li> This product works well if you have a moisturizer or something else to go on top of it. It kind of acts like a primer. I let it absorb for 5-10 minutes before adding anything else and it noticeably reduces redness. The only bad thing about it is the price ($34 as of 1-16-2013). The other reviewer said something about the price being \\&quot;exceptional\\&quot; but I have no idea what they were talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water (Aqua),Butylene Glycol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Pentylene Glycol,Glycerin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Carbomer, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract, Bisabolol, Panthenol, Polysorbate 20, Benzophenone-4, Caffeine, Colloidal Sulfur, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Sodium Hydroxide, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol</li>
    <li> This was recommended by someone who sells cosmetics to reduce the redness on my nose, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I used it for twice a day for 3 weeks bit saw no noticeable difference in redness (which btw is not rosacea). Was really hoping for something more...</li>
    <li> Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t blame this product because I admit to having very sensitive skin w sebborrheic dermatitis but this product was a nightmare. I initially felt a burning sensation which was probably due to the caffeine so I dismissed it. But after giving it a chance to subside, my skin felt ANYTHING BUT CALM. I read the bottle to make sure it was definitely the right product and literally I was experiencing the exact opposite of  what the bottle promised. &amp;#34;Calming&amp;#34; &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; &amp;#34;anti-redness&amp;#34; &amp;#34;aloe&amp;#34;. My skin felt irritated, abused, and had become red in areas that are normally fine. I feel like my skin was super sensitive for about 24 hours. I used it once and am terrified to give it another try. I&#x27;m so disappointed as my redness has been a grief of mine for years. If you have sensitive skin, use with caution.</li>
