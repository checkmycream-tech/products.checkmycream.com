      <li>I&#x27;m not a manicurist, but was able to use this without any problems at home to give myself a good UV manicure.</li>
      <li>Very easy to apply and protects from staining nails with gel polish</li>
      <li>I wanted to try this with my gelish colors and I still had some top it off by gelish left and the combination worked perfect!</li>

      <li>I love this Gel base coat for my Shellac and Gelish polish the best.</li>

      <li>My customers seem to like it better than other products that I have used.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>

    <li> It is small, but it works perfectlly</li>
    <li> Helps with weaker nails. Great product</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and must be used with the rest of the Axxium Soak Off Gel system. I do my own manicure to save on money so this is a great investment. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> my nail lady used this stuff so i bought a bottle for myself so i can start doing my own gel manicures at home. it&#x27;s a fantastic consistency, doesn&#x27;t get a lot of bubbles, and is great for sealing in glitter</li>
    <li> I use this product when I am working at the salon.  My customers seem to like it better than other products that I have used.</li>
    <li> The best base for troubled nails I have ever used. Sadly discontinued. Big mistake OPI. This is a pro product not for home use</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a manicurist, but was able to use this without any problems at home to give myself a good UV manicure. It gives you a long lasting, strong nail finish.</li>
    <li> Was very easy to use, it made my nails very hard.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this with my gelish colors and I still had some top it off by gelish left and the combination worked perfect! And it&#x27;s cheaper than the gelish foundation, so this is what I did.... I used this axxium gel base first on my nail, cured it with led light, painted with gelish nail color, cured it, finally  used top it off gelish top coat, cured it, wiped with alcohol, and it&#x27;s better than the salon! I will never get my nails done by anyone else but me!</li>
    <li> Very easy to apply and protects from staining nails with gel polish</li>
    <li> Axxium is always a great brand for gel nail enhancements.</li>
    <li> Works fantastic.  Wears better than my Gelish base coat and must be used as instructed with UV curing.  I do however use Gelish colors with it and no problems.&lt;br /&gt;Received as new and shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> This the gel base the nail salons use for gel/shellac nails. I do my nails at home so I ordered this product to get the salon look and that&#x27;s exactly what I got!!! I Could not be more happier w/ my purchase!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only on day 3 of my new gel manicure but it&#x27;s holding up terrifically. I just thought it would be valuable to have listed that the product does not come with a brush for application. Fortunately I had something on hand that worked, but I surely would have ordered a dedicated gel brush had I known at the time.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Wish they still sold it at cosmoproff. Last for 2 weeks or longer on my clients no chipping or breaking, I have yet to find anything I like better.</li>
    <li> Great product for my stubborn nails that don&#x27;t hold ANYTHING!</li>
    <li> I love this Gel base coat for my Shellac and Gelish polish the best. I have tried others and this works best for me.</li>
