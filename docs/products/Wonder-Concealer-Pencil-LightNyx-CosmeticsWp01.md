      <li>It&#x27;s wonderful for my waterline</li>

      <li>I use it on blemishes before putting foundation and it works great.</li>
      <li>Great for the water line and around the lips for my skin tone highlight.</li>

      <li>So many uses!!</li>
      <li>It is a very nice eye pencil.</li>

      <li>Good thing to have on hand.</li>

      <li>Good packaging.  </li>
      <li>Fabulous!  Great for under eye concealer as well.</li>
      <li>I love this eyeliner - NYX is a great company</li>
      <li>The eyeliner goes on very easy but needs to be smeared or smoothed in desirable places (otherwise appears to be to blunt and bright).</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I ordered two more!</li>
      <li>This is magic!</li>
      <li>I love this!</li>
      <li>Nice product.</li>
      <li>Nice for waterline lining.</li>
      <li>Works really nice on eyes, lips and under the eyebrows.</li>
      <li>The pencil works in one easy swipe, and that&#x27;s perfect for those of us who like quick makeup.  </li>
      <li>I also use this for lip liner and it is probably the best lip liner I&#x27;ve used by far.</li>
      <li>I love this pencil.</li>
      <li>and they all love it too.</li>
      <li>It stays and makes them look brighter and more awake.</li>
      <li>Most pencils were out of my price range.</li>
      <li>Rimmel Scandal Eyes nude eyeliner works much better</li>
      <li>So maybe I&#x27;m using it most as a concealer -</li>
      <li>Love this.  </li>
      <li>Pleased with this purchase.  </li>
      <li>and I really love how much more awake</li>
      <li>Then I tap, tap, tapped with fingertips to make it kind of melt in, then applied light foundation over it and</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Love this on my lips and on my water line to make my eyes pop</li>
      <li>I love the precision and color.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s cheaper at ulta, thats for sure.</li>
      <li>time, I think I&#x27;m going to opt for the 3 pack and just get all of the colors, because I really do love the one I got.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>, I have a fair complexion and this is just right as an eye liner to brighten eyes and to highlight around my brows.</li>
      <li>Good buy and makes my eyes look bigger brighter and stand out in a good way.</li>
      <li>I just use it in my waterline (and I love it for that) or to every so lightly highlight around my lips.</li>
      <li>The light color was a bit lighter than I was expecting, better to highlight than cover like a concealer.</li>
      <li>Soo cheap and solo useful!!</li>
      <li>They can be used for so many different things, it&#x27;s just a great buy.</li>
      <li>I like the color and the creamy texture, and the application is easy and smooth (sometimes pencil eyeliners don&#x27;t like my water line).</li>
      <li>Great coverage, glides smoothly, I will definitely purchase this again!  </li>
      <li>got it in the color Light.</li>
      <li>I bought the light shade.  </li>
      <li>I use this to brighten my waterline and inner eye area and it works great.</li>
      <li>It is smooth.</li>
      <li>This pencil is great for lining the water line of eye when you don&#x27;t want that glare in your face white line.  </li>
      <li>The product is great, but Ulta is actually cheaper.</li>
      <li>so I can say that it is a fantastic pencil.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to try this product!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Perfect for using around eyes and concealing small blemishes.</li>
      <li>Overall this was a good purchase.</li>
      <li>Not bad.</li>
      <li>I got this pencil in light, which was the right choice for my skin tone.  </li>
      <li>I bought this on the recommendation from Lucky magazine.  </li>
      <li>absolutely can&#x27;t use this color as a reverse lip liner because Light is just too light for my complexion.</li>
      <li>Since it&#x27;s a slender pencil, I like working with it much better than the other concealers I own.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very soft and smooth product and goes on easily.</li>
      <li>I was unsure of this pencil at first, but once I learned to use it, I can&#x27;t be without it!</li>
      <li>It covers freckles and works great to line the waterline or to swipe over the inner corner or to highlight the brows or even to highlight the bridge of the nose, all in a very natural looking way.  </li>
      <li>If you like off white for that, this is amazing.</li>
      <li>I do think that the Rimmel nude pencil is better as far as pigmentation, but I still use this.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes and safe for contact lens wearers too.</li>
      <li>I bought this originally to control lip color bleeding, but messing around one day, I began using this pencil to fill in lines in places on my face where I didn&#x27;t really want to see lines.  </li>
      <li>Not up to NYX&#x27;s usual &amp;#34;great products for a great price&amp;#34; standards.</li>
      <li>It goes on soft so that it is easy to blend into the skin.</li>
      <li>like this color,it&#x27;s more neutral cream than Bright stark white.</li>
      <li>Glad I ordered the Light shade, as it is a pinkish color and not stark white.  </li>
      <li>When applied to the waterline, causes watering eyes at first but dissolves with time.  </li>
      <li>Works wonders on your waterline, inner corner, to conceal a zit, reverse line your lips and more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s simply a chalky pencil that doesn&#x27;t blend easily at all.  </li>
      <li>Nice drugstore alternative to some of the more expensive brands.</li>
      <li>also really like it for defining my brows, but next time I think I&#x27;d choose Medium rather than Light for that purpose.&lt;br</li>
      <li>For the price, it really can&#x27;t be beat it.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t feel it is on really.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The eyeliner goes on very easy but needs to be smeared or smoothed in desirable places (otherwise appears to be to blunt and bright). When applied to the waterline, causes watering eyes at first but dissolves with time.  Stays on for at least 6 hours (from experience -- have not tried it beyond that duration).</li>
    <li> Nice drugstore alternative to some of the more expensive brands. You can line the waterline with this to appear wide eyed and awake and can also add it under the brow bone to add definition. Didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes and safe for contact lens wearers too.</li>
    <li> OH MY GOSH! I love this! I used it as waterline liner and it worked very well for that but it wasn&#x27;t white enough for my taste. If you like off white for that, this is amazing. It stays on all day long. I also use this for lip liner and it is probably the best lip liner I&#x27;ve used by far. It also helps because you don&#x27;t have to buy a million colors, just this one. I tried using it as concealer but I won&#x27;t do that again. I have acne and when I applied it, it opened my acne and I started bleeding. It&#x27;s not easy to blend with a brush but it works very well to pat it lightly with your finger.</li>
    <li> It is wonder! Works really nice on eyes, lips and under the eyebrows.</li>
    <li> great for lining lower lids. It really brightens up my eyes.</li>
    <li> Great for tired eyes.  Line the rim, and the red is covered!</li>
    <li> Not bad. Good thing to have on hand.</li>
    <li> I love this little pencil. I use it on my bottom waterline to make my eyes seem brighter and as a highlight on my brow bone. This is especially nice if you use it lightly along the line of your entire mouth and blend, it makes your lips seem bigger and plumper and just gives a general look of healthy youthful lips.</li>
    <li> This pencil is great when contouring and shaping eyebrows and also great to use around the lips after applying lipstick.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive eyes and also wear contacts, and this product doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes at all. This is a great natural color -- not too white but also seriously brightens!</li>
    <li> Fabulous!  Great for under eye concealer as well.</li>
    <li> This is amazing on the water line to bright the eyes I also use it on my brow bone to to highlight! Soo cheap and solo useful!!</li>
    <li> Nice for waterline lining.</li>
    <li> Pleased with this purchase.  Glad I ordered the Light shade, as it is a pinkish color and not stark white.  Looks  good on the eyes. Glides on with no effort.  Haven&#x27;t worn it out yet to comment on staying power.  Arrived on time.  Good packaging.  Would recommend purchasing.</li>
    <li> I bought this on the recommendation from Lucky magazine.  It&#x27;s just not creamy enough.  Rimmel Scandal Eyes nude eyeliner works much better</li>
    <li> This was a great product for a fair price.  Great coverage, glides smoothly, I will definitely purchase this again!  The light color was a bit lighter than I was expecting, better to highlight than cover like a concealer.</li>
    <li> so pigmented smooth and creamy!!!</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner - NYX is a great company</li>
    <li> Great for the water line and around the lips for my skin tone highlight.</li>
    <li> I use it as a concealer</li>
    <li> I bought this pencil to fill in my lower water line to help make my eyes look larger. This came highly-recommended to me for that purpose. I like the color and the creamy texture, and the application is easy and smooth (sometimes pencil eyeliners don&#x27;t like my water line). Also, it did not irritate my sensitive eyes whatsoever. Unfortunately for me, the eyeliner gets on my lower lashes when I&#x27;m applying it and looks weird and chalky. I think that may just be me misapplying it, so I&#x27;ll continue my experimenting. Would definitely recommend though!</li>
    <li> Not a big difference but does brighten eyes</li>
    <li> This pencil is great for lining the water line of eye when you don&#x27;t want that glare in your face white line.  It is perfect for that.  It brightens and opens the eye without being noticible.</li>
    <li> I got this pencil in light, which was the right choice for my skin tone.  I had planned to use it to outline my lips prior to lipstick, to prevent feathering.  What a disappointment!  It&#x27;s simply a chalky pencil that doesn&#x27;t blend easily at all.  And I see no other possible use for it at all.  I shouldn&#x27;t have wasted my money.  What I really wanted was a clear lip pencil that would keep my lipstick from bleeding.  This seemed like an alternative.  I was wrong.  Save your cash.</li>
    <li> For the price I have no complaints.  Works great on my water line for making my eyes pop.  And it works great as a spot concealer.  Would buy again</li>
    <li> I got this to use as a brow bone highlighter, right at the very edges of my brows - after applying brow gel, and I also got it to use as a reverse lipliner, and finally, to use as an eye brightener for my bottom waterline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it in the color Light. It&#x27;s wonderful for my waterline and I really love how much more awake it makes me seem if I&#x27;m feeling particularly tired. It just really opens and brightens my eyes when I&#x27;m feeling a little bit &amp;#34;blah&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like it for defining my brows, but next time I think I&#x27;d choose Medium rather than Light for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely can&#x27;t use this color as a reverse lip liner because Light is just too light for my complexion. However, it doesn&#x27;t reflect negatively on the product, because the color choice was mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time, I think I&#x27;m going to opt for the 3 pack and just get all of the colors, because I really do love the one I got. They can be used for so many different things, it&#x27;s just a great buy.</li>
    <li> This product is about average in my opinion. It does everything I want it to with little to no issues. I do think that the Rimmel nude pencil is better as far as pigmentation, but I still use this.</li>
    <li> This is a great name for the product.  I use it on blemishes before putting foundation and it works great. It also lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Great, versatile pencil. Works wonders on your waterline, inner corner, to conceal a zit, reverse line your lips and more.</li>
    <li> I bought this for an eye brightener.  About 75% hemorrages over and globs up on my lower lashes.  About 20% flakes and gets in my eyes; the resultant tears wash off anything that was left where it was supposed to be.  I can&#x27;t speak for it&#x27;s value as a concealer or lip liner but other than the price I can&#x27;t endorse this as a water line brightener.  Not up to NYX&#x27;s usual &amp;#34;great products for a great price&amp;#34; standards.</li>
    <li> I use this to brighten my waterline and inner eye area and it works great.</li>
    <li> Nice product. It is a very nice eye pencil. It is smooth. Don&#x27;t feel it is on really. Can well wrapped not broken.</li>
    <li> The color is perfect for using along water lines to make your eyes pop. It&#x27;s just not very long-lasting and it&#x27;s instantly irritating to my sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> Ehh... It&#x27;s ok. I just use it in my waterline (and I love it for that) or to every so lightly highlight around my lips. Its very difficult to blend so it doesn&#x27;t work as a concealer. And it&#x27;s cheaper at ulta, thats for sure.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to the product so I have no way to give it a favorable review.</li>
    <li> The pencil works in one easy swipe, and that&#x27;s perfect for those of us who like quick makeup.  It covers freckles and works great to line the waterline or to swipe over the inner corner or to highlight the brows or even to highlight the bridge of the nose, all in a very natural looking way.  It&#x27;s creamy and it does wonders!</li>
    <li> I was unsure of this pencil at first, but once I learned to use it, I can&#x27;t be without it! I love this pencil. It&#x27;s perfect for covering blemishes, highlighting your eyes, and reshaping your lips before liner and lipstick.</li>
    <li> This truly is a wonder pencil. So many uses!!</li>
    <li> I was really surprised by this one. I had thought &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; would be for a pale person, &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; would be for a Mediterranean, and dark would be for a really really light African descent person or a kind of dark Hispanic person. (there&#x27;s a lot of groups missing because there are so few colors and very limited undertones) What I found instead was that &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; was for porcelain paler than pale complexions. I really hope the medium is dark enough that I can use it without it looking practically neon white on my skin. I was rather surprised it was so light on me, because I don&#x27;t consider myself especially dark. I would say, in other makeup lines with tons of skin tones, I tend to be a #2 out of like 20 different colors. It was surprising to me. It does dab on well for coverup of acne, it&#x27;s very hard to use and drags for eyeliner, and it was ridiculously light to use it as a lip liner so I couldn&#x27;t test the effectiveness of it beyond the color.</li>
    <li> I bought this after having looked around forever for something like this. Most pencils were out of my price range. It&#x27;s a very soft and smooth product and goes on easily. It can be used as concealer or for your waterline. I really like it and I will definitely buy it again when I run out!</li>
    <li> I like the idea of using a pencil to highlight under my brow and my lower lid, but the ubiquitous white pencil looks obvious on me in an unattractive, tryhard way. This thing is perfect for naturally fine tuning your look. I have doubts that it works that great as concealer for blemishes or anything, but it&#x27;s perfect for cleaning up edges and looking more polished and awake.</li>
    <li> Paraben-free this is lovely as a concealer if you are very pale.</li>
    <li> The product is great, but Ulta is actually cheaper. It&#x27;s wonderful as a lip limer base or under brows.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work as a concealer for me, so the only thing&lt;br /&gt;I will use it for is an eye brightener. I will not re-purchase this in the future.</li>
    <li> I am really critical of any face/makeup products, so I was very surprised with this buy. I have very dark eye circles with little crinkles that get more pronounced during the day, so I must use a  I have always had issues of getting makeup directly in the &amp;#34;tear duct&amp;#34;, dark part without high lighten the puffy/baggy area. This pencil does the trick. I love the precision and color. I do have to use setting spray to keep it in place, but I have to use that on all the concealers I have ever used. It is a little hard, but if you warm it up on the back of your hand first, it goes on a little more smoothly. For the price, it really can&#x27;t be beat it.</li>
    <li> Love this on my lips and on my water line to make my eyes pop</li>
    <li> I use this in my water line to brighten up my eyes. It stays and makes them look brighter and more awake.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time.  Use it on my waterline to make my small eyes look bigger. Perfect color.</li>
    <li> I use this pencil frequently to cover up small blemishes, and it seems to work well. It goes on soft so that it is easy to blend into the skin. If you have very fair skin, like me, then you should get the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; shade. The pencil also functions as a nude lip liner. Overall this was a good purchase. The only problem is that I have to sharpen it a lot, so it wears down quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Cvs for $4.99&lt;br /&gt;I am medium skin tone/tan and white eyeliner on bottom water line looks bad on my dark skin.&lt;br /&gt;I like this color,it&#x27;s more neutral cream than Bright stark white. Good buy and makes my eyes look bigger brighter and stand out in a good way.</li>
    <li> Love this.  I apply it after I finish my makeup to cover any imperfections I might have missed with my foundation.  Also makes a great highlighter and great eyeliner for the waterline to give your eyes a wide-eyed, baby doll look.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for using around eyes and concealing small blemishes. I ordered two more!</li>
    <li> I bought this originally to control lip color bleeding, but messing around one day, I began using this pencil to fill in lines in places on my face where I didn&#x27;t really want to see lines.  Then I tap, tap, tapped with fingertips to make it kind of melt in, then applied light foundation over it and, bingo!  It works great.  Since it&#x27;s a slender pencil, I like working with it much better than the other concealers I own.  So maybe I&#x27;m using it most as a concealer - and I highly recommend it.  P.S.  I bought the light shade.  I&#x27;m fair haired and fair skinned.</li>
    <li> I have had this product in the past so I can say that it is a fantastic pencil.</li>
    <li> This is magic! Use it to line inner rim of eyes to make them look bigger, at inner corner of eyes to make them look wider, cover blemishes, outline lips for a non-lined but defined lip.  I always carry one in my purse. All my friends have one now because I wouldn&#x27;t shut up about how awesome it is and they all love it too.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous color, I have a fair complexion and this is just right as an eye liner to brighten eyes and to highlight around my brows. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have eye brows that were tattooed on badly.  This pencil allows me to cover them.  I use this, then set it with my powder.</li>
