<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> She has very frizzy hair.  She doesn&#x27;t use this much she says because it makes her hair break and she can use another product that works just as well without breakage.  It smells good, though.</li>
    <li> I use this with the Big Sexy Hair weather proof stuff and the combo keeps my wavy hair stick straight matter the weather.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!</li>
    <li> I did not care for this product, made my hair feel sticky and felt like it was burning it</li>
    <li> I have very thick, course hair and straightening it can be a pain but it is necessary to do almost daily. I definitely don&#x27;t want to kill my hair with the heat from my flat iron so a quality flat iron spray is very important to me. Of all of the sprays I have tried, and I have tried quite a few, this has become my favorite. It is not sticky (as some of the sprays I have tried turned out to be). It is lightweight and does not leave a residue on my hair or my flat iron. It also leaves my hair amazingly soft and manageable. All of this combined with the fact that the price of this product is not nearly as expensive as some of the high-end flat iron sprays (but works just as good if not better) it is easy to understand why this is now the spray I choose for both me and my teenage daughter.</li>
    <li> Works well with flat iron and like to use it as hairspray also.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t give the performance I had hoped for. It is OK. It does smell good.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews before I bought it, I apply a brasilian keratin to my hair and every time I flat iron my hair I use this product because it has keratin , cocoa oil with moisturize my hair. I did not notice a big difference in shiny using this product I just used to protect y hair with the flat adding more keratin and the cocoa oil. MY hair is very thin and frizz even with the brazilian keratin treatment.</li>
    <li> I have fine but dry, easily damaged hair. Other products I&#x27;ve tried tend to make it feel almost sticky, but the Organix flat iron spray gave fantastic results. No sticky feeling, silky and smooth. Smells nice. Looks less dry and more healthy. I love it.</li>
    <li> I have been getting the Peter Coppola Keratin Complex Express Blowout in the salon for about 9 months (3 treatments). I loved the results but was noticing a lot of breaking and split ends. I attributed it to the fact that I was straightening &amp; blow drying more because it really was easier to manage my hair after treatments. I also recently purchased a better flat iron that goes up to 450 so I though I likely have it turned up too high. I used to let my hair air dry because it was curly but I always had to slather tons of smoothers on it to relieve the frizz and weigh down the poof! It took way too long and too much effort to blowdry &amp; straighten. Before Express Blowout I would straighten and go a few days without washing. Now I just wash, blowdry and lightly run an iron through and it&#x27;s great all day.  So onto the review of this product. I bought this because of course anything with \\&quot;Keratin\\&quot; in it draws my attention now. Like I noted earlier I noticed more breakage in my hair so I was on the lookout for a heat protection spray. That&#x27;s when I spotted this. I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt so I gave it a try. I use keratin infused shampoos &amp; conditioners that are for color treated hair and are sulfate free made by Copolla from the salon, as well as a keratin infusion to extend the life of my Salon Keratin Complex Express Blowout. I just colored my hair and my last Salon Keratin treatment has basically all worn off and i&#x27;m due for another treatment. BUT I may just wait a little longer! This stuff made my hair SO much easier to blowdry and straighten! It has been raining here for 5 days straight so humidity is high and my hair has withstood the moisture in the air. My hair is still very smooth and soft and this product has added a lot of shine to it. I also love the smell. It&#x27;s kinda coconutty. I like sweet smelling hair products. Some people don&#x27;t. I also purchased the 30 day treatment and plan to try that out when I have time to pay attention to the application without having to rush. But I will continue to use the spray. It&#x27;s the best flat iron straightening spray I&#x27;ve ever used... and it&#x27;s been a LOT of them over the years and the price of these products (if I continue to buy them) will save me a LOT of money at the salon! I do agree with another reviewer that said... The shape of the bottle makes it difficult to spray. I may transfer it into a different easier spray bottle. I have small hands and have had a hard time with lots of bottles so I keep bottles that have an easier spray to them just for this reason. I can only give it 4 stars because I&#x27;m not sure yet if it really will protect my hair from damage or even help to permanently reverse the damage I&#x27;ve already caused. I do notice that the \\&quot;split ends\\&quot; that I have been seeing in my hair has been nearly eliminated after using this product for the last week. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a permanent repair or if it is just \\&quot;gluing\\&quot; the ends together so it&#x27;s not noticeable. Either way, I love the results!</li>
    <li> I am an African American with natural (no relaxer, no color) hair.  Just used this for the first time, and all I an say is WOW.  My hair is beautifully straight, silky and shiny, with lots of body and bounce.  Love it!  The only minus is the shape of the bottle makes it somewhat awkward to use.  But the product is absolutely fabulous!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t need serum and I don&#x27;t smoothing cream. I don&#x27;t need anything, and this product worked sooo well.    Now it only needs a little little spritz because this stuff will make your heavy but ZERO frizz. It holds the style you make with flat iron exactly, and it holds ALL day long!!!     Amazing! Better than John Frieda -moisturizing and no frizz fried crunchy ends, and not even after I washed my hair. Normally, you can seee the damage after you wash, but not with this stuff because it really protects hair from heat damage.    I&#x27;ve always been half and half on Organix products, as I think some of it is not so good, but this is buy far the best product they&#x27;ve got. It outdoes just about everything in my hoarded hair product collection.    My hair type is about 2c to 3a, as it gets more curly in the back. A few spritz and a lukewarm iron, and my curls are no where to be seen - you&#x27;d think I&#x27;m naturally straight. WOW!</li>
    <li> This hair spray has a nice coconut smell, but it doesn&#x27;t last so long just for a few minutes then it disappears. Besides, the shape of the container makes it difficult to handle at the beginning. I got 2 months ago and I don&#x27;t feel that it&#x27;s an effective protective hair spray!</li>
    <li> This flat iron spray is one of the best I&#x27;ve used so far. It leaves my hair super silky and soft. It also has a nice smell and it gives my hair a great shine. I am a product junkie and I&#x27;m always on the look out for the next best thing but this will become a staple/must have. I&#x27;m in love!</li>
    <li> I have bought this several time and I really like how it feels and the smell is great! I will be buying this again!</li>
    <li> I found this product at a drug store and was interested in how well it would work. I&#x27;m a mixed black female with 3c/4a hair. I&#x27;m transitioning to natural so I use BKTs to manage the thick jungle of hair that I have on top of my head. My last BKT was 22 Dec 11 and I wanted this product just as a touch up.  The good: It made my hair a TINY bit more manageable for like a week.  The bad: Did not straighten my hair at all. I waited an extra 24 hours before I washed my hair, as well.  The ugly: STINKS.. SO... BAD!!! It has coconut oil and avocado oil in it and the avocado oil when blow dried then flat ironed stank to high heaven.  AND the smell was all over the place and stayed in my hair until I washed it. It was horrible. I didn&#x27;t even use that much as to not over saturate. I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to give it another try so I just tossed the rest of the bottle in the bin.  Try this product at your own risk. It&#x27;s cool if it works for you but the smell is not worth it to me.</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking that it would help keep my new growth straight while my hair is transitioning (I am African American and im trying to stop chemically relaxing my hair), but it did not really do anything for my hair type. It actually smelled like I was burning my hair when I went to straighten it with my flat iron, and it still did not manage to keep my hair straight for more than a few hours. Maybe my hair is just too curly/kinky.</li>
    <li> This made the condition of my hair even worse than what it was before. To start with, I  have chemically damaged hair. After shampoo and conditioning it after 3 days, it still smells like burnt hair. Made no improvement to the texture of my hair. Thank God I didn&#x27;t iron each strand 7 times each because I can only imagine... Regretting buying 2 bottles. :(</li>
    <li> I bought mine at wal mart, it&#x27;s cheaper there honestly. It has absolutely no formaldehyde! No formaldehyde cousins neither. I washed my hair, I put silk drops in, then the kenra platinum thickener, plus my argan oil by organix, I did the ever straight Brazilian keratin therapy spray, I flat ironed it, let me tell you, it&#x27;s way better than those Brazilian keratin blow outs. I was considering a Brazilian blow out, until I did research and found that it contains formaldehyde. Even the formaldehyde free isn&#x27;t truly formaldehyde free! It has dangerous levels of formaldehyde. * for those risking your health! OSHA, says that in Oregon they&#x27;ve had more complaints about formaldehyde in their Brazilian blow outs, it can cause cancer!* I think if I were any of these Brazilian blow out ladies! I wouldn&#x27;t of began using it! and I&#x27;d stop immediately for the sake of your health! Formaldehyde in these products including the keratin ones, the Acai ones, and the chocolate ones, all have formaldehyde and their cousins in it. I just would stick with flat ironing or getting it relaxed. I found the \\&quot; secret\\&quot; at least for me is the combo of the argan plus the kertain oil, call me crazy , but, I use both, and I can guarantee my hair is silkier shinier, and it don&#x27;t burn, stink from the treatments, or seem damaged. I wouldn&#x27;t do cadiveu, Marie teiexiera, or the keratin for blondes, defrizzing, or the defrizzing, it&#x27;s all gonna do intense damage to your hair!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Organix Brazilian flat iron spray for a couple months.  Helps while using my wonderful flat iron I also purchased through Amazon.  Looks like a small bottle but it seems to last a long time.  Love this product.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Hello!    I just bought this product today and love it very, very much! My hair is naturally straight but this product gave it amazing shine, volume, bounce and I was overjoyed when I found out it smells like the coconut milk Organix line! I can&#x27;t imagine all the compliments I&#x27;ll receive on not only how healthy my hair looks/feels/is but how fantastic and clean it smells.     My only complaint? The bottle is totally AWKWARD. My hand cannot hold the bottle and spray the nozzle at the same time without DIScomfort...I have rather tiny hands however.     A little extra: Though I am in love with my hair, I do own clip-in extensions for recreational purposes. Luxy Hair extensions to be exact (Which are completely AMAZING). This product revitalizes them and protects them from heat and makes them look and feel like I just unpackaged them. I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more. When paired with the Organix Replenishing Moroccan Argan Oil (in the blue bottle with gold cap), my hair and my clip-ins look like I just waltzed out of the salon and onto a hair runway or something ridiculously exaggerated like that.    Please try this if you want to be thrilled with your hair :)    Happy Hair Care!    -Jewel.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, being an African American with natural hair (who is not a fan of the locks and twists (to each their own)). I love my hair flat ironed at all times. This product has given me so much body. With this being my first time using the product, I already see a difference in the shine and how much more luxurious my hair is, I am amazed. I cannot wait to see how my hair looks after one month, two, five, and six! Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!</li>
    <li> I am African American and Caucasian and have long curly hair that almost hits my waist when wet but curls to just past my shoulders when dry. I had been looking up keratin treatments but at the moment do not have that much money to spend on my hair. The week before I bought this I flat ironed my hair and it took 2 hrs to do a really good job.    I saw pretty good reviews for this on Amazon.com and decided to try it. I allowed my hair to air dry and proceeded to flat iron my hair in the same manner I had the week before. After spraying on a section of my hair I slowly straightened one small section at a time. I always make sure the sections are thin enough to see through. Well when I was done I had flat super straight shiny hair!! It also only took me 45 min! Which is great because I like my hair straight but usually don&#x27;t take the time to do it. Also this morning I had 20min to go from curly to straight and did a quick flat iron job on my whole head! It&#x27;s not super flat like when I take my time but I actually got it all done which would have not even been an option for me before I bought this product. So I will be stocking up on this because stores usually stop carrying my favorite brands and I can never find them again.     This is the best flat iron product I have ever used! I also add a bit of Biosilk Serum when I&#x27;m done to weigh down my hair just a little bit..    Warning: When you spray this on and run your flat iron over the hair there is a sizzle sound and you can see fumes coming off of it. I used it first in my living room and didn&#x27;t notice any fumes but saw the \\&quot;steam\\&quot; coming off my hair. In my tiny bathroom the fumes were there enough for me to notice even with the fan on and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not the best thing for your lungs...I will only be using it in the living room from now on...</li>
    <li> What more can I say?  I love the smell, which is lucky for me because it&#x27;s very strong and transfers to my hand every time I touch my hair, which I do a lot, because it feels so silky and smooth.  I&#x27;m ordering my refill right now.  My one negative comment...I agree with others who said the bottle is an awkward shape and difficult to hold and spray.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells very nice but has TOO much alcohol! I misted on my hair and tried to flat iron and my hair immediately started sizzling! Handed it off to someone else...shame to waste a brand new full bottle 😔</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the Organix Brazilian Keratin products &amp; they do what they say.  Even if you just want your hair to look healthier after using heat styling products, you&#x27;ll love this line.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair shiny and soft and definitely complements the use of my straightener. I like the smell, but as other reviewers have said, the bottle is rather difficult to hold.</li>
    <li> i put it on my daughter her  hair and use a flat iron and work fine in her hair its a o.k. product.</li>
    <li> Smells good. Works ok.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews on hygienic products, but I just finished flat ironing my hair and thought if I could just save 1 person from making the same mistake..... I am mixed (b &amp; w) and have relaxed hair. My natural hair is thick and wavy; flat ironing is usually stress-free. I currently use the BKT anti breakage serum and love the smell and general results of that. I have been on a new kick lately with the sulfate/sodium free conditioners and shampoos and decided to give the BKT flat iron spray a try.  I sprayed a section of hair and actually had to go over it twice with the flat iron for the product to soak in and dry.  After 1/4 of my hair was complete, it looked like I hadn&#x27;t touched it. (I have a CHI iron BTW)  It was still \\&quot;kinky\\&quot; straight and had NO shine whatsoever.  Looking at the ingredients, the first one listed is WATER.  I should have known, I would have gotten the same results if I put tap in a spray bottle.  Yeah, it smells wonderful, but this isn&#x27;t a body spray. I&#x27;m really surprised at all the top reviews this received. Well, let me go wrap my hair so I can go out and get some REAL flat iron spray.</li>
    <li> I have fairly straight hair, but sometimes I&#x27;ll go over it quickly with a flatiron to smooth out any waves and give it some shine. I added this and it added a lot of shine and tamed my flyaways. I hate hair product that leaves my hair greasy or sticky, but this was lightweight. I often have problems finding this, since I have fine hair. This is a great product!</li>
    <li> This works really well! I&#x27;ve used others and this provides a nice shine to my hair. Easy to glide on with my hair straightener and it smells really nice. I&#x27;ll keep trying this out and seeing how it goes...</li>
    <li> I dont flat iron my hair very often, just too drying. But this product left my hair pretty much frizz free. I have naturally wavy hair, and this worked great to help flat iron it.</li>
    <li> I was in awe at walgreens when I spotted this entire line. First I wanted the 30 day treatment but something scared me off about it. I kept putting it in the cart, then taking it out...I looked like a freaking loon. There&#x27;s something about the BKT treatments scare me in general. So much heat being applied, a product being semi permanently bonded to my hair... it can&#x27;t be good! Also my stylist has been telling me that I should not get the BKT treatments, that really no one should. They&#x27;ve been outlawed in Canada and Italy, and the ones in this country, those that are truly formaldehyde free ... while that&#x27;s true in theory, the keratin will turn still turn to formaldehyde at 150 degrees. Every 6 weeks we have that same conversation. Yes I doubt what he tells me, it&#x27;s the formalin which turns to formaldehyde not the keratin itself. Or at least that&#x27;s what googling has taught me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK on with the Organix Ever-Straight.... I just couldn&#x27;t help myself!! My hair is so frizzy this time of year (summer is coming), regular flat iron sprays do nothing--just leave my hair straight for a few hours then the kinks and frizz starts back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I showered (I also used the shampoo/conditioner they sell), I put a bit of Its A 10 Leave in Conditioner, towel tried a bit, then sprayed this stuff all over and combed it through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well well well... even with just blow drying, a bit of brushing, no hard core technique, my hair was soft, shiny, frizz free, and pretty straight. I took out the flat iron....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bam, boom, bam!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is soooo awesome. Incredibly smooth and soft. No frizz. And maybe it&#x27;s just my hair type (2b/c), but this lasted 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My anti-BKT stylist was not happy I did this. According to him I still created a bond to my hair with the keratin in this product. Even with shampooing (especially with these conditioners and shampoos) I am continuing to deposit keratin onto my hair and with the heat from the blow dryer and iron I am reactivating what he calls the formaldehyde effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He compares these treatments to getting your nails done with acrylic. The acrylic will bond to your nails and at a certain point your nails just can&#x27;t take it anymore and start breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe he&#x27;s right?? It sounds logical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pft... I&#x27;m still giving the product 5 stars. I will proceed with caution and only use it once a week max. I bet if you get it you&#x27;ll love it, if you&#x27;re a BKT nut you will probably love it to.e formaldehyde effect.     He compares these treatments to getting your nails done with acrylic.

    <li> The product may be great - but the bottle is very uncomfortable to use. Hard to hold and push down the plunger.  And the plunger is really stiff. Plus - the directions say to &amp;#34;mist&amp;#34; each section of hair, but what is actually spraying out of the bottle is a gloppy spray. I hear my hair sizzling as I run the flat iron through it. Probably not the best thing. I may try pouring the contents into a more user-friendly bottle with a nice squeeze pump sprayer that will ensure a fine mist. But should I have to do that? No. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> worked ok, makes hair slightly greasy.</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT GOES ON THE HAIR SO GREAT AND IT FLAT IRONS SO NICELY. I DID MY HAIR ONE TIME AND IT CAME OUT SO STRONG AND STRAIGHT.</li>
    <li> (From [...])I stalked this product for months then I finally got the chance to buy it when the store I bought it in put it on sale and allowed me to use a coupon. So what do I think about it? Well, in the words of Whitney Houston \\&quot;hell-to-tha-naw!\\&quot; So my verdict is a resounding NO! Rich in \\&quot;Brazilian cocoa nut oil, rich keratin proteins, avocado oil and cocoa butter\\&quot; - um really? It&#x27;s definitely rich in something and that&#x27;s A-L-C-O-H-O-L. This so-called heat protectant fried my hair badly even though I used a super-low setting on my ceramic tourmaline flat iron (under 200 degrees).     I went through each section of hair ONE TIME with my flat iron and the results were super-duper straight hair. The product smells heavenly when it&#x27;s in the bottle, so good that you forget you&#x27;re dealing with tons of alcohol (my bad). Granted, I had lots of movement in my hair and it even felt silky to the touch but the thing I noticed more than super-straight silky hair was the smell of BURNT HAIR. I immediately wanted to shampoo and deep condition afterwards but I held off for two more days. So for three days, my hair smelled like a pot that caught fire on a stove with a sprinkle of coconut oil. It was awful.   Day 2 I noticed my hair didn&#x27;t feel silky anymore but rough. Day 3 I noticed more split ends than I&#x27;ve ever seen on my hair strands. I was in a state of...well, let&#x27;s just leave it at I was in a state. A couple of hot oil treatments, reconstructors and deep conditioning treatments and a very sad Search &amp; Destroy later, my answer remains the same. NO TO THIS PRODUCT. Two thumbs down, 8 fingers, 2 big toes and 8 toes!!!!    If you&#x27;ve already bought this product and can&#x27;t return it, then put in some extensions and use it on that (unless you actually care about your hair extensions). If you can&#x27;t do that, give it to someone you really don&#x27;t like or to someone who cares NOTHING about the health of their hair. Honestly, I expected more from Organix.</li>
    <li> Great spray if you like straight hair...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worked pretty well; it&#x27;s not a miracle spray but it does make my hair feel softer when I use it during flat ironing. I have African American hair with a looser curl, so people with a softer texture will likely see even better results. As far as shine is concerned, my hair didn&#x27;t really look that much shinier. Overall, I still like it and would likely buy it again just because it made my hair feel nice and soft and not stiff and crunchy after straightening it.</li>
    <li> ITS OK IVE HAD BETTER</li>
    <li> This product smells so yummy, you&#x27;re going to have to fight the urge to spray it on your toast in the morning ;-)</li>
    <li> It smells great, and it does seem to help my hair feel softer and healthier.  For the price, it is a good product.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Glad to find this on Amazon as I was unable to find it in my local stores.  Love this flat iron spray.  I have straight, fine hair and it does not weigh it down.  :D</li>
    <li> Is nice to know that your hair is being protected and also has a delicious coconut smell, and actually in real life the product is bigger so definitely one f my best purchases EVER!</li>
    <li> Love this, leaves my hair soft and smooth; not oily.</li>
    <li> Love using this product right before my hair straightener, and a few spritzes when I am finished.  It keeps the hair smooth and sleek.</li>
    <li> I used this product twice and my hair feels like it is in the worst condition that I can remember.  Do not buy-do not use....run from this product.  Smells good and that is it....it is a hair destroyer.  2nd ingredient is alcohol which dries hair out.  Back to using my old favorite Redkin Smooth Down.</li>
    <li> It smells so good, like coconuts!  And it actually sprays, not spurts in oil globs out.  Makes your hair smoother, shinier and looks and feels softer.</li>
    <li> I have to start off by saying I NEVER write a review for a product even if I love it but this hair product is AMAZING!!! I&#x27;ve tried just about everything to keep my hair straight and was very skeptical about this at first. My hair is very thick, wavy, and frizzy naturally and it takes me about an hour and a half to blow dry and straighten it. I used this and it only took me about half an hour to do my hair. Not only did it cut down my styling time but I have NO fly always at all! And it smells great and left my hair feeling soft, not dried out like it normally does after I do it. THIS IS A MUST TRY!!!</li>
    <li> You know those old fashioned pens with the coiled spring mechanism to expose the point?  That describes the size of my &#x27;coils&#x27; almost to the letter prior to my treatment with this product.  After my keratin treatment, my coils lost their frizz and increased in size....so coils turned to curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the process is tedious.  And you should definitely do it in a well ventilated area so you&#x27;re not breathing in fumes.  And don&#x27;t SKIMP on the flat iron heat, 425 sounds like alot but I guess its really not.  And the keratin product in your hair protects it from the heat.  Be sure to part your hair in small sections and do the 5-6 passes on each section with your flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve watched some You-tubers who skimped on the heat and number of passes and their results were not impressive.  Also, waiting the 48 hours before washing this stuff out is torturous.  I co-wash at least 3 times a week, so its hard for me to take the sticky, coated feeling that one has to endure while the product works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is easier to manage and is more versatile.  Braid outs, twist outs etc. always turned out with frizzy ends before...as B.B. King might say, \\&quot;The FRIZZ is gone, the frizz is gone away\\&quot;.  LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend that you give your hair a trim (since you&#x27;re blowing it dry and flat ironing it anyway) after the keratin treatment, its the perfect time.  So I trimmed off about a half inch all the way around.  I don&#x27;t believe in that hunt and snip mess people are talking about.  If you&#x27;re going to trim your hair, trim it so that its EVEN all the way around.  But I digress.  This product is FABULOUS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and I did it April 23, 2012 (Its supposed to be a 30 day treatment), today is June 17 and I&#x27;m still reaping the benefits of the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Major Benefits&lt;br /&gt;-Exceptional reduction is breakage&lt;br /&gt;-Makes braid outs a breeze&lt;br /&gt;-Hair feels smoother and silkier&lt;br /&gt;-Looser curls&lt;br /&gt;-Handling, styling, braiding is so much simpler&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE MORE VERY IMPORTANT THING&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer mentioned that one bottle of Brazilian Keratin Smoothing Treatment was enough for her and two of her friends, I&#x27;m not sure how she pulled that off.  My hair is about 9 inches long all the way around.  I was JUST able to complete the application with one bottle.  So if your hair is longer or very thick, I&#x27;d recommend purchasing two bottles.

    <li> smells great. my hair is natural now. i used it more when my hair was relaxed but it still works fine either way.</li>
    <li> This product really works, it&#x27;s not heavy on your hair and they look smooth and silky. Nice smell too. I just love it!!</li>
    <li> I am really disappointed because I have had my eye on this product for several months. It smells fantastic, but that&#x27;s the only thing I like about it. It doesn&#x27;t add any silkiness or shine to my hair and I don&#x27;t feel like it protects from heat styling. The bottle is difficult to use with  one hand due to its shape. I will stick with my old heat protection spray that actually keeps my hair from getting damaged. Wish this lived up to the hype but it just doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff..and makes your hair smell great!!!</li>
    <li> This product is a waste of money as it does not do ANYTHING. Don&#x27;t waste you money!</li>
    <li> the smell is so heavenly. the words that come to mind when i use this spray are hawaiin tropic hazy summer sweet musky. I use it just as a defrizzer because I hardly ever use heat on my hair. it makes my hair so soft and silky and easy to brush through. it&#x27;s awesome. I would buy it just for the scent tbh.</li>
    <li> It works well for keeping my hair straight in the Texas humidity, but the coconut smell is WAY TOO STRONG.</li>
    <li> My hair looks great. Thanks to this miracle product. smells great. I have very coarse hair and now its straight and silky but not greasy.</li>
    <li> I do not work, does not give me warp brightness leaves my hair ((or even use iron)) ningunna felt no difference to use this, just use the TRESemme hair protector. Use both at the same time and only Tresemme and it was the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thin and slightly wavy, and if I did not work my much less to have thick curly hair.</li>
    <li> I like this heat protector better than the more expensive brands I have purchased in the past. My hair feels protected and I love the way it smells.</li>
    <li> Awful. Contains alcohol, which is incredibly drying for your hair, especially if you&#x27;re going to use heat on your head. 0 Stars in my book.</li>
    <li> My new FAVORITE product.  It leaves my hair SO SOFT and smells SO GOOD!  I&#x27;ve tried MANY sprays and most of them left my hair stiff... I have bleached Blonde hair and to find anything that leaves it SOFT is AMAZING!  and it&#x27;s CHEAP! Purchase it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected it was more like hair spray</li>
    <li> use on dry hair then pass over hair about 5 times with flat iron. will be straight for days. I love it</li>
    <li> i was surprised to find this product to make my hair dry and brittle since it is a type of conditioner. maybe its the alcohol ingredient? anyway, smells nice, but my hair is too dry. i have to return it.</li>
    <li> This product does work great for keeping hair healthy with hot iron and dryer use. I highly recommend it. When it comes to shampoo and conditioner, however, I would go with Pantene&#x27;s Keratin Repair over the shampoo and conditioner by Organix, which I found, conversely, to dry my hair too much.</li>
    <li> I bought this bottle of Organix Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy, Flat Iron Spray when I bought my HSI 1\\&quot; CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER w/Free 5 ml bottle of Argain Oil Leave In Hair Treatment, sold by Blue Novelties and boy am I glad I did. I have very fine hair (but lots of it) and it&#x27;s always either frizzy, really dry or just unmanageable. I use this spray in conjunction with the HSI Argain Oil &amp; Pantene&#x27;s Always Smooth Toujours Lisses (from Wal-Greens, but I don&#x27;t know if they still carry it) and my hair has never looked better. My stylist was always complaining about my dry brittle hair and that it was hard to work with and she was always suggesting I cut my hair so it stays healthy. But since I&#x27;ve been using this products (and the others) she says it&#x27;s a joy to work on my hair now. It styles easily. It&#x27;s growing at a rapid pace and most of all, since I live in Texas, it&#x27;s not frizzy anymore. I really could go without the Pantene. But I cannot live without this Organix product and the HSI Argain Oil. My hair will not curl, no matter what I do, that&#x27;s where my HSI straightener comes in. I put the products in my hair and let it dry, then I use the straightener and BOOM I have beautiful hair that takes only minutes to style and it stays put all day without frizzing or going flat. It really looks like I just stepped out of a salon! One of the reasons I bought this because it has Keratin in it. If you know anything about Keratin, it makes your hair stronger, continuously conditions and helps hair grow faster. Just make sure you really shake the bottle so you get all the benefits of ALL the sprays ingredients. Also, Brazilian Keratin Treatments at a salon cost between $150-$600, depending on your hair. Well, why spend all that money when you can have it at a very reasonable price and in a spray you can use everyday? So, I highly recommend this product if you constantly heat style your hair. I use it on a daily basis whether or not use a heating tool. And for you curly haired girls with unmanageable curls, use the Keratin Spray and the HSI Argain Oil to really get beautiful, sleek straight hair. There&#x27;s really nothing like this combo! My curly girls rave about my idea of combining the two. It really is the best you can get for your money. Don&#x27;t spend a fortune to look like a fortune!!

    <li> This is a great product. It does what is says it does. However, I am mixed with African-American/native American with natural hair. My hair stays straight after using the product with the lat iron, but it may frizz up about 4-5 days later. This product is probably better suited for silky hair.</li>
    <li> Adds a nice shine and helps with the heat on my hair. What&#x27;s not to love.</li>
    <li> This product seems costly, but it is worth the purchase.  It made my daughter&#x27;s hair smooth and silky.  She wears her hair natural, but it looked permed when she was done.  We bought the blow out stuff and will comment once we try it.  But this is a product to be repeated.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Protects hair from damage of hot irons and protects from drying out.  I have thick hair and use a fair amount of heat..my friend has finer hair and recommended it to me.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! I am blonde and most flat iron sprays make my hair look greasy. This product tames fly always without weighing my hair down. I love the smell too!</li>
    <li> I like the smell, and it does make my hair soft for the most part. And I like that it doesn&#x27;t have silicone in it. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the spray nozzle. It&#x27;s weak, hard to press, and doesn&#x27;t work well unless you have the bottle straight up 90 degrees.</li>
    <li> Finally I&#x27;ve found a flat iron spray that works! Even better, it doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune. My hair stays smooth and frizz free ALL day. Wonderful scent, too.</li>
    <li> Purchased Brazilian Keratin Flat Iron Spray to provide continuity and consistency.  Currently using other Keratin products.  It works well, does what it is suppose to do extremely well.</li>
    <li> Love this therapy treatment.  It prepares the hair for the high heat intensity of the flat iron and protects the hair from that burning smell that often happens.</li>
    <li> Not my ideal product in my quest for a good heat shield.  It&#x27;s light, cooling and dries quickly.  But even with my flat iron on the lowest setting and  just a few whisps of the flat iron to get the thickness on the underside in the back of my head under control, I&#x27;m still getting burned, course hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell good. That&#x27;s worth a few stars :)</li>
    <li> I tried 3-4 types of flat iron heat protectants.  Most worked fine but had an awful smell that over rode the shampoo etc.  This smells like coconuts.  Love it.  Also lasts into day 2!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron spray.  I don&#x27;t even use it with my flat iron, I use curlers in my hair.  Perfect hold every time!  I spritz before I curl my hair (just on the ends) and the curls last all day</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product after reading the reviews here. It smells great and adds shine to my hair. I like this better compared to few other products because of the spray on functionality and the price. I hate using the sticky foam.</li>
    <li> This product works great, but doesn&#x27;t spray evenly from the bottle.  The best way to use it is to spritz it into your hands then rub on your hair.</li>
    <li> I love Organix products and this product is a great flat iron spray.  It leaves my hair so manageable and soft. The only negative was that the spray bottle top was not tightened and it leaked a little.</li>
    <li> I have had problems getting the sides of my hair to grow for years now, it always just breaks off. I&#x27;ve tried a few different things but this seems to help a fair amount. It smells great too!!</li>
    <li> This is a good product to use with your straightener and it smells good too! I&#x27;d  definately buy this again.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, my hair has never been able to stay straight all day no matter what I do but I think this helps a little bit. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy it again but I love the smell so I don&#x27;t regret the bottle I already bought.</li>
    <li> I noticed no difference from any other flat iron spray. My hair is still frizzy in the humidity!</li>
    <li> The spray bottle doesn&#x27;t spray easily.  I might put it into another spray bottle so it comes out more easily.</li>
    <li> ** Update 3/5/15 **  I have changed my 5 star rating to a 2 star because it has been doing nothing for my hair lately, except drying it out. It&#x27;s too bad as for awhile it did work but not anymore. My hair is not in great shape anymore, just kinda drab with split ends.  I have gone back to Coppola since this works for my hair.  I have used Coppola Thermal Mist for quite a few years on my hair especially after getting a keratin treatment.  I won&#x27;t be buying that anymore since using this spray.  I love the way it sprays out, it&#x27;s a light mist so you don&#x27;t have to worry about overdoing it, it smells great, but most of all is how well it performs! It controls the frizzies....even when it&#x27;s really humid (nothing else has helped), and it looks so smooth and polished. I like to wear my wavy hair straight and this bottle does the trick!</li>
    <li> I did not think this would do anything special with my hair with all the other products that I use for heat resiliency. I do not over use with other products but it is a nice bonus every other time I straighten my hair.  It smell nice too!</li>
    <li> I have used this product along with the Flat Iron and I must say that my hair straightened and remained straight for days and was soft and manageable</li>
    <li> If nothing else, this product smells great. It seems to smooth my hair out too, so Im very satisfied overall.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m half Native American, half European. I have thick, heavy native American hair with a slight wave in some sections. I used this product after being bitterly disappointed by the 30 day treatment that seemed to bake and reinforces the waviness into my hair after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used 3/4ths of a bottle at one time on my hair. I wanted to make sure I protected it as I fought with my waves. I sprayed extra on my ends to try to protect them. It didn&#x27;t make my hair any shinier. It didn&#x27;t seem to do a thing to protect my ends. I followed it up with Garnier Sleek and Shine Leave In conditioner to help tame the frizziness it left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t seem to do anything at all other than steam burn my scalp and forehead and smell kind of good. I&#x27;m giving it a 2 because my bathroom floor is super-shiny looking, and the smell isn&#x27;t terrible. Maybe I&#x27;ll just use this with my hair dryer and a round brush to use it up and try something else after that.</li>
    <li> Even though I didn&#x27;t order off here (purchased from my local beauty&#x27;s supple store)  I read the reviews here &amp; watching it work on YouTube  and decided to try it ...I llloovvvee it leaves my hair soft and shiny . not a fan of coconut at all the smell  isn&#x27;t too bad...just a FYI it does leave your hair a Lil moist so after spraying just give it a couple seconds to dry &amp; your good to go</li>
    <li> So far I am very pleased with this spray. I used it yesterday for the first time. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy in my hair or make it feel sticky. I used it liberally as I have thick, wavy, coarse hair and needed a lot. I usually get split ends after flattening but this time I didn&#x27;t get any (or very few that I just can&#x27;t see). I blow dryed my hair section by section and flattened as I went and got a shiny, silky smooth finish!</li>
    <li> This review is based on ingredients alone. I ordered this product after reading the raving reviews. I did the big chop 6 years ago and after 3 years or trial &amp; error and another big chop, I finally have healthy, strong, waist-length hair. During this journey, I avoided heating tools, so no flat irons, crimps or curling irons allowed but i&#x27;m getting married in September on a humid beach in Dominica. Since my multiracial curls have a personality of there own, I plan on wearing my hair straight, but I didn&#x27;t want to just throw away 6 years of hard work for beauty, so I decided to look for a product that will protect my hair from heat damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product thinking it was all natural and organic, however, upon receiving this and reading the ingredients, I noticed that the second ingredient is a form of alcohol. Alcohol is not organic, it is very drying and damaging to my hair ,I learned this during the first disastrous 3 years. After making this discovery, I logged in to amazon and shipped it back.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. My hair has never looked better.</li>
    <li> I naturally have REALLY thick and curly hair so I was excited to get this in the mail and have it work like how so many people were raving about online!&lt;br /&gt;The product did not do ANYTHING for my hair!&lt;br /&gt;It actually made it harder to straighten my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I enjoyed about this product was the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase or buy this again!</li>
    <li> This product worked very well not only to protect my hair from burning while using the flat iron, I was able to get a little body added to my hair and it had a great shine to it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  I&#x27;ve tried tons of brands and they are usually sticky or I don&#x27;t like the scent or how they feel.  The scent is tropical but not overbearing, and I love how easy it is to work with!</li>
    <li> My hair is normally strong,but I had a problem with my last highlighting and it had to be somewhat undone and then redone. My hair was never in such bad shape as after that and I actually had breakage at the crown. I have keratin straigtened hair so I wanted someting that wouldn&#x27;t interfere with that. It does protect my hair-use it on dry hair before flat ironing or blow drying and it does smooth and soften. I feel as though I am conditioning instead of damaging. I only gave it 4 stars due to 2 things-First, it is pricey and the size of the bottle is not that big.Second, I see no diffference in &#x27;shine&#x27;..but that may just be because my hair is so damaged. It is a very good protectant from heat appliances. P.S. The BEST product for damage has and always will be Nexxus Emergencee. I leave it on 5 minutes after shampoo and then condition. NOTICEABLE difference. Used to use it about once a month or so but with this recent damage, I use it every shampoo-stuff is awesome. Emergencee actualy repairs, this product protects the repair!</li>
    <li> Made my hair bushier, frizzier, and thicker. After using this my hair was extremely damaged. It does not protect your hair, it will ruin your hair. I didn&#x27;t experience any of the healthy, silky looking hair.</li>
    <li> Like this product very much for flat iron styling.  It leaves my hair pin straight , shiny and frizz free.  I use it along with the shampoo and conditioner and these products have made my hair more manageable and lot less frizzy eversince!!!!!</li>
    <li> The flat iron spray itself was great, it smoothed my hair and made it shiny and soft to the touch. I flat iron my hair frequently so this type of product is ideal for me. The bottle broke within a few days of its purchase, so I poured it out into a different spray bottle.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t actually set my mind to this it is greasy the cocnut smell is overpowering but it does soothing the hair and kinda of  light wieghted product</li>
    <li> I just sucessfully flat ironed my hair for the first time with my new flat iron. And I used this spray, and it is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;I am an African American woman with extremely thick hair that requires a lot of moisture. I didn&#x27;t even have to blow dry my hair first...all I did was spray this on each small section, comb it, rake it thru my hair, and it worked like a charm. It absorbs almost completely so you don&#x27;t get that sizzle like your hair is burning. And my hair was soft and shiny and held curl! I love it.</li>
    <li> I just used the Organix \\&quot;Ever Straight\\&quot; Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray for the first time and....wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent dollars and dollars on expensive products and professional treatments. You name it, I&#x27;ve tried! BUT \\&quot;EVER STRAIGHT\\&quot; REALLY WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After drying my hair, I used the spray and ironed my hair to perfection! And it did not cost me $25 not even $250.</li>
    <li> My hair is very curly/wavy. I usually use a home straightener product on it; the kind you comb and comb and comb in. That works very well for me for three months.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I&#x27;d try this stuff. I don&#x27;t flat iron my hair. I tried something else. I spray it on after I wash my hair. Comb it and use a brush attached-hair dryer and blow it dry. I like volume and use big rollers when as my hair cools.&lt;br /&gt;My hair stays mostly curl-free all day. I am very pleased. I am thinking of giving up the chemical home straightener product. This stuff isn&#x27;t too expensive either.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, good luck using this product.</li>
    <li> I spray on dry hair before I style and after for a touch of shine.  Hair is soft with no frizz. Smells good too!</li>
    <li> my friends and i love it. now i need another because they still it from me. it made my hair much more beautiful with a shinny not grease look</li>
    <li> This is just fine for damp hair but I don&#x27;t see any sense to spray water on your hair before heat styling. And the directions say to spray on after styling. That&#x27;s plain stupid, who in there right mind would spray water on freshly straightened hair. I did!! Aside from not much it did nothing. I like the chocolate smell but it doesn&#x27;t last. Its like watered down hair spray.good for wet sets. Better off getting the 14 day keratin treatment and styling with that if you need to put something on.</li>
    <li> Leaves  my hair silky... and conditioned ....&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend for any  colored/ processed hair... ...flat iron or curler  users.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite flat iron spray. It keeps my hair sleek and frizz free for a fairly long time.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Organix Brazilian Keratin Shampoo and Conditioner for the past month.  My hair felt very soft after each washing.  I then decided to try the Ever Straight spray. You just blow dry your hair and when you are ready to flat iron, you spray it on and flat iron.  It makes your hair super straight and silky soft.  The best part is my hair does not frizz.  I have very wavy hair that does nothing but frizz especially in the summer heat and humidity.  I had seriously been considering the Kerafusion treatment at the salon, but the price was just too much for me to handle.  I can wash my hair and flat iron with this spray and go 3 days without it frizzing.  I have even been outside in 90+ heat and 70% humidity and my hair is still straight and silky soft.  I just cannot get over how well this product works.      My only gripe would be the shape of the bottle.  It&#x27;s a little awkward to use and I sometimes end up spraying all over my neck and face.  I am considering transferring it to another bottle.</li>
    <li> This makes hair so smooth. One of my favorite products. U must try - you won&#x27;t regret it. Smells amazing too.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I went this long without this product, I am african with color treated frizzy hair and I&#x27;ve had this product for months and barely used yesterday. it made my hair so straight !!!!!!! I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product always leaves my hair really soft &amp; very straight with no frizz to speak of!  . ..... Even though I have some serious split ends!</li>
    <li> I got this when I got my new straightner. It works well, but I had to use a lot, and it kind of makes my hair stiff and dirty quickly.</li>
    <li> I think it is coconut oil and water. I&#x27;m not sure if it protect my hair from heat or not.generally I was happier with bed Heat spray for flat ironing y hair</li>
    <li> when I use this spray my hair is like silk.  I also use it just when blow drying as well.</li>
    <li> this is the only thing that keep my hair straight for a long time and have my hair look lovely i will buy this  anytime love it love and it last for a long time to ;)</li>
    <li> this is good flat iron spray; smells great and works well with the flat iron; purchased for my daughter and she love it</li>
    <li> Really protects my hair from the heat of my straightener.</li>
    <li> This stuff does exactly what it says it does. It smoothes out your hair !</li>
    <li> I have kinky curly hair.  This spray worked very well.  Didn&#x27;t burn and smells good.  I would recommend</li>
    <li> I tried this because I was interested in the keratin treatments.  I loved it right away.  Since I only use baking soda and vinegar to wash and condition my hair, even when I don&#x27;t straighten my hair, the shine is more enhanced the next day, as I wash my hair at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had difficulty finding another bottle, so I tried another way more expensive brand...and it&#x27;s just not even in the same category as this one.  So I searched high and low and found another bottle.  I&#x27;ll be sticking to this one for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like straight silky hair, but not so straight that it looks ironed, so I flip my hair at the end to give a bit of bounce.  The spray leaves my hair soft and natural feeling that I now straighten my hair almost everyday.  No fly-aways, no frizzies, and it stays the way I love it until I shower again.  I never have to retouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product!</li>
    <li> I tried the Organics when I purchased my flat iron. It works great. Hair stays straight for two days.  Normaly it is fine and curly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product several times.  It doesn&#x27;t smell awful, but doesn&#x27;t smell amazing.  There is kind of a coconut scent, (which I am not a fan of).  My hair feels very soft after using the flat iron.  I guess my biggest drawback is the coconut scent.  As for hair protection, so far, so good.  I love Organix brand, and have not seen any other flat iron spray or cream, so I will likely purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> Recently tried the Palmers coconut oil formula kit from Walmart but didn&#x27;t have any follow up products like a flat iron mist or conditioner so I went fishing for these. Because of all the rave reviews on Organix I decided to get their keratin shampoo, conditioner and flat iron mist from here. It arrived it great time the packaging was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well then I used the shampoo - no complaints, used the conditioner - please with the results.....On to the flat iron mist: My first thought after the 1st spray was \\&quot;somebody screwed up and put rubbing alcohol in my bottle\\&quot;  But then sniffing the bottle I got a wif of a faint chocolate scent....Second thought: somebody in the manufacturing plant was having a drink and ended up dumping it in my bottle when the supervisor showed up. I wont taste it to verify, I&#x27;ll just stick to Chi Keratin Mist in the mean time I want my money back.</li>
    <li> I use this on my 16\\&quot; Chinese Virgin full lace unit and this flat iron spray keeps my hair looking as beautiful as the day I first got it. Unbelievably soft, shiny and silky straight. This is by far the best straightener I&#x27;ve used! It doesn&#x27;t make it greasy, it&#x27;s so light weight and gives it body. Even in the high humidity here in Alabama it keeps it looking smooth and silky all day with no frizz. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Its a great product, smell good and its easy to used,its a lil bit small but although works good in my curly hairs. I love it!!</li>
    <li> It really helps with the straightening I do on my 12 yr old daughter&#x27;s hair.  Her hair is very curly naturally and she likes the change.  Plus is smells WONDERFUL!! :)</li>
    <li> I gave a review for this product before, and it was removed so I suspect this would be removed also. I hate this product. It does straighten the hair but ask yourself what you will be giving up in order for your hair to be straight. I initially purchased this product to use on my human hair wig when I switch from curly to straight. I began using the product on my daughter&#x27;s hair. She was between relaxers and I wanted to address the new growth for an additional two weeks. Boy was this a wrong decision. I sprayed it in her hair and the first thing I smelled was fragrance and a-l-c-o-h-o-l. Too much of the latter. After at least four days, her hair was straw looking, rough feeling and the only thing that could be done was to shampooed and heavily conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does straighten the hair I can say that, but it should not be used in excess.</li>
    <li> Did not protect my hair from the heat. My hair still fizzed up in the iron and this spray left my hair extremely dry.</li>
    <li> Delivery time just as offered, the product works perfectly. Blow-dry your hair then spray it a little (you don&#x27;t need to spray too much) and then iron it, hair looks somoth shiny, straight but not heavy, love it!!</li>
    <li> I get regular brazilian blowouts, which average $150 peer treatment every 3 months. I wanted to try something cheaper. I have thick curly hair. After using the spray my hair was shiny, soft, and smelles great. I recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> great product, makes your hair feel stronger and helps the flat iron work better, I bought this for my daughter for Christmas, I recomend this product</li>
    <li> Only use this product when I want my hair to be really super straight. Gives the hair an extra shine factor.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it too much, what I don&#x27;t like is the shape of the bottle. It&#x27;s hard to hold and press down at the same time.</li>
    <li> Does wonders for my hair. Hair is soft and manageable and able to curly with no problems. Love it Love it</li>
    <li> I have chin to shoulder length wavy layered (caucasian) hair that is color processed.  Left to dry naturally, I&#x27;d get a lot of wave, especially with the layers, but I like it straight but with volume.  This product does a really nice job of helping me straighten my hair with my hair dryer without too much effort.  I use a leave in spray on conditioner first (since my hair is color processed), then spray this on (5-6 sprays all over) then comb.  Then I just dry as usual - no other product.  My hair styles noticably straighter then when I skip this product.  It smells nice, and my hair still has good volume - not that \\&quot;stuck to your head\\&quot; look I get when I use heavier product or a flat iron.  However this does NOT make my hair look/act like I had true Brazilian hair straightening.  If I let my hair air dry with this spray it would reduce my waves, but not dry pin straight.</li>
    <li> The Organix Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray is wonderful. I makes my hair so soft and makes it look like I just got out of a salon. I decided to get this product because I purchased the flat iron around Christmas time. I bought a HSI Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener for my daughter in law and it was on sale so I bought me one and with the flat iron and the spray, my hair hasn&#x27;t looked as good as its looked in a long time. I would definitely recommend both of the products 100 percent.</li>
    <li> Although this did not get rid of all of my frizz I blame that on using a straightener for years without any protecting spray. This stuff smells great though! I am not a fan of coconut usually but the scent of this is actually really good. It is more like a vanilla-y coconut than the coconut scent I am used to. My hair did feel softer as well after using this. I wouldn&#x27;t call this a miracle cure or anything for frizzy hair, but it did make it better than when I don&#x27;t use any product. I&#x27;d say give it a try! It didn&#x27;t make my hair greasy and it made it smell awesome! Great for the days where you don&#x27;t feel like washing your hair, but still want a nice smell!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my 17 year old granddaughter who uses the flat iron when she shampoos her very long and curly hair.  She loves it since her hair is much shinier after using the flat iron.</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t think this products works well as my hair feels rough and dry! I have used other products which help make my hair feel silky and this product is not one of them.</li>
    <li> I must say, I am impressed with this product. I am African American and Puerto rican, so my hair is very thick, full, and wavy. I stopped using relaxers on my hair years ago, and decided to save money by doing my own hair at home. I could never get it to be as straight as the beauty salon was able to get it until I ran across OGX Flat Iron Spray at my grocery store. I have been using their hair oil for quite some time, so I decided to give this a shot, and boy am I sure glad I did. For the first time since doing my hair at home, I was able to get it as straight as the salon does. I don&#x27;t even have any frizz in my hair because it keeps it sleek without causing any damage. After all these years, I have finally found a product line that works great with my hair texture. Even though I love my natural hair, it can be hard to manage in this Texas sun, so keeping it straight makes it easier on me. I have now started using all of OGX&#x27;s products and I am happy with the results.</li>
    <li> My hair has uneven waves and I have to blow it dry so it doesn&#x27;t look like I just rolled out of bed. With any moisture in the air (rain, humidity, snow), my hair will frizz and the waves will start to come back.  I have been using this product off and on for about a year now and it works great to keep my hair straight and frizz free.&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday I really put it to the test. I decided to use it, knowing I was going snowboarding in the afternoon.  I did my normal routine, washing my hair, drying it as straight as I can (I still don&#x27;t know how my stylist gets it so straight with just a brush and a hair dryer, I&#x27;ll never achieve his level of straightness without lots of help.)  Then, I section off my hair and spray the Ever Straight section by section and use my flat iron as I do each section.&lt;br /&gt;After 4 hours on the slopes, while it was snowing, my hair still looked straight and frizz free.  This morning, my hair still looks smooth and straight.  No bed head look at all.  Without this spray, my hair would be a mess the morning after snowboarding in the snow.  I could actually go out in public and not hide my hair under a ball cap!</li>
    <li> Product smells great and makes my hair look great. Though you never quite know if it actually is &amp;#34;defending&amp;#34; your hair from heat...</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard like some - and it smells good.</li>
    <li> The bottle is a little awkward to hold because it is a flat oval but makes my hair shiny and I don&#x27;t seem to have anymore split ends than usual.</li>
    <li> Works great you don&#x27;t need to use much</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! Leaves my hair super straight, silky and no more frizzzzzz!!! Love it!! I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Nice for any heat application. Shine, frizz control even on a rainy day.</li>
    <li> I have been using this spray every day before flat ironing. Offers great protection and smells wonderful. Much less frizz and damage has occurred for my hair.</li>
    <li> Pros This product made my hair soft and easy to brush cons it did not however make it very straight or less frizzy ..I do have curly hair but have used other flat iron sprays that help this I wanted to like it it smells nice but this is not for me</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally wavy, thick and a mess to handle. If I don&#x27;t fix my hair, it ends up looking half curly and half straight straw. I got this stuff originally a few years ago and I noticed how silky it made my hair. Follow the instructions and it will make your hair look superb. I&#x27;ve tried a few hair products and this one is my favorite. Compared to the price of other hair products, it&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
    <li> This left a nasty film on my hair and didn&#x27;t give great protection from heat, but it did smell good. I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> It smells so good and works amazingly. But it before your hair is dead and smells bad xD ahaha just really its amazing</li>
    <li> Not only is this a great product from a cruelty-free company, it also smells AMAZING!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t purchase. It smells terrible. You smell like a beach and it did not work for me at all.</li>
    <li> I like the fragrance it seems to be more water and alcohol. Needs more oil for heat protection. Perhaps a new design for different  types of hair.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping for good things from this product after reading so many glowing reviews.  I use their shampoo, conditioner and relaxing balm for my out of control wavy hair.  It does help to get my hair super straight (although that could be from the really good flat iron I have), and it smells great. It also seems to decrease the dry ends look that you get from using thermal tools on your hair.  I don&#x27;t get the heavy feeling from it that people complain of, even after sleeping on it. What I DO get, is unbelievable static in my hair from using it, that hair spray won&#x27;t even tame.  So for me, on to try another protecting spray.</li>
    <li> Good but weighed my hair down</li>
    <li> I have very thick, course,curly hair and this product does wonders along with a flat iron.  I will use it everytime I straighten my hair.  Makes my hair look smooth with barely any frizzies.</li>
    <li> After I run my flat iron through my hair, my hair gets stiff and separated. It&#x27;s weird. And it makes it too shiny.</li>
    <li> Okay first it smells amazing like coconuts but it kind of makes your hair sticky and hard to brush through after you spray this in it does help straighten but leaves your hair hard to brush and dried out</li>
    <li> This left my hair heavy and oily.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it rather I think Matrix Styling Spray for flat irons  is better.</li>
    <li> I used it a few times. There are two problems with the product. One, it is very hard to spray with one hand...even with two hands. The other problem is you have to have your hair dry already before spraying it. Using this spray at that point defeats having any protection from the heat, and the alcohol contents further dries the mantle of the hair.</li>
    <li> It leaves my hair shiny and soft. Also, I won&#x27;t straighten without it. I have been using this product for about a year now. I don&#x27;t feel the need to replace it with anything else...</li>
    <li> The good thing is it shines while adding nutrients to the hair.  the bad thing is I found the hair needs to be washed more frequently ( looks greasy) than when not used.  but it does a great job in setting curls and waves.</li>
    <li> Not going to rate this as &amp;#34;i hate it&amp;#34; because I never did recieve the product and had to get my money back.</li>
    <li> I am a curly girl with 3b hair. (same or very similar to celebrity Jordan Sparks curly hair)&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to me to find a light weight heat protectant that smooths my hair as well as protects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;listen to me when I say, I HAVE FOUND THE ANSWERS TO MY PRAYERS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this back in November along with the Organix coconut serum hoping this would work in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;and to my surprise it does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I spray in my towel dry/damp hair&lt;br /&gt;2. I separate my hair into 4 sections and add ONE pump of the Coconut serum to each section&lt;br /&gt;3. Blow Dry each section thoroughly&lt;br /&gt;4. lightly spray the ends of each section and flat iron 1 inch sections&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this Keratin Flatiron Spray keeps my hair soft, shiny and straight for up to 2 weeks or until I have to wash it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swear I will never buy anything else to straighten my hair, this is my GO TO product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no more dry brittle ends from products that don&#x27;t work, or greasy hair from products that are too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just PERFECT straight hair every time :)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use on dry hair then flat iron as directions specify. It&#x27;ll singe. My hair is pretty thick and very long. I spray on a lot while my hair is wet, then blow it straight, then flat iron. I got 4 uses out of the whole bottle.</li>
    <li> OMG Is all I can say . This is the best I have tryed yet !!  Shine shine shine with no Frizz at all !</li>
    <li> This product protects my daughter&#x27;s hair from flat iron use.  It makes it smooth and shiny, rather than brittle and dry.  A great find.</li>
    <li> I liked how this product left my hair smelling good and it did make it shiny.  I used it after I flat ironed to give it a more glossy look.</li>
    <li> Used this...was no better than using any other brand of any hair protecting/setting spray. Bought it based on the great reviews, but although it works, it was in no way as fantastic as some of the 5-star reviews would have us believe. It works, for a short time, that&#x27;s all. Hair was smooth for a few hours. Shine negligible. Good thing I did not break the bank to get it.</li>
    <li> I love it! It leaves my hair feeling silky and smooth after applying it. I recommend it to anyone who uses a flat iron.</li>
    <li> I am a West Indian girl, typically we have very thick, coarse hair. My hair is about half way down my back in addition and I have been looking for a product to speed up my flat ironing time, lock out humidity, and added shine. This product gives that! I spray each section before flat ironing and and it makes my hair super soft, shiny, and no frizz what so ever! I have tried almost all the over the counter products, and none of them can compare. Give this a shot, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> Arrived well packaged and with no leaks.  It smells greats and hopefully will work just as well.</li>
    <li> awesome product makes my hair smell amazing!!</li>
    <li> I have seen this product in stores and was tempted to purchase - I flat iron my hair frequently, and any additional help is always appreciated.  I saw the price on Amazon and thought I&#x27;d try it.  It is garbage.  When I flat iron my hair without it, I maintain straight hair for two or more days.  I&#x27;ve used this twice, and both times, my hair didn&#x27;t hold the straight appearance longer than four hours.  Not worth any money at all!</li>
    <li> I love the body and shine you get with this spray.</li>
    <li> i had been trying different thing to get rid of frizz and to look straight. This product did the trick. My first time using i sprayed my hair all over then flat ironed. But when I sprayed it by sections.......Wow it was softer, shiner and straight. No frizz to be seen on this head. Would reccomend this product to fellow African Americans.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and was so excited about finding an affordable product that would be able to cut down on the time I spend getting ready in the morning. I completed the entire treatment and my hair is curlier than usual, it is not feeling smoothed out or thicker. Sure, my hair looked amazing after I blow dried and flat ironed it, but now its unruly. I do not have thick curly hair, but it is long, wavy and easy to blow dry/straighten. This product has done nothing for my hair. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this product. Another plus is that it does not leave the hair heavy and weighed down. Excellent!</li>
    <li> I am an african american with natural curly hair. Rain &amp; humidity are not my best friends. If i wear my hair straight on a rainy day it will curly up in about a minute. this morning was the first time i used the flat iron spray &amp; im impressed! Today is a rainy, windy day &amp; i left out for work this morning with straight hair &amp; arrived to work with straight hair! I&#x27;ve been using all types of products &amp; never got this result! i am highly recommending this!</li>
    <li> This product works great and smells amazing.  I put it in my hair before I use a flat iron and it definitely protects my hair and keeps it shiny.  Did I mention the smell? it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> Give great application with Flat Iron. Applying the product before using the flat iron has provided a very nice look.</li>
    <li> No item has arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No item has arrived. Please indicate the reason as soon as possible. thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks very much</li>
    <li> So glad I purchased this - it makes my hair smooth and soft. I spray it on my hair when it&#x27;s dry and then just run my flat iron through it, and it gets silky soft. Note that the bottle that arrives is a different shape than in the picture, but it seems to be the same product.</li>
    <li> Smells like coconut and very soft not sticky its definetly for straightning i tried ti use it bwfore curling my hair and it literaly didnt let my hair curl at all...when i curled the hair i had not spray the hair held....great for its purpose</li>
    <li> I have nearly waist length hair that is extremely thick and curly.  I have it chemically  straightened once a year.  The new growth is hard to manage and this is the first product I&#x27;ve come across that does the job. The hair cuticle is closed and my hair lies close to my head instead of bushing out.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product to keep my hair from getting frizzy when I flat ironed it.  As I checked out the reviews on this product I decided to give it a try.  I am so glad that I did.  This Keratin spray leaves my hair smooth and is awesome.  I highly reccoment it.</li>
    <li> I do not see what all the hype is about, it is not the best product in the world. I do not think I will buy this product again! :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year and all I can say is: Wow. This is the best straightener product I&#x27;ve ever used after decades and decades of trying various products. My hair is coarse and wavy, but it always has a tendency to frizz in the humidity. Started to use the products by Organix Ever and they are the only, the ONLY thing that has worked for my hair. Love it. And I used to spend hundreds on products at salons.&lt;br /&gt;Get it. Either here or at Target. It&#x27;s worth taking a chance on.</li>
    <li> It was okay. I am not sure if it&#x27;s one of the best sprays out there but its ok and gentle to use.</li>
    <li> This smells so good I end up smelling my hair all day long, though when applying has under tone of alcohol smell. It made my hair shiny and healthy looking even though I flat ironed, though I thought it would help keep my hair straight longer and it did not, I still use as a heat protectant and for shine and smell :)</li>
    <li> I was expecting a flat iron defense like the one I have been using. But much to my surprise this product left my hair soft, shiny, and most of all the protection I have been looking for. I thought I ordered one, but I ordered two and I am forever grateful for my mistake. Great things come in all sizes, and this is one of them. Hats off to this wonderful product!!</li>
    <li> Nice smoothing hair treatment that smells wonderful</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> I really like this product! I bought it about a week ago and I&#x27;ve only used it once but I did notice a difference in how straight my hair was. I am an african american female with natural (no relaxer, no hair dye, no chemical) hair and I was looking for a really good heat protectant since I like to wear my hair straight not curly. The product didn&#x27;t leave my hair weighed down or greasy. I didn&#x27;t experience any &amp;#34;sizzling&amp;#34; like I do with other heat protectant sprays. My hair was left smooth and not frizzy. I would definitely buy again and plan to make it apart of my hair care routine.</li>
    <li> Great product, it helps even when you are not using hot iron. This product line is great and inexpensive</li>
    <li> I love this spray! I use it everyday and it does a great job protecting my ends from the heat of my straightener. I just have to occasionally clean it off my straightener, which is expected.</li>
    <li> I bought this after I had a keratin straightening done, but it doesn&#x27;t do much more than any other anti-friz or pre flat ironing spray does that you can find anywhere.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and use the instyler (which is awesome) and thought this may help make it a little smoother with a few frizzies but didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is not comparable to having a professional Keratin treatment done on your hair, but it is an awesome product! I use it every time I iron my hair and it leaves it so smooth while protecting it from the heat.  The smell is amazing as well! Makes me feel like I&#x27;m in an island somewhere.</li>
    <li> Overall this product does a great job with heat protection and straightening the hair.  However, the alcohol scent can be a bit strong for my daughter and me. She often time complains about it burning her eyes when I&#x27;m spraying it carefully in the back of her hair.  I would recommend it if you don&#x27;t mind the strong alcohol scent.</li>
    <li> Again, another one of my orders came damaged. First it said it was delivered and scanned to my house on the 15th of august, but I had not received my product. About 2 days ago (on the 22nd of august) i received a half empty bottle of the product i had purchased. product was all over the bubble wrap and drenched my receipt so i could not even read my bill.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK.  I would not rave about it, nor would I give it a full thumbs down.</li>
    <li> Was not at all impressed based on what it claimed to do. For my hair it did nothing but add some sheen but did not deliver on its promises.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday before blow drying and straightening and spray a little in after and it makes my hair very soft!!</li>
    <li> I love the product.  The bottle is a bit uncomfortable to hold when spraying but it really does make flat ironing your hair easier.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent just spray and straight it within 5 minutes its done and it lasts till the next time you wash your hairs. I spend 110 $ on other product for this long lasting effect and it was waste.</li>
    <li> I use this when i do my hair and I must say it&#x27;s pretty good. It leaves my hair somewhat shiny and with a chocolatey smell. It&#x27;s good for the price.It came on time and is what the seller said it would be. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday whether if I&#x27;m going to use a heating tool or if I just got out of the shower. This has coconut oil and it is one of the oils help keep protein on your hair. I don&#x27;t like using argan oil because it breaks me out so I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to those who can&#x27;t use argan oil.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if it really helps.  Seems my hair is weighted down a little more.  Don&#x27;t know yet if I like it.  I&#x27;ve used about half a bottle.  Mainly I grab a bunch of hair and spray it on the ends and then just kind of rub it through all my hair.</li>
    <li> I am a Caucasian female with color treated, frizzy hair. This product in combination with my flat iron created major breakage in my hair. Stop using it after a week. Just my experience.</li>
    <li> This thing really works! I wear weaves really exspensive ones and I needed something to help with the frizzies and making the hair straight, OMG this product had my brazillian weave looking like woooooooooow!!! I LOVE IT, HOOKED!!! Nice and light no sticking or clumping, love it love it love it!!! sliky!!!</li>
    <li> This product smells like it has alcohol in it. Being that it&#x27;s cold outside and I have natural hair I try to stay away from products that will dry out my hair. I&#x27;ve used this once with Brazilian Heat flat iron and my hair was frizzy and dry afterwards. I will end up giving this product to my little sister.</li>
    <li> It keeps my hair straight until I wash it out, love it.</li>
    <li> I have fine, curly hair. But there&#x27;s a lot of it. Because of this, I typically have a frizz and volume problem that makes me look close to Einstein without proper hair products. I went from having to use six different products to three because of this beauty here (The other two being a heat protector for wet hair and a hair spray or mousse). You do NOT have to use this for just flat ironing, I used it on my dry, curly hair and it just gave it the most brilliant shine and killed the frizz. I love this to death, and it has become a staple for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would not recommend this on is wet hair, or damp hair (You could get away with slightly damp, though.). If you use it on wet or damp hair, it will leave it sticky (This includes blow drying it or using those wet to dry flat irons.) So use it on dry hair only, and you&#x27;ll be happy as can be.</li>
