      <li>Now I can buy twice as much!!!</li>
      <li>First but was to strong.</li>
      <li>Mild.  </li>
      <li>(I rarely use makup except for eyeshadow) and people always guess my age 10-15 years younger which is always nice.  </li>
      <li>Worth it and now part of my every-other-night routine; sometimes nightly.</li>
      <li>I really like this product!</li>
      <li>This is the first product I have found (at this dose) that my skim loves.</li>
      <li>Product was exactly as promised.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m assuming it is starting to &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; now so I think I&#x27;ll have to wait a few more weeks before giving a more enlightened, full review!</li>
      <li>Not huge but definitely more even, smooth complexion.</li>
      <li>My skin tolerates this very well, I was able to quickly move up to using the product every night, or every other night.</li>
      <li>I will certainly be reordering this again.</li>
      <li>Everyone thinks that I&#x27;m younger than my 65 year old self; both body wise and facially.</li>
      <li>This WILL make your skin more sensitive, especially on sunny days.</li>
      <li>Gentle for new Retinol users!</li>
      <li>I still have to use a light moisturizer (I use Olay Regenerist) to keep my skin from looking looking dry under makeup.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle and for sure will buy again and again in the future!</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>Now One month out certain lines have completely disappeared off my 50 something face.  </li>
      <li>My dermatologist is selling the exact same product for $65.</li>
      <li>I went to see a dermatologist for the first time last year at the age of 52.  </li>
      <li>My dermatologist was surprised that my skin looked as well as it did thanks to lots of moisturizer since I was 15 and daily sunscreen (I live in Arizona)</li>
      <li>Wow is all I can say.</li>
      <li>My skin is soft, brighter, and rested looking.  </li>
      <li>My skin is sensitive.</li>
      <li>I have been paying twice as much for the same product from my dermatologist!</li>
      <li>I would skip the lower strength unless you have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out compare to higher percentage retinol lotions.</li>
      <li>Currently I can only rate it as 3 stars because I haven&#x27;t seen much in the way of results yet.</li>
      <li>I used it every other night at first to avoid irritation.</li>
      <li>At first, overnight use (of a single pump of the product) produced irritation, but it subsided by third use.</li>
      <li>Little tingling the first 3 or so times I used it.</li>
      <li>start out using it twice weekly until you can work up using it night as it can be harsh at first.</li>

<li> I buy a lot of expensive moisturizers and serums without seeing any change in my skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Did not see any benefit.</li>
    <li> I have been paying twice as much for the same product from my dermatologist! Now I can buy twice as much!!!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist is selling the exact same product for $65. Have been using this product for 3 months and have noticed a difference.. Not huge but definitely more even, smooth complexion. Will purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist who said that she uses it herself.  The strength is perfect for my skin.  I still have to use a light moisturizer (I use Olay Regenerist) to keep my skin from looking looking dry under makeup.  My skin is soft, brighter, and rested looking.  I use it every other night and am very happy with the results.  I gave a bottle to my daughter because she felt her skin looked dull and within a week, her skin had brightened and looked luminous.</li>
    <li> Exactly as I expected - This is a reliable seller.</li>
    <li> My skin looks 10 years younger in 2 weeks.  Wow is all I can say.</li>
    <li> I love using this to minimize fine lines along with a skincare regimine</li>
    <li> Noticed that my skin is smoother. I use it 3-4x a week. Didn&#x27;t notice any difference in minor &amp;#34;crows foot&amp;#34; area. Little tingling the first 3 or so times I used it. My skin is sensitive.</li>
    <li> This brand is a favorite of mine. I ordered the 1. First but was to strong. So starting off with lower dose to get skin use to the product. Skin medica is a good line and the prices here are great.</li>
    <li> I really like this product!</li>
    <li> I think that Skin Medica have made their retinol products stronger,either that or my skin has changed. I used to use stronger concentrations now I can only tolerate this strength.</li>
    <li> I buy a lot of expensive moisturizers and serums without seeing any change in my skin. But with this product, after only about a month, I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin looks brighter and tighter! I&#x27;m on my second bottle and for sure will buy again and again in the future!</li>
    <li> Gentle for new Retinol users! Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out compare to higher percentage retinol lotions. Great and fast absorbing</li>
    <li> My skin tolerates this very well, I was able to quickly move up to using the product every night, or every other night. It&#x27;s been 5 weeks and my skin looks smoother, pores look smaller, and I have no lines in my face! This WILL make your skin more sensitive, especially on sunny days. I use Erno Laszlo 3-9 cream on the nights when I don&#x27;t use the retinol complex, it helps my skin to recover and soothes the sensitivity.</li>
    <li> I love this cream!  My dermatologist recommended that I begin using Retin-A so this is what I purchased. Everyone thinks that I&#x27;m younger than my 65 year old self; both body wise and facially. I just love those compliments. SkinMedica Retinol Complex is a definite part of my nightly skin care from now on. start out using it twice weekly until you can work up using it night as it can be harsh at first.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly as promised.</li>
    <li> Caused irritation to the face. It burns every time I use it. Do not use it if you have sentive skin.</li>
    <li> Met expectations. I used it every other night at first to avoid irritation.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!  Best thing I&#x27;ve ever used on my skin!</li>
    <li> Very good, gentle yet powerful.  I use it twice a week at night and it keeps my skin beautiful.  Make sure you use sun protection!</li>
    <li> Currently I can only rate it as 3 stars because I haven&#x27;t seen much in the way of results yet. I&#x27;ve only been using it for approx. 6 weeks, starting out at 2x per week as suggested, and just now worked up to every day (evening). Just starting to notice some flaking skin and slight redness as product described might occur. I&#x27;m assuming it is starting to &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; now so I think I&#x27;ll have to wait a few more weeks before giving a more enlightened, full review!</li>
    <li> I could see no difference in my skin with this product.  I used it nightly but did not have any redness, drying or peeling.  I&#x27;ve decided to try the stronger SkinMedica Retinol Complex .5.  I would skip the lower strength unless you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I went to see a dermatologist for the first time last year at the age of 52.  My dermatologist was surprised that my skin looked as well as it did thanks to lots of moisturizer since I was 15 and daily sunscreen (I live in Arizona) but she suggested I use the SkinMedica Retinol Complet .25 every other day.  I noticed a difference within a couple of weeks of using this product.  There was no irratation and my skin was softer.  I get lots of complements on my skin (I rarely use makup except for eyeshadow) and people always guess my age 10-15 years younger which is always nice.  I would highly recommend this product.  Best beauty buy I&#x27;ve done in a long time.  Make sure to add moisturizer after you apply the product.</li>
    <li> My skin reacts to ANY type of retinol or retin-A.  This is the first product I have found (at this dose) that my skim loves.</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a great price. I paid almost twice the amount previously for the same product so this is a bonus for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Great price---This costs almost half of what I paid in the dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> A friend told me about this product that she purchases from her dermatologist. so being a Prime user I searched and found it here on Amazon.  Even after 1 week only of applying nightly (I&#x27;m used to retinol products) I began seeing a difference. Now One month out certain lines have completely disappeared off my 50 something face.  I will certainly be reordering this again.</li>
    <li> First time I ever tried a product with retinol - why did I not know how great this stuff is!? Amazing product!!!!</li>
    <li> Mild.  Meets my cosmetic surgeon&#x27;s recommendation:  initially, begin with 0.25 and moisturizer; upon exhausting 0.25 supply, graduate to next level (i.e., 0.5), and so forth.  Protocol to accelerate collagen and skin &amp;#34;re-layering&amp;#34; process.</li>
    <li> Great product! I would buy it again! After just a couple of uses you can see the diffference in your skin.</li>
    <li> Indeed, your skin gets used to it. At first, overnight use (of a single pump of the product) produced irritation, but it subsided by third use. I truly believe it shrinks the pores on my nose. Nothing else has achieved that. Does not dry out skin - even when it produced that little bit of irritation (I wouldn&#x27;t call it dry). I never realized retinol wasn&#x27;t just for wrinkles - it is for tightening, shrinking, toning. Worth it and now part of my every-other-night routine; sometimes nightly.</li>
    <li> Caused a rash on my face.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Recommended by my dermatologist and see a huge difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Gentle yet effective.</li>
    <li> ordered again, and again, good product</li>
    <li> Great product, great price</li>
