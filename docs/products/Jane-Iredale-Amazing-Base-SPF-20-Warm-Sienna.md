      <li>I used to buy the pomegranite spray to set the makeup with, but in order to save money I&#x27;m currently using a lavendar water spray-simple and works GREAT!</li>
      <li>I find the more &amp;#34;popular brand&amp;#34; too drying.</li>
      <li>I have yellow undertones and it&#x27;s the perfect shade.</li>
      <li>I love the color.</li>
      <li>I use it more in the summer when I&#x27;ve got color from the sun.</li>
      <li>I have been using Jane Iredale foundation for several years now and have been very happy with this product.  </li>

      <li>Love this makeup.</li>
      <li>I am extremely pleased with Jane Iredale products.</li>
      <li>All my makeup is Jane Iredale - I love this color as well.</li>
      <li>She asked me how do you get your skin to look so smooth and flawless and especially with a powder&amp;#34;?</li>
      <li>Jane Iredale loose powders are the best.  </li>
      <li>It is best if you can go to a Jane Iredale makeup professional first to  have them match your skin with the correct color and product for you.  </li>
      <li>It gives me nice natural look with SPF 20 which I just love!</li>
      <li>During winter months when I&#x27;m not in sun as much I use Warm Silk.</li>
      <li>It goes on so smooth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light on the skin and never feel like I have anything on my face</li>
      <li>This powder goes on light, but lasts through the day.  </li>
      <li>I love the fact that it has such good coverage without looking like I have makeup on.  </li>
      <li>and she was in love with the brand right away......</li>
      <li>I think the company will even send you samples if you&#x27;re a first time buyer to make sure you get the right shade for your complexion.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Jane Iredale for a long time and in times of financial hardships it&#x27;s great to be able to find this on Amazon with a company that offers it at a good price and sends it within the ordered time.</li>
      <li>They are worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to buy this again right now because I gave mine to a girlfriend of mine.</li>
      <li>The Amazing Base brings out the best natural and healthy look with my skin.</li>
      <li>Thanks Jane Iredale!</li>
      <li>I have used Jane Iredale for the last 10 years and love her products.</li>
      <li>I apply a light coat all over my face and a little more on problem areas.  </li>
      <li>Very natural and fresh.  </li>
      <li>The trick is to not have too much on your brush (use a kabuki) and keep swirling.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>That was disappointing but the product is great!</li>
      <li>Just recently I made the mistake of adding a BB cream because everyone seems to be raving about them right now.  </li>
      <li>I need a foundation that provides coverage of dark spots, acne, and fine lines without looking caked-on.  </li>
      <li>and it always looks natural.  </li>
      <li>I use the loose powder first and then the compact makeup as a finisher.</li>
      <li>I was told about this product because I am a fitness instructor and apparently this make-up is used often by dancers because it stays put when you sweat.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used countless Mineral Foundations.. and spent a whole lotta money!</li>
      <li>They cover so well yet are sheer and don&#x27;t sit in wrinkles or give you that pastey corpse face look like Bare Minerals does.  </li>
      <li>So I went from wearing a ton of make-up and suffocating my face to wearing this light-weight mineral foundation with SPF 20 and other ingredients that are actually good for my skin.  </li>

    <li> I am in my 30&#x27;s and do not have the best skin.  I need a foundation that provides coverage of dark spots, acne, and fine lines without looking caked-on.  I have tried just about everything from extremely expensive products to drug store brands.  I would wear concealer, foundation, and powder, and still need to touch up several times through out the day.  Amazing Base provides coverage ALL DAY and never rubs off.  I was told about this product because I am a fitness instructor and apparently this make-up is used often by dancers because it stays put when you sweat.  So I went from wearing a ton of make-up and suffocating my face to wearing this light-weight mineral foundation with SPF 20 and other ingredients that are actually good for my skin.  My skin has improved dramatically and I am much more confident.  People began to comment immediately on how good my skin looked.  I apply a light coat all over my face and a little more on problem areas.  If I need heavy coverage for dark circles or I am just having on of those days where I am tired and you can see it all over my face, I will use my finger to apply more of the powder or wet the end of my small make-up brush.  It&#x27;s incredibly versatile.  Also, I have olive skin and get dark in the sun.  I wear the same color and it always looks natural.  I&#x27;ve used this product for at least 5 years and cannot imagine finding anything comparable.    Just recently I made the mistake of adding a BB cream because everyone seems to be raving about them right now.  I gave my boyfriend a hug and it was all over his shirt.  It was rather embarrassing. I have never had that problem when wearing Amazing Base and will not be making that mistake again.</li>
    <li> No complaints on this, that means it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> I have used Jane Iredale for the last 10 years and love her products. I use the loose powder first and then the compact makeup as a finisher. This seems to help the powder to stay on longer before touch ups.  On a scale of 1 to 10 it&#x27;s a 10 in my book!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I suffer from severe cystic acne. this foes t break me out.</li>
    <li> This powder goes on light, but lasts through the day.  I don&#x27;t feel like my face is caked with make up, but it looks like it has a nice even tone. One layer of poweder is all I need, an it takes out the shine and red blotches.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Everything made by Jane Airedale is a must buy! I&#x27;m going to buy this again right now because I gave mine to a girlfriend of mine. She asked me how do you get your skin to look so smooth and flawless and especially with a powder&amp;#34;? I simply took her to my bathroom and applied it and she was in love with the brand right away......Just like I was</li>
    <li> I love the color. It goes on so smooth.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I was told it was non-comedogenic (on the product website). When I received the product and looked up the ingredients, 3 of the ingredients are comedogenic. I tried the product, and ended up breaking out.</li>
    <li> At this point. I would like to be refunded my money back. This has been too much trouble for me. Thank u.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve used it before and love the way it works.  Now I can get it at a discount at Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;However, it took longer than stated and expected and I paid the postage required.  That was disappointing but the product is great!</li>
    <li> Only foundation I will use after 20+ years. The trick is to not have too much on your brush (use a kabuki) and keep swirling. Dip brush in lid after you&#x27;ve shaken some of the powder into it, then work it into the brush. Tap to remove excess. Swirl all over face, I even include my eye lids, but at the end of the swirling. Great lid primer. I find the more &amp;#34;popular brand&amp;#34; too drying. This is perfect. Doesn&#x27;t cake. Smooth as can be with a healthy bit of glow (not glitter!).</li>
    <li> Great for oily skin, the only base I use.  Went to facialist for years, this is what she recommended to minimize my pores</li>
    <li> This is my third container I&#x27;ve purchased over the years.  I love the fact that it has such good coverage without looking like I have makeup on.  It&#x27;s light on the skin and never feel like I have anything on my face yet it gives me the coverage I want. Thanks Jane Iredale!</li>
    <li> You can NEVER go wrong with Jane Iredale products.  They are worth every penny.  Usually you have to go to a cosmetic surgeons office to get them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Jane Iredale for a long time and in times of financial hardships it&#x27;s great to be able to find this on Amazon with a company that offers it at a good price and sends it within the ordered time. Good experience with a good product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used countless Mineral Foundations.. and spent a whole lotta money! I keep on coming back to and will continue from here on out using Jane Iredale. It gives me nice natural look with SPF 20 which I just love! Warm Sienna is great when I have tan.. I use it more in the summer when I&#x27;ve got color from the sun. I have yellow undertones and it&#x27;s the perfect shade. During winter months when I&#x27;m not in sun as much I use Warm Silk. I used to buy the pomegranite spray to set the makeup with, but in order to save money I&#x27;m currently using a lavendar water spray-simple and works GREAT!</li>

    <li> Love this makeup. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing makeup. Goes on perfectly.</li>
    <li> This base does not go on cakey.  Used with the pommist it stays on for hours.</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with Jane Iredale products. The Amazing Base brings out the best natural and healthy look with my skin. When I use D2 O2 spray as the finishing touch everything feels better than my own skin!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I think the company will even send you samples if you&#x27;re a first time buyer to make sure you get the right shade for your complexion. I honestly will never buy another foundation from another company again. People always comment on the smoothness and &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; of my skin and I know it&#x27;s the foundation. It&#x27;s truly worth the cost!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Jane Iredale foundation for several years now and have been very happy with this product.  It is also much less expensive buying it through Amazon versus at a salon or dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> All my makeup is Jane Iredale - I love this color as well.</li>
