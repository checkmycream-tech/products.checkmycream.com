    <li> Great product.  I was looking for a cruelty free shampoo that&#x27;s works and feels great and this is it! Smells great too!! No oily residue just clean hair.  My hair stylist recommended it and I&#x27;m so happy I tried it!  Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I received this product and suspect that it was switched out for another cheaper shampoo. I have been using this product shampoo for years, &amp; it has the same consistency as the moisturizing conditioner. This shampoo is NOT suppose to be clear &amp; smells nothing like the product I have been using for years. I&#x27;m furious.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as good as it does in the salon....hmmm. But it still gets the job done!</li>
    <li> Loma Organics has changed my hair!  It used to be dry and coarse feeling, damaged from &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair color.  But now my hair is so soft!  I use this as well as the Daily Shampoo and Moisturizing Treatment (conditioner).</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 2 years and previously ordered from this vendor in the past. My last order with them was perfect.

I don&#x27;t like leaving bad reviews but I fell it&#x27;s important to warn people what to expect.</li>
    <li> One word:  scam. This is NOT the Loma line...the &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; was broken and I&#x27;m certain it has been replaced with Walmart products...</li>
    <li> Love this Shampoo, would recommend to anyone with all types of hair!  I really believe my hair is healthier after using this product.  :-)</li>
    <li> love this stuff.  my sister uses it, so I thought I would give it a try.  hair feels clean and full of body.</li>
    <li> I really love the Loma shampoo, I been using it for 3 months and I been seeing my hair grow longer a little bit in length. This is my second bottle I ordered and I will continue to use it since other shampoo&#x27;s haven&#x27;t been so nice on my hair.</li>

    <li> Love this shampoo it&#x27;s great for my fine hair</li>
    <li> Smells like oranges, pricey for daily shampoo. It dries out my hair if i dont condition with their brand of conditioner with their shampoo, so its pretty pricey</li>
    <li> Loma products are the best Organic product line I have ever used. I have been using them since 2001 when my neighbor in  Maple Valley, Wa introduced me to them. It&#x27;s harder to get them at a,reasonable price,  (as a retired stylist with out a curent license)they are worth the money.  Thank you Loma carriers whow sell on Amazon</li>
    <li> Husband swears by this shampoo. And it works extremely well for his very dry gray hair that is super gorgeous.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like how it washed my hair.  I need a step up in moisture.  I ordered the moisturizing shampoo.  Thais order was an error but I could tell the difference.  Still a great line and a great company with fantastic projects.</li>
