      <li>Keep some old things and add some new and leave the good ones along.</li>
      <li>, it was almost unnoticeable and served very well as a light hairspray.  </li>
      <li>But someone who likes to do hair might have success.</li>
      <li>Nioxin has to many other products that work better.</li>
      <li>Very good action to poof the roots, but do not use it on the rest of your hair because it is too strong and will dull it.  </li>
      <li>I like it very much and will absolutely continue to use it !!</li>
      <li>Speaking of which; I always  ( a strong mesure) have to run the spray nozel under hot water to clear the spray opening.</li>
      <li>, I have very fine, thin hair that needs alot of lift, maybe I am expecting to much, but I do use another brand that gives me good results.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand why a company discontinues a product when you use it regularly, but that seem to be what most of them do these days.</li>
      <li>Now I have double of a product I love in bottles</li>
      <li>Nioxin Volumizing Reflectives Root Lifter does exactly that.  </li>
      <li>This product really works!</li>
      <li>It is hard to find this product any more, and I really love it.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have used the root lifter and it works really well.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you alternate good cleansing shampoos, and if you don&#x27;t have to use it give your hair a little bit of some natural break from products.</li>
      <li>Ihave steadily over the last 10 years lost more andmore hair.  </li>
      <li>the first three times I use this product, I was absolutely amazed at how well it added lift in volume to my roots, made my hair appear thicker, and noticeably filled in some male pattern baldness.</li>
      <li>It does add much needed volume.  </li>
      <li>I really like the way this product give my hair lift and staying power.</li>
      <li>When I opened the envelope the enclosed receipt was completely soaked with the product from the bottle, and the bottle was REALLY hot.</li>
      <li>This stuff makes my hair more manageable without weighing it down.  </li>
      <li>I tried liquid capsules and made my stomach upset because the dose are too high.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended</li>
      <li>The one displayed is the new design</li>
      <li>I ordered a second one hoping I could transfer the contents of the first one to the new pump.  </li>
      <li>The first day maybe I didnt use enough, but didnt do anything at all, the second day there is a little lift, but sticky, I didnt think I used that much more to make my hair sticky.  </li>
      <li>&amp; I received the old bottle design.  </li>
      <li>Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my 50 year old thinning hair.</li>
      <li>The product is in a soft plastic bottle and it was mailed in an envelope with bubble wrap.</li>
      <li>With just one-two applications, hair dried significantly, scalp got itchier and discolored hair.</li>
      <li>I did not expect this to work as well, where I expected it to be very much like glue in my hair.</li>
      <li>The Nioxin Root Lifter was exactly what I expected.  </li>
      <li>Alright.... Spray too much of this on your scalp and after you dry your hair you might experience a bit of stiffness to the hair</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how much product others are putting in their hair to make it stiff and coarse because my hair is soft and manageable and yet \\&quot;lifted.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>it did start to build up a little bit of a residue after three straight days of use even with washing it every day.</li>
      <li>I think part of it was on the third day I may have used a little too much as well.</li>

<li> This product really adds a boost to my otherwise flat and shapeless hair.  </li>
<li> First I should point out I&#x27;m not very good with beauty products.</li>
<li> I have natural hair color, never colored or treated my hair any other way.</li>
<li> It left my hair feeling pretty sticky, and hard.</li>
<li> This product replaced a shine gel that Nioxin discontinued - it doesn&#x27;t make your hair shiny, but it does create fullness by fluffing your roots up to look thicker and not so flat.</li>
<li> instead of my hair lying flat on my head~</li>
<li> Lasts, doesn&#x27;t need re-application the next day, just dampen hair and blow dry again!</li>
<li> After applying, I comb it through, wait a bit to &#x27;air dry&#x27;, then hang my head over and blow dry.  </li>
<li> and I have super thin hair!</li>
<li> This stuff does help with volume, but not as much as I expected.</li>
<li> I spray on the roots of my wet hair and then style.  </li>
<li> I have used this for 2 days, not real sure if that is long enought to be writing a review.  </li>
<li> The only down side is it&#x27;s a little sticky.</li>
<li> Oh, the other reason I continue to use it is I CAN&#x27;T TOLERATE</li>
<li> The only negative thing is that sometimes it dries out my hair.  </li>
<li> it immediately thickens your hair strands without weighing them down.</li>
<li> The spray is not very fine.  </li>
<li> I take your product with a little water once a day and no stomach problems anymore.</li>
<li> shipping of product did cause a little leaking of liquid.  </li>
<li> PRODUCT WAS DISCONTINUED AND NOT AVAILABLE IN STORES.THANKS TO YOUR SITE</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been a fan of nioxin products but not this one. I have natural hair color, never colored or treated my hair any other way. Bought it to give my hair a &#x27;lift&#x27; but didn&#x27;t expect it to cause such a ruin. With just one-two applications, hair dried significantly, scalp got itchier and discolored hair. Have trashed it already, what a waste!</li>
    <li> This  is a great styling spray that leaves your hair with a wet look and coming from Nioxin it should be great for your hair unlike other hair sprays. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really like the way this product give my hair lift and staying power. The only down side is it&#x27;s a little sticky.</li>
    <li> I have thinning hair and this helps to lift what hair I do have to give it a fuller look.</li>
    <li> This stuff does help with volume, but not as much as I expected. It left my hair feeling pretty sticky, and hard. Don&#x27;t think I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> The Nioxin Root Lifter was exactly what I expected.  It gives my hair the extra volume that it needs to last all day.</li>
    <li> Great for thinning and fine  hair.  It does add much needed volume.  It is a good addition to my Nioxin hair care.</li>
    <li> it does like it sais, very good value</li>
    <li> When Redken stopped making their wonderful Bodyfull products I started the search for a replacement. And here it is!&lt;br /&gt;Body without stickiness, no helmet hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair feeling gummy and looking dull. Probably will not buy again. Nioxin has to many other products that work better.</li>
    <li> Ihave steadily over the last 10 years lost more andmore hair.  At this point anything to help it feel thicker and lift the roots wouldbe a help, and this volumizing root lifter has thickened my very fine existing hair helping to give it lift.  At this point, there is no miracle cure and the loss of hair is very obvious, but it is helping in managing what hair I have left.</li>
    <li> I simply love the Nioxin products.  Does what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do.  If you have thinning looking hair, it works great.</li>
    <li> I just love it! My nails are growing nicely. Some slower than others but they aren&#x27;t splitting anymore. My dermatologist advised me to take it. I tried liquid capsules and made my stomach upset because the dose are too high. I take your product with a little water once a day and no stomach problems anymore. I am ordering again from you. Thank you for expediting it do I could started immediately. Yes, I will recommend it to a friend. You can control the dose.</li>
    <li> First I should point out I&#x27;m not very good with beauty products. Tried it twice and decided not easy to use and had to wash out sooner than usual. But someone who likes to do hair might have success.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my 50 year old thinning hair. It feels and looks lovely, and is easily styled.</li>
    <li> I use this after every shampoo, and have been for many years.  After applying, I comb it through, wait a bit to &#x27;air dry&#x27;, then hang my head over and blow dry.  Great product.</li>
    <li> The root lifter I purchased definitely helps my hair appear fuller. I like it very much and will absolutely continue to use it !!</li>
    <li> It is hard to find this product any more, and I really love it. I don&#x27;t understand why a company discontinues a product when you use it regularly, but that seem to be what most of them do these days. Keep some old things and add some new and leave the good ones along.</li>
    <li> 5 stars..it immediately thickens your hair strands without weighing them down. Compared to Matrix root boost it gives more \\&quot;texture\\&quot;.  3 stars for Matrix...5 stars for Nioxin</li>
    <li> The ones selling this product need to display the correct bottle they are selling.  The one displayed is the new design &amp; I received the old bottle design.  They said it was the same product but to me it&#x27;s false advertising.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this product.  Gives hair a lift while blow drying and holds volume throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and have tried many products. Nioxin Volumizing Reflectives Root Lifter makes my hair appear fuller and thicker. The only negative thing is that sometimes it dries out my hair.  All in all I am very satisfied and would actually pay more for the product.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent the price is outrageous</li>
    <li> Does what it says, but sometimes the pump gets clogged or is slow to pump out, which can be frustrating.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. It&#x27;s not sticky like gells, and gives my hair lots of body.Nioxin products are great. Purchased from Amazon of course.Great place to shop.</li>
    <li> I have been using a number of the Nioxin products for several years and they definitely work in reducing hair loss. This is the first time I have used the root lifter and it works really well. The problem I had with this purchase is in the packaging. The product is in a soft plastic bottle and it was mailed in an envelope with bubble wrap. When I opened the envelope the enclosed receipt was completely soaked with the product from the bottle, and the bottle was REALLY hot. I did not send it back because of the hassle of sending it back, but I won&#x27;t order from this company again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;v ordered this for some time - spray &#x27;til hair is damp ONLY on roots.  The spray is not very fine.  If you spray more than a mist on the length of your hair you might not be able get a comb, brush or fingers through it. I would love it if the manufacturer would provide a misting spray  head.  Speaking of which; I always  ( a strong mesure) have to run the spray nozel under hot water to clear the spray opening. SOOO; I must value it a lot.  Oh, the other reason I continue to use it is I CAN&#x27;T TOLERATE ANY FRAGRANCE { SERIOUSLY!}</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used this before! I LOVE IT! I have very fine hair, and this stuff pumps it UP! Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I am definitely noticing fuller hair every time I use this product and I have super thin hair! Definitely a good buy!</li>
    <li> This product really adds a boost to my otherwise flat and shapeless hair.  It takes very little to have a volumizing effect.</li>
    <li> Alright.... Spray too much of this on your scalp and after you dry your hair you might experience a bit of stiffness to the hair</li>
    <li> Nioxin is great for very fine hair.  My hair is so fine and this product and the mousse make it feel like I have more hair.</li>
    <li> Nioxin Volumizing Reflectives Root Lifter does exactly that.  I spray on the roots of my wet hair and then style.  It works beautifully without a heavy feel to your hair.</li>
    <li> Did not give volume.  Would not purchase again.  Cleanser and scalp treatments are wonderful, and live up to their promises, but I would not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I have used Nioxin products for years but not the Volumizing Reflectives Root Lifter.  I love it!  I don&#x27;t know how much product others are putting in their hair to make it stiff and coarse because my hair is soft and manageable and yet \\&quot;lifted.\\&quot; I love this product and the purchase arrived promptly and packaged well.  I WILL buy the product again and from Amazon, of course.</li>
    <li> my hair was getting thinner at the roots since I&#x27;ve turned 75% gray. Even though I have my hair colored monthly, this product does make my hair fuller at the roots and more manageable when styling.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used it for about 3 years. The last 2 I got however, have had pumps that don&#x27;t work. I ordered a second one hoping I could transfer the contents of the first one to the new pump.  But to my dismay that pump didn&#x27;t work either, Now I have double of a product I love in bottles I can&#x27;t get it out of.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT WAS DISCONTINUED AND NOT AVAILABLE IN STORES.THANKS TO YOUR SITE I WAS STILL ABLE TO BUY AT A FAIR PRICE AND GET THE PRODUCT WHICH I LOVE AND USE ALL THE TIME.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for quite a while and seems to work well. I have fine hair, so always a challenge to find good volumizers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin Products for years.  This site provides Nioxin products at a great price and with very quick service.  I will definitely order from them again</li>
    <li> Love this product.  shipping of product did cause a little leaking of liquid.  I have been using this item for years but could not find it at beauty shops; loved finding it on line and cheaper than shops.</li>
    <li> the first three times I use this product, I was absolutely amazed at how well it added lift in volume to my roots, made my hair appear thicker, and noticeably filled in some male pattern baldness. I did not expect this to work as well, where I expected it to be very much like glue in my hair. Quite the opposite, it was almost unnoticeable and served very well as a light hairspray.  The only thing that I would be careful of is given the fact that I have blonde hair that is thinning (at 40 years old) it did start to build up a little bit of a residue after three straight days of use even with washing it every day. I think part of it was on the third day I may have used a little too much as well. Just make sure you alternate good cleansing shampoos, and if you don&#x27;t have to use it give your hair a little bit of some natural break from products. But for that one or two nights or days that you want to look your best... you cannot beat this product along with the line of shampoo and conditioners.</li>
    <li> Nozzle tends to clog, but the product itself is good! Lasts, doesn&#x27;t need re-application the next day, just dampen hair and blow dry again!</li>
    <li> This product replaced a shine gel that Nioxin discontinued - it doesn&#x27;t make your hair shiny, but it does create fullness by fluffing your roots up to look thicker and not so flat.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my hair more manageable without weighing it down.  I actually look like I have hair now instead of my hair lying flat on my head~</li>
    <li> This product really works! My hair is full of volume all day! I have recommended this product to family and friends with fine hair!</li>
    <li> I have used this for 2 days, not real sure if that is long enought to be writing a review.  The first day maybe I didnt use enough, but didnt do anything at all, the second day there is a little lift, but sticky, I didnt think I used that much more to make my hair sticky.  I will keep trying to see if I get the results I want, I have very fine, thin hair that needs alot of lift, maybe I am expecting to much, but I do use another brand that gives me good results.  I just started using the nioxin line so I would like to stay with this root lifter.</li>
    <li> Very good action to poof the roots, but do not use it on the rest of your hair because it is too strong and will dull it.  So just on the roots!</li>
    <li> I found no difference in this \\&quot;volumizing root lifter\\&quot; than many others I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;ll stick to the grocery store/drugstore brands.</li>
