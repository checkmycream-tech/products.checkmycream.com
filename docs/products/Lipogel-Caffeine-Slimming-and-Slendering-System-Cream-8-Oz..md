<ol>
      <li>very good</li>
      <li>very good</li>
      <li>Very very nice thank you Amazon.</li>
      <li>im very satisfied with the care</li>
      <li>they show their costumers:) that is the way a costumer should be treated!</li>
      <li>my product was damaged and i sent the sender(Caribbean Amazing Storefront)</li>
      <li>and i love it.</li>
      <li>I really love this product.</li>
      <li>This make me sweat a lot more while working out and slims up my stomach from excess water weight.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see the result of this product and even thought I love using it..</li>
      <li>so i will love to tell my friends abour it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good thing it didn&#x27;t cost anything really.</li>
      <li>It smells like ben gay--</li>
      <li>Well if used in a proper manner it will have light weight losing properties but much more effective as a slimmer tool.</li>
      <li>The Gel smells better than other gels/creams of this type but its about as good anything out there.</li>
      <li>All it did was give a funky smell and made my skin feel cool and tingly.  </li>
      <li>I will be ordering more very soon.</li>
      <li>Which considering a lot of products that tote the same thing and don&#x27;t deliver even that much, was very pleased with my purchase.</li>
      <li>(Thermal wrap or any wrap actually already adds heat to the area, causing the covered area to sweat more.)</li>
      <li>Whereas the chili or hot slimming products are supposed to &#x27;melt&#x27; the fat.</li>
      <li>It mostly feels like your skin tingles for a while but even after using 2 full bottles of it, I haven&#x27;t even seen any visible tightening in the mid-section and /or improvement of any other kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Hence the belief of some that a person should use both, to really see &#x27;weight loss&#x27; )</li>
      <li>I have not seen much results.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as intense as some that I have tried.&lt;br</li>
      <li>What I found was that I didn&#x27;t notice how much sweat poured out of me, till I removed the band.</li>
      <li>It really wirks.no complients on my end.</li>
      <li>Maybe it will work given time, but I don&#x27;t hold out much hope</li>
      <li>Though have read other&#x27;s who saw more sweat &amp; results with a wrap then without.</li>
      <li>(The cooling effect is what is supposed to shrink the fat cells down, creating a more smoother, softer looking skin/body.  </li>
      <li>As someone who&#x27;s tried most slimming gels or creams currently on the market, I have to say the cooling effect of this one is a bit like putting on Icy Hot sports rub.</li>
      <li>The gel is cooling, with a fresh scent - the scent doesn&#x27;t last, but when you first open the jar it sort of smells like opening a can of Sprite or 7Up.</li>
      <li>Have been only been using this gel for the duration of the first jar but will not be replacing.</li>
      <li>bare in mind, there&#x27;s been no such thing, in my experience, where I&#x27;ve been able to put on a cream/gel or even take a pill, and the next day the jeans I&#x27;ve been unable to fit for so many years, suddenly miraculously fits.</li>
      <li>This is my second jar so i rated 4 for the product in my first try but my  second order i have didnot arrived yet for a month now.</li>
      <li>Lipogel smells like icy hot and has the same affect as icy hot.</li>
      <li>might* be doing something, which is why i gave it 3 stars, but if they are, they definitely take a LONG time to work, so it will be a while before you see any real progress.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i can feel it and I think it works</li>
    <li> my product was damaged and i sent the sender(Caribbean Amazing Storefront) a message and was in no time at all the sender has replied with an apology and i was told my product is being replaced! im very satisfied with the care they show their costumers:) that is the way a costumer should be treated! i have yet to try the product will post back if it works!</li>
    <li> Very very nice thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> very good and i love it. it has been helping me from the frist day have been using it. so i will love to tell my friends abour it. very good</li>
    <li> very disapointed, waste  time</li>
    <li> The gel is cooling, with a fresh scent - the scent doesn&#x27;t last, but when you first open the jar it sort of smells like opening a can of Sprite or 7Up. (The cooling effect is what is supposed to shrink the fat cells down, creating a more smoother, softer looking skin/body.  Hence the appearance of inch loss. Whereas the chili or hot slimming products are supposed to &#x27;melt&#x27; the fat. Hence the belief of some that a person should use both, to really see &#x27;weight loss&#x27; ) As someone who&#x27;s tried most slimming gels or creams currently on the market, I have to say the cooling effect of this one is a bit like putting on Icy Hot sports rub. It&#x27;s not as intense as some that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;As a person who also never works out - bad I know. I tried this product for approx. a week, with no exercise or wrap. And I still saw firming on the areas where I applied this gel. I also spent one day working out with the gel around my midsection, and a thermal wrap over it. (Thermal wrap or any wrap actually already adds heat to the area, causing the covered area to sweat more.) What I found was that I didn&#x27;t notice how much sweat poured out of me, till I removed the band. Which normally after a 1/2 hour, I&#x27;m drenched &amp; really uncomfortable. So, for me, would not use the wrap in future in combination with the gel, but def. after the wrap to tighten what hopefully was melted off. Though have read other&#x27;s who saw more sweat &amp; results with a wrap then without. (Personally, would recommend a chili oil or heat based product) So, this is where I would recommend people to try it out for themselves as they may receive a different result than mine.&lt;br /&gt;Also bare in mind, there&#x27;s been no such thing, in my experience, where I&#x27;ve been able to put on a cream/gel or even take a pill, and the next day the jeans I&#x27;ve been unable to fit for so many years, suddenly miraculously fits. It&#x27;s not a work out in a bottle. (That&#x27;s coming from a person who doesn&#x27;t work out mind) But I have lost a cm or so, and will probably end up losing an inch, overall, by the end of the container. Which considering a lot of products that tote the same thing and don&#x27;t deliver even that much, was very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> No good a waste of my money.did not do anything even with me dieting n excersing ..i watched my intake no junk food  used it twice a day...</li>
    <li> I have not seen much results.</li>
    <li> This stuff sucks!!!!!!</li>
    <li> this Is not doing anything to me I don&#x27;t see the result of this product and even thought I love using it..but if I don&#x27;t see a result I cant just buy it again..sorry...</li>
    <li> Works especially well when working out.  Increased my sweat with my waist trainer on.</li>
    <li> Have been only been using this gel for the duration of the first jar but will not be replacing. I figured I would give it a whirl but no changes have been noticed.</li>
    <li> I saw no change while using this product. Lipogel smells like icy hot and has the same affect as icy hot.</li>
    <li> I did not see any difference in my cellulite.  I appreciate the try.</li>
    <li> The Gel smells better than other gels/creams of this type but its about as good anything out there. It mostly feels like your skin tingles for a while but even after using 2 full bottles of it, I haven&#x27;t even seen any visible tightening in the mid-section and /or improvement of any other kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least some of the ingredients *might* be doing something, which is why i gave it 3 stars, but if they are, they definitely take a LONG time to work, so it will be a while before you see any real progress.</li>
    <li> This does not work it, I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product, I&#x27;ll will not be buying this item again. This just smells minty!😒</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work.  Although I&#x27;m still using it, only because I don&#x27;t like to waste money.  Maybe it will work given time, but I don&#x27;t hold out much hope</li>
    <li> Only used it one time.</li>
    <li> I should&#x27;ve trusted my instincts.  It has a medicinal menthol scent.  I tried it on one arm and measured it prior to using the product.  The jar is finished and I did not see results.  All it did was give a funky smell and made my skin feel cool and tingly.  I did not exercise my arm but was on a diet.  Maybe it would have given me results if I exercised but... I  won&#x27;t to buy another jar to find out if it will.</li>
    <li> This product seems to state that just rubbing it on will lose the weight. This IS NOT true. So why give it 4 stars you ask? Well if used in a proper manner it will have light weight losing properties but much more effective as a slimmer tool. I have used it around my stomach and waist underneath my neoprene waist band. This make me sweat a lot more while working out and slims up my stomach from excess water weight.</li>
    <li> I will be ordering more very soon. I have been using this product for about almost one week now and it works for me.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It really wirks.no complients on my end.I would by again and recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it slimmed me or not, because i was using other products as well, but it definitely gave me a burn upon application...</li>
    <li> This is my second jar so i rated 4 for the product in my first try but my  second order i have didnot arrived yet for a month now.</li>
    <li> This works wonders with saran wrap and/or a waist trainer/cincher</li>
    <li> It smells like ben gay-- I hate the smell of methanol any thing. I don&#x27;t know if it works it gags me..</li>
    <li> I want to put a big fat 0 star. But I cant so. I&#x27;ll say that&#x27;s my rating. It&#x27;s a good thing it didn&#x27;t cost anything really.</li>
