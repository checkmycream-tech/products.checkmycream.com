      <li>All the colors are very bright and fun.</li>
      <li>The colors are so nicely picked up by the brushes and evenly spread on the eyes.  </li>
      <li>I chose this rating because of the fact I liked that what you see is what you get.</li>
      <li>and they go on nicely...</li>
      <li>I really liked this palette.</li>
      <li>Beautiful colors, but I would suggest wetting the shadow by dabbing your brush into a bit of water or a quick lick.</li>
      <li>I have always loved bright and bold colors on eyes</li>
      <li>It goes on very easy.</li>
      <li>I was super impressed with how quickly it arrived.</li>
      <li>I am always in need of eyebrushes, so that was a let down, but still a great product nonetheless :D</li>
      <li>this is the first time ive tried fash its great</li>
      <li>The colors are bright and super</li>
      <li>But I really love the variety of colors and that they shimmer.</li>
      <li>I love the way that it glides on to the lid and the way the color stands out ..</li>
      <li>I was very impressed with the quality especially for the price.</li>
      <li>I love the colors in this palette.</li>

      <li>I would recommend this to anyone and will be looking to purchase more from this company.</li>
      <li>i will be buying more soon...</li>

      <li>Had never heard of Fash before but ordered on a whim and am glad I did.</li>
      <li>One of the things I don&#x27;t like is the fact that there are way too many pinks and reds.</li>

      <li>The colours are just ok; not quite what I was expecting, but</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not opposed to shimmer, most eyeshadows have it, but these seem to be 50/50 shimmer and color</li>
      <li>i love to use eye primer with any eyeshadow product it helps the color show more on your skin and keeps it in place.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this formy Mom, and she loves it! She wears it everyday. The colors are very pigmented and do not contain much fallout. Nice!</li>
    <li> pallete is NOT that bright, or vivid, kinda dull to me. Was looking for some extra POP &amp; shimmer, not impressed with these colors...colors displayed on pic look way more vivd than my purchase.  Cant seem to find the first pallete I brought on amazon but gave to my sister, That was the best colorful eyeshadow ever. Can anyone tell me how to go back on my purchases like 10 months ago!!!???Thats the pallete I am searching for but can  never seem to find :(</li>
    <li> I just love this eyeliner palette. All the colors were intact when I received it. I&#x27;ve even dropped it once on accident and all of them are fine. The colors are bright and very nice, even when I don&#x27;t feel like using a primer. They blend together well If you dip your brush in a tiny bit a water, they are super bright. It was definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> This is my third purchase of this Flash 40 Color Shimmer Eyeshadow Palette from AMAZON-  I bought these as gifts for Daughter &amp; Granddaughter then I decided on one for myself.  It&#x27;s a great product glides on with a creamy texture yet is a powder.   Great to try out various combinations of color,  you will be surprised at the fabulous combinations that will match everything in your wardrobe.  When you mix colors you can&#x27;t believe how gorgeous your eyes will look....Don&#x27;t hesitate on this one it&#x27;s really great.  Enjoy</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get this because I&#x27;m getting it as a Christmas gift for my sister. Upon opening the box it was very messy, eyeshadow smeared all over. At least 4 of them were completely broken and all over the other eyeshadows. I&#x27;m very disappointed that I have to give my sister a gift that is missing some of the eyeshadows. I&#x27;m only giving it a 3 because the eyshadow is pretty good, although very very small. Will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my  sister for Christmas.  It was in a nice case and the shadow seemed to be of good quality for the price.  I would buy the product again.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this product. It goes on very easy. Wish there were a few more neutral colors and less orange and red. I would recommend this to anyone and will be looking to purchase more from this company. Next purchase will be less shimmer more matte.</li>
    <li> I really liked this palette. The colors are really vibrant and it comes out really nice. They don&#x27;t last as long as some of the other eyeshadows I have, but I really am happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the money for all the colors you get.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping and an even more amazing product. I would recommend buying a primer in order to make the colors truly pop! The colors are really pigmented and nothing was damaged. Overall a really great product</li>
    <li> I got this today right on schedule and I was pleasantly surprised, the colors are absolutely beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;The eyeshadows arrived intact and protectively wrapped. Needless to say I will be ordering the rest of this collection.</li>
    <li> Had never heard of Fash before but ordered on a whim and am glad I did. This palette has very pretty colors and are very pigmented. I&#x27;ve used already and just love them. I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I just recieved this palette in the mail today and the colors are very bright and just like the picture. None of them were broken and none were dingy. They all go on very smoothly and look wonderful when used with a white base!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I normally just wear a black smoky eye and i wanted to change it up a bit. I have always loved bright and bold colors on eyes but they never looked good on me. SO..i was searching for makeup to buy and i spotted this and took a chance on it hoping that this would maybe look good on me. SO GLAD I DID! I love it! The colors are as bold as they are shown and if you wanted to, you could smudge it a bit for less of a dramatic look. I don&#x27;t even use primer for it and it stays on all day long! I suggest this to anyone who is sick of boring same old same old makeup and want their eyes to pop! I&#x27;m so glad i bought this because it is worth every penny! Don&#x27;t worry about looking like there is too much makeup on because although they are bold colors, again smudging it can make the lime green and bright reds look almost natural. I suggest this to every girl!</li>
    <li> The pallet arrived on time and intact, I have no complaints about that, however after using a variety of the colors, I&#x27;m not impressed at all. The colors as a whole are ok, if you are using a dark color it&#x27;s ok. With lighter colors it&#x27;s a maybe and the in-between colors they all just look like a silvery glitter with hardly any distinction between the actual colors, to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a few 6-color pallets of LA Color, which I can get from the dollar store for a dollar that give me more color. Maybe it&#x27;s because I have a darker complexion, but that&#x27;s really no excuse, as the company should be considering it&#x27;s entire target audience: people who wear eye makeup. This is a large and varied group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I also feel that there is a bit too much shimmer in the colors. I&#x27;m not opposed to shimmer, most eyeshadows have it, but these seem to be 50/50 shimmer and color, maybe that&#x27;s because the color is not very pigmented, I&#x27;m not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end I&#x27;m very disappointed, and feeling as if I should have gone with another brand instead. I&#x27;m not one to return things, so I will most likely give it to one of my younger cousins who are in that &#x27;playing&#x27; stage for makeup. That&#x27;s really all I feel like it&#x27;s good for at this point.</li>
    <li> bought this for my gf and she really like it.  Def worth the price and she said alot of colors to choose from.</li>
    <li> my palette ended up having several color that broke due to horrible handling, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AND SAVE YOURSELF THE HEADACHE OF HAVING TO SEND BACK A PALETTE WITH SEVERAL BROKEN COLORS IN IT, IT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY.  It looks as if their is not enough amount of eye shadow colors in the palettes, it looks empty. Don&#x27;t buy this product not worth the money. I also did not appreciate the delivery guy/woman shoving the box into my mailbox.</li>
    <li> The colors are great, and everything was in good condition.  I gave it 3 stars however because it didn&#x27;t come with a brush, and the colors aren&#x27;t as bright when you wear them... you need a lot.  Granted I didn&#x27;t use a primer but I usually don&#x27;t have to, even if I don&#x27;t use really expensive brands.  However, I think it&#x27;s worth the price.  Maybe invest in a primer or something.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors, but I would suggest wetting the shadow by dabbing your brush into a bit of water or a quick lick. Will def take a look at other products from you guys!</li>
    <li> Pretty good quality for the price.  The colors are vibrant, kind of like Mac eyeshadows.  I will definitely purchase this again.  Fun to play around with.</li>
    <li> I really like this pallete. Colors are vibrant and very pigmented, arrived in tact with none broken or missing. I have used it a couple times  and the shadow always stays vibrant until I take it off at night. Beyond my basic foundation i don&#x27;t use any other primer.    I just wsh they offered some matte colors through fash as I don&#x27;t always want to wear shimmers</li>
    <li> The eyeshadow is awesome, I got it very fast, and they have plenty of helpful colors for me to choose from. Very useful and awesome for the price.</li>
    <li> I love the colors that come with this palette. I do wish there was a little more of each color, and a mirror, but this was great for the price.</li>
    <li> Has lots a color variety, the colors are very bold and vibrant. This product didnt take long to ship and was in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I was super impressed with how quickly it arrived. The colors are bright and super shimmery. I had to order one for my sister after she saw it. One night i went out and forgot to use a primer on my lids but it held up very well.</li>
    <li> The color goes on very well and it blends well. The colors are either matte or have shimmer or glitter in them, which makes those perfect for going out. All the colors are very bright and fun. And it stays for a long period of time. Definitely worth buying.</li>
    <li> Pros: The colors are great as their pigmentation, so it&#x27;s a great product for the price.   Cons: the case is big for me, so i have to invest in a new makeup bag, and i hope not to have problem with the purse. Other thing is that when you apply the shadow in the eyes, the sparkles fell all over your face and it&#x27;s a little difficult to remove them.    Check very well the description of the product. I was interested in bold shadows for the day, and i didn;t remind the \\&quot;neon vivid colors\\&quot; so i have to use this one very for the day.</li>
    <li> I love the 40 palette, i sort of wish there was a bigger variety of colors  within the palette but hey,Im still very happy with what i got for the price that i paid for it. The colors are gorgeous and they don&#x27;t flake much and alot of the residue doesn&#x27;t fall all over my face! i would recommend this product to a friend</li>
    <li> Shadows r really pigmented &amp; lots of colors to pick from. It has glitter so its good to wear day or night. &amp; the price is unbeatable! :)</li>
    <li> im a make up artist for a well known cosmetics and i was tired of not having good colors and intesity and i tried this kit for myself and its the best ever...thanks FASH i will be buying more soon...</li>
    <li> I received my palette on the exact day it was set to be delivered and I loved it! Based on the other reviews it was what I expected and MORE. I compared the gold color to Amber Lights by M.A.C. and they were just about the same. It was inexpensive compared to what i&#x27;m used to paying for makeup and I probably would&#x27;ve paid a little more for it. I can&#x27;t wait to experiment with the other colors. Great for people wanting to learn about eyeshadow and how to wear the different colors. I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I used this with and without a primer and of course it does look a little better with primer but I also wear these colors without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are very bright and colorful and I don&#x27;t use all of the colors.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fun but not for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I am a coloured women and have been using this regularly for the past two months. I holds up just the same as Hip by l&#x27;oreal. Actually i prefer this brand for everyday use. The only problem is that it is&#x27;s to soft. the colours break when you are applying. you just have to be a tad bit more careful when using the applicator. These colours are very vibrant. This is a very good price. The compliment keep reeling in. this is definetly a keeper.</li>
    <li> I love the colors in this palette. I was very impressed with the quality especially for the price. I work in a restaurant and at the end of the night my eyeshadow and eyeliner usually crease and look really gross but the last 2 nights not once have I had any creasing going on. The color goes on real smooth and nice and shiny!! Needless to say I am in LOVE~!</li>
    <li> This Palette Is Very High Quality I LOVE IT! I Pretty Much Use It Everyday :)The Colors Are So Beautiful</li>
    <li> I ordered this palette about a week or so ago...got it in 2 days with no problems or broken colors. I&#x27;m a black woman, so I was a little nervous about the colors and them not showing up, especially with the price. But boy was I wrong! All the colors (Except the row of yellow-ish shades) show up very well without much effort. I will definitely recommend to a friend and purchase again!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of trouble finding eyeshadow that will make it through the day. This one does! I would compare it to MAC quality. I have since thrown out all my other eyeshadows and will only order this from now on. Great price, great quality.</li>
    <li> I was surprised by the quality I received with this pallet considering I payed such a great price. I bought one for me and one for my sister last week and the set is beautiful. The colors are so nicely picked up by the brushes and evenly spread on the eyes.  The set has just about the perfect variety of colors needed for any outfit.  I absolutely love it!!!  I can&#x27;t stress how good the price is for the quality and how much stores out there rip people off.  I hope you guys continue to sell this with more colors as I don&#x27;t ever plan on getting elsewhere!!!  Thanks for selling a great product.  P.S. I also brought the 3pc brush set from FASH which has wonderful synthetic hair and also love it!  http://www.amazon.com/FASH-Brush-Set-5pc-Black/dp/B003ENF4X8/ref&#x3D;pd_ys_iyr4  JG.</li>
    <li> I love makeup, but I also like saving money. So when I saw this palette and then the price for said palette, I was elated. When I ordered this product, I mainly looked at the colors and the reviews. I also googled the company that creates this palette, then I place my order. However, when I went back to look at the product, in Amazon&#x27;s product description, it stated that this was a shimmer palette. I&#x27;m a little miffed, but this is mainly my fault because I really should have read it more in-depth. However, they really should include \\&quot;shimmer\\&quot; in the product name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On shipping, I would like to say that it was well packed, but I did have one eyeshadow pot sort of break, but it was not a big enough deal, for me, to ship it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the eyeshadow themselves, I really like them, but I wish that they weren&#x27;t so sparkly. They stay on all day even without eye-primer . The colors, despite being sparkly, are very intense.They are easy to spread with a brush and not a lot of residue comes off the brush, so no little specks of eyeshadow all over my face. One of the things I don&#x27;t like is the fact that there are way too many pinks and reds. If anything, this should be called the \\&quot;shimmery pink and red palette\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product but I feel a little cheated because it was shimmery and I wanted just color. But since it was my fault that I didn&#x27;t read \\&quot;shimmer\\&quot;, I give this 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I loved this product. The colors are great and highly pigmented. However, when the product arrived at my house many of the eye shadows had spilled, probably due to rough handling in the shipping process. I would definitely be careful when ordering eyeshadows online again.</li>
    <li> Item was completely broken when I received it, packaging was not enough to keep the item in place. returned and refunded.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my friend as a gift. She is very happy with it..She uses all the colors since they are very usable and not very shiny!</li>
    <li> My daughter loved her Christmas gift! The colors are so beautiful she doesn&#x27;t want to use them, so she&#x27;s saving them to admire instead! A+</li>
    <li> thank you for the rapid delivery I  love it</li>
    <li> I like the palette&lt;br /&gt;The makeup doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty easy to use&lt;br /&gt;I wish some of it did not break via shipping&lt;br /&gt;Pretty HIP for something so inexpensive.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as highly pigmented as I was expecting but I like REALLY high pigmented bright colors. I had to use a lot and even brake up the colors a little with my makeup brush to loosen and apply better. Doesn&#x27;t stay on all day either.</li>
    <li> the colour is shinning ,look the make up so good</li>
    <li> I like a few didnt think that i would like the product all that much but they are very beautiful colors and the shimmer is amazing.. I love the way that it glides on to the lid and the way the color stands out .. I will have to wait until the end of the work day to see how it stands up to my eyelids they are a little sweaty at the end of the day and colors don&#x27;t usually last ...but so far so good on log lasting color I do recommend and don&#x27;t worry about the price</li>
    <li> Well first off it is really neat to have it so slim. Secondly, when I opened it, all the people around me went \\&quot;oooooohhhh!\\&quot;. I think that right there is enough for a review. ha. But I really love the variety of colors and that they shimmer. I&#x27;ve been looking for color and I found it. The only downfall is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a brush. I am always in need of eyebrushes, so that was a let down, but still a great product nonetheless :D</li>
    <li> The Fash 40 color Shimmer eyeshadow palette is very beautiful and pigmented. The shimmer is very nice but not to over the top. The palette is good for more natural looks or very vibrant night out looks. Overall I am very happy with my purchase and I can see myself purchasing more fash products. Thanks</li>
    <li> I was leery about getting this because i never heard of the brand but i was happy when i received it to find the colors are fabulous and the range of color was very impressive. With an good primer the colors popped and shimmered beautifully. Price was awesome and quality was great.</li>
    <li> I love the shiny and shimmering colors!</li>
    <li> I love this product it shipped on time and nothing was broken beautiful colors they look shimmery and feel like silk or satin when you put them on i love to use eye primer with any eyeshadow product it helps the color show more on your skin and keeps it in place. i have used coastal scents,bh cosmetics and other brands and this is the first time ive tried fash its great you wont regret the purchase the  price is great for this product too.</li>
    <li> It came to me with all eyeshadow intact, and the product was in a box, in bubblewrap, in more bubblewrap, in a another! I guess thats the way to go! Colors aren&#x27;t super pigmented, but they are great and apply nicely!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit difficult for me to fathom why a female cosmetic box, especially eye makeup, would come without a mirror. I did read the reviews before purchasing this item, but no mention was made of there being no mirror. The colours are just ok; not quite what I was expecting, but ok, nonetheless.</li>
    <li> Ok this is straight talk...firstly, i love it ah mean REALLY LOVE IT and im thinking of purchasing another one...however, the packaging needs to done in a better manner...why? simply when i open the box a few of the shades was broken up, very messy...if you guys fixed the bubble wrap with a lil adhesive tape the item will not bounce around to the point of the product have to lost or crumble.  So please address this issue.</li>
    <li> This palette is pretty I like all the colors and they go on nicely... however the only thing I am concerned about is that it contents alot of Talc in the ingredients.</li>
    <li> I am totally an eyeshadow person, and I love the colors in this palette! Only down side is that some go on a little too lightly for my taste. Still an awesome product though :)</li>
    <li> HELLO!&lt;br /&gt;  I chose this rating because of the fact I liked that what you see is what you get. For example, I was very curious an kinda worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be what I wanted, but in the end it was exactly what I was expecting! I love the palette, the colors, the pigmentation, and a little goes along way(: I just loveee it and will buy again from this company !! I recommend it to anybody who like eyeshadows and various colors of them (:</li>
    <li> Very pigmented but not very good quality</li>
    <li> decent pigmentation, works as wet/dry. Two of the shadows were broken, and kind of got all over the place. Not exactly happy about that.</li>
    <li> good product and great variety of colors if you are into experimenting.</li>
    <li> 15/40 colors are broken very sad i vas heart broken !!! i will be returning this FASH Eyeshadows 40 color Palette and getting my money back!!!</li>
    <li> This item is awesome I got this for my best friend and she loved it so now I am going to but it for myself the eyeshadow does fall out a lot and it stains But It&#x27;s alright it would be perfect for Halloween or something it&#x27;s hard to get off tooI wish I could give it 2 and a half stars</li>
