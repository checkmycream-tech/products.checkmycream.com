      <li>satin is a good word to describe it.</li>

      <li>but this really gives you the best of both worlds by moisturizing and giving you the shiny look.  </li>
      <li>it Seems quite nice</li>
      <li>Its good for protecting lips that are already smooth and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is very smooth.</li>
      <li>The peach is more beigy-pinky than true peach, which to me is a good thing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
      <li>My favorite lip balm.</li>
      <li>I love this chapstick.</li>
      <li>but OK, there is a slant tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Living in AZ doesn&#x27;t help, I am sure.  </li>
      <li>The product glides on smoothly and feels like carmex!  </li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>I just bought this and love it.</li>
      <li>The packaging is sleek and I like the taste better than the tube Carmex.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic lip balm!  </li>
      <li>But having really chapped lips, it&#x27;s definitely a good product to get.</li>
      <li>Great, moisturizing lip balm with a smooth and clear finish.  </li>
      <li>applicator is a swivel lipstick sort and not a crude push from the bottom cheapie you get with most lip</li>
      <li>So happy to finally have found something that works!</li>
      <li>B001KYTQ8W Carmex - Lip Moisturizing Tube, Original Balm - 0.35 Oz (3-Pack)]]</li>
      <li>I ordered 3 because I was so excited about finding this product and had to throw them all</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been a Carmex fan for years, so when I saw this new moisturizing lip balm in a nice lipgloss-style tube applicator (and with sunscreen included)</li>
      <li>True to the quality of Carmex, with adding a bit of girlie - ness.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s almost like the product is &#x27;too soft&#x27; to be in that kind of tube.</li>
      <li>It was not the same silver tube that is purchased here (and that I loved from Target, which no longer sells it).</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re just looking for a quick fix for light-chapped lips</li>
      <li>The pink and peach colors are spot on....not too dense or bright.</li>
      <li>Smooth and very unisex.</li>
      <li>Love the clear gloss.</li>
      <li>and the stick softened to the point that when I went to use it, it deformed right before me.  </li>
      <li>total effect of \\&quot;Moisture Plus\\&quot; is silky smooth and light.</li>
      <li>Very highly recommend!</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ll stick to the more traditional \\&quot;chap stick\\&quot; tube.</li>
      <li>The product works well, it&#x27;s supposed to be more moisturizing than the regular carmex and have a sunscreen as well.  </li>
      <li>I thought I&#x27;d try this tube as it&#x27;s packaged to look more like a traditional lip gloss.  </li>
      <li>The smell is much better than the original Carmex, it has a slight vanilla scent to it.</li>
      <li>It really needs to be a bit more solid (like chapstick) to function well in this packaging.</li>
      <li>This has become my favorite chapstick, I love that it has a little bit of shine, it&#x27;s pretty much the only one I use now.</li>
      <li>simply so I could get free shipping.  </li>
      <li>(but if you can find the real one in the store</li>
      <li>Not so much.</li>
      <li>A light layer clings to the lips for a while....not forever as does the regular Carmex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>though considering the side effect is super super dry lips.</li>
      <li>It is a solid form of the original tube Carmex.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll admit, i bought this mainly because of the slant tip.</li>
      <li>I chose this particular style because it look convenient, compact, and mess-free.</li>
      <li>It does not last very long - perhaps an hour at most</li>
      <li>When I could not find it where I live, I ordered online.</li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s my big issue - hence the 2 stars - it is the most expensive packaging for carmex, the tube sticks and freezes when you rotate it to get more product.  </li>
      <li>My lips are soft and never seem to crack anymore!</li>
      <li>When you roll the tube up even a little bit (like barely peeking over the top), the product spill overs the side when you apply even the slighest pressure to apply on the lips.</li>
      <li>plain satin finish goes on smoothly and is soft on the lips.</li>
      <li>I felt like it really moisturized well and didn&#x27;t make my lips feel dry when it wore off.</li>
      <li>After less than 24 hours, there is a distinct improvement and immediate relief in my sore lips.  </li>
      <li>(Note: the sheer pink and sheer peach are only currently available at a store whose name begins with \\&quot;Wall\\&quot; and ends with \\&quot;greens\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I used the standard clear.  </li>
      <li>This Carmex lip balm doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long, which is why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, but I still really like it</li>
      <li>I saw that Carmex had introduced a new product called \\&quot;Moisture Plus\\&quot; of course I was curious.</li>
      <li>I am very particular about lip balm as some do not seem to do the trick and you end up having to reapply them every few minutes.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I like carmex products.  I thought I&#x27;d try this tube as it&#x27;s packaged to look more like a traditional lip gloss.  I used the standard clear.  The product works well, it&#x27;s supposed to be more moisturizing than the regular carmex and have a sunscreen as well.  The case looks great.  The product glides on smoothly and feels like carmex!  It does not last very long - perhaps an hour at most and my lips feel drier afterwards.  Maybe that&#x27;s due to the sunscreen ingredients.  Here&#x27;s my big issue - hence the 2 stars - it is the most expensive packaging for carmex, the tube sticks and freezes when you rotate it to get more product.  In my opinion there is far less carmex in this tube than other optionsalthough the tube itself is about 5\\&quot; long there is only about 1/2\\&quot; or product in there, and I don&#x27;t think I can even access all of it with the problems of the tube seizing up.    I won&#x27;t buy this again, I&#x27;ll stick to the more traditional \\&quot;chap stick\\&quot; tube.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff. I am on my fourth tube, that is quite an accomplishment for me, I never finish my lip balms. This has saved my lips from a rough winter, and gives them a bit of shine with or without lipsticks. The smell is much better than the original Carmex, it has a slight vanilla scent to it. I hope they never discontinue this product.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Invisalign Braces for 6 months and have had chapped lips the entire time.  Some times, much worse than other times (cracked, peeling, sore!).  Living in AZ doesn&#x27;t help, I am sure.  So... I have spent a small fortune on higher end lip care and nothing has actually given me relief.  I found the Ultra Hydrating Lip Balm at my corner drug store and gave it a try.  After less than 24 hours, there is a distinct improvement and immediate relief in my sore lips.  Going to buy the colored versions and these will replace all the $20+ lip treatments I have collected.  So happy to finally have found something that works!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I had heard wonderful things about the Carmex brand. The product itself is great. I felt like it really moisturized well and didn&#x27;t make my lips feel dry when it wore off. The reason I gave two stars is because of the packaging. I chose this particular style because it look convenient, compact, and mess-free. It was compact, but convenient and mess-free? Not so much. When you roll the tube up even a little bit (like barely peeking over the top), the product spill overs the side when you apply even the slighest pressure to apply on the lips. It&#x27;s so messy! It&#x27;s almost like the product is &#x27;too soft&#x27; to be in that kind of tube. It really needs to be a bit more solid (like chapstick) to function well in this packaging.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit, i bought this mainly because of the slant tip. I don&#x27;t wear makeup, but I thought the idea of having a lipstick-looking chapstick was very cute! I has basically the same feel as regular carmex, just a lightly less cooling sensation, and I like that. Got it for $2.50 at Walmart and it keeps my lips feeling hydrated so I will definitely buy this product again!</li>
    <li> Not sure if I was sent really old products, or something entirely different, but I did not receive the Carmex Moisture Plus Ultra Hydrating Lip Balm that I purchased. It was not the same silver tube that is purchased here (and that I loved from Target, which no longer sells it). The tubes looked different and the lip balm was totally goopy and disgusting. I ordered 3 because I was so excited about finding this product and had to throw them all out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely wouldn&#x27;t order these online (but if you can find the real one in the store it&#x27;s a great product!).</li>
    <li> Saw on a youtube video decided yo buy it Seems quite nice</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Smooth and very unisex. I&#x27;m just sorry I have to buy online instead of stores where I used to get it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Carmex fan for years, so when I saw this new moisturizing lip balm in a nice lipgloss-style tube applicator (and with sunscreen included) I decided to give it a try. I like it a lot! It helps keep my lips moist and I like the satin gloss type finish that it has - not too shiny/glossy...satin is a good word to describe it. I&#x27;ve worn it alone and under lipstick.    This Carmex lip balm doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long, which is why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, but I still really like it (I just bought my second one).</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Love it!</li>
    <li> (Spoiler alert! I love Carmex! I think it is the lip balm of the Gods! Truly! I use Carmex in the little pot [[ASIN:B001AXCY6E Carmex Cold Sore Reliever and Lip Moisturizer, Jar .25 oz (7.5 g)]] and Carmex in the tube [[ASIN:B001KYTQ8W Carmex - Lip Moisturizing Tube, Original Balm - 0.35 Oz (3-Pack)]] year round).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw that Carmex had introduced a new product called \\&quot;Moisture Plus\\&quot; of course I was curious. I ran out and bought three tubes. The plain satin finish, the sheer pink tint, and the sheer peach tint. (Note: the sheer pink and sheer peach are only currently available at a store whose name begins with \\&quot;Wall\\&quot; and ends with \\&quot;greens\\&quot;. This was a relatively minor investment as the total purchase was under eight buckaroos.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tube of lip balm promises to be \\&quot;ultra hydrating\\&quot; with&lt;br /&gt;vitamin E and aloe moisturizing protection. It also contains sunscreen with a SPF of 15. Another selling point is a slant tip. I find that a slant tip is a negligible selling feature but OK, there is a slant tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plain satin finish goes on smoothly and is soft on the lips. The taste is vaguely vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator is a swivel lipstick sort and not a crude push from the bottom cheapie you get with most lip balms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color balms are transparent glazes. The pink and peach colors are spot on....not too dense or bright. Just what one would want from a tinted balm. The pink is delicate and not too light or too dark. The peach is more beigy-pinky than true peach, which to me is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The total effect of \\&quot;Moisture Plus\\&quot; is silky smooth and light. Its good for dressing up, office meetings, going out. You can&#x27;t smear it on your nostrils and cuticles as with the Carmex in a pot. Its good for protecting lips that are already smooth and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Moisture Plus\\&quot; also needs to be reapplied often. A light layer clings to the lips for a while....not forever as does the regular Carmex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I like \\&quot;Moisture Plus\\&quot;? Yes.&lt;br /&gt;Will I buy it again? Yes.&lt;br /&gt;Will it ever replace regular Carmex? No!ll it ever replace regular Carmex? No!</li>
    <li> Great, moisturizing lip balm with a smooth and clear finish.  Only downside is that I bought this on Amazon for $3.99 and then I found the same product at Walmart for $0.99.</li>
    <li> True to the quality of Carmex, with adding a bit of girlie - ness. Love the clear gloss. Has been hard to find in stores near me.</li>
    <li> I love this chapstick. It&#x27;s all I buy. However, when I ordered it there was no indication that I would receive the chapstick with a theme on the outside. What I&#x27;m saying is I received the correct chapstick but was not informed that it would have animal print (specifically cheetah) on my chapstick. I HATE animal print. Now I&#x27;m embarrassed to use it in public.</li>
    <li> My favorite lip balm. When I could not find it where I live, I ordered online. It is very smooth.</li>
    <li> I am very particular about lip balm as some do not seem to do the trick and you end up having to reapply them every few minutes.  This product, however, works for a long time.  My lips are soft and never seem to crack anymore!</li>
    <li> I bought two of these as fillers on an order a while back simply so I could get free shipping.  I will probably make the other item the filler next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a long time user of the regular Carmex product and have watched them shrink in size over the years, so when I saw that this had .75 oz vs .25 in the regular container, I jumped and bought two.  This has Sunscreen in it, the regular does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far the only negative thing that I can say about them is actually not their fault, I let one stay close to my body too long and the stick softened to the point that when I went to use it, it deformed right before me.  I learned a valuable lesson.  Take out of pocket.  Let come to room temp, then apply.</li>
    <li> Being on Accutane, regular Carmex and other chapsticks just aren&#x27;t enough. This works wonders though considering the side effect is super super dry lips. If you&#x27;re just looking for a quick fix for light-chapped lips this isn&#x27;t for you - it&#x27;s pretty heavy duty and might be a little too goopy for you. But having really chapped lips, it&#x27;s definitely a good product to get. It stays on for long periods of time without smudging off easily and even if it does, it thankfully doesn&#x27;t taste awful.</li>
    <li> I just bought this and love it. It is a solid form of the original tube Carmex. The packaging is sleek and I like the taste better than the tube Carmex.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic lip balm!  The best part about it (for you ladies out there) is that it is actually very shiny like a lip gloss but feels wonderful on your lips.  I have always hated to use lip gloss because of the stickiness but this really gives you the best of both worlds by moisturizing and giving you the shiny look.  I have tried the colored versions as well but prefer the simple clear one since it goes with any other lipstick I might want to wear or just on plain lips.  Very highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This has become my favorite chapstick, I love that it has a little bit of shine, it&#x27;s pretty much the only one I use now.</li>
