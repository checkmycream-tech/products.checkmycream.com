      <li>Leaves the skin feeling soft and scented.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This &amp;#34;lavender&amp;#34; smelled like old lady perfume.</li>
      <li>Its soft, breezy, feminine without over-powering or smelling like you fell into a scented candle.</li>
      <li>to expensive, but it does smells good</li>

    <li> I love this lavender lotion... it&#x27;s very creamy and wonderful fragrance.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like lavender at all. Like another reviewer said, it smells like old lady perfume. The scent is so far from lavender that to be honest I wonder if they put the wrong lotion in my bottle. It has a cloying rose smell that&#x27;s kind of suffocating. The texture of the lotion is quite nice, but I&#x27;m otherwise really disappointed in this purchase.</li>
    <li> This body lotion is pricey, but worth every penny! I first tried this lotion that was included as a sample and I have been a fan ever since. The rich,  non-sticky formula has a wonderful fragrance that has staying power.  I can&#x27;t wait to try Thymes&#x27; other products - I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> This is the best cream I have ever used. It works gently on my skin leaving it clean,clear and cool.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS LOTION. I got a sample for Christmas and fell in love with it. Soon after I ordered a large bottle and use it after every shower. Makes you feel fresh, warm and cozy.</li>
    <li> Thymes Body Lotion has been my favorite for years.  It was nice to get the product for less than I usually spend.  I received the product in a timely manner -- always a good thing because I usually wait to get a product when I&#x27;m almost out of it.[[ASIN:B001LF4D2Y Thymes Body Lotion, Lavender, 9.25-Ounce Bottle]]</li>
    <li> Love the Thymes line. It keeps the scent until the bottle is empty!  Leaves the skin feeling soft and scented.</li>
    <li> Beautiful scents. Have been using this for about 8 years. Have just ordered several more of their great products for gifts.</li>
    <li> This body lotion is awesome. The smell of lavender is enchanted. It is very comfortable and relaxing. The touch of it-- is luxurious and silky.</li>
    <li> Great, true lavender scent. It is so relaxing and soothing. I put it on every night before bed.  This lotion works well in our arid climate.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this stuff for C for a few years now and its always a gift hit.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> New product for me, like it so far.  Saw this product in a boutique store, way too expensive.  Sooooo, go to Amazon same product and great price...Amazon IS great.  Lovely fresh not too overwhelming fragrance and feels good on my skin.  Keep it in my purse for dry skin/hands while out shopping.  Will probably continue to buy</li>
    <li> Very nice light fragrance.</li>
    <li> I never cared for lavender finding it too strong for me. This isn&#x27;t and it smells so natural not that artificial smell many have.</li>
    <li> I ended up purchasing the Jasmine scent of this product, but I did check out the Lavender scent as well and it smells SO nice. Most lavender scents you may come across are way too strong and powdery smelling. Not this product. Its not your typical lavender. Its soft, breezy, feminine without over-powering or smelling like you fell into a scented candle. :) I am totally getting this scent next time.</li>
    <li> This is a third order of the same body lotion as a gift for my sweetheart.  It is an eternal opportunity!</li>
    <li> Love this product! It has nice thick consistency and a little goes a long way. Lovely scent as well. I also purchased the shower gel. Great products at a great price. Would make a nice gift as well.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t bother my husbands sensitive nose. I want to sniff my hands they smell so good. Really.</li>
    <li> Love how my skin feels after using this lotion. Quality is awesome.It is just slightly to perfume-y for me BUT it&#x27;s because it is lavender and I can only handle little amounts of that smell. So if you like lavender then you will probably love this lotion.</li>
    <li> This lotion is a favorite of mine when I want something sweet smelling. I use it on my legs feet and hands and my husband loves the smell.</li>
    <li> Very smooth, soft scent, many compliments, just a great all around lotion. I would recommend this not an overpowering lavender scent.</li>
    <li> This is a product I use daily. The scent of lavender is perfectly balanced. I only hope they don&#x27;t change the formula!</li>
    <li> I finally found the lavender lotion I wanted. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion thinking with the reviews that it would be great. However, I learned my lesson purchasing a fragrance that I&#x27;ve never smelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This &amp;#34;lavender&amp;#34; smelled like old lady perfume. It was one of the worst smelling lavender scents I&#x27;ve ever experienced. It should be named &amp;#34;rose&amp;#34; or something similar. If you like authentic lavender scent, go somewhere else, as this is not what you&#x27;re looking for. It&#x27;s overpowering and just gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never purchase this again.</li>
    <li> to expensive, but it does smells good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve smelled and tried hundreds of Lavender lotions (I never pass up a free sample!). This the best one. Totally worth the price.</li>
    <li> I use Thymes body lotion all the time.  The fragrance is light and lovely; the lotion feels good and moisturizes my skin.  I will order again from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance of Thymes Body Lotion.</li>
    <li> I live in Colorado where the air is really dry.  I am constantly putting on body lotion.  Thymes Lavender is so soothing and calming to my skin, it&#x27;s effects last all day long and the soft scent of lavender stays with me too.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> love the smell and texture; calming effect</li>
    <li> It absorbs quickly and moisturizes well.  I wish it had just a bit stronger fragrance, but I love the fragrance anyway.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. Great fragrance and very moisturizing. I enjoy its calming fragrance especially in the evening after showering. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Not as strong of a lavender scent that I would like, but a very nice scent.....very emollient and I would purchase again.</li>
