      <li>Tastes good, easy to use, affordable and effective.</li>
      <li>Work well and are very strong.</li>
      <li>This the is best product I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
      <li>I have used this product before and it is the best whitener on the marked.</li>
      <li>My teeth are overcrowded, I love coffee, and I used to smoke.  </li>
      <li>I could not be more satisfied.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>This product works, I was using the toothpaste with no results, I tried the strips and they were ok.  </li>
      <li>Just make sure not to get the stuff on your gums.</li>
      <li>Overall, I am very happy with the product, the value and the results.</li>
      <li>Says it works much better than anything they can offer.</li>
      <li>I have used these before with outstanding results.</li>
      <li>Very tidy application, taste is pleasing, fast, painless and you can literally see results after one use.  </li>
      <li>So far ... so good!  </li>
      <li>It was easy to use and really had great results.</li>
      <li>I would definitly purchase two kits to start, and then always keep one in your fridge for those special nights out!  :)</li>
      <li>I originally bought this product from my dentist, for more than twice what Amazon charges.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>The trays are easy to use and did not cause me any sensitivity.</li>
      <li>The tray easily fits over your teeth and whitens between your teeth -- not just the front.  </li>
      <li>Having used older products from Treswhite, I can say that these are the best of their line by far!</li>
      <li>I am constantly getting comments from people saying how beautiful my teeth are.  </li>
      <li>I smile more than I used to.  </li>
      <li>The tray now sits comfortably on your teeth.</li>
      <li>I bought them as a gift, because the person I bought them for always spit out the permanent trays at night and she has ADD so these were great because she only had to use them for 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Use rolled tissues or paper towels to keep gums free of gel.</li>
      <li>The trays come pre filled with the whitener and are disposed of after treatment.</li>
      <li>This product is amazing, and I highly recommend it if you are looking to achieve fab teeth.  </li>
      <li>Because of this fitting issue, we find that the new Opalescence 15% Go suits our needs rather better.  </li>
      <li>The semi ridged tray, higher % provided better and easier whitening.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the whitestrips to originally whiten my teeth when they came out forever ago.</li>
      <li>And if I felt the familiar thingle of whitening gel, Injust wiped it off.</li>
      <li>I have used Crest whitestrips before and they are so much more convenient and honestly gave me the same result.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need to leave these in for very long to see results, they are very effective.</li>
      <li>Ok delivered fast and it seems to work, I just don&#x27;t like the taste</li>
      <li>It works quickly.</li>
      <li>So, take your choice -- both products are worthy.  </li>
      <li>Have tried other products and this is by far the best on the narket.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, easy to order and what a white smile!</li>
      <li>I was super happy to find it on Amazon for half the price AND no trip to the dentist!  </li>
      <li>Some people&#x27;s gums or teeth are more sensitive than others.</li>
      <li>I just use one once in a while to brighten my smile.</li>
      <li>These strips are much more potent than the standard grocery store strips and are also much easier to apply to your teeth.</li>
      <li>I switched from the old formula to the 15% and find it a lot easier to use because of more reasonable time commitment.</li>
      <li>Easy, quick and white teeth.</li>
      <li>Used them for 10 days on top teeth only, no change at all.</li>
      <li>It works so much better than a store bought Crest white strips and gets more of the back teeth instead if the 4 front ones</li>
      <li>First time using a teeth whitening system.  </li>
      <li>I could see the difference after the first</li>
      <li>While I wouldn&#x27;t say my teeth are actor-white, they are definitely noticeably better than they have been in years.  </li>
      <li>At the time, I thought it was well worth it because it really did the job.  </li>
      <li>I have much better luck keeping it in place on my upper teeth than I do on my lower teeth.  </li>
      <li>The first time I used them, I stuck them on my teeth and sucked in, like the directions told me to.</li>
      <li>and I will be buying more in the future from this seller.</li>
      <li>this is my first time using the 15% version and its great that it only requires 15 min, but they do make my teeth a bit more sensitive for a few days.</li>
      <li>Not a Dramatic Difference but still  difference</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this particular whitening product.</li>
      <li>Whitens really well.  </li>
      <li>Really whitens teeth fast.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for my teeth...</li>
      <li>Cons: these really irritated my gums.  </li>
      <li>And after those two applications I came straight to amazon to buy the 10 pack.</li>
      <li>It is fast and convenient.</li>
      <li>Pros: they really do seem to work.</li>
      <li>I thought you would keep the trays on the whole time, but the trays are just used for getting the liners on your teeth.</li>
      <li>My caviat concerns the fact that Supreme&#x27;s delivery method, while nicely snug-fitting, doesn&#x27;t allow the actual product to fully reach the gumline from a tooth&#x27;s front to its back (lingual) side.  </li>
      <li>Better than other products out there or at the dental office.</li>
      <li>I was able to tolerate it while wearing them the first 2 times, but the next day when I tried to wear my next tray my gums were so irritated I couldn&#x27;t make it through the 15 minutes.  </li>
      <li>Only downside is that they make your teeth more sensitive than the less potent strips, and do bleach out your gums if you get any peroxide gel on them.</li>
      <li>Initially he bleached only the top, but the difference became so obvious that we ordered more to complete the bottom.</li>

    <li> We&#x27;ve always preferred Opalescence products, and this Trewhite Supreme 15% is quite good.  My caviat concerns the fact that Supreme&#x27;s delivery method, while nicely snug-fitting, doesn&#x27;t allow the actual product to fully reach the gumline from a tooth&#x27;s front to its back (lingual) side.  Because of this fitting issue, we find that the new Opalescence 15% Go suits our needs rather better.  So, take your choice -- both products are worthy.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> No change at all, waste of money. Used them for 10 days on top teeth only, no change at all.</li>
    <li> Works well for brightening teeth.</li>
    <li> Had used the 10% and loved it.  This 15% solution burned and I couldn&#x27;t get it out fast enough!</li>
    <li> Having used older products from Treswhite, I can say that these are the best of their line by far! The semi ridged tray, higher % provided better and easier whitening. For those curious I bought in January 2015 and my trays expiration date is April 2016.</li>
    <li> i love this product!! it whiten my teeth in only 6 trays! so i have enough to touch up my teeth later!!!</li>
    <li> As someone who drinks a ton of tea, my teeth have been slowly turning more and more yellow for a few years. These strips are much more potent than the standard grocery store strips and are also much easier to apply to your teeth. Because of how they&#x27;re applied, they also seem to stay on much easier (the easiest way to keep them on, in my experience, is actually to keep the trays in if that doesn&#x27;t bother you). Only downside is that they make your teeth more sensitive than the less potent strips, and do bleach out your gums if you get any peroxide gel on them. Doesn&#x27;t bother me though. 5/5.</li>
    <li> Do Not buy these! You will be very disappointed if you do. I bought these on a recommendation from my brother and man do I wish I had just gotten some regular Crest whitestrips. So here&#x27;s why my husband and I hated it...The trays only cover the same area that whitestrips do. I had gotten these thinking that they would go farther back and that wasn&#x27;t the case. The worst part about it was that the entire time we wore these, we felt the need to spit about every minute...for 15 minutes or something!! Ugh. It was so frustrating. I have used Crest whitestrips before and they are so much more convenient and honestly gave me the same result.</li>
    <li> Not a Dramatic Difference but still  difference, i cant complain, and No it did NOT burn what so ever for me, yet i did use a gum therapy weeks before using this to strengthen my gums</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for whitening teeth.  The tray easily fits over your teeth and whitens between your teeth -- not just the front.  It is fast and convenient.</li>
    <li> Excellent Seller! Great product and I will be buying more in the future from this seller. Teeth were white as snow within 3 days ( 6 uses one in AM and one in PM ) only needed them in for 15 minutes although it said 30. Will never spend $100 at the dentist again on their whiteners.</li>
    <li> I purchased these trays to use before my upcoming wedding.  Pros: they really do seem to work. I noticed improvement immediately. Cons: these really irritated my gums.  The liners cover my gums and the gel caused them to burn pretty badly. I was able to tolerate it while wearing them the first 2 times, but the next day when I tried to wear my next tray my gums were so irritated I couldn&#x27;t make it through the 15 minutes.  We  actually gave up using these after a few trays because of the pain.  Also, I don&#x27;t care for how these liners are applied. I thought you would keep the trays on the whole time, but the trays are just used for getting the liners on your teeth. Once applied, the trays are removed and they work similar to Whitestrips, except the liners cover too much of my gums and there is too much gel on them.  The gel is a bit messy.  Finally, the fact that they have to be refridgerated is somewhat inconvenient. I like to have them in my bathroom so i remember to use them. With these, you have to pull them out in advance and allow them to warm to room temperature. That involves a little bit of planning ahead.  Given all these cons, I prefer Whitestrips as they are easier to use and don&#x27;t cause me any pain.</li>
    <li> This product exceeded my expectations in just 2 uses. I would recommend it for anyone who would like whiter teeth.</li>
    <li> I saw the biggest results with the first use which I expected. There was some gum sensitivity initially but not extreme. Over all, good results.</li>
    <li> Use this product every few years.  Whitens really well.  My dentist keeps asking what I&#x27;m using.  Says it works much better than anything they can offer.</li>
    <li> I have used these before with outstanding results. I used the green top product from my Dentists office. Freshness is an issue with this product, so be careful. I have used all trays except one, over the past week or two. They have worked, but I had better results with them in the past.</li>
    <li> Excellent &amp;iacute;tem</li>
    <li> Tastes good, easy to use, affordable and effective. Better than other products out there or at the dental office. Trust me, I know my stuff, I work at a dental office.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and it is the best whitener on the marked. My order was received unexpired as requested. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product ... We guarantee 100%&lt;br /&gt;I have had no fault with the product purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;recommended,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Regards&lt;br /&gt;J D</li>
    <li> I originally bought this product from my dentist, for more than twice what Amazon charges.  My teeth are overcrowded, I love coffee, and I used to smoke.  None of these have done me any favors in helping to keep my teeth white.  After seeing a group photo of myself, I decided I had to try something, and bought this kit from my dentist.  It made a much bigger difference than I expected.  While I wouldn&#x27;t say my teeth are actor-white, they are definitely noticeably better than they have been in years.  I now buy the trays to use sporadically to keep them where they are.  The one thing I would change about them is the inner tray.  It is like trying to keep saran wrap still on your teeth.  I have much better luck keeping it in place on my upper teeth than I do on my lower teeth.  The company also makes a toothpaste that I have found helpful in maintaining the shade.</li>
    <li> sometimes the inner retainer with the peroxide would not fit onto the teeth and you would get a mouthful of the peroxide</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my teeth...</li>
    <li> did not see any noticeable difference in my teeth</li>
    <li> All I can say is i love it! Easy to use, easy to order and what a white smile! Great buy!</li>
    <li> These are definitely an upgrade from the previous product. The tray now sits comfortably on your teeth. The previous ones, were flimsy tape versions that didn&#x27;t fit well and moved during the wear period. The new version keeps the cleaner on your teeth without spilling over to your gums, which is very uncomfortable and irritates the to the point where you cannot wear them on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> Totally amazing product! Love it! Really whitens teeth fast. Just make sure not to get the stuff on your gums.</li>
    <li> These definitely work and get your teeth whiter.  this is my first time using the 15% version and its great that it only requires 15 min, but they do make my teeth a bit more sensitive for a few days.</li>
    <li> Work well and are very strong. You don&#x27;t need to leave these in for very long to see results, they are very effective. Would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Never saw any major improvements but i believe it does work a bit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Cons&lt;br /&gt;It reallllyy makes your teeth and gums tender.&lt;br /&gt;Doesnt cover all your teeth and the fluid sometimes escapes the plastic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had permanent tetracycline stains even before all of my baby teeth popped out.  This is the ONLY product that has worked and has made my teeth SO much brighter!  It&#x27;s great to find something that works SO well.  I smile more than I used to.  I use the 15% because it&#x27;s not too strong, and if I tried a whitening product with less than 15% it wouldn&#x27;t have any effect.  I love this!</li>
    <li> it works for me I drink a lot of coffee and a smoke</li>
    <li> Every person&#x27;s teeth bleach differently, but I can tell you that for my son, this product did the trick.  Initially he bleached only the top, but the difference became so obvious that we ordered more to complete the bottom. The product does what it says, just realize that this product gives mixed results to different people depending on the types of stains you have.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the whitestrips to originally whiten my teeth when they came out forever ago. I would use them once every 12-18 months but hated how long it took to use them and how sensitive they made my teeth for a couple weeks afterwards. I was introduced to these by my sister-in-law who is a dental hygienist. I just use one once in a while to brighten my smile. It&#x27;s only 15 min and doesn&#x27;t taste all that bad. Sometimes my teeth are a little sensitive to them or if I had just flossed my teeth, they&#x27;ll make my gums burn like crazy and turn them a little white in small areas. Don&#x27;t fret, it goes away! I saw on a few reviews that some people were using them every day. My sis told me to NEVER do that!! These babies are professional grade and you&#x27;ll want to wait a couple days in between applications.</li>
    <li> My hygienist recommended Opalesence Treswhite to me, rather than a $500 bleaching treatment. The trays are easy to use and did not cause me any sensitivity. I used 5 of the 10 trays over about a month. Although my teeth are not stained to begin with, you could see the difference after just one or two treatments. I plan to save the other 5 trays and use as needed to brighten the teeth up again. Overall, I am very happy with the product, the value and the results.</li>
    <li> Ok delivered fast and it seems to work, I just don&#x27;t like the taste</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended these, and I paid $100 for the kit in the office.  After just a few applications I really started to notice a difference, so I came online an found them for half the price.  I am just finishing my second kit.....I use about two trays a week, and my teeth have never been whiter!!! I am constantly getting comments from people saying how beautiful my teeth are.  I just went into the dentist yesterday to have a filling done, and they told me I have the whitest naturally colored teeth they offer as far as filling color.  I have always wated movie star white teeth, so I just ordered my third kit, to keep going.  Like I said, I use about two trays a week, and i leave them in for between 30-60 min.  I haven&#x27;t had any issue with any terrible sensitivity.  This product is amazing, and I highly recommend it if you are looking to achieve fab teeth.  I would definitly purchase two kits to start, and then always keep one in your fridge for those special nights out!  :)</li>
    <li> This did cause me some tooth sensitivity so I try to use it at night which seems to help. I don&#x27;t notice a change after 4 sets so I am losing motivation to continue using it. Maybe I am just not a good candidate for tooth whitening though since I also don&#x27;t remember a change with white strips.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my dentist over five years ago.  He charged me over $100 for it.  At the time, I thought it was well worth it because it really did the job.  Not only that, it was cheaper and easier than getting custom trays or laser treatments. I was looking in the mirror a few weeks ago and decided it was time for a touch up. I was super happy to find it on Amazon for half the price AND no trip to the dentist!  So far ... so good!  I could see the difference after the first application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does sting your gums a bit, so I just alternate between my upper and lower teeth or just skip a day.</li>
    <li> Works great! But after about 4 days your gums will get extremely soar. My gums also bleached white for a couple hours but went back to normal.</li>
    <li> This product works, I was using the toothpaste with no results, I tried the strips and they were ok.  These trays are the best!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It&#x27;s the same whitener I&#x27;ve  bought from my dentist but for half the cost! This is the only whitener that doesn&#x27;t  hurt my gums and it does not make my teeth sensitive as other over the counter products have done.  I drink a lot of coffee so use the whitener about 3 times a year.</li>
    <li> These didn&#x27;t work for me - my teeth are no whiter.  I bought them from the dentist .. at about the same price here $50.  I had lost a shade or two in the few years since I last did Whitestrips, wanted a little brightening pop so bought these and I didn&#x27;t get it.  These are easier to use than Whitestrips with the pop off trays but the thick gel dripping down your throat for 1/2 hour is disgusting.  I forgot about them being on once and probably left them for over an hour (25-30 minutes is recommended), got sore gums and teeth but still no whitening.  Cannot recommend.    One other thing - the package says refrigeration is required.  Mine were not refrigerated when I bought them and I didn&#x27;t keep them in the fridge.  Maybe this made a difference in their effectivness, I don&#x27;t know, but I think the refrigeration is linked to the expiration date.  The shelf life is lower without refrigeration, although mine were over a year from expiration when I used them and they still didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> First time using a teeth whitening system.  This one is great!  My gums were a little sensitive when the tray was in but the sensitivity quickly dissipated.</li>
    <li> I work at a dental office that offers this whitening system to our patients.  They love it!  I can&#x27;t wait to try it myself!</li>
    <li> Very happy when I used 10 years ago, and using again today. It is still a great quality whitening system.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Teeth feel cleaner. Product does clump toward end of use time. This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this particular whitening product.</li>
    <li> My dentist introduced me to this product. It is easy to use and works great!! The trays come pre filled with the whitener and are disposed of after treatment. I usually wear the trays for 1-2 hours. Your individual sensitivity to the whitening compound will determine how long you can keep them in. Some people&#x27;s gums or teeth are more sensitive than others. After the initial whitening regiment directed on the box, I use the trays once a month to maintain whiteness. I&#x27;ve purchased this multipack several times and have introduced it to several of my friends in lieu of the expense of a dental office whitening procedure.</li>
    <li> Exact same product I buy at my dentist - but not anymore. I will continue to buy through Amazon. The whitening trays work fast and you don&#x27;t have to keep them in your mouth as long as over the counter trays. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Best home bleach kit you can use.  Very tidy application, taste is pleasing, fast, painless and you can literally see results after one use.  I use to touch up and begote events where I will be photographed.</li>
    <li> Not as expected. Whitening Strips work just as well.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my upcoming wedding. The first time I used them, I stuck them on my teeth and sucked in, like the directions told me to. The whitening gel got all over my gums and burned them (think what it feels like when you burn your mouth on a slice of pizza... times 10). I was ready to give up, after giving my gums several days to heal. But after reading other people&#x27;s reviews, I just stuck them on my teeth and very very gently suck in, just enough that they stuck. And if I felt the familiar thingle of whitening gel, Injust wiped it off. 15 minutes later and my teeth were a shade whiter and my gum tissue was still intact!</li>
    <li> These have worked great. I bought a couple at my dentist&#x27;s office to test them. And after those two applications I came straight to amazon to buy the 10 pack. I bought them as a gift, because the person I bought them for always spit out the permanent trays at night and she has ADD so these were great because she only had to use them for 15 minutes. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought these instead of the Crest White strips I usually get. It was easy to use and really had great results. If, however, you have really sensitive teeth, these might make your teeth hurt for a day or two.</li>
    <li> It works so much better than a store bought Crest white strips and gets more of the back teeth instead if the 4 front ones</li>
    <li> I have to agree with other reviewers that this does irritate my gums if I use it two nights in a row. If I&#x27;m careful not to use it to often, though, it&#x27;s a terrific product. Usually takes 2 - 3 applications before my teeth are visibly whiter. I switched from the old formula to the 15% and find it a lot easier to use because of more reasonable time commitment. Have ordered twice already and will order again.</li>
    <li> Great product will be using it again and again.  Have tried other products and this is by far the best on the narket.</li>
    <li> Easy, quick and white teeth. Love this product. Used it while I showered and brushed when I finished. All good.</li>
    <li> Paid over twice the price for Treswhite at my dentist office.  This the is best product I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
    <li> I started using this product for while curtousey of my dentist. Use vitamin E oil on your gums to prevent burning. This product works awesome!!!</li>
    <li> Preparing for a wedding just a few months away, I was miserable at the thought of shelling out $400 or more for in-office teeth whitening. I researched home treatments extensively and nervously settled on Opalescence 15%. I could not be more satisfied. It works quickly. I&#x27;d suggest doing the treatments at least a day apart, as I found I did make my teeth/gums a bit sensitive -- and the treatment does burn if you get it on your gums (and turns them white). Use rolled tissues or paper towels to keep gums free of gel.</li>
