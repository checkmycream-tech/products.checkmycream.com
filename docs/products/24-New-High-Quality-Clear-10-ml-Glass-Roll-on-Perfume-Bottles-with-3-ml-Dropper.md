<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great for my Essential oils!</li>
    <li> Getting 1 star because I have to give a rating to post. 2 bottles were completely shattered, glass is very low quality and looks dirty.</li>
    <li> The roller ball only seems to want to put out oil about half of the time. I sometimes have to use my finger nail or press really hard to get the ball to start rolling!</li>
    <li> Perfect size for making essential oil roller blends of slightly bigger quantity.  Rollers glide easily.  Nice that some plastic droppers are included too.</li>
    <li> worst rollers I&#x27;ve gotten! The balls do not roll!</li>
    <li> Works just as advertised.</li>
    <li> Will be back to buy more!</li>
    <li> Some bottles were cracked or had chips on them</li>
    <li> great value and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> The plastic roller balls keep falling out of the rollers. Once I realized this, I keep an eye on it when I am using it and am able to push it back in if it falls out. I&#x27;m using these for essential oil blends, so I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s the issue or why these are doing this, but I&#x27;ve had it happen on 3 of them now.</li>
    <li> Great for mixing essential oils.</li>
    <li> good quality fast delivery.  no problems with the balls getting stuck.</li>
    <li> It came in fast and is exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Got it in the mail very quickly but the roller balls don&#x27;t roll at all. Would not buy this again even for the low price.</li>
    <li> Perfect for essential oils</li>
    <li> These are great. Only problem is one of them leaked. I looked to see if the roller was on tight and it looked like it was.</li>
    <li> I am a mom of 5 and an avid essential oiler. I have bought several roller bottle fr different sites, but I love these. The price and quality of these roller bottle can&#x27;t be beat!  All my kids have at least one of these roller bottles in their pockets at all times.  We love our Vivaex roller bottles!</li>
    <li> I had 4 bottles break when putting in the plastic roller. :/</li>
    <li> love these but i ordered them and the small ones but nevered recieved little ones just 2 cases of the large</li>
    <li> The bottles were easy to fill, however, the roller balls don&#x27;t roll very well.</li>
    <li> These bottles are quite awful. They don&#x27;t roll and if you lucky enough that one does roll it&#x27;s rough. Please save you money and go a different route.</li>
    <li> I received these yesterday and couldn&#x27;t wait to start filling them with all the wonderful essential oil blends I have been reading about. I filled two right away and was disappointed when I tried them out that the rollers wouldn&#x27;t roll. It was like they were stuck in one position. I messed around and finally got one to roll a little by pushing on it pretty hard but I couldn&#x27;t get the other one to roller at all. I checked the other tops and all have issues. Most wont roll at all. These are completely useless to me.</li>
    <li> Very handy for the unbeatable price. I only wish the rollers worked better. Its very hard to get the liquid to roll out of the bottle which is great for no spilling but not great if you actually want to use the product you put in the bottle as a roll on. I did find that if you push the roller ball down very firmly on a hard surface it seems to give the roller ball more room allowing for a small amount of liquid to come through when rolled. So fill, fix the roller in place then press firmly on a hard surface and you are good to go!</li>
    <li> some rollers did  not work.  Overall good price for what does work/</li>
    <li> My glass bottles were clean and everything was packaged nicely, but the lids didn&#x27;t fit well at all. It was like a puzzle trying to find a bottle and lid that would screw on together half way decent.</li>
    <li> I ordered these bottles along with the 12 short ones but only received 20 roller balls.  The other bottles are worthless without the roller balls</li>
    <li> balls don&#x27;t roll, they are cheap and it shows. won&#x27;t purchase again. I got them for essential oils, cannot get anything out, not worth the money</li>
    <li> Not very happy with these. I made a few oil blends and the roller balls fall right out. Bummer. Won&#x27;t order these again.</li>
    <li> great price,fast delivery</li>
    <li> Excellent price, the rollerballs roll well, no issues with getting clogged. They are easy to fill and cap with roller ball, and you can uncap with minimal difficulty to reuse. I plan to purchase again!</li>
    <li> The rollerballs do not even work! I missed the return window, this was a complete waste of money. I should have read all the poor reviews before purchasing.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite.</li>
    <li> They were advertised and described as the 10mL bottles and even on the box it said they were the 10mL bottles (well the sticker on the box anyways) but they were all the 5mL bottles which was disappointing. but not enough of a problem to go through the hassle of shipping it back for an exchange.</li>
    <li> These are great if you&#x27;re using quickly but if it&#x27;s not darkened glass...certain oils oxidize quicker I think:/</li>
    <li> 6 bottle caps missing</li>
    <li> The rollarball portion of this product is NOT good.  Very little oil comes thru if at all.  Very frustrating!!!</li>
    <li> excellent quality, highly recommended, is the second time that I buy and easy to use</li>
    <li> I would not recommend these bottles.  The rollers are plastic and will not roll.  I put oil on the roller and tried to lubricate it enough to roll.  Very poor quality.  I really wanted these to be great, but very disappointed.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Much better quality.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> roll nice. havent had any problems with them leaking</li>
    <li> The bottles were clean and well packaged when I received them. Everything went in very easily, BUT my complaint is that the balls fall out ALL the time!  I will move on to another product when I&#x27;m through these (bc I don&#x27;t want to waste them) but I&#x27;m disappointed that I have to be on alert every time I use it so I don&#x27;t lose the ball. Yes, stores diluted oils very well, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use them for the long-haul. Waste of money! two stars only because they came clean and in one piece, which is something I didn&#x27;t realize I should be grateful for until reading the other reviews.</li>
    <li> The balls in the roller kept falling out. I shared hald of the bottles with a friend and she said the same thing.</li>
    <li> For clear roller bottles these have worked great!</li>
    <li> These worked great, however half my order got to me shattered or cracked. They just need to ship them better and then I would rate it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Met my needs and expectations.</li>
    <li> Bottles are great came exactly as stated in ad, quick shipping I am able to use these for many different applications.</li>
    <li> Very durable, easy to use</li>
    <li> bottles, tops and droppers were fine, it is the balls that are not good. I have to keep replacing the rollers because the balls keep falling out. I only get 4-5 uses out of 1 ball and those are not good odds. Not happy with the roller ball part.</li>
    <li> Nice, fast delivery, met my need.</li>
    <li> I first thought the bottles were great. However, after having several where the tops don&#x27;t screw on at all and now the majority of them have the balls fall out ... I&#x27;m left with useless bottles, no balls and lids that won&#x27;t attach.</li>
    <li> I purchased these items and was pleasantly surprised! For the price they are a great value and worked exactly for what I needed them for! (Essential Oils). I would defiantly do business with this seller again and recommend that you buy from them as well.</li>
    <li> They are pretty good, i wish they let out a little more liquid though</li>
    <li> Bottles needed to washed.  Some of the roller balls release too much liquid and other roller balls fall out when used.  I won&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
    <li> A lot of the bottles came broken and the roller barley works.</li>
    <li> Good value for the money</li>
    <li> PERFECT....love them!</li>
    <li> Awesome deal, well packaged ! Would love to see this package offered in Amber colored bottles too. I am definitely a repeat buyer.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and perfectly as described.</li>
    <li> These worked very well for making roll on&#x27;s with essential oils and carrier oils.  I had some issues with getting the roller ball tops into place and the balls were not as smooth as I would have liked them to be. a few of the balls had scratches in them and they didn&#x27;t roll properly.  The packaging was good and the bottles were in a cardboard box with the tops and balls in a separate baggy.</li>
    <li> I was worried when I read some of the reviews before my purchase, but these came shrink wrapped, boxed really well, unbroken and appear completely new. Really happy with the ones I&#x27;ve used so far!</li>
    <li> I like the size of the bottles. I&#x27;m not a fan of the roller. It seems to have a hard time rolling. I wouldn&#x27;t order these again because of the roller.</li>
    <li> Order came fast. All the bottles were packaged good, nothing was broke. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Rollers kinda suck, could be better. But good otherwise.</li>
    <li> These bottles are perfect for my EO blends. Shipping was quick with good packaging. I tested for leakage by filling with water and lying the bottle on it&#x27;s side overnight - not even a drop leaked after 2 days. Also no leakage on the oil blend I made. The rollers work well and are easy to insert. The screw on caps fit nicely. I would definitely order from this company again and recommend these roll on bottles. Great price point, too.</li>
    <li> I received product very fast but when i opened them most of the bottles where damaged (cracked or chipped). Also, the bottles where dusty on the inside. Not happy with the product and will never buy again.</li>
    <li> I use these with fractionated coconut oil and essential oils. However, the roller balls do not move! I have tried everything and they only roll if you roll them on your finger.</li>
    <li> I love my purchase!  It got here quickly and they work perfectly.</li>
    <li> Every ball has fallen out of the roller. What&#x27;s the point if they don&#x27;t work?!</li>
    <li> Roller bottles work perfectly for my homemade oil concoctions! Great product</li>
    <li> Great Product, I already made a bottle w/ lavender oil and FCO to have on hand.</li>
    <li> I cannot use these, they are weirdly stained, clody and have a terrible chemical smell. They arrived nicely packaged but such a waste because I cannot use these at all. I would like a full refund of my money, These are made in ChIna and not good quality at all.</li>
    <li> Very Disappointed! Certainly not &amp;#34;High Quality&amp;#34; as advertised. Bottles had dusty film on the inside and must be washed before use, and the rollerballs do not roll well at all. Purchased these to use with my essential oil blends. Will need to go back to original (but more expensive) vendor.</li>
    <li> Terrible!!! 2 bottles were broken when I got them. The bottles aren&#x27;t even really clear. Poor quality, and worst of all, none of the roller tops work right.  The ball falls out.</li>
    <li> I believe these are recycled bottles. The mold for these were a little, could see by the bottom of the container that the mold was sideways. Some were dirty so I just washed with soapy water and scrubbed with the end of a long q tip. One had a chip at the bottom. For the price it isn&#x27;t bad. I&#x27;m using them for samples of essential oils to hand out so for the price it&#x27;s pretty good. I got 24 for $10</li>
    <li> These are the worst bottles I have gotten on amazon. My stickers won&#x27;t stick to the outside of the bottle. The insides are cloudy and suspect on if they have been used before.  DON&#x27;T get these poor quality bottles.</li>
    <li> awful.  Many were cracked, they obviously had been used and the roller part broke immediately.  DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> Use a lot, especially to give samples of oils to friends</li>
    <li> The rollers don&#x27;t work very well not real happy with th</li>
    <li> Some of the bottles were broken</li>
    <li> These bottles were horrible. One was broken, and the rest had a weird sticky hazy spray on them. No matter what I did, they would not come clean.</li>
    <li> so far so good.  no leaks, hold the essential oils with carrier oil for ease of use.</li>
    <li> The last time I ordered roller balls half of them did not work correctly, ALL of these worked great spend the extra money and get these ones!</li>
    <li> Enjoying the roller ball but seems to spluge oil out sometimes when using.</li>
    <li> These are great for essential Oil blends. NO leaks no problems shipped fast. Great deal. Would buy them again.</li>
    <li> Best roller bottles that I have found!! Lids fit perfectly and doesn&#x27;t leak!!</li>
    <li> Everything was wrapped individually and very sanitary. Thank you for coming on time and I will be using these for essential oil blends</li>
    <li> These were ok...a few were chipped and one was completely cracked.</li>
    <li> I received 16 cases of these perfume bottles on 10/1/14.  The quality was very poor and close to 5% of the total order had breakage or damage.  The bottles were dusty and not clear much less looked NEW or of any &amp;#34;High Quality&amp;#34;.  I would not buy another thing from this supplier Vivaplex and I am perplexed as to why Amazon would represent or sell this poor quality of merchandise.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.</li>
    <li> The roller bottle caps didn&#x27;t fit tight and was concerned they would come out.  Had trouble getting a hold of seller to remedy the problem.</li>
    <li> 2 bottles were completly shattered when I recieved them.  The plastic roller balls don&#x27;t even fit inside of the glass bottles &amp; it will cause your essential oils to leak.  Don&#x27;t buy from this company.</li>
    <li> These glass bottles are a life saver. Just mix your choice of essential oils and combine with a carrier oil. It rolls right on. Very pleased with packaging and delivery. Right on time. Will definitely be back for more!</li>
    <li> At first glance, these rollers were exactly what I needed. I&#x27;ve seen some other rollers shipped from amazon and I was really impressed with the way these rollers were packaged. I boiled two of the rollers earlier tonight to sterilize them so that I could use them for EOs for my little ones. I realized shortly after that the rollers wouldn&#x27;t roll. The ball was stuck inside of its shell and wouldn&#x27;t budge. I thought that maybe it was because I&#x27;d boiled them and that it was my mistake. I grabbed another and tried to make the ball roll. Nothing. Not a single one of them worked at all. It&#x27;ll store your EO blends, but good luck actually getting the bottle to distribute whatever is inside! DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> Have tried 8 of the roller balls. Balls do not roll. Unusable.</li>
    <li> These Are A Great Product.</li>
    <li> They get the job done</li>
    <li> Delivered on time. Items as described and secure.</li>
    <li> Pretty much as shown in picture.....not the greatest glass quality but they definitely work great for what I am using them for and what an awesome price!</li>
    <li> They are okay, don&#x27;t roll the greatest. but work.</li>
    <li> the ball sticks sometimes and dont get a lot of oil that comes out .</li>
    <li> I wish I had read the reviews because the roller balls are terrible. Basically nothing comes out. You have to press VERY hard as you roll to get any oil out. And if you are doing it to yourself or to a child, you can see how this is problematic. Cheap but don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> great quality; love them; and they are working great for my oils</li>
    <li> The rollers do not work well.  They barely move and drag very badly.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am super bumed...these bottles pretty much don&#x27;t work.....I WILL NOT BE BUYING AGAIN!!!!! I hate I wasted my money on these. DON&#x27;T BUY THEM!!!!! Find Glass Bottle Outlet on Amazon &amp; buy those!!!!</li>
    <li> Some of the rollers are coming out of the caps when using but other than that, good purchase</li>
    <li> the description does not lie, these are truly high quality rollers. i have gotten really good compliments from friends who have also purchased oils and upon comparing with other rollers, the design and feel to these are superior. also, i love the fact that i can comfortably store these in the original packaging.</li>
    <li> Bottles are great for what I needed. One arrived broken though.</li>
    <li> Very well protected in the packaging. Easy to assemble. Shipped quickly and I put them to use right away!</li>
    <li> The rollers don&#x27;t work.  It&#x27;s a waste of money</li>
    <li> Package came just as expected and none of the bottles were broken in transit. Will order again!</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced. Exactly what I was looking for.  Caps don&#x27;t all fit perfect but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem.</li>
