<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Beautiful &amp; larger than I expected.  There were a couple of loose stones - but easily fixed with crazy glue.</li>
    <li> I waited about a week before of use, before I gave this review. I recieved all 32 items claw clips I ordered. They were packaged with extreme care. I examined each clip and was amazed at how gorgeous they were. The photos do them absolutely no justice! I am mixed, with long curly hair, therefore I&#x27;m very particular about hair accessories. Plastic clips don&#x27;t last and don&#x27;t do a great job. I&#x27;ve been using metal hair clips for over 15 years. These clips are high quality, hands down. The pricing is extemely reasonable. I truly have gotten my monies worth and then some. I would recommend this product to anyone, before going to a mall paying the outrageous prices. If I could rate this product any higher, I would!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s beautiful and shipped quickly.  It&#x27;s a little heavy for my hair and slides right out.  My hair is thin and fine.  But if you have thick and full hair it will be perfect and look beautiful in your hair.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the product and will use it for a special occasion.  What you see is what you get!!  As simple as that!</li>
    <li> Very pretty in the hair</li>
    <li> This hair clip arrived earlier than expected. The clip is beautiful, heavy and sturdy which is why I picked it. It is well made. Will buy another one from them.</li>
    <li> It was missing some of the orange stones I like weaaring these in my hair but not when there messed up</li>
    <li> It was package nicely. It is beautiful up close, though I didn&#x27;t expect it would be a little heavy for my hair, I would still recommend it. Price considered, and if one is willing to wait for minimum 2 weeks for delivery, then this is for you.</li>
    <li> This clip is gorgeous, but way bigger than I expected it to be.  The service was excellent, got it quick, in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Very pretty worth the money.</li>
    <li> It took a bit longer to get it but it is finally here.It is a bit bigger then I expected but I like it a lot.I got in 3 colors and am happy I got and the price is amazing.</li>
    <li> These are extremely beautiful, I ordered three. However they are REALLY heavy and quite large, my thin straight hair has a tough time holding it. I&#x27;m getting creative</li>
    <li> Shipping/Customer service - My first hair clip arrived broken, this company responded immediately and replaced the item with free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;The hair clip - Beyond gorgeous, I receive compliments every time I wear it.  Great craftsmanship, lovely product, must have thick hair to hold in place.  The product image does not do it justice, it is beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this company and the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you :)&lt;br /&gt;Trish.</li>
    <li> Lovely!&lt;br /&gt;Took 7 weeks to get here but worth waiting for.&lt;br /&gt;It is stunning!&lt;br /&gt;Would order it again!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a bunch</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t find many pretty hair accessories in the orange color. I love orange and was very pleased with the item.</li>
    <li> I bought this piece and the blue one for my mom.  She loves it and gets compliments on them every time she wears them.  I was surprised at how nice they look (the quality) for such a low price.  I would definitely recommend this item for those who are into wearing hair clips and who have enough hair to wear one.  The seller is professional and speedy to respond in regards to inquiries.  I will definitely be buying more hair clips from this seller.</li>
    <li> my entire life I have loved peacocks and this necklace is so pretty.  I keep it on the hook so I can see it when I want.  Anytime I see peacock jewelry at a reasonable price I buy it.</li>
    <li> This hair clip is gigantic! A lot bigger than it looks in the picture. Now having said that, it&#x27;s perfect for the back of your head. It&#x27;s beautiful and really sparkly and the metal is really shiny and nice. Can&#x27;t beat it especially for the price and fast shipping. Way faster than it said it would be.</li>
    <li> I ordered this barrette because it was so inexpensive. A clip like this retail can be $6-$8, so it was price that was in my final decision to get this on Amazon. It came directly from China so it took a couple of weeks to get here. The clip itself is heavy, maybe too heavy for really thin hair. I use this type of clip after I have already put my hair in an up do and this is just the finishing touch over the top of the do, so it isn&#x27;t holding the hair do in place. My only complaint is some of the crystals are glued on crooked, but in my hair, I don&#x27;t think anyone is going to notice. Overall, it is really pretty and I would order something similar to this again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely gorgeous, albeit heavy. Gave it as a gift to my sister and need to buy me a replacement. It is heavy and requires thick hair. I want to buy it in more colors, but the orange was so pretty. Shipping took a while but was packaged well.</li>
    <li> This is very pretty, the picture does not do it justice. Shipping was earlier than scheduled. This is heavy. Works good with a bun to anchor it!</li>
    <li> Beautiful, and worth every penny, though it took a long time to arrive. Enormous, though. Longer than my hand. High quality, though.</li>
    <li> This hair clip is so colorful and gorgeous in person I never saw anything like them and so happpy to have it</li>
    <li> the item looks very very old.</li>
    <li> These are a strong hair statement. They are bold and hold hair well even though I don&#x27;t have a ton. Great price for a gorgeous hair clip</li>
    <li> Love it.  These hair clips are gorgeous . I really get compliments.  They look so expensive and vintage.  A work of art.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, great price, speedy shipping and works well. Would highly recommend to friends and family!</li>
    <li> Big, bold beautiful is a piece that attract attention strong settings. I will recommend to anybody the price is right</li>
    <li> Its color is very rich, keeps my hair well together, i have thick hair. Good condition. Beautiful piece, i love it</li>
    <li> This hair clip was a pleasant surprise. Much larger than I expected and very heavy and sturdy. The stones are well set and the color is fairly true to the photo (although the clear stones were a little redder then I expected, this did not deter from the piece at all). Because of it&#x27;s weight, fine hair may not be able to hold it. I would definitely recommend this piece!</li>
    <li> Took a liitle longer to get it but worth the wait</li>
    <li> two of the beads fell out before I eveb got it out of the package-had to reglue them in.  Other then that, its a pretty piece.</li>
    <li> I love this hair clip . It is a pretty autumn like color. I have a purple one just like it. I will buy some more of these.</li>
    <li> nice but the nice can be reduce a little in size. Maybe that will help reduce the weight</li>
    <li> Gorgeous, Heavy, High Quality piece for the price! I purchased one for myself in blue and was so impressed that I bought another one in orange for my mother.</li>
    <li> Better than described.  A little bit larger than I expected but in a good way and very light.  My thin hair will definitely be able to support it.  I ordered to check it out but intend to order a bunch more as stocking stuffers for Christmas.  This is one of those buys where you felt like you received more than what you paid.  Gorgeous.</li>
    <li> This hair clip is beautiful. You will absolutely love it. I purchased several colors and always get many copliments when I wear them.</li>
    <li> This hairpin is really solid and sturdy, which is a plus since I have thick hair. It looks just as nice in person as it does in the picture!</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like what you see in the photo, wait till you see it in person !!, yes it is large. What&#x27;s wrong with big? many reviewers&lt;br /&gt;seemed to make that out like that&#x27;s the downside, uh uh.  THE BIGGER THE BETTER, people can see this, AND IT GET&#x27;S&lt;br /&gt;POSITIVE ATTENTION!!! everyone wants to know where you found it. It looks like something handed down , something precious and&lt;br /&gt;rare!!  It stands out in darker shades brunettes, or jet black . VERY PRETTY!.  If you buy a hair clip you want complements and attention on your hairstyle, right?.  If my review has helped you, click the yes below. All reviewers like positive feedback. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend and it looks like I spent a pretty penny! It&#x27;s well-crafted, sparkles, and it&#x27;s just plain elegant! I would give it a higher rating, but the clip itself looks a little flimsy. I&#x27;ve had a similar clip before and I broke in my hair (I don&#x27;t have thick hair). Other than that, it&#x27;s truly lovely.</li>
    <li> Had ordered these in teal, orange &amp; purple. Have received countless comments on them everywhere I go. People can&#x27;t get enough due to beauty &amp; value. (price)</li>
    <li> To heavy to stay in your hair</li>
    <li> These are Beautiful hair clips, they are made strong and hold well, I have long hair and wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else to clip my hair up with...Such Beautiful colors. Every where I go strangers stop and ask me, where did you get that hair clip.</li>
    <li> It is beautiful, not the colors shown, but the colors were okay. I liked that it isn&#x27;t so heavy that it falls out of my hair.</li>
    <li> These pieces came nearly 5 weeks after ordering. I had almost given up on them. Then I received an email from the seller saying that they were a bit backlogged on shipping. However when it arrived, each piece was individually wrapped. They are beautiful! But they are also huge. So I am a bit worried about if it will hold in my hair! Anyway, they are just absolutely beautiful pieces for the price.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re very happy with the hair clips! They are really beautiful and have an amazing quality.... The colors are vibrant and adapt really good to the hair! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> This hair barrette is gorgeous! My recommendation would be to buy it in sets of 2. That way you can put one on each side.</li>
    <li> Love the color...its little heavy than I thought but however its colorful...you&#x27;ll like it..its good to wear and get as a gift...shipping take about 4 to 10 weeks...</li>
    <li> They make great gifts. I have them in every color. The prices are terrific too. I will keep buying them.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter absolutely loves this.  It is very high quality.</li>
    <li> This company provides quality products for a super cheap price.  I almost feel guilty, like I should be paying more!</li>
    <li> Pretty clip but too heavy for regular or medium fine hair.  This clip pulls on your hair with it&#x27;s weight and slowly moves down your pulled back hair.  I imagine it would work well for someone with a thick head of stronger textured hair.</li>
    <li> I gave this peacock to my sister.........(I already bought one for myself in a different color)  she loves Orange.&lt;br /&gt;She pinned it on an orange leather bag.  It looks very elegant.  And let&#x27;s face it...........you can&#x27;t beat the price........</li>
    <li> Very beautiful as pictured.  Wonderful gift idea.</li>
    <li> THE LATCHES ARE NOT VERY STRONG.  THE SMALLER THE HAIRCLIP THE BETTER.  I BOUGHT ABOUT 20 OF THESE FOR THE LADIES AT MY WORK FOR CHRISTMAS AND THE BIGGER ONES DID NOT LAST.</li>
    <li> Nice and looks like it cost more than it did.</li>
    <li> Very Beautiful! About 4 1/2 inches from the tail to the face. Looks exactly like the picture!</li>
    <li> This hair clip is lovely!!! I was amazed at the size and quality for the price. I bought several colors, and still have two more that I want.</li>
    <li> heavy ornament but beautiful</li>
    <li> This is exactly as it looked online. The clip is heavy, because it is all metal. It is absolutely beautiful. I love it.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with this item. Very beautiful. I get compliments every time I wear it and have worn it often with no problems with workmanship.</li>
    <li> Great color orange i like and love it ty</li>
    <li> This hair clip is so beautiful, more so than the pix. I have bought several of these in different colors, and they are all very elegent. It holds quite a bit of hair. I have long, thick hair, and I pull my bangs back with it. Would definitely recommend all the colors of this clip.</li>
