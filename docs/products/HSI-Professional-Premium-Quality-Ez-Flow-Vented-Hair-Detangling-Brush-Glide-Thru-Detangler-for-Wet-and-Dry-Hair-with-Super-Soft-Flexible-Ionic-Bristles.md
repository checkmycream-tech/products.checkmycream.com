      <li>It nicely brushes my hair easily even through my thick hair and unlike other brushes doesn’t work good and leave youre hair all tangle up.</li>
      <li>Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t help much with keeping volume in my hair, but great product overall.</li>
      <li>It works better than any brush ever and since it&#x27;s so big</li>
      <li>and I was even able to attach a small chain through the provided hole and hang inside the cabinet door for easy access.  </li>
      <li>More recently I&#x27;ve tried a few nicer brushes and this is a very nice big one.</li>
      <li>It works great on both wet and dry hair.</li>
      <li>i got this brush for free only paying tax in return to write a review.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a de tangle brush, but it still works well to get through hair without pulling too much.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t catch and tug on hair as so many other brushes do.</li>
      <li>I personally like the vents for making it easier to get a comb in there to clean the hair from the brush.</li>
      <li>The wide spaces work well if you are blow drying your hair while brushing, perfect for someone like me with very thick hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is very longest and alway detangling problem old brush and ouch hair too much.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The bristles are spread out wider then many brushes and very soft and flexible, making it  grab and cling to tangles less.  </li>
      <li>Since I am always looking for an amazing brush for my daughters thick, always tangled, hair, I had to order one to try.</li>
      <li>The brush is not too heavy, but not thin or cheap feeling.</li>
      <li>The wide almost flat brush covers more hair area at once and also helps to straighten the hair a bit.  </li>
      <li>This vented hair brush has helped cut the dry time down making getting ready to leave the house a little more stress free.  </li>
      <li>but this brush works great on my hair and isn&#x27;t nearly as expensive!</li>
      <li>Normally I buy brushes at the dollar store, because at some point, it seemed that all brushes were the same.</li>
      <li>The bend in the brush for me was a little to get used to but; with that bend it really helps when brushing around your head gets really gives a close touch  with out having to push or pull your hair out</li>
      <li>I use it on my granddaughter who is very sensitive to getting her hair brushed.  </li>
      <li>I definitely recommend this EZ Flow Vented Hairbrush from HSI Professional for your home or salon use.</li>

    <li> I love it !  Best brush than all!  My hair is very longest and alway detangling problem old brush and ouch hair too much. I found HSI brush, my gosh!  Less detangling hair and less ouch hair !  I can&#x27;t believe it. I admit it,  I did ordered 3 brushes. ☺</li>
    <li> I had a pleasant buying experience and I am happy with the  product</li>
    <li> Love this brush, it was bigger than I expected works great. I will buy another for my daughter.</li>

    <li> This is probably the biggest brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I use it on my granddaughter who is very sensitive to getting her hair brushed.  Her complaints have minimized since getting this EZ Flow vented Brush.  The bristles are spread out wider then many brushes and very soft and flexible, making it  grab and cling to tangles less.  The wide almost flat brush covers more hair area at once and also helps to straighten the hair a bit.  Leaving her hair nice, smooth and silky looking.  I personally like the vents for making it easier to get a comb in there to clean the hair from the brush. Though its a little bulky she can use this alone without getting her hair tangled into the brush and needing help sorting it out.

    <li> This HSI Professional Vented Detangling Brush feels so good on my scalp when I brush my hair. This brush doesn&#x27;t pull my hair but glides through it which helps with less breakage. The curved shape fits perfectly with the way my head is shaped so it helps it glide even more. The bristles aren&#x27;t too harsh on my scalp either which is a big thing for me because my scalp can be a little sensitive! The handle on this brush is very comfortable and allows for a great slip free grip. I love that this brush gets the tangles out smoothly and doesn&#x27;t hurt me! I have thick curly hair so finding brushes that work with my hair type can be a challenge and usually very expensive but this brush works great on my hair and isn&#x27;t nearly as expensive! I would definitely recommend this HSI Professional Vented Detangling Brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> This brush works well in my thin and easily tangled hair. I purchased two of them.</li>
    <li> I definitely didn&#x27;t expect the brush to be this big! Normally I buy brushes at the dollar store, because at some point, it seemed that all brushes were the same. More recently I&#x27;ve tried a few nicer brushes and this is a very nice big one. The entire thing is curved, so it contours to your head. The bristles are spaced apart, so it makes it easier to brush through wet hair. The wide spaces work well if you are blow drying your hair while brushing, perfect for someone like me with very thick hair. It&#x27;s not a de tangle brush, but it still works well to get through hair without pulling too much. The handle has an almost &amp;#34;car tire&amp;#34; like material that gives you a nice grip. No dropping the brush or flinging it when it gets snagged in your hair.The brush is not too heavy, but not thin or cheap feeling. It has a sturdy quality. I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT TO TRY AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.

    <li> Great with straightening hair while blowdrying. I have very long hair and this has done wonders for that process. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t help much with keeping volume in my hair, but great product overall.</li>

    <li> This is a great brush that is great for detangling hair.  Usually when I come out of the shower my hair is extremely hard to manage.  I have tried many different brushes and a few of them damage my hair when I try to brush my hair when wet.  This one does a great job of separating my hair without breaking it, leaving it smooth and much easier to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part (for me) is how fast I can blow dry my hair using this brush.

No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned. I reserve 4 and 5 star ratings for products I would either recommend to others or buy for myself. This is a great product that I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This brush is perfect! I ordered 2 brushes from amazon to see which one I liked ... this one was 100 times better than the crave brush which barely comes through the very top layer of your hair ... I did return the crave one and kept this one. I&#x27;m going to be ordering more for family members too. I&#x27;ve been having a lot of problems with breakage when I&#x27;m brushing out my wet hair ... this brush eliminates the breakage ... I love it!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great brush. I put away all my other ones. I get a perfect blow out every time I use it.</li>
    <li> Very good brush for curly fine hair. Doesn&#x27;t catch and tug on hair as so many other brushes do. A little larger than expected,  but works well.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this brush, it goes thru hair easily and is soft to the touch.</li>
