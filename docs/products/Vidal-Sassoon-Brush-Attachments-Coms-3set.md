<li> since the brush attachment doesn&#x27;t sand will use AMAZONeem to keep it&#x27;s shape, i&#x27;ll be ordering again in the not too distant future and will order via AMAZON!!!</li>
<li> But like my other review for the Andis combs, I wish there was an option to only buy the combs.</li>
<li> Probably not worth the time and effort on the sellers part to only sell just the brush.  </li>
<li> Got what I expected after reading several other reviews.  </li>
<li> I product was what I expected.</li>
<li> I had to buy this replacement because my other one broke.</li>
<li> The combs are made of very fragile and breakable hard plastic.  </li>
<li> But, with 90% of the teeth broken in my present dryer, I decided to give these a try.  </li>
<li> I was a bit unsure whether or not to order this set of replacement brushes for fear they might not fit.  </li>
<li> I thought this would not fit my Andes blow dryer.  </li>
<li> The items do not fit the dryer</li>
<li> I usually wear out the brush before the dryer</li>
<li> I was so sick of having to buy a new blow dryer every time</li>
<li> However, checking with Amazon, I found it &amp; ordered it &amp; received it  in  very few days!!  </li>
<li> I thought my hair dryer was useless because my attachments were broken and lost.</li>
<li> Disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just what I needed.  Right fit!!</li>
    <li> I am very happy that I was able to buy replacement combs. I was so sick of having to buy a new blow dryer every time the combs teeth started breaking. But like my other review for the Andis combs, I wish there was an option to only buy the combs. I never use the brushes, because they aren&#x27;t that strong. But I will say that the Vidal Sassoon brushes are a bit stronger then the Andis brush.</li>
    <li> Fit my old 1600 dryer, I was happy that they fit, I would like to see the combs offered separately.</li>
    <li> The set matches the originals.</li>
    <li> The replacement brushes arrived in a timely manner and worked well.</li>
    <li> Great product, arrived on time and was exactly as pictured.</li>
    <li> Excellent product--swift delivery---Harley</li>
    <li> exactly what I was looking for...thank you</li>
    <li> I had to buy this replacement because my other one broke. It was in great condition. It works well and I would buy it again if I need to.</li>
    <li> I usually wear out the brush before the dryer</li>
    <li> I bought Vidal Sassoon Hair Dryer/Blower a number of years ago &amp; like it very much.  However, with time some of the attachments break &amp;/or wear out &amp; need replacing.  This happened to me recently &amp; could not find the attachments in any near-by store.  However, checking with Amazon, I found it &amp; ordered it &amp; received it  in  very few days!!  That was great &amp; will order more such products from Amazon!  Lastly, the price was very reasonable &amp; considering fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I product was what I expected. I would use this seller again.</li>
    <li> I thought my hair dryer was useless because my attachments were broken and lost. These new attachments are perfect. Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> the one large tooth comb is the only one I use, so it needed to be replaced, this came quickly</li>
    <li> I thought this would not fit my Andes blow dryer.  But if fits perfectly.</li>
    <li> I was a bit unsure whether or not to order this set of replacement brushes for fear they might not fit.  But, with 90% of the teeth broken in my present dryer, I decided to give these a try.  They fit perfectly!  And, the price less than buying a whole new dryer.</li>
    <li> I only wanted the brush attachment, but had to buy the brush and 2 combs for 3X the price.  Probably not worth the time and effort on the sellers part to only sell just the brush.  Its not the greatest, but works better than any other I have tried.</li>
    <li> The combs fit my Vidal Sassoon hair dryer perfectly!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. Fit the hair drier like the originals</li>
    <li> Fits good like original.</li>
    <li> The attachments fit the dryer perfectly.  The service was great.</li>
    <li> Pricey but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else.</li>
    <li> attachments are for future use, purchased as extras as originals get brittle from blow dryer heat and comb teeth start breaking</li>
    <li> Just what I needed :)</li>
    <li> Attachments were as advertised and arrived here undamaged. I now have my favorite old VS hair dryer back.</li>
    <li> They did not fit well and broke during the first use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s always good to find an original anything. Delivery was right on.</li>
    <li> I hated to throw out my hair dryer that still works great just because the attachments wore out.  These fit perfect!!</li>
    <li> Fit my Vidal Sasson dryer and work great!</li>
    <li> Fit the hard dryer I had and stays on.</li>
    <li> Worked out great, the attachments fit the dryer. Could not determine by description.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the same hand dryer for YEARS but keep going thru these!</li>
    <li> Disappointed. Good product but they break too easilly. Vidal Sassoon needs to use stronger materials.</li>
    <li> since the brush attachment doesn&#x27;t sand will use AMAZONeem to keep it&#x27;s shape, i&#x27;ll be ordering again in the not too distant future and will order via AMAZON!!!</li>
    <li> This 3 pc set of VIDAL SASSON IS GREAT!  I&#x27;m glad that VIDAL SASSOON have replacement combs and brushes for there hair dryers. I will order again.</li>
    <li> Got what I expected after reading several other reviews.  The combs are made of very fragile and breakable hard plastic.  I wish that the combs were a bit sturdier.  I just make sure that my hair is completely detangled before using them.  No problem with the fit.  I do not expect them to last long.</li>
    <li> GREAT! My old brush attachment was getting pretty thin.</li>
    <li> This is a universal attachment set. After I bought them, my VS1650 burned out. I couldn&#x27;t find the VS1875 in stores so I bought an Andis 1875 and they fit.</li>
    <li> Fit my blow dryer perfectly</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!  I was a little concerned that the combs wouldn&#x27;t fit my blow dryer since the description didn&#x27;t list my exact model but they fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> Only needed the brush but had to buy the combs to get it.  Would like to see them packaged separately.</li>
    <li> The items do not fit the dryer</li>
