      <li>This definitely works - if you are consistent in using it.</li>
      <li>This is the first time that i saw it packaged in a larger size.  </li>
      <li>I first bought this product from my dermatolgist office (sold in a much smaller container).  </li>

<li> My dermatologist charged me half the price of this tube for 1/4 the product.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is doing the job or not.</li>
<li> I always used to get the small jar for approx $60, so this 8 oz tube was a deal.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m really disappointed and will return to my doctor for another small jar.</li>
<li> So, given the price, here I am cutting the plastic apart to get at the &amp;#34;remains&amp;#34; of this packaging.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this for years and I love it</li>
    <li> I love this product!!  The product was received within days of my order.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended it and although I never spend this kind of money on personal beauty, I do feel it makes a difference.</li>
    <li> Fast service and excellent price</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years now and swear by it.  This is the first time that i saw it packaged in a larger size.  I always used to get the small jar for approx $60, so this 8 oz tube was a deal.  But, the results aren&#x27;t the same!  And i can&#x27;t figure it out.  I&#x27;m really disappointed and will return to my doctor for another small jar.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> It seems like a good product. But I am going to report back after a few more months for a full review.</li>
    <li> excellent buy  excellent product  have used nectifirm for several years</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is doing the job or not. Been using it for 2 1/2 months. Neck looks the same but I will say that I use it on lower eyelids and it does a great job there.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream--it seems to tighten neck skin and smooth&#x27;s out lines on chest.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed a difference and I&#x27;m on my 3rd tube of this size.  It&#x27;s supposed to be good for crepey neck.  I keep hoping.</li>
    <li> I first bought this product from my dermatolgist office (sold in a much smaller container).  I&#x27;m grateful to have found it in a large tube.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this! I use it on all skin that needs some rejuvenation.</li>
    <li> Excellent product- larger size is the best deal and allows me to use on both my chest and neck. Highly recommend !</li>
    <li> winkles are gone...super product...lasts a long time</li>
    <li> This is a really good neck cream.  Being in mid 50&#x27;s neck creases were becoming very noticeable - I noticed a big difference after using Nectifirm.  Obviously, nothing will remove the lines completely unless you decide on surgery, but I do wish I had found this product earlier, it is a now a regular buy</li>
    <li> I was told by a plastic surgeon that this product would work on my wrinkled arms, after months of using it I see no improvement</li>
    <li> Product as described.  Arrived on time</li>
    <li> This is the best value of an amazing product I have seen in quite some time!</li>
    <li> Awesome product recommended by my cosmetic dermatologist. REALLY helps my 66 year old neck to look firmer, tighter and smoother. I can now nactually stand to look at my profile in the mirror!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product before and would like to revise my review.  Nectifirm definitely improves the skin on your neck after religious use.  I think it is a quality product and I have seen positive results. I wil order it again and continue using it.  I think it is well worth the monty.</li>
    <li> So, given the price, here I am cutting the plastic apart to get at the &amp;#34;remains&amp;#34; of this packaging. If you have money to burn, or run a spa, this is probably okay. For those of us involved in spending any excess income on our skin, I wouldn&#x27;t do this size again although I am a fan of the product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 years.  It&#x27;s helped firm my neck and has kept the skin from sagging further.  Great product.  Buying this size is a lot cheaper in the long run than buying it in the smaller containers.</li>
    <li> it is so great I just ordered one more even though I have one now  thank you</li>
    <li> Great product.  My dermatologist charged me half the price of this tube for 1/4 the product.  Makes my neck look great.</li>
    <li> This definitely works - if you are consistent in using it.</li>
    <li> Worth the money.  Definitely lived up to its claim of reducing the look of wrinkles on neck.  Only have to apply a minimum amount of product in the morning and evening so it should last for quite some time.  I like the texture of the cream and it is easily absorbed without greasiness.</li>
    <li> This products lives up to the hype and the promises.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to order.</li>
