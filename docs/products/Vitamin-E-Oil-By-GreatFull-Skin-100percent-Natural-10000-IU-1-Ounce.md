<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this oil because I heard its good for eczema. Put it in a home made body lotion but I&#x27;m not sure how much it will help yet. It came in on time and was as advertised.</li>
    <li> Due to my husband’s eczema we have to be careful what we use. However, this oil makes his skin soft and the oil absorbs into his skin making the skin less dry looking and the eczema less noticeable. It didn’t irritate his skin. Thankfully, there is no fragrance otherwise there would be no way my husband would let me use it on him. I love this oil because when the weather starts to turn dry; my hands feel dry but only after a few days of consistent use my hands are silky soft. And I love the fact that this has 100% natural ingredients, as close to organic as you can get, and its made in the U.S.A. Note: A little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus the shipping was super fast too.</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with my DIY deodorant that I make in batches. Love the fact that it adds a great dimension to my deodorants and for the price, it was just perfect.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time,&lt;br /&gt;Good product .Goes on smooth , left my skin soft and moisturized, will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Very hydrating I had a small rash on my arm put a few dabs and it cleared right up...really helps with dry skin..</li>
    <li> Love this Vitamin E oil!  I just put some on my crazy looking eyebrows &amp; they are tamed! I will be using this on my lips, hands &amp; face before gloves going on &amp; shoveling snow or taking out the garbage! It even tames your wild static-filled hair.  Even the scar on my hand looks better &amp; moisturized.  What a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a natural form of vitamin E for a while. This product has very good ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I started using it around eyes and my lashes are much fuller and longer now :)))&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive  oily skin. I use it  on my lips and whole face now. Just a little amount is enough. I use it over vitamin c serum..&lt;br /&gt;It obsorbes very well. I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I use it every night on my face.  I could tell an improvement on my skin almost immediately.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m now 8 weeks post op tummy tuck. My scar is hip to hip. I&#x27;ve been applying this Vitamin E oil &amp; cocoa butter 5-6x daily and the scar is greatly reduced. My plastic surgeon was blown away how quickly it&#x27;s healing and faded. Just ordered another bottle. LOVE the results it produces.</li>
    <li> Seems to be helping to fade my stretch marks.</li>
    <li> bought e oil for my acne scars. and to make my homemade lotion</li>
    <li> Good product. Nice size bottle with dropper, Vit E oil is easy to apply andd had no odor. Just what i expected</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product. Made a difference in my skin immediately.</li>
    <li> I love that this oil is not greasy and sticky like others I have tried. It comes with a dropper so you can put just as much as you need easily. It also doesn&#x27;t really have much of a smell, I&#x27;ve had smelly Vitamin E in the past and this one is great! I use it on dry skin spots and stretch marks. I highly recommend this Vitamin E Oil!</li>
    <li> Love this oil! Amazing on its own but love it in my homemade face and body oils! I even got a thankyou card for ordering!</li>
    <li> love it !!!! /my sons  lips get dry really bad and we&#x27;ve used every lip balm you can think of and it only helps for a little bit. But one dab of this everyday and it has helped heal his lips. I wish i would have know about this sooner!!</li>
    <li> love this oil... its not think and sticky feeling i will order again</li>
    <li> My blemishes are lightening. And the stretcharks on my stomach as well. Great product!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for two weeks now. I&#x27;m putting it on a scar I have. I can already see a small difference in it. Excited to see what long term use will do to it.</li>
    <li> I use it on my face and nails. Love it!</li>
    <li> Nice absorbing vitamin E oil! This is not sticky like straight vitamin E oil as it has coconut oil ester in it as a carrier oil  The oil has a mild woodsy scent that easily absorbs into your skin!  A few drops is all you need to make your skin feel silky smooth and this vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant for healthy skin.</li>
    <li> Good for skin, scars an any general skin problems.  Works well</li>
    <li> I used this along with aloe vera gel to apply on my stretch marks to make them fade. Used for 2 weeks straight and then got a little lazy to use every day. Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference...I wonder if there&#x27;s anything more effective for old stretch marks that will definitely work? I also put a few drops into my night cream and it seems to help hydrate and I&#x27;m sure will help with premature wrinkles. [I&#x27;m 22..no crazy visible wrinkles yet] so I wouldn&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> great skin moisturizer soaks in well</li>
    <li> I really like the way Vitamin E Oil By GreatFull Skin makes my skin healthier.  I am a 69 year old woman and was beginning to have some skin problems that I have never had before.  The Vit E oil seems to make a great difference in my skin.  I will continue to use this product for a long time.  This is my 2nd bottle to order from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product! I saw results in the lightening of dark spots on my face within a week. It was quite remarkable! I&#x27;ve used expensive creams and didn&#x27;t see the type of results I saw with this wonderful product. It also helps brighten the skin overall.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product , I used it everyday on my face, I think this is the only vitamin E you guys have. I have been looking for your vitamin c with hypnotic acid on it , I believe you don&#x27;t have it. I hope one day you will make them. Please let me know what other skin care guys have. Thanks</li>
    <li> I used this on a spot of chapped skin on my 4 year old son&#x27;s chin.  It healed quickly and his skin was very soft.  It isn&#x27;t oily or greasy.  It also leaves my hair shiny and works wonders on my dry knuckles.</li>
    <li> Really enjoy this product</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  Takes away wrinkles and heals dry skin.  Clears up scars.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a good vitamin E oil to add to the serum I make for my eyes and face, and after reading a lot of reviews and comparing different vitamin E oils from different manufacturers, I got this one and I am so glad that I did. It has been 4 weeks since I started using this in the serum and can notice the difference in my skin. My husband also commented on how better my skin looks now. I also use this oil for my hair along with other oils. Recommend this to anyone looking for a good vitamin E oil for face or hair.</li>
    <li> I am stretching my ears out so I use this on them twice daily and also use this as lubricant for the actual tapering. It works great and I love it. It&#x27;s a very high quality product.</li>
    <li> Got this for my son, who is in gymnastics, this helps heal his hands when need be</li>
    <li> Nice texture, feels soothing on the face especially the under eye area. Absorbs well. I would like more information on exactly where the Vitamin E is from and the way it is processed.</li>
    <li> A-mazing!!! I am very pleased with the product, shipment and time. Yes the product is expensive, but is worth every penny. I rather get a product that will help my health then to buy multiple products that doesn&#x27;t help my skin at all. Advice: Do your research, it is time consuming, but is well worth it....</li>
    <li> I originally got this for my face and ended up trying to use it on a scar on the back of my knee where the dermatologist had to dig something out back in December.  The spot NEVER healed and looked disgusting until I started putting this vitamin E oil on it.  I wish I would&#x27;ve taken a before and after picture of the results because it has truly healed the spot and it looks 100 times better.</li>
    <li> Sorry i cannot comment honestly for an extended time of use, my bottle fell and broke in my Bathroom 3days after i opened it. I do believe the results would have been great if i was able to use it more consistently. I definitely felt a difference after applying the oil, for the 3 days i used it in the morning and at night time it quickly absorbed into my skin and it was not oily.</li>
    <li> Very good! After 3 days using my skin became very soft!</li>
    <li> Smells like vomit! Everytime I use this my son says I smell like vomit</li>
    <li> I love this product . I&#x27;ve been using it throughout my pregnancy and at 8 months have yet to see a stretch mark. Best part about it is that the oil isn&#x27;t sticky, smelly or messy. On my second bottle going on a third. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> It has a slight fishy smell to it but I think that&#x27;s normal.  I have a very sensitive nose so it does bother me but again, I guess the smell makes it legit?  I use it with coconut oil and the smell is masked.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say anything about its benefits so I&#x27;ll update later.  For now, 4 star.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for the first time; on myself &amp; my husbands scalp; for 2 weeks now! Love, Love, Love it. Absorbs into the skin Beautifully! Goes a long way.  Will diffenently order his Amazing Vitamin E Oil, again &amp; again!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> It is a good product. I use it for a week, and feel good. Just a little problem. It is too oily. All overall, it is a good vitamin E</li>
    <li> Arrived early.  Great vit E serum.</li>
    <li> AMAZING. I will continue to purchase this product for myself and for my kids. I initially researched and decided on this product because my son was scratched pretty badly on his face at daycare. Really deep and visible scar on his cheek. I did some research and found that this was the only vitamin E oil that did not contain any synthetic compounds. We&#x27;ve been using it for 4 months daily/2x (with some missed days here and there) with great results. I even slap this stuff on scraped up knees or elbows and literally the next day the scrapes have healed over.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff ! I will definetly be ordering more . I use this on my scars and I am definitely seeing a difference .</li>
    <li> I love it!! It has so many uses!!</li>
    <li> Great product.  I&#x27;m not a fan of chemicals and fake ingredients so it&#x27;s nice to know their are great companies like this out there!</li>
    <li> This Vitamin Oil is authentic.  Some are watered down, but not this one.  Sometimes other products mix in different low cost oils, and this one is pure.  It&#x27;s a nice feel, and nice positive bottle, branding. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Great product.  I bought this for a med. size bump / scar tissue on our new puppies head as well as scabs on her ears from mites.  My vet recomended.  No kidding, the bump and scar tissue are gone and she regrew hair on it.  Scabs gone also.  I started putting this on my face.  Ill check back in on the progress.</li>
    <li> Wonderful Oil. Using it with coconut oil each day for a facial moisturizer. Love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for about a month now. Some previous reviews said that the oil is rich and easy to absorb and most of the reviews are great. But I one I got is kind of watery and is not able to absorb on my face. Am I getting the same quality of oil ????? Or the company has changed the formula????</li>
    <li> Bought this to help minimize scars from major surgery.  So far, so good!</li>
    <li> This product is GREAT!  I use it as a stand alone product and as an additive to homemade beauty products.  I will defiantly purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Used these for my daily regiment skin moisturizer and love the after feeling.</li>
    <li> I am using combination of 5 oil which are frankensin oil,jojoba oil,pomogranate oil,levender oil and vitamin E oil and its not doing miracles but I FEEL GOOD USING THEM COS THEY  ARE ALL NATURAL.I WILL BUY THEM AGAIN</li>
    <li> I recently had minor surgery on the top of my forearm.  The scar is not quite an inch long.  I&#x27;ve been putting this oil on it twice daily and I&#x27;m amazed with how quickly the scar is healing up.  I only wish I would have started using this product the first two weeks after the stiches were removed.  I was using another vitamin E oil, and I started to become concerned with how the scar was looking and healing.  So, I went to my trusty Amazon site.....and took the advice of my trusted Amazon reviewers, and ordered it.  I&#x27;m so happy I did!  I started seeing faster healing within a few days of use.  I will continue to use this product for all of my little boo-boos, but it&#x27;s good to know it works wonderfully on the big ones too. I&#x27;m sure it will help this scar fade in time as well.  I&#x27;m making sure to keep the scar away from any sun exposure!  That is equally important for best results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product everyday since I received it.  My skin is sensitive and had reaction to other essential oil products I tried, but this product is gentle to my skin and helps improve my skin condition.  I also like the bottle that comes with the glass dropper, which makes it easy to use.  Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> The product seems ok so far (for scars). It&#x27;s easy to spread and not too thick or too watery. However, for the price the bottle could have been filled up. That was disappointing. See attached pic.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product.  Excellent for those eye wrinkles. and up a very dry nose. (I live in the SW for part of the year and for those who do they know what I mean).  I used to put Vaseline in my nose for the dryness but my doctor had a fit, very bad for you, she said use vitamin E oil, the pure stuff, as it gets into your system and lungs.  So this way you are also getting your Vitamins!  I use it on my skin too, watch those wrinkles go away and feel the softness, all for a great price.  Great service too.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my diy shampoo, lip balm, moisturizer as preservatives.</li>
    <li> Nice texture. Need it for surgical scar. Excellent customer service. Above and beyond. I was a little uncertain as the smell of the oil was a little off-putting at first, but my skin seems to like it.</li>
    <li> I use this nice vitamin D oil on my psoriasis and it keeps it soft. I not expect it to clear but it give the patches a better, less red look</li>
    <li> Very nice and will work great with my Essential Oil mixtures.  Because it is already mixed with Coconut Oil, I won&#x27;t have to add any.</li>
    <li> It takes a while of consistant use but it works well. Have gotten lots of compliments on my skin!</li>
    <li> Really great product.  Shipping was on time.  Pure 100% Vitamin E oil.  Love how this feels on my face.  Use it as a moisturizer along with some coconut oil.  come with a dropper which is handy.  Wish the price was lower but nevertheless worth the price.</li>
    <li> I got this for making my own lotions mixed with essential oils. It works great!</li>
    <li> Really nice oil for many uses! My scar is healing really well because of this product.</li>
    <li> Works on my stretch marks...</li>
    <li> Bought this after having a pre-cancerous mole removed from my leg. I waited until the stitches had healed the wound and then used this product twice per day for the last 5 days. I can&#x27;t believe it but it really does seem to be making a difference already.</li>
    <li> This has been such a blessing to my skin!  I have been trying to find the key to clearing up my adult acne, and have been doing oil cleansing for a while with some success, but it seems this was the missing key.  I can&#x27;t say enough great things!!</li>
    <li> love it. great product but wish it came in a larger size. pricey but good!</li>
    <li> I really liked the product. It&#x27;s a night product though since it&#x27;s an oil, your face is very shiny. The 5 star rating is a bit abstract. Do I feel my skin is better? Yes. Do I feel/see like wrinkles have diminished? Yes. Has it completely removed wrinkles? Of course not. It&#x27;s a good product and if you are looking for something to try on wrinkles, you should give it a try. I use this as one of 3 products that I out on my face (I use two during the day and this one at night), and I would say I am pretty happy with the results all three deliver.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and needed!</li>
    <li> its okay..fast shipment...don&#x27;t see any difference at all</li>
    <li> I have been using it since 3 months I kept waiting for any improvement in my skin but haven&#x27;t seen any, infact I feel like my skin is getting worse since I started using it. I have been using it religiously 2 times a day. I see more wrinkles under my eyes and facial skin looks worse.  I definitely need my money back. After a month oil started stinking like its getting bad.</li>
    <li> exactly as advertised</li>
    <li> After 2 weeks of use I can say for certain, this is awesome stuff!! I am a somewhat sun-damaged sun and water lover and I was astounded at the results I got on my eye wrinkles on the very first use. The fact that this product has no soybean oil in it is a huge plus and since coconut oil is my go-to for everything from cooking to making my lotions and body butter it is just an added bonus that coconut oil is in this Vitamin E oil as well. I don&#x27;t care to use 100% Vitamin E oil because it&#x27;s just too darned sticky and in my opinion this oil is perfect...and family run businesses are the backbone of our country and I&#x27;m happy about supporting one by using this oil. It may be a little pricier than the ones with soybean oil but it there is definitely a big difference and you get what you pay for and ladies, we&#x27;re worth it!</li>
    <li> Very consistent, healing and sinks in rapidly, so as to not leave an oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived early and worked great.&lt;br /&gt;thanks!</li>
    <li> Great oil to nurish your skin when needed. I use it right after skin treatments &amp; it really helps me heal.</li>
    <li> Wonderful oil for my skin.  It truly helped with my sensitive dry patchy areas on my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having problems with dark spots for years and being a 20yr black woman, my dark spots are very noticeable and causes major insecurity. I have LITERALLY tried everything and was going to go a far as laser surgery to remove the spots. All of this to say that after using this product for only a week (morning and night) I&#x27;ve seen my face become brighter, healthier and my spots lightening. I have hope that in 3 months I&#x27;ll see significant changes. Thanks a lot!</li>
    <li> Great oil for face moisturizer &amp; heals blemishes.</li>
    <li> My wife seems to like it, so far so good. I will write a longer review once my wife uses it for a couple of months.</li>
    <li> The natural vitamin E  oil appears to be working as I expected. It does appear to be helping my skin, even though&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using it for 17 days. It certainly feels better. I hope that I can switch to the synthetic and maintain&lt;br /&gt;the same result, due to the cost.</li>
    <li> Nice oil.  Seems to be helping my scar...</li>
    <li> I am disappointed because this broke my face out.  I am puzzled because my face just doesn&#x27;t break out.</li>
    <li> Will be buying this product again!</li>
    <li> Omg this stuff works wonders.  We can use it for all skin problems and nail fungus treatment as well.  Always remember to stay hydrated and drink plenty of water too.  Hydrating with sports drinks and juice is not the proper way to relieve skin issues.  Water water water!!!</li>
    <li> Had knee surgery and have a large scar. I have heard that Vitamin E can reduce how a scar looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very convenient to use.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I had to have surgery on my stomach and have a pretty nasty scar. I put the vitamin E oil on my scar every night and it is helping my scar to fade! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have many cosmetics/lotions allergies. I apply this under eyes, no reactions/irritation.</li>
    <li> A wonderful light oil which i found can be used for daytime wear since i do not generally use makeup in the DEEP South.  It is however a bit on the expensive side.</li>
    <li> love this oil!  it appears to be high grade. I either apply it directly to my skin or combine it with coconut and essential oils for a healing balm.</li>
    <li> Natural is always the way to go! This works great if you have dry skin! I just add a few drops to my facial moisturizer and the dryness has improved ten-fold!</li>
    <li> Great product. I use this product for softening scars. Works great.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  Probably the best thing I&#x27;ve found yet to improve the texture of my hair, and nice on the neck area too.  I plan to buy again.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! I love that it is a Vitamin E oil that isn&#x27;t soy-based. I use about 5 or 6 drops every day and my skin looks better than it has in years. I was talking to some people at an event recently and when I said that I was going to be 50 this year, they were shocked and said my skin made it seem like I was in my late 30s. (I&#x27;ll take that!) I&#x27;m convinced it is because of this Vitamin E oil.</li>
    <li> this is my third day using it in combination with Vitamin C serum once a day, I bought it to lighten the pigmentation and discoloration resulting from friction and  acne, I am yet to see results, but I don;t like the smell of it, Fishy! its my first time using a Vitamin E product so I don&#x27;t know what to expect, or if the smell is a common thing or not,&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my face and Bikini area as I have, sadly, discoloration resulting from underwear line friction and Pimples resulting from the Hot weather I live in, I am really hopeful it will lighten the skin a bit&lt;br /&gt; I will come back later to update my review</li>
    <li> will update in 30 days of use</li>
    <li> Very light and soaks right into my skin not leaving any oily feeling on my skin...will buy again!</li>
    <li> the smell is a little off but it&#x27;s a good oil, i use it on my dry spots on my face</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I use it on my daughters hair every couple of days to keep it moisturized. I will definitely purchase more.</li>
    <li> I was excited to find this.  My grandmother swears by Vit E oil.  She has a beautiful complexion and has fussed at me for years to use Vit E.  We will see if she finally approves....</li>
    <li> Went on smooth, not greasy, and my hands felt immediately better.</li>
    <li> leaves my skin very soft and hydrated... I can definitely see and feel a difference</li>
    <li> My skin has done well after applying the GreatFul Skin Vitamin E Oil. I have issues with combonation skin where my T zone is often left dry after I wash my face. I applied the vitamin E oil in my T zone the most and lightly applied it elsewhere. Its not to greasy that it would clog my pores and not to light to keep my skin dry in those dry areas.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! I love how it makes my skin feel</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Love it!</li>
    <li> My dry skin fels nourished</li>
    <li> Great for making my own moisturizers and reducing scars.</li>
    <li> Nice consistency and blends in well; I look forward to continued use; vitamin oil is the best for scars and damaged skin!</li>
    <li> Vitamin E is very thick and hard to apply to your face. I like how easy this applies, however, it is a little too watery. I mixed mine with some extra pure Vitamin E oil and it works better for my skin. Saying that I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Despite the horrible smell of this product, my wife loved this product so much. It&#x27;s she mixed it with other face product and in term of moisturizing she noticed an improvment in her skin. I woudn&#x27;t reduce the rating for this product for it&#x27;s smell as it&#x27;s results on the skin are considerably better.</li>
    <li> love it! like having vitamin E in a dropper.....easier to use!</li>
    <li> I live in a very cold area and in the winters my skin is always dry until I found this product. I seriously use it all over. My skin feels amazing!!</li>
    <li> so far so good, have only been using for a week. I use this in my DIY facecream, I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s working yet but makes my skin smooth</li>
    <li> use it for all my cosmetic needs particularly good for making serum with vitamin E, I stopped buying those expensive and useless watery serums. DIY</li>
    <li> This product made my skin flair up and now I have small scabs on my face. I guess I&#x27;m allergic to the MCTs in this oil? So before you go to town using this product, patch test it or a couple of days.</li>
    <li> not sure if it is working but will keep using</li>
    <li> This oil combined with my Vitamin C and I&#x27;m golden. Rub a little in my cuticles and boy, my nails are happy!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this oil. I have been using in on some stretch marks and occasionally my face for a moisturizer. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker yet, but it&#x27;s not sticky, absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.  I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I used this for 1-2 months and did see an improvement. Some light scars faded and I felt like my skin was brighter. I used it once a day. I was very happy with that. I noticed after awhile that I would start to get little zits in some areas though. Now maybe those areas were just prone to zits anyway (or maybe I was using too much), but I stopped using it in those places (between my eyebrows and on one side of my mouth). Now I use it  only under my eyes, where I hope to reduce fine lines and prevent deeper ones from forming, and on a couple of dark spots. One of those areas continues to break out and the other does not (not that I don&#x27;t apply it to those areas.) It goes on very smoothly.  Update: I have now been using this for six months. I used it every other day and on the day in between I use the Greatfull Skin Organic Jojoba Oil. I love how my skin looks brighter under my eyes. I feel so much more confident about my face and don&#x27;t feel like I need to cover up dull skin under my eyes anymore. I have been doing this routine for several months now and the two dark spots that do not look like they have improved, but I will continue to use these products and hope to see a difference sometime. However, for the brightening effect alone, I have been glad I have this product and the Jojoba Oil. I dropped the bottle and spilled over half of it, but since I only use a drop at a time, it is still going to last me a long time. Definitely worth the money for such a pure product.</li>
    <li> Love it! high recommend,</li>
    <li> The information on which products are pure vitamin E oil is confusing. I chose this particular oil because it had the best reviews. I&#x27;ve used vitamin E oil before on sunburn and it relieved the burn instantly and also stopped my skin from feeling tight and itchy. I&#x27;ve started using this oil on my chapped hands and it is so far doing a good job of softening them.</li>
    <li> GreatFull Skin Vitamin E Oil works wonders on my skin. I used it after foot surgery and it works really great I noticed a change in about a couple of weeks, which you need to use this product for at least month or more. Everyday use is necessary a couple times a day. Everyday use is great as well. If you have very dry skin this will work great as well. I fully recommend this product it is 100% natural many say they products are and they are not fully 100% natural as they proclaim. If you want full restoration back to your problem skinned areas give this a try it will be worth every penny....</li>
    <li> A bit sticky, but generally great product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s getting the right product at the right price.  It&#x27;s cost is enough that you know it is real and comparable to what is out there and still just slightly cheaper.  You get what you pay for at a good price.  The consistency/viscosity of the product is good.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, Vitamin E is so good for your skin, hair, nails, etc. Great antioxidant. Good to use before sun exposure to protect your skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Just a few drops go a long way. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Item arrived as describe with fast delivery. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff for using on scars and stretch marks. Feels great on the skin, absorbs well.</li>
    <li> Love it.  So far so good!!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for Vitamin E oil for your skin look no further! This is an excellent product at a great price. I totally love it and you will too!</li>
    <li> I love it. I am adding to a sugar scrub I make. Vitamin E oil works as an excellent moisturizer. Wash your face with a cleanser and warm water and make sure it’s dry before applying some vitamin E oil with a small piece of cotton. Wear it overnight and wash your face again in the morning. Not only will your skin feel more moisturized, but due to the antioxidants in the oil, your skin will glow. No more than twice a week since it’s not recommended to be used as a daily moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00NH70RBU Vitamin E Oil By GreatFull Skin, 100% Natural - Best Way to Treat Skin - 10000 IU, 1 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> This oil is very light and packed with vitamin e. The ingredients list only includes 2 things, with one being vitamin e and the other being for texture to carry the vitamin e. It doesn&#x27;t go on greasy even though it&#x27;s name says it&#x27;s an oil. I&#x27;ve been using it on acne scars and dry patches of skin and the acne scars are fading. Dry patches are also gone. I&#x27;m using it on stretch marks also and expect to see continued improvement in their reduction. No fragrance or anything to irritate skin. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I have cracked finger tips from washing my hands too much.  This will do job!</li>
    <li> Recipient iced item in great time! Thank you</li>
    <li> Wonderful goes on like silk and disappears on my skin. Great under makeup. I like it best at night...</li>
    <li> This is great for dry spots especially on your skin. I love using it on the few dry patches I have before putting on my daily moisturiser and it works superb! Within a couple of uses, it really makes a difference on your skin. The best part is that just a couple of drops are all you need so this bottle will last a while!! I totally recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> Works great . Leaves my skin really soft</li>
    <li> love this works so good</li>
    <li> When I was in college I took a biology course that discussed how nature interacts with our bodies. Basically it was about how herbs and oils work, and why people use them. Our teacher spent quite some time refuting herbal claims, but he did discuss things that worked. One of the things he touted was Vitamin E. So when I had the chance to try this product (to be able to leave an honest review) I jumped on it.  This is a great moisturizer which I enjoy using before lotion on really dry skin like my elbows and knees. I don&#x27;t need much and it keeps them from cracking later! Great for anyone looking to keep thirsty skin quenched.</li>
    <li> Gets no purer than this!  Feels great</li>
    <li> What an amazing wonderful product! I love this it works wonders and going to bite from my girlfriends and put it in their Birthday presents</li>
    <li> Great product!  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this Vitamin E oil! The consistency is perfect, not sticky, and it glides over your skin. I use it on my face &amp; neck &amp; it is really helping to reduce fine lines &amp; acne scarring. Doesnt leave an oily residue if you dont apply too much &amp; it leaves my skin feeling silky smooth. Im definitely a lifelong customer now, highly recommend it &amp; customer service is excellent!</li>
    <li> Thank you for an amazing deal!</li>
    <li> I had no experience with Vitamin E Oil before getting this one and I love it! It is great for multi use but it makes my skin feel amazing! Excellent product!</li>
    <li> This product has work on my skin by softening and taking away the dark spots that was once there. I used this product for about two weeks and i was intrigued with the results.</li>
    <li> This Vitamin E oil is superb. I&#x27;m using it daily and my skin is better for it. It&#x27;s a quality product.</li>
    <li> Love, love! I use this under my eyes and it looks so much smoother and very soft.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite product so far. I use it in all my home made body butter recipes.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I was having an acne break out and used this at night and even during the day before I put on my makeup. Cleared right up!</li>
    <li> Product feels wonderful on your skin.  A little goes a very long way.</li>
    <li> Love this vitamin E oil!! I have used it on my &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin as well as my son&#x27;s dry/sensitive skin....it has worked great for both! The dropper bottle makes it very convenient to dispense the perfect amount. It absorbs very quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. It shipped quick and customer service is great!! I have tried 2 of Greatfull Skin&#x27;s products so far (emulator oil and this) and have loved both products for my kids and I!! Will continue to use this company!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month and I honestly haven&#x27;t seen any positive or negative effects. I really don&#x27;t know if its even working or not. I&#x27;m really hoping that it does because I have like a million red acne scars on my face that I want to fade away ASAP. I know that it takes time, but I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement on any of my acne scars since applying this product. I apply it all over my face and neck at nights and during the days that I don&#x27;t go to work, I apply it twice a day for that extra effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil takes a minute or so to penetrate the skin. When I first put it on, it makes my face look super shiny but after 30 minutes or so, the shine is barely visible as it soaks deep into the skin. I&#x27;ve been applying it under my eyes to help diminish fine lines and wrinkles. I&#x27;m not even 30 but I have some fine lines under my eyes. So far, no improvement of any kind. Not sure if there is any improvement that can be expected, but I heard so me reviews claiming that this oil will make fine lines less visible and get rid of scars quickly. So my expectations were quite high. I do have acne prone skin and this has NOT broke me out, which is a big positive thing to say. So at least its not doing any real harm. I&#x27;ll continue to try it for a number of months to see if it has any real effect.</li>
    <li> after first use saw results. my skin was glowing. felt great. amazing product.</li>
    <li> Product (vitamin E oil) arrived fast and I was excited to use it. I would not believe this if it didn&#x27;t happen to me, but the very first day of using this my skin had a glow to it. It looked so good that I actually commented on it to my husband, and I don&#x27;t brag about myself like that. I have heard so much about how great certain oils are on your face, so if I was going to try them, I wanted to start with one I have heard of before as being great for skin. I love it, so I will definitely try the other oils as well. I later ordered the marine toner from this company as well, since I was so happy with the vitamin E oil. I haven&#x27;t been using this long, but I have to say any product that shows results on day one, has me sold. I want to add this last part just because I read so many reviews that mention this....I did not receive this for free for a review. I don&#x27;t even have any clue how to be lucky enough to be asked to do that. I am a real customer who had good results and took the time to say something since I rely on reviews so much myself. Give it a try! Greatfull Skin is a great company who seems to really care about customer satisfaction. And you can&#x27;t get great customer satisfaction by niceness alone.......you have to also have great products.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I use it on my face mostly, sometimes on my hands and neck too...it leaves my skin soft and younger feeling, and looking too I hope!</li>
    <li> This Vitamin E oil is a miracle oil !! I have had a scar on my face for years and this oil has cleared it to the point where it is almost invisible! I use it morning and night with my moisturizers and it has given me a glow that I cannot believe! Thank you Greatful skin! You have a customer for life!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and packaging.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for the great product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first time buying Vit E in general but I will definitely order again (even if it&#x27;s a bit expensive, did a huge search for Vit E here and this one&#x27;s the best, actually). I also really like the Customer service (several emails for follow ups, etc) since it&#x27;s a really important thing for me :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this brand.</li>
    <li> So much better than synthetic!</li>
    <li> This is pure vitamin E oil but diluted with a carrier oil (coconut).  If&#x27;s an odorless oil that I&#x27;ve been using on a burn, and it glides on beautifully. This product comes in an amber jar with a stopper, and it&#x27;s surprising how that&#x27;s a thing but I appreciate it because I don&#x27;t want to waste the oil while applying it.    Would I buy this again? Yes. Yes, I would.    The seller (GreatFull Skin) is very serious in their customer reviews, as they will email you and make sure all is well in your decision to purchase. They&#x27;ll be happy to know that I am happy.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> This Vitamin E is the real thing, not synthetic.  Pricey, but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love this! By itself, it is so smooth on the skin. I also used this to make a serum to help with breakouts for my teenager. The results have been amazing. Thank you so much for this awesome product!</li>
    <li> This a light weight (thanks to the carrier oil) vitamin E oil that soaks in immediately so that you can apply anything else you&#x27;d like over it.  Well, I give it a few minutes as I do with each skincare item in my routine, however it does sink in quite nicely.&lt;br /&gt;I actually made a mistake with my purchase and thought this was a PURE vitamin E oil (D-Alpha tocopherol which is the type of Vitamin E I wanted-natural).  I was bummed and almost sent it back, however I was almost out of the &#x27;other&#x27; bottle i had by another brand (which wasn&#x27;t  D-Alpha) so kept this and started using it.  I like it and yes, I&#x27;d do it again.</li>
    <li> I did get a coupon for this but it has been wonderful ... I use it on me the animals and in skin mixes</li>
    <li> great product and arrived quick</li>
    <li> This Vitamin E oil is superb! It doesn&#x27;t have any nasty aromatherapy oil like the last one I bought. I love that the carrier oil is coconut oil because it makes it glide on your skin silky and smooth, not sticky at all! It is all natural with no additives and no overwhelming perfume smell. This is truly superior Vitamin E oil and I definitely will be purchasing it again! This is one of the best ones on the market I have used so far. I would recommend to anyone, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> pure oil is good for my skin</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time today and was so surprised!  I have to use a very harsh face cleanser to keep my acne at bay. Because of this, my face usually feels tight, dry and uncomfortable.  I applied this oil and it soaked in quickly and feels fantastic! I tried a different oil before this one and this one is better by far! The other is going into the trash.</li>
    <li> I use this to help lighten scars Bottle lasts long time</li>
    <li> This is great for keeping young, healthy skin!!</li>
    <li> I use vitamin e oil on my face, skin, scalp and hair. This is perfect to mix in your favorite lotion or cream - or make your own beauty mix! Vitamin E oil has so many uses. I mix this with other oils and use it on my scalp and hair, it works wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some of the benefits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treat scars or burns, use on stretch marks, treatment of eczema and psoriasis, use on dry nails and cuticles, treatment of chapped lips and cold sores, use as a skin moisturizer, has anti-aging benefits, treatment of sunburn, treatment of brown spots, under eye treatment and Make-up Remover, stimulates hair growth, repairs split ends.</li>
    <li> Great vitamin E oil. Use daily on scars, dry areas, face. Would buy again, good quality.</li>
    <li> This product works great.  I had knee replacement surgery and am using it on my scar.  It seems to be helping and have only used it a few times at this point.  I also like the fact that it is Vitamin E and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of other things in it as some of the cheaper products that say they are Vitamin E but it turns out there are additional elements that I do not want or need.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast and product was as discribed. Only problem was that the cap of the bottle is cracked. The reason for the 4 stars.</li>
    <li> great product :) very happy</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. I have had really oily skin all my life, and I didn&#x27;t think I could combat that by adding more oil. I was wrong. I wish I&#x27;d discovered this sooner. I do have acne-prone skin, and even though this was making my skin look and feel great, I was still getting pimples. I&#x27;ve added about 10-15 drops of Tea Tree Oil to this and now it is perfect! It&#x27;s really clearing up my skin. It&#x27;s great for fine lines too. It&#x27;s the only moisturizer I use now. I just apply 2-3 drops twice a day, after washing my face. I&#x27;ve tried many products on my face to clear it up, Proactive included, and nothing has worked like this. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> My Vitamin E Oil  I use for my hair and face.  I put a little in my moisturizer and it keeps my face so soft and supple.  I also put some around the edges of my hair per my hairdresser recommendation and it really works.  IT makes my hair thicker and I have litter to no breakages.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I was worried about the smell being too strong but it isn&#x27;t.  Works great too, it really seems to aid in healing.</li>
    <li> I love that the bottle has a dropper for application. Needed a non-synthetic vitamin E and a majority of the products are not natural like this brand.</li>
</ol>
