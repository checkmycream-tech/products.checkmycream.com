      <li>Nice citronella smell that doesn&#x27;t give me</li>
      <li>Yes, it does have a strong citronella smell, but it weakens within minutes and then the smell in the hair is quite pleasant.  </li>
      <li>Very strong.</li>
      <li>Most student housing is not checked for lice,yet is for cockaroachs and bed-bugs.</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t make our hair greasy, which is a struggle for us as many conditioners have that effect on our hair.  </li>

      <li>, I&#x27;ve been spraying this on my daughters hair, coats, backpack, hair accessories, she has been bug free.</li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>Not sure which part worked the best, all I can say is that ALL my kids will start using the shampoo and Lice Shield spray come</li>

      <li>Same pleasant aroma and a decent shampoo to boot.</li>
      <li>Light-weight and worth the money.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for a more natural preventative solution.  </li>
      <li>I think after some time (15+ min) the smell goes away, but it isn&#x27;t worth the tears she has over it.</li>

      <li>My daughter got lice right after Christmas this year.  </li>
      <li>I am a super paranoid mama, and the idea of lice makes My skin absolutely crawl</li>
      <li>I also purchased the shampoo which i like very much.  </li>

      <li>It keeps the lice off my kids even when the are having a real problem at the school</li>

      <li>The extra work is worth not having to smell this product ever again!</li>
      <li>The scent does fade quickly but my 9 year old about had a complete meltdown about me putting this stinky spray in his hair.</li>

      <li>; is not the same as &amp;#34;kills&amp;#34;  You have to read the fine print on the back of the bottle, which states &amp;#34;does not kill lice or or eggs, or treat an infestation.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Between birthday parties, story time at the library and older kids that have been exposed to lice, we have been in the clear.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;d be better of doing an olive oil wrap - which will actually kill the live lice if you leave it on long enough.</li>
      <li>It works so far no headlice and the neighbor started useing it and her girl hasn&#x27;t had it again either.</li>
      <li>Dont hold it too close step back and really mist everything.</li>

      <li>After dropping $300 to have to professionally removed, I am using everything possible to prevent it from coming back.  </li>
      <li>We all prefer this smell over any other similar product out there and it also helps calm some tangles, which is an additional perk to those with long hair.</li>

<li> Great bug repellent-</li>
<li> did not have to wait long for&lt;br /&gt;delivery</li>
<li> Better than expensive Paul Mitchell awapuhi!  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s pretty bad at first.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m kind of disappointed in myself for buying this spray.</li>
<li> I occasionally spray it in her hat if she has to wear one and backpack daily, but I usually forget to respray.  </li>

<li> total waste</li>
<li> I also braided her waist long hair and hosed it down with hair spay.</li>
<li> We spray it ever or every other day</li>
<li> IT SMELLS the same as the spray but get over it, would you rather have LICE in your house or a little smell that will die off in a few minutes.</li>
<li> DOES NOTHING FOR AN ACTIVE LICE</li>
<li> and I wouldnt let my little girl play with her since I didnt want to risk her getting it.</li>
<li> My neighbors little girl had head lice twice</li>
<li> and I don&#x27;t want to use a pesticide on my little ones unless there&#x27;s a problem.  </li>
<li> It also leaves temporary stains that do come out in the wash but make you look a little messy.  </li>
<li> After our fourth treatment in two months, I saw this spray in the store and was desperate enough to buy it, hoping for a miracle.</li>
<li> Nothing is 100% though I still check her EVERYDAY when she gets off the bus.</li>
<li> I DO NOT wash my daughters hair everyday.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m just going to stick with mousse and hair spray and do prevenatitve treatments every few weeks.</li>
<li> headaches.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps away biting flies and gnats- never tried it as a lice repellent, but I&#x27;m sure it would work</li>
<li> But consider how often kids hug each other, how often they wrestle on the playground, and you begin to understand that unless you douse your child in a thick sheen of glop  or put him in a bubble, there&#x27;s really little hope of preventing exposure.</li>
<li> A little sticky - not sure if that&#x27;s the intention</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this stuff. it keeps the bugs away!</li>
    <li> We have been battling lice in our home for months.  Just when we think we have it under control, one of our kids will become re-infested.  The school nurse sent home coupons for this product.  My biggest complaint is that it smells REALLY bad!  It smells like you rubbed a citronella candle on your head.  When my kids go to school with this on their hair, their friends don&#x27;t want to even stand next to them because they smell so bad.  Maybe that is how it works, no one will get close enough to spread lice to you. I don&#x27;t know yet if it really repells lice, because we have not used it on a regular basis, due to the smell.</li>
    <li> This item was recommended to me by my daycare provider. This item works great!</li>
    <li> Bought this after dealing with an infestation on my kindergartner last year. The smell makes her gag. She refuses to let me use it. I think after some time (15+ min) the smell goes away, but it isn&#x27;t worth the tears she has over it. I occasionally spray it in her hat if she has to wear one and backpack daily, but I usually forget to respray.  I have no idea if it works or not, but we so far have not gotten another case of lice.  I think the best way to avoid an infestation is to go thru and do head checks at least weekly (I have a RobiComb to help!).</li>
    <li> A little sticky - not sure if that&#x27;s the intention</li>
    <li> Excellent protection for travelling ,on the go.I would spray on public handles and seats,such as for rest-rooms.Light-weight and worth the money.All-natural oils included.Smells Ok.Yet,too small for washing sheets and towels.I would recommend a larger bottle for multi-used bathrooms,dormatory beds,youth hostels and motel rooms.Most student housing is not checked for lice,yet is for cockaroachs and bed-bugs.Safe to use,and easy to carry in your ruck-sack and back-pack.</li>
    <li> Yes, it does have a strong citronella smell, but it weakens within minutes and then the smell in the hair is quite pleasant.  My daughter&#x27;s preschool keeps having outbreaks and so far so good!</li>
    <li> Works as intended, daughter hadn&#x27;t caught lice  yet</li>
    <li> This product smells very similar to a lot of the natural mosquito repellents. Very strong. You can&#x27;t walk around with this on your head. If you can only use at home, etc... you&#x27;d be better of doing an olive oil wrap - which will actually kill the live lice if you leave it on long enough. This product does not kill. I don&#x27;t see that this product serves a purpose.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells like a bug candle. The scent does fade quickly but my 9 year old about had a complete meltdown about me putting this stinky spray in his hair. Also, the pump is difficult to use. I may have got a defective one, unsure.</li>
    <li> I bought this spray for my kids because lice always seems to be a problem at their school.  The product smells a lot like RID though and I don&#x27;t want to use a pesticide on my little ones unless there&#x27;s a problem.  I was hoping for a more natural preventative solution.  Instead I have been putting my daughter&#x27;s hair in a bun which so far seems to work.</li>
    <li> Use this stuff all the time.  We never run out. It keeps the lice off my kids even when the are having a real problem at the school</li>
    <li> Use this every morning before sending the kids to school! Worth every dime to keep the lice away!</li>
    <li> just bought this stuff...used 2 sprays on my daughter and she started running around acting like she was choking (i assumed for maximum dramatic effect) - however i just sprayed 2 squirts on my hair and it was so strong i had to go outside to breathe fresh air and it gave me the worst headache.  going to return it and try a different repel spray.[[ASIN:B003GTST8W Lice Shield Leave in Spray, 5 oz.]]</li>
    <li> We would get the problem solved but the next time they&#x27;d go to school they&#x27;d catch it again.  When we started using this spray too, they never came back.  Dont be embarrassed to buy, nobody will ever know.</li>
    <li> Pleasant aroma and of course hard to tell if it works unless it doesn&#x27;t.  So far so good.  I work in a school and so spray it on my hair and shirts every morning.  Unfortunately the liquid is milky and it sticks the sprayer.  It also leaves temporary stains that do come out in the wash but make you look a little messy.  I also purchased the shampoo which i like very much.  Same pleasant aroma and a decent shampoo to boot.</li>
    <li> I am a super paranoid mama, and the idea of lice makes My skin absolutely crawl, I&#x27;ve been spraying this on my daughters hair, coats, backpack, hair accessories, she has been bug free.</li>
    <li> It is a good product&lt;br /&gt;just wished it came in larger size&lt;br /&gt;It brings quick relief&lt;br /&gt;And is a great conditioner best used at night&lt;br /&gt;even better over night wash hair in morning&lt;br /&gt;with Lice Shield Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was great did not have to wait long for&lt;br /&gt;delivery and was packaged with care!</li>
    <li> It DOES smell strongly of citronella (which is one of the ingredients, so not so strange). My 4th grader came come with a bad case of head lice and after battling it for 3 weeks (and winning) I bought the Lice Shield to avoid any re-infestation and it worked. We used it WITH the Lice Shield shampoo. I also braided her waist long hair and hosed it down with hair spay. Not sure which part worked the best, all I can say is that ALL my kids will start using the shampoo and Lice Shield spray come school start, I will not be caught off guard ever again. And I wished schools would be WAY more proactive then they were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It DOES dry out fine hair so using some leave in conditioner on week-ends can help.</li>
    <li> No BS, this product WORKS no lice at all from the dirty classroom environment . No lice in 4 years ever since using this. Get it and protect your children from the other dirty kids. Spray it once before they leave for school in morning and even do their bookbags and jackets. No more &amp;#34;cooties&amp;#34; here!</li>
    <li> Smells a little strong at first but then mellows out. Very good product</li>
    <li> Great bug repellent- we use it while hiking on our clothes and dog. Nice citronella smell that doesn&#x27;t give me headaches.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps away biting flies and gnats- never tried it as a lice repellent, but I&#x27;m sure it would work</li>
    <li> SO far knock on wood we have not had any lice in our house. My daughter is in her second year of preK and though lice is not present at her school, she is around a ton of kids. Between birthday parties, story time at the library and older kids that have been exposed to lice, we have been in the clear. The smell is STRONG but it has been doing the job. I DO NOT wash my daughters hair everyday. That is the worst if they are in school. LICE love CLEAN hair! I wash my daughters hair once or twice a week. I also spray lice shield, use the shampoo and conditioner and they now came out with a roll on stick. You roll it behind the ears, neck and bottom of the hair. IT SMELLS the same as the spray but get over it, would you rather have LICE in your house or a little smell that will die off in a few minutes. I like the product!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and have been using it for years.  We all prefer this smell over any other similar product out there and it also helps calm some tangles, which is an additional perk to those with long hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter, age 9, has super thick, naturally curly hair and we have been battling the dreaded four letter word all summer. After our fourth treatment in two months, I saw this spray in the store and was desperate enough to buy it, hoping for a miracle. What I got instead was a horrible stench of citronella that pervaded my house and made it unbearable to be in the same room with my poor daughter. It smelled like I poured citronella oil over her. My 15 year old daughter was so repelled by it that she frog-marched her sister back to the bathroom and shampooed her hair for her twice to get rid of the smell. Whether it works or not will remain a mystery to me, because we can&#x27;t stand the smell enough to try it! I&#x27;m just going to stick with mousse and hair spray and do prevenatitve treatments every few weeks. The extra work is worth not having to smell this product ever again!</li>
    <li> My 7 yr old and I love it.  She and I both have thin tangly hair.  So it keeps the tangles down while preventing lice - win win.  It also doesn&#x27;t make our hair greasy, which is a struggle for us as many conditioners have that effect on our hair.  I think it smells like sandalwood or possibly citrus. Pretty strong, but clean.  It all just depends on your taste in smell.  Tip: It&#x27;s cheaper to buy it online.</li>
    <li> I have a son and a daughter and both of their classrooms have had bouts of lice each year they&#x27;ve been in school.  We learned about the product from a school nurse when my son was in Kindergarten. We use both the shampoo and the spray, although not in the same day.  I do not have a complaint about the smell, although admittedly it is not a feminine.  Perhaps others are using too much spray in a given application.  But, what I&#x27;m most happy about is that neither of my children have ever had lice - I attribute that to Lice Shield. I am knocking on wood as I write this review.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this works or if we&#x27;ve just been lucky but my kids never got lice while we were using it.</li>
    <li> Our school has lice in it every year.  We have gotten lice for 4 years in a row.  Plus one year we got lice in our house 4 times!! YUCK.  I got this spray before the school started to stop the lice from coming into our house.  We spray it ever or every other day and we are the first year lice free!!  I&#x27;m so thankful not to wash the sheets, carpets, and and all the clothes (jackets).  It smells like citrus so it is not to bad.  I will buy it again so save us from the lice that is all over the school.  I just wish others in our school would get it so we can get the lice out of school.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m kind of disappointed in myself for buying this spray. I was really interested in buying tea tree oil, but got swayed by the promises made by the manufacturer and also by some reviews of this product. Having lived through a bout of lice in our household, I can confidently say one thing...THE BEST PREVENTION IS A VERY GOOD STAINLESS STEEL NIT COMB. This spray may repel lice, it may not. But consider how often kids hug each other, how often they wrestle on the playground, and you begin to understand that unless you douse your child in a thick sheen of glop  or put him in a bubble, there&#x27;s really little hope of preventing exposure. Get a comb, use it once a month and any time one of those nasty notes comes home informing parents that someone in your kid&#x27;s class has bugs.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I am a teacher and constantly around it.  I don&#x27;t know if it actually works, but the oils are phone mental for my curly hair!!! Better than expensive Paul Mitchell awapuhi!  There is also a spot stick shuck I love for moisture. I think it&#x27;s supposed to make it difficult for lice to settle in the hair/scalp.</li>
    <li> I have never purchased or used this product, but potential buyers should be aware that this company was charged in an FTC lawsuit forcing them to prove their claims that this product actually works and the ftc claiming that their claims were &#x27;deceptive&#x27;..here is a link to the article that I read..http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2014/05/company-settles-ftc-charges-head-lice-prevention-claims-were. If that link proves not to work, just google the name if this product and look at whatever comes up with the ftc mentioned. Just want people to be informed before buying a product that makes claims such as this one!</li>
    <li> I used this on my girls during a lice outbreak at their school and they got it anyway! Doesn&#x27;t work and smells awful!</li>
    <li> My neighbors little girl had head lice twice and I wouldnt let my little girl play with her since I didnt want to risk her getting it. Then I was told about Lice Shield. Yes it has a Strong Citranella smell at first but it truley does fade very fast to a rather nice smell. I use the shampoo on my daughter daily as well as the spray and when or if her hair is dry and I skip a day of shampoo I still spray her with the spray daily! the spray sits on a shelf by the front door and every day she steps out side her hat inside is sprayed, her hair, neck and back of clothing and then I have her put on her coat and backpack and hat and do a final misting. Dont hold it too close step back and really mist everything. It works so far no headlice and the neighbor started useing it and her girl hasn&#x27;t had it again either. Nothing is 100% though I still check her EVERYDAY when she gets off the bus. YES EVERYDAY! I also alternate the shampoo every two weeks with another repel product called Fairy Tails found here and at Ulta Beauty just because I was told to by a stylist once that its better to change it up for the Hair.</li>
    <li> I bought Lice Shield after finding out one of my child&#x27;s class mates has lice. I will agree this stuff doesn&#x27;t have a pleasant smell. It&#x27;s pretty bad at first. but fades with time. I use the shampoo on my kids at night when I bath them, then this in the morning to detangle hair in morning. I don&#x27;t care how it smells if it keeps my kids lice free and so far it has.</li>
    <li> My children have not had lice since I started using this product.</li>
    <li> My daughter got lice right after Christmas this year.  After dropping $300 to have to professionally removed, I am using everything possible to prevent it from coming back.  Added this to her nightly routine.  While it doesn&#x27;t smell the best, I am hoping the lice think the same thing.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t help. doesn&#x27;t smell good. total waste</li>
    <li> DOES NOTHING FOR AN ACTIVE LICE INFESTATION!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Repels&amp;#34; is not the same as &amp;#34;kills&amp;#34;  You have to read the fine print on the back of the bottle, which states &amp;#34;does not kill lice or or eggs, or treat an infestation.&amp;#34;</li>
