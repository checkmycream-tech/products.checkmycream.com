    <li> Best hair gel ever. My husband won&#x27;t use anything else now that I&#x27;ve gotten him hooked.</li>
    <li> Great hair product for a great price. Double the amount at my hair salon !!</li>
    <li> I have been using Biolage Gelee for many years! I got the new blue agave and LOVE it. Just as good and I feel is the same as old product. Smells the same. Styles the same. I even went looking for a product replacement after reading the bad reviews.  But after trying several expensive products and being disappointed, I decided to give in and try the blue agave. It is the SAME thing. So happy!!!</li>
    <li> Not as firm of a hold as I was hoping for my fine have. Takes very little so will last me a very long time.</li>
    <li> I used to use the old formula but this one works just as well if not better.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit sticky and leaves a residue in your hair. When you brush your hair the residue sticks and if you aren&#x27;t careful it will pull out your hair. It does style well - bit plan on washing it out after you make your statement in the world.</li>
    <li> The best hair gel !  Nothing works for me like this one.</li>
    <li> Arrived when it was expected and was as expected. It is a different bottle than the picture, but the product is the same.</li>
    <li> The gelee in the picture is not the gel I received.  The picture shows the old packaging and the old formula which I really liked.  What I received is the new blue packaging and the new formula which do not work for me.  Update the picture Amazon!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love, this product! It is not too stiff but just the right gel consistency for my coarse hair. I have been searching for a long time to find this quality product.</li>
    <li> I forgot to get this from my hairdresser, so looked on Amazon, found a bigger size for about the same price than I pay at the salon (I think it was $17.99 on Amazon in December), and it arrived it two days.  Great product--the only thing I&#x27;ve found to manage my curly hair that becomes a frizz ball without it.</li>
    <li> This gel is what my stylist used.  Loved it!  I live in a rural area and her salon doesn&#x27;t carry product.  Thank You Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a great products, I have been use it for almost 13 years, I don&#x27;t damage my hair still so I&#x27;m very glad with this..</li>
    <li> Have used this gelee for years. Love that you use very little product and get great curls. One bottle lasts me for months.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this and is a regular</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Allows my hair to stay in style all day. You don&#x27;t need much to do this.</li>
    <li> Great for curly hair.</li>
