      <li>It moisturizes nicely and smells great.</li>
      <li>When I was introduced to Pacifica&#x27;s Persian Rose, I wasn&#x27;t fond so fond of it.</li>
      <li>It smells like a rose garden.</li>
      <li>so Persian Rose is my favorite scent from Pacifica.</li>
      <li>I love the rose scent.  </li>
      <li>I love the Pacifica Persian Rose candles as well.</li>
      <li>The smell is very nice, very much like smelling a rose flower.  </li>
      <li>The cream has a strong rose scent that lingers all day.  </li>
      <li>but if you keep your eye out, there are many promotions and sales for this brand.</li>
      <li>Of course, I turned to Amazon and while I had to pay more than I would at Wegmans</li>
      <li>The absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I used to buy this product at Wegmans but for some reason, the Pacifica Persian Rose was no longer available.  </li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>I have almost all the scents and my favorite is the indian coconut.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a fan of all Pacifica lotions but this scent happens to be my favorite.</li>
      <li>I receive many compliments.  </li>
      <li>The rose scent is really strong but it is really pleasant, though most of my compliments on the smell were from women over a certain age...</li>
      <li>Luscious, rich - both the rose scent and moisturizing qualities.</li>
      <li>top note smells strongly of citronella.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really worth it to make sure your skin is moisturized and healthy.</li>
      <li>This stuff smells great and last all day.  </li>
      <li>But having experienced the way the notes open up to my body temperature in different seasons of the year, Persian Rose is now one of my three favorite lotions floral lotions from Pacifica.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It really does smell like a fresh rose</li>
      <li>The lotion is great, very moisturizing and absorbs completely.  </li>
      <li>Thick creamy moisturizer, smells incredible, paraben free, what else could you ask for!</li>
      <li>It smells fresh, like you&#x27;re smelling REAL freshly cut roses; none of that old, musky rose scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it is well worth it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d trust her opinion, she is pretty picky.</li>
      <li>a sweet dry rose, mixed with mango.  </li>
      <li>My GF likes roses and really loves this lotion.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>It moisturizes and is very fragrant.  </li>
      <li>Its also very stong, and the result is as if you were wearing a fragrance.</li>
      <li>The base note that lingers throughout the day is a dry, sophisticated rose, of rose that haa been sitting in full sunlight for a bit.</li>
      <li>Very high quality ingredients leaves my skin soft, and no parabens!</li>
      <li>I really like it and it makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
      <li>you intend not to wear perfumes throughout the day and prefer your scent to bloom little by little discreetly, wafting fragrance as your body heats up during the day, this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $18, pretty good deal--and this is a high quality vegan that always delivers consistent quality and texture--unlike some vegan products that are gummy or crusty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a sucker for rose</li>
      <li>Half an hour later, on a packed subway, I smell like rose</li>
      <li>I never have any dry skin when I usually do no matter how much lotion I put on!</li>
      <li>Most rose lotions and perfumes have this musky undertone that I hate.</li>
      <li>This smells divine and makes my skin soft.</li>
      <li>They say it&#x27;s vegan but is it made from 100% natural ingredients?</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no green here.</li>
      <li>No irritation on my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It does leave a little residue (not bad IMO) and the scent lasts all day.</li>
      <li>Live in the high desert with dry skin and can&#x27;t go a day without moisturizing.</li>

    <li> I picked this up on sale for $8 at TJ Maxx, what a great deal! This stuff is thick and soo moisturizing. I use it after a shower and especially on my hands and feet during the winter. I never have any dry skin when I usually do no matter how much lotion I put on! I&#x27;m a sucker for rose so Persian Rose is my favorite scent from Pacifica. It might be a little pricy but if you keep your eye out, there are many promotions and sales for this brand. It&#x27;s really worth it to make sure your skin is moisturized and healthy.</li>
    <li> wonderful and it feels so good on the skin. I really like it and it makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
    <li> I used to buy this product at Wegmans but for some reason, the Pacifica Persian Rose was no longer available.  Of course, I turned to Amazon and while I had to pay more than I would at Wegmans it is well worth it.  This cream is wonderful.  It moisturizes and is very fragrant.  It truly smells like a real rose.  I receive many compliments.  The item arrived in a timely manner from the vendor, too.</li>
    <li> Thick creamy moisturizer, smells incredible, paraben free, what else could you ask for!</li>
    <li> This product was just as advertised.  I love the rose scent.  An excellent body cream. I would definitely purchase this product again in the future.  I love the Pacifica Persian Rose candles as well.</li>
    <li> Luscious, rich - both the rose scent and moisturizing qualities. Very high quality ingredients leaves my skin soft, and no parabens!</li>

    <li> Love it.  It moisturizes nicely and smells great.</li>
    <li> This smells divine and makes my skin soft.</li>
    <li> Very good lotion. I wonder is it totally organic. They say it&#x27;s vegan but is it made from 100% natural ingredients?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of all Pacifica lotions but this scent happens to be my favorite. It&#x27;s moisturizing and leaves your skin glowing.</li>
    <li> The cream has a strong rose scent that lingers all day.  I like the texture, too.  I would order again.</li>
    <li> The best rose scent in the world! Most rose lotions and perfumes have this musky undertone that I hate. This doesn&#x27;t! It smells fresh, like you&#x27;re smelling REAL freshly cut roses; none of that old, musky rose scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a bouquet of roses at work and for 2 days some coworkers would stop by when they saw the roses. When I put on this lotion, EVERYONE (even guys) stop by to say they smelled the roses down the hall! It really does smell like a fresh rose garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of moisture- it&#x27;s moisturizing without leaving a greasy feeling (use it as hand cream sometimes). It does leave a little residue (not bad IMO) and the scent lasts all day. Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Loved it, perfect transaction, price</li>
    <li> The lotion is great, very moisturizing and absorbs completely.  The smell is very nice, very much like smelling a rose flower.  Its also very stong, and the result is as if you were wearing a fragrance.</li>
    <li> This was a gift.  The absolutely love it. Wonderful smell.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing. I have almost all the scents and my favorite is the indian coconut. If you like roses this is for you.</li>
    <li> No irritation on my sensitive skin. It smells like a rose garden. I bought the perfume to accompany it.</li>
    <li> Very nice consistency and non-greasy. Live in the high desert with dry skin and can&#x27;t go a day without moisturizing. The rose scent is really strong but it is really pleasant, though most of my compliments on the smell were from women over a certain age... tee hee</li>
    <li> My GF likes roses and really loves this lotion. She says it is the best one she has ever used. I&#x27;d trust her opinion, she is pretty picky.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great and last all day.  Not greasy either.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s must have been a really great fragrance, if it had not been rancid. It is moisturizing and feels velvety.  Wish it had not spoiled!</li>
