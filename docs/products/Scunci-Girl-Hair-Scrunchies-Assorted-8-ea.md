### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>These are longlasting and attractive.</li>
      <li>Great colors, look great on ponytails.</li>
      <li>Nice bright colors.</li>
      <li>Great colors that stay, eventually loosen up which is fine - just twist them 3 times.</li>
      <li>I love the bright colors and they are nice in my hair when I go to the gym.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for my 6 year old</li>
      <li>love these.  </li>
      <li>and it looks cute.  </li>
      <li>Very cute, colorful and frilly ponytailers.  </li>
      <li>They are perfect to hold my long, curled hair up off my neck in heat, humidity, wind, etc.</li>
      <li>/&gt;For a toddler, these would work great as a scrunchie, but for big girls or adults you should more accurately think of these as fancy pony tail bands.</li>
      <li>and it still holds her hair pretty nicely.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>She loves them because she can pull back her hair on her own.....</li>
      <li>I wore a set of these out over several years, &amp; am so glad to find them available via Amazon---cannot find them in any store, anywhere.</li>
      <li>She found an old one in my home and asked for more.  </li>
      <li>So pretty.</li>
      <li>Very well made!</li>
      <li>exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>They have a little bit of flair that gives them great quality and style for a better than average</li>
      <li>These are very durable and pretty as well.  </li>
      <li>These are very pretty but they are for a toddler not an adult.  </li>
      <li>I like them so much</li>
      <li>The colors are vivid, &amp; the crinkly-curvy shape is cute &amp; fun compared to a plain colored band, etc.</li>
      <li>These are more for a toddler, rather small.</li>
      <li>Tight fit...</li>
      <li>and now I use them with my 6 year old granddaughter.  </li>
      <li>In case you&#x27;re wondering, these can be used by adult females, no problem.</li>
      <li>They are smaller than the Scunci Hair Scrunchies, but I&#x27;m still able to double mine to hold my hair tight, or if it&#x27;s curled &amp; with large volume, looping it over my hair once to create a ponytail is enough.</li>
      <li>These are cute little hair ties for a child or someone with thin or fine hair.</li>
      <li>They have a better look than the typical scrunchies that have no real design or appeal</li>
      <li>In fact - they are actually large pony tail holders and not really scrunchies at all.  </li>
      <li>and SO wish they were larger, but they are simply too tiny for anyone older than 4 years</li>
      <li>These little Scrunchies are pretty and well made.  </li>
      <li>I got them for my daughter who doesn&#x27;t like having her hair put up due to sensory issues, so I can pull her hair back with these and not have to twist it around and make it tighter to pull on her hair too much</li>

    <li> Used to use these in my daughter&#x27;s hair..and now I use them with my 6 year old granddaughter.  She found an old one in my home and asked for more.  She loves them because she can pull back her hair on her own.....and it looks cute.  She also likes wearing them on her wrist or switching back and forth through the day.  Nice bright colors.</li>
