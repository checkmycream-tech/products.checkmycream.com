<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ordered this on the 18th and received it on the 22nd!!  They came neatly packaged 6 to a box. When I opened them I was very surprised!! Beautiful colors!!!!!! No duplicates... I love love love them all. I would absolutey recommend this product to anyone...</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my niece who is all about the nail polish. The colors are great and she loved it.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m in love with the colors, they came a day early and the colors are better than what i have expected every hing was in tact no broken bottles, my daughter loves them too</li>
    <li> this product is working very well, I&#x27;m happy with it, I&#x27;m just still in the process using it, so I&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> This looked great in the picture and seemed like a good deal for the price BUT they don&#x27;t last even 24 hours!!! The are thin like water and by the time you get enough coats on for proper color you have a gloppy mess. AND the don&#x27;t last - within 24 hours they chip in half and flake off. AVOID water in any way, shap or form. THEN you can&#x27;t hardly get them off with nail polish remover!!!! I have no idea how something comes off so easy when you don&#x27;t want it to but won&#x27;t come off when you need it to. We now only use them for designs</li>
    <li> I loved all the colors i got, but some polishes weren&#x27;t as full as the others. Some by just a little and even some by almost halfway. I got one repeat in color mango #23. Though i seriously wouldn&#x27;t send this back for some minor dysfunction. I think the company could have done a better job in packaging instead of just wrapping them each in blue mesh and just tossing them into a box.</li>
    <li> I would have given it five stars except I got like ten differs shades of purple which happens to be my least favorite color. Other than that I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> So pretty I love this nailpolish I suggest you buy a fast drying top coat or drops wish I would&#x27;ve have gotten more neon colors</li>
    <li> So i got this set today and i was suprised i didnt get the colors i wanted i didnt get the matte top coat i got the nail hardener and i got alot of textured colors and only one green but still great nail polish the remover pads work like a dream i recommend this to any nail polish addict like me lol</li>
    <li> I was happy to receive a lot of metallic and glitter polishes. Good variation of colors, and they work great with stamping plates. Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I received my polishes finally!! I love all the colors I received! I did get a couple repeats but that is okay, it&#x27;s worth the money I got plenty of beautiful colors. Shipped beautifully in boxes and bubble wrap. Couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better shipment. I know people were upset about receiving duplicates but how can you expect them to go through every package! It was worth the money I couldn&#x27;t be happier, all brightly colored nothing damaged. I may order another box just to see what other colors I get I love painting my nails. I love painting my daughters nails. What an awesome collection of bright colors and glitters and neons and glimmers, and so much more. The price was great, shipment was great and fast. I give them two thumbs up for this order and my second one should be soon!!! Order this package you will NOT be sorry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After usage of almost every color the disappoint came from the polishes themselves. They chipped instantly after drying, I have done this process millions of time and never resulted in such quick chipping. Usually my polish job will last 7-10 days but this doesn&#x27;t last 3 hours. It&#x27;s not the fault of the seller, I could have gotten a bad batch of paint, but I\\&quot;m so disappointed by the polishes. I have tried everything, extra coat, better protectant, base coat, less, more nothing changes the dry matte, chipping quality of these polishes. I\\&quot;m so disappointed!! (This does not reflect the seller, just the polishes I received most likely a bad batch)</li>
    <li> I was very pleased and happy with what I got. I got all the colors I wanted. Fantastic product! I will be ordering from you again!</li>
    <li> Received as a gift. This brand just too hit or miss with each bottle of polish...some go on beautiful and last a normal amount of time.....others need a white base coat to show up well, or go on so thick it takes forever to dry...or the worst...some chip off in a matter of HOURS. It&#x27;s not uncommon for my nails to chip fast even with $$ polishes, but dang! Really for the price, even with a lot being..well..crap, It&#x27;s really still a good buy. With normal opi or china glaze you&#x27;d only get 5 or 6 BOTTLES for this price! If you&#x27;re looking for top quality stuff don&#x27;t buy this. BUT if you just want a more vast collection for less than a buck a bottle go for it!</li>
    <li> I got this set as a gift for my 14 year old daughter. She LOVED it. This set brings an extensive variety of colors - hence the 48 colors - different shades of blue, red, grean, yellow and orange. You also have your silver, gold. It has different finishes as well(matte, shiny &amp; glitter). The scented nail polish removers work really well too. Overall, I think it was a great investement.</li>
    <li> This is such a great deal! I just received my package in yesterday and it shipped in about 5 business days! I tried out a color on my nails and it went on there very smoothly. Use 2 coats of holo chrome and then 1 coat of disco ball and it looks beautiful!! Lots of sparkle colors, and neons. Some neutrals, but mainly very girly ones. (But hey, I&#x27;m not complainin!) It doesn&#x27;t smell that bad and it takes the normal amount of time to dry. I am very happy with this purchase and all of my bottles were individually wrapped so they wouldn&#x27;t break which was very nice. I will never have naked nails again, for sure! If your on the edge of buying it, take my advice: BUY IT. You wont regret it. I promise.</li>
    <li> Just received my order of this nail polish set. I absolutely love it, there are so many different colors. Some colors are a bit bright but if you wear the right clothing it will go perfect. Love the fact that there are no repeats of any colors.My favorite as of right now is the \\&quot;Vegas Night\\&quot; . The 3 scented nail polish remover was great as well. I thought it was going to be super small just like a sample, but its not. It works great and love the fact that you only need one sheet for 10 finger or toes. The smell is great, really does smell as what it is. example if you have a melon one it truly smells like Melon. This would be a great gift for all ages, as long as you love nail polish that is. I am a 29 year old and i love nail polish and i thought this is a great price for what it comes with, great packaging as well. Its a must buy..</li>
    <li> The price is great...BUT they take FOREVER to dry! Like over 30 minutes before I can add another coat. Not only that, I never recieved the polish remover. Not happy with the product</li>
    <li> The Polish cracks after it dries.</li>
    <li> I just got my nail polishes in today and they look so awesome!!! The quality of the polish is really great and the bottles are really pretty. The only problem I had is that one of my nail polishes leaked out of the cap. But thankfully, it didn&#x27;t get everywhere. I would surely buy these again with out thinking twice. :)</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughters, great variety in the colors for cheap. Some do stain their nails though. and some just dont work well. I would buy again for this purpose, but not for a woman serious about her nails.</li>
    <li> What a great array of nail polishes! I use these for jewelry making and it&#x27;s a gorgeous assortment of colors. No duplicate colors. Perfect!!</li>
    <li> My mom gave me this nail polish set for Christmas, and I was amazed at the variety of colors and polishes!!!  The colors are beautiful and they are perfect for water marbling (check it out on Google or YouTube!).  They had two of the same colors of polish, but overall I was very pleased! I had a blast trying on each of the colors, and the nail polish remover pads are genius! They also make great gifts for girls&#x27; birthday parties, slumber parties, goodie bags, etc.  I can&#x27;t wait to try different designs with this polish!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy all the colors. The only problem I have is with the packaging. They come packaged in 6 small boxes inside a big one. One of my nail polishes were broken, but I believe that&#x27;s because of the way the mail carrier handles its packages. I would like to have had them come with bubble wrap just for some more production</li>
    <li> I got my nail polishes in very quickly, even though it wasn&#x27;t supposed to come in for 2 weeks. There is such an amazing variety of colors, and I am very happy with this purchase. I am a bit of a nail polish junky, and this will definitely give me a fix for a few months ;)</li>
    <li> Great variety,  lots of different colors to choose from.  Great produce for the price.  Hard to find this many colors for this price!</li>
    <li> The nail polishes come individually wrapped so it&#x27;s a little process just to see them all but it&#x27;s TOTALLY WORTH IT. The nail polishes are high quality and you can&#x27;t beat the price. The nail polish removers have cuticle oil so they are good for your nails but they aren&#x27;t effective on the glitter polishes. It&#x27;s about half glitter polish and half regular colors. You don&#x27;t get a lot of the colors from the picture but you still get a pretty good deal.</li>
    <li> Great colors.  They need thinning for decent application though.  These chip after two days on my natural nails, but this not uncommon for me.  Stronger smelling polish.  Not my holy grail polish, but a fun polish for doing my little girls nails or pedicures where the polish lasts longer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t actually wear nail polish.  But I got this for my daughter for Christmas.  My step daughter was wrapping gifts for me and when she saw this she flipped out in amazement.  I felt bad I didn&#x27;t get her this too, but now it&#x27;s too late.  At least for Christmas.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a great deal. First of all , I should mention, that delivery time and all of that comes from the seller, not the product itself. I purchased from Flossy Cosmetics: a few notes on what the seller brought to the table&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. each item was individually wrapped in paper to prevent breakage&lt;br /&gt;2. I was able to email the seller and ask for particular colors, and although the delivery was late, and I didn&#x27;t get all the colors I asked for, all it took was a quick email, and he is sending the replacement colors for free.&lt;br /&gt;3. The seller was mostly quick to respond to emails&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the product itself&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1. great variety, lots of glitters and solids&lt;br /&gt;2. not necessarily colors I would have bought in a store, but so glad i got them... it widens my range for stamping polishes.&lt;br /&gt;3. good size bottle, like an OPI or Fingerpaints, not small like Essie or Zoya&lt;br /&gt;4. good formula, two or three coaters, which is a completely respectable formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1. the smell is beyond awful..... I mean truly terrible..... if you are sensitive, you may want to reconsider. I knew this going in, and I don&#x27;t care about it at all.... but it&#x27;s something that should at least be mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;2. Yes there is a lot of glitters, i see this as a pro, but some might think this is too childish.. personally i&#x27;m a huge fan of glitter and anything fun :) and I&#x27;m an adult with a corporate job.&lt;br /&gt;3. mine came with a black and white, I see in other reviews, a lot of people who DIDN&#x27;T get these saw these as a negative, but I would rather have gotten two other colors instead..... I&#x27;m a polish horder with a stash of over 200 bottles already, so I of course already had plenty black and white.&lt;br /&gt;4. I had one bottle where the polish had separated... it wasn&#x27;t one of my favorite colors from the batch anyways.... and since these were so cheap, i didn&#x27;t really care.</li>
    <li> Best thing I have ever bought, nail polish is great except for the clear which makes the polish look a little dull but besides that everything is great.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness. I got mine yesterday and am so pleased. The colors are vibrant and unique. It just made my day when it arrrived (on time I should mention). I cant see any problems with the exception of the polish removers. What was that about? They very much do not work. They smell good but in my opinion they dont do anything. To me seem dried out.. maybe im doing it wrong. I will get back to praising the product though. It was a great buy and I reccomend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product i got for my wife an she loved it it was very good i bought it as a birthday gift and because she has recenhly started nail skool</li>
    <li> It was an awesome deal! it came in 4 days.. and they didnt break!!! I am amazed at all the colors i got! Doesnt take too long to dry either!</li>
    <li> Great deal on time and daughter loves.</li>
    <li> Okay so I just received this package and I was pleased with all the pretty colors. I rated this a four star instead of five only because two of the polishes were leaking. Although this package ship a ways to get to customers I feel that no one wants to receive a something that they paid for damaged or leaking. Wasn&#x27;t a lot of leaking to the point where I wouldn&#x27;t recommend (and believe me I&#x27;m picky). I would recommend this product. Love the colors! As far as nail polish remover I think the scents are too strong and they are more likely to be for little girls not grown woman. But that&#x27;s okay I have daughters :)</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiful and they all came without any damage!  There were no duplicates of any colors and if you&#x27;re thinking about buying them, go ahead! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Up until about 3 years ago, I bit my nails. Once I finally got around to stopping that, I started caring for them and collecting nail polishes. So when my birthday rolled around this year, this is what I requested. 48 bottles for 40 bucks, including shipping, that&#x27;s a pretty fabulous deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered them late in the evening (around 10pm or so) on Monday, July 8 from MissPinkCat. I got my email notification the next day that they had been shipped, and I found my box on my porch today, Saturday, July 13. Incredibly fast shipping, especially considering the shipping cost me nothing. They were shipped in 8 boxes of 6, none were broken, although I think a couple of them had leaked or something; there was polish on the bottle itself. Not a big deal, they were all full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto the polishes themselves. They&#x27;re fabulous. I didn&#x27;t get a single duplicate, and there&#x27;s a lot of different colors. I only got one red, which isn&#x27;t a problem to me, I very rarely wear red. I only got one holo color, which did disappoint me a bit, but it&#x27;s so gorgeous I can&#x27;t be angry about it. Lots of chunky glitters (I counted 9) and lots of normal glittery ones. It&#x27;s a great range of colors, and I definitely couldn&#x27;t be happier about that. There are about 5 total that I don&#x27;t really see myself wearing; I&#x27;ve already decided to regift those to the fellow nail polish lovers in my family. I don&#x27;t find the smell that overwhelming, they just smell like nail polish to me. I was initially disappointed that I only got a hardener, and no top coat, but after applying the hardener to the polish I already had on, I was pleased to discover that it&#x27;s perfectly clear and can easily be used as a top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the remover pads, I simply haven&#x27;t tried them yet, although the scented part is definitely true. They smell nice, for nail polish remover at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely, definitely buy this set again.. as long as I was guaranteed to get 48 more colors. If you&#x27;re considering buying this, it&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I&#x27;ve had these for a few days now, and tried out several colors as well as the remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I like the little remover pads. They don&#x27;t work as well as advertised, no, but generally I get one hand removed per one pad. They do leave an oily residue behind, but honestly, a quick go-over with a baby wipe took care of that for me. No weird white streaks or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the nail polishes themselves go, I am incredibly pleased. They are bright and vibrant, and they&#x27;re thick enough you could probably get away with one coat. They dried quickly by my standards, less than 5 minutes per coat, regardless of whether I&#x27;d put them in front of a fan like normal or not. My only complaint is that the one holo color I received was more of a topcoat than an actual polish, which is incredibly disappointing. As I&#x27;ve said before, the color itself is completely gorgeous, and I&#x27;d love to be able to just have that on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as chipping goes.. I&#x27;ve used 3 different colors, had them on for at least 24 hours, and the only chipping problems I&#x27;ve had were caused by my own stupidity -- trying to pick food out of my teeth with my nails, for instance. I&#x27;ve showered, done dishes, typed like a maniac, and all around been hard on my nails, and the polish has held up perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have no complaints about the smell at all. I&#x27;ve been doing my nails in a small, completely closed off basement room, (no windows, the only ventilation is my a/c duct), and it&#x27;s not nearly as bad as some other nail polishes I own. I&#x27;d assume if someone is sensitive to smells this would bother them, as the smell is kind of strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I could be slightly happier with my purchase; I&#x27;d have liked more holo colors, and a deeper color to the one I did get, but none of that is enough to lose a star as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
    <li> I ordered these and received them just today! I opened up the box and each nail polish was wrapped individually and very well protected to prevent them from breaking during delivery. Each time I unwrapped one I was amazed at the color. I can honestly say that there was not a color in here that I wasn&#x27;t impressed with. After all of that I decided to try all the colors out on my nails, all of them went on smoothly and a lot of the ones I figured I would need a few coats on actually only needed one! I don&#x27;t know how well they stay on yet but i&#x27;m going to use one of them tonight to do my nails. I don&#x27;t care much about chipping because I paint my nails about 4 times a week. All in all...GREAT product. If I would have received this as a gift I would have been thrilled!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this product! I received A LOT of duplicate colors! Also from the picture i thought there would be more solid colors than there were. Most of them were gaudy glittery colors with different shapes in them (stars, hearts....not my taste...gave them to my little cousin).</li>
    <li> thank you, great price, wonderful colors,daughter will definately enjoy items for a long time,will save  seller for future buying options.</li>
    <li> Great Colors!! Fast Shipping</li>
    <li> I did not recevie the nail remover pads as indicated.i did not rececive mamy of the color that were displayed in advertisig picture.i recived 9-10  shades. Some of tha colors that i recived very similar. Plz give me nail remover pads and some glliter color nail polish.</li>
    <li> I got this for my sister for a Christmas gift. She was buying individual bottles for anywhere from a few dollars to $10 a piece. I saw the reviews and the quality comments so I thought I would get it and she loves it. It has a wonderful array of colors and the polishes appear to be well made.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter on Saturday the 21st hoping to get it by the 24th in time for Christmas.  I knew there was a chance that I wouldn&#x27;t get it on time and I didn&#x27;t I received it on the 26th.  This was fine with me because I got this for my 8 year old daughter and figured that if I didn&#x27;t get it on time then I would give it to her for her Birthday in May (yeah its a little far out, but hey it never hurts to have a jump on your shopping) I opened the box and was blown away I could not believe all of the different color choices and the bottles were a nice standard size.  She is going to be blwon away when she gets this and I could not be happier with my purchase and the speedy delivery.  This is s must buy for kids and adults (I know I will be using them too)</li>
    <li> Decent selection of colors. Actually prettier than I expected. One polish came completely unusable: half empty and all gunky and thick in the bottom but only one garbage out of 48 nail polishes isn&#x27;t too bad. It is a gift so it hasn&#x27;t been used yet (it&#x27;s not Christmas yet) but I did try one color on my thumb to check it out. Good pigmentation but it took a LONG time to dry. I will see how chip resistant it is. I doubt it will last long but my target audience is teenage girls who change their nails every few days so that is ok.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, seems ok but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for classy nails instead of cute colors to play around with.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this bundle so much, the variety of colors is simply amazing, the shipping was super fast and the way it was packed spot on.</li>
    <li> Great collars great price but chips so EASY!!!&lt;br /&gt;One day nail polish at best!!!&lt;br /&gt;If the polish wouldn&#x27;t chip I would give it 5 stars</li>
    <li> When I ordered them they said it would take two weeks, I got them way sooner then that! I was in love with all the colors, this really was a good buy!!! Over all i&#x27;m a pretty happy costumer!</li>
    <li> Love the colors, goes on smooth.</li>
    <li> I got these as a gift for my sister, and the quality is great! The packaging was done very nicely, and they all came intact. I received no duplicates.</li>
    <li> First of all I&#x27;m amazed that my package arrived in like 3-4 days even though it says it will take about a week. Secondly, normally when you place an order online and it arrives it&#x27;s not totally what you expected, you&#x27;re somewhat let down. Not with this package. I was smiling ear to ear with how many amazing colors there are. You won&#x27;t regret it</li>
    <li> I LOVE this purchase. I received so many awesome colors and in a timely manner. The smell IS as bad as all the reviews say. It is pretty darn strong. But, the polish is good and stays on for a while. I think it&#x27;s rad I have all these colors now!</li>
    <li> It took so long to get to.my house &amp; the polish dries slooowww but so many pretty Colors and if you are willing to wait for it to dry then this item would be for you</li>
    <li> they just came todaysupposed to come January 7th came four days earlier I&#x27;m so excited and all them came and all the cars are really really pretty and not clumpy I think it was worth the price and you should totally buy it if you like nail polish😊😀😁😁😂</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this set.  There were only two colors out of the entire set that I wouldn&#x27;t consider wearing.  There were several different top-coats with different effects such as matte or glitter.  Out of all the colors there were only 2 that were too close in color to tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;So far, the color wears really well.  It lasts well without chipping at the edges which says a lot since most polish chips on me since I spend my entire work day typing, filing, and other tasks that are hard on nail polish.</li>
    <li> I love these finger nail polishes. There were only 8 out of the 48 that I didn&#x27;t like but that&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t like Gold nail polishes. But the colors are amazing and I was really happy with the way they were packaged and shipped! I would highly recommend this product! :)</li>
    <li> Great product for the amount of money you are paying. Got all different colors and it was amazing. The only down fall was that the nail polish comes off after 2 days but it is still great.</li>
    <li> LOVE EVERYTHING ,WONDERFUL PACKING AND FAST SHIPPING...</li>
    <li> I got these polishes for less than $1 a bottle shipped.  They were individually wrapped and none of mine were broken when received.  The colors are vibrant (except for &#x27;fashionista&#x27;.  Yuck!  More like zombie green.  lol) and I got no duplicates.  My little girls are elated and I could do all of our toes and fingers on each of us in a different color and still have extras to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good value.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd year we have bought this.  My wife does her nails very, very often and absolutely loved this for her Christmas present last year --- so much so that she had me buy it for her again this year.  She does her nails when we watch TV and this stuff does not smell like her other nail polish did.  In fact, I sometimes don&#x27;t realize that she is using it.  I love it (and so does she).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We live in a remote area of Montana where assortments like this just aren&#x27;t available.  SInce we drive 60 miles one-way to any stores (and, with the cost of gas and our time) Amazon with FREE delivery within 48 hours right to our door is a no-brainer.</li>
    <li> I was fooled by the picture thinking I was going to get all those beautiful colors. Instead I got a lot of the same shades! ALOT of orange,pink,green and so on! Oh! And a lot of glitter polishes which I gave to my little cousin! But I do like them. I found this same brand on sale at a flea market for a $1 so I made up for all the colors that I thought I would&#x27;ve had already.</li>
    <li> Great service, fast delivery,and all the colors are really pretty. Its a good price for the quality. Im so glad i bought this set!</li>
    <li> awesome bday gift! the girls loved them! grabbed a couple for a few other friends! shipping was fast and each bottle was individually wrapped!</li>
    <li> A host of colors great for a budding stylist or just to have around the house.  Even comes with 3 scented nail polish remover</li>
    <li> The one complaint I have is the packaging.  They&#x27;re shipped in smaller boxes (6 per small box) within a larger box with a bubble-wrap envelope at the bottom only.  I know they changed their packaging from individually wrapping each bottle with some sort of cushy foam netting, which I&#x27;m sure would have prevented some of the leakage from some of the bottles a little better than just being thinly boxed for the roughage of shipping, and no real cushioning.  None of them emptied or came up broken, but I noticed some dripping on the sides of about 4-6 bottles once I opened everything up and one in particular had been left with 3/4 of the bottle from the leaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the from the packaging, the nail polish is great!  No repeats, lots of different glitters, chromes and neons, all unique.  You also get some of the Chunky Holo polishes, which is awesome.  Great for those just collecting polishes or those wanting to add some unique shades and glitters to their collection.  Totally worth it, just wish the packaging was a bit more insuring.</li>
    <li> I got 3 bottles of clear. About 4 of them are separated. Thats not so great. But overall, good price for a good product</li>
    <li> Never will i ever buy anything like this again. The polishes i got were near expired and were super thick and smelled even worse than nail polish. Not to mention 2 of my polishes came shattered.</li>
    <li> I am truly a nail polish addict and this is my first time with Kleancolor polishes but I AM IN LOVE!!! I opened up the box and each nail polish was wrapped individually and very well protected to prevent them from breaking during delivery. Each time I unwrapped one I was amazed at the color. I can honestly say that there was not a color in here that I wasn&#x27;t impressed with. After all of that I decided to try all the colors out on my nails, all of them went on smoothly and a lot of the ones I figured I would need a few coats on actually only needed one! I don&#x27;t know how well they stay on yet but i&#x27;m going to use one of them tonight to do my nails. I only got 1 color repeated but anyways, I am happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Shipped out in a good amount of time. Nothing was broken!! I&#x27;m most happy about that because I read some reviews that had said that so I was worried but everything was fine. Didn&#x27;t repeat any colors and gave me a nice selection of colors. Only thing is it takes a while to dry. I did my toes in the night time and only did 2 coats and I worked out in the morning and the sneakers smushed the front part of my big toe. Wasn&#x27;t happy about that so maybe I&#x27;ll try one coat next time. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and I might buy another set for myself just because I love nail polish &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> i just received my order and i&#x27;m sooooooooooo happy with it . i love every color . there are some colors i wasn&#x27;t expecting but i still love them all</li>
    <li> I was happy to find that I had all different colors and about 9 glitter ones. When you apply them you&#x27;ll have to add about 3 layers of polish to get the color. I was dissapointed to see that there was not a white poish. They do apply streaky. I do love my set but would definately buy a different brand next time.</li>
    <li> Love the colors, stays on my nail for a long time too!! and the smell isnt horribly bad. Most colors actually only need 1 coat and a clear coat, only bad thing is that it takes forever to dry!!&lt;br /&gt;The nail polish remover pads that came with it work great too!! loved they didnt have that horrible acetone smell!!!</li>
    <li> I am very please with this set!  I sent in my order and within a few days the polishes were sitting on my door step waiting for me, way before the quoted delivery date. : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a very nice variety of polishes (flat, shimmery, glitters, metallic, holo glitters - some dark colors, some light sheers, some bright colors).  I absolutely love the holo glitters, especially holo chrome!  I got 47 different colors - got one color twice, but it&#x27;s a beautiful shimmery purple and my roommate LOVES purple.. so she was happy to get the extra one!  Application is smooth, it doesn&#x27;t take very long for each coat to dry, and most colors I&#x27;ve tried out seem to do the job in only 1-2 coats anyways.  The nail polish removers are very cool!  I&#x27;ve never used anything like them before.. and they do seem oily when you use them, but I&#x27;m happy about the cuticle oil in it and the fact that my hands aren&#x27;t getting all dried out.  They work fairly well at removing layers of polish off pretty fast, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very interested in purchasing this set again - yet I was afraid of getting several duplicates.  After looking at all of the colors available on their website, I just had to know if I could request specific colors for my next order.  They emailed me back very quickly saying that I could send a list of colors I&#x27;d like along with my order.  Very happy about this and I will be purchasing more colors in the future!</li>
    <li> Just got my package and absolutely LOVE the colors.  No duplicates and I received all the holo colors:-) Ordering another set now.</li>
    <li> one of the polish as every where but other than that it was find and thank you guys and girls</li>
    <li> Beautiful.  I will repeat the order.  Everything was perfect.  Very satisfied.  It was everything I expected.  I give it five stars</li>
    <li> I am a professional nail tech in the las vegas area. I definitely approve these polishes! They work magnificently and they last long. Great product!</li>
    <li> I like all the colors, the polish it&#x27;s very good. It doesn&#x27;t peel out of your nails very easily. It has cute colors and includes a mate polish that it&#x27;s beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I notice is that if you are trying nail art with it, you have to let it dry really really well or it is going to mix up with the other colors even when you think is dry.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the purchase, very good product for a very good price!</li>
    <li> this may be just my personal experience but there were all multiple of the same colors some of the bottles were leaking and cracked,there was only one maybe two or three colors that were pretty the rest were very dull ugly brown and weird colors and there were so many of the same color I only got one or two glitters and there were four five of the same glitters I would not recommend buying this from personal experience it was it worth my time and effort to send it back but I would recommend not buying this product I wouldn&#x27;t take my chances on getting all the same colors unless you plan on giving them away</li>
    <li> nice selection of colors, not so great polish quality</li>
    <li> It smells a bit stronger than regular nail polish, yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the nail polish remover was perfect - I had on a base coat, 2 coats of nail polish and a top coat and was able to get 4 fingers (thumb included) with one pad.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t get 5 per pad is because I used Martha Stewart glitter on my ring fingernail and had to literally soak my nail in acetone to get that stuff off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used one of the polishes so far (Bikini Green) and am extremely impressed.  It&#x27;s a lighter mint green/lime green type color so I did have to use three coats.  This stuff dries FAST!  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just this particular color, but I literally put the third coat on about 5 minutes ago and here I am typing this review.  I&#x27;m not going to risk it and run into the kitchen to do the dishes or anything, but I&#x27;m not prisoner to my nails for the next half an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for how it was packaged, I was totally fine with it.  None of the tops of my polishes were chipped, none of the bottles broken - it looked like one of them leaked, but whatever.  They wrap 8 bottles together comparable to how chicken drumsticks are packaged about 5 times with bubble wrap and tape.  It&#x27;s in a perfectly sized box so they&#x27;re not moving around everywhere - I think they did the best they could given the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase from this seller again, and I would purchase these polishes - especially at the price.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about buying this product because everyone was saying that their were color repeats and broken nail polish, but mine were perfectly fine I love all the colors even the colors i would never use, but they will come in handy. I never used this nail polish brand before, but its always good to try new things.</li>
    <li> Got my polish after 3 days. I loved how the packed everything nice and neat. And yes, I love all the colors!</li>
    <li> With shipping and everything added up, each bottle comes at less than two dollars each! &amp; Free nail remover pads.. The colors are amazing, especially the holos and the variety of glitter flakes. While I guess you could see not knowing exactly what colors you are getting as a downfall I found it made getting and opening my order more fun lol. The reason I bought this order was because I knew I would be getting a full spectrum of colors, I have a habit when I shop for polish of staying within a set range of colors unintentionally, so yes there are a few colors that maybe I wouldnt have chosen singled out at the store but I know I will make use of all of them. The quality is great, I did get the matte top coat which I was crossing my fingers would come with as I saw lots of others got that as well. It works great! Also, there was only one or two pairs of polish that were pretty close to each other but I did not get any duplicates and my set was a bit heavy on the reds/pinks. Just waiting for my Pueen stamping set so I can really make use of all these colors now.</li>
    <li> I received my package in a timely manner, packaging was perfect, no broken or leaking bottles.  There were a couple of bottles that looked like duplicates but they were just a shade lighter or darker.  The polish goes on smooth and thick, on some of the colors I could get away with only 1 coat.  Dries quickly.  I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend the product and seller!</li>
    <li> Great deal...nice variety. Packaged in such a way that it could be used as several small gifts. I am planning on purchasing more for my daughter&#x27;s friends.</li>
    <li> I too was leery about this buy but decided to take a chance. Once I opened the box I was extremely happy! About the packaging, I received them in KleanColor box sets of 6. The box was set up with 3 box sets in each rowx2 with plastic bubble wrap in between each row which did the job since none of my polishes came broken. The top row had the three round nail polish remover packs the filled the remainder of the space. In my opinion it all fit well and was properly packaged. The nail polish removers: These are round pads moistened with remover and cuticle oil, they were a little too oily and not enough remover for my taste but it was an easy fix (just pour a tiny more remover in the container and voila, works great!) The POLISHES: I got TONS of gorgeous colors, several different shades and finishes such as creams, chunky holos, neon&#x27;s, shimmers, glitters, and metallic&#x27;s. There was only 1 polish I found to be kind of ugly, it&#x27;s this ugly poop brown. I also received a matte finish glitter and the madly matte top coat (which I must say is awesome, no streaks or cloudy look, comparable to china glaze&#x27;s and Opi&#x27;s matte top coat which was a great surprise). None were repeated, and duplicated colors with different names. I would buy another one if I could guarantee I wouldn&#x27;t get too many dups. But the seller hasn&#x27;t answered my inquiry regarding this as of yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a stronger than a lot of other polishes Ive worked with and can be overpowering if in a small non ventilated room but honestly I wasn&#x27;t knocked down by the odor. It is what it is, but definitely not a deterrent from buying in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it was an awesome buy for anyone looking to add to their collection or begin one!</li>
    <li> My mom got this for me for my birthday and I can honestly say that it is worth more than 5 stars.  We got it in 2 days, and the colors are all so pretty.  These will keep me in bright nail polish for months.  The polish is thick, but that is good for the water marbling and if I am not marbling, it seems to require less coats.  I would like this present for every birthday!!</li>
    <li> These polishes are actually a lot better then i had expected. The brand is kleancolor, and all of there polishes are very pretty. The whole set was about half glitter and half solid. I got most of the metallic&#x27;s and neon&#x27;s and a lot of the pearl one&#x27;s as well. However, i did not get the Holo-chrome, i was a little disappointed with that. But, as a whole set i would definitely recommend this product. Also, i ordered this set on Feb 6th and i received it today on Feb 11th, the estimated delivery date wasn&#x27;t until Feb 13th - 28th. Very pleased. :)</li>
    <li> TAkes forever to dry. Has strong smell. But great colour variety.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for 3 of my nieces.  I was able to split the 48 polishes evenly between three girls, and still give them each the same colors but slightly varied in shades.  Great variety of colors.  Lots of different types of glitters for those who like glitter.  I was tempted to purchase a set for myself, but i don&#x27;t really need all that polish.  Luckily I was given back a few for my own personal use.  They work well, last fairly well like any other polish.</li>
    <li> I received my package a little ahead of time, which I was really excited about...the colors were intact (I had 0 broken or dried up bottles). The selection of colors was good...I got a good mix of metallic, bright, pastel and glitter polishes. The ones I got were the same brand that my nail salon uses so the quality of most of the polishes was excellent. The only reason that I&#x27;m giving this product a 4 stars, instead of five is because of the glitter polishes (with large glitter). My daughters went strait to these polishes but they are horrible. The base is too sticky and it rubs off too easily. I kinda wish these weren&#x27;t included because I wont use them. Other than that, this was a great buy to grow a polish collection, on a budget.</li>
    <li> My sister was so shocked when I got her these nail polish. There&#x27;s so many different colors to choose from and she told me. She doesn&#x27;t even know where to start on what color to use. I&#x27;m very pleased with the shipping and handling too. It came a day early.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this purchase. My item arrived so quickly and packaged with great care. No broken bottles, no dried out colors, and all the bottles are labeled with the names of the color. There were no duplicate colors and there is even a matte polish finisher. The product is Kleen colors which is nice and thick, lasts a long time and opaque enough to work with the stamping plates. Although there are a couple of colors that don&#x27;t work well with my skin tone, it is fun to overlap and mix looks with the stamping plates. Thanks So Much!</li>
    <li> Yes, its true! I ordered this package 2 days before it was delivered, which was a huge surprise, because it said it would take a week or more until it would come! So for that I was delighted!&lt;br /&gt;Each bottle came in a plastic blue net, and all were neatly piled in the foam peanuts! None were cracked, ruined, dry or anything. I also didnt get ANY duplicates!!! In the box I received every color I had hoped for, and it came with a bunch of holos, chunkys, neons, LOTS of sparkles, shiny, mattes, and a base coat! I am very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> I love these polishes. They are not exactly up to pair with Essie, Orly, or China Glaze - But for the price, they are definitely better than other polishes of the price range. They go on smooth, nice pigmentation, amazing fun colors! My only complaint with the quality is that they take a very long time to dry. And I don&#x27;t mean that they are wet, persay... but I noticed that after a few hours they don&#x27;t set as hard and are liable to nick a little easier than high end nail polish - that being said , for a large set of nail polishes you want to match different outfits or maybe for a teen girl - This is great!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even better than the price and quality of the nail polishes is the customer service. They were awesome. They allowed me to request some colors I really wanted from the line up (It&#x27;s from Kleancolor if you want to see swatches via google). And when my package arrived with 47 polishes, a shot them a quick email and they immediately shipped out the extra with many apologies. I would definitely buy from again if I needed more polishes or wanted a gift idea!</li>
    <li> Ok so I&#x27;m only 12 and I really like doing my nail so I had to do chores for like EVER!  So finnaly got enough money t get them it took like 5 days to get here but that&#x27;s ok :) but when I got here I was like so excited!! 2 were broken but it was pinks so I wasn&#x27;t that upset there was lots of neons and glitters and metallics I use them like everyday and the brand is kleacolor</li>
    <li> purchased this along with other nail products for my grand daughter as a gift She loves all of them, she was surprised of all the different colors.</li>
    <li> Got this for my &#x27;tween niece.  She absolutely loved it!  (her father not so much...some of the colors are pretty intense) The first thing she did was paint each nail....fingers and toes a different color.</li>
    <li> There is definitely a large variety of colors in this set, and the price for the amount is nice, with that being said the quality left something to be desired. One bottle arrived opened with contents spelt, but with the amount received I wasn&#x27;t too concerned with it. The regular polish itself takes a very long time to dry and comes off very easily. The textured polish does last a bit longer, and does dry faster. I will spend a bit more in the future for better quality polish.</li>
    <li> Out of the 48 bottles, I gave away 2 to my BFF as they were duplicates. Super happy with my purchase. My daughter is equally happy. She has a lot of colors to choose from. Her latest? Green. My latest? Metallic Yellow with a Gold Glitter gradient :)</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time. I like most of the colors except for about four. Nice vibrant colors. The glitter polishes are my favorite.  They arrived in eight individual boxes. I did not have any duplicate colors. I feel like this was a very good deal.</li>
    <li> My niece wanted nail polish for Christmas and this exceeded our expectations.  The colors were great and so many.  She will never have another outfit that she doesn&#x27;t have the right polish for!  The metals were cool, as was the matte finish topcoat that came.  The packing was great and the shipping was super fast considering it was Christmas time and there was a huge storm that slowed everything down.  Very, very happy!!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a christmas gift for my girlfriend, she liked the variety of colors and the fact that there was only 1 repeated color and it was a pink so she didn&#x27;t mind anyway!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only 1 bottle had leaked a little by the cap and I was told it&#x27;s a fairly nice brand. Not the best brand out there but certainly not this worst either!</li>
    <li> Two of the colors I got double of but they are such a pretty color that im ok with that all the other colors are different I love the variety I was worried I would not get a whit so I was super excited to get both a plain white along with a sparkly white this was such a great selection that I would buy them again!!!</li>
    <li> The order came late, two of the polishes had leaked out due to poor wrapping. I did not receive the remover pads as indicated. Polishes are nice and dry quickly, but the customer service is very bad!</li>
    <li> Color selection is great. Quality of polish seems good and we did receive 48 different colors. I bought the resin polish stand also, like you see at the nail salon to keep these on and thru this site we found many accesories so now I can save 100.00 every 2 weeks as I have 3 daughters who love getting mani pedis. We have our own salon at home now!!</li>
    <li> Really nice.  I was worried, but this product came in excellent condition.  Lots of fab colors and no broken bottles or leakage.</li>
    <li> I was happy with the colors of polish. Not very happy with the quality. It doesn&#x27;t last very long. The free nail polish remover pads it came with are amazing!</li>
    <li> I recieved this item ahead of schedule, which i did not expect reading the other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the nail polish is decent (lasts approx 5 -6 days without chipping and no top or base coats.(Quick drying)&lt;br /&gt;There also was not a single duplicate bottle, there wasnt an abundance of glitters which i had expected reading other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Only issue i had with packaging was one bottle hadnt been secured properly and was leaking (orange not a big deal to me)&lt;br /&gt;All in all Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 11 year old granddaughter for her birthday. She wanted a few bottles of fingernail polish for her birthday. Boy was she surprised when she opened this. There is a wide variety of colors and even some glitter ones. She loves it.</li>
    <li> I order this for my daughter&#x27;s birthday and she loves it. Only one is slight open and the rest is intact. She loves all the color too.</li>
    <li> They arrived on time and oh my gosh, none were broken, no duplicate colors and wow with one coat vibrant colors. LOVE these best purchase ever!!!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to ask for this for my birthday considering it was a package of 48 nail polishes from a brand I had never used but I figured, why not. For less than a dollar a bottle, it&#x27;s worth it. And so far it appears it has been. The package arrived yesterday and everything was very neatly packaged. The nail polishes came in separate smaller boxes which held 6 polishes each, each with a divider in between. No bottles were broken or leaking. Out of 48 nail polishes, I only received one duplicate, called Mix Signal. Also out of the 48, there were about 10 that I couldn&#x27;t see myself wearing, so I gave the ones I wouldn&#x27;t wear to my mother and sister (and none of us wear yellow so I still am holding onto that one). The following is a list of the ones I didn&#x27;t want, including the duplicate:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Sheer Pastel Cocoa&lt;br /&gt;2. Pinky Moon*&lt;br /&gt;3. Sheer Peach&lt;br /&gt;4. Twinkly Love&lt;br /&gt;5. Pastel Pink&lt;br /&gt;6. Coffee Addict&lt;br /&gt;7. Berry Burst&lt;br /&gt;8. Funky Yellow&lt;br /&gt;9. Mix Signal*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also compiled a list of the rest, to give an idea of what a package may contain. I found it helpful that some other people did this also, just to know what to expect. While there are quite a few pinks, I was overall quite pleased with the variety of styles and colors. I&#x27;m a big fan of glitter and I just can&#x27;t wait to try all the ones that have big glitter pieces in them, and there are quite a few! I&#x27;ve marked them with an asterisk. I also received one matte color, which is the last one on the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m currently wearing Metallic Fuschia with an accent nail of Grand Finale and the color is very vibrant and just lovely. (As for the rest, I have just made quick swatches with them to see what they&#x27;d look like.) While the scent is a bit stronger than your average nail polish, I think this purchase was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;10. Red-Hot*&lt;br /&gt;11. Metallic Red&lt;br /&gt;12. Pink&lt;br /&gt;13. Pink Star&lt;br /&gt;14. Sheer Pink&lt;br /&gt;15. Pearl Pink&lt;br /&gt;16. Metallic Pink&lt;br /&gt;17. Sparkling Cosmos*&lt;br /&gt;18. Mix Signal*&lt;br /&gt;19. 2-2 Tango*&lt;br /&gt;20. Take A Hint*&lt;br /&gt;21. Metallic Orange&lt;br /&gt;22. Metallic Mango (21 &amp; 22 are quite similar, but there is a difference)&lt;br /&gt;23. Holo Orange&lt;br /&gt;24. Golden Nirvana*&lt;br /&gt;25. Chunky Copper*&lt;br /&gt;26. Gold Caviar*&lt;br /&gt;27. Neon Yellow&lt;br /&gt;28. Metallic Yellow&lt;br /&gt;29. Metallic Green&lt;br /&gt;30. Green With Envy*&lt;br /&gt;31. Metallic Aqua&lt;br /&gt;32. Sapphire&lt;br /&gt;33. Metallic Sapphire&lt;br /&gt;34. Blue-Eyed Girl*&lt;br /&gt;35. Holo Chrome&lt;br /&gt;36. Pastel Purple&lt;br /&gt;37. Metallic Purple&lt;br /&gt;38. Metallic Fuschia&lt;br /&gt;39. Born To The Purple*&lt;br /&gt;40. Sugar Coat*&lt;br /&gt;41. Grand Finale*&lt;br /&gt;42. Bridal Shower*&lt;br /&gt;43. Silver&lt;br /&gt;44. Metallic White&lt;br /&gt;45. Black&lt;br /&gt;46. Metallic Black&lt;br /&gt;47. Black Out*&lt;br /&gt;48. Cherry Mocha (matte)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the nail polish removers, they were pretty nice. Yes a bit oily, but I think that&#x27;s to be expected because it does say with cuticle oil or something or other on the front of them. It&#x27;s really not that bad, but it&#x27;s also nothing you can&#x27;t get rid of by simply washing your hands afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a pretty great product and I can&#x27;t wait to use the rest of the colors. For someone who&#x27;s rather picky about nail polishes from time to time, I really like this product.</li>
    <li> Lots of great color variations. I purchased this a little too close to the date of when I needed it for a baby shower, but the customer service contact for the purchase was excellent. They turned my shipment around in no time and got it to me within a couple days of the date I needed. Excellent customer service. Packaging was excellent, very well packaged so there wouldn&#x27;t be any breaking of the bottles. Great price for the quantity you receive. I would def order this again.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t nail polish that you can wear for a long period of time as it is a little on the cheap side. I change my polish every other day so this was perfect for me. It arrived in a timely manner and was well packaged. Each polish was wrapped in a blue mesh to keep them from banging into one another and breaking. The nail polish remover isn&#x27;t that great and left oils on my nails. I did not care for them. I love the variety of nail polish!</li>
    <li> would absolutely purchase this again!! only got one duplicate color which is ok... I am going to write down the colors we received and order ones we didn&#x27;t get... pretty fast shipping and an easy transaction... the colors are great and the polish wears well ... I am very happy!!! and every bottle was packed nicely</li>
    <li> my daughter is at the age when you don&#x27;t know what to get her but this purchase right here was perfect for her</li>
    <li> Nice colors and appear to be of good quality. I used for a girls conference and will by from them again.</li>
    <li> Awesome nail polish quality, LITERALLY every color known to man and very fast shipping! Recommend this nail polish to everyone!!</li>
    <li> excellent loved me ... I give them 5 stars because it is perfect all came under the description</li>
    <li> Not a single repeat, awesome colors.. Kleancolor brand. They all show up exactly like in the bottle with one or two coats. I know all the shipments are different, but I got neons,matte,metallic,and everything in between. Only one glittery bottle, I was worried they would all be cheap glitter polishes. But I was happily mistaken. Mine do not work well for water marble, they are a little thicker but I plan to get Seche Restore and try that on them. Some colors go on a little streaky, but after two coats and a top coat they&#x27;re perfect. Definitely worth the money I paid for them. Was a little skeptical from some of the reviews. But I am 19, just got really into nail art.. And they are perfect for me so far. I really hope they thin up from the seche restore so that I can do marble with them too, they work great for everything else I&#x27;ve tried so far though! Love the variety, definitely recommend this product! great value.</li>
    <li> great colors, looks great. my family is having fun painting their nails. this is definitely quality nail polish. very happy with them.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this item. I brought it and was in love at first with all the different colors. But after applying the colors they were thick and wouldn&#x27;t last more than 3 hours on my nails. The polish starts to come off too quick and the material is not good. Instead, spend your money buying a good quality nail polish.</li>
    <li> I just got my package and ripped it open when it came ! NONE of my nail polish bottles broke or leaked. The colors are amazing. Some of them have a sticky consistency, but a majority of them are perfect. This is a MUST buy ! It&#x27;s only about 78 cents when you divide $37.35 by 48 colors. (: I now have almost 100 nail polish bottles including the ones I have now (:</li>
    <li> I was extremely let down upon looking through the colors because I didn&#x27;t receive many of the colors that were displayed in the advertising picture. I received approximately 8-9 shades of brown which was very upsetting because I purchased this assortment for all of portrayed colors. Even though I did not receive any repeats, some of the colors that I received were extremely similar.</li>
    <li> Love the palette, and how long it&#x27;s sticks to your nail.  And the price, of course... This brand is a bomb.</li>
    <li> These are awesome. Awesome deal - awesome price. Shipped very quickly and arrived in great shape. Also got a very good assortment with no doubles- I would definately order this again.</li>
    <li> These are a great buy and you get a lot of options with this order.  I would completely order from this again.</li>
    <li> Ultimately a gift for my teen daughter, but I was highly pleased when the polishes arrived to my door steps. Every polish was different, the polish remover wipes were just as cute as they could be. The package arrived on time, and more importantly, the polishes all have great coverage. This sizable package has drama, glitz, and playful colors that will suit all of my teen&#x27;s moods. (And that&#x27;s ever changing!) Thanks so much! And I&#x27;ll be shopping with this company again.</li>
    <li> Such a variety of colors. My daughter absolutely loves these polishes. Great quality for such an affordable price. Out standing.</li>
    <li> This is AWESOME for the price. I had all these nail polishes for about 2 years and they still work perfect.</li>
    <li> A few were open a little more than I like but only one spilled and the colors are awsome and you only need one coat and probly orded agin</li>
    <li> dont be deceived by the price these nail polishes are great quality ! and theres a lot of colors and sparkles ! i didnt get two of the same kind! I love them sooo much!</li>
    <li> great product only problem I had was that I had one broken bottle and also I had no repeat colors .</li>
    <li> Bought this for one daughter for Christmas, and it was such a hit that I bought it for another daughter this year. Contrary to other reviews this product was very well packaged and there were no duplicates. Also bought the nail polish table rack display from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t receive any duplicates which was nice but the nail polish smells terrible.  If you can get over the smell it&#x27;d be a great buy.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to get this and I got pretty much every color shown in the picture! Very fun and different colors, packaging was great and didn&#x27;t have any problems with broken bottles. Would defiently recommend this to a friend!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I will definitely order more of the colors that I did not receive. I had 5 duplicates but it is still worth the money and the scented nail polish removers are amazing!! Delighted</li>
    <li> i like it. product is good as expected. I am satisfied with this product and I have no complain about it.</li>
    <li> Nothing bad to say about this product or the sellers, my wife is enjoying it now as i I&#x27;m typing. Great product highly reccomend it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE all of these polishes, they arrived the next day. My only issue is the scented nail polish remover pads don&#x27;t really work.</li>
    <li> Grand daughter asked for this item on her Christmas list.  Was I surprised&lt;br /&gt;at the hugh selection of nail colors and so was she ( I think), never realized&lt;br /&gt;how many she would have to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She really likes her gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grand Mom Betty</li>
    <li> Very high quality polish.  Beautiful colors!  Bought the display case to go along with it.  Teens will love all the selections.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to open this package...it was like a rainbow in a box!!  The polish goes on smooth and lasts without chipping a long time.  I love the colors...very vibrant.  I would recommend these polishes to anyone!!</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly, My girlfriend loves the color selection and the variety of polishes. the polish is pretty chip resistant but like any should be applid with a base and a top coat. applies easily and smoothly. not cheap or thin like some other bargain brands.</li>
    <li> Got the package today, came in 6 boxes with 6 polishes in each. Had no repeats or broken ones. All were soo perfect, even came with a Matte topcoat!! :D The colors are so vibrant and not thin like some cheaply made polishes. For this price it&#x27;s a must, espically if your the type who loves DIY nail art at home!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a mission project. We go to assisted living homes and have a nail painting day. So far I am very happy with the polish. I tested it on myself to see the how long it would last, and I was shocked it lasted a week on my toes and probably longer but I needed to change colors. I am very happy. The remover works very well, my tried and true test red polish 1 pad took off the entire hand, it was work but red always is.</li>
    <li> I ordered this package on July 18th and I got it on July 26th and it did come in the estimated amount of time. When i received my package, the bottles of nail polish were very hot. Some of the bottles were not closed all the way... but, only two bottles leaked and they did not get on any of the other bottles. There were four different colors that I got duplicates of. Here is a list of the colors I got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7 Pearl Silver, 14 Neon Aqua, 15 Neon Sapphire, 16 Neon Purple, 17 Neon Green, 19 Neon Orange, 21 Neon Fuschia, 22 Barbie Pink, 23 Mango, 24 Bikini Green, 28 Chunky Silver, 29 Aurora, 30 Pinky Moon, 31 Silver Star, 33 Starry Blue, 38 Twinkly Love, 39 Fuschia Glitter, 41 Pearl Beige, 42 Sandstone, 43 Dessert, 44 Americano, 45 Copper, 47 Gold Bright, 52 Dark Brown, 53 Garnet Red, 85 Funky Yellow, 139 Pastel Pink, 141 Pastel Blue, 142 Pastel Teal, 143 Pastel Yellow, 204 Neon Lime, 228 Chunky Holo Candy, 230 Chunky Holo Fuschia, 231 Chunky Holo Scarlet, 232 Chunky Holo Clover, 233 Chunky Holo Teal, 236 Chunky Holo Black, 248 Mango Burst, 249 Mandarin Burst, 250 Sangria Burst, 251 Tangerine Burst, 252 Berry Burst, 253 Grape Burst, 265 Madly Black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tangerine Burst and the Berry Burst are almost exactly the same color. The ones I got duplicates of are Americano, Funky Yellow, Pastel Pink, and Pastel Blue. The ones that leaked were Neon Green and Chunky Holo Teal. Also, the Madly Black is a matte black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty impressed when I was opening the boxes of nail polish, but I wish I would have gotten more neon colors and I was hoping for a white and a clear top coat. I did contact the seller and ask if I could send the duplicates and the ones that leaked back and get new ones in return and they asked for pictures of all 6 bottles and so I sent them to the seller and they said thank you we will process your second shipment. So that was cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m okay with my order. Although, I expected a little more.</li>
    <li> I placed an order with this company thru and for a third party for the Kleancolor 100 color nail polish lot. I SPECIFICALLY requested certain colors. I received 55! colors I DID NOT REQUEST OR WANT INCLUDING 5 SETS OF DUPLICATES! upon contacting the seller for a resolution, the seller continually would ask for proof AFTER I provided the proof initially! After stating they would correct the problem they weaseled out of it by saying that No specific colors were requested! HOWEVER THEY DID MANAGE TO \\&quot;RANDOMLY\\&quot; GET 45! OF THE COLORS I DID REQUEST CORRECT INCLUDING SEVERAL SPECIFIC DUPLICATE COLORS I DID REQUEST! HOW CAN THAT BE POSSIBLE?! WHEN ACCORDING TO THEM NO COLORS WERE EVER REQUESTED?! VERY BAD BUSINESS! POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE! CHEATS THE CUSTOMER!</li>
    <li> I first fell in love with Kleancolor when I purchased some at the local jockey lot (Southern for flea market). I was debating on purchasing polishes online, because I&#x27;m a \\&quot;see for myself\\&quot; type, I like to see the colors in person.. but after much inner debate I purchased this set.  I was going to purchase a metallic set, but after watching YouTube reviews of this set and reading different reviews I concluded that there was a good chance that I&#x27;d get some of the metallic in this set.. anywho these are the polishes I received:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#53  Garnet Red (crème)&lt;br /&gt;#52  Dark Brown (crème)&lt;br /&gt;#77  Blood (crème)&lt;br /&gt;#79  Light Red (crème)&lt;br /&gt;#67  Pink Sleepers (crème)&lt;br /&gt;#68  Pink Star (shimmer/sheer)&lt;br /&gt;#16  Neon Purple&lt;br /&gt;#20  Neon Pink&lt;br /&gt;#17  Neon Green&lt;br /&gt;#85  Funky Yellow (neon)&lt;br /&gt;#14  Neon Aqua&lt;br /&gt;#21  Neon Fuchsia&lt;br /&gt;#24  Bikini Green (neon/pastel)&lt;br /&gt;#22  Barbie Pink (crème/neon)&lt;br /&gt;#19  Neon Orange&lt;br /&gt;#23  Mango (neon)&lt;br /&gt;#248 Mango Burst (neon)&lt;br /&gt;#18  Neon Yellow&lt;br /&gt;#168 Metallic Black&lt;br /&gt;#45  Copper&lt;br /&gt;#44  Americano (metallic)&lt;br /&gt;#7  Pearl Silver (metallic)&lt;br /&gt;#76  Jewelry Red (metallic)&lt;br /&gt;#161 Metallic Red&lt;br /&gt;#62  Fusion Pink (metallic/shimmer)&lt;br /&gt;#166 Metallic Fuchsia&lt;br /&gt;#164 Metallic Aqua&lt;br /&gt;#163 Metallic Green&lt;br /&gt;#47  Gold Bright (metallic)&lt;br /&gt;#162 Metallic Yellow&lt;br /&gt;#298 Get to Know Me (glitter)&lt;br /&gt;#306 Wear this Not That (glitter)&lt;br /&gt;#305 Luv U TEAL I Find Someone Better (glitter)&lt;br /&gt;#304 All That Glitters &amp; Glows (glitter)&lt;br /&gt;#300 Sequin Dress (glitter)&lt;br /&gt;#297 Almost Good As Gold (glitter)&lt;br /&gt;#301 Pacific Dream (glitter)&lt;br /&gt;#308 Mine &amp; Only (glitter)&lt;br /&gt;#307 Golden Rule of Fashion (glitter)&lt;br /&gt;#303 What A Steal! (glitter)&lt;br /&gt;#296 Sugar Cravings (glitter)&lt;br /&gt;#299 Love Madness (glitter)&lt;br /&gt;#228 Chunky Holo Candy (holographic)&lt;br /&gt;#230 Chunky Holo Fuchsia (holographic)&lt;br /&gt;#231 Chunky Holo Scarlett (holographic)&lt;br /&gt;#232 Chunky Holo Clover (holographic)&lt;br /&gt;#233 Chunky Holo Teal (holographic)&lt;br /&gt;#236 Chunky Holo Black (holographic)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Metallic: Ok y&#x27;all.. these polishes are absolutely beautiful!! (wish I would&#x27;ve gotten all metallic lol... they are nice and opaque with one coat.. totally love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neon:  They&#x27;re nice and bright, they do dry matte.. takes two coats to get desired coverage over a white base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crèmes: They are pretty, dry semi glossy.. couple of coats and you&#x27;re good to go.. except for the Pink Sleepers.. it&#x27;s pretty sheer kind of like a French manicure color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glitters:  They&#x27;re nice glitters, but some of the shredded glitters you&#x27;ll have to dab in place to get desired amount which tends to sometimes leave your polish thick and hard to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holographic:  These \\&quot;holo\\&quot; polishes are a bit of a hit and miss, they&#x27;re not very &#x27;holography&#x27; but they&#x27;re still nice.  The \\&quot;holo black\\&quot; is kind of like a glitter sandwich, kinda weird in my opinion but still cool nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My box also came with this little plastic \\&quot;rack\\&quot;, but I&#x27;m going to use the one part as a palate for my paints lol... oh, and it had the three nail polish remover pads.. I haven&#x27;t used them, I plan on giving them to my god daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging:  My polishes came in their own boxes, there were little thin pieces of cardboard between each polish.  That was all the protection they had in each individual box.  The bottom of the main box was lined with a padded envelope and the plastic \\&quot;rack\\&quot; was on top and the polish removers were in the middle.  None of my polishes were broken or leaking. (which I was worried about since my package was going cross country -California to South Carolina-) I also had no duplicates in my set. (yay!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this set is a nice addition to my collection.  If you&#x27;ve never tried Kleancolor polishes I highly recommend them.  :) This set equals about $0.80 a bottle.. so yeah, that&#x27;s fantastic in my opinion. :) Hope this review helped y&#x27;all!  :)</li>
    <li> The colors are great but i received two double bottles. None of my bottles broke while being shipped but i did have a few bottles that were not tightened and through shipping a little of my polish spilled. Other than the packaging, the colors are all great and they last pretty long on my fingers!</li>
    <li> best polish ever it&#x27;s so glossy and you only need one coat of most of them .the sheer polish is the best I&#x27;ve ever used,and the amount of colors you get is wonderful. the only problem is now i want them all 300 + !!!LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I received all polishes intact and I absolutely love the colors! By far a wonderful product! Have yet to try the nail polish remover pads!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product.  It dries funky, and doesn&#x27;t go on smooth at all.  Worst product I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
    <li> Got this for christmas for my daughter. Lots of different shades and none of the bottles were broken. thinking of ordering some for my niece..</li>
    <li> Awesome gift for the girlfriend lots of variety for a cheap price! Don&#x27;t think I saw any doubles.packaging was also very well.</li>
    <li> I read the product description and it states that no doubles will be sent. And I received three bottles of the same color and have messaged the buyer several times with no response. SO I WILL NOT order from them again unless they fix the order and take priority with their customer service.</li>
    <li> I am very very pleased with this set. No duplicates, good variety and I love the matte top coat + polish remover . I do wish there was some sort of a red in there but its not like I can&#x27;t just order red individually. Polish drys rather quick and i have not had a problem with any serious chipping or anything. I definately recommend this product . I will be ordering from them again.</li>
    <li> I am not a girly girl but I bought this for my girlfriend and she was really thrilled with the product. My mom was joking with my girl saying she&#x27;ll have polish till she&#x27;s 75. Althought she wasn&#x27;t happy with the remover stuff but she still loved all of the polish. I even got a pedi and a mani from my girlfriend so I guess she was that happy about it. She loved every color and she painted her nails about a good 5 times before she settled and she even went for a pink and she&#x27;s not fond of pink so I know she loves it if she used a pink!!! I&#x27;m happy if my gf is happy a happy girlfriend a happy life!!!! Some polish was leaked onto the bottle but not all the bottles and non of them looked broke!!! They came all boxed up and such!! Very happy</li>
    <li> Wide variety of colors, doesn&#x27;t smell up the entire house, and doesn&#x27;t peel. ( so far) the reviews I read said that they got a bunch of repeat colors, I only got one. That being said t, it happened to be a color that I really liked and use it quite often! No complaints here, I would purchase from here again.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my order. Thank you for everything.</li>
    <li> Poor quality.&lt;br /&gt;Chips very easy. Waste of $</li>
    <li> Not good !!! So hard to remove and the clot not good !!!</li>
    <li> Colors are very thick...pretty colors but polish very thick</li>
    <li> Thg product is alright. I got it for my birthday. Some colors for me were hideous, but many little were just beautiful! Some of the nail polishes toke a long time to dry and others in 2 minutes were dry! I got 5 duplicates! That was a little of amripp off!</li>
    <li> These polishes at first appeared to be well-packed, but two had dried polish on the outside of the bottle where a little had leaked out and dried, and one had leaked quite a bit, coating the packaging in polish.  Overall I am happy, but still it would have been nice to have no spills or leaks...</li>
    <li> All Very Beautiful Colors. I Only received One Duplicate. But whos to complain at THIS price. The NP remover pads honestly suck. But im okay with this. Highly Reccomended</li>
    <li> I have Mixed feelings about this brand of nail polish they have pretty colors and glitter nail polish but they do dry out and get thick little fast when you are using them or they sit out with the lid off but just soak them in some warm water and they will get thinned out</li>
    <li> All the bottles were well packaged, only one was broken and I was ok with that because it was one I didn&#x27;t really like. Price is amazing!!! The smell is strong but that doesn&#x27;t bother me too much. Delivery time was excellent, I received mine in three to four days!!!</li>
    <li> I was totally amazed at the colors..I got this for my teenage daughter for Christmas and she loves it. The price is very reasonable and the polish seems to be good quality.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from Amazon,  quality is really poor, it takes forever to dry and Peels very easily. It does not stay on the nails. Stay away from this BRAND. I called seller to return the entire set, but I was told that I be paying for return shipping (Cost $34, since its heavy). Seller wants to replace the defective pieces, but I want to return the entire set.&lt;br /&gt;No MONEY back neither from Amazon or the seller. Very Deceptive practices.</li>
    <li> This came with so many colors I was so surprised because the reviews were so mixed. Very good price, for so many polishes. The polish on the other hand only last about 2 days it comes off very quickly. Still a great gift for the nail polish fanatic.</li>
    <li> Awesome nail polish. Great colors. Shipped very fast. The only problem I had was one of the bottles was shattered. Not a big deal considering how cheap and great they are.</li>
    <li> If I could rate zero stars I would. Let me just start of by saying the colors are pretty especially the glitter ones. If you want polish that cracks, chips, peels etc in less than 24hrs this will be perfect for you. Besides the pretty colors, the only positive thing about this set is the 3 packs of nail polish remover pads. They are amazing and the moisturizer in the pads are great for your cuticles. Besides that....A HUGE WASTE OF MONEY</li>
    <li> This is such a good quality polish for the price and it lasts like a week on my nails...This is my favorite brand I definitely recommend this and I love the nail polish remover pads that comes with it, they work perfectly and leave my nails moistured without being greasy...I love it!</li>
    <li> My daughter loved the variety of  colors.  Not a one leaked and came carefully packaged. I would order this again!</li>
    <li> oh my gosh I love having so many nail polishes! no doubles at all! and sadly 2 broke in the mail but its ok I still love them all :)</li>
    <li> Perhaps discount does not mean better! This product was shipped to me with many of the bottles having leaked inside the boxes on the bottles. That&#x27;s not all. I have used the product and it does not stay on, in fact it peels off in a complete shape of the nail. There is either something wrong with the product as in it is expired on its shelf life or there is something wrong with it all the way around!&lt;br /&gt;I can NOT in good conscience recommend this product to anyone! Don&#x27;t buy it!!!  I wish I could return it and buy something that actually works.</li>
    <li> Used this as Christmas presents and everyone loved them !  Perfect for little gift sets and such amazing colors everyone got a glitter and plain color as well as an extra one</li>
    <li> This is an incredible value. The brand is Kleancolor and this particular collection offers a lot of the brand&#x27;s favorites. Several of the chunky holo colors are included, most of the metallics (I did not receive teal though but I was hardly sad about it with the other amazing polishes!) AND! Holo Chrome! Google a swatch of it, it is truly such a unique color.   I picked through the colors I wanted to keep and the colors that aren&#x27;t very *me* (I never wear greens or oranges for instance) I am packaging up for all the teenage girls in my family. I bought baskets at a dollar store and am filling one compartment with the polishes, another with a clipper/file set, and another with cotton rounds and a couple containers of the remover wipes that came with this set. Then I&#x27;m wrapping them with cellophane and ribbons. Such a great gift and it works out to around $5 a person!   The quality of the polishes is great, the color range is exquisite. What you see in the photo is exactly what I received. There are great vampy polishes, a cool modern gray, some fun neons, a few sheer or neutral colors, ballerina pinks, cool teals, metallics, glitters, scattered holographics, glitter shapes (stars and hearts) and just something for everyone. As far as I know there&#x27;s only one other website to buy this brand from than Amazon, and the prices are MUCH more than this.</li>
    <li> I ordered this set because I wanted some really cute glitter nail polishes, and for the price (coming out around $1 a bottle)this really couldn&#x27;t be beat. It came in about 4 days, super fast! All the bottles were individually wrapped and neatly stacked in the box. I didn&#x27;t receive any multiples of colors. Lots of glitters- holo&#x27;s, chunky, hearts, moons, and stars. There were also a couple marbles, pastels, and neons. The variety is really great, such an awesome set!</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE SELLER. CAUTION! AVOID! I purchased two completely different (advertised as completely different with no duplicates &amp; under two different names) 48 piece nail polish sets, and although I had no issue with broken bottles, after checking them all out I ended up with 49 doubles. So basically I received one whole duplicate set even though the seller&#x27;s sale page said that they would all be different. Why advertise two different sets if they are both exactly the same?! I contacted seller 3 times, simply and politely requesting that we work something out, ABSOLUTELY ZERO RESPONSE. This seller should not be allowed to do this. BEWARE! This seller is nothing but bad news. Only rated one star because I had to to post this review. One star is not even deserved. I am off to file an official complaint through Amazon right now. Think twice before buying from this seller, because if anything is wrong with your order you&#x27;ll never hear from them to resolve it.</li>
    <li> We got this for my daughters birthday.  When she opened it and saw what it was she yelled out \\&quot;Oh My Gosh!\\&quot;  The best part was all 48 polishes are wrapped in their own paper and she had to unwrap all of them.  So it was like she had 48 presents to open up.  She kept yelling out \\&quot;Oh My Gosh!\\&quot;  With the occasional \\&quot;This is going on forever!\\&quot;  Fantastic present for her!  We also ordered it late and asked them to make sure they shipped it quickly.  Not only did they do that but they kept us informed so that we knew it was on the way.  We are very happy with this order all the way around.</li>
    <li> My order came in today I just got my polish today they come broken on leak  im so happy and I love them color  I will be order from them again very happy customer happy yes</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but with the fast shipping of this product I cannot resist! The item shipped from California and I received it in CT in 2 days! A few polishes leaked slightly but its nothing a little remover cant take care of! Not one color is the same! Some reviews complain about the smell but it smells like every other nail polish. It was a bit strong when I opened the box because a few leaked but once it was all cleaned up it was fine! No broken bottles either. Would definitely buy again and I have already recomended it to friends and family!</li>
    <li> this is the worst nail polish I have ever owned. even if I put a high quality top coat over this nail polish it never lasts beyond two days without chipping. its a shame too because they are such pretty colors. all these reviews were posted after people opened the package. NONE are after trying the polishes out and finding they are cheap and poor quality. Atleast five of the polishes were damaged during shipping. I would NOT recommend these to anyone</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a friend of mine who is opening her new Glam business. The shipping was extremely fast, but the size of the products is what is very deceiving. I did not expect the nail polish bottles to be a small as they were...They are not like your regular shaped nail polish bottle. In this case, I find the product overpriced!!!! As far as the quality, I am not sure, my friend has yet to try it.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this set.  The first one was a gift and it was a huge hit so I had to order it for myself!  I love that you can get away with just one coat of polish or make sure your color is vibrant at two coats.  I&#x27;m a two-coater anyways, having bought every previous bottle of nail polish from my local stores.  I am also a bargain hunter, so the price is right for me!  My nails are a fabulous new color daily and that makes me a happy girl!  I&#x27;ve been doing water marble nail art since I&#x27;ve got these and they work perfectly in case someone is wondering about that.  Just make sure you have a good base coat on before you dip.  Have fun with these ladies, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the nail polish remover pads are excellent!  A great bonus!</li>
    <li> Wow. Wow. Wow! I loved these nail polishes.. i got them today and i ordered on thursday.. im so happy with how they look. Pigments are beautiful. Its not too watery nor heavy. Its just right. And they dry quickly. I didnt get ny scented nail polish remover. Which is why i put 4 stars. It was packaged nicley. I love them :D</li>
    <li> This nail polish chips VERY quickly. Pretty colors, and decent application, but it doesn&#x27;t really matter too much what clear top coat you use... I couldn&#x27;t find one that would keep it from chipping after 1-3 days.</li>
    <li> I received this yesterday and overall, I&#x27;m very pleased.  I received a great selection of colors.  Unlike several of the reviews mentioned, they are full size bottles and I didn&#x27;t receive too many glitters, (Just a couple of holos, no chunky glitters with shapes or anything like that).  The nail polish remover pads are pretty useless.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to open my package when it arrived!!!  There are a few reasons why I rated this item three stars instead of four but will discuss that below...first the Pros!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  There are some AMAZING colors in this set, I immediately fell in love with one in particular and it was the Cobalt blue, it is a dark blue but such an wonderful color and I have been on the hunt for a nice Cobalt blue for some time. There are gorgeous pearl polishes in this set as well that I love. The polish goes on smoothly and I found the brushes to be of nice quality as well. I immediately removed my current polish and started playing and swatching my new colors and overall I would have to say that I really like majority in the set with only a few regular colors I don&#x27;t see myself getting a ton of use out of which I consider to be a success when purchasing a lot of polishes like this. I didn&#x27;t receive any repeats in the set. While the nail polish removers where dry (see note in cons) I did use them with just regular nail polish remover like I would a cotton round or cotton ball. While the scent didn&#x27;t come through as I was using regular nail polish remover they did leave behind a nice mosturizing oil on my nails that I massaged into my nails and cuticles (I did make sure to wash my hands well prior to applying polish again because of the oil residue).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  I was REALLY worried that I was going to find nail polishes broken upon opening the box and seeing how they were packed. Each polish was wrapped in some thin brown paper and just stacked upon one another with brown paper at the bottoms and top of the box but no bubble wrap. Additionally the box was not marked as fragile in any way. Luckily I found that none of my polishes were broken but could see with this inadequate packing how they easily could have been. I recently purchased another nail polish lot and in that packing they where packed in individual boxes within the shipping box and each little box was wrapped in bubble wrap additionally the box had fragile and glass written ALL OVER the shipping box, that type of packing care would have been nice. The smell of these polishes are ummm...let&#x27;s say unique. Of course as us girls know all polishes have a strong smell but it seems that these have a much stronger odor than other brands. I normally paint my nails in my bedroom without any problems but when I was playing around with these polishes I had to go outside as both my husband and I quickly had terrible headaches from the odor, something to consider is you are sensitive to smells. This may not be a con for all but I am not a big glitter nail polish user and while the description did say it included glitter polishes I didn&#x27;t realize that was going to mean a lot of them. To be honest I didn&#x27;t count precisely the number of glitter polishes but I would estimate that 12-15 of the bottles were glitter polishes, like I said if you like glitter polishes this is perfect for you and I will wear some or use as top coats for some glitz but I generally don&#x27;t wear just glitter polishes. Another thing that bothered me...and this easily might just be my OCD personality :-) is that each bottle has a large label on the handle with the color as well as a circle color sticker on the bottom. Again I am being picky here but felt that it made the polishes look cheap. I attempted to remove the labels but they are the type of labels that don&#x27;t remove easily and would have left sticky residue on the handle so I let them be. Like I said a very minor detail but something that bothered me. The nail polishes removers were completely dry. I recieved these same nail polish removers in the other lot of polishes I mentioned and they were completely dry as well, they come in a flimsy container that I don&#x27;t see how it could possibly hold liquid (see note in pros about what I did like about the nail polish removers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with my purchase. It is a large lot of polishes ata very minimal price even for drugstore polishes. So if you are looking to expand your collection quickly, easily, inexpensively, and don&#x27;t mind not hand picking every color this is a great way to go and would recommend. Happy nail polishing!!!</li>
    <li> I am so happy with all the nail polish I got!!! I can change my colors like every day and I have somehting to go with every outfit in my closet!</li>
    <li> I normally hate writing reviews on products but with this I just felt that I had to because of how happy I am with this product! Initially I was very hesitant to buy this, but I ordered from MissPinkCat and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the condition this was received in! I live in Ohio and this was being shipped all the way from Cali so I was definitely expecting broken ones, but I was happily surprised! None were broken, leaking, chipped or otherwise damaged and all of the bottles were accounted for! There are so many different colors included, some neons, metallics, classics, glitters, classics, and a couple chunky holos! I couldnt be more happy with this purchase! I would definitely buy from this seller again:)</li>
    <li> Great value for the number of bottles - we had one bottle without a brush...but in the big picture of things...oh well :)</li>
    <li> I was impressed with how fast my box of polish arrived, but even more impressive was the fact that not one bottle was broken or damaged. There were no loose caps or leaks. Each bottle was individually bubble wrapped and placed in its own little box inside the bigger box. I didn&#x27;t have a single duplicate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  1. Bottle size is approximately 0.5 fl. Oz.&lt;br /&gt;  2. The colors are beautiful and unique; with an outstanding range of solids&lt;br /&gt;  and glitters.&lt;br /&gt;  3. Several bottles of chunky glitter in a variety of colors and shapes&lt;br /&gt;  (including hearts).&lt;br /&gt;  4. Several bottles of fine glitter in a variety of colors.&lt;br /&gt;  5. A few single coat polishes, but the majority requires two coats.&lt;br /&gt;  6. Most of the colors are fast drying.&lt;br /&gt;  7. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with chipping (though I always wear a top-coat).&lt;br /&gt;  8. Perfect for nail art designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  1. The scented nail polish remover that came with the polish is nice for an&lt;br /&gt;  oil-based cuticle treatment, but not for removing polish.&lt;br /&gt;  2. I have never used a nail polish that stinks like this brand. Thankfully,&lt;br /&gt;  the smell dissipates in less than an hour--otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;  3. The bushes are really low-quality. While they are usable, they make&lt;br /&gt;  applying the nail polish difficult, so I just use a different brush.</li>
    <li> I just received my package today via USPS and I was SO excited to open it.  My excitement was validated when I opened the package, and then each individual box, and saw all of the b-e-a-Utiful colors.  I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better assortment.  Glitters, pearls, metallics, creams, neons and chunkies. I did not receive the remover pads that were advertised but I couldn&#x27;t care less. I ordered this for the polish so I&#x27;m happy with what I got.  Two of the bottles had a little leakage, but it was dry right on the outside of the affected bottle only, no biggie.  I&#x27;ll put up some pix with the names so everyone can oogle them :P  What a GREAT deal and it arrived a few days early too! (CA - NJ in less than a week) I wasn&#x27;t expecting it until Tuesday really.  Definitely well worth it :)</li>
    <li> Great deal for a fun set.  Some of the brushes aren&#x27;t perfect, but for the price the colors and quality are great.</li>
    <li> All the nail polishes came beautifully packaged, and all were intact! Not a single duplicate and all the nail polishes look amazing! I can&#x27;t wait to start playing with the different colors and glitter polishes!</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the polish i recieved.&lt;br /&gt;I received a matt finish, a few scented....glitter....pretty pretty colors.&lt;br /&gt;For this price, I think its one heck of a buy.&lt;br /&gt;I am wearing a color today that came in the set.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone loves it! Some of the colors are new to me, and i cant wait to wear them!&lt;br /&gt;I would and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Decent price, and beautiful colors! none of my nailpolishes were cracked, or spilled, every color was different and it came way earlier than i expected. I dont know why people complain about the smell, its nailpolish, its supposed to smell. I recommend this set, considering im glitter crazy. I JUST LOVE THE COLORS!</li>
    <li> I received broken polish and I contacted the seller but never received a response.  The polish was wrapped with 1 piece of bubble wrap and each polish in fish net wrap. I guess they weren&#x27;t expecting the polish to come in contact with the others since they were all in one small box (duh).</li>
    <li> This product is definitely worth the money.  Awesome colors.  2 coats is all you need.  Product ships in 3-4 days.  I received everything nothing damaged each polish was individually wrapped.  Vendor sent guarantee if anything missing/broken they will replace it.  Product exceeded my expectations :0) Variety of different and unique colors.</li>
    <li> OMG....LOVED THIS!!!!!So happy all of my nail polishes arrived intact.Didnt receive any broken bottles or repeated colors. ALTHOUGH the polish does take forever to dry, that problem is easily fixed with a good top coat!SO many nail color possibilities!&amp;lt;3</li>
    <li> These polishes are great.  Packaging was fine with no damage during shipping.  There was a wonderful variety of colors with no duplicates.  The coverage is great with most not even needing a second coat.  When I contacted the seller they responded within 24 hours.  Very satisfied and would purchase again!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 16th birthday and I love it! None of the nail polishes were cracked and were individually wrapped. The nail polish is like store bought and looks good on. There were no repeats and good variety. The nail polish remover works okay.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the packaging! I was expecting 1-2 polishes to be broken based on what others said. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the nessesary measures were taken to ensure none of the polishes were damaged during shipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;I like to ge the bad news out of the way first so here it is: the polish remover pads smell good and although it says on the container that one pad will remove polish from ten nails, I ended up using 2 pads on one nail before I gave up and took out my normal bottle of remover and some cotton balls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polish also has a strong smell. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily \\&quot;stink\\&quot; but it is an extremely strong polish smell. If you are sensitive to scents, this would easily give you a headache. The smell did not bother me though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;The colors, OMG THE COLORS! I got just he write amount og glitters and  variety of colors I would actually wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polish dries quickly but the chunky polish takes a while. I would say maybe 30-40 minutes. I did not use a fan so I assume tHe drying time would be faster if I made an attempt at something other than air drying while I watched TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to a friend. I have two girls I babysit that love polish and I thought about getting hem some colors but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this only because of the strong smell. I am not sure if it is harmful but for my 8 and 5 year old girls, I would not take he chance.</li>
    <li> The package arrived earlier than expected, in about 4 days. The bottles were placed together in boxes of six. None of the polishes were cracked or broken. Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I was so satisfied with this purchase! Each nail polish was less than a dollar! It came in so many different colors! I think this will make a great gift for my sister!</li>
    <li> My order arrived quickly and so far I am very pleased. The colors are just beautiful! I think that my 16 year old will just love this assortment of colors. I also purchased the nail stand from Amazon for her nail colors to go on. I can&#x27;t wait to see my daughters face!</li>
    <li> Worst polish ever! Takes forever and 7 years to dry...no joke! I didn&#x27;t want to listen to the reviews about the smell and it taking forever to dry, but it does. If you want to be high on polish fumes, stuck doing nothing because you can&#x27;t use your hand for fear of smudging or denting your manicure, then buy this polish. It is sitting in my house taking up space because I can&#x27;t bring myself to throw away $50.00 worth of polish away. Worst purchase I have ever made.</li>
    <li> Though my first shipment was lost and it had to be reshipped, I still received my product before I needed it. They arrived individually wrapped and none were broken. The colors are vibrant and most go on with a single coat!! There are a lot of glitters in this set. For those that don&#x27;t want the glitters this may not be the set for you because it works out to be about 50/50. I paint nails and do nail art almost daily and I am very pleased and will order again!</li>
    <li> Best $37 I&#x27;ve spent in a while! The colors are so pretty &amp; product came in a weeks time! The product was packaged very well, each bottle individually wrapped to ensure they do not break. I am very satisfied! :) &amp; would def. recommend!</li>
    <li> It was estimated that I receive my order between August 1 - August 15, and I received it today July 21, so I&#x27;m VERY happy about that! Even though I painted my nails yesterday thinking it wouldn&#x27;t be here until next week! lol Anyway, it was packaged very well, in an appropriate sized box, with bubble wrap and every nail polish bottle was covered in a plastic netting. There weren&#x27;t any broken bottles, so that was VERY nice!! I received 48 bottles and 5 nail files as advertised. Each nail file was different, so that is fun! All of the nail polish is different, so no duplicates, and the nail polish it&#x27;s self is as it should be. My only complaint about this purchase, is that I wrote the seller BEFORE purchasing this order, and I never got a response. I&#x27;m glad that I don&#x27;t need to contact them right now because I have the feeling that they still wouldn&#x27;t respond to me. I just read a review that says they purchased this order, and another one with different colors under a different name, and I just did the same thing. They claim that it&#x27;s the same seller and the received the exact same colors even though both sales are advertised differently. I REALLY hope this is not the case, and I will be sure to come back and update my review when I receive my second order, which states it should be here between August 2 - August 16, so we&#x27;ll see! I hope that is not the case and that I actually get another 48 bottles that are different! Other than that stuff, the actual product IS as advertised! :-)&lt;br /&gt;(http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005EMSGDW/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o01_s00_i00)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: July 31, 2012 -  I just realized that the products that I received are NOT the products shown or advertized in this sale from this seller name. Instead the products that I received were the \\&quot;Rainbow\\&quot; colors advertized in the other sale that I bought by a different user name. There also was NOT an invoice in my box. I&#x27;m afraid that the two sales I bought ARE From the same user, even though they are not advertized as being so. I took pictures and put them up for everyone to see on this sale. I will update again when I receive my other order that SHOULD have been the \\&quot;Rainbow\\&quot; colors, but better be the \\&quot;Trendy\\&quot; colors instead since I already have the rainbow colors now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: August 2, 2012 - My second package of nail polish just showed up, and while the packaging and return label where different, I believe that these two sales ARE in fact the same person. Now that I&#x27;ve looked at the sales again, this sellers name is now on BOTH sales, and they didn&#x27;t have the same name when I purchased these two orders. (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005H8PTR4/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o00_s00_i00)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, the packaging of this box SUCKED! I liked the blue netting better, and it also protected the bottles better. This second box had one broken bottle, and that is better than more, but one broken bottle is still not good when I&#x27;ve paid for that bottle. This set should have been the \\&quot;Trendy\\&quot; nail set sold by this seller, but was instead labeled with the other sellers name and address.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Contacted the seller after this review, and they responded within two hours and said they would send a replacement. I will update again when I receive it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now getting down to the colors. Out of 96 bottles, I had 1 broken bottle, and 15 color doubles. I had expected two completely different sets of colors, just like most of the other buyers for these products, and for the most part, that is what I got. There are pros and cons to this fact, pros: the polish is great and the colors are nice; Cons: there are 15 bottles that are the same, for a total of 30 bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, the doubles aren&#x27;t that bad. The colors are pretty, the polish works great, and most of us like to have doubles of our favorite color anyway! So you just might end up with some new favorite colors! As for me, I&#x27;m going to send some of the doubles to my sister and my mom, and give a couple to my daughter.nd my mom, and give a couple to my daughter.</li>
    <li> I actually opened these and set them out in our heated garage to air out for a week before wrapping them as a Christmas present.  I haven&#x27;t opened them all up, so I am not sure if one has broke, but the smell was terribly strong. From what I can see the colors look vibrant and the pricing was reasonable for 48 pieces so I am happy.  I hope the person I bought them for can get past the smell!</li>
    <li> I strongly suggest that if you love nail polish this is the product for you, there are so many choices to wear and show off to your friends my absolute favorite is the gold colured polish.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE. I was skeptical about what would arrive but, I am glad I made the purchase. The color variety is amazing and the quality of the paint is good too.</li>
    <li> Ordered these for my 15 year old daughter for Christmas. She loves them. Not salon quality, but if one changes colors as much as my daughter, that really doesn&#x27;t matter:-).</li>
    <li> My wife loves the variety of choices and the durability of it, and she wears a new color every day</li>
    <li> First off, this is my first product review, so, sorry if it gets lengthy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so, my boyfriend ordered me this set as a belated Christmas gift after i&#x27;d talked about most of my nail polishes being used up or dried up . And he was kind of worried about how it would show up due to many of the reviews on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I got it and in all honestly, I really dont have anything really bad to say about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS.&lt;br /&gt;1. ARRIVAL -  He ordered it 01/01/13, and was estimated to arrive the 7th.  And despite so many reviews saying it was extrememely late arriving,&lt;br /&gt;I got the dreaded \\&quot;sorry we missed you\\&quot; note on the 7th, but I didn&#x27;t get around to picking it up until today (01/11/13)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. SELECTION - I love the selection! Nice neons, pretty pastels, funcky metallics, and glitters! I got 12 glitters, some people said they had a ton. But most of mine nice colors and not too huge meaning they will actually get used. Some are neat shapes (stars, cresant moons, and hearts). I know having glitters at all was a CON for a lot of people, but the amount I got coupled with the colors they were, i&#x27;m satisfied. (especially a glitter polish called Chunky Holo Bluebell, it&#x27;s rather neat because when the light hits it its all rainbow-y and looks great over a lot of colors (google it!). I usually put glitters over black or white polish.&lt;br /&gt;(EDIT: I&#x27;d like to mention I didn&#x27;t have any duplicate colors!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. PACKAGING - I saw some of the pictures reviewers posted, and some had brown paper wrapped around each bottle, some had this blue netting stuff, And some had KleanColor white boxes, 6 polishes per box. That&#x27;s what mine was packaged in and though some of the lower boxes in the package were slightly damaged, I had no broken bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. NAIL POLISH REMOVERS - The reviews about the nail polish removers kind of surprised me at how negative they were because these really aren&#x27;t THAT bad. I popped them open to smell them and they actually smell really good. Particularly the cherry one. Of course they don&#x27;t work amazingly, but they DO work (and hey, they were free). It takes 1 pad per nail though rather than \\&quot;1 pad will clean all 10 nails\\&quot; as it states on the container, so many of you would probably find it easier to do what another reviewer did and use the pads like you would a cotton ball and just put your own nail polish remover on it. Also I did NOT experience \\&quot;white streaks\\&quot; on my nails after using it. I&#x27;d give the nail polish removers a 3.75/5 overall!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS.&lt;br /&gt;1. NAIL POLISH REMOVER - I like them, don&#x27;t get me wrong, and I&#x27;m appreciate they came with the set because I will certainly be using them again, but as some reviewers mentioned, you will likely want to wash your hands after removing the polish with these. They kind of make your fingers feel dirty. Another reviewer described it as \\&quot;filmy\\&quot;, i would agree. Not too much of a turn off for me though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. No white, gold, or silver.  Silver is my favorite polish to wear, and white is great as well expecially if you are like me and like a white base with colored tips. Gold is also a pretty color to use. Unfortunately none were present. Neither was the the Holo Chrome color others mentioned, so that was kind of a disappointment. But not enough of one to lose a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, everyone seems to hate the color Fashionista. My first reaction was \\&quot;Who came up with this god-awful color\\&quot; BUT when I was trying out the colors and experimenting with them earlier, I found out that with enough coats (I tend to always use 3-4 coats and a clear top coat every time I paint my nails), it becomes a decent dark brown. Not sure who wants to paint their nails brown of all colors, but yeah, if you happen to need a brown, that&#x27;s the color to use, because the color actually called \\&quot;Brown\\&quot; is most certainly not brown. It&#x27;s more of a burnt orange, or how \\&quot;red\\&quot; clay looks. Nice earthy color, but not brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I AM areal customer! I DID receieve this product, and I DO love it!&lt;br /&gt;I know a lot of companies put up false positive reviews to make them look good, but that&#x27;s certainly not the case with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely would recommend this set to friends/family.real customer! I DID receieve this product, and I DO love it!&lt;br /&gt;I know a lot of companies put up false positive reviews to make them look good, but that&#x27;s certainly not the case with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely would recommend this set to friends/family.</li>
    <li> Brought this for xmas present. The kids now want to give it to their step mum. My daughter was so impressed with all the colours that she can&#x27;t wait to help use them. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love the collection of colors. Perfect for someone who is just getting their collection started or if your looking for a wide range of colors. Some really pretty/different shades. Only bad thing I found was one or two of them was a little thick for a new polish and the brush is a little thicker than I like. But over all a great buy. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This was amazing when I got it!! all these different colors and they were the regular size bottles you get from the store.. not the little tiny ones... also its just like regular polish it doesn&#x27;t come right off when you wash the dishes or do laundry... can&#x27;t wait to have my daughters spa party with all these fun colors!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter asked for this nail set for Christmas and I obliged. There were several duplicate colors, but my daughter doesn&#x27;t mind. The problem that she has with this polish is that it chips very easily. They don&#x27;t even last a day of easy use. Even with a high quality top coat the polish breaks off of the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good side to these is that they are great for experimenting and practicing. What&#x27;s more, there are a lot of fun colors to work with. If you&#x27;re looking for polish for a kid, these will do fine -- although they stink very badly -- if you want polish to wear to work or out and about, beware, these won&#x27;t last for the day.</li>
    <li> The packaging was great!! They all came in a cardboard box, each individually wrapped in a blue net like wrapping along with bubble wrap on the bottom and top of the box. Only one problem. My barbie pink polish leaked out of its bottle. But other than that, everything else was perfect. I also received the 3 scented nail polish removers just like in the title.I would like to buy this again, but if only they had options of choosing different colors and not a repeats of them for the next buy considering Kleancolors has 200+ colors.</li>
    <li> Really enjoyed opening this package of all these nail polishes. Going to host a girls night on Friday and we will be using all of these &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Wife loves it. She couldn&#x27;t believe all the different 1 off colors there are.  And she also loved all the colors with the glitters that had different shapes to them.  Definitely one of the best kits she said she has seen.  She will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!! enough said by great colors for a great price so you can get the bang for your buck i just love it !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> So just received this in the mail today and love it!! The polishes were all packed very nice no duplicates nothing broken. I&#x27;m am very happy will purchase from them again. Maybe the metallic set didn&#x27;t get all the metallics I wanted. Great buy!!</li>
    <li> Thank you so much, this is so affordable! and the varieties of colors and glitters, i jes love everyhting about it. The reason why i gave this 4 stars is because the box of polishes were smashed, other than that all the 48 pieces were great. Thank you!</li>
    <li> The color chips awary.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my self and loved all the colors :) I got quite a bit of purples but all and all got a good variety. I did receive 2 hardeners and emailed them and they sent a new color in place of...deff would recommend!</li>
    <li> I just got these a few days ago and I love them. No duplicate colors, packaging was great, nothing cracked or broken. The colors are gorgeous, I can&#x27;t decide which ones to use first</li>
    <li> OMG ! This is the best nail polish starter kit. It has BEAUTIFUL colors that match everything in my closet. It has some glitter nail polishes to match the solid color polish, the polish remover smells great ! The packaging was awesome and nothing was broken. I am so happy with this purchase I am getting another one for my mom as a Christmas gift. And before I forget, the pigmentation on these bad boys are AWESOME with or without a top coat. Highly pleased and satisfied :)</li>
    <li> Ordered for my daughter in law and she loves them! These were a great purchase at a great price, and shipping! I&#x27;ll definitely order again , thank you ,</li>
    <li> Nice colors.  Polish seems to be good quality but the batch I got had about 10 pairs of duplicate colors.</li>
    <li> The colours are great and really pleased BUT they chip really quick n easy ie within a day.  I put some on at night,  went to bed, got up and 2 were chipped within an hour.</li>
    <li> I loved the fact that a lot of them were bright colors, i just wish there was more variety of bright colors &amp; or shades, and a few of the glitter [I personally don&#x27;t really use it]. Each set came very well wrapped, and it came in great condition.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS A BIRTHDAY GIFT AND IT SEEMS THE WHOLE NEIGHBOR HOOD GETS THEIR NAILS AND TOE NAILS DONE WITH THE COLOR OF THEIR CHOICE</li>
    <li> Summer is here and that means its time for rainbow colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw the colors I was confuse which to use first and liked all of them, but then decided to try the silver glittery shade.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say it looks elegant and so easy to apply and the most vital thing is that it drys fast. It takes not time to dry apply it any time before you go out, and you are ready to go and enjoy bright marvelous polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I did not like is that the price, its way too pricey for shades that will stay short time, the color will be perfect if you want your nail polishes for two days. But if you wanted it for longer time, it is not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that these are summer colors and sure you will like it but if the price is less, the product will be perfect thing.</li>
    <li> My daughter love the colors and they go on pretty well, Downfall is that I sent an email to the seller. 46/48 of the bottles were broken/damaged. I paid $51.00 for a  set of 48 bottles but end up and get 46. I asked for replacement of the two colors and they didn&#x27;t get back with me if they will give me a replacement or not. I hope your bottles do not broken when they are delivered because the seller never response. I had to file a claim and I see what will happen from there. This is the reason why I gave it a one star due to lack of communication of the seller.</li>
    <li> There is a great assortment of colors, only one set of doubles. I&#x27;m a very picky person when it comes to my nails and about the only thing that bothered me was that there were quite a few glitter polishes, in lots of colors and fun shapes and sizes, but glitter none-the-less. At first, i was upset because I was looking for more solid colors. Then i realized that out of all of my polishes (including this purchase, i have well over 100) I didn&#x27;t have ANY glitter ones....It was at that point that i realized how fortunate i was. Nail polish is pretty expensive, and i never thought to purchase glitter ones, but now that I have them, i absolutely love them!!! There are about 8 glitter polishes in total...and the rest are solids, but beautiful hues that you just don&#x27;t see everywhere! At approximately a dollar a bottle, it is definitely worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> i ordered the kleancolors on a sat and received them  week and half later.....at first iwasent going to order them bc the cheap price  normally when finger nail polish is cheaP they tend to get sticky and thick...but not these their true to color they have some wonderful colors....i was so excited i paonted my nails every other day...wonderful colors</li>
    <li> this is an awesome set and was packaged very well. there are a few colors that are only a few shades different than others but still an awesome set.. makes a good gift for teenagers</li>
    <li> I got this for Christmas for my daughter. she is very much into doing other peoples nails. Anyway, she loves the set. The only bad thing I will say it one of them opened in shipping but for as many as come in the set it was amazing that only one opened.</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re gorgeous colors</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister in-law who is a few years younger than me. The colors look great, she hasn&#x27;t used them yet but I hope she likes them!</li>
    <li> The quality was alright and i loved the packaging. Most of the nail polishes were glitter but my favorites are the solids and some shimmer ones as well.  My order came in about 6 business days. I would really recommend these to everyone. I can&#x27;t wait to try them all!</li>
    <li> Polishes were Kleancolor brand. Polish came in boxed packaging as seen in photos. No cracks. There was no opaque finisher. Sent a nail hardener instead. I think she picks random polishes to send. Great variety. A few duplicate looking polishes but all were technically a different style number. Some polish was a bit thick but polish thinner easily fixed that problem. Over all it was very nice for the price.</li>
    <li> I love these nail polishes, shipping time was great, colors are beautiful and there is a good varity , I didnt have not even 1 color that was doubled or broke. I am beyond happy with this purchase, it is a must have!!  OH and nail polish removers work great!  AGAIN EVERYTHING WAS AS PROMISED. LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> only one repeated color, they are fantastic, the glitter ones generally take a couple of coats but that is usually expected, Amazing assortment</li>
    <li> I CANNOT EVEN GET MORE THAN 2 DAYS (AND THATS A STRETCH) WEAR OF THIS POLISH WITHOUT IT CHIPPING. POOR QUALITY.</li>
    <li> I received my product right on time ! All the bottles were in great condition except for one . I only had one broken brush which was the &amp;#34;Neon Lime&amp;#34; by Kleancolor . I had two duplicate polishes which were the &amp;#34; Pearl Beige&amp;#34; by Kleancolor . All of my other colors were awesome . I&#x27;m ready to use them !</li>
    <li> Ordered this nail polish set December 06 2013 for a Christmas present. It&#x27;s now December 26 after many emails to resolve this issue still no response or order. Beware!!!! 48+ dollars down the drain  1 star rating because you can&#x27;t do zero stars</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved this. Great colors, no double colors.</li>
    <li> Just got my nail polishes today!:) Only took about 4 business days. I love these nail polishes! All of them are beautiful! Plenty of glitter, shimmer, neon, and solid colors! The only thing I&#x27;m a little sad about is that I don&#x27;t think I got the Halo polish people were writing about :( Other than that I would totally buy this again! The smell was like any other nail polish, the quality appears to be good from what I&#x27;ve tested. It also works great for water marbling! :) It would have cost a lot more to build a collection like this from buying in the store! Overall I am very pleased with this set. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I purchased this set for my wife and will give it to her once I have built an appropriate rack/holder shelf system for display purposes that can allow easy access and display all of the vibrant colors, until then the quality of the product itself s yet to be seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the moment I simply wanted to set out that when I looked at some of the reviews I was most concerned about the shipping quality and broken bottles. I saw some of the photos of paper wrapped bottles broken, as I&#x27;m sure you will also. I really wanted to get the seller who uses the plastic netting and pays proper attention to the details of packing. Upon some digging and contacting I found \\&quot;Miss Pink Cat\\&quot; is the seller who ships in this method. I ordered from that seller, and the boxed arrived wonderfully packed with no broken bottles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course everyone may experience different results, but my 2 cents is this was a great seller, prompt and properly packaged! I will update on the quality of the product after I build the display stand and give the set to my wife.</li>
    <li> Okay let me just first say i love nail polish and i bought this set because of the great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered from Miss Pink Cat and her price was a bit more on the pricier side of the six sellers but the set is still a great deal. All 48 bottles were there with just a few cracks from the shipping. I did not receive any regular holos (all the other reviews said they did) although, i did receive two chunky holos (dont care to much for them they are VERY sheer).. Well, i thought i should email the seller about the lack of holos more than a week ago and i still have not received an answer. i thought that buyers should be warned: dont expect the greatest colors from this set. the size of the bottles are OK but kinda tiny. not mini. but thats the brand. but really, if you really want the good glitters and holos, you might want to think about ordering elsewhere. I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> these colors are absolutely beautiful. if you like glitter polish then this is for you. not all but most of the colors have glitter flakes in them and there are a handful of just glitter polishes. I didn&#x27;t find a single color that I didn&#x27;t like. A couple of the bottles had dry polish on them but nothing was leaking or broken. I will definitely be buying the other set like this pack</li>
    <li> The nail polish is dull when it dries, and smells really bad. Not like a normal nail polish smell. Maybe I&#x27;m just disappointed cause my expectations were very high. I like the nail polish and would not return it the colors are pretty it&#x27;s just they&#x27;re not very good quality. They should get less glitter nail polish more solid colors</li>
    <li> I received this right away and in tact! Have not used yet but it is exactly what I wanted for my daughter. Cannot wait for her to open and use. Great deal on this! No repeat colors. I will add French manicure colors, has everything else though.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these! Great Christmas gifts for my girls! Both sets matched and had no single colors, which is perfect for us...no arguments! :D I greatly recomend this product!</li>
    <li> I cannot be more pleased with this purchase.  It was packed nicely and the colors are outstanding - I am beside myself at how nice this polish is for the price.. I purchased this for my 13 year old step daughter and I am positive that I will be winning some step mother awards for this.  It must go down in history!!!</li>
    <li> I got this set for my 18 year old daughter for Christmas.  All the colors arrived in excellent condition (6 polishes were placed inside a small box which was placed inside a bigger box.  There were 8 small boxes..plenty of padding and extra packing was used to prevent breakage).  The colors are fabulous (really vibrant) and there is a lot of variety too...glitters, metallic, mattes, etc.  She also got three containers of nail polish remover pads.  The polishes are 15ml (or .50 oz).  She has to put on double coats to get the coverage she likes but she is very pleased with the product...it made her Christmas!</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors, great price. My only problem is the polish only lasts about two days without chipping with base and top coats. I also got a few duplicates. Came well packed. I would recommend this set for younger or young at heart ladies just because the colors aren&#x27;t very professional in my opinion. My daughter and I love them.</li>
    <li> What a deal this is. All the colors are very nice and stay on very well. They have very good coverage. Some polishes were spilled but just a tiny bit, not a big deal.  Very impressed.</li>
    <li> Amazing colors and no duplicates.  Arrived all in one piece and very quickly.  Would definitely recommend.  Haven&#x27;t used the polish yet as xmas gift but very happy with what I see so far.</li>
    <li> All the colors were perfect! Arrived way earlier than the estimated arrival! No broken polishes and there was only one that I didn&#x27;t like! Very good deal!</li>
    <li> They are perfect in every way! They are all very pretty colors, they dont smell to bad. and they paint on the nail very nicely!</li>
    <li> I decided rather than spend a ton of money getting my nails done I would start doing them myself and thought this would be a great way to start.  I received my order quickly and was not at all disappointed.  I received chunky glitters, neon, pastel, glitter, and your more traditional colors.  I also received a nail hardener along with black, white, gold and silver.  The colors go on nicely and are really pretty.  I do have issues with the polish chipping in some cases after only a day but I have that issue with any polish I use.  I would love it if they came out with another set of 48 colors.</li>
    <li> It was a perfect birthday gift for my wife, she likes different colors, especially the glitter kind. She used to buy the Dollar Store kind, but these are a lot better.</li>
    <li> What I expected...lovely colors...quality polish...all polishes were all intact ...I would def recommend these polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scented polish removers were cute...</li>
    <li> I GOT THESE NAIL POLISHES WITHIN 4 BUSINESS DAYS, AND NONE OF THE BOTTLES WERE BROKEN, THEY ALL CAME IN INDIVIDUAL BUBBLE PLASTIC BAGS, AND IN BOXES, EVERY COLOR IS DIFFERENT, I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT, THE PRICE IS VERY SURPRISING, AND IT&#x27;S TOTALLY WORTH IT :)</li>
    <li> I love all of the colors, they didn&#x27;t spill out. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a five is because I haven&#x27;t tried them. I just received them today, the shipment came in very fast ☺</li>
    <li> I bought this kit to use for gifts and was impressed with the quality and the variety.  The colors are vibrant and hugely varied, just perfect for the huge variety of taste in color between the 25 girls we shared it with.  There were only a couple of colors that they were unahappy with--</li>
    <li> Excellent product would recommend to others, but I received it, I was robbed by the company that transported. Advised not to use Aeropost (Aerocasillas) play with your products.</li>
    <li> They are true to their word that you have 48 nail polishes, however, some are so close to the same color that I could have sworn that they were duplicates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the packaging could have been better but I cannot complain too much because there were no broken ones. Okay of a deal but I most likely wouldn&#x27;t order this product again.</li>
    <li> Best deal on nail polish in the world.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who loves nail polish...the colors are wonderful, I got no repeats! All were different. The quality of the nail polishes is very good. I also got a nail hardener, which is an unexpected but pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was faster than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and the seller.</li>
    <li> Our daughter was completely surprised by this and loves it!  Awesome!  Beautifully packaged and in great condition when it arrived!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> They are great polishes, I really like them they were packed EXTREMELY well, but there was one leaky bottle.  The one thing that really bugs me about the polishes is that they take FOREVER to dry (two hours later and they were still tacky.) The leaky bottle was neon yellow and my only yellowy shade. :(  But overall I really like this product!</li>
    <li> beautiful colors only 1 like color and im just  very happy with the delivery time was awsome im just sad that i havent got to use them yet because i have been admitted to the hopital but i just cant wait to get home and enjoy them :)</li>
    <li> great variety of colors and all the shimmer and glitter you could ever hope for.  Polish goes on easily and dries quick quickly considering its thicker consistency.  It likely could be used for stamping although I have not tried that yet.  great value for the small price.</li>
    <li> These came 3days before the earliest ship date, I ordered these 4 days ago...that is incredible. They came in perfect condition, no leaks or breaks at all. I did not get one repeat color, lots of glitter polishes (true to the title). The colors are very pigmented, one coat and thats all you need! This is an awesome bargain even cheap polish that is no where near this kind of quality isn&#x27;t this easy on the wallet. I will be ordering more colors and misspinkcat will be who I order from.</li>
    <li> When I received the nail polishes I was beyond excited. I love the colors so much! There were a few mix ups but they were resolved and everything turned out well in the end. (:</li>
    <li> i gave this to my little sister as a Christmas present and she loves it so she happy im happy</li>
    <li> The bottles came in nicely packaged with no broken bottles.  The colors are fantastic.  Trendy, and pretty with no repeats.  My set even included a few of the new matte colors which I had been eager to try.  I am a long time devotee to OPI products and while the KleanKolor will not replace OPI they are a suitable polish for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color went on nicely and two coats covered well.  I was very concerned about the wear as that is usually my biggest challenge with polish.  I was pleasantly surprised.  They stayed chip free through doing laundry, taking a shower, and a night of partying.  Now keep in mind I am diligent about my prep and finish steps.  I always use a bonder, base coat and Seche Vite top coat.  If you aren&#x27;t as diligent your results may be different.  I tend to have very oily nail beds and polish doesn&#x27;t like to adhere to my nails hence my multi step process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The variety of colors was really surprising, I received creams, shimmers, pearlescents, holos, neons,glitters, and mattes.  If I could be assured I wouldn&#x27;t have any repeats in color I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to order a second set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail polish remover pads while a nice addition pretty much suck.  They are non-acetone, conditioning, and take a lot of elbow grease to actually remove the polish.</li>
    <li> I took a chance on this and am glad that I did. I got no repeated colors, they were all good quality and they are in perfect condition. I was very happy with this order.</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my Birthday, the shipping was fast and received them before my Birthday so I was extremely happy with that.&lt;br /&gt;I did get one duplicate and a Holo green which was hard to open and it was thick as if it was old or had been used so I reached out to the seller and asked for a polish I really wanted to replace the dupe that I didn&#x27;t get it in the set, originally I had though it came in the set. Than I asked to exchange the holo green for a new one. It took one message and the lady was extremely nice and had it in the mail the next day! So I thank them for that! There was no hassle what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I have a lot of polishes. I really am a nail polish junky. I have no business buying more it&#x27;s ridic! Baha. But what I love about these, is that they stay on longer than any of my other polishes and I noticed that the first time I used them. My polishes with a base and clear coat will start chipping within a couple of days, I mean who doesn&#x27;t have that problem right? But the first time I painted my nails with the new Kleancolor polishes I got (Which I had never tried before might I add) I had my nail polish on a week before they even started to chip, shoot I had my nails the same color for almost 2 weeks before redoing them. ^^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also got the scented nail polisher remover pads which I wasn&#x27;t really expecting them to be all that great but to be honest with you, but they actually work quite well. I would definitely purchase them again. My only concern is that when using them, they are greasy!! I don&#x27;t know if anyone else had that problem but yes they are very greasy. So when using them I keep baby wipes or something on my dresser. That&#x27;s because I&#x27;m always in my room and when I go to open my door the knob gets all greasy from the remover pads hahaha. So heads up on that, otherwise guys, these polishes are awesome. The removers work just fine and for $40 you are getting a great set not to mention you are getting 48 polishes! Definitely recommend these polishes to anyone who enjoys doing their nails! I recommend them at my work all the time! : )</li>
    <li> Got this wonderful set to add to my enourmous polish supply. I did not get any duplicates and none were broken upon shipping. One bottle did come open a bit but it did not create too much of a mess. They don&#x27;t smell like normal nail polish but that is not a problem and does not affect the polish itself. They seem to be typical 2 coats polishes and go on smoothly and hold up pretty good...especially for the price. I got a great variety of regular mattes, shiney, glitters, chromes and even a clear hardener.</li>
    <li> The picture of these nail polishes does them very little justice. I had planned to order them and pass about half off to friends for them to sort through. I was extremely happy with all of the colors, though, so my friends will just be deprived (or they can order their own set). Lots of confetti glitter, sparkles, shimmers, and pearlescent colors. A few plain colors mixed in too. An excellent bargain for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coverage on the colors that I experimented with so far has been outstanding. One coat did the trick. I was expecting dollar store quality at these prices, but was very pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When your polishes come in, open each cap and inspect the brush. Two of mine had defective brushes and were unusable.</li>
    <li> pros: there were a lot of colors, and the size of the bottle was good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons: the polish STANK, some of the polishes were separated when I got them, and you need A LOT of nail polish remover to get this stuff off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, I would steer clear of this product. its not as good as they say it is.</li>
    <li> Very good paintings buy them as I seemed good option to save money in my country and have diversity in color; I thought I would have two packages for each color but sent the 48 completely different colors which charm me , there is only one detail is that there are some paintings that are a little thick but with a special solvent for the glazes also can use. I plan to buy more of these nail polishes in shades one I have not.</li>
    <li> Love the colors!!!! Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this purchase.  I did receive this package a few days later than expected but it was not an issue.  There was exactly 48 colors no duplicates and no spills.  The packaging was not the best, nail polished was wrapped in brown paper only, but again nothing broke or leaked.  The colors are wonderful so many to choose from.  There was one color in the picture that I wanted but did not receive but it was not a big deal because the other colors made up for it.  There is a lot of glitters and shimmers but that is not an issue for me.  I have a holo for each of the basic colors (blue, green, red, pink, and purple).  I have tried some of the colors and only a few would need more than two reapplies.  Overall, I am very happy with this product and can not wait to use it for stamping.  Happy coloring!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s birthday not one came broken all the colors are great my niece came over to do her nails and she loved it SO much she begged her mom to buy it.My daughter loved it she literly does her nails every two days.Today she&#x27;s doing water marbling.It came with about 10 chunky glitters and 8 regular glitters has every single color you could think of.I ordered her a spice rack to display them (same thing as a nail polish holder only cheaper because its for spices) The only thing that we could do without are the nail polish remover pads they smell great but they take nothing off and just make your nails sticky. Over all i give this product 1000000 stars! Any nail polish lover should buy this product. And if your wondering no they are not the sample bottles there the full size kleancolor nail polishes!</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I received these.  It felt like Christmas morning unwrapping every bottle.  Every color was different and I love them all! The only problem I have is I don&#x27;t know what color to paint my nails now!!! :)</li>
    <li> These polishes are pretty good for the price. I&#x27;ve had them for a little over a month now and I&#x27;ve learned that the majority of them take a really long time to dry. Anything over two coats doesn&#x27;t dry at all. kleancolor is definatly not my go to polish but they work well for stamping. I read all of the reviews before buying so I already knew about the slow drying time and the offensive smell of the polish.</li>
    <li> I received my 48 piece nail polish set about a week ago and I love it! There are so many colors to chose from whether it&#x27;s a solid color, metallic or glitter! I have a konad nail stamping kit and trying to find nail polish that worked with that was difficult, but the colors I&#x27;ve tried have worked perfectly! I have used this set quite a few times between stamping and water marble and the polish seems to last. It has many different shades of every color, even black and a matte clear coat, which is really cool. The only color that wasn&#x27;t in the set was white, which I always have for French manicures anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews said they received the same scent of the nail polish remover pads, but I didn&#x27;t have that problem. I am not a big fan of these because they are oily and I generally need to clean up my nail when I&#x27;m done painting, but since they are pads, your fingernail comes in contact with them and smudges the finished product. Regardless, I didn&#x27;t purchase the set for the nail polish remover pads so this wasn&#x27;t an issue. I love this set and if I ever run out, I will purchase the same set again!</li>
    <li> Absolutely In Love, They packaged them perfectly, no broken bottle &amp; the colors are beautiful can&#x27;t wait to try them out!</li>
    <li> I ordered this set because of the variety of colors I thought would be included, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed!! I got so many different colors including neon&#x27;s, glitters, pastels, metallic, and a couple chunky holo&#x27;s!! I ordered from MissPinkCat and shipping was really fast, I received my package 2 days after it was shipped from California, I live in Florida. I will definitely be ordering from her again, probably the 24 piece set so I can choose the colors I want and not get duplicates!! I&#x27;m including some pics of the colors I received and how they were packaged.</li>
    <li> Initially I was a bit hesitant about ordering this product because I didn&#x27;t know the brand and they were very cheap, but after reading other reviews I decided to give it a go and I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get any double colours and the polishes were all individually wrapped so none of them broke during shipment. The colours are all very nice and there are loads of pretty glitters of various concentration levels - some glitters are very sheer so they can only really be used as a top coat while others are very dense and can be used on their own. The quality of all polishes is good, they don&#x27;t go on streaky for me at all, although you will need 2 layers to get the full colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think it&#x27;s a great product, definitely worth the money :)</li>
    <li> I have ordered this nail polish ket from misspinkcat and I recommend it!  I have asked the seller for the colors I wanted and I got every single one!  This product is good for kids and teens but if you are an adult and don&#x27;t like glitters and neons, well this product is not of for you. I got this product in about 3 business days! This are not minis, they are full size!  They take about the normal time to dry and only about 2 coats. There was a lot of holos that I asked for too!  If you considered on buying this product I definitely prefer this product if your into different and funky colors. It is great for someone birthday too! I had no leakage or damage and the removal pads work very good! I would explain the cons but there isn&#x27;t any!  Each nail polish was wrapped individual.  I definitely do not regret buying this!</li>
    <li> i got SOME colors that i liked, a lot of pinks which im okay with but they were all relatively the same color pinks ( they all looked the same &#x3D;/ ) so that was kind of a bummer. and the biggest down fall of them all was that i had the same open bottle experience as one of the other reviews except that I LOST THE WHOLE BOTTLE!!! so i only got 47 colors... RIP OFF! and i had to clean off 10 bottles... LAME! So who ever packs these bottles before they get sent out, needs to tighten the bottles because their doing a horrible job.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B005H8PTR4 48 Piece Rainbow Colors Glitter Nail Polish Lacquer Set + 3 Scented Nail Polsih Remover]]</li>
    <li> Was nervous to buy this set because of the cheap price and mixed reviews.  TRUST THE REVIEWS THAT GIVE BOTH PROS AND CONS! I&#x27;m glad I did because there were no surprises (that&#x27;s why I gave 4 stars) I Got all polishes and polish removers as promised with no duplicates. Packaging was very protective, although one of the polishes slightly leaked from it&#x27;s lid not being tight enough (In fact, all the lids were a bit loose). There is a great selection of colors... All the \\&quot;solid\\&quot; colors cover with one coat, dry withing a few mins, and have a \\&quot;matte\\&quot; appearance (so you will need a quality top coat.. like China Glaze or Finger Paints). The \\&quot;glittery\\&quot; colors have a great sparkle, but come out translucent with little color (I apply these as top coats to solid polishes with similar hues) and they also stay \\&quot;gummy\\&quot; for awhile... took about an hour to dry. I haven&#x27;t tested them with my nail plates/stamps, so hopefully they work! This is a great buy for those who are patient/have time to do their nails. Only negative feedback would be to tighten the lids more and wish the polish would dry faster!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife who is a nail freak. There is a very good selection of colors and I didn&#x27;t immediately notice any duplicates, although I only briefly looked over them. I would assume they are colors she would like, and with 48 options to choose from I think there will be many she will use and what she doesn&#x27;t she can regift to nieces and friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what happened in shipping, but it arrived 3 days after the last estimated ship date even though it had 2 day post on it. Also 1 of the bottles was open and spilled all over several of the other bottles. Unfortunately it was one of the nicer colors of the whole batch. The bottles were not shipped as advertised in the pictures on the listing with the nice mesh individual wrapping. They were 8 small boxes with 6 bottles inside each box that were only separated by a very thin sliver of cardboard, providing little to no protection against breakage. Not worth it to attempt a return so will just clean them up and try to wrap up what I can as it&#x27;s a Christmas present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller did respond in a timely manner when contacted regarding shipping question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail polish remover may very well be scented, but it does not say so on the remover packages. They are actually acetone free nail polish removal pads that may not actually work well considering I know my wife uses an acetone liquid to remove her polish now. But again, she may be able to regift these to a niece or friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one polish that was open had a very strong scent to it. It may have just been because it was hot in the mailbox and the scent was trapped inside the box. But I think I can safely say that this particular polish has a very strong scent and should be used in a well ventilated room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am satisfied with this purchase, although the shipping method and speed, including packaging, leave much to be desired. I would recommend this item and it may be another future purchase once my wife exhausts all of these bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: The nail polish remover pads actually do list scents on the back label in small writing.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of buying this due to the reviews but I got some great stuff! Most of the polishes came in a 6 pack box then a few were wrapped well in bubble wrap. Nothing leaked nothing broken and I got a good variety of colors. From pastels, glitters, shimmer, dark, matte,glittering stars all kinds of stuff. Well worth the money seems to be quality stuff.</li>
    <li> I did not get a single repeat, and got many of the colors shown in the picture. Some of the hsades are very interesting and nothing like the shades I owned previously which mad me happy :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are very pigmented, and only need one to two coats for a good all over coverage, and many of the darker or more metallic shade will work with Konad(or other brand) stampers which made me OVER THE MOON HAPPY! its hard enough finding inexpressive nail polish that will work with my KONAD but I got atleast 10 of em in this lot, for dirt cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a funny smell but not awful, better then most nail polishes. My roommate says it smells like twizzlers to her lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for a gift or a polish addict like myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was secure and organized, not a single broken bottle. The only damage was one bottle was slightly open and when alittle leaked it sealed the top to the bottle, but with some remover and elbow grease I got it open and working. Will come in a large box with individual boxes of I think it was 6 polishes per box, if you dont own a nail rack using the boxes could be useful for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hope that helps&lt;br /&gt;IN LOVE!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting there to be so many bright and pretty colors! I&#x27;m very happy with it :) Price wan&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> I recived it on time,but a few of the nail polishes was leaking but other than that everything was fine.</li>
    <li> Daughter loved them.none were broken</li>
    <li> Gorgeous colors and a great price</li>
    <li> great my grandaughter loved it. thanks</li>
    <li> Great prize, Incredibly fast shipping. Very well packaged. Soo many beautiful colors, no repeats. YOU MUST BUY THIS.</li>
    <li> This was my daugther birthday present, she love doing her nails&lt;br /&gt;I had the impresion that maybe the color will be soft...&lt;br /&gt;for my surprise with just 2 hands is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all the colors are beautifull and good quality.</li>
    <li> The package came with all nail polishes intact.  One nail polish has an issue where the lid will not close properly so I might contact them about that but all in all this was a great purchase.  The nail polish goes on better than all of the polishes I have been using for years.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> It took FOREVER for this to come, and I got LOADS of multiples, over half of them actually. The polish isn&#x27;t that great of quality either, it peels off in one big piece even if I use things that are supposed to help with that not happening.</li>
    <li> Ever since i got fake nails over the summer my nails have been a mess, and i have had to paint my nails everyday to make sure that no one can see the hideous nail that is behind the gorgeous polish. Eventually i got tired of using the same five colors day after day, so when i came across this package i was shocked! This set is wonderful, the quality is amazing and there is almost every color you could ever think of! This was an absolutely phenomenal purchase and i would recommend this to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(p.s. it got to my house super quick and none of them were broken!)</li>
    <li> I cannot tell you how amazing this is! I received all 48 nail polishes. i love every single color and I have not tried out all of them yet! cant wait to do so. totally recommend this product! im in love &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I bought these for my 13 &amp; 15 year old nieces. Over half of them are not glittery and will probably just be thrown away. Still not a bad price for the 18 or so that they will actually use. The glitter ones are pretty and I only got one duplicate which is fine because it was a very pretty glitter color. They do take awhile to dry but keeps them busy for awhile and they have a lot of fun.</li>
    <li> Comes off fast but come with a huge assortment of colors so it&#x27;s worth the money. My daughter loves them!</li>
    <li> OMG!!! this is the most awesome thing ever and the price i thought was perfectly fair!!!&lt;br /&gt;one of the tops got cracked and i was going to email them about it so the would replace the bottle but then i found out that they have a top over the top, which is perfectly fine by me as long as it doesn&#x27;t dry out (which im 100% sure it wont) i am super pleased with this and i know i will be buy from these guys again because it would make a perfect present for my mother or sister since we are obsessed with our nails XD</li>
    <li> Love this set. It is an amazing value witha great selection of colors. The nail polish is high quality with a very nice formula. Came packaged very carefully with no broken bottles or any leaking nail polish. Seller is amazing as well. I accidentally receieved 2 barbie pink polishes instead of the holo chrome I was wanting. I sent the seller an email and within 5 minutes I had a very polite response stating that they would immediately correct the issue and send me holo chrome free of charge. Wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to order from them in the future, 5 stars for both product and seller. Great experience ordering with them. Seller was Mighty Gadget USA.</li>
    <li> I love the colors in this set. The scented polish removers don&#x27;t work but I didn&#x27;t buy the set for them so no money wasted in my opinion. The polishes arrived on time and in tact, none of the bottles were broken but some had leaked prior to being shipped. I know this because there was no polish in the boxes they were shipped in. Overall I am very happy with my purchase and I can&#x27;t wait use these polishes in my future nail art designs!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a lifelong problem with raggedy cuticles and nail-biting, and once in a while I get into a kick of trying to take care of my nails. I recently embarked on just such a kick - first I started off with just clear Sally Hansen base/top coat, then I started using some leftover nail polish from my last jaunt. Then I started getting interested in wearing glitters and funky colors. I saw this 48-piece set on Amazon and couldn&#x27;t resist treating myself - I was a little concerned after reading a lot of negative reviews, but . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My set arrived quickly - within a few days. All of the polishes were packed in 8 boxes with 6-per-box. All of the bottles were well sealed with no leakage. I got 47 unique colors and 1 repeat - which was a little weird, because both bottles said \\&quot;30 Pinky Moon\\&quot; but they were actually different colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping to get more holos, but only got one. I&#x27;d say the set is about half neons, with the rest being a fairly decent distribution of glitters, pastels, and more traditional colors. Although I&#x27;m pretty certain that the neons and glitters aren&#x27;t appropriate for a woman my age (no, I&#x27;m not revealing it), I decided that it&#x27;s bad enough that nature MAKES us grow older, and there&#x27;s no reason not to have a little fun with something as trivial as nail polish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hard on my nails and hands - I swim, I type, I do a lot of dishes by hand, so I don&#x27;t expect a polish to last more than 2 or 3 days anyway. With so many colors, it&#x27;s not so bad to change my polish a couple of times a week, so I don&#x27;t care. Most of the polishes smell about the same as other polishes I&#x27;ve used, but some reviewers are right about some of the polishes smelling just awful. I put on the Metallic Aqua last night and the odor is like getting punched in the face, but the color is so pretty it makes up for it. I&#x27;m not the best self-manicurist and can get a little sloppy (especially since I started with the glitters, and mistakes don&#x27;t show up as much with those), but the polish cleans easily from the skin around my nails after I&#x27;m done. I only use a base, a coat, and a topcoat and the colors have proven to be vibrant and very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vendor that I bought it from was Kolorize. I was very satisfied with the transaction.h with those), but the polish cleans easily from the skin around my nails after I&#x27;m done. I only use a base, a coat, and a topcoat and the colors have proven to be vibrant and very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vendor that I bought it from was Kolorize. I was very satisfied with the transaction.</li>
    <li> Love this! Lots of nail polishes. I got like 10 textured nail polishes which I like, another 10 scented nail polishes, a couple of chunky nail glitter polishes &amp; a couple of metallic colors. I like all the polishes I received. Unfortunately, 1 of the polishes came cracked &amp; dried up. A number of other polishes had dried polish spilled and stuck around the top which had to be picked off, no big deal. I am happy &amp; those nail polish removers are great! Very oily/greasy but not drying at all, the smell is very alcohol-y smell but not bad. I will buy from again</li>
    <li> This is a great set of nail polish for anyone who is really big on painting their nails a different color every couple days.  Some duplicates did arrive in set, which means they pulls the colors at random.</li>
    <li> Lots of polishes for the price.  I would say only a few were colors we didn&#x27;t like out of the entire selection.  Colors are vibrant, on trend and last well.  The scented one?  Didn&#x27;t notice any scent.  Maybe they were the bottles that broke during shipping?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason it&#x27;s not getting a five star review is three bottles arrived broken and had spilled out in the little boxes they are packaged in.  It took a good hour to clean it up and even now, there is still dried on, spilled polish on some of the bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy the set, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these to give as Christmas presents this year. I am super stoked to see the look on their faces when then open their gift and see 48 different colors of nail polish. Think I might buy one for myself!</li>
    <li> I had purchased this nail polish on christmas, and i got it yesterday. It came very quick, and i am so happy with the nail polish i purchased! It was well worth it, and also all of the colors i love especialy the neon one&#x27;s, and the sparkily ones. I highly reccomend this!</li>
    <li> The nail polish didn&#x27;t come in a case. They were mailed in the box individually wrapped in paper. But, none of the nail polish was broken and the colors are pretty nice.</li>
    <li> They came in a box packed very well. No repeat on the colors. Very pleased with the service and price.</li>
    <li> Got set for my daughter, she loved all the bright colors.  The nail polish remover included is not so good.</li>
    <li> This product came with two broken bottles of nail polish, this could have been avoided with proper packaging. I contacted the seller three times over a month and never heard from them.  The product itself has a great variety of colors and textures; however, they do not last more than 2  days with out chipping off.</li>
    <li> I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THIS PRODUCT IS SO CHEAPLY PRICED.&lt;br /&gt;honestly, it works just as great as any other.&lt;br /&gt;in fact, i say it works even better than Essie because Essie doesn&#x27;t show the color on the bottle when you put it on your nails, but these polishes show the actual exact identical color!&lt;br /&gt;love it, and can&#x27;t get enough of it.&lt;br /&gt;i change my nails every single day. legit.</li>
    <li> I just got the polishes in this morning.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but I looked at a few of them and can tell already that their going to be amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I feel bad for those people who got broken ones shipped to them. Mine were all in boxes, so none were broken.&lt;br /&gt;As for the colors, they are all so amazing. Now, if you excuse me, I have some nails to paint XD</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to everyone.  Great fashion colors, quick drying time and you can&#x27;t beat the price for the selection.</li>
    <li> I ordered this set for my 12 year old daughter for Christmas, expecting the quality to be mediocre. I was pleasantly surprised when I used the polish for myself and realized just how good of a quality it was. I actually ordered all of the neons from the same brand and they were just as good. The colors are bright, the polishes are thick and they stay on well (with clear coat, of course). We use them with the Konad nail stamper set and they work just great.</li>
    <li> I received these polishes in perfect condition (all individually wrapped) and the colors are great. They are full size polishes, frankly I was expecting them to be mini bottles. They stay on my toes well, no complaints at all. You can&#x27;t buy polish this cheap at this quality at dollar stores!</li>
    <li> Just as described. Great colors!</li>
    <li> There was glitter, scented, 3d Textured, and Matt in my box.. very pretty colors.</li>
    <li> I love the Variety of colors and glitters I received, and I was especially excited about the Matte Top Coat that came in my set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However... I did have one problem.&lt;br /&gt;When I got the box it looked like someone beat the crap out of it with a baseball bat, and when I opened it one of the polishes (that I loved) was broken. This broken my heart, but I was very lucky only one broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The remover pads work better than anything I have ever had before,and I will probably be buying another set in the future...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I would suggest that before the boxes are shipped \\&quot;fragile\\&quot; should be printed on it somewhere. So precious, beautiful colors, don&#x27;t end up broken like mine.</li>
    <li> ALL I GOTTA SAY ABOUT THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING I LOVE IT I GOT IT IN A GOOD TIMELY MANNER AND EVERYTHING WAS IN TACT ALL THE POLISHES ARE GREAT AND LAST A ONTH IF APPLIED WELL WITH LITTLE TO NO CHIPAGE YOU DO NEED A GOOD TOP COAT OVER ALL VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT WILL DEFENATLY BUY AGAIN... FYI IF YOU WANT VARIETY AND A GOOD PRODUCT THIS IS DEFENATLY WORTH YOUR MONEY!!</li>
    <li> Gahhhhh! I absolutely love this purchase. I was as excited as a kid on Christmas morning opening these up inividually, each one opened a new favorite. I yearned for more fingers so that I could try out each new color, but a silver lining!...the scented nail polish remover came in handy after my nails couldn&#x27;t hold any more polish, and it works like magic. I can get all the color off ALL my nails, no matter the color, with only one pad. I am soooo happy I found this and will definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> Love the nailpolish and it also comes with a great selection of colors! :)</li>
    <li> I really like he variety of colors, but i hate the smell. The smell is so over bearing, its crazy!!! You literally have to paint your nails outside!! but the colors are great!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this set for my granddaughter as a gift.  The bottles are very nice and the colors are great but I was very disappointed that one of the polishes had broken completely in half and leaked all over 8 other bottles.  I was able to clean up the bottles with nail polish remover but bet that those bottles will be hard to open with the green nailpolish embedded in the grooves.  Also, the smell was extremely strong from that one bottle.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price!</li>
    <li> I think for the price, it&#x27;s worth it. Considering your bottles are coming out to about a dollar each, it&#x27;s not too bad. A few that I got were really gloppy and don&#x27;t work so well, but I ended up with a really good variety. The scented polish smell wears off pretty quickly, but the textured ones are awesome! The scented nail polish remover pads are garbage though.</li>
    <li> Treat shipping and great product</li>
    <li> Okay so like another reviewer said I bought two sets from the seller misspinkcat  one was labeled rainbow and glitter colors, the other was labeled trendy colors. Looking at both pics I only saw what looked like a few duplicates between the two different sets. So I bought them both thinking I&#x27;d get at least 70 or 80 different colors. Well I hadn&#x27;t seen the other persons review until after I ordered so I was worried after reading it as I&#x27;d already ordered the two \\&quot;different\\&quot; sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The numbers: both sets came with 48 polishes \\&quot;no duplicates\\&quot; so I expected 96 nail polishes with very few duplicates among them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box arrived and the polishes were packed with the blue net things, nothing was broken although some bottles did have polish on them. Not a big deal. At first I was really pleased going through them I set aside all the duplicates and I told myself if there&#x27;s 10 duplicates I&#x27;ll take it down to four stars. In the end I had 27 polishes with duplicates, one polish I had three of. Which was highly disappointing because they all came in one box from the same seller, so the seller was well aware I was a single buyer, who had bought what was advertised as two \\&quot;different\\&quot; sets of 48 nail polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So deducting the duplicates and the one triple, I received a total of 68 different colors of the 96 bottles. For $86 bucks  I felt the seller could have kept the duplicates to less than 10. I have nearly 30 bottles of duplicate polish I&#x27;ll be giving away because of this. That is nearly an entire \\&quot;set\\&quot; of duplicates. So I can see why the other reviewer was so angry. Based on the numbers on the bottles the kleancolor nail line has plenty enough shades for there to have been few or no duplicates. For anyone that doesn&#x27;t understand what the other reviewer is talking about, the problem is that the seller is advertising two DIFFERENT sets of 48 nail polishes, so when you buy both sets you expect ideally 96 DIFFERENT colors. I personally could have forgiven up to ten duplicates, but 27 is just a bit messed up on the sellers part. This seller should not list these as two different sets unless theyre going to handpick 96 DIFFERENT  colors for the buy that buys both sets at once. Calling and selling these as two DIFFERENT sets is untrue and extremely misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The positive, the reason the product got the three stars is because I did get two holographic shades I was pleased with and of the 68 different colors I am overall pretty pleased with it though the seller was a bit heavy on the purple shades. This could have just been so much better with few duplicates. That parts hard to swallow. I&#x27;ve also read the seller doesn&#x27;t respond and because I like my 68 shades well enough to not pursue action through amazon I am reviewing the product here as being an \\&quot;okay\\&quot; buy. If this were a traffic light this is a yellow light purchase to be made with extreme caution, it may or may not be worth it to you. I will be leaving negative seller feedback for misspinkcat but the product itself is \\&quot;okay\\&quot; this particular set, mixed with pink cats \\&quot;other\\&quot; set I&#x27;d strongly advise against.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a birthday gift to myself only based on the previous reviews I had read, and I am sooooo glad I did!! I received 48 different colors, each was individually wrapped in paper and put into a box. I was a little concerned when I received the package because it didn&#x27;t look that secure, but everything was in tact! No leaks, no breaks, no mess :) The shipping was quick, I received it within 7 days! All and all I am absolutely happy with my purchase, it was worth every penny :)</li>
    <li> If I could give them more than 5 stars I would. I am so happy with this purchase and their customer service. My package came exactly on the expected date. The packaging was great. They came in the white boxes that they display which has these little dividers but tons of bubble wrap to secure the polish in transit. The colors are so beautiful, the pictures could never do them justice. There are no repeats of the colors at all, you get 48 completely different shades or glitters. One of my bottles had some of the nail polish around the cap and when I went to open to see why it had leaked out the rim of the bottle where the cap screws on was broken not from the packaging but probably because it was screwed on too tightly when manufactured. I contacted the seller regarding the broken bottle and they responded immediately saying that they would replace the item and it would be shipped out the same day to me. How is that for customer service!!!! I would definitely recommend this product for not only the quality of the product, did I mention how beautiful and vivid the polishes are, but also for the customer satisfaction provided by the seller. Will be buying from them again and will be seeing what other products they have available that I require.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: They sent me the nail polish that was broken quickly and now I am so happy with this company that I am now ordering another set for my mother in law for Mothers Day.</li>
    <li> love will buy again shipped fast as well.</li>
    <li> Its nice to have alot of nail polish, works will with designs and just flat out painting them, but drys fast but not good with water marbeling. And i did get a lid handle part that had a good crack the bottle perfectly fine though so id say its ok</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love. The nail polish is absolutely gorgeous. I notice Kleancolor has unique colors. Very vibrant. The holo&#x27;s are my favorite. They&#x27;re very cool. My package came with one duplicate. I&#x27;m not mad because the color is actually pretty. I received shimmer&#x27;s, Neons, glitters, holo&#x27;s, and solids. Besides the time it took for it to come (I was honestly getting impatient.) I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;The free nail polish remover is pretty good. They smell good. 10x better than the regular smell of polish remover. It&#x27;s oily, but it&#x27;s mixed with cuticle oil.  Just wash your hands with soap afterwards and your all set. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> these are some great naill polish to use in a salon i had on mine for a month i am loving it.</li>
    <li> The nail polish chips sooo easily. Doesnt last 1 day! Kinda mad I spent so much money on it. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my 12 year old daughter who is a nail design fanatic.  For some odd reason we received a double set of these even though we only paid for one set.  However....and here is the but....I would happily mail them back to whatever Chinese warehouse they came from:  They dry EXTREMELY slowly and they have a HORRIBLE smell that I lay awake at night imagining is some horrid toxic chemical that I have now bestowed upon my child.  I am looking to give the set to someone we don&#x27;t like and purchase a quality set and this will be a case of \\&quot;you get what you pay for.\\&quot;  I highly recommend the \\&quot;Zoya\\&quot; brand. Professional quality, dries very quickly and doesn&#x27;t chip at all.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a really good deal and it still might be for someone who likes to polish very regularly, but none of the polish (in any color) lasted so long for me...maybe a few days without chipping, even on my toes which don&#x27;t get a lot of wear per say.  I even used a high quality top coat that works very well on different brands.  My normal polish will stay on for weeks (toes), but not this.  The colors are lovely and varied.  I got a lot of glittery ones in my batch and springish colors.  Some were a bit gooey and I had to add polish remover to make them coat correctly...maybe old, I&#x27;m not sure.  Overall, this was an okay buy for me.  I will still use them but only if I know I will have time to repolish relatively quickly as the polish doesn&#x27;t stay on my nails long without chipping horribly.  They were actually all Kleancolor brand and came nicely packaged...no broken ones or funny smells that other reviewers have proclaimed.  I will say that the polish remover pads where not spectacular...too small/thin so you basically need 3 for one nail to get the old polish off and use the whole container in one sitting.</li>
    <li> When it comes to this nail polish, you get what you pay for and I wish I had known that. Usually you can buy sinful colors or wet and wild at drugstores for $1-2$ a piece and I would recommend that over these Kleancolor polishes. 90% of them are tacky, they never dry fully on my nails. They are expired or something because when I take the brush out of the bottle, the polish is already tacky being in the air for 5 seconds. I cannot get a smooth manicure that dries.They chip away easily...and smell bad. I noticed that when I painted my nails on a Styrofoam dish, if the polish got on it it would literally eat a hole through the plate! None of my other polishes did this! Imagine what these are doing to your nails. Do not waste your money on these cheap polishes.</li>
    <li> So I ordered this a while back and I really like the bright or deep colors because you don&#x27;t need more than two coats for those colors. As for the light colors you need a lot of coats and it takes a while to dry. The glitter polishes I hardly use because they are really thick and take way to much time to dry, but I only got a few of those so it&#x27;s fine!</li>
    <li> I love this set.I got this from my sis as a gift for christmas and i love this set. I will use this set as much as posibble. It works great as well though the ones with the starts and stuff is alittle harder to use its still good. I really really love this set alos got no repeats in nail polish colors... &lt;3</li>
    <li> This polish is AMAZING! The bundle shipped within a reasonable time (not slow at all but not exactly speedy) and was packaged decently. None of my bottles were broken or leaking like some other reviews have mentioned. The selection was spectacular and the quality is THE BEST! I&#x27;ve never had such great coverage from a polish. One coat is all it took. Can&#x27;t wait to sit down and do my nails on a regular basis now! *I even pulled a Pinterest project and used it to paint the top of my keys to keep them separate. I used a sky blue for the base then used the silver/blue glitter over it once it dried. Super Cute!*</li>
    <li> amazing assortment of colors, all individually wrapped. great quality polish, although it does take a while to dry. love it.</li>
    <li> The product size was fine, but the quality was lacking. There were visible scratches on the plastic, and you can see excess glue between shelves. It wasn&#x27;t as noticeable when filled with nail polish.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Grandaughter!  I was a major hit at Christmas.  All of her cousins and friends have made appointments to get their nails done.</li>
    <li> Basically $1 / full sized bottle. Got a great variety of polishes in all different colors and types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Girlfriend was thrilled with this.</li>
    <li> Love all the colors and the packaging was shipped with care. Packaged very well! Great buy!</li>
    <li> The purchase was planned for 48 Klean Color nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Receive 47 paintings and 1 broken; addition, 10 nail polish brand was not requested, were MAX MAKEUP cherimoya. Why did this happen?</li>
    <li> For the price, I think this is an awesome surprise for any nail enthusiast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this set for my girlfriend and she loved it! Unless your girlfriend or wife is snooty about her nail products, this is a fun buy! Lots of colors and textures.&lt;br /&gt;She also said it seemed like quality nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If giving as a gift, it&#x27;s pretty plainly packaged. I didn&#x27;t make it my only present of course and re-wrapped the boxes after inspection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For any girl who likes lots of colors, this can be a fun gift!!</li>
    <li> We gave the nail polish as a gift at a women&#x27;s event and it was a big hit. The colors are vibrant, fun and very pretty.We highly recommend this product. You will not be disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> I must admit, I kind of have an addiction to nail polish, only because I&#x27;m addicting to painting my nails. (Almost everyday I change the color) So, when I saw this I jumped at it! I absolutely LOVE this, it was a great deal; 48 diff colors AND 3 polish removers. Very gladd I bought it! :)) ..Although my husbands not so much LOL. (I have too much nail polish apparently) Thanks though totally love this!!!</li>
    <li> My review is both about the product and the packaging.  Both were beautifully and carefully put together.  Each bottle of nail polish was separately wrapped and securely fitted together.  Kudos to the thoughtful seller.  The polish is smooth and delicious, it even comes with 3 scented polish removers.  The colors are bright and like a feast for the eye.  I recommend the many uses for such a colorful product without reservation.  And  you thought I bought it just for my nails?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one recommendation is to Amazon.  The timing assigned to the seller to package and send this product was but one week.  Some products are given much longer and I fail to see the advantage of a rush job.  The seller contacted me because of a delay in delivery.  I could see their dilemma.  Please allow more time for deliveries of this kind.  In the end, I benefited by a safe and well-packed delivery and that&#x27;s as important as getting it at all!</li>
    <li> I am truly a nail polish addict and have seen a lot of Kleancolor polishes online. Every place that has them they look cheap (about $1-$1.50), but then it comes to check out and the shipping is something like $3-$5 for a single polish! No thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw this deal I could not take my mind off of it! The price is truly unbeatable but I was a little hesitant about spending so much on nail polish in one go. Also, after looking at the pictures I was worried about polishes breaking in transit. I actually got this as a gift for my birthday, it came MUCH earlier then anticipated. It was estimated to arrive on/by the 17 and it came on the 12th. The box was a Medium flat rate shipping box from USPS and had some weight to it but I could not hear any moving around. I held by breath as a I opened it and was very pleasantly surprised to see that the sellers have really changed how they ship the polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather then the blue net and bubble wrap I&#x27;ve been seeing in pictures, mine came all packaged in boxes of 6 polishes to a box, each separated by a small cardboard divider and stuffed with bubble wrap. 6 boxes line the bottom of the box and the other two are on top (8 boxes x 6 polishes to a box &#x3D; 48 polishes). The two that are on top are also surrounded with bubble wrap and the nail polish remover pads were on top as well. I will be taking pictures to show this better. Also, each box says Kleancolor on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are all perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say though that I was very disappointed that I did not get Holo Chrome as another reviewer said they did but overall I still give this a 5 because all the other colors are amazing, shipping time was fantastic, the price is VERY reasonable, and no polishes were broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to mention that from what I have been able to find Kleancolor is NOT Big 3 Free ( meaning they contain Dibutyl Phthalate (DBP), Formaldehyde and Toluene). Many nail polishes have stopped using them because of thesupposed toxicity. If you would like more information on 3 Free, or what exactly these products are/do check out All Liquered Up&#x27;s blog at [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it would also be beneficial if those of us who have gotten this lot put up what colors we received to see if it is maybe random, or there is something to it. I would love to buy the other set of polishes by this seller but I am worried that they will be the same ones as the seller did not provide a list of colors in each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep it up Laquer Heads! I&#x27;ll be posting pictures soon :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;I posted pictures of the packaging and the colors I got but I just want to post them here has well.&lt;br /&gt;These are the colors I got! Starting at the top from L-R:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;42 Sandstone, 148 Sheer Pastel Pink, 41 Pearl Beige, 89 Pink Star, 22 Barbie Pink, 82 Pink, 30 Pink Moon, 83 Pearl Sherry, 51 Brown (This has a LOT of red to it, it looks more like red clay then any brown shade I have seen), 160 Metallic Orange, 81 Red Alert, 21 Neon Fuschia, 107 Boogie Nights&lt;br /&gt;14 Neon Aqua, 13 Pearl Jungle, 119 Leaves Jingle, 17 Neon Green, 24 Bikini Green, 12 Melon Green, 18 Neon Yellow, 162 Metallic Yellow, 47 Gold Bright, 155 Chunky Copper, 137 My Rightful Throne, 19 Neon Orange, 23 Mango.&lt;br /&gt;25 Beach Blue, 33 Starry Blue, 96 Vegas Nights, 10 Sapphire, 125 Disco Purple, 15 Neon Sapphire, 234 Chunky Holo Purple, 36 Sparkle Purple, 235 Chunky Holo Bluebell (This and 234 are almost EXACTLY alike. Even swatching them there is LESS then a fourth of a shade difference in the jelly used for the glitter), 16 Neon Purple, 123 Lavenbaby, 87 Iridescent Fuschia, 127 Wild Rose, 90 Madly Matte, 104 Fashionista (seriously one of the most horrendous colors I have ever seen. It is caca brown. I will probably throw it away), 6 Charcoal, 31 Silver Star, 7 Pearl Silver, 225 Gorgeous Surprise, 230 Chunky Holo Fuchsia, 219 Lilac Spark, 153 Neon Amethyst.&lt;br /&gt;NAIL POLISH REMOVER PADS: Jasmine, Orchid, Rose. Each one has 38 Sheets.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good set but there are too many colors that look the same. 6 shades of purple, 7 shades of red, but only 1 blue?! Makes no sense! It was a very dark blue too it looked black!</li>
    <li> I received the package 2 days before the average shipping date. However, the package came while I was gone, and the delivery truck left a note that said that I had to sign a note or I would not receive the package. A little annoyed, I printed out a &#x27;sign form&#x27; and taped it to my door. These allow the delivery truck to leave the package there even if you are not home. So, the next day I came home and saw the package waiting for me. I opened it and found it packaged extremely well. There were 8 little cardboard boxes with six bottles of nail polish in them. They were sorted so that all of the blues were in one box, and all the pinks, and reds and so on. I looked inside and found that two bottles ( both blue ) had leaked out during the shipping. However, it wasn&#x27;t bad. I cleaned up the bottles and found that I had gotten one duplicate. It was a green/blue glitter. I didn&#x27;t really love the color so I gave away the duplicate. I found that I got 11 glitters, which at first I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about. I already have a lot of glitters, and I bought this mainly for the colors. But, I found that some of the glitters were really unique. For instance, one had a very thin light grey base, with silver and green squares mixed in. Another was a black gelish color with pink hearts in it. I didn&#x27;t receive any top or base coats, or a black. I did receive a ton of matte (9) colors in this package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve heard people complain about the smell a lot, and they are very right. The smell is not a normal nail polish smell, it is a odd smell. It is extremely strong, and stays on your nails even after they&#x27;re dry. But, if you need too, you can ignore it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The colors dry very fast, especially the matte ones, and look very nice. They do chip easily, but that can be avoided with a high quality top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Some of the brushes were bad, but I trimmed those down. These colors ( especially the darker ones ) WILL STAIN YOUR NAILS SO BE CAREFUL!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail polish remover pads are good, but he cuticle oil is so greasy I can&#x27;t stand it. It&#x27;s almost like rubbing maple syrup into your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All together, I am  happy about this purchase.he cuticle oil is so greasy I can&#x27;t stand it. It&#x27;s almost like rubbing maple syrup into your nails.     All together, I am  happy about this purchase.</li>
    <li> Still uses this. It was her favorite Christmas gift</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a wide variety of colors, and they go from flat to glittery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that they dry SO fast. I have never had enough patience to sit around and allow nail polish to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they chip. So easily. And when they start chipping off, you can just peel the rest of it off!&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and also... Some of the nail polishes came without brushes. They have the caps, but the brushes were missing!</li>
    <li> The price is great, they dry fast, I order to sets of them I have 96 different colors! no of them were duplicate :)  I love them!</li>
    <li> THIS IS MY FIRST TIME PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT SEEING ALL THE GOODS REVIEW AND IT WAS WITH IT. ALL THE COLORS WAS BEAUTIFUL NO DUPLICATE OR BROKEN. WORKS REALLY GOOD FOR A CHEAP PRICE. FAST SHIPPING AND WILL PURCHUSE AGAIN!!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect. Every color she could have asked for. The package came very quickly with no damage. Only one duplicate. Perfect for her birthday surprise.</li>
    <li> I brought this set because I wanted to build upon my current nail polish collection. It arrived very fast, which like liked. With the amount of colors KleanColor has to offer I was not happy with the color selection I got too many pinks, and only one red. One of the bottles looked like it had been opened or used because the bottle was not full like the rest of them. I didn&#x27;t have any bottles that was cracked or leaking, but I did have several tops cracked (9)which made them hard to open. No duplicates. Most of the colors are two coats, and they dry pretty fast for me. Would I purchase again? Probably not, not unless I can request the colors that I want. But if you are just starting your collection, I think this would be a great investment because it is not a bad price. One more thing, I got three nail polish pad remover and they were all dried out. Not a big deal, I just added nail polish remover to each container so I was able to use them. Just wanted to put that out there just in case the same thing has happen to anyone else.</li>
    <li> Awesome colors, but the odor of the nail polish is a bit strong. However overall I do love them and they are just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I purchased the 48 &amp;#34;rainbow&amp;#34; colors set. Inside the shipped box were small boxes containing 6polishes in each, although it doesn&#x27;t specify what colors you get (which I understand) I unfortunately received an entire small box (total of 6) that were the same dark purple color. So I only received a total of 43 assorted colors. Otherwise was fast shipping and packaged very well.</li>
    <li> Right packing just one came break but the rest are beautifull colors, and they came with a 3 polist kit</li>
    <li> OK, let me start out saying that I LOVE KLEANCOLOR!!! Ok... So I got this the other day and one of my polishes broke on the way to my house. Not cool... The polishes arrived in a box inside the box were smaller boxes with 6 polishes to the box.  Next I didn&#x27;t get a couple of the colors I was hoping for but did get a lot of beautiful creme colors and some nice chunky glitters (that I plan on doing glitter placement with!!!) I love the formula of Kleancolors polish. Ok lastly the polish removers... umm ok, they are no acetone which some people like I however LOVE acetone. They are make with some kind of oil... I guess it is like an essential oil that removes the polish I like that the oil \\&quot;helps\\&quot; dry cuticles but idk if it is supposed to burn... bc it did a little... so all in all I am extra happy with this set but I would be super stoked if I had got the few colors I was lacking... I would recommend this to friends though!</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my girfriend since shes starting to collect nail polishes. Received the package way before the estimated delivery date and everything came in perfect condition, nothing broken. Im very satisfied with the quality and shiping of the products and my girlfriend is gonna love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who does great nail art.  The selection is amazing and she was pleased but the quality is pretty bad.  The polish peels off really easily</li>
    <li> The nail polish set came in nice boxes, none were broken, arrived in due time and GREAT COLORS!!! Overall it is a great buy for anyone looking to start a variety collection, I did receive the rainbow colors as described!</li>
    <li> It was my first time purchasing anything from Amazon.com and i have to say i was very pleased. The package arrived safe and sound, and came in these little white boxes with like 6 in each. i inspected each one, none were broken and none were dried out. there were also three nail polish removers that came along with it, the colors are really pretty and i&#x27;m really satisfied. my one complaint would have to be the smell. it is kind of strong and can give you a headache. If your sensitive to smell then i suggest you either don&#x27;t buy it or open the window while you paint your nails. another thing i didn&#x27;t like was the remover.It works but it has cuticle oil on it that&#x27;s like really oily and unnecessary. plus their really tiny. but if i was to recommend this product i would, in the end you should be happy with them.</li>
    <li> I love all the colors and nothing was broken. I only had one duplicate color and I get them earlier than estimated. I will be buying from this company again. Love it</li>
    <li> I received my product and I just love it. The only tho g is I did get two of the same odors but I don&#x27;t mind because I do. Love the Olof that was double. They came unbroken nicely packaged and many great colors. I just love all 48 of them</li>
    <li> All of the nail polish came intact. And the shipping was lightning fast. Of course since you are paying such a low price, it is not going to be the best nail polish. However, I am a nail hobbyist and so I spend a lot of time and energy doing my nails. This being said, these nail polishes are totally fine as long as you sandwich the color between a base coat and a top coat. ALSO: Get some nail art brushes and then you have virtually every color you need to start painting random things on your nails!</li>
    <li> Ordered Friday 4/19/13 received Monday 4/22/13&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had so much fun with these! Great colors! I received a few more sparkles and metallics than solid colors, but that&#x27;s not enough to lose them a star. I&#x27;ll just have to order more to fill out my collection! The color goes on nice an smoothly. Haven&#x27;t experienced a whole lot of chipping, but I always apply basecoat first and top shine after. They also dry fast! I work at a kids salon where we specialize in spa parties for girls 4-11. We do manicures with nailart (with migipens which I loveloveLOVE), but were running into issues with the Zoya nail polish because it takes SOO long to dry. These are great colors that dry quickly and they will suit my purpose just fine.&lt;br /&gt;My nails (and others that have used them in the past few days) look fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;No duplicates. No broken bottles. They came in little white boxes with 7 per box and a few bubble wrapped in a small flat box laying across the top.&lt;br /&gt;As others have said, the nail polish remover pads work, but they leave a strange oily residue. Not broken up about that at all, after all, that&#x27;s not why I bought this collection!&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I should note that one of the colors I received is clear. Hardly a big deal to me. It makes a wonderful top coat!</li>
    <li> I received my order earlier than expected. I had anticipated on having a shipment of an array of Kleancolor polishes. Because that&#x27;s what I had searched for and that&#x27;s what it was affiliated with under my search. &amp;#34;48 Piece Rainbow Color Glitter Nail Polish Lacquer Set + 3 Scented Nail Polish Remover&amp;#34; Kleancolor. It was packed perfectly great, in each of own containers, total of 8, 6 polishes to a box. But what was strange, I only received 4 bottles of Kleancolor polishes and the rest was this generic crap of Max Makeup Cherimoya Nail Lacquer (Never heard of it and had to actually &#x27;Google&#x27; it to find out what type of brand it is). I like Kleancolor, I believe their brand is great for the value of it. I know there is much more of an array of polish colors out there in freaking world, but if the seller is going to post a 48 piece set for such a great value, don&#x27;t affiliate it with Kleancolor if it&#x27;s going to be a bogus sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am bummed out because these were going to be bridal shower favors and I really wanted Kleancolor. Now I&#x27;m stuck with this generic brand. I thought it would be okay to swallow my pride, but I really believe I got ripped off. It&#x27;s a good thing none of the attendees are polish mavens or it would be really be embarrassing to pass on this generic polish to lacquer connoisseurs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned, you get what you pay for. Cheap price for cheap brand.</li>
    <li> I was really skeptical but everything that I recieved was great! The nail polish remover pads work amazingly and the polish is very good! I only had one bottle leak but it was messy at all! I&#x27;m really happy that I bought this and I WILL RECOMMEND TO MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY!</li>
    <li> will order again! comoletely in lobe with them. no complsints whst so ever!</li>
    <li> I was really scared after reading the reviews of this product since people were receiving duplicates of colors in the set.  I am proud to say that I have zero duplicates!  The shades are a little green heavy, but that is okay.  I got chunky holo Bluebell, and a lot of other glitters that weren&#x27;t just you run of the mill glitters.  No, these are GLAM!  I&#x27;m so excited to use every color in this set.</li>
    <li> Cute color I dont Like some of the colors double lares dont always work so go buy white to help the color shine</li>
    <li> The colors are all darling! But the nail polish does not last very long at all... It flakes off just after a day or two. Worth the price just expect to paint your nails very often! :)</li>
    <li> (Written by girlfriend) Tons of colors. Zero duplicates. No broken bottles. Some were thicker, so they were perfect for stamping. Quick shipping! Overall pleasant experience.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t like the packaging of this item, though it was well organized and well wrapped, one of the nail polishes was open, and it got spilled on the others. the nail polish was as displayed in the picture on the website. thought there are a lot of colors, most of them are colors that can&#x27;t be used, or shades that are not cute at all. the density of liquid is so light. u have to put many levels on your nail so the color will appear.I think they aren&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what kind of nail polish I like so I bought this product.I thought Wow!!! these are cheap compared to other nail polishes.All of them rounding up to 1$ and 3 free nail polish removers.When it finally arrived I opened the package really fast because I was waiting for such a long time.I didn&#x27;t expect it,neatly rapped in little 7 tiny boxes each one with 6 nail polishes each in them.I was really glad that all of them didn&#x27;t break or crack along the ride,but what surprised me the most was the nail polish remover&#x27;s were not what&#x27;s on the screen they say Klean color wizard pads nail polish remover + cuticle oil,I mean they work great and all but I don&#x27;t like surprises when it comes to ordering something.They might have sold out on the nail polish remover so they bought new nail polish removers.I think they should at least somehow change the picture so you would expect what you ordered,and not to mention the packaging.I think the some of the nail polish&#x27;s have different amount of nail polish in them,like I got this peaceful heart nail polish,and it had less nail polish liquid than the others,but other  than that I&#x27;m happy with my order.If you don&#x27;t know what kind of nail polish colors you want then I say go for sets like this one.</li>
    <li> I love my nail polish, and when they arrived they were packed properly. Only thing is my nail polish peeled off of my toe nails; I am not sure what that was about.</li>
    <li> Some colors are pretty but I think they would be better&lt;br /&gt;Worn by a little kid because I didn&#x27;t like them so much</li>
    <li> For the price you pay, these polish colors and quality are awesome! I got an amazing selection and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> So many colors and styles of polish. I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll need any more polish for my life lol. So many kinds of polish. Lots of colors and a lot of glittery kinds.  IT was so fun going through them all.  The quality of polish is pretty good, too. It&#x27;s not too thick or thin and fun to try to pair a solid with a glitter polish. The picture is a combo of a solid and glitter. I loved it!</li>
    <li> happy with my purchase i needed more color options, and i have long nails so i needed alot of full bottles</li>
    <li> Let me first by saying I am extremely pleased with the timing it arrived to my house. It was estimated to be the at the earliest June 6th. I got it today after ordering it Friday! ithe packaging was the perfect size for the box... none were broken and they were all nice and neat. Their colors are awesome! No doubles either! The colors were grest too... everything from brown to barbie pink.... glitter to holo! I have nothing negative to say! It is a great buy all the way around! I couldn&#x27;t believe people gave it a bad review. I found the smell to be better than a lot of the more expensive polishes I have in my collection... and the drying time is the same as any other normal (not 60 second drying) polish.  I have recommended this set to a couple friends now. I will be coming back for more!</li>
    <li> WOW!! What a GREAT deal on QUALITY nail polish! So many of my female family members wear nail polish that I was able to get 10 gifts from this, when accompanied by some other nail care items!!</li>
    <li> I had a credit I bought these with, otherwise I would have been super disappointed.  The glitters aren&#x27;t great.  Some are better than others.  Most of the polish only stays on a day or two.  Although even expensive polish doesn&#x27;t stay on my nails well.  It would be decent for someone young who&#x27;s just into having fun with nails and doesn&#x27;t care if it starts chipping off in the middle of a workday.</li>
    <li> I love KleanColor and it&#x27;s one of my favorite brands. I got an assortment of beautiful colors and a matte! I can&#x27;t wait to get painting! Fast shipping, every bottle was individually wrapped, and I had no breaks or spills. I&#x27;m super excited!</li>
    <li> this is great my cousin got this and told me bought it and she did my nails and i loved it even though i havent bought it for myself i will! i love doing my nails by myself im 13 and its a perfect price for me! i can actually aford it and its super cute! thx for the precautions of wapping it and ill buy this for myself!</li>
    <li> I ordered this nail polish set in hopes to get my 3 scented nail polish remover but instead I got a pack of eyebrow shapers...</li>
    <li> Though the colors are very pretty and unique the quality of the polish is terrible. Even with a UV gel top coat it comes off the next day, it starts chipping without any reason. I&#x27;ve never had nail polish that lasted so little! Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> First of all, for a set of 48 polishes in normal sized bottles, 42$ is a good price...the only bad thing is you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re gonna get in the box. i messaged the seller to see if she would skip out on the yellows but of course no answer and i got the yellows anyways lol...no big deal the big set i got is worth the 2 extra nail polishes that i&#x27;ll never use....and then i came across a bottle of brown. who even uses brown nail polish?! why even put that in the box! i dont want it! haha im throwing that one away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a couple of the polishes were open which is no big deal because it didnt make a mess or waste the polish it was just around the bottle and caused it to stick to the wrapping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in the end i got lots of glitters, sparkles, and beautiful neon and pastel colors.&lt;br /&gt;i got one of each, purple, pink blue green and orange yellow neon-like colors, sparkly chunks one in each color and i even got black and white, a clear coat, and this gorgeous holo purple that looks like you are staring into a galaxy or something. its awesome. this set is awesome i am pleased!I also don&#x27;t think i will ever have to buy nail polish again...but i probably will anyways because im a woman LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i definetely reccomend this product, it is a great deal and the colors are amazing.</li>
    <li> I was really pleased with how fast this order came! I did have one bottle completely explode and cause a big mess, so I wish the packaging was a little better to protect the bottles. Other than the 1 that broke, I LOVE all the colors. I didn&#x27;t get any duplicates and I&#x27;m really pleased with the choices. I love all the glitter polishes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the brushes are good and they cover really well. The colors are fast drying and last easily a week without chips. These polishes smell worse than any other brand I&#x27;ve ever used, but the smell goes away pretty fast, so it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
    <li> this is great set and has soo many variety of colors you cant and wont get bored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there were no duplicates and came in nice and secure packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love the solid colors and the glitter colors that it comes with. i brought s clear bin from walmart and set them in there and it looks great like i have a lot of nail polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the cons about these nail polishes and not sure if its only me, but they take a very long time to dry. i use two coats and they take a very long time to air dry i have to use a blowdryer to dry them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the variety of them are great and its a great way to start your nail polish collection set. the nail polish remover included works good takes a little force to take nail polish off but it smells good and very convenient</li>
    <li> Item was not as advertised.  The nail polish remover was not included.  Also there were several duplicates and ALOT of green.  More like reject colors than ones anyone would use.  What a shame, it was going to be a gift.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as part of a Christmas gift.  The product arrived in a sturdy shipping box.  Inside the shipping box were 8 boxes containing 6 nail polishes in each box.  Very well shipped.  The colors did not disappoint; they were very vibrant.  I tested one of the nail polishes and it went on smooth and the color looked great.  Very impressed.</li>
    <li> Very good&lt;br /&gt;I got more than what I had expected&lt;br /&gt;Delivered in time.&lt;br /&gt;It could also be a nice choice to gift some one :-)</li>
    <li> Really happy, came as described. Really happy with the variety of colors, there are just so many of the. Best gift ever.</li>
    <li> Great value. They need approx 15 mins to dry though. The packaging was wonderful and none of the bottles were broken.</li>
    <li> I received my nail polish and love every single one! Was well worth a 1.00$ a piece And would buy again in the future !</li>
    <li> some of these clear glitter ones take forever to dry if ever at all.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my friend as a set for christmas and she fell in love with every color. She mixes and matches and has a different set of colors every other week!</li>
    <li> I love every one of them.  I am very satisfied with my purchace.  Thank u.  I like too paint 4 nails one color and the ring fingers a different color.</li>
    <li> Love the variety of colors...my package arrive nicely and I did not receive duplicate colors. Love them and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors, the girls love it.  Lots of selection and shades of various colors.I w ould recommend for young girls</li>
    <li> the polish is really thick does not polish smooth so when you polish your nails they dont look good at all</li>
    <li> The bottles were all packed beautifully and were secure-- no broken bottles or leakage. I like all the metallics especially and thought there was a nice range of color types. Some of the glitter polishes did not show up on nail like it does in the bottle, but that is expected with any glitter polish. I did receive one repeat color, which means I am technically missing one is 50 bottles :/ idk all the color numbers they should come with however, so there is no way to write and get that fixed. Overall, I would definitely recommend! :)</li>
