### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It works great, but made my brown hair look grayish where ever I applied it!</li>
      <li>Oscar Blandi does Kelly Ripa&#x27;s hair, so I hoped this would be top-notch.</li>
      <li>A great  product for women with hair that gets oily every day.  </li>
      <li>I tried and liked both products, but neither product was perfect.  </li>
      <li>I have found it best to not apply it to the top layer of hair to hide any lightening.  </li>
      <li>Oscar Blandi is good and has a grown up smell.</li>
      <li>Perfect and well worth the price.</li>
      <li>A friend turned me on to this product and I love it!</li>
      <li>This product would be great for anyone with light hair.</li>
      <li>It smells great and makes my hair look fantastic.</li>
      <li>I am absolutely thrilled with this product.  </li>
      <li>This product has a nice scent and follows through with it&#x27;s claims.  </li>
      <li>The smell is kind of chemical like something you&#x27;d smell at a hospital.</li>
      <li>Yes it smelled nice,</li>
      <li>But I have to say that instead of being greasy my hair took on more of a nice sheen than greasy look.</li>
      <li>It has a very nice, sweet lemon scent that I find refreshing...</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair</li>
      <li>I used it this morning for the first time and I am definitely happy with it.  </li>
      <li>it probably would have been better</li>
      <li>It performs ok, getting rid of excess oil and adding volume</li>
      <li>After I used this product, it didn&#x27;t look or feel oily any more.  </li>
      <li>both worked...but the price of the Batiste is a much better deal (no need to spend more if you don&#x27;t need to).</li>
      <li>the \\&quot;refreshing lemon-verbena\\&quot; as they advertise it.</li>
      <li>plus, if you&#x27;re using baby powder, you SMELL like baby powder (and most people will know why).  </li>
      <li>Way better than I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure if I applied more</li>
      <li>Make sure you rub it into your scalp</li>
      <li>if very fine and gets oily very quickly...</li>
      <li>Those bristles really distribute the powder and give hair nice shine and bounce!  </li>
      <li>This dry shampoo is the best I have ever used and lightyears ahead of baby powder.  </li>
      <li>However it does smell wonderful, doesn&#x27;t take away your natural shine and is much lighter than baby powder.</li>
      <li>If you need more, repeat those steps until your hair looks clean again.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just that strong.</li>
      <li>The texture of the fine powder,</li>
      <li>Like many others here, I&#x27;ve tried baby powder on those too-late-to-shower panicky mornings, and was pretty pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s especially good if you just have a little bit of build-up or oil at the roots.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely a great way to get an extra day out of your hair.  </li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll get a power residue in your fingernails, but besides that - it&#x27;s just fabulous.</li>
      <li>it makes it look light, airy, smooth and shiny without the grease.</li>
      <li>I love it, because it really does soak up the grease; I have no problem going four or more days between shampoos.</li>
      <li>I prefer the Blandi much more than the Klorane (and far more than Pssst).</li>
      <li>it keeps your hair looking clean alll day...</li>
      <li>I used another brand of spray dry shampoo that worked great but was discontinued.</li>
      <li>It will turn your hair a bit white if you apply directly to the scalp, this method of application gives the best results.  </li>
      <li>The scent is more grown-up smelling than baby powder and is very faint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Let it sit for a minute or two while you brush your teeth, then  (this is a key) brush it out with a good quality brush, like boars hair.  </li>
      <li>Blandi does a more thorough cleaning job, smells better (pleasantly lemony), is gentler on my scalp, makes my (wavy) hair fluffy, and keeps my hair cleaner for a much longer time.    </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pregnant with superhuman senses.  </li>
      <li>But it does the trick, it has a mild smell, like lemons that lasts for about and hour after you put it on.</li>
      <li>I use it as a quick pick-up if I&#x27;m running out the door.</li>
      <li>This was probably because both product suggest that a natural bristle brush be used after apply, and using this kind of brush on my fine hair really doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>is leave out the cheap lemon scent - stick to just verbena or offer another scent - and the product would be flying off the shelf, even at a higher price.</li>
      <li>My all time favorite new beauty find.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m still on the first bottle!  </li>
      <li>The powder is fine-textured, smells nice, and is WHITE.</li>
      <li>This stuff is definately worth a trial run at the $10.00/bottle cost.</li>
      <li>I did that three times, and I think it distributes the powder better through my hair than if I had just put it directly on my head from the bottle as the package suggests.  </li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  </li>
      <li>Just make sure that you smooth this through your hair very well or it will leave a bit of a white cast.</li>
      <li>And I kind of find that the slight residue continues to absorb oil through the day, allowing you to brush &amp; clean more later.     </li>
      <li>I like the smell, very fresh and clean, and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look white like baby powder.  </li>
      <li>plan on using this for many hurried mornings in the future!  </li>
      <li>sure you spread it out, and do not apply to the same spot over and over.  </li>
      <li>I for one would definitely give it another shot if I heard that they&#x27;ve changed the scent, or also offer a better smelling version.</li>
      <li>and it really works!</li>
      <li>The first few minutes while applying you can still smell the verbena (which is actually a very nice smell) struggling to cover the horrendous lemon-scented-chlorine-bleach \\&quot;note\\&quot; that completely overpowers the formula, and</li>
      <li>and I ordered it because of the positive reviews.  </li>
      <li>Nothing beats a bona fide wet shampoo, but to make color last, to save time, and to avoid the dreaded oily hair smell and look, this stuff fits the bill very nicely.</li>
      <li>However, since two weeks after a visit to my hairdresser, my roots are grey, I can&#x27;t say that is a problem :).  </li>
      <li>I sprinkle some along my hairline around my face if my hair is looking a little greasy or if I didn&#x27;t have time to take a shower (this is the BEST product to use if you are camping for a few days).</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t really work for my hair either</li>
      <li>I think that they may have used too much of the product.  </li>
      <li>This revives my hair if it has too much product build-up.</li>
      <li>This product really says what it does.</li>
      <li>i hadn&#x27;t taken a shower yet, so i went straight up to my room and followed the instructions.</li>
      <li>But, I do use it if I have to just very sparingly</li>
      <li>I really like the smell, too...</li>
      <li>As a brunette, I&#x27;ve always had issues when I&#x27;ve tried to use baby powder to absorb excess oil and product in my hair, because it&#x27;s very visible.  </li>
      <li>It also adds volume but not too much.</li>
      <li>It may be good for people with light colored hair, but for dark colored hair it simply falls short.</li>
      <li>Since my stylist recommended that I wash my hair every other day, I&#x27;ll now be able to without feeling like a greaseball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>how easy it&#x27;s to apply, how fluffy it makes the hair with very little product needed, and it even works agains dandruff - all its good points...</li>
      <li>this product is awesome for days when you are running a little late and don&#x27;t have time to wash and restyle.</li>
      <li>I was also really pleased with how little of this product is necessary to make my hair feel clean and refreshed...</li>
      <li>i recomend this highly...</li>
      <li>I like being able to squeeze a little on my hand and apply to the hair that way too.  </li>
      <li>It was totally worth it, and I plan on using it regularly!</li>
      <li>mother says this product is nothing new, but I didn&#x27;t know about it.</li>
      <li>So I went off in search of a new brand.</li>
      <li>I have fine dark hair.</li>
      <li>and I was pleasantly surprised how easily it was to get off of my black pants when I spilled some</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much too noticeable in my black hair, doesn&#x27;t comb out completely and left a huge amount of residue.</li>
      <li>&quot; a little in your palm or fingers, dust your fingertips in the powder, then lightly rub/</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t stink and look like an old gray mare.</li>
      <li>I was very self-conscious all day when I used it and even had a friend wander if I&#x27;ve been mopping my floor recently!</li>
      <li>This can easily be fixed by brushing or smoothing your hair.</li>
      <li>This product is my first try at a dry shampoo</li>
      <li>I just had to jump in the shower to wash the dry shampoo out, which more or less negates its purpose.</li>
      <li>If you wash your hair every other day, and want that fresh feeling and look, I recommend it.</li>
      <li>but my hair looked no less oily then before.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I never used dry shampoo before, so I bought the \\&quot;tropical Batiste Spray\\&quot; ($6) and \\&quot;Oscar blandi Pronto powder\\&quot; ($11) dry shampoo.  My hair would become greasy about 5 hours after washing it, so I wanted something to use while at work about halfway between my shift.  I tried and liked both products, but neither product was perfect.  I have very fine hair and when I applied either product my hair would become staticky. This was probably because both product suggest that a natural bristle brush be used after apply, and using this kind of brush on my fine hair really doesn&#x27;t work.  But I have to say that instead of being greasy my hair took on more of a nice sheen than greasy look. I would definitly recommend either product..both worked...but the price of the Batiste is a much better deal (no need to spend more if you don&#x27;t need to).</li>
    <li> I agree that it&#x27;s not much different from using baby powder and really expensive. There is not much in the 2.5 oz bottle and the cost is a whopping $20! However it does smell wonderful, doesn&#x27;t take away your natural shine and is much lighter than baby powder. In times of desperation - if you sleep in on weekdays, are too lazy to wash your hair or like me, have thin hair and can&#x27;t wash it every day, it&#x27;s a quick solution.</li>
    <li> I like to wash my hair every fourth day, if I can.  Other then at the scalp, which is a greasy mess by day 3, my hair usually looks better a few days out.  Enter Oscar Blandi Dry Shampoo.  I love it, because it really does soak up the grease; I have no problem going four or more days between shampoos. The only thing is, I really hate the smell; another problem is that it makes this brunette&#x27;s roots look grey.  However, since two weeks after a visit to my hairdresser, my roots are grey, I can&#x27;t say that is a problem :).  I recommend it</li>
    <li> This product would be great for anyone with light hair. The powder is fine-textured, smells nice, and is WHITE. It works great, but made my brown hair look grayish where ever I applied it!</li>
    <li> I really liked the scent of this product but based on the other reviews I&#x27;ve read, either you love it or hate it.  I have really thick, wavy dark brown hair.  I used it twice and both times someone commented on the white flakes in my hair (embarrassing!)  It didn&#x27;t really work for my hair either but it may be because I have such thick hair.  But I won&#x27;t be using this product again.</li>
    <li> I carry this little bottle in my purse. I sprinkle some along my hairline around my face if my hair is looking a little greasy or if I didn&#x27;t have time to take a shower (this is the BEST product to use if you are camping for a few days). It smells great and makes my hair look fantastic. I work it in to my scalp with my fingers. It also adds volume but not too much. Instead of my hair looking greasy, limp, heavy and flat it makes it look light, airy, smooth and shiny without the grease. My all time favorite new beauty find.</li>
    <li> I tried this brand because the Klorane was out-of-stock and Oscar Blandi does Kelly Ripa&#x27;s hair, so I hoped this would be top-notch. What a disappointment! The high alcohol content left my hair smelling like a hospital lab, in addition to it looking dry &amp; frizzed. Hey, I can get my hair to look like that all by myself! I don&#x27;t need to spend money to get there. Thankfully, Klorane is back in stock.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely thrilled with this product.  As a brunette, I&#x27;ve always had issues when I&#x27;ve tried to use baby powder to absorb excess oil and product in my hair, because it&#x27;s very visible.  Oscar Blandi&#x27;s Pronto Dry Shampoo also made my hair feel much silkier than baby powder ever has, and it&#x27;s completely  invisible.  It has a very nice, sweet lemon scent that I find refreshing...plus, if you&#x27;re using baby powder, you SMELL like baby powder (and most people will know why).  I was also really pleased with how little of this product is necessary to make my hair feel clean and refreshed...and I was pleasantly surprised how easily it was to get off of my black pants when I spilled some (that can be a nightmare with other powder products).  I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  It was totally worth it, and I plan on using it regularly!</li>
    <li> A friend turned me on to this product and I love it! I have a dry, itchy scalp and my hair gets greasy if I wash every day, but looks awful if I don&#x27;t wash it - so this powder revamps my hair - makes it look and smell clean (like lemon baking powder) and it works for days. Way better than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you itch your head you&#x27;ll get a power residue in your fingernails, but besides that - it&#x27;s just fabulous. Make sure you rub it into your scalp so you don&#x27;t have powder on your part. And don&#x27;t get it on your clothes -fix hair before getting dressed. AND DON&#x27;T PUT ON HAIR IF WET! It coagulates and gets clumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother says this product is nothing new, but I didn&#x27;t know about it. Hope it helps you guys as well!</li>
    <li> This revives my hair if it has too much product build-up. I use it as a quick pick-up if I&#x27;m running out the door. I definitely recommend this. It&#x27;s especially good if you just have a little bit of build-up or oil at the roots. Just shake a little bit of product into your hands, then rub your hands into your hair. It has a lemony-scent to it and it does come out as a white powder. Just make sure that you smooth this through your hair very well or it will leave a bit of a white cast. This can easily be fixed by brushing or smoothing your hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered Blandi and the Klorane dry shampoo spray to help preserve the color in my hair. I prefer the Blandi much more than the Klorane (and far more than Pssst). Blandi does a more thorough cleaning job, smells better (pleasantly lemony), is gentler on my scalp, makes my (wavy) hair fluffy, and keeps my hair cleaner for a much longer time.    Blandi is a super-fine rice powder product that you apply close to the roots, rub around then brush out. So, regardless of how much you brush, you are going to have some small powdery residue, but its perceivable only by you. And I kind of find that the slight residue continues to absorb oil through the day, allowing you to brush &amp; clean more later.     Nothing beats a bona fide wet shampoo, but to make color last, to save time, and to avoid the dreaded oily hair smell and look, this stuff fits the bill very nicely. There&#x27;s enough product in the bottle to last a few weeks of consistent use, too.</li>
    <li> i tried this product as soon as ups dropped it off. i hadn&#x27;t taken a shower yet, so i went straight up to my room and followed the instructions. my hair is usually VERY greasy after sleeping on it, but it took very little product to give it volume and totally eliminate the oil from the roots. it left no residue, but as i said, i used very little because thats all i needed for the product to work. it does smell a little chemical-y, but no worse than after you get a dye job. this product is awesome for days when you are running a little late and don&#x27;t have time to wash and restyle.</li>
    <li> I just had to jump in the shower to wash the dry shampoo out, which more or less negates its purpose. I have dark red hair, and it made me look as though I was going grey at the roots. Even though I used a very small amount, no amount of brushing improved the look. Plus, it smells like flea dip! Gross.</li>
    <li> I picked this up in the small size at my local Sephora.  I am trying to switch to washing my hair every other day as opposed to every day.  This product has a nice scent and follows through with it&#x27;s claims.  It will turn your hair a bit white if you apply directly to the scalp, this method of application gives the best results.  I have found it best to not apply it to the top layer of hair to hide any lightening.  I have also found that about 20min after I apply there is no more white look.  I like being able to squeeze a little on my hand and apply to the hair that way too.  It does not seem to absorb the oil for as long, but still does the trick.  I would recommend to a friend and will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product back in September and have used it 2-3 times a week since and there is still over half the bottle left.  I like the smell, very fresh and clean, and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look white like baby powder.  A great  product for women with hair that gets oily every day.  Perfect and well worth the price.</li>
    <li> This product is my first try at a dry shampoo and I ordered it because of the positive reviews.  I used it this morning for the first time and I am definitely happy with it.  I have dark reddish brown hair and it tends to be oily by my scalp when I don&#x27;t wash it every day.  After I used this product, it didn&#x27;t look or feel oily any more.  I ran my flat iron through my hair and was on my way.  My hair is shiny and it has body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some comments that people had about the overpowering scent and the white residue.  I think that they may have used too much of the product.  A little goes a long way!  I just put a little powder in the palm of my hand, rubbed my hands together and then ran them through my hair, starting at the roots.  I did that three times, and I think it distributes the powder better through my hair than if I had just put it directly on my head from the bottle as the package suggests.  As I said, my hair is dark and there was no white residue.  The scent is more grown-up smelling than baby powder and is very faint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on using this for many hurried mornings in the future!  It&#x27;s definitely a great way to get an extra day out of your hair.  Since my stylist recommended that I wash my hair every other day, I&#x27;ll now be able to without feeling like a greaseball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***- It&#x27;s been 3 years of using this every other day and I&#x27;m still on the first bottle!  If you&#x27;re hesitating on making the purchase because of the price, keep in mind that the bottle lasts a very very long time!</li>
    <li> Like many others here, I&#x27;ve tried baby powder on those too-late-to-shower panicky mornings, and was pretty pleased with this product. I have dark brown hair and have found the trick is to distribute the powder by rubbing it directly onto my hair with my fingers (don&#x27;t use the applicator and get it on your scalp if you have dark hair or you&#x27;ll have a white part in your dark hair).  Let it sit for a minute or two while you brush your teeth, then  (this is a key) brush it out with a good quality brush, like boars hair.  Those bristles really distribute the powder and give hair nice shine and bounce!  This is the only way it works for me, but it definitely does work and is worth a try if you are on the fence about trying a dry shampoo. I really like the smell, too...</li>
    <li> The difference between the Oscar Blandi product and regular baby powder is the talc which you don&#x27;t want on your scalp.  This product fluffs your hair unlike baby powder and I have used both quite a bit.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> It performs ok, getting rid of excess oil and adding volume but it totally takes away my hair&#x27;s shine making it dull and powdery looking. I agree with the reviewer that said it makes her hair look gray at the roots (and I&#x27;m blonde). I also don&#x27;t like the scent and it sticks around ALL DAY. The smell is kind of chemical like something you&#x27;d smell at a hospital. But, I do use it if I have to just very sparingly so I don&#x27;t stink and look like an old gray mare.</li>
    <li> I happen to disagree with the other reviews as I have used both this product and (in times of desperation) baby powder. Oscar Blandi is good and has a grown up smell. It is much easier to comb thru your hair and does not leave a white residue or the powdery mess that baby powder is sure to leave behind. I have tried Bumble and Bumble which is JUNK and I have tried PSSST (whoa, what a stink). This stuff is definately worth a trial run at the $10.00/bottle cost. I have oily hair that turns dry when washed too much and this product has helped me balance both. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo is the best I have ever used and lightyears ahead of baby powder.  However, it is a little hard to get it completely worked into my hair.  People who know I use it comment on the slight grey sheen it leaves behind, but quite frankly, I don&#x27;t think anyone can see it unless it&#x27;s pointed out to them.</li>
    <li> I have dark hair with highlights, and wanted to find a product that would allow me to skip washing my hair every day.  This is it.  It&#x27;s no miracle (my hair still doesn&#x27;t always look its best when I haven&#x27;t shampooed and blow dried), but it does keep my hair from looking greasy or dirty when I don&#x27;t wash.  I&#x27;ve had my bottle for about nine months and still have about a quarter of the product left.  Look forward to trying the spray version.</li>
    <li> my hair if very fine and gets oily very quickly... usually i have to wash it every night so its not nasty looking the next day... but now i use this dry shampoo everyother day and it really works! it keeps your hair looking clean alll day... the smell isnt bad and it wears off after a little bit if it is too strong for you...i recomend this highly...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read the majority of the not-so-great reviews and I&#x27;ve seen a lot of complaints about the powder leaving white residue.  If used properly, this dry shampoo is a dream!  My friend brought this on a weekend stay and raved about it, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  My hair was TWO days old, and seriously needed a wash.  My hair is fine, dark brown, and medium-long (it falls about a half-inch above my back bra strap).  It is a bit oily after 24hrs of washing and needless to say, pretty gross after 48hrs.  My friend has thick hair and thinks mine is also thick (thanks to a little product).  She advised me not to be afraid to use a lot, so I guess she uses a good amount, however I only needed a little bit.  When applying, DO NOT APPLY TO YOUR SCALP!  I did brush my hair BEFORE using Oscar Blandi, it might have helped.  \\&quot;Squirt\\&quot; a little in your palm or fingers, dust your fingertips in the powder, then lightly rub/shake your roots while pulling the powder through your hair - make sure you spread it out, and do not apply to the same spot over and over.  Dry Shampoo obviously does not spread and lather like regular shampoo.  If you need more, repeat those steps until your hair looks clean again.  Just use a little bit at a time - there&#x27;s no use in loading up at once b/c it&#x27;s nearly impossible to dilute the amount of product you put in your hair (this is pretty much a universal rule).    I read a lot of complaints about the smell, but I didn&#x27;t notice anything and I&#x27;m pregnant with superhuman senses.  I got a lot a compliments on my hair that day!  My husband was shocked at how fast I got ready and my hair wasn&#x27;t just tossed in a ponytail.  It looked like I just washed and blow dried my hair - in a matter of 5 minutes.  Can&#x27;t beat that!!</li>
    <li> I have fine dark hair. I wash every other day but those inbetween days my hair gets oily only at the crown. I used another brand of spray dry shampoo that worked great but was discontinued. So I went off in search of a new brand. I gave this a try and let me just say, it&#x27;s NOT good for dark hair. When applied directly to my hair, and I used a tiny, tiny bit, the crown of my head turned white. Hair &amp; scalp... so I set to work massaging, rubbing, brushing, etc and it finally went away but my hair looked no less oily then before. I&#x27;m sure if I applied more it probably would have been better but then I would have been stuck with white hair. I did as one reviewer had commented which was to apply the powder to my hand, rub my 2 hands together &amp; then work into my hair. This provided a solution to no white in my hair but again, no change in the appearance of my hair. I&#x27;ve since found another spray dry shampoo and think I will stick with that &amp; away from the powders!</li>
    <li> is the smell!!! The texture of the fine powder, how easy it&#x27;s to apply, how fluffy it makes the hair with very little product needed, and it even works agains dandruff - all its good points... And then there&#x27;s that smell!... the \\&quot;refreshing lemon-verbena\\&quot; as they advertise it. The first few minutes while applying you can still smell the verbena (which is actually a very nice smell) struggling to cover the horrendous lemon-scented-chlorine-bleach \\&quot;note\\&quot; that completely overpowers the formula, and you and everybody else on the same block as you will be smelling it all they long - the \\&quot;lemon\\&quot; scent doesn&#x27;t really go away. I was very self-conscious all day when I used it and even had a friend wander if I&#x27;ve been mopping my floor recently! There&#x27;s nowhere you can go to get away from it and it also won&#x27;t be coverd-up with a perfume - it&#x27;s just that strong. All in all, what a waste! All Mr. Blandi&#x27;s team needs to do here is leave out the cheap lemon scent - stick to just verbena or offer another scent - and the product would be flying off the shelf, even at a higher price. I for one would definitely give it another shot if I heard that they&#x27;ve changed the scent, or also offer a better smelling version.</li>
    <li> Bought this product after reading rave reviews and reading about it in a couple of magazines. It&#x27;s much too noticeable in my black hair, doesn&#x27;t comb out completely and left a huge amount of residue. Yes it smelled nice, yes it soaked up the grease but I still couldn&#x27;t wear my hair down because my scalp looked completely white and it would not go away no matter how much I brushed it. It may be good for people with light colored hair, but for dark colored hair it simply falls short.</li>
    <li> This product really says what it does. If you wash your hair every other day, and want that fresh feeling and look, I recommend it. You cant compare it to how your hair feels when you just step out of the shower. But it does the trick, it has a mild smell, like lemons that lasts for about and hour after you put it on. But it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. If your looking for a substitute for washing your hair everyday, try this.</li>
