      <li>It makes my boyfriend happy as well</li>
      <li>This set is great and the colors are nice and everything.  </li>
      <li>Since I do my nails myself and cannot do them perfectly like the salons, imperfect lines don&#x27;t show as much.</li>
      <li>I have been doing my own gel manicures for over a year now and have had no issues with any like this one.</li>
      <li>This is great because it creates natural, beautiful looking nails.</li>
      <li>and i am so glad that i found it alot cheaper than at my own supplier.</li>
      <li>Got this for a gift, I am sure they liked it.</li>
      <li>Love shellac.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I have been so into gel nail for so many years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>(all most all the brands that you can find in retail store or on amazon).  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love the shellac polish.</li>
      <li>fans~  :)</li>
      <li>But so far, CND Shellac is the best brand among all those brands with reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>The white tips are great because it hides grease and dirt</li>
      <li>I also bought a brush just for French tips and it works great.  </li>
      <li>overall, a great product.  </li>
      <li>have tried so many brands and because my love to gel nail, I even learned to do it on my own.&lt;br /&gt;The best brand I tried is Calgel (but it&#x27;s freaking expensive and I couldn&#x27;t get that because I don&#x27;t have the manicure</li>
      <li>I get under my nails when working (Yes, I clean my nails,</li>
      <li>good quality that last</li>
      <li>First use stayed on 3 weeks!</li>
      <li>look great for at least 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>(he&#x27;s the one who gave me a gift card to get my nails done in the first place).&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I want to love it especially with the price</li>
      <li>Base and top coats are perfect!!</li>
      <li>The base and top coat are wonderful!</li>
      <li>so I still get a positive use out of them.</li>
      <li>Worked just fine with a cheapo 36w uv lamp.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped faster than what it said (arrived like 3 days earlier)</li>
      <li>Had to remove it because it had grown out so much.</li>
      <li>So being a big do-it-yourself person, decided to order the polish and UV light setup and do my own.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and i do really like this product</li>
      <li>Original product arrives really fast, the color is sheer, and that picture is for two coats.</li>
      <li>So, I love it a lot and recommend this brand to all the other gel nail</li>
      <li>Shellec is better than any other gel polish out there.</li>
      <li>White color is a bit thick but the rest is just awesome.... will buy definitely again when run out!!</li>
      <li>Purchased this to do a French manicure and have done it a couple of times now and still having issues making it last more than a couple of days.</li>
      <li>Both due a nice job as a french manicure</li>
      <li>The other had a more natural look.</li>
      <li>It takes about 10-15min for both if you cut it short have fun filling the color.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>easily comes off if you 1) soak your nails in warm acetone (double bowl: lower hot water and smaller bowl placed inside with acetone) or 2) foil wrapping (cotton with a little acetone applied to nail and then finger tip gets wrapped in a little foil).</li>
      <li>First time buying this specific brand</li>
      <li>I had my first manicure a couple months ago using shellac, and liked it a lot, but it&#x27;s so EXPENSIVE.</li>
      <li>I really like the Studio White because it is not stark white.  </li>
      <li>but sometimes it&#x27;s not easy getting them completely clean).</li>
      <li>so easy to use lasts at least 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The pink Beau color adds just a slight shimmery pink, healthy look.</li>
      <li>It dries very smooth and is less &amp;#34;bubbly&amp;#34; than gel, and it&#x27;s also easier to remove and does the least amount of damage to your nails, compared to acrylic.</li>

<li> Works well and lasts a long time.  </li>
<li> So when I received this one I was a little surprised that this one came with the Beau color as my 1st one came with the Clearly Pink color.</li>

<li> You also need one of those little brushes to use with the white</li>

<li> Other than that</li>
<li> was a little dissapointed in the pink color</li>
<li> I will say however trying to give yourself a french manicure is really hard.  </li>
<li> The difference would be hard to tell if I had not used them both at the same time, one on each hand to compare.</li>
<li> but i have tried the base and top coats</li>
<li> it was a little to sparkly for my liking, however when I used 1 coat</li>
<li> and i am not easy on my nails.  </li>
<li> In my opinion, too expensive to do on a regular basis.</li>
<li> is a bit hard so thank you for the pricing.</li>
<li> was shocked how easly it came off with no damage to the nail.&lt;br /&gt;Looked</li>
<li> The bottom line, no matter which one you get you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <li> This set is great and the colors are nice and everything.  I will say however trying to give yourself a french manicure is really hard.  You also need one of those little brushes to use with the white so you can brush off the excess white.  Other than that it&#x27;s a great kit.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the shellac polish. (UV lamp needed to cure). Shellec is better than any other gel polish out there. It dries very smooth and is less &amp;#34;bubbly&amp;#34; than gel, and it&#x27;s also easier to remove and does the least amount of damage to your nails, compared to acrylic.</li>
    <li> The base and top coat are wonderful! (Especially when they are used with the USpicy LED/UV lamp.) It is a no brainier to but this item when you are going to do at home gels (or salon) because it helps your polish and gels since you basically putting a second nail on.&lt;br /&gt;It easily comes off if you 1) soak your nails in warm acetone (double bowl: lower hot water and smaller bowl placed inside with acetone) or 2) foil wrapping (cotton with a little acetone applied to nail and then finger tip gets wrapped in a little foil). It takes about 10-15min for both if you cut it short have fun filling the color.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are really put to better use as a base color in my opinion so I still get a positive use out of them.</li>
    <li> Original product arrives really fast, the color is sheer, and that picture is for two coats. Worked just fine with a cheapo 36w uv lamp.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped faster than what it said (arrived like 3 days earlier)</li>
    <li> Works well and lasts a long time.  I can get three weeks out of a manicure even doing yard work.</li>
    <li> Got this for a gift, I am sure they liked it.</li>
    <li> I have been so into gel nail for so many years.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried so many brands and because my love to gel nail, I even learned to do it on my own.&lt;br /&gt;The best brand I tried is Calgel (but it&#x27;s freaking expensive and I couldn&#x27;t get that because I don&#x27;t have the manicure license).&lt;br /&gt;So, I tried ibt, Gelish, OPI, and some other brands sold at CVS (all most all the brands that you can find in retail store or on amazon).  But so far, CND Shellac is the best brand among all those brands with reasonable price.  So, I love it a lot and recommend this brand to all the other gel nail fans~  :)</li>
    <li> This kit is awesome.  I also bought a brush just for French tips and it works great.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> White color is a bit thick but the rest is just awesome.... will buy definitely again when run out!! Base and top coats are perfect!!</li>
    <li> I had my first manicure a couple months ago using shellac, and liked it a lot, but it&#x27;s so EXPENSIVE. In my opinion, too expensive to do on a regular basis. So being a big do-it-yourself person, decided to order the polish and UV light setup and do my own.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never done, or had interest in doing my nails. I&#x27;m a big tom boy; I work with my hands a lot in mechanics, chemicals, dirt ect. I&#x27;m regularly chipping and breaking my nails. Throw polish on them? What&#x27;s the point?&lt;br /&gt;Not this stuff. It lasts and even makes my nails stronger.&lt;br /&gt;I chose the French manicure, because I&#x27;m just not the type to have my nails painted with color. This is great because it creates natural, beautiful looking nails. The pink Beau color adds just a slight shimmery pink, healthy look. The white tips are great because it hides grease and dirt I get under my nails when working (Yes, I clean my nails, but sometimes it&#x27;s not easy getting them completely clean). I actually feel \\&quot;girly\\&quot;. It makes my boyfriend happy as well (he&#x27;s the one who gave me a gift card to get my nails done in the first place).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with my \\&quot;new\\&quot; nails.</li>
    <li> All cnd products perform well .Nails look great for at least 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> i havent tried the french manicure out yet but i have tried the base and top coats and i do really like this product and i am so glad that i found it alot cheaper than at my own supplier. i have a salon and i dont do alot of manicures so spending a ton of money is a bit hard so thank you for the pricing.</li>
    <li> Purchased this to do a French manicure and have done it a couple of times now and still having issues making it last more than a couple of days. I have been doing my own gel manicures for over a year now and have had no issues with any like this one. First time buying this specific brand and I want to love it especially with the price but just can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> overall, a great product.  good quality that last</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd french manicure set that I ordered. The 1st was ordered from a different vendor. So when I received this one I was a little surprised that this one came with the Beau color as my 1st one came with the Clearly Pink color. Well I took this as an oppertunity to compare the two. Both due a nice job as a french manicure but I personally prefer the clearly pink as the nail bed had a slightly healthier youthful look to it. The other had a more natural look. The difference would be hard to tell if I had not used them both at the same time, one on each hand to compare. The bottom line, no matter which one you get you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality product</li>
    <li> Love shellac. First use stayed on 3 weeks! Each  since has been 2-3 weeks and i am not easy on my nails.  Had to remove it because it had grown out so much.</li>
    <li> so easy to use lasts at least 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;I was a little dissapointed in the pink color it was a little to sparkly for my liking, however when I used 1 coat it was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked how easly it came off with no damage to the nail.&lt;br /&gt;Looked totally proffesional.m looking forward to saving tons of money doing it myself</li>
    <li> This is my second ordering of this set.  I don&#x27;t use anything else. I really like the Studio White because it is not stark white.  Since I do my nails myself and cannot do them perfectly like the salons, imperfect lines don&#x27;t show as much.</li>
