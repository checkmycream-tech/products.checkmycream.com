    <li> Very good product. Recommended to me by my pedicurist.</li>
    <li> I have been using Varisi for about  6 months .   It appears to be working, but it is a slow process.      Carl N</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 10 years. It has kept my nails strong and nice looking. I have also given this product as gifts.  I would recommend that everyone give it  a try.</li>
    <li> Varisi works miraclously!! I travelled with it in my purse and drip on my toe everytime I remembered it. My toenail returned to normal within 3 month!!! I gave the balance to someone who was having similar toenail issue and it&#x27;s working just the same.This is a must have for all tail techs to introduce to their clients.</li>
    <li> I have successfully used Healthy Nails for a long time.  When I ordered the product on Amazon I received a different package (rectangular and labeled &#x27;Healthier Nails&#x27;) and formula.  When I contacted the seller, I was told that they had changed the package and formula and it should work the same.  I see the old package on Amazon so I&#x27;m not sure I received the correct product.  I have not had enough time to evaluate the effectiveness of the new formula product compared to what I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> delivered fast.  our patients get good results using this product.  we order it on a regular basis for our patients&#x27; needs.</li>
    <li> I have had a problem with fungus  on my second toe nail for years.I have tried almost everything on the market, nothing worked. One day I was getting my pedicure, the Salonist recomnended Healthly Nails, said it really works! I bought one from her that day and continue to use it daily. I buy it now at Amazon.com it is much cheaper to keep a supply on hand. I have been a customer of this product for over a yr.  It works as long as you use it twice daily!    Twinkel toes, Betty</li>
    <li> Great product that works, handles all kings of nail fungus even if you wear tips.  It is one of the few products that does what it promises. Highly recommended, even just for maintianing helay nails.  I have been using this prodiuct now for about 3 years.</li>
    <li> my nails are destroyed from psoriasis and arthritis.  i used this twice per day  for about 3 months&lt;br /&gt;and am seeing nice new growth .  when i ran out of my original bottle i got busy and found some&lt;br /&gt;more to keep heallthy looking nails.  it is absolutely the best.  varisi does just what i was wanting&lt;br /&gt;it to do.  thanks for good pricing as well.</li>
    <li> Vanisi was dispatched quickly, arrived on or before time. At this point have not been able to judge the effect of this product as it needs to be used for several months before results can be produced, but am sure due my research that this product will be effective.</li>
    <li> This is great to KEEP your nails from ever getting an infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this nail product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it regularly on hands and feet and have very healthy nails.</li>
    <li> It works well but you need to be consistent using it twice a day, and be ready for it to take awhile.  Great price compared to retail stores.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product! When used consistently this product is very effective. I have recommended this product for years to my clients with nail bed problems.</li>
    <li> Good!&lt;br /&gt;I hope it help my nails healthier.</li>
    <li> When used as instructed, this works pretty well in keeping my affected toenail in pretty decent shape.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it &amp;#34;cures&amp;#34; anything.  Once I stop using it, the fungus, or whatever it is I have, comes back.  At least it is much better while using this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of products including ones prescribed by a doctor and nothing worked. Varisi Healthy Nails has changed all that. You do have to be diligent and apply it twice a day, but if you do that, you will see an improvement. My nail salon recommended it to me and I go to her every six weeks. Since I have been using this she has been able to clean all that ugly tissue out from under my nails. It doesn&#x27;t happen overnight (I have been using it a year and my problem is almost gone). Also, it does turn your nails dark, but the end result is worth it. I keep nail polish on my nails and you can&#x27;t even see that they are dark. I guess this might be a problem for men, but, believe me, the end result will be much healthier nails.</li>
    <li> My nail lady sold this to me for $10 a bottle.  Then I found the exact thing on amazon for much cheaper.  Works very well.</li>
    <li> Does a great job clearing up nail fungus. Recommended to me by my manicurist. I use it twice a day to keep my nail fungus free.</li>
