<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It really ain&#x27;t Done nothing it has glitter to make it look good. And smell good but it really Done nothing..</li>
    <li> I just finished my first bottle and wish I would have measured beforehand to know actual results :( I use it twice a day and pretty sure it is working! I will very likely keep using this as directed well into the summer months. I am pretty small; just trying to firm up some areas after my last child. Great product!</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait a good week before rating and all I have to say is... Wow. I do not expect miracles but in my very first application, I could see that the smaller dimples disappeared almost instantly (yes, the larger indents are still there but I&#x27;m only a week in). It tingles nice n cool after application for a good 10 minutes which I find very appealing! Makes my skin super soft! Can&#x27;t wait to see further results. :)</li>
    <li> I am totally in love with this product. I&#x27;ve been an athlete for 15 years and have always had problem with cellulite&#x27;s on the back part of my thighs as well as loose skin in the abdominal area. After just 1 week of using this product I can see great improvements. I definitely recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> Ive been using this product for about a week now and I can tell a difference in the amount of dimples on my legs! And the cooling effect is actually nice after a good workout</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. The cooling effect feels great on my skin and after only a few days, I can tell it is really working!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  You can really feel it get to work!  I&#x27;m hooked and convinced!</li>
    <li> Day 3 and loving this stuff.  I do notice a slight change but not 100 percent.  But just the soft skin alone has me wanting to keep wearing it.  It&#x27;s gonna go quick so try and use sparingly.  I&#x27;m def gonna look into the other lotions to pair it up.</li>
    <li> It was okay, nice cool sensation. I bought this for my butt and thighs. I would combine this with some squats and other leg and butt exercises. So I&#x27;m not sure which did more work, but I have a slight difference only half way through my first bottle.</li>
    <li> i had my husband purchase this for me and it works great! I&#x27;ve also used other products from this same brand so i knew it would be good. of course at first i only used it like every other day since i didn&#x27;t have time but i would still notice a slight difference in my skin appearance so i knew it would work the more i used it. I intend on buying more in the near future since its good for all over the body problem areas :)</li>
    <li> this is a wonderful product.  works great for me,</li>
    <li> Not sure if this thing even worked.  Didn&#x27;t see difference on my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve Been using this product and i can really see  results on the abdomen. I will keep using it. After all, why use a regular body lotion when you can use this one and get some extra benefits?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the product. This is my 3rd one already &amp; has helped shaped my midsection with a waist trainer, staying active &amp; eating healthy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 months and other than smelling like bengay, i don&#x27;t really notice any difference, and proof it does what is says or even implies, tried several different types of this product from this manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product! It really does work its magic but the best part for me is the cooling sensation. I love it! I do not regret buying it</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I have been using this company product off and on for about 3 years now.  Out of all the other 5 that I&#x27;ve tired, this one is the most the effective. I have lost 3 inches in 30 days from my waist. My husband was asking my if I lost weight and I told him &amp;#34; no...I lost inches in my midsection&amp;#34;. I also have been getting asked this question a lot. I will be getting another tube in the near future.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I loved it, it improves the look of cellulite and tightens the skin. Best on the market!</li>
    <li> I wish I could get my money back :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this product, but it really didn&#x27;t show any sign of improvement.</li>
    <li> This product is the best! After using it one time I could actually feel the tingling sensation on the areas that I applied it to. This not only works on the slimming process but when applied leave an attractive glitter on the skin that causes you to sparkle in the areas you have applied the product to.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I wish more people gave it lower stars aka the number of stars it deserved before I bought it.  Its horrible.  Didn&#x27;t work.  Didn&#x27;t do a thing but made my skin smoother. But every single dimple remains right where it left off.  At one point I thought I had more when I started using the product. I would give zero stars but it couldn&#x27;t technologically been done.</li>
    <li> NOTHING EXTRAORDINARY AS I EXPECTED</li>
    <li> Minty but no difference</li>
    <li> Love the entire line! Used daily and it will make a difference! Got my sister and mom hooked on it now! Deffinately will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I use other products from this line and also like this one. It&#x27;s thicker and a larger bottle. Doesn&#x27;t seem to have as much of the cooling effect but seems to last longer on my skin.</li>
    <li> Refreshing minty smell and tingly feeling when applied.</li>
    <li> It really firmed up my tummy and I lost an inch I also wore a waist trainer which HELPED so much</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing just make sure you massage it in! Once you get to where you want to be you can go down to once a day and it will still maintain your results!</li>
    <li> I have been rubbing this on my belly for 5 weeks it have not done anything for me</li>
    <li> It really works!! Lost one full size using this, not even every day.</li>
    <li> Excellent smell and feel. I&#x27;m still not done with the tube and lost an inch. I combine this one with slim extreme 4D in the green tube. During my workout I use it with a sweat belt.</li>
    <li> This stuff is THE TRUTH! I work out and I have been struggling to tone up my dimply tummy and buttocks with exercise and diet alone and this product is aiding me in doing so and rather quickly I might add! I purchased this a couple of weeks ago, and let me be honest, I don&#x27;t use it religiously but when I do, I can see the difference afterwards, and you feel it too, it cools you down and then it tingles to no end, it was a bit too intense the first time I used it, but once I got used to it, it has been amazing! I&#x27;ve been trying to lose baby weight from 3 back to back pregnancies and this has me on my way buy it folks you won&#x27;t be disappointed! &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> I like this lotion. It absorbs into the skin nicely and leaves a little sparkle. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I&#x27;m not sure if it did anything about the cellulite, but I&#x27;m kind of old so nothing really helps. My dermatologist did say my skin is very hydrated though.</li>
    <li> I want some more of this it real works</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! It definitely works for me tightening and toning my skin. I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product, my legs are looking better than ever. I exercise and use this cream and together I am seeing great improvement.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well ! Has a nice cooling effect.</li>
    <li> Amazing !! Really  tighted my skin up, id recommend it to everyone</li>
    <li> The cooling effect of this is amazing! It makes your skin have a cool tingle. A huge plus is that it makes your skin sparkle! This stuff also smells really good a lot better than other things I have tried.</li>
    <li> I do not think this product helped me all that much. It could just be me and not using it properly. I will keep trying it though</li>
    <li> I love this creamy, silky, glittering lotion. It feels so good. With a fresh clean scent. I will use this product forever.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. After a month of the recommended use, I see such a drastic difference. My problematic areas have become firmer and much smoother. Amazing results at such a low cost compared to higher end products. I am also currently using Eveline Push-Up. It does wonders on the derriere! It&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
    <li> This product MAY work for getting rid of cellulite, but its hard for me to notice if it does. What it does do is make your skin feel like someones running ice cubes all over it! This would be good for a prank or if you have hot flashes maybe. Again, not really sure if it works for cellulite because I have so little to begin with, but this definitely has a very potent chilling effect!</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product by using it two times a day like required you will see a different I have been using it for one week an I have notice a different in my stomach area</li>
    <li> I can tell a little difference on my tummy (my trouble spot). I don&#x27;t apply it consistently but when I do I can tell my stretch marks are smoother. Thumbs up!  Gave a 4 bc I havent gotten to see the best results.</li>
    <li> So I have been using this product for two weeks and I have to tell you honestly it is the best product that I have come across. I bought it just to see if it worked as I had seen great reviews from people on here but I had to see for myself. I am so happy that I did...just after the second application I could already see results...my tummy had pretty bad stretch marks from where I had gotten pregnant in 2011 and I have tried everything on the market and nothing worked. This stuff has changed the look of my stomach so much... The stretch marks are now fading and becoming less defined ... I love this product so much that I recommened it to a few of my model friends and all of my sisters too! Thank you so much</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking it would slim down the cellulite. It did not work. It was fairly inexpensive so I was not out a whole lot of money. I don&#x27;t recommend it to others, because it did not do as it stated.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference. Sorry, I won&#x27;t be buying these types of products again. I was looking for better (or something) results than nothing at all.</li>
    <li> Great slimming serum, I been using it for three days now. My stomach has gotten flatter, I will keep using and have recommended to family.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of this product, but it&#x27;s worth a buy!&lt;br /&gt;I bought it because I needed something to help firm and tone my belly.&lt;br /&gt;I applied it and wear it with my waist trainer every day. So far, I am getting mild results.&lt;br /&gt;But I did see a difference in my tummy. My stretch marks are fading. And my love handles did shrink a little.&lt;br /&gt;So far, I am pleased.</li>
    <li> Simply love all Evelin&#x27;s anti cellulite gels. They help excrete excessive water from my legs after long day. I don&#x27;t have problems  with restless legs and cellulite any more thanks to Evelin&#x27;s gels.</li>
    <li> I prefer the 3d extreme much more.  The Butt Booster is awesome &amp; worked quick for me.</li>
    <li> It seems to be working</li>
    <li> Fast delivery &amp; great price for this product.</li>
    <li> It Works Well For Me. I&#x27;ve Noticed A Difference In My Stomach Within Two Weeks. I Would Definitely Purchase Again. I Need To Get My Body Together For The SummerðŸ‘™</li>
    <li> This Slim Extreme is great quality and even have nice color :) very good! I like the sparkling stuff in it and fresh smell. My skin is getting smoother day by day. This Polish brand rocks!</li>
