      <li>Kind of fun!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice smell that sticks around all day but doesn&#x27;t smell super &amp;#34;perfume-y&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Excellent for anyone with dry skin.</li>
      <li>It gives your skin a wonderful, warm glow and its light and not too heavy.</li>
      <li>The shimmer is caused by mica particles (it&#x27;s a type of rocklike mineral), and according to the Environmental Working Group it&#x27;s pretty safe [...]    </li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>You might like it if you like the beautiful shimmer and can get away with less lotion</li>

      <li>I like this lotion very much.</li>

      <li>I love the light feeling and you have a little glow with it.</li>
      <li>Leaves a pretty sheen (slightly sparkly in the light) that looks nice with short sleeves or tank tops.</li>

      <li>Maybe I&#x27;m applying too much.</li>
      <li>You skin feel very silky.  </li>
      <li>, the thinness is very likely what makes it absorb so quickly.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ve never had a problem with any other type of lotion, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of the cheap ones.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s enough for me to buy it again for the shimmery purpose, but I might buy it again just because it&#x27;s a nice body lotion.</li>
      <li>As it is, I can see it, in direct sunlight, because I&#x27;m looking for it.</li>
      <li>It gives my old skin some sparkle.  </li>
      <li>I have incredibly sensitive skin</li>
      <li>The product has leaked outside the tube a few times and collected around the neck as well, even if I securely close the lid.</li>
      <li>Overall too much shimmer, mess and hassle for me.</li>

<li> Seriously, the smell lasts all day on my skin.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t shout, hey look at me but is somewhat demure and subtle.  </li>
<li> Since the lotion is so thin, it leaks out and collects around the mouth.</li>
<li> The lotion is thin and a bit runny.  </li>
<li> and this is a thin lotion, so I have to.</li>
<li> Very subtle reflective qualities, I like it.</li>
<li> Overall terrible experience with this product.</li>

    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.. Just stayed on my skin and didn&#x27;t sink in... Was not moisturized.</li>
    <li> Very subtle reflective qualities, I like it.</li>
    <li> Lotion caused an allergic reaction. Never had problems with any other lotions.</li>
    <li> Use just a dab every day on my face... works great... not oily.</li>
    <li> I love this!  It makes me feel so smooth and soft and I love the subdued sparkle from the mica.  It doesn&#x27;t shout, hey look at me but is somewhat demure and subtle.  It looks great when it catches sunlight.</li>
    <li> I love the light feeling and you have a little glow with it. You skin feel very silky.  You will love it!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent for anyone with dry skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this lotion. It gives your skin a wonderful, warm glow and its light and not too heavy. It has a plain scent, but its natural so its not overpowering! I recommend!</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is my all time favorite lotion.  I have incredibly sensitive skin and this is the only stuff that doesn&#x27;t make me itch or break out.  I like the radiance lotions,because they add a little ground mica to the lotion and it makes you sparkle.  Kind of fun!</li>
    <li> Its a nice lotion, not too strongly scented and I like the shimmer :)</li>
    <li> Love it. .not the smell when you first put it on but it goes away.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff but for me its going to be more of a summer lotion when I go out and want that extra glow.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  It gives my old skin some sparkle.  I can&#x27;t say it improves the quality of my skin but that is probably my fault from years of sun.</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m applying too much. I have dry skin and this is a thin lotion, so I have to. It was too glittery for me, and stuck to my hands even after rinsing. I kept getting it on my face by mistake.    The shimmer is caused by mica particles (it&#x27;s a type of rocklike mineral), and according to the Environmental Working Group it&#x27;s pretty safe [...]    The tube is pretty problematic. Since the lotion is so thin, it leaks out and collects around the mouth. The product has leaked outside the tube a few times and collected around the neck as well, even if I securely close the lid. You might want to store the tube upside down.    Overall too much shimmer, mess and hassle for me. You might like it if you like the beautiful shimmer and can get away with less lotion (I admit, the shimmer is pretty. I just don&#x27;t have the patience to dilute it by mixing it into another lotion, etc. etc.).</li>
    <li> Love, love, love the smell. It&#x27;s a nice smell that sticks around all day but doesn&#x27;t smell super &amp;#34;perfume-y&amp;#34;. Love the shimmer it gives too. Seriously, the smell lasts all day on my skin.</li>
    <li> Always buy this brand because it is pure and does not have chemicals in it. I like how the minerals leave a sparkly glow on my skin too.</li>
    <li> I like this lotion very much. It smells good, lotions on very easily. I use it on my legs and arms. Would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is ok. Nothing special.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a slight bit of reflection on my legs during summer.  It provides all you need there without it being glitter.  The lotion is thin and a bit runny.  This suits me because I dislike heavy lotion in the hot southern sun, but I can see it would be a problem for those with dry skin.  Absorbs well.  I only use it when I am going to an event and want a little polish.  Be sure to wash your hands to keep from transferring to clothing.</li>
    <li> I should have listened to other reviewed, product is very thin and shimmer is barely noticeable.  I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Leaves a pretty sheen (slightly sparkly in the light) that looks nice with short sleeves or tank tops. Has a light, pleasant smell. (I don&#x27;t like heavy or floral scents, but this is very subtle.)  Doesn&#x27;t moisturize quite as well as their regular creams, but still nice.

I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s enough for me to buy it again for the shimmery purpose, but I might buy it again just because it&#x27;s a nice body lotion.</li>
    <li> gives my skin a nice glowy look, smells nice and its not greasy. I buy whenever I run out.</li>
    <li> My 2nd tube!&lt;br /&gt;shimmery --my kids tease me that I&#x27;m a sparkly vampire.  Spreads evenly, smells great, hydrates well &amp; looks great on tan legs!</li>
    <li> The smell was great but I had an allergic reaction to this lotion and it caused hives all over my body, I&#x27;ve never had a problem with any other type of lotion, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of the cheap ones.  Also there&#x27;s glitter inside, I don&#x27;t think they advertise that enough. Overall terrible experience with this product.</li>
