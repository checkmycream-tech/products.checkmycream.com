      <li>I gave it two stars as the consistency was good , went on smoothly.</li>
      <li>The coverage is far from perfect.</li>
      <li>I have been using this concealer for 3+ years now (...slightly attached) and I won&#x27;t stop until a better product comes my way.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m trying to love the stuff</li>

      <li>I found that the product works better when you apply it with your ring finger and blend it with a beauty blender.</li>
      <li>You get a generous jar for the price and #2 worked ok on my olive skin.</li>
      <li>The price is fabulous!  </li>
      <li>If it is too orange for you, you will have to layer another skin-toned concealer or foundation on top.</li>
      <li>I dont think yhat most products (if any. .</li>
      <li>Applying a lot made it look unnatural and made lines appear more pronounced.</li>
      <li>Would buy again :)</li>
      <li>then something like the MAC concealers is probably a better choice.</li>
      <li>I am also using Neutrogena healthy lengths mascara (doesn&#x27;t smear).</li>
      <li>Besides, I cut ties with two sociopaths (my uncle and my auntie), and I feel like I finally can look my best.</li>
      <li>If it is too orange for you, you will have to layer another skin-toned concealer or foundation on top.</li>
      <li>However, I would appreciate it if was more hydrating.</li>

      <li>Easily goes on with a makeup brush or finger tips.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s my absolute favorite, but it goes on easy &amp; has nice coverage.  </li>
      <li>The texture is not tacky and is easily applied.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s now 6 hours since I put it on and still going strong with no touch ups.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wonderful product! Works very well, but need a little used to apply it right amount. It&#x27;s seems like take care of skin also.Pretty impressive! I get # 2 .</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t cover much for me....I have an olive complexion.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products in search for the one concealer that will work for me. I have finally found it. I have been cursed with allergies and poor sleep because of allergies. So the raccoon eyes really shows. This concealer seriously works. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin like many I have tried. The area around my eyes actually feel hydrated. It doesn&#x27;t irritate me when my eyes are itchy. A major plus. Instructions says it an be applied as a second skin. I found that I don&#x27;t even need a foundation.One layer of Salmon Dark Circle Concealer and  the Salmon Brightening Eye Cream and that&#x27;s it that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> they were great product did not preform to me. but i have really dark circles so cant blame them the search goes on but there service was great</li>
    <li> From reading reviews on both shades of this product, I feared that this might be too light...it was the perfect shade of salmon to help hide my dark circles!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had terrible dark circles so I&#x27;ve tried my fair share of concealers! I thought I didn&#x27;t have much to lose so I purchased this, and I definitely don&#x27;t have any regrets! It blends flawlessly and lightens up dark circles brilliantly. Would buy again :)</li>
    <li> Worked great! I was surprised at how little of the product I needed to use to get results. I&#x27;ve been trying other regular concealers and other undereye concealers to try to neutralize and hide my undereye circles, and none have had the outcome that this has. I didn&#x27;t even need to add any of my regular concealer over this. Was very creamy and smooth. It&#x27;s my new go-to undereye concealer!</li>
    <li> Not for really dark circles. Mine are hereditary and it didn&#x27;t cover very well. Applying a lot made it look unnatural and made lines appear more pronounced. Will still look for something to cover these, but I think it&#x27;s futile.</li>
    <li> Great quality-does not smell odd smells like silky lotion! Long Lasting :)</li>
    <li> It was a good product but just did not agree with the shade of my skin.Probably would work well for someone else.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Skin Foods products. Great concealer for a great price. Hides my dark circles perfectly. I set it with powder and it still creases though, but what concealer doesn&#x27;t crease? Love it nonetheless!</li>
    <li> I have tried everything I could find for dark eye circles.  Nothing helps.  I have recently figured out that this isnt discoloration but deep tear duct troughs making shadows that appear to be dark circles.  This skinfood product is really great at fixing the discoloration, which, it claims and believe it or not, helps to diminish the look of the tear duct trough ...a bonus.  I dont think yhat most products (if any. . without injections) could help this problem completely but the creaminess and blendability of this product definitely helps.  I am planning on buying again and DO recommend it to others!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to love the stuff but I kind of find it kind of dry and I don&#x27;t see any difference</li>
    <li> I love Skin Food products! My skin in generally sensitive to most makeup and being half asian I have these notorious dark circles under my eyes that I could never find any American brands that would help with the color. This product applies easily and the color matches my skin tone perfectly (I have olive skin)</li>
    <li> As good or better than the Bare Minerals concealer I was using, which is basically the only produce that covers my dark eye circles.  I would note that you won&#x27;t get total coverage with really dark circles like mine, but it&#x27;s still better than all the other products I&#x27;ve tried.  I also use it as a concealer for spots on my face and it blends well for that purpose.  You get a generous jar for the price and #2 worked ok on my olive skin.</li>
    <li> Can I give a negative rating? Not a good product at all,  it&#x27;s not salmon colored at all.  The texture clogs your skin too much, it&#x27;s full of crap wax and a total waste of money!  This product does NOTHING for dark circles under your eyes. If you want to burn money, just pull it our of your pocket &amp; throw it into the nearest fire.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product. Thanks.. will buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> The product is not for my skin. It might work well in a ​different type of skin...plus I did not like the smell. :_:</li>
    <li> I got  Salmon concealer #1.&lt;br /&gt;I am so impressed with the way it works. Instructions say to apply your regular foundation and then cover it with concealer under eyes. I decided to try it out on my bare skin. I applied it under eye and at first the cream seemed to sit on the skin, but a minute later it sunk in seamlessly and made dark circles much lighter. And it matches the skin color (I bought number 1 by mistake and thought it may be too light for me, but it wasn&#x27;t) so well that on days I don&#x27;t feel like wearing heavy makeup and I skip foundations and powders, I use Salmon concealer in two layers under my eyes, and you can&#x27;t even see that I have anything on my face. It just makes my dark circles match with the rest of the skin color, I can&#x27;t imagine wearing any other concealer on my face in two layers, with nothing blending it in, and not even being able to detect it!&lt;br /&gt;And if you use it with foundation it really works like miracle and your under eye is the same color as the rest of your skin!&lt;br /&gt;I have to start paying closer attention to Skin Food products!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from dark circles all my life and am always on the lookout for a good concealer. My latest favorite is a stick concealer from NARS in Honey. I decided to give this one a try because I like Skinfood products and Korean cosmetics in general - they deliver on their promise. As far as concealing goes, this one does the trick. You only need a little bit and the coverage is best of any that I&#x27;ve tried. The color is a warm salmony orange which neutralizes the cool tint of the circles really well without being cakey. The only drawback I see is that there is too much sheen. This is due to the consistency needed to provide the coverage. I usually cover it up with a bit of powder or BB cream. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to give kudos to soulglamour from whom I&#x27;ve purchased a number of products. They always ship quickly and provide some nice samples of products I want to try.</li>
    <li> I had to guess what my color was and I was lucky to have guessed right. I like how it didn&#x27;t make my skin look fake with a brightening property that many others have and the formula isn&#x27;t drying on the eyes. I wish that the shipping for my other products were as fast as this one!</li>
    <li> If you have really really dark undereye circles like me, this will not do anything for you and you will be so dissapointed.  I found that I have to put a pink concealer on my black circles and then put a salmon concealer over it and it still isn&#x27;t where I want it to be.  So if you are looking for a miracle like I was, this isn&#x27;t it ladies...</li>
    <li> I wish I liked this product but I won&#x27;t be buying it again. I&#x27;m pretty pale and this was even too light for me. The worst thing is though that every time I wear this it causes the mascara on my lower lashes to smudge</li>
    <li> Works well at concealing circles. I have to wear powder over it  to blend as it is too light for my complexion.</li>
    <li> I have very dark circles, and it is hard to find something that stays on all day. This does and matches my skin very well! I definitely recommend this product to anyone who has dark circles!</li>
    <li> Again I just Love this stuff, I just recently discovered Skinfood Products and I can&#x27;t get enough of them.. I use this along with the BB cream #2 and the Peach Sake Finishing Powder and my Face looks great.. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I expected it to be light but it is not as salmon colored as I thought it would be. It was pretty pink but that may be because I am tanner and yellower. It is great at brightening my dark circles and using a skintone concealer over it eliminates the pinkish cast anyways. The worse part about this product is that it is easy to overapply and it looks cakey.  A solution is to use a brush, use less concealer, and apply eye cream before. However, I would appreciate it if was more hydrating. But all in all, given it&#x27;s price, it&#x27;s pretty good!</li>
    <li> I have rely bad panda eyes so this is really great! salmon toned concealers counteract blue/purplish tones under the eyes and this did just that. It has a dewy finish and may appear too shiny/dewsy/greasy so i have to set it to apply it before my foundation/bbcream. Thankfully it is not drying, seep into fine lines or anything like that.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with this product. It was worth the money spent and the product did not come damaged in any way or form. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This last me for a long time. totally worth the price and perfect for covering dark circles and pimples.</li>
    <li> I use it a lot and it does conceal my dark circles. The texture is not tacky and is easily applied.</li>
    <li> This is not a typical concealer as we understand, it is more like a color corrector since it has that salmon color to it. It brighten the dark eye circle very well and do not crease. I don&#x27;t expect it to have all the beneficial effect that it claims to have because after all it is just a makeup. So far, it does what a concealer should.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to people who have oily eye areas and very dark circles.</li>
    <li> Not as creamy as I expected and does not cover and moisturize like others I have tried.  However, the Salmon color is quite good,</li>
    <li> I was scared that the color wasn&#x27;t going to match my skin tone since you can&#x27;t really see the shade from the picture, but it blends in perfectly with my skin tone which is great since I only use under eye concealer on a daily basis. I think it would last all day if it&#x27;s set with some kind of powder foundation or translucent powder, but since I don&#x27;t use that it does fade away as the day progresses, which doesn&#x27;t bother me. It&#x27;s the best concealer I&#x27;ve used for dark circles. I&#x27;ve tried so many different ones that just lighten up the area, it doesn&#x27;t actually cover the darkness completely, but this one certainly does and the great thing about it is that a little goes a long way. I don&#x27;t use much at all, I just dab my finger in the tub lightly and that&#x27;s all I use for one eye. My eyes are darker than my face, eyelids included so I use it for my whole eye and it covers wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I just received my Skin Food salmon concealer #2. On first use, I have to say it delivers as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Asian with light/medium to medium skinned with yellow undertones. My eye area has always been a bit darker than the rest of my face but I never struggled with dark circles until after I had a baby--sleep deprivation. Yikes! My circles are greyish (like a mix of blue and brown) in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I went straight to the Nordstrom Armani counter and had them color match me for a concealer. A teeny tiny tube of yellow-based concealer that matched my skin and cost $40. The coverage was too light. And the yellow base made the grey circles lighter but still visibly grey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then late one sleepless night, I learned from watching YouTube make-up tutorials that I needed a orangey-peachy colored concealer to counter the dark circles. The guru recommended Eve Pearl salmon concealer. I was hesitant because that was more even expensive than the Armani one I just bought and it got very mixed reviews. Plus the palette came with two colors meant for custom blending. But I hate that kind of palette because I like to keep things simple. And I always end up liking one color more than the other and wind up wasting 50% of what&#x27;s in the package. Anyway, while researching Eve Pearl, the Skin Food salmon concealer popped up in the search and had amazing reviews. So that is how I came across this product. At only $13, practically drugstore prices, I was willing to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Slightly orangey/peachy. Enough to cover and counteract dark circles. Not so orange so you end up with a streak of orange under the eyes that will require a second layer of a more skin tone matching concealer. The #2 actually matched me perfectly and I can wear this product alone with nothing else if I wanted to. Remember I&#x27;m light/medium to medium skinned with yellow undertones. But because I have that Armani concealer already, I&#x27;m layering that one on top to brighten the eye area after I&#x27;ve concealed the dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;2. Silky, creamy, hydrating formula with dewy finish. Easily goes on with a makeup brush or finger tips. This has such a lovely texture and very dewy finish. I highly recommend letting the product warm up and sink in to the skin then setting with a sheer and very finely milled setting powder to set. If you don&#x27;t wait or apply anything too thick or too much (like a powder foundation or too much power) else you might get some minor clumping. It happened to me when I was testing it with all my other makeups and powders but it was nothing noticeable except up close or under magnifying mirror and bright lighting though. If you are leaving your skin natural, then you don&#x27;t have to set. But if the rest of your face has a satin or matte finish, you have to set this with powder or your under eye area will look shiny in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;3. Good coverage and buildable. On first application with my fingers I achieved medium to medium/full coverage. The formula is smooth enough that you can build on more coverage with more product.&lt;br /&gt;4. Long lasting. It&#x27;s now 6 hours since I put it on and still going strong with no touch ups. It looks even better now and more natural than when first applied but my circles are still completely covered. I have no doubt it will still look perfect when I get out of work in 3 hours. Surprising because the formula is so dewy. But it looks great still and I have no dryness under my eyes at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Not a neutral colored or multi-purpose concealer. This is not really a con but I thought I&#x27;d mention it anyway just in case. This is not a neutral colored concealer that is multipurpose. I think people who can get away with neutral concealers have very faint/light blemishes or circles and they don&#x27;t need full eradication of those blemishes. A neutral concealer will do the job \\&quot;good enough\\&quot; with just enough color correction and lightening for people with very minorblemishes and discoloration. For me, this is a very specific concealer for very specific uses. I will use it just for dark circles under the eyes. Because of the color, it is not for covering redness. I tried on some redness around my nose and this does not work for that. It will cover older acne scars that have faded to a greyish brown in color. It won&#x27;t cover anything that is pink or red. You&#x27;ll need a green tinted concealer for things like that. If it is too orange for you, you will have to layer another skin-toned concealer or foundation on top. Also, because the formula is dewy, it probably won&#x27;t be good for anywhere on the face other than under the eyes. Unless you have very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price and how much I&#x27;m liking it right now, this is a 4 or 4.5 star product for me. Hope this helps.

    <li> This product is amazing. I hesitated at first, but I read a review saying that it was better that the benefit concealer, totally true!!! I tossed my benefit concealer away. I have no more dark circles :), and I had those for years! I believe this is thank to this concealer + the fact that every night, I use queen bee cream on my eyes. I am also using Neutrogena healthy lengths mascara (doesn&#x27;t smear). Besides, I cut ties with two sociopaths (my uncle and my auntie), and I feel like I finally can look my best. I can&#x27;t believe it worked :).</li>
    <li> It is extremely smooth and does a great job in covering my hereditary dark circles.</li>
    <li> too glossy and by end of the day my eyes look  very ashy  and irritated ..doesn&#x27;t work for my medium brown skin tone.</li>
    <li> Love it. It&#x27;s creamy and apply smoothly under my eyes.  Gives me enough coverage I needed. Will buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> I bought this to compare to a similar product(benefit erase paste)This cream in a # 2 does a better job covering dark circles.I&#x27;m an med-olive or golden tan complexion.Blends in perfect,very creamy.Love the container too.l will be repurchasing it!</li>
    <li> I have tried hundreds of concealers in my lifetime and I must say, this one does not disappoint.  I like it.  Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s my absolute favorite, but it goes on easy &amp; has nice coverage.  The price is fabulous!  Try it, you really have nothing to lose except for a few bucks.</li>
    <li> I found this concealer to be wonderful for the under-eye area. It is creamy and light and for the first time ever I found a dark circle concealer that barely creases on me. However, this concealer is light-to medium coverage. If you have VERY dark circles under your eyes I don not recommend this concealer (this concealer would likely not cover the red or orange correcting products you would have to use under the concealer if you have very dark circles). I am very happy with this product! I have attached a photograph of the Skinfood concealer #2 as compared to two shades from the MAC Conceal and Correct Medium Palette. The swatch in the middle is MAC Mid Peach and the swatch closest to my knuckles is MAC NW 25 with the swatch closest to my wrist being the Skinfood #2 concealer. I think that Skinfood Concealer #2 is a combination of the two due to it&#x27;s slight peachy undertones. Compared to the MAC concealers it is much lighter which I like since I have a lot of creasing with the MAC concealers even using powder (or no powder). If you want something that is full coverage then something like the MAC concealers is probably a better choice.</li>
    <li> Have used many products to hide my dark circles, which are quite dark. This product delivers. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and am quite happy with it. I would give it 5 stars but it is just a tad greasy. Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> The coverage this concealer provides is great; however, it was just too shiny for me. Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin, but it didn&#x27;t work for me. I would have to use way too much powder to get rid of the shininess. I tried that and it ended up looking like a cakey, wrinkly mess.</li>
    <li> The concealer is really smooth and easy to apply. I would recommend using your fingers to apply rather than a brush. The color of the product is actually very light compared to my beige/tan Asian skin. It doesn&#x27;t bother me that much because it does blend well into your skin tone. It&#x27;s very dewy but will set into your skin after roughly 30 minutes or so. The concealer is not cakey and looks pretty natural. Although it does not cover red, dark spots, and dark scarring that well. You probably have to reapply after 4-5 hours.  *Warning* I was at an outdoors event and usually carry some makeup with me. I placed this concealer in my dark navy bag and it did melt, but formed back into its shape. (Although slightly tilted.) I wouldn&#x27;t recommend bringing this to apply during a hot summer day.  Overall it&#x27;s a good product and would definitely use it again to cover my dark circles!  2017 Update: I have been using this concealer for 3+ years now (...slightly attached) and I won&#x27;t stop until a better product comes my way. To make it clear, I just purchased my 4th bottle. This product can last anywhere from 8 months to a year depending on the amount you use.   I found that the product works better when you apply it with your ring finger and blend it with a beauty blender. To restate what was mention earlier: it does REDUCE the appearance of red spots, dark spots, and dark scarring with layering and blending. BUT do not depend on it for that because the concealer will not cover it 100% completely. It additionally has a dewy finish.  As for melting in the heat, DO IT! (lol) Since I use my ring finger to apply the concealer, it becomes difficult to get the product when it runs low. I tend to tip it on the side and leave it in my car to have it melt tilted on its side and reform. This makes it easier to use the concealer to its entirety.   I apply another layer on the days my dark circles are being vicious and also use powder foundation on top to seal in the deal. (This will help extend the coverage.) Therefore, my dark minions are covered with the proper techniques and this magical concealer.</li>
    <li> Color is more orange-ish than expected.  Did not work for me in covering blue-ish undereye circles.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this product by a daughter that lived in Japan and I shared the same comments she had. It worked beautifully!</li>
    <li> I do not know what happen to my first order? However, they send me another one to replace the one that was lost. I am so happy with the product. I wear alone with a little face power to smooth it evenly around my eye lids and under my eyes. It&#x27;s creamy but not greasy! I will buy another one! after I finish it! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I wish this was a little creamier but it covers well.</li>
    <li> Nice and creamy...does cover.  A little too light for my olive skin tone, so I use just in the corner of my eyes.</li>
    <li> it does its job at covering the imperfections but it still gave the racoon eye effect. maybe if bl;ended wit another product.</li>
    <li> Great concealer with good coverage.  A tiny bit goes a long way.  #2 color is good for darker skinned asians, olive complexions.</li>
    <li> I always get scared with creamy products but this takes a fairly long time to crease under my eyes. I do use an eyeshadow primer under my eyes to help though. Perfect color to block the veins under my eyes and is not too dark like other under eye concealer.</li>
    <li> best product for dark circles</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very creamy. Good for very dry under eye area. I cannot use it unless I set it with a powder. Color is nice and peachy and brightening.</li>
    <li> Easier than the dual color pad thingies I was using.  A few dots below the eyes, a quick pat down and out the door looking rested. Ya I&#x27;m a guy and I like how it makes me look better.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it as the concealer, too shinny and oily.</li>
    <li> I love this concealer, it&#x27;s easy to apply, moisturizing and easy to blend.  I purchase #2. It for darker skin tones. I use Mac n25.</li>
    <li> I read all the positive reviews and decided to purchase this product. It was creamy, but I didn&#x27;t really see any difference regarding my dark circles. I just need to keep searching.</li>
    <li> This as such a smooth application and covers with just two swipes of finger tips under the eyes. I do like this product for my dark circles a lot, but it does not give complete coverage, however I havent found one concealer that actually does. I do recommend this though, its a great concealer.</li>
    <li> Received melted but still useful.  I&#x27;m SE Asian and got the #2 and it matches pretty well.</li>
    <li> Good concealer. Better than erase paste and better for the eyes because of the fat from salmon. A little goes a long way. Does sort of smell weird but not in a bad way. It just doesn&#x27;t smell floral or what you would expect from a cosmetic cream. Oh yes, it&#x27;s creamy enough to spread and hard enough to stay put.</li>
    <li> Great product...much better than tons of expensive european and US brands. It really takes care of the under eye problems  plus it has a flawless application.</li>
    <li> not what I thought and goes on kinda of dry, not creamy</li>
    <li> This is a great product to use after you apply you eye cream or chemical peels.  It will last you 4 months maybe more. Enjoy this great product</li>
    <li> great concealer. I love this skin food brand name. Item came as described. i was scared that the color would be too light, i am a olive toned complexion but i blend it well and its great for my under eye circle. I recommend this brand name and product came as described. I enjoy make up from korea. The products usually are good quality and not as expensive as some of the higher end products you get at sephora.</li>
    <li> I like it and it also came with different samples of facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> Creased on me.... Not made for mature eyes</li>
    <li> I was looking for an orange concealer a little darker than my normal skintone to conceal my under eye circles, and unfortunately, this still appears lighter than my skintone when applied.  I like the texture, however, because it is very creamy and easy to apply.  A little goes a long way, so this jar will last me for months.  I will continue to use this as an eye brightener, because I do love the texture of it on my skin, and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t get caky throughout the day is a plus!</li>
    <li> The item shipped pretty quickly, I received it in just a few days. I have medium tan skin and I typically pick concealers that are a little bit lighter than my skin tone. I was a little nervous that it might be a bit too dark for my taste but I was blown away by how perfectly it matches my skin. If you have medium/tan skin, this will match you perfectly. The coverage is far from perfect. I was happy when I put this product on in the morning, but was disappointed around midday when it had worn off. So, if you have medium skin and are okay with constantly reapplying concealer you will love this product.</li>
    <li> I love this concealer! It&#x27;s so natural and it enhances your eyes to look awake and beautiful. Plus you don&#x27;t need much so there is a lot of product! I got the #2 color because I&#x27;m an Olive colored skin.</li>
    <li> This is, hands down, the BEST concealer I have ever used.  It goes on smooth, it melts into your skin and it&#x27;s buildable without looking cakey or flat-out unattractive(you know what I mean).  I&#x27;ve been using SF Salmon Dark Circle Concealer Cream for about three weeks now and I&#x27;m just loving the look it gives me at nearly 60.  I use a silicone primer all over my face then MAC foundation, while I brush on the SF concealer under my eyes I then move to the lids, just a little and I blend that with my BB sponge,  by the time that&#x27;s finished, the under eye area has nearly blended itself, I just tap lightly and I&#x27;m done.  Gone are the dark areas!  Mine are close to my nose, but those little puffy bags go all the way, I can hide those too! So, I&#x27;m in love, love, love with this concealer.  Not only is it a fantastic product(IMHO) you get A LOT of product for your dollar.  The pot is large and should last a year, when, whither it&#x27;s gone or not, you should replace it.  Mine came well packaged and FAST; I know we all love fast.  I only recently became associated with SkinFood products, but the love affair is growing by leaps and bounds, I am finding that SkinFood LOVES mature women&#x27;s faces, and I love that in a product.  But those reviews are elsewhere.  All in all, I would not hesitate to recommend this or any SkinFood product to anyone, including my 92 year old mother.  Buy with confidence and thanks for reading this. :-))</li>
    <li> It was too oily for my already oily skin. The color was nice I just wished stayed on longer. Tiny jar.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from dark circles my whole life. Nothing totally covers them up but this does camouflage them pretty well. I use just a little bit &amp; it melts into my skin. I set it with a matte bronzer powder afterwards.</li>
    <li> It was ok for covering my dark circles.  By mid-day, it had worn off.  So still determined to make it work, I tried putting more on the next day and used powder to set it.  It still didn&#x27;t cover too well</li>
    <li> Very thin and has zero coverage for my dark circles. However, I have recently started using a paste of fresh parsley and plain Greek yogurt and have seen a difference in the severity. I will continue this treatment..</li>
    <li> I have very dark circles and a medium brown complexion. All the other products I&#x27;ve tried had a pink color base. The #2 concealer cream has a tan/peach color base which does not give the appearance of reverse raccoon eyes when it is blended with foundation. Also, I have seen an improvement in the dark circles after a month of use. They are still dark, but not nearly as much as before. I use less of the product now than I did when I first started.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this. The pot of cream is so small, but lasted me over 3 years last time.  I wish they still offered the brightening eye powder too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;&#x27;s goes on smoothly, but it was too light.</li>
    <li> There are only two shades - I chose the darker one but light for my skin. The product itself is nice.</li>
    <li> I would put Skin Food Salmon Dark Circle Concealer Cream # 2 right up there was the best of them.  I bought it back in June 2013 and use it every day and I still have plenty left.  I have an olive complexion and it work great.</li>
    <li> This concealer looked darker in the jar but when I applied it, it looked much lighter with no visible salmon color effect to cancel out circles. My skin color is Mac NC 40 so for fairer complexions it&#x27;ll probably match well. I gave it two stars as the consistency was good , went on smoothly. However, it did give me that raccoon look that we all hate...</li>
    <li> shipment took long.price was too much for the size, its the size of the picture. only comes in 2 colors. and both the colors are nude. so it did not match my complexion. didnt work that great i gave it to a friend so i wasted 13 bucks on nothing. the only thing good i think about this product is that it may last you long if you dont wear lots of concealer and it covers good thats it.</li>
    <li> Blends right in!  It looked a little dark in the container, but it ends up matching my skin perfectly and brightens up my eyes without emphasizing wrinkles. It&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> This product brightens my eyes and works perfectly as an eyeshadow base. It has a very nice peach tone which I believe would go with any skin color.</li>
    <li> This product works good. I put it on before the cover-up.</li>
    <li> I am very allergic but this concealer is amazing for me! Perfect color, texture and coverage.</li>
    <li> I apply this under my eyes with a brush. Goes on creamy and covers well.</li>
    <li> This item works great for the price . I am very happy with it and think it is well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Pretty good product I use this after primer , covers a bit up but don&#x27;t expect this product to fully mask dark circles because it doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;I have to put boi-ing concealer over this to get a pretty good coverage for my dark circles, but overall if you are looking for a natural look with little to medium coverage this product is for you. btw the consistency is pretty creamy and easy to glide on under your eye.</li>
