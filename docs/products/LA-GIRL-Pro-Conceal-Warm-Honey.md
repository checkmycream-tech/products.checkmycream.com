<li> In store they go for no more than $2.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s so hard to find my color ...</li>
<li> I bought five of these and ALL the colors looked the same which was really disappointing.</li>
<li> I would recommend you shake them upon using because they seem to be water base.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great quality concealer with excellent coverage!</li>
    <li> I heard a lot of great review about this concealer and I must admit it definitely lives up to the hype. I goes on so smooth and covers really well. I definitely will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Works wonders hides marks blends colors and helps with scars acne whatever u have great for the face and finishes flawlessly</li>
    <li> I always read &amp; watch reviews before I make online purchases. I saw a couple of reviews on this concealer and I love it. I would recommend you shake them upon using because they seem to be water base. Overall, good product I love the highlighted effect it give me. I bought this product for a highlight.</li>
    <li> My undereye concealer is NW 40, and under my eyebrow I use NW 35. I am not a huge make up person and I am still learning how to apply everything. I like my minimal makeup to look natural. I&#x27;ve learned less is more (for me) when it comes to the LA Girl Pro Concealer. Also I ended up purchasing this one (warm honey) and cool tan because I wasn&#x27;t sure which color would work for me and I ended up needing to mix these colors to fit my skin. I&#x27;m still perfecting it that&#x27;s why I gave it 3 stars. At the end of the day I kinda like just using my NW 35 studios fix concealer as a highlighter because it doesn&#x27;t crease up on me and my skin likes it. Not that the LA Girl one creases cuz it doesn&#x27;t, I think my issue is perfecting the amount to use and the color. I&#x27;m still learning. SHIPPING WAS VERY FAST AND I WOULD BUY FROM THIS VENDOR!</li>
    <li> Loveeeeee it, the cheapest creastless concealer ever! I don&#x27;t even have to set it. Its amazing and blends like a dream!</li>
    <li> I bought five of these and ALL the colors looked the same which was really disappointing. Not sure if I am into the hype.</li>
    <li> Covers all my scars on my face I bought 2 I&#x27;m going to buy another I love it :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to get this product for awhile now because of all the rave on YouTube. I trust Amazon so I decided to buy of here, I decided to go with beautyjoint because of the price and feedback and I&#x27;m glad I did... I ordered this product on Jan 12 and received it on Jan 15 from CA and I live in Illinois, I LOVE to he service!!!! The product is a nice texture can&#x27;t wait to use it... I definitely will be restocking when needed from this seller and I would DEFINITELY Recommend this to any and everybody!</li>
    <li> love these concealers, they are my staple</li>
    <li> Concealer was good - but it&#x27;s not a lot of product. I will have to order more soon. It took 9 days to get to me. will purchase from diff seller next time</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! Some people think this is a full coverage concealer but it&#x27;s really not! Its more medium coverage but is definitely works well. Only thing about this concealer I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s oil based and so it does break me out if I use on my cheeks so I only use as a conceraler and highlight for under my eyes and T zone excluding cheeks so people with oily acne proned skin BEWARE!</li>
    <li> Great for highlighting under the eyes and t zone I love it</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful!</li>
    <li> its awesome for a highlight. I like it I pack it on under my eyes also to conceal my dark circles. its good for over all highlighting it works better than most expensive. concealers . but you can get it much cheaper on ikatehouse.com its only a 1.99 on there they rip you off a bit on here. enjoy dolls!</li>
    <li> I like!&lt;br /&gt;Even though it&#x27;s not my color I mix it with my maybelline instant age rewind concealer and it gives me the perfect color. Good consistency not to thick since it&#x27;s water base and medium to light coverage</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great doesn&#x27;t crease.I&#x27;m looking for heavier coverage for my under eye circles. Also the tube won&#x27;t last long using it everyday.</li>
    <li> the color shown is inaccurate, i got it and it was about three skin tones lighter than me, but it was ok because i was able to give it to my older sister that is lighter than me! no worries, just think the colors need to be more accurately shown!</li>
