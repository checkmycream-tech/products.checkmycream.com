      <li>/&gt;Hyaluronic acid’s biggest claim to fame is its ability to retain water, helping to create a firmer, more toned, and plump appearance to the skin.</li>

      <li>of the most skin damaging elements are UVB rays from the sun.</li>
      <li>received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.</li>
      <li>Healthy.  </li>
      <li>My skin is lovely.</li>
      <li>My Skin feels stronger but more supple and washes cleaner.</li>
      <li>I really love it.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>and I feel better about myself when I look in the mirror.  </li>
      <li>i enjoyed this one</li>
      <li>This is great way to find the ones i really like.</li>
      <li>The Bodi Skincare Hyaluronic Acid Serum is a pretty good product.</li>
      <li>I’m 53 with fair skin, and throughout my lifetime, I spent a great deal of time on the beach without sunscreen...</li>
      <li>The packaging is clean and very easy to use.</li>
      <li>It plumps fine to medium lines for sure.  </li>
      <li>Seems to work good, fast shipping</li>
      <li>While I have not noticed any significant benefits/changes to my skin, I am pleased that it does not bother it.</li>
      <li>The serum goes on easily</li>
      <li>First i would like to say i liked the bootle that this comes in.</li>
      <li>I also enjoy that it</li>
      <li>Bodi Skincare Hyaluronic Acid Serum has a light lavender scent, which helps aid in relaxation as well as to help improve your skin from the inside out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really enjoy trying out things for my face and see how they work.</li>
      <li>Overall this is a great product.</li>
      <li>but there is significant change in skin texture.</li>
      <li>Amazing job of smoothing out my 52 year old undereye wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>If I really want the smoothing effect, I forego moisturizer (which seems to dilute the efficacy somewhat) and just use a couple of pumps of Bodi - it is pretty amazing.</li>
      <li>I like that the bottle is transparent in the mid-section; it is easy to tell how much product remains.  </li>
      <li>I use this product for a month twice in a day, love how skin feels, soft and tight.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>In turn, it naturally minimizes the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought several products like this one because I wasn&#x27;t sure what would work and what would not.  </li>
      <li>I have not had any skin irritations (my face is very sensative!).</li>
      <li>I really like this product!</li>
      <li>I am also concerned about keeping my skin clean and clear of blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I like the neat , clean professional look.</li>
      <li>Seems to be working very well.  </li>
      <li>Apply 1 pump-ful of serum to fingertip, then, using pinky and ring fingers, gently pat and massage in around forehead, eyes and mouth.</li>
      <li>The bottle contains 1 oz or 30 ml, pretty normal for a serum.</li>
      <li>Lightly pat dry.</li>
      <li>Realistically, I don’t think any cream can reverse the ageing process on older skin once the wrinkles are there.  </li>
      <li>According to the label, this serum contains Vitamins C and E and Lavender Essential Oil, all powerful skin regenerating ingredients, and Aloe Vera and Witch Hazel, soothing and tightening.  </li>
      <li>But, hopefully, we can use creams to soften the appearance of those wrinkles and forestall the appearance of new ones.  </li>
      <li>It goes on very smooth and only need a little bit.</li>
      <li>makes the skin soft, helps blemishes.</li>
      <li>My routine - and therefore my advice - is to wash your face before applying: If you have makeup on, use a (non-oily) makeup remover and then rinse with a few splashes of cool water.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ll see if I continue with this or go back to my old HA serum.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Loaded with anti-oxidants and vitamins, Bodi Skincare hyaluronic acid should be used as part of your daily skincare routine every morning before you apply your makeup, allowing time for it to absorb completely into your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you read up on it, you will learn that Hyalluronic Acid is a natural component in the body, that, when applied topically, plumps up the tissue.</li>
      <li>have used many different types of skin care, including prescription creams from the dermatologist, and I have used formulations containing hyaluronic acid, but apart from how much active ingredient is actually in the bottle, it seems that the synergy with other components is crucial.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought several products like this one because I wasn&#x27;t sure what would work and what would not.  After trying 3 others ones I found this to be the best of the 4.  My face, at 67, did make a nice turn around.  Do I look 40 again....well no.  It did make quite a difference though and I feel better about myself when I look in the mirror.  I will even venture out without base makeup now.  I just put on a little eye liners and blush and I&#x27;m out the door.  That is a miracle.  Complexion is brighter, smoother and radiant now.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Does what it claims to do.  One bottle lasts about 1 mo with day/nite usage.  Like the pump dispenser.</li>
    <li> Not the best. It&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> Bodi Skincare Hyaluronic Acid Serum has a light lavender scent, which helps aid in relaxation as well as to help improve your skin from the inside out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic acid’s biggest claim to fame is its ability to retain water, helping to create a firmer, more toned, and plump appearance to the skin.

    <li> makes the skin soft, helps blemishes.</li>
    <li> Amazing job of smoothing out my 52 year old undereye wrinkles.  I am a Botox fan and use that on my forehead, but undereye wrinkles were freaking me out - no Botox treatment for that!  This reminds me a lot of Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s eye treatment, but without the chalky look I get with PTR&#x27;s product.  I still use a moisturizer 1st, then apply this over.  If I really want the smoothing effect, I forego moisturizer (which seems to dilute the efficacy somewhat) and just use a couple of pumps of Bodi - it is pretty amazing. NO lasting effects, but I&#x27;ll take the short term &#x27;miracle in a bottle&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works for me!</li>
    <li> I use this product for a month twice in a day, love how skin feels, soft and tight.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using the serum and recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> Paid jlmore for this brand but nt seeing reason it cost anymore than other brands I have used in the past. And very small amount for price paid.</li>
    <li> I really like this product! The packaging is clean and very easy to use. I am not one to order products like these from website but this one is one that I do like and like the smell of it also.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT YOU CAN SEE THE RESULTS ON YOUR FACE. YOU LOOK YOUNGER</li>
    <li> Yes .  Feels good.  Healthy.  My skin is lovely.</li>
    <li> First i would like to say i liked the bootle that this comes in. I like the neat , clean professional look. The bottle is a nice pump dispenser I also order a couple items from this company and they were nice to work with. Overall this is a great product. I really enjoy trying out things for my face and see how they work. This is great way to find the ones i really like. i enjoyed this one and i am happy i was able to try it out in exchange for my review. I can honestly telling you after using it a show while it made my skin feel nice and tighter. My Skin feels stronger but more supple and washes cleaner.I also enjoy that it It goes on very smooth and only need a little bit.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd brand of Hyaluronic Acid serum I have tried and it works wonderfully! The other brand works wonders too, but this one was offered at a deeply discounted price, so I decided to try it. The appearance of lines were dramatically reduced after use. If you read up on it, you will learn that Hyalluronic Acid is a natural component in the body, that, when applied topically, plumps up the tissue. My routine - and therefore my advice - is to wash your face before applying: If you have makeup on, use a (non-oily) makeup remover and then rinse with a few splashes of cool water. Lightly pat dry. Apply 1 pump-ful of serum to fingertip, then, using pinky and ring fingers, gently pat and massage in around forehead, eyes and mouth. I use 2 pumps, and apply to my neck and décolletage area as well. Allow to dry for a minute or so, then apply your regular moisturizer. For optimal results, use faithfully, morning and night. I’m 53 with fair skin, and throughout my lifetime, I spent a great deal of time on the beach without sunscreen... the damage was noticeable. I have been using Hyaluronic Acid regularly for about 6 months now, and some of the finer lines seem to have permanently disappeared, while others reappear if I don’t maintain use of the serum. Not all lines will go away completely, but for me, there is at least a 60-75% reduction in them. I can see the difference, and so can others... I receive compliments on my skin fairly often. I’ve started using it on the tops of my hands - and all I can say is OMG! I’m hooked on this stuff!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work and make my skin very dry.</li>
    <li> Realistically, I don’t think any cream can reverse the ageing process on older skin once the wrinkles are there.  But, hopefully, we can use creams to soften the appearance of those wrinkles and forestall the appearance of new ones.  I am also concerned about keeping my skin clean and clear of blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used many different types of skin care, including prescription creams from the dermatologist, and I have used formulations containing hyaluronic acid, but apart from how much active ingredient is actually in the bottle, it seems that the synergy with other components is crucial.  According to the label, this serum contains Vitamins C and E and Lavender Essential Oil, all powerful skin regenerating ingredients, and Aloe Vera and Witch Hazel, soothing and tightening.  It also contains L-Arginine, an amino acid which drives other active ingredients deep into the tissues.  This product is sold with a 100% reimbursement guarantee, which I find reassuring.  As usual, when testing skin care, I discontinued my previous serum and moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I started using Bodi Skincare’s Hyaluronic Acid Serum and Anti-Aging Moisturizer in combination, I was a bit astounded at the outcome. The result of using these products together has cleared my skin beyond my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the two products twice a day: in the morning and at bedtime. After washing my face, I apply the Hyaluronic Acid Serum and within seconds can feel my skin tightening. I wait for a few minutes until that sensation passes, and then apply the Anti-Aging Moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum comes in a bottle with a pump dispenser.  I like that the bottle is transparent in the mid-section; it is easy to tell how much product remains.  The bottle contains 1 oz or 30 ml, pretty normal for a serum. Although I agreed to try these products in return for an honest review, I will be buying replacements because the combination of the two is the best I have used.</li>
    <li> Seems to work good, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Product was as described and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Great clean face serum for the face. Your face will feel wonderful after using it twice a day. Plus the packaging is quite elegant and it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;Benefits of Hyaluronic Acid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most skin damaging elements are UVB rays from the sun. Hyaluronic acid benefits the skin as it protects the skin from UVB rays (and the scavenging reactive oxygen species they generate), which can cause sunspots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for the purpose of inspection and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I really love it. Made my skin look good.</li>
    <li> After my cleansing regimen, I apply this and it is great!  Tightens my skin, and has noticeably reduced the size of my pores</li>
    <li> Seems to be working very well.  My skin feels smoother and more plump.  Also this product is a lot less expensive than others I have used. I have been using it once a day and follow with a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Only been using this for about a week but there is significant change in skin texture. I would recommend it</li>
    <li> Did not work at all. Used per instructions without results.</li>
    <li> It plumps fine to medium lines for sure.  Must use with moisturizer. I have dry skin and would never put on my entire face, only on lines. Serum is good quality. Comes in pump.</li>
    <li> The Bodi Skincare Hyaluronic Acid Serum is a pretty good product. I use this as an alternative to a more expensive hyaluronic acid serum I&#x27;ve been using for the past 3 years. I have not had any skin irritations (my face is very sensative!). The serum goes on easily and I can layer this under my moisturizer and sunscreen. While I have not noticed any significant benefits/changes to my skin, I am pleased that it does not bother it. We&#x27;ll see if I continue with this or go back to my old HA serum.</li>
