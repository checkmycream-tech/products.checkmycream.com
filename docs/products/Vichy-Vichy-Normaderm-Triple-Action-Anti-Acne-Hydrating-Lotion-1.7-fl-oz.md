      <li>Love love love this stuff!!!</li>
      <li>This is a lovely product!  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>This product just melts right into the skin and is great under make up.</li>
      <li>paid for a new product but this kind of handling shows a great disrespect toward the client.</li>
      <li>I will try for some more time to see if it worths the price.</li>
      <li>Is not greasy, but keeps moisture more than others for oily skin.</li>
      <li>but this one I recommend 1000% :)</li>
      <li>Love the products of vichy</li>
      <li>Love this face lotion</li>
      <li>$ cheap on here compared to beauty stores!</li>
      <li>Great product that keeps my skin clear and healthy looking.</li>
      <li>But the product itself it&#x27;s just a nice lotion like many others you can find at a more reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I am soooo happy that I finally found a hydrating lotion that doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts on my faceeeeeee!!!!</li>
      <li>Leaves your skin feeling smooth and silky and not greasy at all.</li>
      <li>Hope it is genuine product from Vichy.  </li>
      <li>The receipt also mentioned free sample included, however, I did not see any samples.</li>
      <li>THAT ACTUALLY REALLY WORKS!!!</li>
      <li>I strongly feel my face has not looked this good and been this blemish free for as long as I can remember</li>
      <li>Excellent product for delicate skin</li>
      <li>I purchased the product at local pharmacy before, and loved it.  </li>
      <li>I got lucky with my first experience with Vichy products being a couple free samples.</li>
      <li>Great for use after doing a mask or at home peel, it calms my skin down if I do have any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, with some acne fighting lotions, you put it on after you wash your face, and then start putting your make up on, and the product starts to bead up and flake off your skin.</li>
      <li>How do I know for sure that it&#x27;s new ?</li>
      <li>It made my skin feel smoother after the first application and it smells like a spa treat you would give yourself!  </li>
      <li>My daughter loves it, she has sensitive skin and most product irritates and clogs her skin, but not this one.</li>
      <li>The cream is not easy-to-spread-out compare to my first one.  </li>
      <li>I instantly fell in love and I was sold.</li>
      <li>Works really well!</li>
      <li>The light cream feels great on your skin all day long and the little tingling you sometimes get tells you it&#x27;s working.</li>
      <li>I feel it works with very little effort but feels so good to have on</li>
      <li>I had been on the hunt for a good moisturizer for a long time; I wanted something I could actually feel/</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t really say that it helped me get rid of the acne</li>
      <li>It works better as a night cream rather than a moisturizer under make-up; it has a slight tendancy to \\&quot;pill\\&quot; when rubbed as you might when applying foundation.  </li>
      <li>will certainly be buying this product again, and I&#x27;m already suggesting it to all my friends, weither they deal with adult acne</li>
      <li>It has multiple acne fighting indredients, and keeps my skin feeling fresh and supple as well.</li>
      <li>But after a few applying, I think I love it</li>
      <li>and I absolutely live it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching around for a high quality acne fighting lotion, and I came across this Triple Action one here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>This dried my skin out more so that when I put my makeup on, my skin was flaking off as I brushed my makeup on.</li>
      <li>After having my skin super dry from the epiduo this is the only lotion that has helped</li>
      <li>Takes a few days to come in but so worth it!</li>
      <li>My skin is normally combination but this over-dried my skin entirely.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again as a new regular part of my beauty routine!</li>
      <li>I live in a dry climate &amp; have PCOS acne and have been on a search for something to help with my acne.  </li>
      <li>It contains Salicylic Acid which can prevent acne but the lotion itself is very hydrated for my skin, not as other anti-acne products that would dry out my skin.  </li>

<li> Taking the product off the skin, and your make up looking terrible.</li>
<li> I have the worst type of skin; oily, any lotion gives me pimples</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching around for a high quality acne fighting lotion, and I came across this Triple Action one here on Amazon. I did a lot of research on Vichy and prodect before ordering it through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for an affordable face lotion, and this lotion isn&#x27;t as affordable as I would like... $20 give or take depending on which merchent your buy through, I ordered though NY Beauty &amp; Co. Plus you&#x27;re getting only 1.7oz. But what research I did on Normaderm, and the ingredients, it seemed like just the product I&#x27;ve been looking for. It has multiple acne fighting indredients, and keeps my skin feeling fresh and supple as well. As I mentioned, getting only 1.7oz for the price is expensive, but a little goes a long way, just small amount goes all over my face, and neck. Great for use after doing a mask or at home peel, it calms my skin down if I do have any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, with some acne fighting lotions, you put it on after you wash your face, and then start putting your make up on, and the product starts to bead up and flake off your skin. Taking the product off the skin, and your make up looking terrible. This product just melts right into the skin and is great under make up. It&#x27;s not at all greasy either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will certainly be buying this product again, and I&#x27;m already suggesting it to all my friends, weither they deal with adult acne like I do or not, it&#x27;s a great product to use. The Beta Hydroxy, Lactic, and Glycolic acids keep your skin looking great.</li>
    <li> I live in a dry climate &amp; have PCOS acne and have been on a search for something to help with my acne.  This did not help.  This dried my skin out more so that when I put my makeup on, my skin was flaking off as I brushed my makeup on. My skin is normally combination but this over-dried my skin entirely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year and I absolutely live it. Got a really good price on the product!</li>
    <li> Love this face lotion and it&#x27;s 5$ cheap on here compared to beauty stores!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it, she has sensitive skin and most product irritates and clogs her skin, but not this one.</li>
    <li> I got lucky with my first experience with Vichy products being a couple free samples. I instantly fell in love and I was sold. I had been on the hunt for a good moisturizer for a long time; I wanted something I could actually feel/see working but didn&#x27;t weigh my face down or make it feel greasy/oily either. This product is awesome. The light cream feels great on your skin all day long and the little tingling you sometimes get tells you it&#x27;s working. I strongly feel my face has not looked this good and been this blemish free for as long as I can remember and I am lazy with my daily routine. I am definitely going to keep using this product I feel it works with very little effort but feels so good to have on it&#x27;s hard to not make it a daily habit. Thank you, Vichy -- my search is over!</li>
    <li> Is not greasy, but keeps moisture more than others for oily skin. I have already used for a year, it&#x27;s not a miracle, but helps with pimples and blackhead. I will try for some more time to see if it worths the price.</li>
    <li> Love the products of vichy</li>
    <li> The package was taped. How do I know for sure that it&#x27;s new ?&lt;br /&gt;I paid for a new product but this kind of handling shows a great disrespect toward the client. I&#x27;m not criticizing the product ...if you decide to buy this item try a different seller than ParaDEM.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed to find that it&#x27;s not the &#x27;anti-acne Hydrating Lotion&#x27; as title describes but &amp;#34;Global anti-imperfection hydrating care&amp;#34; when I received. But after a few applying, I think I love it and my skin keep moisturized but not oily. I wanted to find a lotion for summer to prevent acne and oil, so I gave this a try. It can do the things it claims:Clears Acne, Mattifies, Hydrates. It contains Salicylic Acid which can prevent acne but the lotion itself is very hydrated for my skin, not as other anti-acne products that would dry out my skin.  So I&#x27;ll keep using it during this summer.</li>
    <li> I purchased the product at local pharmacy before, and loved it.  After finish up the one purchased from the pharmacy, I bought this one from amazon. The cream is not easy-to-spread-out compare to my first one.  Not sure why. Hope it is genuine product from Vichy.  The receipt also mentioned free sample included, however, I did not see any samples.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely product!  It made my skin feel smoother after the first application and it smells like a spa treat you would give yourself!  It works better as a night cream rather than a moisturizer under make-up; it has a slight tendancy to \\&quot;pill\\&quot; when rubbed as you might when applying foundation.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again as a new regular part of my beauty routine!</li>
    <li> The exp time is 07/15. Almost expired!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This lotion is a must I&#x27;ll probably use it for the rest of my life. I love it! Leaves your skin feeling smooth and silky and not greasy at all. After having my skin super dry from the epiduo this is the only lotion that has helped</li>
    <li> The best moisturizer for me, with my acne-prone skin.</li>
    <li> Great product that keeps my skin clear and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why there are always some &amp;#34;dead skin&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;dead lotion&amp;#34; (I don&#x27;t know what is it. It looks like the tiny stick of lotion) after I wear this on my face and then wear the make up. Also, there is no help with my acne.</li>
    <li> Does not work with my acne.</li>
    <li> I ordered for this product triple action but got the wrong product global imperfection hydrating care. This is so annoying. Had to wait for more than a month for the wrong product.. ridiculous. .</li>
    <li> I am soooo happy that I finally found a hydrating lotion that doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts on my faceeeeeee!!!! I am soo soo happy! I have the worst type of skin; oily, any lotion gives me pimples but this one I recommend 1000% :)</li>
    <li> Great product!! Takes a few days to come in but so worth it! Love love love this stuff!!! Works really well!</li>
    <li> It is a very good moisturizer. It leaves the skin hydrated without a greasing feeling. Not only does it help to control acne, it also evened my skin tone within a few weeks of use. I use this all the time.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really say that it helped me get rid of the acne but it definitely made my skin feel better(smoother and softer). the only thing that helped me was giving up chocolates and sweets. THAT ACTUALLY REALLY WORKS!!! so try that. But the product itself it&#x27;s just a nice lotion like many others you can find at a more reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Works about as well as any other...</li>
    <li> Excellent product for delicate skin</li>
