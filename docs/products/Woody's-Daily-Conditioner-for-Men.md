      <li>Good shampoo for oily hair and scalp</li>
      <li>I love Wood&#x27;s products and this seller was great.  </li>
      <li>Great shampoo if you like your hair and scalp to feel clean.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really nice manly but refreshing smell.</li>
      <li>Nice light scent is not too perfume laced and produces nice lather</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Again, like many Woody&#x27;s product and this was not for me.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Price is very good compared to other places.</li>
      <li>Coupled with a 0.5% zinc pyrithione conditioner, this is all you will need to get a clean, itch-free scalp that your barber/stylist will appreciate.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Leaves my scalp and hair felling nice and soft and clean</li>
      <li>It is a remarkably mild shampoo.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth buying this guy in bulk.</li>
      <li>bought second time for myself and was popular stocking stuffer gift too</li>
      <li>The reason is because only a nickel-sized amount is needed for me to get a huge lather and very clean hair.</li>
      <li>I thought it was a joke at first because Woody&#x27;s shampoo smells like dog shampoo.</li>
      <li>This is a excellent product for short, natural, unprocessed hair.</li>
      <li>Today, more than a year later, I am just now reaching the end of the bottle.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m the first one to rate this 1star.</li>
      <li>Hair is super soft no need for my coconut conditioner, but packaging arrived leaking.</li>
      <li>and I ended up putting it out in the curb in hoping that one of these dreadlocked nappy haired hippies down here in Ocean Beach would make better use of it that me.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo and have been using it for quite a few years, it makes my scalp tingle a little and has a cooling sensation also.  </li>

    <li> I bought this at a local salon. I love it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. My wife steals it all the time.</li>
    <li> Use this product daily&lt;br /&gt;Have bought second time for myself and was popular stocking stuffer gift too</li>
    <li> Hair is super soft no need for my coconut conditioner, but packaging arrived leaking.</li>
    <li> Works well for daily use...</li>
    <li> I like the way my hair comes out using this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased a 12-ounce bottle of Woody&#x27;s Daily Shampoo in February 2014. Today, more than a year later, I am just now reaching the end of the bottle. The reason is because only a nickel-sized amount is needed for me to get a huge lather and very clean hair. It is a remarkably mild shampoo. Coupled with a 0.5% zinc pyrithione conditioner, this is all you will need to get a clean, itch-free scalp that your barber/stylist will appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length of time it has taken for me to use a small bottle of this shampoo is a testament to the quality of this product. I will be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> Nice light scent is not too perfume laced and produces nice lather&lt;br /&gt;Quality men&#x27;s care product and adding the conditioner would likely help with manageability for tough to tame hair</li>
    <li> I love Wood&#x27;s products and this seller was great.  However, my scalp did not like this shampoo.  Left me scratching head, literally.  Again, like many Woody&#x27;s product and this was not for me.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo if you like your hair and scalp to feel clean. I use it after a workout almost everyday</li>
    <li> Good shampoo for oily hair and scalp</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Recommended by stylist and it is good. Doesn&#x27;t leave residue in your hair. Price is very good compared to other places.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo for a good price. Hair feels good after washing.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m the first one to rate this 1star. I bought this because of the picture on it, but soon regretted it. I thought it was a joke at first because Woody&#x27;s shampoo smells like dog shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t lather up and I ended up putting it out in the curb in hoping that one of these dreadlocked nappy haired hippies down here in Ocean Beach would make better use of it that me.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve ordered and it met my expectation and I received it when I was supposed to.</li>
    <li> Boyfriend wanted a manly shampoo and this stuff smells awesome. It&#x27;s a really nice manly but refreshing smell. He loves it.</li>
    <li> The product itself is great. However when I received it in the mail the seal cap was cracked and the shampoo leaked out. I lost about a quarter of the product.</li>
    <li> This is a excellent product for short, natural, unprocessed hair. Man or woman. My husband likes it for the quality of the product as well as it&#x27;s manly smell. We have been using this product for the last 2 years.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and have been using it for quite a few years, it makes my scalp tingle a little and has a cooling sensation also.  Leaves my scalp and hair felling nice and soft and clean</li>
    <li> This product has worked well for me and is a size that lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend a while back and we are still working on the bottle! Definitely worth buying this guy in bulk.</li>
