<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a great, rich moisturizer that leaves my skin feeling soft all day. I love that it&#x27;s unscented so it doesn&#x27;t clash with any other fragrances I may be wearing. It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin as well. And the best thing about it is that it is vegan! Great for every part of the body, including hands and feet. It&#x27;s the only lotion I&#x27;ll use during the winter time.</li>
    <li> Mild and very effective lotion. I put it on my whole body after every shower and don&#x27;t have any greasy residue. My skin stays smooth and it&#x27;s never dry since I first started using it about a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a sickly sweet smell like many other lotions and that it takes a short amount of time to rub into my skin.</li>
    <li> Fantastic. I use these with my doTerra essential oils (I use and distribute them). Fab!</li>
    <li> This is simply not what I have been buying.  It&#x27;s a different formulation...stickier and doesn&#x27;t absorb as well.</li>
    <li> Nice and light on the skin makes dry skin feel moisturized. Great for sensitive skin, eczema, etc. Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  It keeps my skin soft all day and isn&#x27;t greasy.  It also gets great reviews on skindeep.</li>
    <li> This lotion is wonderful. We are a family of sensitive skin and we need to have the hypo-allergic lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Your skin feels so soft and silky after application.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best lotion you can buy.</li>
    <li> my favorite lotion and a good price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews about this product and about it smelling funny.  The first bottle I purchased was fine.  The second, smells a little funny.  However, since it&#x27;s unscented, maybe it&#x27;s just the normal weird, non-smell.  Either way, it&#x27;s a great product without harsh chemicals to irritate your skin.  And it&#x27;s a necessity during a northern winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the packaging for this one was less than desired.  The pump top was taped, with scotch tape, and not effectively.  The top was loose and lotion was all over the place inside the box in which it was packaged.  Luckily, the other product in the box was sealed so not damaged, but could have been upsetting if it was a gift!  The loosening of the top could have been prevented with better packaging but to be fair, the package arrived on a 10 degree day, so it&#x27;s also possible that any extreme temperature transitions could have created some expansion and contraction that could cause lotion seepage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, I still love this lotion!  It&#x27;s my go-to!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent lotion.  It moisturizes well but is not greasy and absorbs well.  My skin is very dry and this is helping.  I really like that it is not tested on animals and has no parabens or other undesirable ingredients.</li>
    <li> Did not receive the product I ordered.  I ordered the product that had blue and purple printing and received one that had purple and green printing.  Product is okay, but not great.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and liked it quite a bit.  The 2nd time I ordered it, the lotion was a tacky consistency and had a slight odor to it that wasn&#x27;t a nice aroma.  I realized the first time I ordered this lotion it was in a different bottle, it was the \\&quot;newer\\&quot; version.  This must be the old version.  Either the old version needed to be improved or this lotion has been sitting in a warehouse too long and has gotten icky.  Would not buy again unless it is the new version.</li>
    <li> I love this unscented lotion - it&#x27;s light, yet it still moisturizes. I like it because the vast majority of it&#x27;s ingredients are natural. I melt a little coconut oil and add it in and shake it like crazy and that makes the perfect lotion for me!</li>
    <li> No scent which is great, it could be a little richer but generally goes on well and thankful for it being natural.</li>
    <li> I thought getting an fragrance-free lotion would be nice so that my husband and I could share, but it smells like wax (or something?) and is just not that great. The lotion is ok, but not life-changing. Won&#x27;t be buying again, and am considering just pitching it and finding something else.</li>
    <li> packed with heavy product, part of the prroduct leaked out.  left message, no responce, very disaapointed.  Not very competative when 20% is wasted due to packeging</li>
    <li> great lotion but not as smooth as I expected. this is a great size though for the price.</li>
    <li> Fragrance free essential daily treatment for people with dry skin like me. We subscribe to this item to ensure we&#x27;re never out.</li>
    <li> not the exact choice i was looking for .... be careful... packaging can lead you to wrong choice...  i wanted the maximum dry skin formula but when i reordered I realized that the formula had changed.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item by accident, meaning to buy the Maximum Dry Skin Formula. I was disappointed when I realized my mistake, but thought I would try to make it work, anyway.  However, as soon as I put the lotion on my skin, I noticed that it had a strange chemical smell to it. I just placed an order for the correct lotion, which I love, and this stuff is going back.</li>
    <li> This is awesome lotion</li>
    <li> This lotion smells like rotten yogurt, every time I apply it to my skin I feel like vomiting.  I don&#x27;t know how well this product works but I can&#x27;t get passed it&#x27;s repulsive smell.</li>
    <li> Works very well. I live in upstate NY and this winter has been the coldest (and the driest) that I can recall. While the other reviews are correct about the slight plastic odor this emits, it is not overly pungent nor is the smell &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34;. I mix it with a little bath and body works Energy and solves the issue. The bottom line is that this lotion does what it claims to do and does it with the first application. Great lotion!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite everyday lotion. It&#x27;s unscented, it soaks in quickly, isn&#x27;t sticky at all, and it moisturizes so well. I&#x27;ve repurchased this over and over.</li>
    <li> Absorbs great. I like that it has no scent as that sometimes irritates my skin.</li>
    <li> I have tried many lotions and would jump from one to another till I found this.  It is reasonably priced and works.  It is super moisturizing; a lifesaver during winter months but light enough for summer months.  It is absorbed well by the skin, no residue.  I also am very sensitive to scents and love the unscented option.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and decided that alba&#x27;s lotion would be a great choice for my skin. I also purchased their body wash.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion makes me itch!! I&#x27;ve never had problems with any other lotion before. It&#x27;s quite strange. I think I&#x27;m stuck with a 32 oz bottle of lotion for a while.</li>
    <li> I have been researching a product that does not leave my skin greasy and leaving my skin feeling dry after it has been on for a few hours. I read almost all of the product reviews before buying this product, and I have to say, I made a wise choice (my thanks to the other reviewers)! My skin feels soft all of the time. As stated by other reviewers, the smell is a bit unusual, but it does not last long (thankfully). As long as this company makes this product, I will be buying it.</li>
    <li> I wanted a lotion that would leave less weird chemicals on my skin.  I tried some in my local health food store, and I LOVE this lotion. It goes on nice and thick, but it&#x27;s not greasy AT ALL and it absorbs quickly.  The only thing that bugs me is the smell.  It&#x27;s unscented, so it doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance, but it does have an odor.  I am SUPER sensitive to smells, so I just mixed it with a little bit of another organic scented lotion and it&#x27;s all good now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran out of the lotion awhile back and tried a different organic brand. Not impressed. I went out tonight and bought at our health food store. Maybe it&#x27;s because the lotion is from a different batch, but it doesn&#x27;t smell funky like the one I got from Amazon. I dunno, maybe they start to get rancid after awhile? There are a lot of oils in the lotion...hmmm. Anyhow, the one I just got is great! I&#x27;d recommend sending the product back if you get one that smells \\&quot;off.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Awesome lotion! Not scented so it doesn&#x27;t leave a perfume scent which I really like. My skin feels fresh and rejuvenated.</li>
    <li> I bought a 12-oz bottle originally a while back and loved it!  Bought the bigger bottle, and have been very disappointed.  I prefer unscented lotion, but when I got this second batch, it wasn&#x27;t unscented, it smelled like yogurt!  There are no milk products in the lotion, so I was tempted to return it, but was too lazy.  The lotion works OK, but not as good as the other bottle and for god&#x27;s sake, it smells like milk!  I keep adding mint/menthol oil to mask the weird scent.  It&#x27;s almost gone, and I&#x27;ve ordered [[ASIN:B001ECQ3EK Upper Canada Soap And Candle Naturally Nourishing Body Lotion, Wild Mint Lime, 12-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 2)]] to replace it.  It&#x27;s a lot more expensive, but I&#x27;d rather pay and know I&#x27;m going to get something I like instead.</li>
    <li> I ordered three bottles of Alba Botanica very emollient body lotion, unscented, 32 Ounce bottles, the ones that have the blue stripe around the center of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the bottles that you see in the picture at the above right with the blue stripe around the center and i received the New Alba Botanica that has the green strip around the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The add from Amazon said they would refund me by way of a credit for $4.++ dollars however at the post office when they asked me what was in the box I told them lotion and they said if the box had a book in it then the freight cost would be the $4.++ dollar figure however since it was lotion in the box my cost to return the Package Services parcel would cost me $14.12 which is what I paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James</li>
    <li> My favorite body lotion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years, and I keep going back to it. It&#x27;s safe for my chemical and fragrance sensitivities.</li>
    <li> I have a thing about most lotions leaving my hands feeling sticky and slick where I then have to wash my hands to get the feeling to go away.  Not this one!  I love the lightness of this lotion and how it absorbs quickly with no strong scent.  The ingredients seem fairly &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; as I know this label tends to be overused and misleading.  I don&#x27;t think any beauty products, mainstream or green, and  100% perfect when it comes to chemicals and ingredients- unless you make your own with pure coconut oil, lye, castile, etc.  I&#x27;m happy with this product (this line actually- I&#x27;ve tried several other Alba Botanical products and have been beyond pleased.)</li>
    <li> GREAT! Free of parabens and other icky chemicals and feels great on your skin.  Non-greasy!</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of alba products. Unlike alot of companies they do not test on animals, use no animal by-products, and use natural ingredients. No nasty chemicals. I have been using their lotion for about 1 year. I prefer unscented but the scented doesn&#x27;t smell bad. It&#x27;s excellent for dry skin. Does not feel greasy or heavy.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite body lotion. It goes on so light, but it will keep your legs dry for 8 hours plus, I am amazed. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of brand of lotions, this really is the best bang for my buck.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion and will purchase it again. It does not have a scent and is a great moisturizes. The texture is thick and creamy and perfect for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> My mother loves this for I try to keep this her stocked up.  It does the job for the right price.</li>
    <li> This has been my go to body lotion for years.  It is very emollient, as advertised, with out a bunch chemicals.</li>
    <li> I love how this feels going on, feels rich and thick but not greasy.  I gave it a four BC I&#x27;m not sure of the sourcing of the ingredients.</li>
    <li> The pump wouldn&#x27;t open. Very annoying. The cream is good, though. It&#x27;s light and smells neutral. I&#x27;ll keep it even although the pump doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Worked as advertised, will buy again.</li>
    <li> Good price, good feeling, good moisturizer, i recommend!</li>
    <li> This lotion was ordered as an error by the seller. Originally the &#x27;original&#x27; was to be sent to me because it is what was ordered. upon opening the lotion I noticed the old smell of it which is unpleasant. i pressed the pump and the lotion spurt out an oily water substance. i pumped it one more time and it finally gave me actual lotion. When i rubbed the lotion it was like water, very runny. This lotion does nothing for my skin and now i am stuck with a stinky, watery big bottle of lotion. usually alba products are great, I should have heeded to the other reviewers when they said the formula changed for the worse.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  It works really well and is truly safe.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion! Love the new more organic formula although I notice it is a lot thicker &amp; I need to use more product because it soaks into my dry skin rather quickly. I believe the old formula contained dimethicone &amp; it no longer does which is probably the difference in consistency &amp; why its thicker. But I am happier that it is now I believe entirely organic!</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion. It is not greasy and keeps my skin moisturized all day. I have psoriasis over a large portion of my body and this lotion is very good a t keeping me comfortable. I only have to use it once a day</li>
    <li> Used this Body Lotion for years and then became allergic to it. Gave it to someone else in the family.</li>
    <li> The pump does not work at all and lotion had spilled out of the bottle making a mess. Fortunately it was sealed in a plastic bag so the rest of the items in the box stayed dry.</li>
    <li> It moisturizes well, but the unscented has a bit of a strange smell to it. Fortunately the smell does not linger at all, but when I first apply it, I smell like donut grease for a few minutes (this is the only way I can explain the smell). I will not be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Alba Botanica Lotion for years, professionally and personally.  My clients loved the fact that it was truly unscented and felt clean on their skin.  They appreciated the fact that they didn&#x27;t feel greasy, sticky or waxy, or had even a small hint of any kind of scent upon their return to work, or the rest of their day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was extremely disappointed to find out that the new &amp; improved formula had not changed for the better.  It had a subtly pungent smell and was sticky and left a waxy film on my sheets, the clients&#x27; skin and on the clients&#x27; clothes... Unfortunately, I got complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called the customer service number on Alba Botanica&#x27;s website to complain about the new product.  The response that I received was an envelope of more Alba Botanica product that I didn&#x27;t want.</li>
    <li> This product is better than advertised.  We use it constantly and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  And, Amazon has made it even more affordable than in retail stores.  Whatever the price, though, it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the most natural ingredients and it doesn&#x27;t moisturize your skin as much as I thought it would. I think there are better brands out there, but for the cost and amount of lotion you get, it&#x27;s an ok product...</li>
    <li> I was little skeptical but wow~  this lotion is really nice.  It absorbs really well and feels great after applying it.  Only complaint if any, is the scent.  It says unscented but i can smell it but even then it does not bother me much.  This is awesome product at a great price!  will definitely buy it again in the future.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion recently from Target because I wanted a lotion that was \\&quot;natural,\\&quot; with no parabens, sulfates, etc to use while pregnant. After using the product a couple of times, I&#x27;m going to have to shelf it. It smells kind of like beer, for one thing. The other thing is that it just does not want to absorb into my skin, even hours after application. I put this on after a shower/before bed and just felt gross all night long because it was so sticky feeling. It didn&#x27;t absorb so much that the next night while showering, it felt like the lotion was coming off of my body. I would definitely not recommend even trying this lotion - it is not worth the expense and the bottle is gigantic and now it&#x27;s just going to take up space in my bathroom cabinet unless I throw it away.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It provides great moisture while not being too thick. And it really is unscented.</li>
    <li> No smell, great consistency, and VERY moisturizing. I live in a high desert climate and never get itchy after application like with so many other lotions. Perfect for sensitive skin. I can share with my husband as it does not have a scent.</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion all I ever use. I keep a 32 container on  my vanity &amp; have a 12 oz. bottle at my kitchen sink. I have also given this to friends &amp; they&#x27;ve gotten hooked on it, too. Good value, not greasy, absorbs quickly &amp; easily &amp; I love that I can get it without a scent. I wear an fairly expensive cologne &amp; don&#x27;t want my lotion interfering w/the scent of the cologne. I highly recommend this!!</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion - it&#x27;s the lotion that keeps on giving. I give my wife foot rubs most nights, and this lotion lasts forever.</li>
    <li> This lotion is thick but not greasy. It absorbs well in the skin and never feels too heavy. The container is huge, so it lasts a long time. I ordered a second bottle but still haven&#x27;t touched it as the first one seems to be lasting forever. Unscented really means unscented - no weird odors or perfume.</li>
    <li> It is everything it says it is. Non-greasy, absorbs quickly, has no fragrance and is botanically-free of additives and chemicals. Wish I had found it sooner.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to update my review.  Those who think that Alba is so great never experienced the original formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good News for the grieving former Alba users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beauty Without Cruelty  (BWC) Fragrance Free Lotion has the same feel and consistancy of the Alba Very Emollient Lotion that we knew and loved.  You can order it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only comes in 8 oz and 16 oz bottles but what the heck.  I&#x27;m in heaven again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADIOS ALBA!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**********************************************&lt;br /&gt;Alba if you are reading the comments notice that your loyal users were satisfied with the old formula.  The new formula SUCKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remove the shea butter or decrease the amount.  The lotion is too thick and sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to rave to everyone about this lotion because it was emollient enough to keep my skin soft and moist but light enough so that I did not feel sticky, waxy or uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new formula has changed all of this.  The lotion is now just short of body butter and I have to add distilled water just so I can bear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I have a closet full of the new formula and unless something changes I will not be purchasing another bottle.</li>
    <li> Husband works as a medical provider and so he needed a lotion that is unscented to wear while working with patients. This lotion is great - moisturizes well, non-greasy, quickly absorbed into skin. Love that it&#x27;s natural, so we know we&#x27;re not putting any harsh chemicals on our skin. Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I use this lotion everyday.  I try to use products that don&#x27;t have many ingredients that I can&#x27;t pronounce. For the price, this is the best deal.</li>
    <li> NOT UNSCENTED----------&lt;br /&gt;I have bought this brand unscented many times before, but from this Amazon it is scented although the label says that it is not. I do not like the scent.</li>
    <li> I have been on an organic kick and read up on how certain ingredients can coat your skin, making it feel smooth, but not actually giving it moisture. I get really dry skin, especially in the desert. I would itch so badly that it was leaving scars on my skin..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the Alba Botanica in hopes of saving my skin. I can tell you that it will help with your moisture needs, HOWEVER I have two complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first being the consistency. It felt greasy, and is VERY runny. (Maybe it&#x27;s just mine.) Because it feels greasy to me, I avoid using it on my face. And just remember, a little bit goes a long way. I had to learn this the hard way when I put the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; amount that I usually use with lotion on my legs, and used WAY too much. I had to keep finding places on my body to put the lotion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second is the smell of this lotion. I liked the fact that it states \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; but believe me, it is far from. And it&#x27;s not a pleasant scent either. The only way that I can compare it to is Elmer&#x27;s glue. I thought it wasn&#x27;t that noticeable until my fiance asked me what the heck that smell was... So now, when I put it on, I make sure to do it after I spray my perfume on in hopes that it masks the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides these complaints the product itself, for what it is intended for (moisturizing) does not disappoint. It contains aloe vera, which does not help all with their sunburns but it certain did wonders for mine. My arms get burnt pretty easily, and within a day I no longer have redness or peeling. Green tea extracts are used to \\&quot;wake up\\&quot; your skin, which this definitely does. After one days use my legs skin felt softer.</li>
    <li> A product I have been using for years, Alba Bontanica&#x27;s Very Emollient Body Lotion is available from Amazon at a very good price.  For those who need an excellent mosturizer for very dry skin, Alba Bontanica makes the best in both scented and unscented versions.  Get the 32 ounce size for less than $13 from Amazon!</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly. Works great</li>
    <li> We use this lotion for the entire family for many years.</li>
    <li> This Very emollient lotion is actually a different newer batch dated 2007 witch has a different mixture and new ingredients.  It caused a bad red very sunburn like reaction in me. I have used this same lotion for years with no problems.  Too bad I really did like the prior mix.&lt;br /&gt;Lots of reports from others just like mine on the internet.  Returned my order.</li>
    <li> i think it&#x27;s a good stuff, it is absorbed so quickly when i spred it on my body. very soft with no smell:)&lt;br /&gt;the most important thing is it helps me keeping skin from dry, and it feels good.&lt;br /&gt;worth to try</li>
    <li> When I found Alba lotion for this extraordinary price, I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes. I&#x27;ve been paying $20 to $30 for this size bottle at Whole Foods, so you can imagine my shock when I found it here for less than $14.00.&lt;br /&gt;Though I ordered the wrong type of lotion, this is still a wonderful product. It&#x27;s the one lotion I have found that does not clog pores or leave you feeling greasy. Though this product said \\&quot;unscented\\&quot;, to me, it does have a slight chemical smell that vanishes in a very short time.&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent product at and excellent price, and I would suggest it to anyone who has a problem with dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00424WVAW Body Lotion, Very Emollient, Original, Unscented, 32 oz.]]</li>
    <li> This lotion is fantastic! It&#x27;s thick and creamy out of the bottle but soaks into skin like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. It leaves no oily or greasy residue and leaves skin incredibly soft. I can even use it right after shaving, which is great because every other lotion I have used has irritated my skin.  It is not, however, completely unscented; it has a light natural scent, sort of &#x27;planty&#x27; if you will. I actually kind of like it, but if you&#x27;re looking for completely unscented this probably isn&#x27;t for you. It has a long list of natural oils and extracts, so just make sure you check the ingredients for any potential allergies first. All in all great purchase!</li>
    <li> I hate smelling like, well, anything. When I choose personal hygiene products, like deodorant or shampoo, I tend to choose the \\&quot;clean\\&quot;-smelling ones. I hate smelling like trees or baby powder or fruit or whatever. That said, this lotion has a faint smell to it, but it&#x27;s so light, and so neutral, that it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. Realistically, I suppose it has to smell like something, but for being lotion, it&#x27;s rather surprising how little smell it has. You can only smell it if you really try to, and only when you first apply it. No lingering scent, or lotioniness/greasiness/slipperiness. You just rub it in, wait a minute or two, and your skin feels like skin. Normal, non-smelly, non-goopy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as moisturizing capabilities go, it works great. I have super dry skin. Like, I was so embarrassed by my white, flaky, hard cuticles that I would often make a conscious effort to \\&quot;casually\\&quot; ball my hand up to hide them. Using this once a day has fixed me right up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way with this stuff, too. I use 1/2 pump or so per day from the 32 ounce bottle, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need a second bottle anytime soon, though I definitely plan to order more of this when it comes time.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT. IF YOU HAVE USED AND LIKE, IT IS AN INCREDIBLE DEAL. SOAKS INTO SKIN. MANY MASSAGE THERAPIST USE INSTEAD OF OIL. WILL SAVE ALOT OF MONEY BUYING THIS SIZE.</li>
    <li> Best lotion! There is almost no smell and feels great on my skin, is super moisturizing and soaks in quickly. I won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> As far as lotions go I think this one is pretty great. Too often I find lotions that are too thin and I just feel like I am rubbing water on my skin with no real benefit. This stuff has substance and actually relieves my dry skin without leaving an oily coating. The reason I am giving it four stars instead of five is that to me it smells like Elmer&#x27;s glue, so whenever I put it on I kind of feel like a kindergartner rubbing paste all over myself. But the smell doesn&#x27;t last long so it&#x27;s not too much of a bother.</li>
    <li> very good product, but not a standout</li>
    <li> I mix grapeseed &amp; hazelnut oil in with this lotion and it&#x27;s perfect for my skin. Always best to use unscented products on the skin !</li>
    <li> I used this lotion for many years and found it to be the best available anywhere. It was light, odorless, and easily absorbed. Unfortunately, the &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; formula is none of these things. It&#x27;s much thicker, has a strange smell, and is not well absorbed. A great product was ruined. Too bad.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell all flowery, although it does smell a little lotion-y.  It is creamy type lotion that takes a little while to absorb, but does not leave an oily residue.  Maybe a bit of a wax residue if you use a lot of it.  I have psoriasis and my hands get super dry and crack.  This lotion helps to protect my hands from everyday irritants and re-moisturize them after hand washing or dishes.  After trying a lot of lotions, reading a lot of reviews, and using Eucerine and Nivea a lot, I still love the Alba body lotion.  Only the purple one, I haven&#x27;t tried the rest and the reviews aren&#x27;t convincing me to try them.  I have been using this lotion since &#x27;09 or &#x27;10 and continue to use it.  As my hands have gotten worse I have tried other products, and use other products in addition to this lotion, but this lotion is still rather irreplaceable.  Much better than Vasoline or Lubriderm or Aveeno or any of the others I have tried, although I do have to use heavier lotions on the driest areas of my hands.  For my body, I use Alba every couple days after my morning shower and its perfect.  I never have to worry about smelling like some crazy fruity lotion or consider where I am going before applying lotion.</li>
    <li> Its light but still rich and smooth and makes my skin super soft. I love that it has less chemicals than other lotions.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this after I used Alba&#x27;s kid&#x27;s 45 spf sunscreen while on a hiking trip in the Midwest canyons. I was getting roasted &amp; my rosasea was going crazy. It worked out so well that I wanted to see if they had something for everyday wear. I LOVE how smooth &amp; creamy this is. The skin on my body is fairly dry &amp; this lotion is perfect for it.</li>
    <li> I love this product I&#x27;ve been using it for 15 years. This first time ordering through Amazon and having it delivered. One of the two bottles I ordered had opened and the lotion leaked out into the box. There needs to be more attention to packaging the order.</li>
    <li> Awesome lotion if your putting it on before bed and definitely hydrated the skin, but it leaves your skin very greasy if worn during the day. It&#x27;s very uncomfortable to feel like your wearing vegetable oil all day 😤 I purchased to make lotions with my essential oils because it is unscented and has a good reputation, but I won&#x27;t buy again. Would be great for massages if your going to bathe right after.</li>
    <li> This is a long-time fave of mine.  I keep it by my couch and each time I sit down I slather some on.  It has been the only product that I have found to keep my hands from cracking all over.  I also put a good amount on my hands before bed.  It soaks in in a matter of seconds, which is a major plus.  And no scent is the only way I will wear it.  The rest of my skin doesn&#x27;t usually need this intense amount of treatment, but it works great wherever you need it.</li>
    <li> My skin is very dry, and this lotion has been perfect for me. I am also sensitive to smells, so the unscented feature is a HUGE bonus. I buy the 32-oz each time, and feel like it lasts forever!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, hands down best stuff I&#x27;ve found. Its perfect all year round, I use it on my entire family- even my newborns.</li>
    <li> This lotion is wonderful and at a great price. I have been looking for an unscented lotion without parabens and sulfates and I finally found the best product. I would highly recommend this lotion to everyone.</li>
    <li> The item is great, but Amazons packing leaves much to be desired! I received this tried-and-true product with the top completely open in the contents smeared all around the inside of the box. There are many other vendors selling this item and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be back to Amazon for it any time soon.</li>
    <li> I am straying away from fragrance because it has alcohol in it and this disrupts the surface of my skin, although it is not their most emollient lotion it penetrates well and continues to moisturize naturally and perfectly.</li>
    <li> My skin has become so smooth and soft since I started using this lotion. It is not greasy or heavy. I have tried many other lotions throughout my life. No need to look any further. This is the best hands down.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, will continue to order it.  Be careful with the packaging, the contents often leak out.  They wrap it in plastic but it doesn&#x27;t always help.</li>
    <li> I am in loveeeeeee with this lotion. I like the no scent. Super soft. Soaks in quickly. Not to grease.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the lotion but it arrived damaged. The top was leaking and the pump doesn&#x27;t work. I would send it back but my son has such eczema flare ups right now I don&#x27;t want to wait to replace it.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and I always had to use Cetaphil, but this has become my new favorite. It is not filled with chemicals, and this unscented version is perfect. Rich, hydrating, and not sticky or greasy at all.</li>
    <li> I have a tough time finding lotions that fit my criteria: must moisturize, must be unscented, must absorb, must soften, must not leave a greasy feeling.  I have finally found the perfect lotion and it Alba Botanica.  It is very light but effective and truly unscented rather than something that is simply \\&quot;neutrally\\&quot; scented.  My skin drinks it up very easily.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. All lotion should come in a gigantic bottle like this, with a fabulous pump. Alba makes it easy to moisturize with this product. My local Natural Grocer ran a sale on this big bottle for about $12 and I bought 10 bottles at the time. I do use other lotions, too, but I have to say this one in a good main stay. No oder. It absorbs fast, no residue to speak of, it def moisturized. I&#x27;m happy. Like I said, I bought 10 bottles and now I&#x27;m down to 2. I plan to restock. This lotion is a winner!</li>
    <li> Use this to blend essential oils with. Great product!</li>
    <li> It is the only lotion that I use now.  It lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy nor does it stain your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Alba.</li>
    <li> Great but the pump doesn&#x27;t work.I put in lavender oil and use it every night.</li>
    <li> I dont like scented lotions... imagine whiffing fake apple all day... ugh.  This lotion is scent free and works great on dry skin, of which I have plenty of over here in the Southwest.</li>
    <li> Fast and easy transaction.  Great product.  Great for gluten free users.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> very moisturizing without any irritating scent.  Not oily or flaky.  Really the perfect lotion.  This is at least the 20th bottle I have bought.</li>
    <li> Love alba products, this lotion is the perfect consistency, not too thick and not too thin.  I have very dry skin and this does the trick and it goes a long way, one bottle lasts me about 6 months.</li>
    <li> Great lotion with no bad stuff in the ingredients.  I love the fresh smell and they way it feels on my skin. Really nice lotion at a great price!</li>
    <li> Beware, if there is one thing I hate, it&#x27;s when the pump doesn&#x27;t work. You buy lotion, get it home, and you can&#x27;t use it because the pump doesn&#x27;t function. I turned and turned in the direction that read &amp;#34;open&amp;#34; and....nothing.  Now I&#x27;ve got a big bottle of lotion that I have to transfer to another brands&#x27;s bottle. It&#x27;s similar to buy really nice lotions at discounted stores like Ross, TJ Max, etc, BEWARE, the pump never works!</li>
    <li> I always look for safe lotion for my dry skin and found this. ALL real natural and no bad chemicals like any parabans.&lt;br /&gt;Worked awesome for after sun to keep my skin from pealing too.  Large bottle, no bad smell, and not too thick.</li>
    <li> The packaging needs to be changed.  A lid was cracked and the lotion spilled into the plastic  bag that it was in.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!  I try to only use ethical products which can be hit and miss sometimes; this lotion is an occasion where it&#x27;s now my go-to product.  It is thin and rubs in quickly, and leaves my skin hydrated and soft.</li>
    <li> This lotion is fabulous</li>
    <li> This lotion came in promptly and packaged well. I like it very much. It goes on easily and absorbs well. I especially like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of additives. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> the best lotion I have ever used. My baby&#x27;s skin looks great and she is free from eczema. I would recommend it for every baby!!!</li>
    <li> This is a lotion that I have used for a long time. I use it for myself and my kids. It is unscented and I really like that and it keeps my skin soft but not greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion as a natural alternative to my philosophy products, since finding out I was pregnant.  I feel good about the ingredients but the lotion takes a long time to absorb. It leaves my body feeling sticky. Overall though, it does a great job of moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I live in the desert southwest and this is the best product I&#x27;ve found to keep my skin moist in this dry climate.</li>
    <li> I have people all the time ask me what hand lotion I use.  I then give them a gift of Alba Botanica Very Emollient Body Lotion.  I was out one time and was using other lotions I had around the house and couldn&#x27;t figure out why my hands didn&#x27;t feel right.  Wow...I wasn&#x27;t using Alba.  I will never go without it again.  I also use it on my face..works great there also.  The scented smells good but then I couldn&#x27;t use it on my face.</li>
    <li> I would love this product even if it wasn&#x27;t natural and not tested on animals.  The fact that it is those things makes me absolutely, freakin&#x27; love this product.  It moisturizes well without leaving any kind of greasy feeling behind.  It&#x27;s actually unscented...versus those ones that say they&#x27;re unscented, but actually have a faint, odd smell to them.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing for sensitive, dry skin.  I use it after every shower on myself, my 4 year old daughter who has eczema, my 13 year old son who has psoriasis, and my 2 month old baby.  It holds moisture very well and has no smell at all.  I love that it comes in a huge bottle with the pump because it makes it very convenient to just walk by it and put some on throughout the day.  During my pregnancy I developed keratosis pilaris on my upper arms and within about two weeks of using this lotion (in conjunction with Alba Botanica Island Citrus Very Emollient Bath &amp; Shower Gel) it has cleared up completely.</li>
    <li> Came quickly and the lotion is awesome.</li>
    <li> Been using this lotion for about 6 months now and am entirely pleased. The entire family uses it now as well with zero complaints. My skin is also noticeably smoother. Price is cheaper here on Amazon than store I normally purchase from, so will not make that mistake again.</li>
    <li> Pump arrived broken.  But since we needed the lotion we just dumped it out of the bottle into our hands when we needed it.</li>
    <li> Great lotion. Goes on smooth and is non greasy</li>
    <li> Labeling this product as &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; is a little misleading - the lotion has a very light, but pleasant fragrance. Regardless, this is my go-to lotion. I smooth it on after a shower, shaving, or throughout the day. It&#x27;s super softening and doesn&#x27;t leave a film on your skin.</li>
    <li> When I was going to physical theraphy for my hand, this is what they used and I fell in love with it. They also have a scented lotion.</li>
    <li> My new favorite body lotion.  Goes on smooth and soaks in right away!  Lasts all day long too!</li>
    <li> I like this lotion for it&#x27;s natural ingredients. It&#x27;s a good everyday lotion, provides moisture but it&#x27;s not super-hydrating like I thought it would be. I guess that makes sense since the 1st listed ingredient is water. Still, it&#x27;s good for daily use and I&#x27;m liking it so far - will probably order again.</li>
    <li> I would rate this as a medium intensity moisturizer -- not very heavy (such as Eucerin Smoothing Repair), nor too light.  It absorbs into my skin fairly quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or waxy residue.  That point is important in colder weather, as residues leave  my skin clammy and give me chills.  The price ($12+ for this large bottle) seems very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has some issues in packaging (the heavy weight of the bottle banging around in the box sometimes causes the purple spout to either leak or break), but if they can address this  (i.e. with a styrofoam or other sturdy guard for the spout), it&#x27;ll be perfect.  I need a daily moisturizer for my Psoriasis and this fits the bill for both the lesions and regular skin.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  I find it to be pretty much scentless.  And I&#x27;m very sensitive to scents.  I like the consistency of it too.  My skin is extremely dry, especially on the lower legs.  And it seems to do about the best job of any cream or lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Has less chemicals than other lotions and the unscented is great since scenting for me is often an irritant.</li>
    <li> My hands, elbows, and sometimes my arms get really dry. I purchased this lotion, because the price was good for the size, it&#x27;s unscented- so it won&#x27;t clash at all with any of the perfumes that I wear, and it says that it&#x27;s good for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I have been using this lotion for the last several months, and while I can say that the bottle has lasted me a very long time, I can&#x27;t say that the reasons for that are all good. This lotion seemed to be okay to use during the Summer, when my skin was naturally a little oily from the heat; but during the Fall and Winter seasons, this lotion just didn&#x27;t cut it for me at all. I have found myself going back to the lotion that I used to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep the remainder of the this Alba Botanica lotion to use on my legs when I need it, but I won&#x27;t repurchase it once I run out.</li>
    <li> I wanted something that would be good for dry skin without any scent. This is my go to lotion. It isn&#x27;t too thick but does the job and without any smell!</li>
    <li> Got 3 for what I paid for 1 in the store.  Great Deal!</li>
    <li> Unscented, and they mean it! I love this lotion; it is thick, creamy and lasts all day. And despite its thickness, it melts and soaks into skin immediately upon application. The price for the quantity is only an added bonus. I have finally found my hg lotion!</li>
    <li> Excellent Body Lotion. Creamy and Hydrating</li>
    <li> I really love this lotion. Alba did recently change the ingredients in the lotion and I do not like it quite as good as the original. But it is still better than any other lotion I have used.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Makes my skin feel amazing. Best I have ever used. Ordered the 32 oz, will be ordering the 128 oz next time around.</li>
    <li> Perfect moisturizer with no annoying smells and not greasy at all.  I noticed my skin condition has improved and I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> We need to use unscented lotion and this is great stuff. I have ordered it several times and will order it again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love love love this lotion!!!! I have really dry skin which requires me to use a pretty thick lotion. I believe this lotion works well on my skin because it is thick, but not greasy. It also works well to moisturize my skin for most of the day.</li>
    <li> I finally found a truly unscented organic lotion that works!  And I stumbled on it by accident at the grocery store of all places.  It is definitely &amp;#34;very emollient&amp;#34; so is a little greasy at first.  But within a few minutes it&#x27;s absorbed into the skin and for the first time in my life my skin stays soft for a long time, even over night.  So glad I found it.</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion. Delivery was perfect.</li>
    <li> I slather this on myself and my baby with no worries, and I love it that it is all natural.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I have been using it daily for the past two years and it works perfectly for my skin. I live in a dry climate and lotion is an absolute necessity. It&#x27;s not oily and it absorbs quickly. It keeps my skin feeling soft and smooth. I tried several other natural lotions before this one and for the money this one is hands down the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read the reviews about the broken pumps but I&#x27;ve never had an issue and I&#x27;d guess I&#x27;m on my ninth bottle.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time as it&#x27;s odorless and soaks right into the body with no oily sensation.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have dealt with eczema all of my life and find that using lotion after bathing is the best way to prevent it from flaring up. With other lotions, I&#x27;ve still had issues, but never with Alba Botanica (unscented)--hopefully I haven&#x27;t jinxed myself. :) Honestly, I recommend this lotion to everyone. I love it and use it every day.</li>
    <li> creamy. I tried but cant detect ay odor. like putting healthy cream over my entire body. skin it a huge organ that doesn&#x27;t need added chemicals. worth a bit more money.</li>
    <li> This Brand of cream came highly recommended by another with sensitive skin, well it works beautifully leaving skin soft and hydrated without being heavy and oily.</li>
    <li> Great unscented lotion for sensitive skin. It&#x27;s thick enough to moisturize, but isn&#x27;t hard to apply. My skin is only dry when the weather is dry. But, wow does it keep the itch away! I will continue to buy this lotion.</li>
    <li> Love Alba products.  My skin feels soft and moisturized after use.  No smell which is a plus.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! This is as close as I have found to a lotion with natural ingredients that can be used on body and face. Good size that lasts a long time and best price too!</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of lotions and this has been the best in eliminating dry skin.  Really great body lotion!</li>
    <li> So sticky! If you dislike glycerine lotions, give this one a miss. Feels like rubbing rose water on the skin. Horrid.</li>
    <li> Great product, very nice feel on dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Does not have a heavy scent.  Light scent, very pleasing.  Nurses station had it when husband was in the hospital.</li>
    <li> This is a thick, rich lotion exactly what I wanted it to be. I love the large size for my whole family to use. The pump dispenser makes it very convenient and no mess. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have very sensitive skin and it works great for me. Non- greasy and smooth feeling. So good on legs after shaving too. A must for all who care about their skin.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer....works well for mousturizing body. It is very emollient and absorbs well. I also like that it is organic and has no perfumes or dyes.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. Not greasy. Great for dry skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years and am very satisfied</li>
    <li> Great price, great lotion, great ingredients.  Really softens skin and truly unscented.  Also, got a great price here.</li>
    <li> Least amount of bad ingredients of any lotion I can find that still works. HIghly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love the lotion. Light natural smell. Not greasy, can be used all over.</li>
    <li> Very light and scent free. Good price too.</li>
    <li> No odors and goes on nicely.  Absorbs quickly and lasts all day, even in my cold Wisconsin weather.  I used to use Eucerin and now proudly use this to feel better about what I&#x27;m putting on my skin and into my body.  I will buy again for sure!</li>
    <li> I had a rush from this product</li>
    <li> I use this lotion every day. It absorbs well and really keeps my skin moisturized. It also mixes well with other body oils. It&#x27;s non irritating and is definitely my go to. Been using it for about three years now.</li>
    <li> have used for years. not completely free of chemicals but much better than typical drug store products</li>
    <li> this is the best lotion and so good for your skin</li>
    <li> I use this lotion on my face as well as my body.  It is wonderful.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for in a lotion. It moisturized deeply without feeling greasy and has no parabens. Im very happy!!</li>
    <li> We love Alba&#x27;s lotion because it is scent free, priced very affordably and is thick and smooth.  We have used it for years and will continue to use it because it has no harmful ingredients.</li>
    <li> This is my current favorite overall body lotion.  I like that it&#x27;s unscented so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with my hand lotion, which is usually reserved for a bath and body scented lotion.  Provides adequate moisture without feeling greasy all day and I like the big bottles.  I don&#x27;t buy anything else for body lotion.</li>
    <li> Great feel. Not greasy. Very moisturizing. Read some reviews saying that the lotion smelled really bad, but for me, the smell is not a bother.  I notice a faint unidentifiable smell, but it is not overwhelming for me.  Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This provided a very nice moisturizer without any scent.  It helped to take care of some rough patches on my arm that had appeared as a result of the winter.  I highly recommend it! I have sensitive skin and have had no problems with this lotion.  I use it nightly.</li>
    <li> Great for dry skin,odorless and  easylly absorbed bythe skin.</li>
    <li> There are some users who never had the chance to experience the Alba original formula lotion.  those people they think that the lotion is great because they don&#x27;t know any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, those people should compare the ingredients listed on this website to the ingredients on your bottle.  There is a huge difference because Amazon still lists the original ingredients.  The alleged new and improved formula has many other additives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever they added to the formula made the lotion the consistancy of Crisco Shortening and leave a sticky residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this lotion for 15 years so I purchased several bottles of the new and improved forumla from Whole Foods.  I rotate my stock so I didn&#x27;t get around to using the new formula until 4 months after purchase.  That is when to my horror that they had changed the formula and not for the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Hain Celestial to express my disappointment and to request a refund for the unopened, unused bottles that I still had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First they told me that they couldn&#x27;t give me a refund without a receipt.  I told them even if I still had the receipt even a store with the most generous return return policy will not accept a 4 month old receipt.  I asked to speak to a manager then they told me that I would have to pay for shipping and they would only refund me 50% of what I paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This means that I pay $15 they refund me $7.50 and resell it for $15 so they make a $22.50 profit off of each bottle that I return.  Mind you they would not accept the bottle that I opened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully Whole Foods will take them back and give me store credit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hain Celestial does not stand by their products so I will never purchase a product from this company again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several decades and I think this is one of the best body lotions of all time and you cannot beat the price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My family has been luxuriating in this chemical and scent-free cream for the last few years. It&#x27;s the safest &#x27;soft&#x27; under the sun in my opinion. Also, ridculously well-priced for the quality and quantity, although have bought for less on vitamin sites. Wouldn&#x27;t be without it!</li>
    <li> Even after one use my skin felt softer! At first it feels like there is sort of a residue on your skin and the fragrance isn&#x27;t spectacular (it says &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; but it definitely has a scent...). Despite those drawbacks I would still give this 5 stars. I bought it to moisturize my skin and that is exactly what it did. I don&#x27;t use it daily because I feel like I don&#x27;t need to. This size bottle will last a very long time.</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizer and a great price for this size. Alba makes some good products.</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion. Been using for years.</li>
    <li> We love this Unscented lotion from Alba Botanica and keep it on tap year round, so we&#x27;re grateful for the Prime free shipping.  So difficult to find lotion without mineral oil and all the added chemicals.  We&#x27;ve had no allergic reaction to this and are especially glad it is unscented.  Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> This a great everyday lotion.  Have used it for years...not greasy, not sticky, very nice.</li>
    <li> We love the lotions. My Sister-in-Law is very allergic to smells. I gave her a bottle of the unscented  and she loves it.  We love the moisture that it has.  The best lotion we have ever used.</li>
    <li> I adore Alba products, but this one is especially wonderful. The lotion goes on so smoothly and you notice such a difference in the suppleness of your skin right away. I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> The texture and quality of this lotion is superior to most lotions, hypoallergenic or scented.  I tried many and always find myself coming back to this one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. I wanted it without added perfumes, etc., but I find I wouldn&#x27;t mind a better smell -- from essential oil, perhaps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. A good basic moisturizer and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> 5 stars for the lotion, 1 star for delivery.  I should have listened to the reviewer who said their lotion had leaked.  It was a mess - it leaked all over the bag it was in, and I lost an inch or more of product.  Also, the pump is broken - id doesn&#x27;t work and there&#x27;s a rattle when I shake the bottle.  I&#x27;ve ordered tubes of lotion before and never had a problem, so maybe it&#x27;s the change in air pressures when it&#x27;s shipped. I won&#x27;t order it on-line again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the lotion for years, and it is the best thing I&#x27;ve found for my sensitive dry skin.  I have allergies and react badly to fragrances, so I like the fact that it&#x27;s unscented.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that Alba doesn&#x27;t put any expiration or manufacture dates on their products, and I have had lotion go bad - evidently the store had the lotion on the shelves a really long time.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and it itch. I cannot use most lotions. The Alba Botanica very emollient lotion is the best for a person suffering with dry itchy skin.</li>
    <li> I bought my first bottle of this lotion today on sale. I was excited to try it so after my shower I applied on my arms and legs. Several readers commented that the \\&quot;old\\&quot; formula was better. Since I am using it for the first time-which is why I have nothing to compare it to. I gave it 3 stars because of the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;not greasy&lt;br /&gt;abosorbs quickly&lt;br /&gt;skin feels soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;it does have a faint scent that is a little different than other lotions I have used before. I don&#x27;t think it is a \\&quot;bad\\&quot; odor however it is noticeable. I am hoping it loses all the scent by morning or I will have to take another shower before I go to work. I am 100 % certain I don&#x27;t want to smell it all day. I have had it on about an hour so far and the odor hasn&#x27;t lessened at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I bought it on sale I have no way of knowing if the odor is because the expiration date has come and gone or if it supposed to smell the way it does. I hope other organic lotions that I plan to try smell better. This bottle is going in the trash because the odor is annoying. I would not recommend this lotion to anyone!</li>
    <li> Best lotion at best price.  I put this on after a shower and have smooth skin all day.</li>
    <li> Perfect for foot massage</li>
    <li> great size option. really is unscented! absorbs easily, non-greasy. I have been using this product for a few years now and always get a good price on amazon.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it because it doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well as the Alba Botanical Natural Hawaiian Cocoa Butter Hand and Body Lotion.  I couldn&#x27;t afford the shipping on that though, so I tried this one.  No, I would not recommend it.  My daughter tried this too and she didn&#x27;t like it either.</li>
    <li> Very good product to use after showering!</li>
    <li> I never used this line before, so I&#x27;m not real sure about other reviewers complaints regarding changes in the formula. I love this lotion! I follow it with Ahava dry oil &amp; my skin feels like pure silk. I will buy this again and again. It&#x27;s been a life saver for my dry skin!</li>
    <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried. Makes my skin feel amazing just after the first time of using</li>
    <li> Great brand and received quickly.  Great organic product to buy for those who have allergies.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion a bit ago and really liked it for dry skin issues.  Just this week I started using a small amount on my hair after it dries.  Since being diagnosed with an autoimmune disease (it causes the destruction of hair follicles) four years ago, I have tried EVERY hair preparation under the sun and also creams for the face and skin (some were extremely pricey!).  Unfortunately, they did nothing but make it look worse.  The argan oil products have helped some but NOTHING has smoothed my hair especially in the back as much as this lotion.  I don&#x27;t know if it is because it contains less chemicals than the others I have tried that makes the difference; but I do know that I will continue to use this product hopefully for the rest of my life.  Please do not stop manufacturing this.  If this helps just one person to feel a tiny bit better about their appearance, then I am so glad I reviewed Alba Botanica.</li>
    <li> I am a lover of all the Alba Botanica products. This one is great for healing my dry skin in the winter months, however when I received this product it looked as if though more than a fifth of the product was missing. That&#x27;s about 5 ounces gone! There was also dried lotion allover the outside of the bottle so it had clearly been tampered with. This seems very unsanitary and unprofessional. How can Amazon sell products with some of the item taken out???</li>
    <li> This is very nice lotion.  It absorbs well and is non greasy.</li>
    <li> Excellent product n service</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have bought many organic body lotions before and they are usually so thin and watery - this one is nice and thick and you don&#x27;t need a lot....i will buy again.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion a lot. But when I got it, the bottle was opened and quite a bit was missing. That&#x27;s not cool, because the description said this was new. Oh well, even if it was a tester, the lotion smells nice and does not feel greasy. I really like this because it also is not overly scented.</li>
    <li> Best lotion I have ever used….and I have used them all.  Not oily, can be scent free, and keeps my dry skin moist and looking great.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both love this moisturizer. I put a portion in a separate container and add lavender essential oil for times when I want a little fragrance.</li>
    <li> This lotion clogged up my sensitive skin to the point where I got a terrible terrible rash! I thought it was my detergent or something else I had suddenly gotten allergic to for no reason, i even went to the doctor because i broke out in hives! I am normally not allergic to anything. Now i hve scars from where the rash was...it was definitely the lotion because then I took a trip for a month away and didn&#x27;t use this lotion and the rash stopped! I thoight it was just the soft water or something in the air. When I came home, and started using this lotion again,  the rash started again!&lt;br /&gt;The other long time users of this product are RIGHT its changed and the ingredients cause terrible skin reactioms over time. I am otherwise a very healthy person, this really caused me s lot of anxiety and money and stress! You might as well use some jergens because that would be more natural than this junk!  I&#x27;m not the only one of their customers to notice this new formula is full of bad stuff. Don&#x27;t Buy this!!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion.  I will definitely buy it again.  I only have to use this once a day, or every other day if I skip a shower.  Most of the regular name brand lotions I have to constantly put on more and more.  It&#x27;s a nice consistency.  Thick enough, but not too thick.  Soaks in well.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect a pretty smell; it doesn&#x27;t smell at all, which means it&#x27;s a healthier product.  It does the job in a safe way.</li>
    <li> Goes on well, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky. Been great on my skin this winter!</li>
    <li> Emollient without being greasy.  No poisons, either!</li>
    <li> The more I use this product the more pleased I am.  The applicator provides an overly generous squirt, however.  I&#x27;m planning to order more soon as mine is running out despite the large container.</li>
    <li> The lotion itself is fine - meets expectations, which is why it gets the 3 stars. Unfortunately, when the package arrived, the bottle was open. The container was damaged and there was lotion everywhere.Not sure whether it is a product issue or delivery/packaging issue, but since the item is not eligible for return, I&#x27;m stuck with a broken bottle, missing lotion and a mess. Definitely disappointed .</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I hate perfumed products and this really only smells of the oils used. Used right after showering it prevents my dryness eczema reliably. Unfortunately, without preservatives, mine usually goes rancid, before I can use up such a large bottle, but the smaller bottle is hard to find/much more expensive here on Amazon. It&#x27;s still a very good deal.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this product through a woman that I know from church.  Her sister had sent her a bottle.  I can&#x27;t tell you how wonderful my skin feels...The moisture last for hours.  I would recommend this product to everyone!  The vendor was prompt, the order was filled correctly.  I&#x27;d use this vendor again.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion that goes on smooth, no scent if you are very sensitive and very affordable price!</li>
    <li> still has a smell i can&#x27;t make out what it is but it does have a smell. No matter, its very nice and soft for my skin so over all happy with it :)</li>
    <li> smells a little but like playdough but feels great</li>
    <li> A very good moisturizer without unnecessary chemicals and fragrance.  I have very sensitive skin and have used this for about a year without problems.</li>
    <li> Beware!  I found that a little of this lotion goes a long way!  I slathered it on as I&#x27;d done with previous lotions &amp; was not happy with the way it did not absorb.  Then I decided to try using a smaller amount &amp; that did the trick!  When used sparingly it absorbs quickly and is in no way greasy. I use each night and in the morning my skin is still hydrated--not tight and dry.  Another advantage is that it is truly unscented!  Both my hubby  &amp; I can&#x27;t tolerate most scents so this is perfect.  Winter&#x27;s coming and where we live in New Mexico the climate is excessively dry so hopefully this will help alleviate the tight dry skin during the winter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for several years and find that it is better than all of the others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;I love it and am pleased to find it at a better price than elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I hate hand lotion that is too oily or leaves a lot of residue.  This one is just the right balance.  After thoroughly rubbing it in and waiting a little while nearly all of it is absorbed and I&#x27;m not slickening up door nobs or anything else I touch around the house all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hands get very dry from washing dishes and surfing often and are perfectly restored with this product.  Very happy, I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
    <li> not terribly impressed...doesn&#x27;t seem like it absorbs into my very dry skin very well...probably won&#x27;t buy again after it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> Great price wonderful cream.  My husband loves it too.</li>
    <li> Great product smells wonderful</li>
    <li> Great lotion!  This is a super value, there is no smell and it leaves my skin very soft and moisturized.  I like to use this and then follow up with my expensive perfume matching lotion in a few key areas.  This way I get to save my expensive lotion and still be nice and soft!</li>
    <li> After trying many lotions that are natural and absent of harmful chemicals, my skin has been left dry and lacking moisture. This lotion helped to restore moisture to my skin and I have a healthy glow again. Does not leave behind a heavy residue. Our entire family uses it, including our 2 toddlers. Excellent product!!</li>
    <li> Often times, Men do not like the scent of lotion.  I can tell you this lotion is not scented.  Great for dry, sensitive skin.  As this product is all natural, it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
    <li> Truth in advertising: this lotion is very emollient as promised. Also it does not irritate my sensitive skin. It&#x27;s great for use year round - even when you get the winter dry patches.</li>
    <li> Great body wash.  No harsh chemicals and no allergy concerns</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for years and it is the best one I&#x27;ve tried for my extremely dry skin.</li>
    <li> This product feels waxy and gross, and it clogged my pores (causing pimples to form on my body). I looked at the ingredients and noticed dimethicone is pretty high up on the list. That&#x27;s really disappointing, since there are a lot of botanical alternatives to dimethicone they could use...</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion. I&#x27;ve tried many different natural lotions and most have a wired smell but the unscented Alba lotion is great. Thick and absorbent, not greasy. great for our dry Colorado climate.</li>
    <li> This review is for Alba Botanica Natural Very Emollient body lotion, original unscented. The ingredient list on the Amazon website for this product is not correct. I had been buying this product from the grocery store for years, so I already knew that it had no parabens (the price here on Amazon is much better). If I had only just read the ingredients on the Amazon website without knowing the ingredients, I never would have bought it! It does not contain any parabens, phthalates, sodiium lauryl/laureth sulfate or sodium methyl sulfate. It does however contain phenoxyethanol as the very last ingredient. I wish it wasn&#x27;t an ingredient in this product, but, as with all of my food and cosmetics, I have to balance avoiding chemicals wherever possible with cost effectiveness. In this case I am hoping that the amount of pheoxyethanol is very small. The bottle is huge, the price is right and the lotion works very well with no scent, and just the right amount of moisture. It absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel on your skin.</li>
    <li> Winter months are starting here in Colorado, always have issues with really try itchy skin.  So far this lotion has been doing the trick, isn&#x27;t heavy and absorbs quickly.  Love that it doesn&#x27;t contain any parabens are harmful chemicals.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product! Not greasy, soaks in quickly, and works insranyly. A massage therapist suggested this product to me about 4 years ago. Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. Apply on face too for great overnite moisturizing..  Good for sensitive skin as well. Massage it into your skin. Great !</li>
    <li> Nothing beats this lotion. It&#x27;s extremely light as it is extremely moisturizing. Leaves skin noticeably softer! Light enough for face.</li>
    <li> Best for dry skin, no smell, smoother skin.</li>
    <li> Soft, wonderful skin.  This is the best lotion ever!  I love it!</li>
    <li> This lotion, recommended by my daughter, does a wonderful job at the one thing that has been problematic, dry skin on limbs in winter. Use it after showering every day.</li>
    <li> The lotion is wonderful, very moisturizing and absorbs quickly.  I would have given it 5 starts if the pump would work.  We cannot get it out of the locked mode.  I&#x27;ve tried, my husband, our son...none of us can get it to work.</li>
    <li> Use this everyday &amp; now turned my Mom onto it. She is DELIGHTED!</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this stuff, not oily or greasy on application, does not trigger allergies, and leaves the skin just right she tells me.</li>
    <li> Alba Botanica is great for dry skin - we live in the AZ desert, so it is much appreciated and used frequently.</li>
    <li> Good lotion for the whole family. We have dry cracking thumbs in the winter---put this on before bed and have seen&lt;br /&gt;an immense improvement.  I like an unscented product and this is very quickly absorbed , non greasy and luxurious feeling.</li>
    <li> Great body lotion.  I have many allergies and have found I have no problems with this product.  I would recommend this product to any one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, I love it.  Thick enough for my dry skin, but not so much that it is greasy.  I bought this for my Mom who loved it too.</li>
    <li> Buy this if you want something unscented that will leave your skin baby soft instantly! And inexpensive is a bonus.</li>
    <li> This product is one of the greater ingredient brands out there. The lotions has low viscosity, so I was unsure if this very liquidy lotion would soak in, or do anything for my skin. It did soak in, and works wonderfully for the dry skin that happens in cold climates where the house drops to 17% humidity. After reading research on the many cancer causing chemicals in lotions, as well as other products, this was the safest ine I found that worked, doesn&#x27;t smell offensive, and is on the less expensive side. I have ordered this product twice and it was great both times.</li>
    <li> I love this cream, no sent and you can put your own essential oil in it.  Great</li>
    <li> The best!  Soaks right into the skin.  No strong odors.  Have used this lotion for years and years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year and I really like it.  It gets absorbed nicely.  When I put it on my face, I add a little olive oil or coconut oil</li>
    <li> This stuff is actually pretty good for my hands. I have eczema and extremely sensitive skin on hands and no problems with this lotion.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great for my very dry skin. I am very sensitive to strong scents, so the I scented is good although my husband complains it smell like oil after using this.</li>
    <li> Great lotion free of the junk you don&#x27;t  need. Good price here too.</li>
    <li> This is great lotion. Doesn&#x27;t go on greasy but is a thick moisturizer without all the bad stuff. Is three times the amount of the last product I use to use but five dollars cheaper. I bought this at Target for 15 and I realize it is cheaper here so I will buy online from now on. Only problem is this bottle is super fragile. I bought it got home and the top was already broken somehow which has never happened to me with anything else I have ever bought at a store.</li>
    <li> V good cream, not that oily, unlike some other cream that I have tried previously&lt;br /&gt;Excellent value of money, with a big bottle</li>
    <li> This stuff is my new favorite jam!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not enjoy using lotions, mostly because even the unscented stuff has an oatmealy smell to it that makes my allergies stand up and say &amp;#34;do not like!&amp;#34;.  There&#x27;s also that &amp;#34;I swear I put this stuff on to soak into my skin, not my clothes&amp;#34; factor that comes with other lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy to report, this does neither of the above!  If you&#x27;re super &amp;#34;scentsitive&amp;#34; this is your stuff!  I put it on once a day and don&#x27;t need to for the rest of the day.  Sometimes I do though, just because I enjoy the moisturized feeling it provides, without all that oily mess to go along with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is truly unscented too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve run the gamut on organic unscented lotions and this one is a keeper.  I paid a boatload for it at a local store, because once I tried it at the store, I knew I&#x27;d be disappointed if I didn&#x27;t bring it home that day.  Save yourself the drive and order it here to save some coin.</li>
    <li> The lotion is fine, but the pump doesn&#x27;t work at all, which makes this product far less effective.  And to find that there is no return/replace policy....I don&#x27;t plan on buying this product again.</li>
    <li> I used to love this product.  I used it for a very long time, because it was completely fragrance free.  The formula has now changed, and it is listed as unscented, but it is not unscented.  I would describe it more as an ODOR than a scent though.  Very very disappointed.  I will be finding a new body lotion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved alba and this lotion reminds me why. I love the way it feels but most of all I love that it leaves my skin moisturized all day. I live in a really dry climate and this is the best lotion I&#x27;ve used so far. Its truly unscented so I can use it all over my body and not be all smelly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for several years now, and it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ll use. No scent. Keeps my skin soft.</li>
    <li> Really good lotion for the dry Alaskan Arctic winters</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  Very light, but very effective. I use it everywhere.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin and have searched for YEARS to find a lotion that would actually do something besides soak into my skin with no evidence of moisture whatsoever. I had finally hit on the Triple Moisture Body Cream by Bath and Body Works, which totally did the trick. It was a bit pricey, but worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;Well...that was great until I recently met and became good friends with someone with chemical sensitivities and I had to stop using my B&amp;BW body cream as the scents made her very ill. I really didn&#x27;t hold out much hope of finding anything else that would work so well, but I started doing some research on unscented, fragrance-free lotions and came across some promising reviews of Alba Botanical Very Emollient Body Lotion. I decided to give it a try...and I love, love, LOVE it! It works every bit as well as B&amp;BW Triple Moisture Body Cream, and for a lot less money!!&lt;br /&gt;If you, or a friend have problems with chemical sensitivities, you have to give this lotion a try...Im sure you will love it as much as I do!</li>
    <li> Very lightweight and absorbs quickly.  Love that it is unscented.</li>
    <li> Great product and was delivered ahead of schedule.</li>
    <li> Cruelty free, fragrance free. Just what my sensitive skin needed. Thick and absorbs quickly ! I&#x27;m loving the alba line and adding products because they do the job and don&#x27;t irritate!</li>
    <li> My sister-in-laws came to visit with this lotion and I just fell in love with it!  I have it on my Subscribe and Save now and won&#x27;t go without it.  Not greasy, great conditioner for dry hands and just love it</li>
    <li> I like it because it is not greasy it doesn&#x27;t have a smell and it is not as heavy as some other lotions I have previously used. I have moderate to dry skin and I put it on my body after I shower and it last all day.  I learned about it through a massage I had where the person used it on me.</li>
    <li> Nice all over conditioning for flakey skin, stops the shedding.</li>
    <li> This is very inexpensive for the quality you receive, great for winter and summer. Helped me with my psoriasis spots.</li>
    <li> This is a great daily moisturizer. I have sensitive skin and it does not irritate it. The formula also isn&#x27;t too thick and absorbs in the skin well. Going to repurchase.</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion of all time!</li>
    <li> I like this lotion because it is all natural, but it does go on opaque and a little thick.  You have to rub it in for some time before the white color goes away.  Other than that, the price is reasonable and I would buy it again.  there are not very many choices for natural lotions.  This one is a good value and is good enough.</li>
    <li> the product meet my expectations</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use any other brand of lotion on my body...it&#x27;s a great product.  This is a good value, as it has natural ingredients, and a silky smooth feel that hydrates my skin.  There is no offensive odor.  I also find it&#x27;s less expensive to buy through Amazon, than in the stores.  This one&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
    <li> Even after using expensive, organic, and artisan made lotions, I always end up coming back to this amazing stuff. I even use it on my face. Definitely my favorite.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for years and I love it. Free of parables, and it soothes and moisterizes my sensitive skin well.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this size in particular i actually bought a gallon size of it, because this lotion is simply the best. I have fairly dry skin, it&#x27;s worse in the winter months where my legs get ashy and dry and this stuff works miracles. And for years i have suffered from Dyshidrotic eczema which is \\&quot; a condition in which small blisters develop on the hands and feet. Blisters are often itchy.\\&quot; Now it doesn&#x27;t heal them r make them go away, all this lotion does is moisturize my skin without irritating them, so if my hands are moisturized and not irritated my eczema doesn&#x27;t show up as much, There is no cure for it as for as I know, but all I can tell you is my outbreaks have lessened, and the severity of them are lessened. Regular scented lotion would irritate my skin and make it flare up. This prevents it, cause it is gentle to my skin. This product is definitely a must have it&#x27;s the perfect texture not too creamy not to light. I highly recommend this for anyone from normal skin to dry skin.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both have very dry skin and we both love this product.  It work quite well on any area of the body that is afflicted by dry skin.  We won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Great lotion!  Feels clean, never greasy. Leaves dry skin feeling soft. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this body lotion!  Absorbs quickly / no perfumey scents / no animal testing!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I needed something hypoallergenic that didn&#x27;t make my eyes burn..... It makes my eyes burn....</li>
    <li> Love this product but the pump was all broken up when I got it :( so now I have to tip it out to get the lotion.</li>
    <li> i used to live in Santa Fe, NM, which is located in a high desert. not only is it incredibly dry, but in the winter it gets very cold. alba kept my skin hydrated without being greasy. also, unlike many &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; lotions that actually smell a bit foul, the alba unscented simply smells clean.</li>
    <li> I like the lotion, it had a mild smell and feels nice on  my skin. It&#x27;s thick but doesn&#x27;t take too long to work in. However, the pump never worked so I have to unscrew the pump and wipe off the lotion on my hands which is rather cumbersome.  This is on my Save and Subscribe list so hopefully the next one on will work just fine, then I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
