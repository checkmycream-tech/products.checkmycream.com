    <li> This shampoo help my keratin treatment last longer. I like it !!</li>
    <li> I had an Alfaparf Lisse Smoothing Treatment and this shampoo is made specifically to be used with the product so your treatment will last longer. Just cleans, doesn&#x27;t strip hair of oils.</li>
    <li> Great product for Keratin treated hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo, if the original product, is great for keratin treated hair. Yet, if you purchase it from seller called &amp;#34;Just Ultimate Discounts &amp;#34;, you will get a diluted water like product, which is nowhere close to what the manufacturer produced. I am very disappointed in my last purchase and quite worried that the product I received may be not only diluted but fake altogether.</li>
    <li> I meet all my espectations about this product, not only the shampoo but also the conditioner.  Because it is heavy chemicals free my hair don&#x27;t suffer from caustic or sulfur.  Don&#x27;t damage hair color or keratin treatments.  Keeps my hair soft, shiny and healthy.</li>
    <li> Perfect in maintaining my keratin therapy treatment. Cleanses hair and smells good too.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed as I transition from relaxer to natural (kinky) hair. Excellent in combination with the mask from the same line and silicon mix liso sedoso intensive leave in.</li>
