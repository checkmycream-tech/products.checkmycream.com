    <li> I am a professional makeup artist and I received a set of bdellium brushes as a gift.  These brushes are really nice.  They are soft and strong, and the makeup application is nice.  The price is very affordable.  I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> Great quality crease brush. Premium quality... very soft bristles and a great blending brush.</li>
    <li> TThis brush is an awesome product. It Is made of quality materials and it handles with ease. It works just as well as the over priced high end cosmetic brushes. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this brush instead of paying $30 for a brush that will yield the exact look.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a brush that mimicked the MAC 222, and I saw someone on YouTube mention this particular brush, so of course I immediately found it on Amazon. Well this brush did not disappoint.  It&#x27;s an excellent crease brush that blends shadows very well. For $11, it&#x27;s a steal!</li>
    <li> I was kinda skeptical about this brush because they were not that many reviews for it. However being that it was so affordable I decided to give it a try. It is the perfect size crease brush for smaller eyes. It&#x27;s tapered and dense but it has enough fluff to blend or apply eyeshadow. The brush feels very sturdy and well constructed. The bristles are incredibly soft and I haven&#x27;t experienced any excessive shedding. This crease washed really well and there was no bleeding when I washed it. This brush was totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered several brushes from this line.  These are quality brushes that work just as well, if not better than over-priced department store brands.     The crease brush applies color exactly where you want and blends beautifully.</li>
    <li> Good quality, love this product. Crease brush is solid, easy to clean, very well made. I would definitely buy Bdellium Tools again.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing. It works just as good as MAC and sigma. I haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding and the price is also fantastic!</li>
    <li> It just okay, but again if you can find something cheaper than this price It would be good :) it&#x27;s still up to you..</li>
    <li> This is an excellent crease brush for smaller eyes.  It is dense and tapered to allow for precise placement of color in the crease, but is also full enough to allow for blending.  It is my go to crease brush. I have experienced no shedding. I recommend this brush and intend to purchase another at this price so that I have one for use with shimmer shadows and one for use with matte shadows.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I got this great of a quality at such a low price.  Definitely not the finest brush out there, but at this price there is not a single complaint coming from my mouth!</li>
    <li> i found out about this brand from youtube and its just as good as some of the high end brands. i will be repurchasing...</li>
    <li> I thought this was a line crease brush. The bristles are way too long and soft to be used for this purpose. Nice brush, but not a line crease brush.</li>
    <li> The bristles of this brush are so soft and it&#x27;s great for applying eyeshadow to the crease. I&#x27;ve washed this brush a couple times and have had no issues with bristles falling out. I love the long handle- it makes it much easier to use. I definitely recommend this brush</li>
    <li> This line of brushes are great!! You get good quality brushes without paying the high price of other name brand makeup brushes. I have started building my bdellium collection and find myself reaching for these brushes just as much as any other brand.</li>
    <li> I really love bdellium tools brushes, I first came across them at a makeup artist vent in Chicago and I bought a bunch.  I continue to purchase them because they are anti-microbial, they don&#x27;t shed, and the handle is durable.</li>
    <li> I really love the whole Bdellium brush line. The quality is outstanding and it picks up my products flawlessly. None of the brushes that I purchased have any issues with shedding or not applying my eyeshadows properly.</li>
