      <li>So I hoped the colors were brighter and more visible..</li>
      <li>Oh, one more thing, if you get glitter mascara to match each color (purple glitter with this purple mascara)</li>
      <li>you have too put so many times for you can see the lines.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I found these on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Love it...</li>
      <li>I love these.</li>
      <li>The Teal and purple are my favorite</li>
      <li>more like yucky paint that doesn&#x27;t stay where you put it.</li>
      <li>Pleased with this order.</li>
      <li>Will buy more.</li>
      <li>I love these colored mascaras.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>I love Benefit&#x27;s</li>
      <li>I have to order myself a set :)</li>
      <li>My lashes are light so it didn&#x27;t take more than one or two coats to show up well.</li>
      <li>We don&#x27;t let her put on much, but she is delighted to have the colors.  </li>
      <li>I was very pleased with the product, colors are very vivid and they stay on clump free!</li>
      <li>Easy to remove it</li>
      <li>Rinsed off easily.</li>
      <li>, Teal is very nice, green, look good.  </li>
      <li>You get 6 colors for a cheap price, but they don&#x27;t smell so great, the writing was wearing off already, and the mascara itself wasn&#x27;t enough to enhance your lashes at all.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, cheap material</li>
      <li>but as she moved in the light you come see the color.</li>
      <li>Very worth the price.</li>
      <li>It took over 4 weeks for me to receive them but they were worth it!</li>
      <li>Truly love these make my eyes pretty</li>
      <li>it really makes the color pop for more drama 😉</li>
      <li>The brush style is basic but still good.</li>
      <li>It is very age appropriate for her.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re real, but this is a good mascara as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery will order again</li>
      <li>Was sent quickly.  </li>
      <li>Blue, mmmm perfect color, very blue.  </li>
      <li>Super fun.</li>
      <li>I am red hair and the blues look amazing</li>
      <li>You can smell the toxicity as you apply this mascara, but the color is fun.</li>
      <li>The variety in colors is a lot of fun</li>
      <li>The Teal, Purple, and Blue showed up nicely on my lashes  </li>
      <li>I bought these just too fun up my everyday/date night makeup and these were exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I would highly reccommend these colors for the young lady in your life if your looking for age appropriate makeup.  </li>
      <li>Looks exactly as the picture.</li>
      <li>And shipping was fast !</li>
      <li>Gift for grand daughters, they say they love this so much and use them everyday</li>
      <li>There just bright enough to add a hint of style to your makeup but not so vivid that it sticks out as the main part of your makeup.</li>
      <li>I bought these with my own personal use in mind, but my 13 year old saw them and claimed them as hers.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t really notice the color...</li>
      <li>I really like it</li>
      <li>you can see it if you are very close</li>
      <li>I really cant believe that this product ever received 5 stars.</li>
      <li>good product, only the color is somewhat lighter than expected</li>
      <li>The black one is okay.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t screw caps on tight or you won&#x27;t be able to unscrew</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>The shipping was a tad bit slower than I would have liked (took a week to ship, and a week and a half to receive), but no big deal.</li>
      <li>Most likely won&#x27;t even bother with the other colors.</li>
      <li>She wore purple the other day and it looked so cool when she would move.</li>
      <li>I have purchased other brands of brightly colored mascaras in the past and they did not compare.  </li>
      <li>I tried them both on clean lashes as well as over black like others recommended.</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;ve tried the purple and the teal.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely not an everyday look.</li>
      <li>Green was more of a Teal color, Blue was also.</li>
      <li>Some of the mascaras are not what I expected, but they are fun.</li>
      <li>because there are the purple, the green and the blue that are a bit more noticeable..</li>
      <li>It goes on easier if you first put a black mascara on so that the color stands out a little more.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast but also sent back fast with little effort.</li>
      <li>😒 they are barely noticeable.</li>
      <li>The colors are beautiful,  u won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
      <li>Not only are the colors, cute, but they gave my natural  lashes volume as well, and the colors show up on false lashes too.</li>

    <li> Well I gave 2*, because when I put them on (I&#x27;ve tried all of them) I couldn&#x27;t really notice the color... So I hoped the colors were brighter and more visible..Also the texture is a bit dry.. However, it&#x27;s okay because there are the purple, the green and the blue that are a bit more noticeable..</li>
    <li> good product, only the color is somewhat lighter than expected</li>
    <li> Super fun. The colors are not as bright as I anticipated. I do like them but probably wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
    <li> I love these. The shipping was a tad bit slower than I would have liked (took a week to ship, and a week and a half to receive), but no big deal.

Oh, one more thing, if you get glitter mascara to match each color (purple glitter with this purple mascara) it really makes the color pop for more drama 😉</li>
    <li> Great variety of colors. The only issue I have is the blue is not blue it&#x27;s purple.</li>
    <li> You can smell the toxicity as you apply this mascara, but the color is fun.</li>
    <li> Good colors but you have to put a lot on to actually see it.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with the colors 😒 they are barely noticeable. The black one is okay.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery will order again</li>
    <li> not like any other mascara. more like yucky paint that doesn&#x27;t stay where you put it.</li>
    <li> The variety in colors is a lot of fun and I have not had any issue with the color coming through.  Oh, all the wonderful compliments I have been getting.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used black first then hint of gold with my other makeup lasted all night ! Does not smudge or flake !  I will buy again when needed.  And shipping was fast !</li>
    <li> You get 6 colors for a cheap price, but they don&#x27;t smell so great, the writing was wearing off already, and the mascara itself wasn&#x27;t enough to enhance your lashes at all. You can see the color okay, but you don&#x27;t get any volume or definition using these color mascaras. Sadly, I threw mine away after only a few uses 😞.</li>
    <li> Makes me want to lick my wife&#x27;s eyes</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiful!  I have purchased other brands of brightly colored mascaras in the past and they did not compare.  The Teal, Purple, and Blue showed up nicely on my lashes  My lashes are light so it didn&#x27;t take more than one or two coats to show up well.</li>
    <li> Terrible.  Don&#x27;t purchase</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t  wait to try these. Disappointed. So far I&#x27;ve tried the purple and the teal. Didn&#x27;t  see the colors on my lashes at all. I tried them both on clean lashes as well as over black like others recommended. Same result. Most likely won&#x27;t even bother with the other colors.</li>
    <li> I had to apply this a few times for the color to show but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my granddaughter&#x27;s first little makeup set. We don&#x27;t let her put on much, but she is delighted to have the colors.  We took the two dark colors from her as she isn&#x27;t old enough for that yet.  Nice bonus for her mom.  Great product...really good value.  It isn&#x27;t waterproof or smudgeproof, but good for the price.  Nice sturdy brushes inside.</li>
    <li> Great color, easy to apply. Make my lashes look longer than ever.&lt;br /&gt;Would recomended and buy it again</li>
    <li> Great!! Just what I expected. I&#x27;ve been looking for color mascara after the store discontinued the brand I was getting previously.&lt;br /&gt;Great product. I&#x27;m glad I found these on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great colors, smooth application, gives me a great look that&#x27;s a lot of fun.  Stays on without smear or smudge. The purple is my favorite.</li>
    <li> Very pretty colors,and very happy with the coverage.  I love Benefit&#x27;s They&#x27;re real, but this is a good mascara as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
    <li> This mascara is crap! I hate I ordered it......</li>
    <li> This is an adequate makeup product but not great. I like the teal the best.</li>
    <li> I bought these to try for makeup applications. These are poor quality. The colors are darker than pictured and it ends up on your eyelids. They give no volume or length. Def not professional quality, but you get what you pay for sometimes. I sent mine back and had to pay shipping &#x3D;( So don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> NOT SOMETHING I WOULD BUY AGAIN</li>
    <li> The only reason that I&#x27;m not giving this 5 stars, is that I actually misunderstood about the teal mascara.  I thought I&#x27;d be getting a green one instead of the teal.</li>
    <li> Nice color, I got this mascara because all i want it was the purple, I ended up loving all the color.  Purple you can see it if you are very close, Teal is very nice, green, look good.  Blue, mmmm perfect color, very blue.  The rest I haven&#x27;t try it yet.  Easy to remove it, I didn&#x27;t use any makeup or oil to remove the mascara, only water while I was washing my face.  I really like it</li>
    <li> Some of the mascaras are not what I expected, but they are fun.</li>
    <li> Colors are NICE! However, it doesn&#x27;t do any thickening or lash building, so all you get is a thin sweep of color, you have to put something on the lashes first to get them to build up.  GREAT colors though!</li>
    <li> Almost empty mascara tubes? I really cant believe that this product ever received 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Gift for grand daughters, they say they love this so much and use them everyday</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiful. It goes on easier if you first put a black mascara on so that the color stands out a little more. The mascara itself seems like it will dry out pretty rapidly, and it wears a little gummy on three lashes. It&#x27;s definitely not an everyday look. Rinsed off easily.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, cheap material you have too put so many times for you can see the lines. I have to put a start for it can let me write a review bit it doesn&#x27;t deserve none.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves the different colors.  Was sent quickly.  Looks exactly as the picture.</li>
    <li> Cannot beat the price!</li>
    <li> i love the colors they look great</li>
    <li> I returned them, they were all dry, not one of them left color on my latches!</li>
    <li> Nice colors. Came in less than a week</li>
    <li> Love it...wish product was bolder</li>
    <li> Truly love these make my eyes pretty</li>
    <li> Nice colors, just not any lash building.</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiful,  u won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
    <li> I love these colored mascaras. They are mat mascaras. The brush style is basic but still good. There just bright enough to add a hint of style to your makeup but not so vivid that it sticks out as the main part of your makeup.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the product, colors are very vivid and they stay on clump free! The Teal and purple are my favorite I would highly recommend them. Only problem was the shipping... It took over 4 weeks for me to receive them but they were worth it!</li>
    <li> The green shown in picture is not the same green.  It is very blue, almost a turquoise.  If you are looking for a jewel toned green, this is not it.  Other colors are as pictured.</li>
    <li> Smells very strongly bad odor. Green was more of a Teal color, Blue was also. Shipped fast but also sent back fast with little effort. So, it is what it is when you take a chance. Amazon approval for me is the only way to go.</li>
    <li> I am red hair and the blues look amazing</li>
    <li> My niece wanted purple mascara so my mother in law ordered this set for her. There are some great colors in this set. She wore purple the other day and it looked so cool when she would move. You can&#x27;t tell it is purple all the time but as she moved in the light you come see the color. I don&#x27;t know about the other colors quite yet. I think she only wanted the purple.</li>
    <li> I like the colors and the material !</li>
    <li> I bought these with my own personal use in mind, but my 13 year old saw them and claimed them as hers.  She uses a little bit of white eyelash primer to really make the green, purple, and blue to pop.  Especially for a young girl, it allows her to wear mascara without the dramatic look of black.  It is very age appropriate for her.  She has no issues with it causing irritation and it washes off very easily, without leaving the dreaded raccoon eyes.  I would highly reccommend these colors for the young lady in your life if your looking for age appropriate makeup.  I have to order myself a set :)</li>
    <li> you have to apply multiple coats unless you have lighter eyelashes</li>
    <li> Pleased with this order.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t screw caps on tight or you won&#x27;t be able to unscrew</li>
    <li> Good price. Good product. Very worth the price. Will buy more.</li>
