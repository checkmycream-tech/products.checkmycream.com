      <li>Many lotions either don&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t stay on, smell to strongly, or irritate my skin</li>
      <li>so im sticking with lubriderm fragrance free forever :)</li>
      <li>It is much cheaper than market and good quality.</li>
      <li>Very good, although still a bit sticky, but much better than cetaphil, my GF has extremely dry skin</li>
      <li>Wonderful that it really doesn&#x27;t have a scent - I can&#x27;t stand scented lotions at all and this is exactly what you want when you need a basic, good moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Non sticky, v pleasant to smell and 24hr effective in Midwest dry weather.</li>
      <li>Even the old \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; had a smell, and a pleasant one at that.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve tried all the products that make the promises but Lubriderm still delivers the best moisturizer without the greasy mess and extended time for it to absorb.</li>
      <li>This product is available for $6.29 at Target.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly with no sticky feeling at any time.  </li>
      <li>lotion does contain silicones (dimethicone) and parabens but appears to be free of animal-derived products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Non- greasy and light fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Thus, I was hoping something unscented and also free of dyes would smooth out the skin of my legs and also minimize the amount of irritation</li>
      <li>Nice soft smooth feel love this lotion.great product.</li>
      <li>i have been lubriderm fan for years, it is so good to my skin, I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Good for treating sensitive skin or if you don&#x27;t want to smell too perfumy.</li>
      <li>I save that for special occasions.  </li>
      <li>My favorite is the non-scented because I really don&#x27;t like any scent and don&#x27;t wear perfume.</li>
      <li>This lotion is good all around; used long term</li>
      <li>I bought this because it came in a fairly large package and was fragrance free.</li>
      <li>(For the record, I was looking to moisturize the skin and calm the irritation caused by stretch marks, not get rid of the stretch marks or reduce them-this review is solely based on the moisturizing ability of this lotion.)</li>
      <li>It is not greasy and is absorbed well into the skin.</li>
      <li>They had a good formula with the old stuff--\\&quot;developed by doctors.\\</li>
      <li>/&gt;Granted, because I recently started using this lotion (a month ago or so), I can&#x27;t compare it to the old formula that previous reviewers seem to like better, but I&#x27;m very happy with this formula.  </li>
      <li>Moisturizes without being greasy, soaks right in</li>
      <li>The fact that it&#x27;s fragrance free is vital to me.  </li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>However, if you&#x27;re like me and are experiencing it for the first time, there is a lot to like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Always look for the Fragrance Free in this brand if you have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Always used to be price competitive but now typically much higher than retail.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect consistency-thin enough to easily rub in, but thick enough to stay put-and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel at all.</li>
      <li>i will continue to purchase it as long as the price doesn&#x27;t increase there isn&#x27;t another product that work as good as the lubriderm-tried many others not satisfied.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily, but it has no lasting effect.  </li>
      <li>Smells good and goes on pretty thick.</li>
      <li>it works really well on dry skin, and I love the fact that it has no perfume, as I am allergic to fragrance.</li>
      <li>and you don&#x27;t have to use a whole lot to get the job done.</li>
      <li>Plus, it is reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>Fragrance free lubriderm is the only all over body lotion I use.</li>
      <li>and this really helped her condition</li>
      <li>It really keeps me with keeping my skin refreshed.</li>
      <li>also appreciate that the lotion doesn&#x27;t leave much residue so it doesn&#x27;t leave my keyboard and mouse an oily mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My mom has used Lubriderm my whole life.</li>
      <li>After suffering from dry, scaly hands from the dry air of an office environment, this lotion is providing good relief.</li>
      <li>Change it back to the original.</li>
      <li>I use this cream more than any other.</li>
      <li>we have extremely sensitive skin in this house and lubriderm fragrance free is the only lotion that is affordable and that works on our skin.</li>
      <li>What catapults it into the top for me are several things: it does not have a greasy feel to it; it is not just unscented but actually fragrance</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Free\\&quot;, which is true, but it does have a slight \\&quot;medicinal\\&quot; scent that I don&#x27;t really like.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use products with fragrance in them this lotion makes my skin feel silky and soft when i put it on my feet and heels you can notice the difference.</li>
      <li>It is, of course, the same product I have been using; the convenience of shopping online, and having quick access to the product, makes a big difference for me in saving time and money.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t feel too much after applying it, such as too oily or too sticky.</li>
      <li>I like that it&#x27;s unscented (although I do believe it comes in a scented version) for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>She is seventy this year and always gets comments on how people think she is in her fifties or early sixties.</li>
      <li>This lotion soothes my dry skin and is very gentle.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, it is not too strong and as long as you don&#x27;t use too much lotion</li>
      <li>free meaning no scent whatsoever; it immediately soothes and refreshes dry skin, even excessively dry skin; and it lasts.</li>
      <li>Bath and Body works lotions and creams, and regular old Vaseline.</li>
      <li>And any small nicks or cuts heal quickly and without itching or redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Really like this cream as its not filled with fragrance and doesn&#x27;t irritate my highly sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I use lubriderm frequently to treat my dry skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use it for my tattoos, no added fragrance and no petrolatum.  Smells good and goes on pretty thick.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful moisturizer. It is not greasy and is absorbed well into the skin. I use it every night on my hands, elbows and knees.</li>
    <li> As recommended by my physician, and without the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes without being greasy, soaks right in</li>
    <li> my favorite. Use it every day</li>
    <li> My skin can get dry during the dry season, but also tends to be sensitive to seemingly random ingredients. Even some of the all-natural options leave them red and rashy. This lotion soothes my dry skin and is very gentle. No irritation at all.</li>
    <li> This product is available for $6.29 at Target. Rip off at Amazon..&lt;br /&gt;What is happening with this company? Always used to be price competitive but now typically much higher than retail. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> we have extremely sensitive skin in this house and lubriderm fragrance free is the only lotion that is affordable and that works on our skin.</li>
    <li> Good product great pricing</li>
    <li> Fragrance free lubriderm is the only all over body lotion I use. It doesn&#x27;t have perfumes and isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky.</li>
    <li> After suffering from dry, scaly hands from the dry air of an office environment, this lotion is providing good relief. I did not try other brands, so I cannot give a comparison, but I can attest that my hands are smoother now and don&#x27;t have that \\&quot;dry skin itchy\\&quot; feeling anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate that the lotion doesn&#x27;t leave much residue so it doesn&#x27;t leave my keyboard and mouse an oily mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is the scent. The label states it is \\&quot;Fragrance Free\\&quot;, which is true, but it does have a slight \\&quot;medicinal\\&quot; scent that I don&#x27;t really like. Fortunately, it is not too strong and as long as you don&#x27;t use too much lotion the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
    <li> I use lubriderm frequently to treat my dry skin. This is a good bathroom size.</li>
    <li> Nice soft smooth feel love this lotion.great product.</li>
    <li> Really like this cream as its not filled with fragrance and doesn&#x27;t irritate my highly sensitive skin. I use this cream more than any other. Not to be confused with the &amp;#34;Sensitive Skin&amp;#34; bottle which is harsh and makes skin dry. Don&#x27;t know why but it does. Always look for the Fragrance Free in this brand if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is, in my opinion, the best hand lotion on the market. What catapults it into the top for me are several things: it does not have a greasy feel to it; it is not just unscented but actually fragrance free meaning no scent whatsoever; it immediately soothes and refreshes dry skin, even excessively dry skin; and it lasts. It may not have a fancy name, but it it is the best at what it does. I give this my highest recommendation.</li>
    <li> I am not a longtime Lubriderm lotion user, so I don&#x27;t have experience with the previous version. I bought this because it came in a fairly large package and was fragrance free. I intended to use it after shaving my legs; when I have used fragranced lotions after shaving in the past, I have gotten itchy and any cuts from shaving have been slow to heal. Thus, I was hoping something unscented and also free of dyes would smooth out the skin of my legs and also minimize the amount of irritation I experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am quite happy with the results. My legs are nice and smooth after using this, with no irritation whatsoever. I don&#x27;t feel greasy or oily after applying it. And any small nicks or cuts heal quickly and without itching or redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion does contain silicones (dimethicone) and parabens but appears to be free of animal-derived products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that some users of the previous version of Lubriderm are unhappy with the changes to the product, so please keep in mind that it *has* changed, if you have ordered and used it in years past. However, if you&#x27;re like me and are experiencing it for the first time, there is a lot to like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the ingredients, in case the product listing changes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum), Glycerin, Capric/Caprylic Triglyceride, Cetyl Alcohol, Panthenol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Stearic Acid, Dimethicone, Carbomer, Ceteareth 20, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Citrate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Fragrance, Citric Acid, Ethylparaben</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve tried all the products that make the promises but Lubriderm still delivers the best moisturizer without the greasy mess and extended time for it to absorb. Delivery was prompt.</li>
    <li> I use this on my tattoos on occasion when my skin dries out. Also works wonders on elbows!</li>
    <li> Use this lotion daily, and is, in my opinion, the best.  The fact that it&#x27;s fragrance free is vital to me.  Goes on smoothly with no sticky feeling at any time.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t feel too much after applying it, such as too oily or too sticky. It is very good product for its price.</li>
    <li> It is much cheaper than market and good quality. The volume is big! I think it can be used about half a year to me.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I will buy one more after it runs out.</li>
    <li> I have skin allergies and i HATE the scented stuff.  So this works well without being all oily.  The pump works well too so there&#x27;s really no complaints!  It&#x27;s a lot of lotion in this bottle!</li>
    <li> good quality and pricing</li>
    <li> It really keeps me with keeping my skin refreshed.</li>
    <li> since its ingrendients are safe and fragrance free, it&#x27;s good for both adults and babies. I like it a lot! The price is also very good!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased some Lubriderm, Daily Moisture, \\&quot;fragrance free,\\&quot; to replace my empty bottle. The container said \\&quot;New Look,\\&quot; but it also smelled different--It smelled bad. It STINKS! I compared the ingredients, and sure enough--they changed. Even the old \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; had a smell, and a pleasant one at that. But the new stuff, \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; is not a pleasant smell. They had a good formula with the old stuff--\\&quot;developed by doctors.\\&quot; So why change it? Did the doctors change their minds? Maybe it works just as well, but please, Lubriderm: Change it back to the original.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it.  I am not going to slather expensive, perfumy lotions all over my body every day.  I save that for special occasions.  Lubriderm is what goes on my knees, my legs, my feet, my arms, and everywhere else.  It&#x27;s nonirritating, has no scent (so I can wear perfume that won&#x27;t clash), and it moisturizes all day long.  Even my guy uses it.</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion that works to moisturize my skin. Not greasy feeling at all.  I use in all seasons.</li>
    <li> have used it for years and continue to. It is well priced and keeps hands from getting too dry. Out it on your feet when you go to bed and you will get hooked.</li>
    <li> Solid, as expected lubriderm product. Wonderful that it really doesn&#x27;t have a scent - I can&#x27;t stand scented lotions at all and this is exactly what you want when you need a basic, good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Best fragrance free, hypoallergenic lotion.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but I know people who do, and this lotion works well for them.  It&#x27;s a simple moisturizer, no frills or fancy designs or smells.  I&#x27;m a guy and I don&#x27;t like walking around smelling like either flowers or the usual male musky fragrances.  No smell in this lotion, I like it.</li>
    <li> Very good, although still a bit sticky, but much better than cetaphil, my GF has extremely dry skin and this really helped her condition</li>
    <li> I often shop at amazon.com for products I previously purchased in local stores.  I frequently find prices that, even with shipping, total less than the price I pay in stores.  This is the case with the Lubriderm I purchased from amazon.com.  It is, of course, the same product I have been using; the convenience of shopping online, and having quick access to the product, makes a big difference for me in saving time and money.</li>
    <li> Works great my wife likes no fragrence so that&#x27;s the big plus</li>
    <li> Everything worked out wonderfully and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product, hopefully if I need something in future I will order from them again,&lt;br /&gt;Have a Wonderful and Blessed Day!&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Jeffery D Chapman Sr</li>
    <li> I know I am not supposed to use a lotion that contains alcohol on my face, but this lotion is the only one that gets rid of my winter dryness.</li>
    <li> Non greasy, non smelly...and you don&#x27;t have to use a whole lot to get the job done. Even my lotion-hating hubby can tolerate this stuff.  ;)</li>
    <li> Years ago I visited a dermatologist who gave me a list of body lotions to use for  my dry skin.  At the time I had no idea of what a good lotion was versus one that was mostly made of water. I have used Lubriderm for years based on my dermatologist&#x27;s recommendation and have been the better for it.  This lotion is good all around; used long term it keeps my skin healthy.</li>
    <li> it works really well on dry skin, and I love the fact that it has no perfume, as I am allergic to fragrance. I trust Lubriderm.</li>
    <li> Good for treating sensitive skin or if you don&#x27;t want to smell too perfumy. What else can I say? It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> Non- greasy and light fragrance.  This is a great moisturizer for the whole family.  We go through it like crazy!</li>
    <li> I use this all the time. I have a job where I wash my hands alot. And the climate is at times bad for skin here. Especially in the winter.  This stuff goes on well &amp; isn&#x27;t too greasy. Thumbs up for me!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use products with fragrance in them this lotion makes my skin feel silky and soft when i put it on my feet and heels you can notice the difference.I think it&#x27;s a great buy for the price i will continue to purchase it as long as the price doesn&#x27;t increase there isn&#x27;t another product that work as good as the lubriderm-tried many others not satisfied.</li>
    <li> It is the best moisturizer I hv used ever for non winter days. Non sticky, v pleasant to smell and 24hr effective in Midwest dry weather.</li>
    <li> I was happy to find the unscented Lubriderm.  I use it every day and the product works and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> My mom has used Lubriderm my whole life. She is seventy this year and always gets comments on how people think she is in her fifties or early sixties. That is proof enough to me. I go through about a bottle of this a month. I use it for body lotion and for face lotion in the winter. It&#x27;s not too heavy. My favorite is the non-scented because I really don&#x27;t like any scent and don&#x27;t wear perfume.</li>
    <li> At my job I often find myself walking indoors and out regardless of the weather, and during the cold months my hands get dry and my knuckles cracked.  I was looking for a lotion that didn&#x27;t have an awful smell, and while this stuff DOES have a scent, it&#x27;s not nearly as strong or as frilly as many of those on the market.  It also works well on dry hands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had itchy skin since I was a kid, and have tried what seems like every lotion on the market-name brand, prescription, generic, and some homemade concoctions. I also have dry hands and periodic eczema. I recently revamped my search for a new lotion after trying cocoa butter on my growing pregnant belly and hated the stuff. (For the record, I was looking to moisturize the skin and calm the irritation caused by stretch marks, not get rid of the stretch marks or reduce them-this review is solely based on the moisturizing ability of this lotion.) I tried Vaseline brand lotion, Eucerin, Palmer&#x27;s brand lotion (not just the cocoa butter), Bath and Body works lotions and creams, and regular old Vaseline. Many lotions either don&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t stay on, smell to strongly, or irritate my skin (rash/hives).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, because I recently started using this lotion (a month ago or so), I can&#x27;t compare it to the old formula that previous reviewers seem to like better, but I&#x27;m very happy with this formula.  It&#x27;s the perfect consistency-thin enough to easily rub in, but thick enough to stay put-and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel at all. I like that it&#x27;s unscented (although I do believe it comes in a scented version) for sensitive skin. Plus, it is reasonably priced. I have finally found the perfect lotion for me.</li>
    <li> I expected a richer lotion from Lubriderm.  It goes on easily, but it has no lasting effect.  Overall, it was a disappointment.</li>
    <li> i have been lubriderm fan for years, it is so good to my skin, I have sensitive skin so i cannot use any lotion as i immediately get rash or it kind of burns so im sticking with lubriderm fragrance free forever :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good one.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy some more if I get some discount.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
