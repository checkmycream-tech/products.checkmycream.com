<li> Think this is helping with some of my minor wrinkles.</li>
<li> All other kinds of collagen requires me to take them three times per day, but I know i could forget to do that often.</li>
<li> It is early; I am thin, but I am seeing improvement in my arms and my neck.</li>
<li> I take two of this everyday, with my other collagen.  </li>
<li> So disappointed after reading about this product in a health magazine, going straight to Amazon to order, only to see the ingredient list---------UGH!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> dont waste your money doesnt work</li>
<li> Pills are small and in punch out foil.  </li>

<ol>
    <li> Makes her look beautiful</li>
    <li> too soon to tell how  or if it helps</li>
    <li> I have the habbit of taking collagen. I compared several producers and decided to go with New Nordic collagen. First, it is produced in north Europe and seemed very carefully make. Second, I only need to take it once a day. All other kinds of collagen requires me to take them three times per day, but I know i could forget to do that often. So, I am going with this more effective one!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know result still taking them.</li>
    <li> I have not seen a difference yet.</li>
    <li> Think this is helping with some of my minor wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I take two of this everyday, with my other collagen.  I see a big difference, my skin is firmer and looks to have a more of a glow.  I seen the episode on Dr.Oz and decided to give it a try.  Glad I did.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Pills are small and in punch out foil.  It is early; I am thin, but I am seeing improvement in my arms and my neck.</li>

    <li> Shame on you New Nordic for including TALC in a potentially really great product. Talc is on the list of the TOP 5 dangerous ingredients to stay away from in vitamins/supplements. Talc has basically the same composition as asbestos and I highly doubt you&#x27;d swallow that in pill form! If you care anything about your body, you&#x27;ll take your wrinkles over cancer! So disappointed after reading about this product in a health magazine, going straight to Amazon to order, only to see the ingredient list---------UGH!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://info.achs.edu/blog/5-dangerous-ingredients-in-your-vitamins-and-dietary-supplements</li>
    <li> I have noticed improvement in skin color and lack of breakouts when using this product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin using this product</li>
    <li> Saw a difference in the texture of my skin within days. Love this product...</li>
    <li> I have been taking these for a month know and I already can see a different on my skin</li>
    <li> For me this product works great.  I noticed the difference in about a month&#x27;s time.</li>
    <li> After two months of use, did not see any change - at all.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any effect after taking it for almost a month.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for almost a year.  I saw a difference even before the box was gone. It works, and I didn&#x27;t have to wait a year for resuts.</li>
    <li> Very good product thanks</li>
    <li> Really great product. This company puts our high quality stuff!</li>
