      <li>I loved this product!  </li>
      <li>Good luck to you!</li>
      <li>No way I could have gotten the advertised 2 weeks, but I was still happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Great buy.</li>
      <li>Its fantastic!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thrilled to save 60 bucks a month!  </li>
      <li>Good price and great product.</li>
      <li>I take good care of my nails and have never had this problem before.</li>
      <li>It arrived in a timely manner and in good order.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sticky and does a good job of extending the wear of nail polish if you use it with a good top coat.</li>
      <li>If you put too many coats of nail polish on, it will chip and peel!</li>
      <li>I got five more days out of that manicure!  </li>
      <li>It removes easily, and my nails are in great shape.</li>
      <li>Simply amazing.</li>
      <li>This product is really amazing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had luck painting my own nails, I always make a mess.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Very impressive considering how much my nails bend and flex during a week.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have good luck with keeping polish on or from chipping for more than a day or two.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good, my nails will still chip at the tips, most of the nail polish will still be on.</li>
      <li>I decided to start doing my own nails.</li>
      <li>This is spectacular.</li>
      <li>On the up side the bonder and polish came off VERY easily with polish remover.</li>
      <li>Love it, love it love it!</li>
      <li>I feel that without a top coat it won&#x27;t work unless you are using a 3 in one nail lacquer.</li>
      <li>I wish the salons would use this more too.  </li>
      <li>:)  Make sure to seal with topcoat.</li>
      <li>for now I will continue to use this product until something better comes around.</li>
      <li>Iridescent shades are a bit more stubborn when it comes to longevity.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this product.</li>
      <li>What more can I say?</li>
      <li>I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to keep wearing polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use two coats and be sure to top off the ends.</li>
      <li>thats okay.</li>
      <li>This does work, however this works best if used with a stay put top coat such as revlon color stay.</li>
      <li>Chip Top Coat and the two work fantastic!  </li>
      <li>I would be happy if my nail polish stayed on for 12 hours, much the the 2 weeks claimed on the bottle.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Fabulous!</li>
      <li>Ya just gotta know how to do it :-)</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>being said, the polish it DID work with, that polish lasted 3 days or so before I started seeing wear to the edges (which I felt was pretty good).</li>
      <li>It was so easy to order it from Amazon rather than driving all over to see which beauty supply store is carrying it at the time I need some more.  </li>
      <li>I have noticed that my nail polish chips off more when I use this compared to the cheap NYC brand.</li>
      <li>I had heard good things about this product, but I did not have much luck with this bonder.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years and have never found another that goes on as easily and holds polish without chipping</li>
      <li>Polish applies easily over it</li>
      <li>That does the trick and my manicure lasts easily for a week.  </li>
      <li>It worked fine, but when I removed the polish, all my nails started to peel.  </li>
      <li>It dries quickly too!</li>
      <li>It was very nice not waking up and looking at a nice manicure instead of a chipped mess.</li>
      <li>and I always use cheap nail polish, before getting this product my manicure would chip with in a day,</li>
      <li>I ordered this product with great hopes that it would help my polish last longer.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard great things about Orly Bonder, so when I saw it at my local Sally Beauty I picked up a bottle.</li>
      <li>enjoy</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>Definitely my new favorite!</li>
      <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>With the Orly Bonder, I am able to keep polish on my natural nails for a week or more.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product and have been using it for many years.  </li>
      <li>This stuff really helps when I put polish on top.</li>
      <li>At that point I applied another coat of this, then a coat of color, and a fast drying top coat.</li>
      <li>the next day this does a wonderful job on helping my nail color last longer</li>
      <li>lol I also go over it with top coat a 2nd time like 2/3 days later</li>
      <li>I  highly recommend!!!</li>
      <li>I love being able to do my own nails and have them last so long.  </li>
      <li>I ran out of clear coat and tried this on TOP of my color.</li>
      <li>But for the price, I would say it is worth it.  </li>
      <li>but for what it&#x27;s worth, the stuff is orange, and it made my nails look yellowed and</li>
      <li>and it comes right off.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s chipped right off.</li>
      <li>Great base coat, best I&#x27;ve tried so far!</li>
      <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I give this more than 1 star is because I did like how smooth the application was.</li>
      <li>everyone has different nails that could be affected by your lifestyle of what kind of job you have or sports you participate in or how much your hands are in water or even what you eat.  </li>
      <li>You will notice that it has a funny rubbery feel, you&#x27;ll want to apply your first coat of color immediately.</li>
      <li>apply 1 coat of bonder, two coats of color, then possibly a shatter or glitter layer, and end with a top coat.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Texture and opaque seem to work pretty well.</li>
      <li>This plus the seche vite top coat makes my manicures last</li>
      <li>My nails stay pretty for about 5 days.</li>
      <li>I think it works VERY WELL!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going on three weeks for my first pedicure using it.</li>
      <li>Ugh, I really wanted this bonder to work as advertised!</li>
      <li>Will definitely always use unless I find something even better.</li>
      <li>I was iffy at first about this, but when I actually put it on, I was surprised and really liked the rubbery texture.</li>
      <li>It dries quickly and does not seem to damage my nails or anything, but I am not convinced that it makes a significant difference in lasting time.</li>
      <li>My nails are really healthy; they grow so easily and long I have to cut them short every week.</li>
      <li>First, one of the sites that recommended it was InStyle magazine, and it said something about the pink tone of it giving your nails a healthy glow.</li>
      <li>I use this with Orly Sec N Dry  and have a perfect manicure lasting 5-7  days with no chipping.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read some of the reviews so I thought I would chime in.  I really like this product and have been using it for many years.  I use this as my base coat then two coats of OPI nail polish and then OPI topcoat.  My manicure is solid for 7-10 days.  I have used this same method almost always, but in the very few times I used any other brand then OPI, it chipped or peeled within 48 hours.  One thing to remember....everyone has different nails that could be affected by your lifestyle of what kind of job you have or sports you participate in or how much your hands are in water or even what you eat.  For me, I do a lot of computer work, eat pretty well, drink lots of water, wash some dishes every day, but my hands aren&#x27;t in the water for long periods of time, I don&#x27;t participate in any sports except running and this product works well for me and my lifestyle.  Another thing, you may like a makeup line that you think is just awesome but that same makeup line could break me out in hives.  Just food for thought...what works for one person may not work for another person.  Good luck to you!</li>
    <li> Orly&#x27;s Bonder is a rubberized base coat polish.  It helps to extend my manicure an extra 2-3 days.  I just bought my second bottle of bonder.  I don&#x27;t go through the trouble of painting my nails anymore without this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying one coat of bonder, wait till it is dry to the touch.  You will notice that it has a funny rubbery feel, you&#x27;ll want to apply your first coat of color immediately. Do not wait too long after it dries or it does not work quite as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply 1 coat of bonder, two coats of color, then possibly a shatter or glitter layer, and end with a top coat.&lt;br /&gt;I work in a laundromat and my nails are subjected to horrors on a regular basis.  No product in existence will perform miracles, but this one may help your polish stay put a few days longer.</li>
    <li> this is amazing!!! Ive tried a bunch of different base coats and this is the best one that Ive tried by far! my nail enamel last at least a week! it never used to do that. great product! totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> This product is really amazing. Normally I paint my nails and get 24-48 hours out of them before there is chipping.  So annoying, spending all that time doing them nice and then they are ruined.  With this product my manicure has remained perfect for 120 hours/5 days!! Simply amazing. I am a medical professional so I am not easy on my hands.  I have tried other products out there and this one does the job! I combined this product with Orly Won&#x27;t Chip Top Coat and the two work fantastic!  [[ASIN:B000NCTUOW Orly Won&#x27;t Chip Topcoat-0.6 oz]]</li>
    <li> I read so many glowing reviews before buying this product and was extremely disappointed to find out that it does not perform as claimed. I would be happy if my nail polish stayed on for 12 hours, much the the 2 weeks claimed on the bottle. Between this and the Seche Vite dry fast top coat, I&#x27;m not sure which is the bigger disappointment. Do not waste your considerable amount of money on either.</li>
    <li> I ran out of clear coat and tried this on TOP of my color. WOW surprised me when it kept the polish on MUCH longer than I anticipated. Kinda have to get used to the rubber feeling but Ill take anything to keep the polish on longer. I will surely be coming back for a second bottle give it a shot!</li>
    <li> I believe from the description this is the same product previously offered by Lori Greiner by Orly called Manicure Keeper.  If so, it is absolutely the best base coat I have ever tried.  The tip is to apply your nail polish before the rubberized base coat dries.  I use Seche Vite top coat and apply that as well while the nail polish is still somewhat wet.  That does the trick and my manicure lasts easily for a week.  I generally like to change out my nail polish after several days so I don&#x27;t mind re-doing my manicure once a week or so.  QVC stopped offering this product and I could not find it anywhere until now on Amazon.  It is a definite keeper in my arsenal of nail products.  :)</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and have never found another that goes on as easily and holds polish without chipping</li>
    <li> I was iffy at first about this, but when I actually put it on, I was surprised and really liked the rubbery texture. It dries quickly too! This stuff really helps when I put polish on top. Of course, some nail polishes still need at least 2 coats (depending on the brand and color) but either way, I love this.</li>
    <li> This keeps your polish on forever!  I&#x27;m going on three weeks for my first pedicure using it. Great product. Will reorder.</li>
    <li> I think it works VERY WELL!  What I typically do is apply the bonder and let it sit for about 2 minutes then I apply the color.  I have found that if you use two thin coats that is better...don&#x27;t apply thick coats!  I also paint a thin coat of color after about 2 or 3 days on top and then my manicure will last about 10 days.  When I apply the coat after 2 or 3 days it is usually a little chip (barely noticeable on 1 of the nails).  So for some reason it seals it.  I think it is much easier than removing the polish and re-doing it.  The polish I have on right now has lasted so far for 6 days and it only cost me $.69 cents...and I have no chips!  Polish usually only lasts me a day or two without chipping.</li>
    <li> Anyone who wrote bad reviews obviously doesn&#x27;t know how to properly paint their nails. Ive been using the Orly bonder for 5 years now. Its fantastic!!! I take a file to my nails and lightly rough them up. apply one coat of the bonder. then one coat of O.P.I nail color.I am an aircraft mechanic, and it STILL holds!!! Wonderful results. If you put too many coats of nail polish on, it will chip and peel! Ya just gotta know how to do it :-) enjoy</li>
    <li> I had really high hopes for this product due to reading all the good reviews, but in the end it did more bad then good. My nails are really healthy; they grow so easily and long I have to cut them short every week. Orly Bonder Base Coat actually caused my nails to peel and flake at the tips. I noticed the flaking when the bonder was still on, I couldn&#x27;t help thinking it was really weird because my nails never flake or peel. Once the polish and bonder came off EVERY ONE OF MY NAILS STARTED TO PEEL! I know it has to be ond the bonder because I&#x27;m using the same polish remover and OPI polish I always do. I will never use this product again. Ugh, I really wanted this bonder to work as advertised! On the up side the bonder and polish came off VERY easily with polish remover.</li>
    <li> I am very harsh with my nails and I always use cheap nail polish, before getting this product my manicure would chip with in a day, but now it is lasting me 4-5 days which is fine with me. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try it with more expensive nail polish, the result might be different. after all I think this is a good base coat.</li>
    <li> I tried orly bonder for about a month, but had to stop because it made my nails split.  It has taken me about 10 weeks now after having to repeatedly cut my nails to the quick and they&#x27;re now finally growing without splitting/flaking.  It was great at first, but terrible once the splitting started.  This product just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I tossed out all my Orly polish - bonder, polish and topcoat.</li>
    <li> I have a really hard time keeping polish on my nails usually.  I have rather oily nail beds, and without this bonder the polish just sheets off within a couple days.  With the Orly Bonder, I am able to keep polish on my natural nails for a week or more.  Very impressive considering how much my nails bend and flex during a week.  Also, the one bottle I&#x27;ve owned so far, has lasted me well over a year and I do my nails generally weekly.  I&#x27;m impressed with it.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking to make polish last longer.</li>
    <li> I tried another pre-coat and I got chips the next day.  This bonder helps your nail color stay on longer,</li>
    <li> I just switched from acrylics back to my natural nails so my manicurist (who is awesome so it wasnt lack of skills) used the Orly bonder. Polish started chipping the next day and then peeling in chunks the following day.  Trying the gel manicure next</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd bottle of Orly Bonder and I will never be without it.  Nail polish &amp;#34;binds&amp;#34; with this base coat and my manicure lasts for days.  I have my hands in water a lot during the days, and this bonder is the only one I have ever used that actually works!</li>
    <li> Love it, love it love it! What more can I say? Only that I&#x27;m wishing Orly would develop a top coat that works as well equally...</li>
    <li> The product allows my nail polish to stay on longer than usual and I would really recommend this product to several others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had luck painting my own nails, I always make a mess.&lt;br /&gt;This bonding base coat creates a rubbery-sticky surface and makes painting easier on the nail. Add in that it helps keep your nails from staining, terrific!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this product, it was recommended by several people, but if you look at the picture I uploaded (teal nails) you will see that my manicure lasted a day. I never washed a dish, just worked in an office and it&#x27;s chipped right off. Orly nail polish too.  So this is no better than any other base coat.  It CERTAINLY won&#x27;t make your manicure last two weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Orly Bonder Base Coat for over 10 years and I love it.  It makes my polish (natural nails) last almost 2 full weeks.  My friends are always amazed and I tell them it&#x27;s the bonder/base coat that makes the difference.  I love being able to do my own nails and have them last so long.  I wish the salons would use this more too.  It was so easy to order it from Amazon rather than driving all over to see which beauty supply store is carrying it at the time I need some more.  I will continue to use this as my base coat and to recommend Orly BONDER Base Coat to anyone and everyone who asks!!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best base coat I have ever used. My nail polish lasts much longer and when I&#x27;m ready to remove the polish there is no stains left behind from the polish and it comes right off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and it has prolonged the life of a few of my home manicures. It really depends on the brand and the polish finish. Texture and opaque seem to work pretty well. Iridescent shades are a bit more stubborn when it comes to longevity. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t rave enough about Orly Bonder - it has a rubbery texture, which seems to grab polish so it adheres to the nail SO so much better than any other base coat I&#x27;ve tried (including CND Stickey). Additionally, like any good base coat should, it prevents staining even with the worst culprits. Polish applies easily over it (this is my complaint with CND Stickey - you have to give it some time to dry before applying anything over it, otherwise it will end up looking chunky and messy and you&#x27;ll have to start all over again) and it dries quickly.</li>
    <li> I love this base coat, it has a silicone binder in it that makes any nail polish (even cheapy stuff) last for just a touch longer.</li>
    <li> She loves it! And it actually works. She painted her nails and then washed the dishes and the polish didn&#x27;t chip</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a proper salon quality base coat forever!  This one is awesome and keeps my nails from snapping.</li>
    <li> Works about as good as my regular OPI natural nail base coat.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it thinking your nail polish will last, it won&#x27;t. It is just a lie, believe me, several trials, in all I got the same results, doesn&#x27;t interfere in the normal lasting of the nail polish.</li>
    <li> I had heard good things about this product, but I did not have much luck with this bonder. I used it twice, and my polish chipped in less than a day and it made my nails peel. I&#x27;ve been forced to cut my nails super short for the last couple weeks after using it because of the peeling issue. It&#x27;s so terrible that I didn&#x27;t even give it away to a friend; I chucked it straight into the bin. Don&#x27;t waste your money on it!</li>
    <li> great base, item as described</li>
    <li> I stopped getting acrylic nails and nail gel last year after it took 4 months to grow my nails back healthy. I decided to start doing my own nails. the problem was my nail polish would only last a couple of days.  I purchased this and now my nail polsh lasts for about 5 days without chipping. I wish I could make the polish last for 10 days, but I have not found a product to do that yet. for now I will continue to use this product until something better comes around.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t wear nail polish without my Orly Bonder. It definitely helps your nail polish last a lot longer than usual and also helps decrease stains on your nails from your color. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> i bought this stuff ages ago and try it again every once in a while just in case...or something. idk. all this stuff does is make my polish chip off in one big piece rather than in little flakes. it does absolutely nothing to bond the polish to my nail. my nail polish actually lasts longer when i dont use this stuff. i hate it!</li>
    <li> Great base coat, best I&#x27;ve tried so far! Definitely recommend buying it. Good price and great product. Try it out.</li>
    <li> Great base coat.  It really does get me a few more days out of my manicure. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Was super excited to try this only to be disappointed. My nail polish always peels off within hours of doing a mani.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times since getting it, so I can&#x27;t speak to longevity of a manicure. But it does diminsh the amount of polish I need to use. Two coats is always enough even for very dark or thin polish. I like it so far.</li>
    <li> I like this product but do not love it. I think that is does help to make your nail polish last but it is certainly no miracle product. It dries quickly and does not seem to damage my nails or anything, but I am not convinced that it makes a significant difference in lasting time. I will continue to use it but will probably try a different brand next time.</li>
    <li> I just do not like it.</li>
    <li> This bonder was talked up like crazy by multiple people I speak with.  I was actually surprised at the fact that it started chipping after a few days.  It&#x27;s not nearly as bad as other base coats, but didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations overall.  But for the price, I would say it is worth it.  :)  Make sure to seal with topcoat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard great things about Orly Bonder, so when I saw it at my local Sally Beauty I picked up a bottle. It&#x27;s true that Bonder makes your manicure last longer - I have a very hands on job and my polish usually starts showing wear within 24 hours, but with Bonder it took 4-5 days to show wear at the tips. No way I could have gotten the advertised 2 weeks, but I was still happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after about a week, my nails started to flake and peel. Flaky nails have never been a problem for me; I&#x27;ve used all sorts of nail polish, base coats, top coats, and even left my nails naked, and they haven&#x27;t flaked. Now, however... I just took off my Bonder-based manicure and four of my nails are flaking and others look brittle, like they&#x27;re going to flake at any moment. I&#x27;m so disappointed. I take good care of my nails and have never had this problem before. Now they&#x27;re damaged. I&#x27;m going to give Bonder another try in a few weeks to see if it happens again, but for now I&#x27;ll stick to my old faithful Sally Hansen Insta-Grip (which has NEVER damaged my nails.)</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about buying this. I use two coats and be sure to top off the ends. Fabulous! My nail polish lasted almost a week! I live on a farm with about 500 chickens and 100 goats. I can tell you my hands go thru it. I even planted some stuff in the garden and there was some minimal chipping. I usually have to touch up every morning. It was very nice not waking up and looking at a nice manicure instead of a chipped mess. I  highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> So i wanted to try this because I have had no luck with nail polish staying put. This does work, however this works best if used with a stay put top coat such as revlon color stay. I feel that without a top coat it won&#x27;t work unless you are using a 3 in one nail lacquer.</li>
    <li> This is spectacular. A  wonderful base coat.  A rubbery  seal that adheres to your nails and keeps your polish from chipping.  I use this with Orly Sec N Dry  and have a perfect manicure lasting 5-7  days with no chipping.</li>
    <li> Best base coat for nails ever! Normally doing more than 1 coat of nail polish takes for ever to dry and chips the next day this does a wonderful job on helping my nail color last longer</li>
    <li> This is the best base coat I&#x27;ve used. I don&#x27;t have good luck with keeping polish on or from chipping for more than a day or two. This keeps it on a lot longer!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product with great hopes that it would help my polish last longer.  I was not disappointed. Helps stay longer and fills in all of my ridges</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dentist, so my hands are always in water being washed and generally take a beating. The product claims to help polish stay for up to two weeks. I usually make it right under a week, but I&#x27;m really rough on my hands. The product takes a while to dry.</li>
    <li> Not durable - and I wear gloves while washing my dishes.</li>
    <li> I have not have any really bad experiences with this base coat, but I am not convinced that is makes my manicures last any longer than when I use OPI Nail Envy, which is the base coat I was using before. I think it helps to buff the nails a bit before applying to really get it to stick.</li>
    <li> This plus the seche vite top coat makes my manicures last AT LEAST a week. I usually do my nails once a week so I get to decide when to do them because they never chip anymore. Sometimes I get sick of my nails and have to wash the polish off before they start to chip lol I also go over it with top coat a 2nd time like 2/3 days later and it lasts 7-10 days. I type all day for work so I use to get tip chipping. Not anymore!</li>
    <li> I have not been able to wear nail polish for the past week as my nails have peeled very badly after using this for the 1st time. Maybe it&#x27;s just me as ai have read rave reviews about this bonder. I feel wary to try it again.</li>
    <li> This is a hidden gem. Anyone who paints her nails should have this. One quick coat of this makes all the other work and waiting worth it! My nails stay pretty for about 5 days.</li>
    <li> Adoro o produto e tudo foi entregue com rapidez, considerando que estou no Brasil. Com certeza voltarei a comprar nesta loja.</li>
    <li> It worked fine, but when I removed the polish, all my nails started to peel.  They had never been like this before.  I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to keep wearing polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the other reviews, I see that this product might have caused the problem.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was recommended on a number of blogs. So far so good. I really like this base and I have found that my nail polish doesn&#x27;t chip as much in the same ways as it used to. This is a good, fast drying base, which is very important. I wouldn&#x27;t wear this as itself as I would with some other bases, but in terms of how it looks under nail polish ( i use OPI) this is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have only used this 4-5 times but every time my nail polish stays on without any chips for over a week! The only reason I take it off is because I get tired of my nail polish, but never any chips! I have always had the problem of my nail polish chipping in the shower and with this on it doesn&#x27;t!! Will definitely always use unless I find something even better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still on my search for a good base coat, and this IS NOT it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails chipped within a day.  I&#x27;ve used it multiple times and every single time, my nails chipped very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I give this more than 1 star is because I did like how smooth the application was.</li>
    <li> Best base coat - Using this and Poshe top coat, I can make a mani last up to a week without chipping - and I am hard on my hands.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical how this thing works, now I&#x27;m totally hooked. I first noticed I can paint my nails better after using this base coat; polish brush glides very well and so paint goes on evenly. I&#x27;m hoping this item will also protect my nails from yellowing. I got three different base coat to see which one helps prevent my nails from discoloration, it is still to soon to tell, but I will come back and update my review.</li>
    <li> After a couple days the Orly Bonder peels off along with the nail polish, in one whole piece, like rubbed.</li>
    <li> This base coat is so great. It goes on smoothly and dries quickly, it has saved my manicure to last even longer than any other base coat I&#x27;ve ever used. Definitely my new favorite!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, my nails will still chip at the tips, most of the nail polish will still be on. I may or may not buy it again, I&#x27;m still searching.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product. It arrived in a timely manner and in good order. When its dry it remains tacky so when you put your color on it holds onto it and your nail color lasts a lot longer. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have noticed that my nail polish chips off more when I use this compared to the cheap NYC brand.</li>
    <li> Best basecoat I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s sticky and does a good job of extending the wear of nail polish if you use it with a good top coat. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I loved this product!  It provided a great base for my polish as week as a flexible top coat.  Resisted chipping or peeling for up to two weeks.</li>
    <li> It works better than any other base coats that I have tried. The rubberized texture really helps keep your color on for longer than normal.</li>
    <li> Works very well,  but it takes longer to dry than my other bonders, but thats okay. All I care about is that it works. Orly is a quality brand.</li>
    <li> I was trying to find a great base coat, and after some googling, I had high hopes for this one. First, one of the sites that recommended it was InStyle magazine, and it said something about the pink tone of it giving your nails a healthy glow. I have no idea if ORLY claims this, or just the magazine. Also, I don&#x27;t much care about the tint of it, since it&#x27;s going under my polish... but for what it&#x27;s worth, the stuff is orange, and it made my nails look yellowed and ick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part, though, is how polish goes on over this stuff. I&#x27;ve tried it with four polishes so far, two types of Sally, Essie, and Revlon. It only worked with one of them (the Sally manicure line). The rest of the polishes went on horrible - streaky and lumpy. Same polishes work fine without the ORLY Bonder, so... I&#x27;m left to conclude that is the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had it only happened with the cheaper Sally or Revlon, I may have contributed it to the polish, but after it happened a third time with a brand new bottle of Essie, I&#x27;m writing this one off and looking for a new base coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the polish it DID work with, that polish lasted 3 days or so before I started seeing wear to the edges (which I felt was pretty good). There never was any chipping on the rest of the nail surface, but I took the polish off after about 4 days anyway. I also had Setche Vite top coat on, so I&#x27;m not sure if the lack of chipping can be attributed to the ORLY, the polish, or the Setche Vite, but there it is, for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so great!  I&#x27;ve been paying thirty bucks for shellac manicures because my DYI manicures chipped and peeled after only a few days. I bought this on impulse because it said &amp;#34;rubberized&amp;#34; and it is awesome!  My first mani lasted 7 whole days before I had just slight wear on the tips. At that point I applied another coat of this, then a coat of color, and a fast drying top coat. I got five more days out of that manicure!  It removes easily, and my nails are in great shape. Normally they peel. They are very thin, and usually break before I can get any length. I&#x27;m thrilled to save 60 bucks a month!  Reccomend highly!</li>
