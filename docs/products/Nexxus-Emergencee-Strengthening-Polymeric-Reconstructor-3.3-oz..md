### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>great volume.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nexxus Emergencee is one of the many awesome conditioners that Nexxus has to offer...</li>
      <li>This works great to soften it and leaves it feeling amazing.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied.</li>
      <li>It has strengthened my relaxed hair, and I was thrilled to see that it could be purchased via Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>I first heard about it on one an episode of Oprah&#x27;s when her hair stylists came out and listed the products they used to keep Oprah&#x27;s hair looking so beautiful.  </li>
      <li>Even seems to help my conditioner penetrate the hair shaft better.  </li>
      <li>and I Fell in love w it.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>Do NOT use this more than it recommends regardless of the desire to repair your hair.</li>
      <li>It sealed my hair and worked like magic.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product…</li>
      <li>Glad I was able to find it.</li>
      <li>I used this for the first time today on my relatively fine, fairly damaged hair--over processed with coloring products.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my hair incredibly soft, smooths my split ends perfectly, and diminishes frizz almost completely.</li>
      <li>This treatment is fabulous for restructuring damaged hair.  </li>
      <li>This is a fantastic product that I have used for 25 years.</li>
      <li>This product is great to help strengthen and repair dry, damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;After using this product just once my hair is softer, fuller, and shinier.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to others</li>
      <li>It seems to be similar to those keratin treatments that are popular now.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t undo all the damage but Emergencee is one of the best products out there that you can find to at least minimize how much hair you may lose.</li>
      <li>Even if the bottle had had only one application, it would have been worth the price--my hair is restored!!!</li>
      <li>I had hair extensions and that was how I first came across this product and have sworn by it since.</li>
      <li>As suggested by the reviewer, I first shampooed with a clarifying shampoo before applying this product.</li>
      <li>I personally have better results with the pre-commercial version.</li>
      <li>It really does what it claims!</li>
      <li>I have used Aphogee for many years, and had recently began using it for my breakage problem; however, it was no longer working for me…</li>
      <li>It has been 8 hours since I used the product and my hair is still bouncy, soft, and full and I didn&#x27;t use any styling products.  </li>
      <li>(I am thinking of recommending this product to my sister, who has healthy but very thin, fine hair, it might help to give her hair more body.)</li>
      <li>It feels like glue to me and at first I was surprised by the thick texture of the product, but I went on to use it and found a great improvement in the texture of my frizzy area after rinsing it off.</li>
      <li>So Thanks Amazon for making this product available…</li>
      <li>It was packaged very well.  </li>
      <li>I really see a difference after a couple weeks of use.</li>
      <li>Worked very well for me.</li>
      <li>But, as my hair air-dried something happened that has been missing from my hair since the hair coloring disaster (for more details about this you can see my review of Go Blonder, which didn&#x27;t cause the disaster but has been a valuable part of my hair-swat team).  </li>
      <li>Upon rinsing the deep conditioner, I did shampoo (lightly) and applied a regular conditioner for about 30 seconds.  </li>
      <li>I was very surprised.</li>
      <li>At first as I combed through my clean wet hair, I was thinking \\&quot;well this seems pretty much like what a deep conditioner usually does.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Makes hair feel soft and shiny, with</li>
      <li>I have started using it, but it is too early to evaluate the product itself.</li>
      <li>WOW</li>
      <li>The bottle appears to have about 4 applications for my just below the shoulder, fine but thick, hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It really does what it claims! It sealed my hair and worked like magic. Used it once only and saw the difference already</li>
    <li> Thank you! Great product.  A friend of my recommended this product to me.  Glad I was able to find it.</li>
    <li> It did what they claimed it does.</li>
    <li> I received my product in a timely manner. It was packaged very well.  I have started using it, but it is too early to evaluate the product itself.</li>
    <li> This treatment is fabulous for restructuring damaged hair.  I have multiple hair types from 3B, 3C &amp; 4A texlax strands and this instantly helps strengthen my hair.  Even seems to help my conditioner penetrate the hair shaft better.  However, there are three versions of this.  The formula before Nexxus went commercial to places like Walmart, etc: Polyacrylamidomethylpropane Sulfonic Acid , Water (Aqua) , Collagen Amino Acids , Hydrolyzed Elastin , Propylene Glycol , Hydrolyzed Collagen , Methylchloroisothiazolinone , Methylisothiazolinone , DMDM Hydantoin , Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate , Methylparaben    The newer formulas, seem to have less of ingredients then the older formula: Water (Aqua, Eau), Collagen Amino Acids, Polyacrylamidomethylpropane Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Elastin, Gelatin, Methylparaben, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone    Nexxus also has their Aloxxi line Emergency: : AQUA, POLYACRYLAMIDOMETHYLPROPANE SULFONIC ACID, GOLLAGEN AMINO ACIDS, HYDROLYZED ELASTIN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, METHYLPARABEN, METHYLCHLOROISOTHIAZOLINONE, METHYLISOTHIAZOLINONE, IODOPROPYNYL BUTYLARBAMATE, DMDM HYDANTOIN. SIZE : 500 ml    So be careful which version you happen to pick up.  I personally have better results with the pre-commercial version.</li>
    <li> 2nd purchase of this product.  Makes hair feel soft and shiny, with great volume.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way...Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product that I have used for 25 years. It&#x27;s not easy to find and I&#x27;ve kept it hoarded. Here is a word of caution. You can over treat your hair with Keratin. I had a Salon do 3 treatments in one night and my hair broke because it WILL make your hair brittle. Do NOT use this more than it recommends regardless of the desire to repair your hair. Use coconut oil in between. I had hair extensions and that was how I first came across this product and have sworn by it since. But there is/was a reason it was a licensed  product. Follow the directions and don&#x27;t over use and be patient. You can&#x27;t undo all the damage but Emergencee is one of the best products out there that you can find to at least minimize how much hair you may lose.</li>
    <li> I TRIED THIS PRODUCT, AND I AM NOT INPRESSED, I WOULD NOT TRY IT AGAIN NOR WILL I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S TOO EXPENSIVE NOT TO WORK.  IT SUPPOSE TO STOP YOUR HAIR FROM SHEDDING, AND MY HAIR IS STILL SHEDDING, I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR ABOUT 2-MONTHS..NOT WORKING.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product… After googling a remedy for severe breakage, this product along with Aphogee Protein Treatment were recommended. I have used Aphogee for many years, and had recently began using it for my breakage problem; however, it was no longer working for me… After three consecutive weeks of using Emergencee, my breakage has STOPPED! WOW… The only down fall is that you can not go inside of your local drug store, beauty supply store or salon to purchase it. Amazon was my only option… I even contacted the company and couldn&#x27;t get it from them… So Thanks Amazon for making this product available…</li>
    <li> My friend sent me a sample and I Fell in love w it.  Living in FL, the sun dries my hair. This works great to soften it and leaves it feeling amazing.</li>
    <li> Worked very well for me.</li>
    <li> I really see a difference after a couple weeks of use. My ends are softer and I have less breakage.</li>
    <li> This product is great to help strengthen and repair dry, damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;After using this product just once my hair is softer, fuller, and shinier.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to others</li>
    <li> Nexxus Emergencee is one of the many awesome conditioners that Nexxus has to offer...I have been using this for years.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair with a frizzy spot in the middle that drives me crazy!  I have used Nexxus Emergencee to treat this dry area that tends to break off. It is like a protein treatment. It feels like glue to me and at first I was surprised by the thick texture of the product, but I went on to use it and found a great improvement in the texture of my frizzy area after rinsing it off. I was very surprised. It seems to be similar to those keratin treatments that are popular now. I just use it on that problem area.</li>
    <li> When your hair needs extra care this is the product to get add a plastic cap and sit under the dryer for 15 minutes you have created a Miracle</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It leaves my hair incredibly soft, smooths my split ends perfectly, and diminishes frizz almost completely.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time today on my relatively fine, fairly damaged hair--over processed with coloring products.  I did not follow the directions on the bottle, but rather used some suggestions provided in a review, here on the Amazon site, for a similar Nexxus reconstructor. (see the Emergencee product that has 87 reviews and read the very long one containing step by step procedures.) As suggested by the reviewer, I first shampooed with a clarifying shampoo before applying this product. After combing it in, I wrapped my hair in a plastic bag and then covered this with a towel twisted into a turban. I then conducted some pretty serious household cleaning, but did not sit under a dryer as did the reviewer, and didn&#x27;t remove the product for 45 minutes.  Immediately upon thoroughly rinsing the product out, I applied deep conditioner (I didn&#x27;t shampoo.) The plastic bag and towel were placed back on my head and I continued with the housework, hoping that none of my neighbors would pop in.  Upon rinsing the deep conditioner, I did shampoo (lightly) and applied a regular conditioner for about 30 seconds.  At first as I combed through my clean wet hair, I was thinking \\&quot;well this seems pretty much like what a deep conditioner usually does.\\&quot; But, as my hair air-dried something happened that has been missing from my hair since the hair coloring disaster (for more details about this you can see my review of Go Blonder, which didn&#x27;t cause the disaster but has been a valuable part of my hair-swat team).  The body and fullness is BACK in my hair. It actually seems even fuller than before the disaster.  Deep conditioning alone had softened and smoothed my hair and given it shine, but my hair was limp and felt thinner. I was starting to think that my hair was perhaps falling out due to all the trauma. It has been 8 hours since I used the product and my hair is still bouncy, soft, and full and I didn&#x27;t use any styling products.  (I am thinking of recommending this product to my sister, who has healthy but very thin, fine hair, it might help to give her hair more body.) I plan to use this product again, soon.  The bottle appears to have about 4 applications for my just below the shoulder, fine but thick, hair.  Even if the bottle had had only one application, it would have been worth the price--my hair is restored!!!</li>
    <li> Nexxus Enmergfencee Strengthening Polymeric Reconstructor is a product I have used before.  I first heard about it on one an episode of Oprah&#x27;s when her hair stylists came out and listed the products they used to keep Oprah&#x27;s hair looking so beautiful.  It has strengthened my relaxed hair, and I was thrilled to see that it could be purchased via Amazon.com.</li>
