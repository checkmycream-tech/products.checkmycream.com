<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works really fast and great on my short hair</li>
    <li> Works great for my fine, short hair. The curls last,. Heats up very quickly and cools down really fast. Start on a setting of 3-4 and then increase heat setting slowly.</li>
    <li> This is a great curling iron, and I never burn my fingers on it (like I do the rest of my irons).  It heats fast and has a nice, tight spring.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair.  Because of this, I need a small rod curling iron and 1/2 inch is perfect for me.  I like the Hype Hair iron because it has many settings.  I would recommend this to anyone who needs a smaller rod.</li>
    <li> It was supposed to set the curls and that it does.  I won&#x27;t be using it near my neckline any more though.  It gets VERY hot and I got a nasty burn.</li>
    <li> It gets very hot &amp; gives great curls.  I bought bought this 1/2 inch barrel, as well as a 3/4 inch.  A week or so ago, I was using this to curl my hair &amp; the little black tip (that you hold to avoid being burnt) fell off.  This is the reason for the missing star.  I tried to put it back on, but it won&#x27;t stay on.  Therefore, I really can&#x27;t use it safely.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find a half inch curling iron in town, so was glad to find it at Amazon.com -- it works great, heats fast.  I avoid the higher settings after reading about some folks burned their hair, but recommend it on the low and medium settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly a year.  It&#x27;s still awesome!</li>
    <li> After a few weeks use the barrel separates slightly from the clip making it impossible to secure the hair.  This happened to my old one but I had used it for a couple of years.  Now I must tighten the screws every few days to make it work.  It&#x27;s not easy to find a 1/2 in barrel.</li>
    <li> i choose this rating because I really like the product; the different heat settings and the turbo setting it has.</li>
    <li> I thought this would work ok with my shoulder length hair, but, it burned it and it&#x27;s not smooth so the hair gets tangled on the curling wand, would be better if ceramic I&#x27;m sure.  Be careful.</li>
    <li> Lady told me about this curling iron. When we got it it said used for most people with ethnic hair. We still tried it and it heats up very quickly and gets very hot so be careful with it but it makes the absolute best curls. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I love it! It heats up fast and quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this a 5 star because, usually when I want to curl my hair, it will not last the entire day. I&#x27;ve tried using other hair curl but usually it will last one hour and it will start drooping down. Being able to use this hair curler, it was able to make my hair curl all day til the next day (if I don&#x27;t wash my hair that night) without even using hair spray. I definitely would buy this product again if mine ever goes out.</li>
    <li> Great curling iron. Gets hot fast. Easy to handle. The turbo feature is too hot for my hair so&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it. Love it</li>
    <li> Fell apart after a fem months</li>
    <li> Could not find in stores, but love it for my curly hair</li>
    <li> Best curling iron ever.  The half-inch barrel is almost impossible to find.  There is an  excellent grip, with various heat controls.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> My short hair is hard to curl and style.  I have gone from a curling iron with a 1.5 inch barrel down to a 3/4 inch barrel.  Now I have this 1/2-inch Conair curling iron.  I really love it.  My hair has some bounce to it and the style lasts for longer than an hour.  I have extremely thin hair, but this is very good in covering up any &amp;#34;bald&amp;#34; spots.  With so many different heating choices, 1-30, it&#x27;s easy to find how hot you want the curling iron to be for best results.  It also has a special button that gives an extra bit of heat suddenly.  I tried that, and it burned my hair.  However, my hair is very fine, so it might work better with someone who has thicker hair. It also takes longer to curl, because it is smaller.  But my hair looks so much better, I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> Purchased this curling iron for my very short, graying hair.  It gives great curl and body and makes my hair much more manageable.  It heats very quickly and has a wide range of temperatures.</li>
    <li> The perfect size for giving some depth to short haircuts. I love being able to &amp;#34;dress up&amp;#34; a short cut when I want to.</li>
    <li> The cord doesn&#x27;t swivel as freely as it should and the cord tangles as you turn the iron to wrap your hair.</li>
    <li> This curling iron curls great!! It&#x27;s very small ,so it&#x27;s great for short hair. It&#x27;s also great for spiral curls... Straw curl look. It&#x27;s a great curling Iron. Would buy one a little bigger.</li>
    <li> I like how fast this heats up and it is just the perfect size for doing my hair.  I use it on a low heat setting and have always had great results</li>
    <li> This is the best curling iron that a straight hair person can use.  Just have to really read the instructions about what temp to put it on for the thickness of a person hair.  I would definitely order it again, if this ever quits working.</li>
    <li> Had been unable to find this item at a reasonable price in any of the local retail stores.  The size, function, and price were exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> The clamp on this iron didn&#x27;t even close all the way so there was no way to be able to actually curl you hair with this item. Very dissatisfied, so I returned it.</li>
    <li> This curling iron produces amazing curls! After months of use the on/ off button has became harder to press but other than that I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have spent a lot of money through the years for curling irons but this one is by far the best of all of them and the least expensive too. You cannot go wrong with this purchase.  I was a little skeptical buying a brand I had never heard of but it tops the others by far. You will be pleasantly surprised at the quality and price.</li>
    <li> I have had several curling irons by Conair but, this one is a little different.  While recently using this curling iron a screw came loose and fell onto my shoulder.  The screw was extremely hot and when I flicked it off my shoulder it fell under my shirt.  I danced around to get it off of my as it was burning everywhere it touched.  4 days later I have a burn mark on my stomach.  I tried to put the screw back on the iron but it will not tighten down so I know it&#x27;s going to fall out again.</li>
    <li> Works perfecty.  Good price.</li>
    <li> No complaints- works well for small curls and bangs on very short hair.</li>
    <li> When her other curling iron died, she was in a panic. I checked local stores including Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply. This was the best value for the money. It took her a bit of getting used to because of the different temperature settings, but once she figured it out she was pleased.</li>
    <li> Heats quickly, easy to use, great results!!!!</li>
    <li> ok so the reason i am giving it two starts yes it works but the is that i was doing my hair and i was noticing every 5 min i would have to turn it back on and i asked my friend who does hair for a living are hair curlers suppost to turn off on their own after a sertain amount of time and she said NO . so than i knew it was defaulty , worst one of all time . look for a better one better price my theroy is if you can spend a little more than what you actually paid for than go for it buy a little more exspensive to get a better deal and luck thanks .</li>
    <li> Although my hair is not as thick as it used to be I thought I co get some good spiral curls. My hair is shoulder length. I believe this iron is just too small to accomplish what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find this size iron, or I would be looking for another one just because it feels SO cheap. However it actually does a good job, and the curls hold. It does not catch my hair. I just hate the way it feels (hollow and cheap). It is actually a little bit smaller than my hot tools the same size, which I like. I bought this for it&#x27;s shut off feature that my hot tools lacks.</li>
    <li> The heat it produces is too much for the metal it is made of. The barrel actually bent and warped the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> Nice little curling iron for the money. It will give you those tight curls you want, but I decided I like the larger size for my hair, but this one is a good one.</li>
    <li> I love the curling iron. It saves me a lot of time in the morning with the 30 second heat up feature!  The blue magic oil ic also very good. I grew up using this product.</li>
    <li> I wanted tight curls, and it was difficult to find a 1/2&amp;#34; wand.  Stand and swivel cord are good design.  Cord needs to be at least 10 Ft. Black heap protector on part of wand that you move, needs to cover all the way to angle.  It&#x27;s too easy to burn yourself with protection only at end.  I&#x27;ve used it for several months, on weekends, no problems.</li>
    <li> This is the first curling iron I have paid more than $10 for.  It heats up quickly and gets really hot, but curls quickly.  It also cools down faster.  If you have the NEED FOR SPEED and don&#x27;t burn yourself, this is great.</li>
    <li> Works fine, but don&#x27;t need it much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this curling iron.  I purchased it as a replacement for another one, and it&#x27;s worked out just fine.  Needed a small one for my short &amp;#34;summer cut&amp;#34;  and it&#x27;s all I could hope for.  Does heat up quickly, and well, so must be careful when using it so as not to burn myself.  All in all, I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> My wife has owned one of these before and is very pleased with the product!  Shipping was very prompt..</li>
    <li> excellent! heats quickly and cools off quickly</li>
    <li> Great curling iron.  heats fast.  cord swivels so it does not get tangled.  I place mine in a hanging oven mitt after use.  Handy to retrieve.</li>
    <li> No way to travel with his since one cannot use a transformer when traveling or living in another country.&lt;br /&gt;This product only works in the states. So for all of you who do not travel, this could suit you, but not folks like me.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a small barrel to curl my recently cut short hair, at this price this seemed like a great option. Unfortunately, I wasn&#x27;t happy with this purchase at all. didnt create a defined, shiny or bouncy curl for me. Not sure if this is actually meant for african american hair and i didnt know that until i saw the packaging. my hair is more fine and this dried it out like crazy and gave me really lifeless, dull curls. did have some good features like easy heat up and auto-shut off. i will be sticking to ceramic/tourmaline hair tools for here on out.</li>
    <li> Works great and heats up quickly. Very light weight</li>
    <li> Just the size I needed and received very quickly!</li>
    <li> Great curling iron for my short straight hair. It gets really hot and the curl stays in a long time.  The larger rods do not curl my hair enough and hold like this one does.  I was tempted to get an extra one for back-up so I hope they don&#x27;t sell out before I do that. Great price too!!!</li>
    <li> I had ordered this in fear that it wouldn&#x27;t be as good as my babyliss pro iron. I was wrong. It works just as good if not better. It has never burned my hair. Just yesterday, the babybliss pro burned my hair off, so this has now become my main iron which I am perfectly OK with. It curls better even though it is a 1/2 inch. It gives me more flexibility. I will never go back to a bigger curling iron again.</li>
    <li> This thing gets hot!! Be careful because the plastic part area where you squeeze with your thumb is small and the rest is metal and it&#x27;s get hot! So don&#x27;t burn yourself. Working good so far.</li>
    <li> All I really saw was a bunch of warning instructions. About the curling iron to the point where. I began to be scared to even use it .  I got the idea that  it was super hot and dangerous.  I just  put it in a drawer. And forgot it</li>
    <li> Works fine, gets to heat quickly.</li>

    <li> I bought this as I was in need of a good curling tong and this definitely delivers!&lt;br /&gt;I got sleek bouncy curls that lasted! Only con is they are extremely hot and if turned in the wrong direction you can burn yourself very easily so be careful! :)</li>
    <li> After my last Revlon curling iron started malfunctioning after only a few months of use, I was thrilled to find one by Conair... my previous Conair lasted for years!  It heats instantly, has the perfect holding strength in the clip and does a very professional job.  Unlike the Revlon, when I use product in my hair, this one doesn&#x27;t stick.  I would have rated it a full five stars, however, I agree with one reviewer who complained about the tip being too small.  I&#x27;m right handed, so I hold the tip with my left hand to wound each curl... and I&#x27;m constantly burning my thumb.  If only the rubber tip were a little longer... another example in today&#x27;s market of &amp;#34;pay more, get less.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Makes wonderful curls...heats up quickly.  Nice for all hair types and lenths. Used on my extentions andd my real hair. Nice</li>
    <li> It gives the appearance of being cheap but it is lightweight, heats fast and I like where the heat settings are placed.  I hope it holds up.</li>
    <li> gets plenty hot for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom in September.  She really likes the way it works but it is already falling apart. The screw that holds the curling clip on where you open and close the curing iron is constantly coming loose.</li>
    <li> I have short hair and I purchased this item  to give me just a few curls to add to the body of my hair.  It heats up quick and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find a 1/2 inch curling iron, so I was glad to find this one. I use it every day and it works great. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to find a 1/2 inch curling iron on line. This size is so very hard to find in stores these days. NOBODY has them, and my last one died on me. But leave it to Amazon to come through. It works great! I will probably order another one soon, just to have when the time come--cause they don&#x27;t last forever.</li>
    <li> This was a christmas gift for a daughter who specifically asked to 1/2&amp;#34; curling iron.  Price was great and she was very happy with this product and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> The curling iron works extremely well.  One must be careful  to use the proper settings as it can get very hot.  But it does have a wide selection of temperatures and I would suggest not going over #5.  ALWAYS read the instructions. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my young daughters hair- the iron gets hot fast, and its perfect for tight curls and they always hold nicely. Another reason for them to love getting dolled up! (:</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my hair length. Short and wavy. When my hair goes south it is the perfect tool for a quick&lt;br /&gt;spot curl.</li>
    <li> I had trouble finding a 1/2 lnch curling iron.  this one is just fine. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is a great curling iron for short hair took mine on vacation and my daughter had a fit over it so I bought her one</li>
    <li> It does heat up quickly when all buttons are pushed. The handle does seem a little high but am getting used to it.</li>
    <li> The curls are perfect.  Very easy to handle.  As soon as they are turned on it only takes minutes to reach the temperature sitting.</li>
    <li> This product curls fantastic. Gets good and hot when I use it.</li>
    <li> The Curling Iron is as advertised and I am satisfied with the purchase.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is the best curling iron I have ever owned! It heats up rapidly and the 1/3 inch size is perfect for curling short hair. It is lightweight and easy to handle.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time keeping my hair in the iron, so the clip must not be as tight as other curling irons I have used. It does get very hot, very quickly though. So be careful with it.</li>
    <li> curls my hair just great. i like the different temperature it gets. it gets hotter</li>
    <li> I really like this curling iron. One of its best features is the speed with which it gets hot (30 seconds). I have hard to curl hair and the heat controls,1-25, give me a vast range to choose from.  I usually set it on 20, and that will keep my hair curled for 2 days as I  wash my hair every other day.  Another good feature of this curling iron is the fact that it turns off after an hour should I forget to unplug it when I&#x27;m finished using it.  I would not hesitate to buy this product again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this curling iron once every week and noticed that my hair was starting to break alot.&lt;br /&gt;I do deep conditioning 3times a week and I use henna to color the top half of my hair, so my hair wasn&#x27;t in terrible shape. I had almost no split ends and breakage due to my usage of hair saving products. (megatek, jamaican castor oil, grapeseed oil, nexxus promend, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER I decided to pay close attention when I curled my hair with this curler...&lt;br /&gt;I used the level 10 setting and noticed that alot of hair was being burned off immediately... I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because the product is made for a different hairtype, but I would not recommend this product to anyone who has straight, coarse-thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to stick to steam rollers, or even better- Helen of Troy Gold series hair curlers.</li>
    <li> I like the 1/2 inch curling iron but would like the slide temp. guide somewhere else as my thumb keeps rolling it to a higher setting.</li>
    <li> Nice curling iron.  It&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve hadsofar.</li>
    <li> This product is not worth your money. I suggest you purchase a good quality flat iron. You can get ones from Remington for just a few more dollars. This curling iron fries your hair and leaves it looking dead and dry.</li>
    <li> Gets  really  hot.  Which is why I love this curling iron.</li>
    <li> This is just like going to salon when I use these hot curlers. Love it. Great price.</li>
    <li> I bought it because I was able to get 1/2 in. I already have one but liked the automatic turn off, because there have been so many times I left the house wondering if I had unplugged  other brand one, also the Hype Hair is shorter and not as awkward to use.  I was surprised after receiving it that the brand name is Conair, why they don&#x27;t say it on the site, I can&#x27;t understand. It has 30 heat settings but cannot imagine anyone using it near that high. I only use it on number 1. I do have fine hair, but be careful and start very low as this is hot on #1.</li>
