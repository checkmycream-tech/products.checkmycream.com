<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I do not like these brushes. They do not hold the powder well, not a high bristle count. The case is great, a little tight to get open, and heavy, but nice.</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;Finish quality is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;It is soft and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful 4-piece set! I could not be more pleased.  To begin, the case is amazing! It&#x27;s both classy and elegant at the same time.  You can even get double your mileage out of it by using both of the halves at once and storing other items in one side and the brushes in the other.  Then there are the brushes themselves.  The handles are nice and solid, and the brushes are powdery soft.  I have used each of them several times now and my makeup goes on with a nice finish without looking cakey or inconsistent.  I have washed them all up once and they clean up so easily and yet dry so nicely that when they are done drying they return to the state of looking brand new.  I would recommend you buy yourself a set of these, and while you&#x27;re at it you should grab a set for a gift because you will look like a ROCK STAR when your recipient tells you that you gave her the best gift ever!  I was offered these brushes at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> These brushes blew my expectations out of the water. The handles are long (full size) and very durable. The bristles are all very soft and fluffy. I would compare the quality of these brushes to a higher end brand that costs way more. I have seen very little if any fall out, and have seen no change in quality after washing them. I uses these brushes to apply powders, setting powders, contour, and blush. The case is also very nice quality. It has two button snaps that stay closed, and is perfect for when you have to travel with the brushes.</li>
    <li> Picture does not do product any justice! I was expecting brush&#x27;s half the size, instead I revived full size brush&#x27;s. The soft feather like bristles make these brushes super soft. Yet they are strong to do the job. I would have expected to pay double the price I paid for these little beauties. Light weight but durable and attractive, almost a crime to use them.</li>
    <li> arrived like said they appear to be very nice have not used as it is a xmas present very nice case</li>
    <li> This is such a nice set for my daughter. The container keeps all of the brushes together with no fuss. So far, the hairs in the brushes have not started to fall out like others I have bought.</li>
    <li> So soft and easy to clean.  The case looks nice and travels well in my bag without crushing the brushes.  No bristles have come out yet but I&#x27;ve only had it a short time.</li>
    <li> First, thank you for the opportunity to use this great product . It is perfect in every way .</li>
    <li> This is a very valuable brush kit for make-up! And comes with the &amp;#34;professional-look&amp;#34; case, already feels like pretty! It&#x27;s also easy to store them of course!</li>
    <li> I have a horrible addiction to MAC brushed and hate to think their might be other brands that are just as great... But holy cow was I being stuck up or what?? I ordered these with a $25 off gift card from the vender and only paid $5!!! That&#x27;s one positive point to start this journey on. Thinking to myself that their is no way these will be high quality brushes. I ordered this brush set on Jan 11,15 and they were in my hands 2 days later Jan 13,15 ! That&#x27;s so quick shipping! second positive point. I open the box and find a beautiful hard leather cylinder brush case with snap closures..Amazing.. third positive point goes to the coolest brush case I now own.. last and definitely not least.... 4 huge brushes! I haven&#x27;t used all but one brush so far to apply my blush and I love it!! Can&#x27;t wait to try all these brushes!! Looking forward to doing business with this company in the future! I highly recommend this company and their products! If you want good quality brushes without breaking the bank then get a set of these! I&#x27;m going to be added my reviews to my blog. You can see it here:: http://thebeautyinsidethebox.blogspot.com/2015/01/featherstroke-makeup-brush-set-brushes.html?m&#x3D;1</li>
    <li> Super quality! I absolutely love these brushes and the container they come in is fantastic!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE them! Great quality for a value price!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love makeup and brushes are very important when you are applying it.  I tried these brushes on a whim.  I am so happy I did.  I love the case, as I travel often.  I love being able to use this when on the go so my brushes do not get damaged.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes themselves are very soft.  I used every single brush in this kit.  I like the angled brush to contour, and the fluffy brush for powder.  Those are my two favorites.  I recommend this set if you are looking to try out a few new brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to purchase this item for a discounted price.  Regardless, I love this product and would repurchase.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:59574d07b1ad6891f7c4bff0e019bd5c]]Featherstroke&#x27;s Big Brush make-up set has superior quality with a very nice stylish cylinder case. The cylinder case is color black with Featherstroke embossed on it. It is made of synthetic leather and made well. It is very sturdy that it really protects the brushes well inside it under any circumstances. When I opened it, It definitely exceeded my expectation of the brushes. I was stunned and overwhelmed to have owned such beautiful soft brushes. These awesome brushes are made of a combination of natural and synthetic hair. The handles are long, comfortable to hold - ergonomic handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4 luxurious brushes are:&lt;br /&gt;- Face blender Brush- I use this for my liquid powder foundation. It blends evenly on my face. It is also very soft and has nice bristles.&lt;br /&gt;- Powder Brush- I use this for my powder when I need to retouch my make-up. Sometimes, I use it for my loose powder when I&#x27;m in a hurry. I like the softness of the bristles when it touches my face. It&#x27;s vanity pleasure!&lt;br /&gt;- Foundation Brush- I use this brush for my liquid foundation, liquid CC Cream and BB Cream. It evenly spreads the liquid foundation on my face- side of face, forehead, chin, cheeks and then my nose then to my neck.&lt;br /&gt;- Angled Contour Brush- I use this brush for shaping and blending powders, bronzers and blushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have MAC brush like the Powder brush of Featherstroke and I couldnt really find the difference between them. This is by far my favorite set of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a superior set of brushes that I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for an honest opinion.</li>
    <li> All 4 big brushes come in a beautiful container that immediately catches your eye when you first see it! I was extremely impressed with the quality and ease of use of each of the brushes. All of the brushes are easy to wash and each provide a flawless finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One can clearly see that Featherstroke provides amazing quality brushes and this would certainly make for an ideal gift as possibly a starter set that is easy to transport in the effective container designed specifically for all of the big brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set is fantastic and I would highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> love these and shipping was fast</li>
    <li> What a magnificent discovery, it is called the ultimate BIG brush set it is not called this for nothing!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The set comes in a handy cylinder case, which I have not experienced, and it allows me to keep the brushes protected from damage.&lt;br /&gt;The powder brush is soft, light and fluffy for the ultimate powder application experience. The foundation brush is perfect for applying foundation. The angled contour brush is perfect for highlighting cheek bones and other areas on the face. The concealer brush is designed to create the perfectly smooth and even finish.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are easily cleaned, resilient and good value.</li>
    <li> There is no other way to say it, these brushes are AMAZING! By far the best I have ever used! The fibers are softer than any other and do not fall out during use or while washing them. Caring for these brushes is super easy and after cleaning, they return back to the exact same texture and incredible soft touch! The case is chic, elegant and convenient! I&#x27;ll never go back to my old brushes, FEATHERSTROKE ROCKS!</li>
    <li> I am a makeup artist that has worked in the industry for the past 10 years.  I do a lot of movies and stills for magazines and glowing dewy skins are what you want to achieve.  With the ultimate big brush set I can do just that, my favourite brush in this set is the multi-function brush.  I can blend the foundation into the skin to get flawless finish, with not too much effort at all.  This is definitely a good buy.  Claudia Hamman  [...]</li>
    <li> Great set.  brushes are very nice and the case is wonderful and very nice looking.  The brushes are very soft and work beautifully.  The s piece set comes in a round leather bond case and looks really professional.  This would make a great gift or addition to your beauty regimen.  I did received this at a discounted rate for my honest unbiased review and they are wonderful.</li>
    <li> its very very good for this price. Cant complain, i feel though that it could be more dense so it can pick up more make-up. havent had time to use all of it yet but the angled medium brush is done well and is smaller than i expected. light and airy.</li>
    <li> These brushes are perfect!!! I have my favorite brushes now!!! Very worth the price!!!</li>
    <li> So being a girl and loving make-up accessories the Featherstroke brushes are by far the best. I have tried out numerous make-up brushes but nothing compares to the quality and the luxury of these brushes. When applying foundation using the Foundation Brush it creates a smooth, even and flawless look – a look which none of the previous brushes I have used before were able to do.  I am also very impressed with the Powder Brush. It allows me to determine the application of the powder leaving me in control. Thank you for introducing me to Featherstroke. Rozanne Ras</li>
    <li> The first thing that struck me about this product was presentation, the brush container is absolutely stunning and it is so ideal and practical to keep your brushes in. I keep all my brushes in this container... its perfect! Speaking from experience this brush set is a great gift or started set. This set allows me to achieve an absolutely flawless nude look everyday!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s case is very good&lt;br /&gt;and brush is very smooth</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! Great quality. I haven&#x27;t had any hairs falling out like you have with some of the cheaper brushes. The case is also nice and easy to travel with. Will recommend to friends!</li>
    <li> Soft touch. My wife love it :D</li>

    <li> Soft and has a great grip</li>
    <li> Thank you for the nice offer. It&#x27;s really useful</li>
    <li> Eh, These brushes are just OK. They are definitely not my first choice when reaching for my makeup brushes. The powder brush is pretty much useless unless you are using it for a setting powder.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!  Great quality, and nice packaging.  Could not be happier.</li>
    <li> Nice little makeup brushes. Love the storage case.</li>
    <li> Bought these brushes as a gift for madame and glad I did . She says they are the best brushes for the price and will tell her friends to buy the same . thank you for such fine products .</li>
    <li> I really love these brushes and for the money, you can&#x27;t beat them. I love the carrying case and will use these when I travel. Some brushes have an issue with chemical smells right out of the box but these did not. I washed them and they held up nicely. There has been no fallout with these, either. They pick up product and blend nicely while not wasting anything. I recommend these, for sure!</li>
    <li> Good quality!! So is a practical thing.</li>
    <li> Travel brush sets, on the whole, are crummy. The handles are too short, the manufacturers make no effort with the brush, and they last about as long as a two week vacation. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much with these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong! These are superb!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the cylinder that holds them is NICE. I mean, really nice, very high quality. It&#x27;s large and closes with two snaps. You can easily store your brushes, all the brushes you&#x27;re likely to need on a trip. It also makes a great container at home to keep brushes dust-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the brushes! Just amazing. Great handles, easy to use, and the bristles are just incredible. Soft, well formed, no fallout. They work great, and what&#x27;s interesting is I can&#x27;t pick a favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this brushes at an uber inexpensive price, but they were easily worth the regular price, plus. I can&#x27;t recommend them highly enough!</li>
    <li> OMG, I LOVE these brushes!  Great buy and super soft.  And the case is my favorite part!</li>
    <li> Beautiful case and the brushes are high quality!</li>
    <li> Nice set, love the case. The brushes are well made, no shedding. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> great !! High quality and sturdy case for an affordable price!! I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with them :D At first I was thinking on giving them as a gift but I will keep them and buy anothe brush set :) If you have any doubt on purchasing them think about this is a really good product. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this brush set. It feels great on the skin, very soft and is just like (if not better) than my other expensive brushes!</li>
    <li> I quite like these brushes.  They are big, fluffy &amp; soft &amp; all do their jobs nicely.  I reach for them often.  Their only downfall is some, especially the stippling brush, are still shedding after several washes.</li>
    <li> Love theses brushes.  The packing is really great too.  They are soft but firm.  Seem good quality and work well when using.  Lost a few hairs initially but that&#x27;s normal.  Will be repurchasing for gifts. I did receive these at a discount or for free in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for, the quality of the bristles on the brushes apparently aren&#x27;t to my wife&#x27;s liking. &#x3D;(</li>
