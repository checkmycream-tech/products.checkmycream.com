      <li>This is THE best product in the WORLD (imo) for quickly healing new piercings!</li>

      <li>It kept me from touching it</li>
      <li>I use this for many rejecting piercings as well as already entering stage infections for piercings I have and that includes scratches and on occasion burns.</li>
      <li>Not my favorite...</li>
      <li>It kept me from touching it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>By the time I got this, my piercing had mostly healed over.</li>
      <li>it just rinses out bacteria and allows your body a better fighting chance to heal.</li>
      <li>So yeah I recommend it. :)</li>
      <li>either way it did a lot more than I thought</li>
      <li>great for cleaning up new piercings.</li>
      <li>Used it on my triple helix/tragus cartilage peircings and it didn&#x27;t dry them&lt;br /&gt;Out and they healed wonderfully</li>
      <li>,I use wound wash up too quickly and it gets kind of costly..</li>

      <li>This stuff is so easy to use and take on the go.</li>

      <li>and I don&#x27;t have to worry about touching my piercing n order to clean it.</li>
      <li>I like the spray because it made application easy.</li>
      <li>Excellent product for little girls...</li>
      <li>bad).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve witnessed others using this on piercings, and it does a fantastic job of cleaning crusties while keeping hands off.</li>
      <li>Also h2o ocean cleanser is more economical and it lasts a lot longer than the Saline wound  </li>
      <li>gentle &amp; effective.</li>
      <li>and once I started using this spray, I noticed a significant difference in pain/sensitivity.</li>
      <li>Also, the small bottle is the perfect size.</li>
      <li>Then, I&#x27;d just use a swab to wipe the piercing clean.</li>
      <li>nice natural item.</li>
      <li>and I took care of it using the old fashioned sea salt, shot glass and warm water method.</li>
      <li>(monday)i had to wait an extra 5 days to get it.. and the way it was packed wasn&#x27;t really that great.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t get any infections and healed up fairly quickly.  </li>
      <li>good stuff fast and ez, i will sure buy more in the near future.</li>
      <li>Every time I change my piercings out I clean the ring with the H2Ocean first, then use the H2Ocean to clean my nose piercing, then I insert the ring.</li>
      <li>Great to use on new piercings and not have to do the full sea soak when you&#x27;re short on time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product in that it works better than other sprays/rinses, but the spraying mechanism leaves much to be wanted.</li>
      <li>Maybe it was running out in the first place or it&#x27;s not even the original liquid inside</li>
      <li>He turned put to be 100% right.</li>
      <li>This product healed my irritated ears right away.  </li>
      <li>I applied it to my nose piercing right away, and saw results immediately.</li>
      <li>If I may, I would like to strongly urge that you purchase it directly from Amazon - even if the cost might be higher.</li>
      <li>It really does help get rid of it within a day!</li>
      <li>Even after the first couple uses, I noticed a difference.</li>
      <li>It does exactly as it says.</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it claims to do.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Although I must say I didn&#x27;t think when getting 1.5 oz, as its pretty much one weeks worth of solution.</li>
      <li>I got my first Cartlidge piercing I bought a can from the piercer.</li>
      <li>if I get any more piercings, definitely reccomend this.  </li>
      <li>Amy ;)</li>
      <li>and you can get a gentle or powerful stream.</li>
      <li>AND THIS HELPED OUT A WHOLE LOT!  </li>
      <li>Works really well and stops infections right away.</li>
      <li>After only 2 days its no longer red or sore I am so happy with the results so far!!</li>
      <li>MUST HAVE PRODUCT FOR NEW PIERCINGS!!   </li>
      <li>Highly upon highestly recommend this stuff!</li>
      <li>i have noticed healing much fast then when I used the salt water wash.</li>
      <li>I have read that it is really the heat that draws the infection out.  </li>
      <li>SHipped fast.</li>
      <li>so this really helps  heal faster</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Definitely helped my ears a lot. Even after the first couple uses, I noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> I recently got my septum pierced again after negligence with aftercare the first go round and must say say this makes the process of cleaning it much easier. I went a week without it and other methods weren&#x27;t as effective and just couldn&#x27;t keep the discharge down but this cut it down after a couple of uses.&lt;br /&gt;Although I must say I didn&#x27;t think when getting 1.5 oz, as its pretty much one weeks worth of solution.</li>
    <li> Great product for piercing aftercare. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The bottle came broken, the sprayer did not work and I was unable to even use this. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and I recently bought this in the travel size so I can bring it with me on vacation. It came on time, the only problem was that when I receieved it in the mail, the package was COMPLETELY open. IT could&#x27;ve fallen out at any time during shipment. I&#x27;m not sure whether it was FedEx&#x27;s fault or the seller, but i&#x27;ll be cautious next time I buy.</li>
    <li> I have had my naval pierced for 5 days now, and I have had H2Ocean for 2 days. I started using as soon as it came in the mail, and at the time my piercing was still red and sore, like expected. After only 2 days its no longer red or sore I am so happy with the results so far!! I also have my cartilage pierced, I have had it for a year and a half and I still had problems with it getting infected, it would hurt to where I couldnt lay my head on on a pillow, I used H2Ocean for the past 2 days also, and it too is healing and no longer sore.     THIS IS A MUST HAVE PRODUCT FOR NEW PIERCINGS!!   **I would reccomend ordering before you get pierced so you have it from the beginning.</li>
    <li> nice natural item. bought it for after piercing but also use it for scrapes and cuts. works great and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this works.  I have always had loose sea salt that I add to very, very warm water before applying to my painful piercings.  I have read that it is really the heat that draws the infection out.  While that is still my #1 method of choice, this solution seems to work just as well! Really amazing for being room temperature.  I also appreciate the spray applicator.</li>
    <li> This item was incredibly convenient for healing both a bridge piercing and a conch piercing. The can is very convenient in that it is pressure sensitive and you can get a gentle or powerful stream. I liked to spray this onto the piercings and let it soak in for a minute. Then, I&#x27;d just use a swab to wipe the piercing clean. It was also incredibly good at soothing irritated piercings. When my conch would get irritated after washing it in the shower, I could spray a little on and let it dry; the irritation would be instantly gone! I am ordering this again.</li>
    <li> I use this for many rejecting piercings as well as already entering stage infections for piercings I have and that includes scratches and on occasion burns. It&#x27;s a bit of a miracle product and sense there&#x27;s no alcohol it doesn&#x27;t kill white blood cells that are trying to fight the infection in a open wound it just rinses out bacteria and allows your body a better fighting chance to heal. I highly recommend this product over all else for healing and will continue to buy it as I have done for years now.</li>
    <li> This spray is amazing! I ended up not going through with the piercing I planned on getting but decided to keep the bottle of H2Ocean because some of the other reviews I saw on here about it helping with acne. It really does help get rid of it within a day! Amazing!</li>
    <li> I got this because of a recommendation that it helps ease piercings on. I have a stubborn nose piercing and I switch between an L-shaped stud and a hoop. I&#x27;ve never had problems getting the stud on but the hoops can be difficult. The hoop I have goes on from the inside. Every time I change my piercings out I clean the ring with the H2Ocean first, then use the H2Ocean to clean my nose piercing, then I insert the ring. It goes on so smoothly thanks to this stuff. Also, this stuff cleans without using the harsh chemicals that can sometimes irritate peoples piercings. Great stuff. Also, the small bottle is the perfect size. No need for the bigger one (at least not for me).</li>
    <li> after one day of using this, the nozzle broke and now doesn&#x27;t work at all. i won&#x27;t be buying from this brand again.</li>
    <li> It feels nice but you can do the same thing with a small spray bottle save your money and skip this product</li>
    <li> the product works great, but it was suppose to be at my house on thursday and just came today (monday)i had to wait an extra 5 days to get it.. and the way it was packed wasn&#x27;t really that great. it came in a box that was only held together with one piece of duct tape and there was nothing else in the box - no bubble wrap, packing peanut, ect. i guess it doesn&#x27;t really need it though.. but all in all it&#x27;s a great cleaner but everything else wasn&#x27;t too great.</li>
    <li> the piercing spray of choice</li>
    <li> Works really well and I don&#x27;t have to worry about touching my piercing n order to clean it. I can just spray it and wipe away the little crusties with no problem</li>
    <li> I got this product cuz the home remedy was not doing the job. It&#x27;s very convenient and it did the job.</li>
    <li> love it! Used it on my triple helix/tragus cartilage peircings and it didn&#x27;t dry them&lt;br /&gt;Out and they healed wonderfully, I had NO infections and this was all I used</li>
    <li> After getting my cartilage pierced, the guy who did my peircing recommended I try this product and said that it would help reduce the risk of my peircing getting infected and would help it heal faster. He turned put to be 100% right. It may not work for some people but my peircing healed in no time and it was relatively pain free.</li>
    <li> Always love to use this! Perfect for my healed navel and my still healing vch.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff .when I got my first Cartlidge piercing I bought a can from the piercer. she recommended mixing some salt water of my own at home to save money. But  I like the H2O Ocean Spray a lot better then mixing my own stuff.  it comes in a spray can and lasts  a lot longer. I found H2O Oceanspray here on Amazon and it&#x27;s cheaper to buy it on here even with the shipping .it&#x27;s great stuff .I think it is so much easier to use than saltwater soaks (especially on my rook and helix, and tragus piercings.) I have four healing piercings in  each ear ( a total of eight altogether- double helix ,forward helix, and tragus piercing in my left ear and rook piercing , and a triple helix piercings on my right ear)so using wound wash saline solution takes  a lot of money to buy the stuff ,as I have so many piercings to clean ,I use wound wash up too quickly and it gets kind of costly.. Also h2o ocean cleanser is more economical and it lasts a lot longer than the Saline wound  cleanser and I think the h2o spray helps the piercings heal quicker .I will go back to using this from the using the saline wound wash. the H2O Ocean Spray lasts a lot long time even spraying all my piercings. It is hard to soak your upper ears in the salt water soaks  without getting water in your your ear canal. even though I do those two but not as often when I&#x27;m being lazy .much easier to spray and clean your piercings with this.</li>
    <li> Really seemed to speed up the healing process, would highly recommend purchasing for your new piercings.&lt;br /&gt;use 2-3 times daily.</li>
    <li> This is literally the best thing ever to use for piercings, I used it for stretching my ears. It helped my ears heal faster &amp; was easy to use</li>
    <li> Great to use on new piercings and not have to do the full sea soak when you&#x27;re short on time. Helped all my piercings heal fast and never had any issues</li>
    <li> IF YOU HAVE A PIERCING THIS IS A MUST-HAVE PRODUCT TO TAKE CARE OF IT PROPERLY. WITHOUT IT, THE INCREASE FOR INFECTION OF THE SIGHT IS MEGA-FOLD.</li>
    <li> I was gauging my ears for the first time and getting to the thick part of the taper was the hardest. After pushing it through, it burnt like crazy. It was so red to the point of it being numb when I tried to touch it. I sprayed it with this as soon as I can and wow it definitely cooled it down! After about 2 more sprays and waited about 30 minutes, it was no longer burning or numb. It still hurts to touch but thats expected, either way it did a lot more than I thought and this stuff is great! Hopefully it&#x27;ll last me awhile!</li>
    <li> Used this a few times on my piercings and pimples. Works really well and stops infections right away. Recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> This is a product I buy whenever I get a new piercing or if I want to keep germs out. I reccomend this to anyone who has a piercings! This will help them heal a lot quicker!</li>
    <li> Worked great.. Would definitely recommend it..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this stuff. I use it for everything, piercing care, sore throats, acne, cuts, basically anything I want to be sterile and cleaned.</li>
    <li> Worked great for my belly button piercing!  Soothed it when it would start to hurt. Bought a travel size one too!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product in that it works better than other sprays/rinses, but the spraying mechanism leaves much to be wanted. Stopped spraying but there is still a considerable amount of product in the can.</li>
    <li> My piercing hasn&#x27;t healed well with the saline I was using. I started using this two days ago and I&#x27;m already seeing great results!</li>
    <li> This stuff worked wonders on my belly button piercing! I highly recommend it for infected piercings because it helped mine considerably. I just washed my piercing once a day with unscented antibacterial bar soap then used the H2Ocean 3 times a day and now the infection is gone.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading the numerous positive reviews. Having received it and used on a cartilage piercing, I can say that it works like a charm. I recently had the jewelry in my external cartilage piercing changed out and although  I&#x27;ve had the piercing for more than a decade, it was not happy after the jewelry change. It was swollen, tender, red and started to weep. Within a day of using H2Ocean, the tenderness and redness were gone and it was no longer swollen and weepy. Three days later, the piercing is well on its well to healing. I would recommend this product and will definitely keep it on hand going forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for not giving the product a 5-star review is the dispenser. The spray was a bit on the messy side and tough to aim precisely. I would have preferred it to be in a bottle with a dropper dispenser.</li>
    <li> Used this for my second set of lobe piercings, and they healed much faster than the first ones did... I like the spray because it made application easy.</li>
    <li> Did the job helping with my piercings, may have had a slight reaction to it but, all is well now.</li>
    <li> I have several piercings and have used H2Ocean since the first puncture. Works great! Recently got a new one and I like to carry a 1.5 oz can in my purse so I can spray it on when needed.</li>
    <li> I had my first large (for me) tattoo done on my upper arm a few years ago, and my artist highly recommended this spray for aftercare.&lt;br /&gt;This spray accomplished several feats at once.&lt;br /&gt;1. It kept me from touching it.&lt;br /&gt;2. It was always sterile coming out of the can&lt;br /&gt;3. It kept me from touching it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without this spray, I would&#x27;ve wanted to wash it myself, which I would have overdone.  The saline both soothes fresh ink and calms when it starts to itch like crazy. It&#x27;s almost impossible to overdo it (unless you&#x27;re  rinsing scabs off, that&#x27;s bad).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve witnessed others using this on piercings, and it does a fantastic job of cleaning crusties while keeping hands off.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have the best experience because I purchased two sprays at a time and one would not work. Other than that, I highly recommend this product for piercings. It definitely will help with infection and healing.</li>
    <li> I just received my spray yesterday afternoon. I applied it to my nose piercing right away, and saw results immediately. I hope to see a completely healed piercing, free of nose bump, in the next few days.</li>
    <li> This worked horriblely for me.. I got a horrible allergic reaction..but it might work for you just not for me :/</li>
    <li> Excellent product for little girls...</li>
    <li> This product healed my irritated ears right away.  I&#x27;ve struggled with my piercings since day one, especially when I wear backs that are not sterling silver.  I so wish I had known about it and recommend it as a must buy for anyone getting a new piercing.</li>
    <li> good stuff fast and ez, i will sure buy more in the near future. thank you !!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  Ive been using it for my new;y pierced tragus, and it is helping my healing process very nicely.  It also helps with other things rather than cleaning a piercing.  It can help with acne, pink eye, cuts, sore throat, and many other things, so once your piercing or whatever is healed, you can use it for other things.  Also it is just a natural simple salt solution, so it doesn&#x27;t have any stuff that have long questionable names either.</li>
    <li> Not impressed at all! Product didn&#x27;t seem to help with piercings almost seemed to make it worse and dry (hurt) had to stop using and switch to another product, didn&#x27;t work good for me</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast, but the product is defective. The pump doesn&#x27;t spray &amp; I feel like there&#x27;s barely any product in it. Maybe it was running out in the first place or it&#x27;s not even the original liquid inside &amp; it broke so somebody decided to sell it on here to fool people.</li>
    <li> Came in handy! It&#x27;s helped my piercings heal nicely. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Had recently gotten a cartilage piercing, and was using sea salt and water at home. It was messy, and inconvenient. H2Ocean is less messy, and within 5 minutes of application, it feels as if the soreness has been drawn out. Have been using for 5 days, and finally my piercing is starting to heal after 16 days.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I was expecting. Didn&#x27;t seem to do much since it just runs off. I suggest buying some sea salt, mixing it with just enough water to make a loose paste and putting it on your piercing for 3-5 minutes then rinsing it off. It is cheaper, and I found it more effective.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from my piercer and ran out. I found this online, 6 dollars cheaper than what he charged me for it. I was extremely impressed with the speed of shipping. I use this constantly on my piercings and for other skin issues. Plan on buying again when I run out.</li>
    <li> My daughter got this and she loves it. She said it really helps her ears when she is moving up her gauges in size.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It does exactly as it says. Never had soreness or infection after using this product.</li>
    <li> I was getting little bumps around my  belly button after getting it pierced. Once I purchased this product it and used it daily everything has been fine and my piercing is healed! I got this in June and I still has not run out.</li>
    <li> great for cleaning up new piercings. gentle &amp; effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this isn&#x27;t sold locally but this is the best thing to use for piercings. My daughter looked everywhere.</li>
    <li> love it is works great. I have a belly  ring so this really helps  heal faster so if you are looking for something get this</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it claims to do.  Got my ears pierced and used this as directed. Didn&#x27;t get any infections and healed up fairly quickly.  Will use this again if I get any more piercings, definitely reccomend this.  SHipped fast.</li>
    <li> Great ,Helps Alot With Piercings</li>
    <li> Got my belly button pierced when I was 18 and I took care of it using the old fashioned sea salt, shot glass and warm water method. Suddenly it got infected, leaving me with a giant painful abscess. I was told I should take it out and get it pierced again. Since I did not want to pay for another piercing I decided to not listen to the person and purchase this product based on a friends recommendation . Within a week the infection was gone after using it twice a day. This stuff is so easy to use and take on the go.</li>
    <li> I have used this spray for a few days and I love it  i have noticed healing much fast then when I used the salt water wash.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing i dislike, besides the fact that i thought it was gonna be bigger but that&#x27;s my bad for not realizing that it&#x27;s only 1.5 fluid ounces. So yeah I recommend it. :)</li>
    <li> Using 3-6 times per day for nose piercing, the only crappy part about it is that it dries out surrounding skin and is for some reason making me break out in the area too, I wish there was some kind of funnel or filter so it just sprays on the piercing</li>
    <li> I recently got my nipple pierced and once I started using this spray, I noticed a significant difference in pain/sensitivity. It was recommended that I get this spray by my piercer and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
    <li> By the time I got this, my piercing had mostly healed over. I&#x27;ve heard really good things about it, though, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be of great help if I ever pierce anything else! (;</li>
    <li> Excellent easy to use, portable, helps the piercing heal faster.  When I run out (the bottle is travel sized mini&#x27;s. However I only spray a little bit at a time. So I think this is gonna last me at least another Month or so.</li>
    <li> This is THE best product in the WORLD (imo) for quickly healing new piercings! I used it only 3X a day on my belly button, and it healed in LESS than 6 months!! WHAAAA?? I KNOW! Highly upon highestly recommend this stuff! PS If I may, I would like to strongly urge that you purchase it directly from Amazon - even if the cost might be higher. You can thank me later ~ Amy ;)</li>
    <li> I liked the product but I felt like the price was high for the amount of product. I can buy regular saline for half the price and twice as much. I did like the aerosol part because regular saline is a squeeze bottle.</li>
    <li> I got this to use while stretching my ears. I found that using a $1.99 bottle of nose saline worked just as well if not better. The spray nozzle on this sprays instead of streams so it goes everywhere including into the ear canal. Not my favorite...</li>
    <li> I love this Piercing spray it does what it says will do to your piercing.  A must have for anyone that currenly has or is about to get pierced.</li>
    <li> NO COMPLAINTS ! I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY CHEEK PIERCINGS , WHICH WERE INFECTED AND THIS HELPED OUT A WHOLE LOT!  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO EVERYONE</li>
