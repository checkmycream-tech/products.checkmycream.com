<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this! Makes bath time so much more enjoyable!</li>
    <li> Beyond my expectation and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> looks very attractive.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended seller!  The caddy works perfectly with our Jacuzzi tub.  The all wood construction is solid.</li>
    <li> What I expected.  Looks nice and fits my tub.  Looking forward to my next bath.</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> A Christmas gift to my daughter, no complaints from us.The quality was as described.She loved it as she does lots of soaks through out the week for sore muscles.She props up a magazine puts a water on the tray and everything is organized.There was no problem getting it to fit her tub.</li>
    <li> Love this bamboo caddy I have extra large tub and it fits perfectly</li>
    <li> This showed up so quickly that it actually shocked me!! It fits my tub and works very well.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.  It was a gift - and recipient loved it</li>
    <li> Love that it is adjustable and fits my odd sized tub!</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my daughter and she LOVES it.</li>
    <li> Looks Amazing!! I also have a wide tub so when caddy is fuly extended it somewhat sags in the middle.  The book rack has no stops to assist the book to remain upright. If the design had placed the slats in the other direction perhaps the book would stand. The wine glass slot is a bit narrow therefore some glasses won&#x27;t fit. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it is still a terrific buy. Love that it is wood and not a metal caddy. Looks extra rich!!</li>
    <li> very happy with this bath caddy!!!</li>
    <li> wife loves it. Quality appears good. Arrived without delay. Happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I love to watch Netflix on my iPad in the bath.  This thing is awesome.  Holds my iPad securely with no worries.  Nice and heavy-duty--even if I bump it, it doesn&#x27;t tip or move.  I have a large soaking tub and it fits securely.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Product works great in the bathtub.  Can put a book or any electronic device on it and just sit back and relax.</li>
    <li> two joints fell apart and now need to be glued back together</li>
    <li> I hesitated purchasing this because it seemed like a lot of money when other bath caddies had been so disappointing in the past; however my daughter kept asking for it and the reviews were good...so, I took a chance and I am glad that I did.  It gets used quite a bit and my daughter loved it so much that I bought another one as a gift.</li>
    <li> Not very stable.  Definitely don&#x27;t trust my ipad on this thing.  My wine glass rims are all too thick for the wine holder.</li>
    <li> Hey! All you guys out there in *Amazon.com* land! Take heed &amp; pay attention!:&lt;br /&gt;  There are absolutely two (2) things I wish to share with you, as fellow customers of Amazon.com, who I respect as &amp;#34;Smart Buyers (TM)&amp;#34;:&lt;br /&gt;  1 - This product -- this &amp;#34;BAMBOO BATHTUB CADDY WITH EXTENDING SIDES&amp;#34; -- is ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE! I CAN&#x27;T WAIT to SURPRISE MY WIFE WITH IT -- before Christmas -- by BRINGING IN TO HER BATH (YES, THIS IS ROMANTIC) -- THE FOLLOWING ITEMS:&lt;br /&gt;  A - This EXCELLENT &amp;#34;Bamboo Bathtub Caddy with Extending Sides&amp;#34;, AND&lt;br /&gt;  B - A stemmed-glass of WHATEVER she desires to drink (plus, I just purchased 4 new stemmed glasses to serve her with[!]), AND&lt;br /&gt;  C - Turn on the Jacuzzi&lt;br /&gt;  D - Turn on her favorite music, AND&lt;br /&gt;  E - Leave her alone to enjoy one of the finest baths she had since we were on the cruise in the Caribbean!&lt;br /&gt;By the way, the EXCELLENT SELLER of this EXCELLENT PRODUCTS is:&lt;br /&gt;  ************ &amp;#34;ToiletTree Products&amp;#34; ************&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE! DON&#x27;T FORGET THAT NAME:&amp;#34;TOILETTREE PRODUCTS&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;Why??? For they sell a REALLY &amp; TRULY AWESOME PRODUCT! That&#x27;s why!&lt;br /&gt;And because they get it to you POST HASTE! Yes, if you are an Amazon.com &amp;#34;PRIME&amp;#34; Customer, it will be in your home in two (2) days -- with no shipping, probably no tax -- &amp; ready to serve you in YOUR Jacuzzi!&lt;br /&gt;  Have a great life!&lt;br /&gt;  Best regards,&lt;br /&gt;  KC of OK</li>
    <li> I received this product free in exchange for my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bathtub caddy solves many of my bathtime problems. First off, the caddy is adjustable to fit almost any tub. Most importantly, it makes all of my bathtime needs within reach. It features a stemware holder so I can enjoy a glass of wine or another favorite beverage during bathtime. I can read books or work on my tablet by using the book rest. There is also a cell phone slot so I don&#x27;t have to worry about missing important calls or Facebook messages. I think this is actually a slot for soap but I use it for my phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I truly want to just relax, I can use the caddy to hold candles and play music from my phone/tablet. The caddy is sturdy, well-made and looks fantastic. Most of all, it is functional! This caddy helps to make bathtime even more relaxing.</li>
    <li> Very nice caddy, just what I had been looking for. Comes with a bar that adjusts to hold your i pad or a very thick book. Has a small tray to hold your cell phone as well. I have a spa tub and the caddy fits perfectly.  Add the wine glass holder...what more could you ask for while soaking in the tub!</li>
    <li> This is nice bamboo. I have other bamboo items in our bath and it matches nicely. It stretches  across by spa tub which is big and white and breaks up the whole white tub. It also gave the warmth I was looking for the big white tub. I was staging my home for sale, and this added a really nice touch. I will use it in my new home as well. Also, the book holder works holds a book very well.</li>
    <li> My adult daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it! It fits across her huge garden tub with no problem. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Even though the box came slightly damaged, everything was still good in the real package.</li>
    <li> Wish it came with a different stain. Isn&#x27;t very &amp;#34;rustic&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s incredibly functional.</li>
    <li> I received this from my husband for Xmas. I really liked the product but ended up having to return it because it did not fit my bath tub. Your tub needs to have ledges on both sides of the tub and they need to be equivalent heights. My ledges were at different heights which provided me with a lopsided caddy that I could not place anything on. I didn&#x27;t think of this before adding this to my wish-list...hopefully this help someone else before their purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought as gift..was perfect.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Adding foam backing where it contacts the tub helps to reduce slipping.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this every time she bathes. I like how it is wide enough to fit our oversized tub.</li>
    <li> This thing is super convenient and I love it. That said, the slot for wine glasses is pretty narrow and my wine glasses that I have don&#x27;t fit in it. Also, the spot for the phone is pretty small. I have a galaxy s5 sport and it is much bigger than the slot. Not too big of a deal, though, since you can just set the stuff on top.</li>
    <li> Not a good product. The construction is bamboo, which in itself in not necessarily a bad thing, but the rails that extend out are both split on the grain. Not a very strong construction. I&#x27;m going to have to fix it with gorilla glue or something pretty strong so my wife will use it... I wish I had searched a little longer for a different product to purchase.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my parents, they love it, fits their tub perfectly!</li>
    <li> Perfect for a stand alone tub!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s absolutely beautiful and looks just the way I expected and more!  It adds pizzaze to my bathroom and I feel great when using it when bathing and having a place to put my wine, book, sponge, etc. all at my fingertips.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Good quality.  My daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> I believe it&#x27;s made well &amp; I do like it but the bar is too big to read a paper back book, hard backs are the only thing that fits.  The phone slot is also too small.  I have one of the newer larger phones which doesn&#x27;t fit.  The wine holding compartment is perfect!  Construction is very good also.  It also extended on my tub which I was worried since I have a large jetted tub.  So if you read only hard back books &amp; have an older phone, you&#x27;ll lobe it!</li>
    <li> Works great, I only use it a few times a month at most but it has gotten the job done and so far I&#x27;ve not ruined my laptop or phone. It is disappointing the wine-glass holder is so specific as my wine glasses have a thicker base but it probably does a good job at holding those types of glasses well, I just don&#x27;t have any to give a try---yet. :3 It is surprisingly solid and heavy as well, I was worried it&#x27;d be more flimsy but that wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
    <li> This is great to have for our jacuzzi tub. It fits over the widest part nicely, which I was worried about. It holds my kindle, my phone and a glass of wine with no problems. Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about setting anything on the little edge of the tub and having it fall on the floor (or worse, in the tub!).</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loved it so much she gave me some lovin</li>
    <li> Just remodeled my bathroom and had to have a caddy for my new soaker tub.  This caddy is beautiful and works great with my new tub!</li>
    <li> great product, very sturdy, looks great, functional...and the wife loves it!  Highly recommend this bathtub caddy</li>
    <li> Not bad at all. I love to relax in my tub with some wine and a book. My wine glass bottoms are too think for this holder which was kind of sad.  The little phone holder is really unnecessary, I wish it was just flat. The book holder works well and the length is really good for my tub. It was sturdy enough for my wine glass, a candle holder and a book. It was a little spendy but I like it.</li>
    <li> Love it! Only 4 stars because although it has a metal piece that supports books, I use an iPad mini and it &amp;#34;falls through&amp;#34; the gap.  Also, I drink tea, not wine, so the wine glass holder is not helpful to me.  Just a smooth , flat place for a glass or cup would be nice instead.&lt;br /&gt;But on the whole, even knowing those things, I would purchase again.  Love that it extends because I have a large soaking tub.</li>
    <li> This item has changed my life. I&#x27;m a writer and, often, my office is the bathtub. This caddy allowed me to get work done while relaxing. Which maybe defeats the purpose of relaxing, but I don&#x27;t care.</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this 10 months ago and it is already sagging in the middle.  After 5 months the rail on one side started to split, so she turned it around.  Now the other rail is splitting and I&#x27;m concerned that it will soon fail.  She has loved everything about it up until now; however, I don&#x27;t want to replace it every year.  It needs to be sturdier.</li>
    <li> I always enjoy a good bath, but this has taken the experience to the next level.  No more trying to shove my book onto the window shelf and no more attempting to balance a drink on the edge of the tub against the wall.  This is not only functional, but nice and heavy and solid as well.  It fits our big claw foot perfectly with only a little extension.</li>
    <li> Good quality product. Works well with frequent use and so far no tendency to mildew or stain.</li>
    <li> Great product! It performs just like promised. We have a big oval tub, 38 inches across and this works!</li>
    <li> This thing is limited as to how narrow it can go.  I can&#x27;t use this for my tub since my tub is really narrow.  eh whatever I can use it as firewood.</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my spouse as a Christmas gift. Product came exactly as described. Construction is solid. A+ customer service.</li>
    <li> I love this product and it&#x27;s made of high quality materials; it oozed quality as soon as I first laid eyes on it. It&#x27;s versatile, and in my opinion pretty well thought out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple suggestions that would make this product better, and the reasons I gave it 3.75 stars instead of 5::&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Needs an easy way to lock the sliding arms into place once they&#x27;re extended to the proper length for one&#x27;s bathtub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Needs some sort of non-skid surface to the underside of the ends of the arms where they sit flat on the bathtub tub ledges. This would make the product far more secure and sturdy when installed in a situation where one side of a bathtub has less of a ledge than the other. This small design addition would bring the product implementation easily into 5-star PLUS territory! I used a bit of contact cement and some perforated, rubberized non skid kitchen drawer liner to accomplish this on mine. The result is rock-solid. I&#x27;m now confident in putting my laptop, tablet, phone, coffee or whatever on this bathtub caddy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Needs to include more than one size of metal back brace to hold your book, tablet or whatever. This would allow the usage of a far greater range of devices and books. As it stands, you must be using a very large tablet or book to hold securely. This was actually my biggest personal disappointment with this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a very good product that needs a bit of refinement to take it to the next level. Still Recommended!</li>
    <li> The only thing that we had trouble with is if your tub has narrow sides or built-in shelves so there is no side, this doesn&#x27;t have any kind of rubber grip to hold on to a narrow space...otherwise it&#x27;s perfect, love it!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I am returning the caddy only because it doesn’t fit my tub, Good quality, well made, and would definitely recommend the caddy and the seller was excellent to work very prompt</li>
    <li> The caddy seems to be well made and is very pretty.  The only issue for me is that I use a Kindle to read books and the book rest is a little too wide consequently my Kindle falls through.  I believe I can remedy this problem without too much trouble.  All in all I believe it to be a good buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife. She loves it and I am very glad I made the purchase.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality. I am returning this item and am grateful for Amazon&#x27;s easy return policy. Definitely do not buy - a waste of money and it is not even cheap to begin with!</li>
    <li> THIS WAS A GIFT TO MY DAUGHTER.  SHE LIKED IT.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit - even for a narrow tub. Just be sure to cover the camera(s) on your electronics so that hackers/NSA can&#x27;t get pictures of your naughty-bits! ;-)</li>
    <li> The caddy arrived in a very timely manner.  It is of a good quality, is sturdy and looks just like it does in the pic.  We have used several times already.</li>
    <li> I am delighted with this caddy.  It looks fabulous and expands to any size tub.  It&#x27;s highly functional.  I do agree with one of the other&lt;br /&gt;reviewers that some kind of rubber footing would have been nice as it can slide around if you&#x27;re not careful.  But when all is said and done&lt;br /&gt;this is a fantastic product for the money.</li>
    <li> This caddy more than met my expectations.  It&#x27;s well made, attractive and very functional.  Because it&#x27;s adjustable, it works perfectly in my tub, whether I want to rest it in the notch below the handholds or on the wider, flat areas on either side of those notches.  The book/laptop holder works great for me, too.</li>
    <li> Fits in my tub perfectly. I did add plastic grips to the bottom to keep it from sliding the little bit that it does.</li>
    <li> It works. Nothing complex here.</li>
    <li> The tub caddy arrived within a couple of days. It is a quality beautiful caddy. It fits perfect on my new clawfoot bath tub.</li>
    <li> this is delightful, I keep all my bath accessories on it and it never slips very stable.</li>
    <li> this is pretty good for the price. a little splintery though so be careful getting it out of the box. I cleaned mine up a bit with a pocket knife and now it works great.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it the picture does it no justice it looks flimsy in the picture it is not and it is very nice and sturdy :-)</li>
    <li> I no longer fear dropping my Kindle in the bath water as I&#x27;m watching a movie or reading a book. This is a great product! Fits my tub perfectly and even allows me to keep a drink close by.</li>
    <li> Love the look.  Very long so it fits across my Jacuzzi.  Sturdy.  Just what I wanted and a very good price.</li>
    <li> Caddy is really nice; perfect for using in the bath when I want a minute to myself. I have yet to use the wine glass holder but everything else works great and is wide enough to fit over my big spa tub.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, had a couple of wood chips visible on top.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband &amp; he loved it until he tried to use it with a wine glass.  We have a few different styles of glasses with stems and not one would fit in the slot because it was not open enough to hold the bottom of the glass.  We had to return it.</li>
    <li> use every time I take a bath only down side is my iPad doesn&#x27;t fit with the case on...</li>
    <li> Great gift from my husband. I love it and it works great with my clawfoot tub.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I wanted, and I got it delivered as promised.  It is a very nice quality and it looks beautiful on my bathroom.  This has completed the spa environment look that I was going for!  I will now be able to enjoy a good book, wine while taking a rejuvenating bubble bath!</li>
    <li> This caddy is a good size for my oversize tub and can convert down to use on the regular tub in the kids room. It is sturdy, easy to use and nice looking. I love it. Fast shipping from this vendor too.</li>
    <li> Love this!!!  Very durable, I use it for my iPad/wine, or books/whine!  LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> My fiances loves it. I got her a new book, some bubble bath and a bottle of wine. Great Sunday afternoon for her</li>
    <li> Worked as expected for my wife.</li>
    <li> This thing is not worth the money at all. It doesn&#x27;t sit on the tub very securely and when my toddler son bumped it, it dropped and broke apart. Never even got to use it. Very flimsy product for 50 bucks. Stay away.</li>
    <li> Very well made.  We have a slipper tub and it is a little wider than we would have liked as we hit our knees on it.  That is probably the only type of tub that would be a problem.  We didn&#x27;t return it because we can use it easily in our other bathroom when it is complete.</li>
    <li> My bath caddy arrived with one broken slide out. The silver metal piece (book holder) was also missing. I am Not buying any more ToiletTree Products. That is all.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she LOVE&#x27;S it. Works perfect in our normal size bathtub.</li>
    <li> Overall, very happy with purchase. Bought for Christmas gift. Paid about $40. Good construction. Does slide a bit on the bathtub, but I fixed that with small self-stick nylon.rubber pads that cost $3 at Home Depot--I think they are meant to keep cabinet doors from banging when they close. The metal book stand will not support a Kindle Fire on its side (it will fall right through), but it will support the Kindle just fine in an upright position. The wine glass holder is on the left, so might be a little awkward if you are right handed.</li>
    <li> The idea of this caddy seemed great but in terms of actual functionality it falls short. The book/magazine rack doesn&#x27;t really hold anything up on its own (you still need one or two hands to hold it up) and the angle is wrong for reclining in the tub. The wine holder is a waste of space unless you are using it with a wine glass with exactly the right sized base. Didn&#x27;t live up to expectations.</li>
    <li> The Tray was good...need to place washcloth or something on slats to keep books or readers from sliding down....The problem I did&lt;br /&gt;have was my tub is deep....so had to rig hangers to get tray to proper height...DUH</li>
    <li> Nice product. Only suggestion would be to put slip resistant plastic tabs on the corners. Got exactly what I expected. Thanks</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful product. I have a large tub and the extensions work perfectly. The bamboo is lovely and I like buying sustainable products. It has everything you could want to make a luxurious bath even better…wine glass holder, iPhone caddy, book stand. What more can a girl ask for? The only thing that could make this product better is some kind of legs on each side to use if your tub sides are uneven. My tub has a seat on one side, so I have to prop a towel on one side to make the caddy even. Still…would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> I bought this caddy as part of my wife&#x27;s birthday gift. As soon as she saw it, she loved it and put it to use that night. Everything worked just as advertised. The problems began on her second use. After she finished her bath, one of the retractable slides completely fell apart. The finish nails that were holding everything together came loose and fell out. The product is a great concept but for only two uses, I&#x27;m extremely disappointed...</li>
    <li> Product is well made but book stand is key feature and it is worthless. Needs to hecredesigned so it is more upright and is located at the front of the caddy.&lt;br /&gt;This design only works if you are sitting upright with your chest well above the level of the caddy.&lt;br /&gt;If your tub is designed so you can be slightly recumbent this wont work for you.</li>
    <li> After one year, this product has held up very well, better than I expected. I have enough space for a heavy book, it will hold a large glass of wine, and also holds a glass soap dish and other bath products without sagging or other issues. Will buy using this vendor again.</li>
    <li> I received my bath caddy in a very timely manner.  It is a great product.  The wood is very sturdy, it expands out nicely and still remains stable even when fully expanded.  I&#x27;m able to read a book or use my iPad without fear of it taking a swim.  I also like the wine glass holder.  Very nice product that I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Remodeling our entire home, and soon listing it...purchased these for \\&quot;staging\\&quot; but they are so great that both my husband and I use them everytime we shower/bathe! They are wonderful and work great AND are beautiful!!!</li>
    <li> I really love it. It was delivered within the 2 days I expected and it does exactly what I need it to.  The price seemed a little high but it is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> It shipped fast and extends to be a perfect fit on my wide bathtub. It&#x27;s ideal for a great bath!</li>
    <li> This bathtub caddy is just what I wanted.  It is well made and looks very nice in our bathroom.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome to place your kindle or tablet on while in the tubbie!  Love it!</li>
    <li> This tray turned out to be exactly what I was looking for.  I live in a very warm, humid area, and a metal tray rusts, regardless of what type of metal it&#x27;s made from.  So the bamboo was an ideal solution.  I have an odd shaped tub with one side higher than the other, and the expandable sides allowed for putting a small plastic block on one side of the tub so that I can have the tray level.  The bookstand works well, but I have poor eyesight and the distance is a little too far for me -- I need it closer.  But that problem was solved with a clear plastic stand-up clipboard that I put in the edge of the tray nearest me -- fits perfectly and holds my reading material at exactly the right distance for reading in the tub.  I like a large mug of lemonade while I&#x27;m soaking in the tub, so the stemware holder didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  Instead, I put a coaster over the opening, and I now have the perfect spot for my lemonade.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the tray and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was recently in The Maldives and a beautiful bungalow awaited our arrival.  Spread across this glorious bathtub was a teak bathtub caddy complete with products of every description.  I had such an amazing vacation that I wanted to replicate it as much as I could in my day to day life.  As soon as I got home, I wanted to find a bath caddy to display by bath oils, shampoos etc.  I began my search on Amazon and ordered two, knowing I would keep the one I liked most.  I was very excited to receive them, but when they arrived promptly from the seller, I was disappointed that this one did not give enough table space to hold what I wanted.  I will need to continue my search since I returned them both.</li>
    <li> Sides stick slightly and seems slightly flimsy, but otherwise great and perfect for my use!</li>
    <li> Well designed and well made</li>
    <li> Use it everything I soak in the tub!  Absolutely essential for people that like to soak in the bath for long periods of time!</li>
    <li> Expandable and sturdy, it holds my wine glass, some reading material and an iPhone (for musical purposes only!) while I soak in a hot bath...life is good.</li>
    <li> I love this caddy!  Perfect for holding magazines and my wine!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, great quality, well priced. Totally enhanced my tub. The adjusting tracks make it fit perfectly. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It is kind of cheap but the wife likes it</li>
    <li> Nice to be able view kindle straight ahead instead of looking to the side of tub.</li>
    <li> Great, sturdy product.  Holds iPad and plenty more! Has made my bathtub an oasis! Love this caddy! Really well made!</li>
    <li> I was having a terrible time finding a caddy that was wide enough for my 2 person spa tub. This fit the bill perfectly. It is very well constructed and quite lovely. No problem with stability and strength even when expanded to the maximum condition. I find the book rack works well also. Great price for a great product! Thank you so much!&lt;br /&gt;  Judy&lt;br /&gt;PS. It also works well for my husbands laptop when he lays it across the arms of his easy chair.</li>
    <li> simple, convenient and sturdy, I have been using the bamboo caddy for a few weeks now.  It is nice to finally have a caddy that will not rust.</li>
    <li> Very well made bath caddy. Easily fit my oversize tub. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give five stars is I can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s durability as I&#x27;ve only had it two weeks.</li>
    <li> Highly recommendable product!</li>
    <li> Fits over a large whirlpool tub.</li>
    <li> The phone slot isn&#x27;t very big and when you slide the sides out there&#x27;s nothing that locks them into place so that&#x27;s kind of a bummer. Also, I really wish it had something to hold the pages of the book open and in place</li>
    <li> I use this all the time in my baths. Works great with my ipad to watch movies!</li>
    <li> Great for a relaxing bath!</li>
    <li> the caddy is nicely made and fits in my Jacuzzi tub well. the only caution/complaint I have is that the description on Amazon says that there is an adjustable  bamboo bar to support an iPad. The caddy I received did not have this and appears to be the older version of this item.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and had it engraved for a gift. Great product for the overworked girlfriend.</li>
    <li> Very pretty, sturdy. Look forward to using it.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I received this as a gift from my daughter. She was very excited about getting it for me. When I received it through the mail the packaging was damaged and the item was flimsy.</li>
    <li> Adjustable so it fits easily- ability to slide in glass is a brilliant feature.  Looks good, works well, couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> The  Bathtub Caddy arrived safely and on-time. It adjusted to fit our tub perfectly. It safely holds everything you need it to.</li>
    <li> Practical and sturdy. Also makes a nice decor piece with flowers and a book laying across the tub on days you&#x27;re not trying to soak.</li>
    <li> ......to your bath.  You deserve it!  This is the perfect way to have the things near you that you need/want while you take a much deserved break.  The expansion allows for use in the wider whirlpool tubs and the bamboo will last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews for this product and decided it would be a good buy. Most people complained about the book part not doing a good job holding open the book. For me, when the item arrived, it was cracked. It wasn&#x27;t an issue with shipping but rather poor craftsmanship. Sent it back.</li>
    <li> Great quality all around. I waited like 5 months before I finally order this bath rack....the price dropped $10 :) I wish the cut out for &amp;#34;books&amp;#34; were a little wider or adjustable. I have a full sized ipad and it doesn&#x27;t fit I&#x27;m the cit out. I balance it over the cut out or on the edge.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to read a book while having a glass of wine and sitting in a bubble bath. Now I can!</li>
    <li> I ordered this at the last minute for a Christmas gift and was pleasantly surprised when arrived on Christmas eve.</li>
    <li> Great product and we LOVE it. Even fits on the other side of the tub that goes right up against the wall. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have a pretty wide jacuzzi tub and I was kind of skeptical whether or not this would fit....IT DOES! The quality of the wood is excellent, the only downside is that it slides, but other than that I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> It is the good quality and nice design. I like this bathtub caddy. Received it and my girl friend will like this gift.</li>
    <li> This caddy is perfect. It holds a glass of wine, water, my kindle and a rubber ducky. It fits my tub perfectly. Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I chose this item cos I have a fiberglas garden tub with a lip around the tub.  Most do not fit my tub.  As a last resort, I tried the bamboo caddy and absolutely love it.  The glass holder is much more secure than the others as well as the whole thing.  The soap holder I use for other things: my ring, my razor, etc.  the description that was given is true and accurate.  Would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> thank goodness for this product. I hadn&#x27;t been able to find one that would fit my tub. I love it!</li>
    <li> Everything as described, recommend seller.</li>
    <li> It is very pretty when it comes out of the package, but after the very first use, it becamse blackened, even though I wiped it down.  The wine glass holder is not useful, as it only works for a completely flat footed glass.  I like the idea of it very much, but now after use it&#x27;s almost totally blackened.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Product works as intended. It looks just like the picture, the size is just as pictured, etc. My wife uses this all the time. Her only complain is the book backstop thingy. Apparently, it does not have an adjustable angle, and it renders it somewhat useless for magazines. Books prop up just fine. Priced very appropriately.</li>
    <li> PERFECT FOR A FREE STANDING TUB.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s study and well made. A beautiful addition to our bathroom and fits nicely for our soaking tub &amp; our standard size tub in other bath (plus room to extend even further if you have a wider tub). Nice book/ tablet stand and handy wine holder. You can really escape and turn your bath into a lovely little retreat.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s well packed and shipping was SUPER fast (to AK!). LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I received this for free from ToiletTree Products to review.  No compensation was received and all opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product to review specifically for my mom on Mother&#x27;s Day.  Every night she lounges in the tub and reads.  It is the way she unwinds from the stress of the day.  The Bamboo Bathtub Caddy with Extending Sides will really make her long soak even more comfortable.  I hope my mom doesn&#x27;t mind that I used this a few times to get the feel of it.  I did like how the book supports held my book for me to read.  I did get to read the rest of my Miss Marple book while lounging away in the tub.  I also enjoyed the ambiance of the candlelight in the wine glass, and not having to worry that it would fall over.  I could really get used to it.  Perhaps mom won&#x27;t be getting this after all?</li>
    <li> PURCHASED AS A GIFT FOR MY WIFE.. SHE LOVES IT.. HAPPINESS FOR $40, WHATS NOT TO LIKE?</li>
    <li> My wife uses this almost every day, it sits perfectly across her large garden tub.</li>
    <li> beautiful design, fits my wine glass perfectly!</li>
    <li> Very good quality and design !!!&lt;br /&gt; I like it pretty much!&lt;br /&gt;Even my husband likes it  too.&lt;br /&gt;Good to buy!</li>
    <li> Easily adjustable to the width of your tub. Your drinks, iPad, or stuff sit well on platform. A definite buy again for personal or great as a gift. Not to mention it also looks great and feels pretty sturdy.</li>
    <li> This is a nice little bauble.  The book slot fits an ipad perfectly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We like it.</li>
    <li> I love this!  The bamboo tray/caddy is wonderful and adjusts to fit nicely.  However, the frame that pops up to hold the book is way too flimsy to support a big book or a paperback or an electronic reader.  It needs to be of a quality to match the tray and it isn&#x27;t.  I have to roll up a towel to support the book.  If you can fix that, you have a winner.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my daughter for Christmas, and she loves it!  She now takes a long, soaking bath every night.  Even the cat knows to look for her in the bathtub!  This caddy, a bathtub pillow, and a good book - and she&#x27;s in there until the water is cold!</li>
    <li> In the end this is that matters.  My wife loves it!!!  She takes bathes everyday and really enjoys how well it holds her books and that fact that is it adjustable as our bathtub is wide and oval.</li>
    <li> Very well constructed, and thoughtfully designed. Can fit across a wide whirlpool tub. Stand can be used with paper back and hard cover books.</li>
    <li> Got this for my girlfriend for Christmas, and she loves it. Needed some rubber feet added to the underside to keep it from slipping, and maybe something in the tray to act as a base for her ipad. Before you panic: I have a waterproof sleeve I put her ipad in and then she rests it on the book holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wine class slip is a clever idea and fits even our &#x27;half glass&#x27; wine glasses just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The depression on the other side of the main area is strangely sized to fit a 4th generation iphone fairly well, but only without a case :-/.</li>
    <li> I ordered this bathtub caddy and got the older version (the one without the adjustable bar for books/ipad). I contacted Amazon about it to get a replacement with the updated version (like I originally ordered). The replacement came today and its the same style as the first one that was delivered, the kind without the adjustable bar. So moral of the story, don&#x27;t order this item if you&#x27;re set on having the adjustable bar, because you won&#x27;t get it.</li>
    <li> Its a bath accessory it should not look this bad this fast</li>
    <li> best gift ever to someone who likes to enjoy their baths.  even sturdy enough to put a laptop on it.</li>
    <li> I really love my caddy. It&#x27;s just as pictured in the photo and fits perfectly over my bathtub. Great quality!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful, practical caddy. It was a gift for my sister, who has a large oval tub it worked out great!</li>
    <li> looks very nice and my mom loves it. we got it as a Christmas gift .</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Likes:&lt;br /&gt;– completely made out of bamboo/besides the metal support for a book or tablet&lt;br /&gt;– ready to use out-of-the-box&lt;br /&gt;– adjustable for any tub or Jacuzzi design&lt;br /&gt;– creative design to hold the glass of your favorite beverage and also a holder for your smart phone&lt;br /&gt;– easy to wash and it&#x27;s okay when it gets wet&lt;br /&gt;– holds a book or my iPad without an issue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Improvement suggestions:&lt;br /&gt;– it would help if there was some kind of rubberized backing on the adjustable arms. I find that it slides very easily especially if one side of the tub is against the wall leaving only a little bit of a lip for the caddy arm to stay on. Of course this will vary by the design of your tub or Jacuzzi&lt;br /&gt;– the metal arm that supports a book or tablet would work better if it was adjustable. It&#x27;s easy for smaller tablets or even a Kindle to fall through&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;I made this purchase because I use my Jacuzzi tub daily and I find that I&#x27;m usually holding my phone or iPad. This caddy makes it easy to rest these items right in front of me and avoid dropping them into the water. Really,my biggest criticisms are what I explained about the metal support and the adjustable arms. For my tub, one side of it molds into the wall of the house. Therefore, there is probably only three quarters of an inch of the tub wall for the arm to rest on. If there were some kind of rubber or anything that could grip instead of just the bare wood, this would work a little better. So my suggestion would be to check your set up and how this would work in your bathroom. I still think it&#x27;s worthy of four stars because of design is a lot better than the cheap models I see. Clearly, this is built to last for a while. I hope this review helped you make your decision. Check out the photos I&#x27;ve included as well to get a better idea.</li>
    <li> This product did not fit in our bathtub, but we would be proud to re-gift it.</li>
    <li> I received a Bamboo Bathtub Caddy recently and it definitely exceeded my expectations. It scored huge points with me by being ready to use straight out of the box, fitting my tub perfectly, and including a slot for a wine glass. &amp;#60;--Wine and books go together like peas and carrots, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always wanted a product like this, because the only time I choose the tub over the shower is when I want to seriously relax. This caddy makes it easy to do so by holding my phone, book, and drink out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no trouble resting fairly large books on the frame, and the entire caddy seems really sturdy in general. I&#x27;m not afraid to keep my phone on it, so that says a lot. I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for the perfect caddy!</li>
    <li> Very nice!  It is well constructed and arrived very promptly. It pretty much takes care of any need - wine holder, book/tablet, candle, etc. I like the way it slides to accommodate any width.  It&#x27;s a wonderful addition to our clawfoot tub.  Thank you for the excellent service.</li>
    <li> Love the wood and the expansion capabilities of this product. It handles even my large oval bathtub with only minimal bowing in the center (at full expansion.) A secure platform for reading a book or watching video on my Kindle. The only thing I&#x27;d change about it is the wine glass holder. I don&#x27;t drink wine, but a cuppa tea while bathing, so would have found a second indented tray on that side more helpful.  I&#x27;m currently looking for a tea mug shaped like a wine glass.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it, nuf said.</li>
    <li> This caddy fits my wide oval tub. Safely holds a book and stemmed glass. Organic look goes with any style.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery and the product meets our expectations. It is a gift from us to our daughter, who just loves soaking in the tub and reading! now, she can put a glass of water on the same caddy, and there is even space for a phone (she does not have one). The caddy is adjustable, so she can use it both over a wide jacuzzi bath and a narrower, regular tube. It is natural, does not smell chemicals, anything. Thank you!</li>
    <li> perfect for our large deep bathtub.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife for Christmas, and she loves it. Nice and long extendable shelf,  so it fits across the wide soaker tub we have and still feels pretty sturdy.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my daughter as a gift and she loves it that&#x27;s all I can say.</li>
    <li> The wife loves it. Reaches all the way across our jacuzzi tub.</li>
    <li> I have a square shaped hot tub and this  Bath Caddy is wide enough to span it and it looks great.  The book rack is handy and holds an iPad.</li>
    <li> This purchased as a Christmas gift for my wife.  She is thrilled!  Great product very fast delivery.  Thank you very much.  We will certainly use your products in the future.</li>
    <li> The caddy is great!  Just fits my tub, has place for tablet, phone, etc!  Sturdy bamboo; should last for years!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was timely and packaging was excellent.</li>
    <li> I have a wide bathtub and was having a difficult time finding a caddy that extended wide enough.  This one did. Works great, although the wire book prop isn&#x27;t the best. Nice looking, well made, and seems like it will last quite a while.  Very reasonably priced when compared with other bamboo products that are so often overpriced now that bamboo is fashionable. This is a keeper.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the bath junkie!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas.  Her eyes lit up and opened wide when she first unwrapped it.  Mission accomplished!  She loves it!  She loves taking baths and much to my fear she brings her iPhone and iPad with her into the bath.  Gasp!  I know!  It gives me a heart attack just thinking about it.  However, she loves the look of this and the bamboo architecture.  It has functioned well for a month now so I guess I made a good choice, huh?</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use this with bubbles if you want your book to stay dry.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Looks and works fantastically.  Was a gift for my wife and seems to be constructed solidly, holds everything (even stretched out) and looks great.  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Works great for me!  The fact that the wine glass holder does not fit any of my glasses is a downer but other then that I love it!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome item! No more dropping the book in the bathtub! Lol. Great quality and super fast shipping- even at holiday time! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> GF and I both use it. It does the trick. It&#x27;s a bath caddy.</li>
    <li> Got it as a Christmas present for my mother. She absolutely loves it. Shipped quickly, came in excellent quality. Thinking about purchasing one for myself as well!</li>
    <li> More beautiful and sturdy than expected!!!!!  Reallu realy nice!&lt;br /&gt;Your bath looks more inviting and relaxing with this bamboo bathtub caddy.&lt;br /&gt;Its weel built and sturdy.  Don´t hesitate, buy it now!&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived on time.</li>
    <li> For me it is OK but not great and was too expensive for what I got.  The plastic book holder didn&#x27;t work for me.  The book slipped down and didn&#x27;t stay in place.  There was not enough flat space to put things.  The area with slats and the open parts at each end are not useful for me.  I thought for the price I would be getting a great bathtub caddy to replace my plastic one and while I like the bamboo I don&#x27;t like the design.  I&#x27;m using it but I&#x27;m disappointed with my choice.</li>
    <li> I received this complementary to test out and review.  When I opened the package, I found one end to be cracked.  I also never thought about needing two tub sides for this to sit on. My bathtub is flush with the wall on the inside, so I could never use this caddy.  In theory, it seems like it would work and I like how the sides can adjust.  The book prop seems a bit flimsy though.  If you are thinking of ordering, make sure your bathtub has edges on both sides.  As for the broken piece, I&#x27;m not sure that is really the product&#x27;s fault or something in the shipping.</li>
    <li> Fancy yet practical.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I like this much more than my old chrome caddy. No rusting and it matches my bamboo bath accessories I got from The Container Store. The sides slide out to fit your tub and has a special little holder for a glass of wine. My only little complaint is that the wire backrest to hold your book is too big to use for my kindle or iPad mini.  BUT I just put a washcloth in and use the integrated stand in my kindle cover. Works great.</li>
    <li> A Perfect addition to a relaxing bath.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really very convenient - and now I can spend hours in my bath with my tea, a magazine, phone or laptop )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and when I&#x27;m not bathing - I use it as a rack for hand towels)</li>
    <li> It is not that well made and I finally had to throw it away because of the mildew that formed on it.</li>
    <li> A very nice bath caddy. I have used a chrome bath caddy before and did not like it; this one is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It fits my bath, even though one side is against the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book rest is adjustable and fits my iPad just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This product is very well made and attractive.  It has the perfect place for everything.  Would have given 5 stars but sadly I had to return it because the faucet mounting on my free-standing tub did not allow enough room for this.  Unfortunately i have to settle for a much lesser quality one.  Would recommend this one to anyone!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly! Exactly what I was looking for! Great product!</li>
    <li> Very nice product, fast shipping.....</li>
    <li> While I have been looking for something like this for some time, myself as an engineer can see room for some small improvements.  The quality of the woodworking is great, the fit and finish is good, generally overall good.  I really expected something cheaper, this looks nice.  As an engineer, I would and plan to add myself some foam rubber to the bottom of the sides that touch the spa tub, it simply slides around too much.  I have an injured ankle and I use this to hold my tablet computer while I recover in the spa...it would really be a tragedy for someone to drop a tablet or a good book for that matter into the water because the shelf was sliding around so much.  Some nice foam rubber would fix the problem nicely, I hope the manufacturer reads this and takes this idea as an update to the product.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this quite often to play with her ipad in the tub.  The tub is wider than a normal tub which was a concern being she likes her ipad in the tub.  So if she is happy, I am happy. :)</li>
    <li> It definitely completes the look of my bathtub and bathroom.  I have a 32&amp;#34; tub and the caddy adjusts to fit it perfectly.  I now have a place for a bar of soap, my bubble bath and a glass of wine.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace another bathtub caddy I&#x27;d had for years. That one had developed black mold so it had to go, and I was reluctant to buy it again. This one looked like it would fit the bill for my deep, jetted tub that I spend an hour in just about every night. Whether it has a wine glass holder or not wasn&#x27;t important to me (I don&#x27;t drink in the tub) but I really wanted one with a book rack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the position of this one&#x27;s rack renders it useless. As you can see in the photo, the rack sits at the back of the caddy. There is a removable stick that fits into one of three notches, supposedly so you can choose the angle of your book. Well, the rack is so FAR back that the only way to actually see the book, even if you&#x27;ve got it on the most upright position, is by sitting straight up in your tub. I don&#x27;t know about you, but I prefer sinking into my tub, not sitting in it like I&#x27;m in a chair. Maybe that&#x27;s why, even in their own photos, they show the book sitting in front of the stick that&#x27;s supposed to hold your book in place? I tried that, but then my book wouldn&#x27;t stay open so I wound up having to, again, sit up and hold the book open with one hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little more thought to the design could have fixed this. Put the metal book rest in the middle of the rack, not toward the back, or -- better yet -- give users the ability to reposition the metal rack depending on their needs. It&#x27;s a simple change but one that could&#x27;ve made this the caddy I&#x27;d been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it is, I&#x27;ll be replacing this one soon. Not for mold problems -- it hasn&#x27;t developed any -- but because it&#x27;s not an enjoyable addition to my nightly bath.</li>
    <li> I like the way bamboo dries so fast and this always looks good as it cleans well. Has the part to put books on although I don&#x27;t read like that but the function holds your shower puff from falling into the tub.. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this for bathtime and I get lots of compliments!</li>
    <li> Bought it for a gift and she liked it... Sorry I don&#x27;t know any specifics</li>
    <li> Perfect for Bath hour!!!</li>
    <li> slides around on the edge of the tub. no way to secure it.</li>
    <li> I love my bathtub caddy! It held my iPad perfectly.</li>
    <li> Oh how this had possibilities...wide enough for my garden tub, beautiful bamboo construction, a perfectly appointed place for my phone and wine, and then the book back rest...non adjustable!  I want to read in bath and I read on my iPad.  The back rest tilts back so far that in order to see the screen I practically have to be sitting perfectly high and straight backed, not ideal for a relaxing bath.  Sadly I tossed the packaging into the trash before trying this item or it would have gone back.  It&#x27;s a great bath caddy with one major flaw :(. I did find a comb that I can wedge behind the book back rest to bring it forward and that works, but for $40 I shouldn&#x27;t have to &amp;#34;MacGyver&amp;#34; my bath accessories.</li>
    <li> A nice addition to my claw foot shipper bathtub for long relaxing soaks. Not so sure I will bring my iPhone into the bath, but there is a place for it.</li>
    <li> Fits across my garden tub. I&#x27;ve had it a while now and the finish is starting to come off, but I have gotten a lot of  use out of it. Started a job where I am on my  feet all day and so take a soak in the tub nearly every night. I put my tablet in a zip lock and stand it on the tray to watch a movie, my water bottle full of ice water sits on the side (or other beverage!... There is a slide holder for stemware). Will definitely buy again when this one wears out.</li>
    <li> Just received it and put it on the bathtub..I couldn&#x27;t be happier! Looks great! and it&#x27;s sturdy and holds my various products beautifully!</li>
    <li> Good quality, exactly as described. Lovely for my freestanding tub.</li>
    <li> My bathtub is 42 inches across and this fits perfectly. It does just what it&#x27;s supposed to do...securely holds phone, will hold up a book, and a thick wine glass fits perfectly. LOVE this!</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price.  Fits even our large garden tub but collapses neatly to be stored away when not in use.</li>
    <li> good quality.  bottom is slippery as others have stated.  I fixed this by sticking rubber dots (to hold wall pictures in place) and this has worked out great.  The book stand is worthless as paperbacks will fall through it and there is nothing to stop the book from sliding.  So don&#x27;t think about using it.  however it does hold other things and so is fairly useful.</li>
    <li> What makes this caddy special is it has a slot to hold your wine glass, a little nook that is for a boar of soap but can hold your phone perfectly too and a metal book support so you can read your favorite novel while relaxing in the tub.  Another great feature about this caddy is the side arms are adjustable, so it will just about all bathtubs. I use mine with every bath. I love it!</li>
    <li> This tray is one of the best (or maybe worst) things I&#x27;ve ever bought for myself. I never want to get out of the bathtub! With a glass of wine, a book stand, and a little nook where I can light a scented candle, bath time has never been so luxurious. I loved it so much that I bought one for my mom for Christmas1</li>
    <li> Really ties the room together.</li>
    <li> Product was returned. I have a pretty nice bathroom. Modern white with tile and full bath and jacuzzi bathtub. Has a spa like feel with lots of natural light and modern touches (white on white bathroom with warm wood accents). This bath rack looks cheap and flimsy. Spend the money on something a bit nicer.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for! I do about three Dead Sea salt baths each week, and this caddy is perfect for me. I bought this one because it expands out to a width I needed for my extra-wide bathtub. It&#x27;s sturdy enough, and has enough space to place several items. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Nice little luxury to add to your bathing experience.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the package. Very sturdy construction. I could put a paperback book on there and it stood up on the prop just fine. Everyone is right about the wine glass. You have to have one with a thin base for it to fit. I found one in my cabinet but it took several tries. Worth the money if you have a wide garden tub.</li>
    <li> Looks great in our newly remodeled master bath.  Handy book and goblet holders for when you soak in a bubble bath.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it. Reads a book, plays on her phone, and drinks her wine in the bath now. Gives me some freetime to enjoy my evening.</li>
    <li> Despite its flimsy appearance, this is a reasonably sturdy piece. It worked great on our wide tub. I had to add rubber pads to the &amp;#34;legs&amp;#34; to prevent it from skidding around on the tub sides, but other than that, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I am in the process of sending this back to you because when opened on Christmas day, it was broken in two places.  The product itself is very nice and I&#x27;m pleased with it but, I&#x27;m not sure I will re-order from you because I fear it will break again.  It was not for me but a gift for my son-in-law who does not live in the same city as I do which makes it even more complicated to return.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife as a gift and she loves it.  It is well made and sturdy.  It does not bounce around or skid across the tub like the metal ones do.  Can recommend without hesitation.</li>
    <li> I asked her what she thought and she said its great..plenty of room for the iPhone, kindle, even a glass of wine</li>
    <li> I received this tray for review and I was a little worried that it wouldn’t fit my tub. There are so many varieties in sizes of bathtubs but the expandable bamboo arms fit any size bathtub per ToiletTree’s product description. It fits! Once I expanded the tray I was worried that it wouldn’t be sturdy once it expanded. Made from 100% natural eco-friendly bamboo the shelf is definitely sturdy once I expanded it to fit over my large bathtub. It features a book support, built in soap holder, and slide-in glass holder for stemware. I’m an avid reader and I’m loving the book support. If you’re in the market for a bathtub caddy I definitely recommend ToiletTree.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my daugher-in-law and was very pleased with it when it came.  good quality!</li>
    <li> She is already using it and loving it.</li>
    <li> I like the quality of this bathtub caddy.  I have used it to prop up an iPad and a regular book, it does the job well.</li>
    <li> Quality platform for my dear to relax with</li>
    <li> Works great. Phone slot too small for iphone 6.</li>
    <li> Like the product, good for big tubs, but not very well made – within a few weeks and to crazy glue it back to gather.</li>
    <li> Love it. Well made.  Good proportions.  Fits a standard tub and would extend to handle a wider one.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom and she LOVES it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this caddie for the wife for our oversized bathtub jacuzzi. It fits perfect. In addition, the wine glass holder fits all our glasses. She&#x27;s happy. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my wife.  She has told me on more than one occasion that she loved it.  I like making my sife happy.</li>
    <li> Fits great on my oversized tub.  Everything works great i can put ipad on book etc.... wine glass insert is too shallow though.  I just put glass on other side.</li>
    <li> I have a very large claw foot tub and required a caddy that would stretch 41 inches.  This product advertised it would reach across.  I was worried that if I extended it so far it would not be stable.  We unpacked the item, it is sturdy and well built.  Moment of truth, extended it all the way, it reached across was stable and did not sag in the middle. Wine holder is a nice touch.  Book holder is ok, not made for a paperback, but we felt comfortable enough to put the tablet on it and it was fine.  Solid and sturdy product in a nice neutral bamboo finish.  Highly recommend over a metal one.</li>
    <li> I love this. It is perfect for reading or watching a show while soaking. One thing to note, the book/ipad stand is too big if you have a kindle (this is no big deal for me because my kindle case came with a stand) love all the space to set phone, wine, books, etc...</li>
    <li> I love my caddy!  None of the fears materialized that were discussed.  My wine glass fit just fine.  my iPad has it&#x27;s own stand so wasn&#x27;t a concern.  I agree with some of the reviewers statement that a non-slip rubberized cover on the ends of the extensions would be nice but so far no spills have occurred.  Thanks for a great product and quite a few luxurious baths.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife to make her baths more enjoyable, and she loves it! She was so excited when she got it that she climbed into the empty tub fully clothed to try it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ToiletTree Products was a joy to deal with, as well. The package came well-packed, and the bamboo caddy is well-made and is of high quality and aesthetic appeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I very much recommend this!</li>
    <li> I love the quality of the product.  Not flimsy at all.  Worth it for the price as well as the less expensive versions are on the flimsier side.</li>
    <li> The flexibility of the shelf is great. It&#x27;s easy to move and fit to different parts of the tub. It seems sturdy enough for regular use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great. could use some no slip pad&#x27;s where the arm&#x27;s sit on the tubb, but we added those easilly.</li>
    <li> I have an uncommonly shaped bathtub, so I needed something that would stretch to span across the top.  This totally does the trick!  I agree with others, that you might want to put some felt underneath the &#x27;handles&#x27; to keep them from sliding, but this hasn&#x27;t caused any major problems for me.  I found the perfect sized wine glass for it, and my iPad rests comfortably against the metal support, even with the Targus cover still on it.  Now I can relax in the bath, with a glass of wine, a book on my iPad, and my phone playing Pandora within reach if I want to skip a track.  Heaven!!</li>
    <li> This was the best gift I gave this Christmas.  The person receiving it has told me twice how much she loves it.</li>
    <li> I boughts this for my wife as part of her Christmas gift. She LOVES it. It looks great and functions exactly how you would expect it to function.</li>
    <li> Overall an excellent product.  Fits the tub well and it functionality is nearly perfect.  I would suggest two minor changes.  First, the metal part on which you lean your book could have a couple extra &amp;#34;slats&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;bars&amp;#34; for a book or iPad to lean against to prevent it from falling through into the tub.  Second, the fixed part of the tray where you set a book or iPad that is slightly lower than the rest of the tray is just a bit narrow. An iPad or book does not sit even or flat as a result.  Just a bit of minor tweaking.  Thanks! 😃.</li>
    <li> our previous bath caddy was metal and after a while it started leaking rusty water :(&lt;br /&gt;this bamboo one is PERFECT!</li>
    <li> Nice quality, and it is long enough to fit across claw foot tubs.  I would suggest adding rubber to the cutouts to keep it from sliding.</li>
    <li> Within less than a month the finish is coming off.....need I say more</li>
    <li> This was a birthday gift for my daughter.  It was a beautiful piece and she was just ecstatic with it.  I was rather jealous and own&#x27;t be surprised if I end up ordering one for myself!~!</li>
    <li> Just what I expected. Fits perfectly and does not easily slide closed. I feared it would easily slide closed and fall in the water. It den&#x27;s, so I can safely use my iPad while relaxing.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had the chance to use it yet, but it looks nice on my bath tub.  One complaint is the &amp;#34;phone spot&amp;#34; is cut for an older style iPhone, my 5 does not fit inside the cut out.</li>
    <li> The box was a bit rough, it was a gift so I wasn&#x27;t too happy about that, but the product was great. Described accurately.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in timely fashion and meets all expectations.</li>
    <li> Item appears to be well made, works exactly as described and looks good.  I like the book holder, dedicated area for my phone and wine glass!</li>
    <li> I use mine in my regular bathtub. I need to put some foam under the narrow edge of the bathtub close to the wall--so it doesn&#x27;t slide off that little ledge. But no problem really. Nice quality and feel of the product. Does not feel cheap nor flimsy. I like mine a lot!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife. She used it one time and said that it did not work well for her.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use in our jacuzzi tub and I LOVE it!  It truly was far more than I expected.  I can use my IPad and Kindle FireHD on it with ease.  Plus, my drink and my ashtray (I know, no grief please!) fit with ease.  I don&#x27;t have to sit sideways in the jacuzzi anymore to get to the drink or my the &#x27;toys&#x27; anymore.  The first night I sat in the jacuzzi for 3 hours while I read a book on the kindle.  My husband was astonished as I used to normally only spend maybe 30 minutes in the jacuzzi because it was too uncomfortable having everything out of reach.  Well worth the money for this fantastic bathtub caddy!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;No real assembly to speak of, and it easily fit over my standard tub and stays up even though I have very small edges on my tub. The extender works smoothly with little to no effort, but stays put where you set it. The phone caddy is a nice addition, but I am too nervous to consider actually putting my phone there - instead I use it to securely hold face wash, razors, candles, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The wine glass rack/slot is a little thin and my glasses do not fit. I simply put mine on top of the wood instead of inside the slot, but it would&#x27;ve been nice. (I have standard issue 4-pack wine glasses from a superstore in case anyone is wondering) The book holder area is a little too small for my Kindle Fire HD to lay sideways (I believe it&#x27;s the 8&amp;#34; or so size) - Not a big deal, though, as I can lay it vertically instead, but just a little disheartening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;Great product, sturdy and easy to use. Definitely enhances my bath as it gives me a nice little shelf for reading &amp; wine. Some of the &amp;#34;bonus&amp;#34; features don&#x27;t work as they were intended for me, but it still gets the job done quite nicely.</li>
    <li> ...the rectangular &#x27;book&#x27; area is *just* not quite wide enough for my iPad.  Seems like a silly oversight by the manufacturer.  Otherwise, this is great:  looks nice, seems durable, and adaptable to just about any tub.  Unfortunately, I&#x27;m returning it for one I don&#x27;t like the look of as well because it will better accommodate my iPad.</li>
    <li> Love this bathtub caddy.  Received it as a gift and use it often.  However, it cannot be used easily with paperbacks.  It would be nice if the curved edge fit our claw foot tub a little better, but it still works.</li>
    <li> The little wooden stick that was suppose to fit between the steel bookholder didn&#x27;t fit! But other than that, the quality was okay.</li>
    <li> This was a gift of the first order. It adds great convenience to that leisure tub soaking experience. It looks good, and is just the right size to hold a drink, a book, a candle and a magazine. Order yours today and enojy it soon.</li>
    <li> We lived in a home with an 80 gallon Jacuzzi for 23 years .. sorry .. rarely used it!  Then moved into a new condo with a delightful bathtub.  Read MANY reviews for this type of bath tray.  Decided on this one.  Received it .. told myself that when I had totally gotten us unpacked in our new condo I would treat myself to a wonderful bubble bath with newly purchased lavender bubble bath, lavender candle light, soft music, my BAMBOO CADDY with a glass of wine/hors de oeuvres/my Kindle enclosed in a plastic bag per previous reviews, the wonderful best reviewed backrest propping me up .. hmmmm heaven to goad me forward each day toward that mountain of boxes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally one week end my husband was gone .. hmmm .. 7 boxes yet to be unpacked .. BUT none of them in sight of the master bath!  On went the water .. in went the lavender bubble bath .. lit was the lavender candle .. off went the bright lights .. on went the soft music .. on went my lovely bamboo tray .. BUT .. I realized that what I really desired in my newly purchased HUGE sensible plastic wine glass .. WAS ice water for the hot steamy water .. AND that piece of yummy pie in the refrigerator!  My perfect doesn&#x27;t have to be anyone else&#x27;s perfect! Ice water and yummy pie .. clothes flying off .. Kindle turned on .. perfection!  What more could I ask of life .. LOVE my new BAMBOO CADDY!</li>
    <li> I love this caddy.  It works perfectly and I especially like that it&#x27;s made of wood.  No rust!</li>
    <li> Unbelievable quality for the price. I am very happy with this item.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife during her bath time while she uses her ipad mini. The only thing is the ipad mini doesn&#x27;t quite fit right so you have to get something to go behind it. Either way its working they way it should and it extends out</li>
    <li> Great Product, my Wife loved it. It almost didn&#x27;t fit over the Jacuzzi Tub, but this is not their fault as we have a very large tub. It seems to be made out of high quality materials and is well put together. So far no problems with it.</li>
    <li> I bought one for myself and loved it so much I got one for my daughter as a gift. Great product.</li>
    <li> It does not include the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; bamboo bar as pictured and described.  My book kept sliding so it&#x27;s going back.</li>
    <li> Love this!  Fits my tub great, I appreciate the way it is sizeable.  Very sturdy adn hold a wine glass great.</li>
    <li> I bought the Bamboo  Bathtub Caddy for a home  I was staging for a local Tour of Homes. This caddy is really beautiful. It fits the wide soaking tub we had put in the home, too. This was my biggest concern but it fits great and has room to expand more if needed. I have had dozens of people ask me where I found it because they love how great it looks.</li>
    <li> Greatness &amp; nice wood</li>
    <li> Purchased this for a friend and she loved it!!! Product was suppose to arrive late evening and arrived in the afternoon! Very happy customer!!</li>
    <li> Came missing the piece that holds your books upright.</li>
    <li> fell into the bath water the first time I used it, along with my book&lt;br /&gt;too big, bulky, heavy</li>
    <li> Great product at an awesome price!  Very solid and looks beautiful!  I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> It is just as described. I love it!</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly on my large tub.  Exactly what i wanted.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this. She now spends hours in the bath reading.</li>
    <li> WHAT OTHER B-WORDS COULD YOU POSSIBLY NEED? #LivingMyBestLife</li>
    <li> This is awesome for being productive while I soak in Epsom salt for body recovery.  It holds a lot and goes pretty wide.</li>
    <li> Good sturdy product. In fact, the best of its kind I&#x27;ve seen. Except that in a standard tub, it seriously gets in the way for long-legged people. So, if you&#x27;re over 5&#x27;7&amp;#34;, you might consider another option (like maybe a fold-up shelf that sits ABOVE the tub).</li>
    <li> Purchased for the wife...arrived quickly and exactly as advertised. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love it ! The slot for my wine glass is too narrow. Perhaps I just need a wine glass with a thinner base. Other than that, I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> the unit was very well designed. Good build quality. My girlfriend has used it many times since I bought it and has been very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift,  and the person loves it !!! It fit  the tub great. I might treat myself soon :)</li>
    <li> With a garden tub (super wide) in the master bathroom, getting a solid bathtub caddy has been a challenge. This one is more than wide enough and is very sturdy. The bamboo has a very nice finish. This is exactly what I wanted and suits my needs perfectly.</li>
    <li> perfect for our large tub...makes tub bathing /soaking with a good book a pleasure again...great quality...highly recommend this product...just love it!</li>
    <li> Good product, good price, on time.</li>
    <li> Item was shipped and delivered very fast, and before the Christmas holiday. The item was in perfect working condition and was exactly as it had been described. I had no issues to speak of and I was very pleased with everything</li>
    <li> I bought this item as a gift and it was well received. The bamboo wood is better around the water than I expected, it is sturdy, does not absorb moisture, and is easy to wipe off. It fits in our tub snugly but perfect in the fully retracted position. My wife is very happy with it and I am glad I got it.</li>
    <li> Bath caddy is good quality and would fit any bath tub. Only complaint is the book holder doesn&#x27;t hold all books very well.</li>
    <li> Quote from wife, &amp;#34;Excellent. Fits various sizes of tubs. I have no complaints at all.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Brought this for my wife and she loves it.  It&#x27;s solid and is able to fit her iPhone 6 perfectly in the compartment it provides.  This is definitely something I would buy again and would tell people about.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. She is a bath taker, so this was the perfect gift for her.</li>
