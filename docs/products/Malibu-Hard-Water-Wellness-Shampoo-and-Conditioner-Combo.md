      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Works excellent and Amazon gave me a great savings of almost 50%.</li>
      <li>Pleasant smell.  </li>
      <li>The product works good, I use it in conjunction with the weekly hair treatments though.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m please with it and will be purchasing more.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo lathers up great, the conditioner not so much, but maybe that&#x27;s how it works.</li>
      <li>My hair is softer, shiny, and the color is looking better.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>Worked okay; but won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
      <li>Its only saving grace is that it smells wonderful, like a orange cream popsicle.</li>
      <li>but if I use this it stays the right color!!</li>
      <li>The bottles are huge too.</li>
      <li>I can see a huge difference after I use the once weekly treatment.</li>
      <li>But overall its s great shampoo.</li>
      <li>The conditioner doesn&#x27;t make your hair smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>Upon the VERY FIRST use, I could tell a HUGE difference.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately, it is good shampoo, smells good, does wonders for my hair and has been the only thing that has helped in retaining my color and highlights from one salon visit to the next.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipper, I love the product.</li>
      <li>I am on the second day of this shampoo and conditioner and I absolutely love it!</li>

      <li>I actually can brush my hair now and its nice and soft!</li>
      <li>We do not have soft water, and this shampoo and conditioner has made my hair so silky clean and shiny.  </li>
      <li>Really made a difference  - the blonde highlights showed better and the hair seemed thicker.  </li>
      <li>:) Shipping on product was higher than expected.</li>
      <li>Shipping was very timely</li>
      <li>My hair went from gummy and brittle back to soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>I use this product as our well is high in iron and minerals.</li>
      <li>If you have blonde processed hair and have iron in your well water or soft water, this is the product for you.  </li>

<li> If you have blonde processed hair and have iron in your well water or soft water, this is the product for you.  </li>
<li> I do use it exclusively when washing my hair with well water and will continue to do that as long as my hair is exposed to that water.</li>
<li> I noticed that when I use this product a couple of times a week after going to the salon and having the hard water tint removed from my hair, that it maintains my normal hair color</li>
<li> I usually only need to wash my hair every few days, with this shampoo my hair appears greasy the day after washing.</li>
<li> I live in Texas and have very hard water.</li>
<li> Other than that it does nothing to improve the quality of my hair.</li>
<li> Hard water Wellness shampoo &amp; conditioner help to keep my blonde hair from turning orange</li>
<li> Before I used this product my hair was dull, brittle, and my blonde was turning brassy and orange!!</li>
<li> I still use my other shampoo on occasion as my hair gets a little too fluffy with Malibu.</li>
<li> Hair, skin and nails are not used to the harsh chemicals used in city water.  </li>
<li> Not sure how well it would work alone.</li>
<li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money on this product!</li>
<li> However, if I fail to use it a couple of times a week, and the hard water starts tinting my hair red</li>
<li> We have hard water.  </li>
<li> I have really hard water</li>
<li> Because we have well water, I have been forced to use this shampoo.  </li>
<li> I would recommend this shampoo and conditioner to anyone that has very hard water.</li>
<li> I have very hard water that turns my hair copper</li>
<li> I am really not happy with this product.</li>
<li> If anything it made my hair worse.</li>
<li> Expensive in my book but work on detangling hair,and getting the orange out of hair from iron well water.</li>
<li> This product was awful!</li>

    <li> Awesome product! Works wonders on my hair! The bottles are huge too. Definitely will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Fast shipper, I love the product. I have very hard water that turns my hair copper but if I use this it stays the right color!!</li>
    <li> This product was awful! If anything it made my hair worse. I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money on this product!</li>
    <li> We have hard water.  I noticed that when I use this product a couple of times a week after going to the salon and having the hard water tint removed from my hair, that it maintains my normal hair color - my hair does not turn red.  However, if I fail to use it a couple of times a week, and the hard water starts tinting my hair red then this product does not remove the red from my hair.</li>
    <li> I live in Texas and have very hard water. Before I used this product my hair was dull, brittle, and my blonde was turning brassy and orange!! I have tried dozens of different products to help and nothing had worked until this came along my way. I am on the second day of this shampoo and conditioner and I absolutely love it! My hair is softer, shiny, and the color is looking better. I would recommend this shampoo and conditioner to anyone that has very hard water.</li>
    <li> I use this product as our well is high in iron and minerals. Hard water Wellness shampoo &amp; conditioner help to keep my blonde hair from turning orange :) Shipping on product was higher than expected.</li>
    <li> Worked okay; but won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> The conditioner doesn&#x27;t make your hair smooth and silky. But overall its s great shampoo.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery!  Great product!</li>
    <li> Because we have well water, I have been forced to use this shampoo.  Fortunately, it is good shampoo, smells good, does wonders for my hair and has been the only thing that has helped in retaining my color and highlights from one salon visit to the next.  This shampoo has helped me NOT have to have Malibu treatments done to my hair at every visit.  I do use it exclusively when washing my hair with well water and will continue to do that as long as my hair is exposed to that water.</li>
    <li> Really made a difference  - the blonde highlights showed better and the hair seemed thicker.  I still use my other shampoo on occasion as my hair gets a little too fluffy with Malibu.</li>
    <li> I have really hard water and I am thankful for this Shampoo. I actually can brush my hair now and its nice and soft!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Totally changed my hair after one use!! My hair went from gummy and brittle back to soft and healthy. You have to try it if you have a well!!</li>
    <li> I am really not happy with this product. Its only saving grace is that it smells wonderful, like a orange cream popsicle. Other than that it does nothing to improve the quality of my hair. I usually only need to wash my hair every few days, with this shampoo my hair appears greasy the day after washing. The conditioner is almost&lt;br /&gt;worthless, it does not help at all with tangles and does not seem to add any moisture. Will never buy anything from Malibu again.</li>
    <li> Moved into an apartment about 6 months ago and went from well water to city water.  Hair, skin and nails are not used to the harsh chemicals used in city water.  Tried this shampoo/conditioner.  Upon the VERY FIRST use, I could tell a HUGE difference.  Just after shampooing, my hair felt like I had already run conditioner through it.  Pleasant smell.  Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> You always face the risk that it could be a different product inside the bottles. There was tape wrapped around the tops to avoid leakage, but I would suggest some shrink wrap or something. Product works fine for me and my well water!</li>
    <li> Great product! Shipping was very timely</li>
    <li> The product works good, I use it in conjunction with the weekly hair treatments though. Not sure how well it would work alone. The shampoo lathers up great, the conditioner not so much, but maybe that&#x27;s how it works. I&#x27;m please with it and will be purchasing more.  I can see a huge difference after I use the once weekly treatment.</li>
    <li> We do not have soft water, and this shampoo and conditioner has made my hair so silky clean and shiny.  I absolutely love this product.</li>
    <li> If you have blonde processed hair and have iron in your well water or soft water, this is the product for you.  My colorist told me at the time of my touch ups, she could tell that I needed this product for her coloring to work correctly.  Since then, I use the shampoo and conditioner.  Works excellent and Amazon gave me a great savings of almost 50%.</li>
    <li> Great product for hard water.</li>
    <li> Expensive in my book but work on detangling hair,and getting the orange out of hair from iron well water.</li>
