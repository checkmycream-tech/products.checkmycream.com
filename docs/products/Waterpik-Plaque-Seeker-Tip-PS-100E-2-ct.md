<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like these a lot but the bristles break down fairly quickly</li>
    <li> I bought the Waterpik Plaque Seeker as replacement tips to have for Waterpik.  These tips are great for use around bridges and crowns.</li>
    <li> I ordered these because the one that came with my Waterpik became unusable (the hairs spread all over the place); the same happened with these after a while. I don&#x27;t think they are poor quality, but that this will simply happen with use; that is why I wouldn&#x27;t rate them low.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well and I thought I should get a few extra in case the ones that came with the Waterpik wore out. Also who wants to share their  tooth brush even if it is with their wife.</li>
    <li> I had one that came with the waterpik and really liked it.  The bristles were showing wear, so I ordered 2 via Amazon and quite pleased.  Would highly recommend. The bristles help keep one from getting the head too close and I feel that I can do a more thorough job with the type tip.  Highly recommend these tips.</li>
    <li> Good product only too bad the price is too high or I would order more often thank you for asking</li>
    <li> I have ordered this item before and they work well with the Waterpik unit and are a necessity.&lt;br /&gt;Each attachment lasts for approximately six months, so it&#x27;s great that you receive two with each order.</li>
    <li> The Waterpil Plaque Seeker is a nice product, keeps the teeth and mouth fresh and clean but be ware not to use it at the sink as you will get wet best to use it in the shower.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t get in the routine of flossing, but with the pressure of the Water&#x3D;Pik and the bristles, I get my teeth almost as clean as flossing.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik replacement tips I ordered our saving my gums and teeth.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is having teeth and gum problems.</li>
    <li> These are good but will clog up at small exit hole</li>
    <li> Great value for the money. We love our waterpik</li>
    <li> I really did not like the Waterpik. I assume if you like the Waterpik you will like these. Hard to judge these if you do not like the product they go on.</li>
    <li> I have used Waterpik products before and the Plaque Seeker works fantastic. It really gets between the teeth and between the tooth and gums.</li>
    <li> I have my share of dental crowns, and this tip really helps me to keep their cleaning easy.  Love the idea.</li>
    <li> It is what it says it is.</li>
    <li> This is the tip to use with your water flosser.  Better than the jet tip, because it&#x27;s a little less susceptible to blowing plaque up under your gums and causing problems.  Still need to use with care, but it works well when you do.</li>
    <li> Works well!  Does what it says it will do. The cost should be less though or send a pack of 3. I am however glad that I can buy extra tips as I need them.</li>
    <li> AS ADVERTISED, FAIRLY GOOD PRICE WORKS WELL IN WATERPIK.</li>
    <li> work great, would buy them again</li>
    <li> I have been using Waterpik toothbrush and water floss for six months now. This product has taken that clean feeling after oral hygiene to a new level. Happiest moment during flossing is when I see food debris dropping on the sink. My dentist approves.</li>
    <li> Great job of removing plaque</li>
    <li> Purchased as replacement tips.  &#x27;same quality as the originals, could not be happier.</li>
    <li> shipped quickly and have order this product multiple times great item</li>
    <li> It fulfills the function it was created for which is all I expect.</li>
    <li> This is my second order as these tips are perfect for smoothies filled with chopped nuts and seeds, especially the evasive Chia seeds.&lt;br /&gt;I have not seen any build up of plaque in my close up mirror in the one spot that plaque clings to. I will have a professional check in October as I have great teeth (never any cavities), but a higher calcium or plaque formation. I, therefore go every 4 months for cleaning.</li>
    <li> I still have trouble figuring out how to replace this product, but having grandsons in the house, that problem is solved.  Being interested in &amp;#34;germ warfare&amp;#34;, I like the ability to replace this important part of the waterpik.</li>
    <li> The dentist always wanted to charge me extra for cleaning my teeth. Since using this and the pocket pic tip, they no longer say I have gum disease</li>
    <li> Works fine with my machine</li>
    <li> Good value for replacement tips &amp; love that they are different colors. We LOVE our waterpik!!!  Worth the investment....my gums are healthier than they&#x27;ve been in years.</li>
    <li> Great attachment for the Waterpik. Will order again. Make sure you buy your Waterpik and see instructions for which attachment is right for you and your situation(gum disease, braces etc) before ordering attachments.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I would highly suggest buying it to keep your teeth and gums healthy and clean.</li>
    <li> These tips for my Waterpic Ultra water flosser make removing plaque a breeze with no effort on my part.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot less plaque and tartar build up on my teeth since I began using these tips.  I just wish they came with more in the package.  My hygienist has noticed the difference.</li>
    <li> Looks great but was wrong product. Searched for WP-60 replacement picks and these came up but didn&#x27;t fit at all.</li>
    <li> Works great with two different waterpiks that I have.</li>
    <li> These were replacement tips for our existing Water-Pik.  Hard to find, but they do a great job of CLEANING TEETH WITH BRACES!&lt;br /&gt;Very effective tool!  A specialized use, but a superior solution.</li>
    <li> My kids loved these, the cleanest floss for the laziest people :)</li>
    <li> I received within a few days of ordering.  I use the Waterpik daily and these are great replacement tips.  Works very well.</li>
    <li> Just had braces put on for the second time, ugh! These heads are really helful in keeping my braces clean and flushing out extra food that tends to get trapped! I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the picks.</li>
    <li> These really help cleaning dental implants!</li>
    <li> I purchased the replacement tips for the new Waterpik Flosser we recently purchased. The tips arrived within a few days after placing the order in excellent condition. I will purchase from this seller again in the future.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s  really  a  great product  for clean your  mout  .... I recommend it to everyone for a good health ...</li>
    <li> Terrific item, especially for those of us with periodontal disease.</li>
    <li> Great for people with braces.</li>
    <li> Work great at removing plaque!</li>
    <li> Used all time every day with implants maintenance......great water pik accessory.</li>
    <li> These were hard to find so am very happy.</li>
    <li> I accidentally broke the tip off. What I was not aware of (and despite the package itself saying that the pic only fits the WP-450 and NOT the WP-450W) I struggled to install the new water pic I replaced the broken one with.  WHat I was not aware of at the time was that you need to dig out the remains of the old pic which goes well past the colored ring at the base of it, so I concluded that the one I ordered to replace the broken one was the wrong one and would not fit my Water Flosser.  AFter a lot of trying to push the new pick into the hole and after a great deal of thought, I got a hold of a very thin screw driver and reached deeply into the hole and dug the rest of the water pick out of the top of the Flosser. Subsequently, the replacement picks (although STILL mis-labelled) did indeed work. SO I cancelled my return request, which AMAZON was more than happy to do, and I am now keeping the replacements.&lt;br /&gt;The WP-450 DOES INDEED fit the WP-450W in case anyone cares.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted fits perfectly!</li>
    <li> Wonderful, have used water pic for ever, but this new one is great.</li>
    <li> This is a must for any kind of water pik. The results are well worth the money. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> the waterpik items i ordered which are very small were delivered in a package that could have held the declaration of independence,gross overkill.</li>
    <li> It is a waterpik, what else is there to say? Here is where I babble until the little submit button pops on. Oh look, there it is.....</li>
    <li> I made a wrog order, Its not work in oral B kits&lt;br /&gt;sorry</li>
    <li> These tips don&#x27;t seem to concentrate the water flow as well as the Jet tips do, so I stopped using them in favor of the Jet tip.</li>
    <li> My husband has the waterpik, but it came with only 1 set of the 4 tips. I liked the plaque seeker tip, so I purchased the replacement tips so we could share the waterpik. It does a great job. Very easy to switch out the tips.</li>
    <li> These &amp;#34;flosser&amp;#34; tips are not really that great, they are rather harsh against your gums; I know that they need to be stiff enough to get between your teeth but they can be round tipped so that they are gentler on your gums, etc.</li>
    <li> Again, this is a first experience with Waterpik.  I opted for the extra tip as I wasn&#x27;t sure how this tip compared with the ones that came with the Unit.  This tip is included the unit, you do not need to purchase this one unless you need extras.  I didn&#x27;t absorb the &amp;#34;What&#x27;s in box&amp;#34; info.  The bristles seemed to &amp;#34;sweep&amp;#34; just under the gum line on those teeth that was easily visible and accessible, that&#x27;s a good thing.  No cons</li>
    <li> I find the Water Pik water flosser with the tiny brushes to do a great job.  I have 4 dental bridges and cleaning around and ABOVE the bridge is an area I have neglected.  Now it is amazing how much I can flush out after a regular tooth brushing. I can&#x27;t wait to see what my dentist says!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love things but this device has been very helpful</li>
    <li> Love the WaterPik and was so happy to find the replacement  tips at a reasonable price.  I WILL purchase again!</li>
    <li> Thanks for making available replacement attachments for the handheld Waterpik.  Thanks also for making so many items available on one site.</li>
    <li> Good product and price</li>
    <li> Good for spare parts.</li>
    <li> these tips will help remove practically all embedded debris from around your teeth and gums.  i use the water pic before i regularly brush. you wil be amazed on how much food particles get removed from your teeth and gum area throughout the course of a day! this set of replacement tips are highly recommended to ensure proper cleaning and to make your water pik work th most efficiently.</li>
    <li> First of all, I love my Waterpik that I bought on Amazon. I have a permanent lingual bonded retainer behind my top set of teeth to keep my teeth from shifting after having braces, and so food inevitably get&#x27;s stuck and I can&#x27;t use traditional string floss. But my these Plaque seekers are designed for just that purpose, for people with hardware in their mouths. They really get in there and clean house! So even if you don&#x27;t have anything on you&#x27;re teeth these will work for you so stop using that terrible string and move into the 21st century and get a Waterpik with the plaque seeker tips (which by the way, one comes with a flosser).</li>
    <li> My son has braces, so I got him a Waterpik. A variety of tips came with it but the one I liked the best was the &amp;#34;plaque seeker&amp;#34;. It really get around his braces and cleans up great. This purchase was for a refill.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really excited to use these plaque seeker with our waterpik. I love how versatile the Waterpik is with all the different attachments for all your teeth cleaning needs. :-)</li>
    <li> This tip is the one that I tell all of my dental patients to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Watepic for about 2 years now and not one cavity found. I love this tip the best. It gets to everything and leaves your teeth feeling nice and clean.</li>
    <li> looks good, haven&#x27;t try yet</li>
    <li> Happy to have replacement tips for my waterpik.  This works very well.  I like to be able to get in between the teeth and these do a super job.  They are comfortable in the mouth.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what we were looking for and does not seem to be available in the store</li>
    <li> Teeth and gums are happier now</li>
    <li> Works great with the waterpik flosser.</li>
    <li> these help get the plaque....</li>
    <li> Hard to find locally so thank you.  They fit my system perfectly and are already in use hopefully there will be more.</li>
    <li> This product was not what I thought. Couldn&#x27;t tell from picture that it had the little bristles so I ended up reordering the correct ones.</li>
    <li> These things are a life saver.  The little bristles make a huge difference.  Great with braces and will continue to use when they come off.  Of the 6 different tips, these are the only ones used.  Bristles last about 10 months.  Good quality, will be buying again.</li>
    <li> These tips work very well.  We feel nice and clean after using them!  They come with different color parts to tell our tips apart from each other.</li>
    <li> I use it to clean my daughters&#x27; teeth/gum. Even after manually floss, this pik can still find remains of food crumbs between teeth and flush them out.</li>
    <li> Great solution for cleaning my teeth</li>
    <li> Eliminated my deep cleaning.  Use every night and it really works.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best part of the Water Pik for me.  I was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get just the Plaque Seeker alone but lo &amp; behold, there it was!  And at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> These are just like the originals and work great; especially on my son&#x27;s braces.  The price was okay too.  I recommend these heads.</li>
    <li> Useful to have a second one of these so that both my wife and I can have our own. I wish I could have just bought a single item to supplement the one that came with the Flosser originally.</li>
    <li> These are specialty tips for the Water Pik that allow you to do more than just floss. I got the entire set and am using them.</li>
    <li> These little flossers are great, no need to floss everyday, these babies will dislodge most anything that get stuck in your teeth.  Again you need to disinfect them otherwise they will start to smell like what you ate last week.  I dip mine in a water alcohol solution and air dry.  Though you are supposed to order new ones every 3 to 6 months.</li>
    <li> The bristles help guide the tip very nicely. very good for implants.</li>
    <li> They work as designed. One wonders if they need to be this expensive but I assume you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, these are the most appropriate picks for the  water pick. They work the best for me...</li>
    <li> Make sure you have the correct model - the product may be good but I cannot test it - again check your model</li>
    <li> This was exactly was my wife wanted.  These items arrived ahead of schedule.  I am sure they will give the service needed for the water pik.</li>
    <li> Broke original. Needed to replace.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite of the Waterpik tips.  The spaces between my teeth is tight and, with this tip, I am able to get my teeth cleaner than with floss - and without the annoyance of the floss being stuck between my teeth.My dentist is very pleased at the improvement.</li>
    <li> I have braces on my teeth and purchased the Water Pic Flosser to help me keep everything clean as possible. I love this little tool. It gets in between my braces and does an exceptional job.</li>
    <li> Works well with my daughter&#x27;s braces!</li>
    <li> When I am in a hurry I use these tips in place of flossing and it works perfectly.  I have had these before and so am just replacing the ones I had.  Last dental appointment resulted in what seemed to me to be a bit less plaque.  I build lots of plaque in between cleanings at the Dentist, so anything I can do to reduce the plaque buildup helps.  This tool seems to do the trick.  Would certainly recommend</li>
    <li> Have purchased from the seller several times and never have had a problem with the product or the seller.  I would recommend this to anyone that is in need of replacement tips.</li>
    <li> Got these for me, I love the waterpik and all accessories. I always want to buy extras of those tools I use all the time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not really the ones that I was looking for but they work ok.  There are little bristles on them that might help get some food off teeth but the stream is not as strong as the originals that come with the waterpik.</li>
    <li> Quality is good and very fast shipping. My usage experience is great too</li>
    <li> This work well in conjunction with the pik pocket.  I like to use the plague seeker first to help clean the area were the tooth meets the gum.</li>
    <li> Love it. Had best dental checkup in years</li>
    <li> Delivered earlier than promised and exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> Initial use is quite satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FBManalo</li>
    <li> They work great, and more importantly, my dentist is happy.</li>
    <li> Purchased as an extra set for my WaterPik so that both of us in our household could use the product.</li>
    <li> Great device. It really adds pressure to clean between the teeth much better than flossing  I  definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> use these all the time.</li>
