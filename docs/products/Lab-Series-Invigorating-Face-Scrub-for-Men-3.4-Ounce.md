      <li>I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;(But</li>
      <li>and I love the way my face</li>
      <li>Leaves skin feeling nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>this is the most aggressive face scrub I have been able to find</li>
      <li>Have been using them for many years.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;just protecting skin not getting better..</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel very clean and hydrated</li>
      <li>It is mild and easy on his skin!</li>
      <li>which is a huge plus.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but really just foams up nicely.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave a clean, refreshed feeling like the menscience microscrub does.</li>
      <li>Not as soapy as I expected it to be but still a great product.</li>

      <li>I have used many different premium brands of face scrub from Jack Black to Clinique for men.</li>
      <li>It will instantly clear up your skin after one use.</li>
      <li>I had been using St. Ives Apricot Scrub for about 7 years and while it helped me with breakouts in my early to mid-twenties</li>
      <li>You can use the generic store brands but you really get what you pay for when it comes to these types of products.</li>
      <li>No trouble or issues.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t need the salicylic acid in there anymore or the abrasive stuff that left my skin feeling dry and over-scoured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are definitely worth the little extra money.</li>

    <li> LAB series is Always perfect to me!! I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;(But also price is always little expensive...)&lt;br /&gt;anyway, thx for good item.</li>
    <li> using this lotion for my skin&lt;br /&gt;and it feels like...&lt;br /&gt;just protecting skin not getting better..&lt;br /&gt;that&#x27;s all&lt;br /&gt;wth ?</li>
    <li> I have to say this is the best face product I have ever used. I had been using St. Ives Apricot Scrub for about 7 years and while it helped me with breakouts in my early to mid-twenties I really didn&#x27;t need the salicylic acid in there anymore or the abrasive stuff that left my skin feeling dry and over-scoured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So i started using this scrub, which has a little bit of grit but really just foams up nicely. It makes my skin feel very clean and hydrated which is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did also buy the Lab Series multi-action face wash to use twice a week as an exfoliate but I don&#x27;t really need it. I just use the Invigorating scrub twice daily when I shower and I love the way my face feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never saw myself as a person who would spend $18+ on a facewash but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this for over a week now and there is a DRAMATIC difference in his skin. No more breakouts! He used to have them scattered about,&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to find a blackhead.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for at least 10 years. It works miracles. It will instantly clear up your skin after one use. I normally have oily skin and will get zits if I go off my normal regimen for a few days, but this scrub cleans off my face and makes it look bright again. It tingles a little, but that&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> Not very abrasive and feels like it&#x27;s leaving a slight residue. Not bad but just not a great scrub. Doesn&#x27;t leave a clean, refreshed feeling like the menscience microscrub does.</li>
    <li> This stuff works so well I stole it from my husband!</li>
    <li> I have been using Lab series shaving products for years. I recently started applying the face scrub while in the shower (juts makes it easier to rinse off.) I still use the Electric Shave Solution (a pre-shave alcohol liquid) before finally shaving with my electric shaver. The Electric Shave Solution by itself always gave my a closer shave. What I am noticing with the face scrub is that I can now go an extra day or two between shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the gritty feel of this product. It washes off easily and I have not noticed a residue left behind as experienced by other reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really see a change in my skin, but I also don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what this product is intended for. They have other products to clear up your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this scrub. Yes, it&#x27;s a little pricey for something that&#x27;s really just a slight perk, but I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
    <li> Seems to be in order. No trouble or issues. After all, what more can you expect from online shopping.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and will continue using for years.  It was a better price than I had been paying at malls in the area.</li>
    <li> Not as soapy as I expected it to be but still a great product. Will definitely buy it again and I feel its better than their other face washes!</li>
    <li> Great scrub, have purchased multiple times before, highly recommend and would definitely purchase again.It makes my skin look cleaner and fresh.</li>
    <li> Good quality, shipping very fast!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years- abrasive enough (without being too harsh, if used properly) that you actually feel it working, unlike the $6-7 face scrubs that you can buy at the supermarket. Leaves skin feeling nice and smooth. Pretty good value if you use a relatively small amount at a time and don&#x27;t use it every single day- one order lasts me probably six weeks or so.</li>
    <li> I have tryed others before. It works really well and gives a sensation of cleanliness after using it without feeling your skin broke.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my husband along with the shave cream...he loves it and it is the only scrub that he will use!  It is mild and easy on his skin!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent if  tend toward having an oily face. And if there any acne areas it tends to resolve  very nicely.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! I have been using this for years and will continue to use it for the foreseeable future.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of this men&#x27;s product line.  A little pricey but the products live up to their claims.  Have been using them for many years.  They are definitely worth the little extra money.</li>
    <li> this is the most aggressive face scrub I have been able to find</li>
    <li> I have used many different premium brands of face scrub from Jack Black to Clinique for men. This is every bit as good and priced better than either of those. I really like that it doesn&#x27;t take a lot and rinses clean. You can use the generic store brands but you really get what you pay for when it comes to these types of products.</li>
