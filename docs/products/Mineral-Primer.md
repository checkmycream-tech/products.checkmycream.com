      <li>this is a nice product.</li>

      <li>Great primer made of minerals and natural materials</li>
      <li>, it has a nice feel when I apply it, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price I paid for.  </li>
      <li>This product feels so luxurious, it really feels like you are taking good care of yourself when you use it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s silky, goes on easily, BUT...</li>
      <li>The pump is nice, and delivers a consistent amount of product.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t break me out, I don&#x27;t get shiny, makeup goes on smooth and stays put.</li>

      <li>Fantastic product.  </li>

      <li>The primer&#x27;s silky formula applies on smooth and helps minimize my large pores and fine lines.</li>
      <li>arrived quickly, just as described</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many primers but this one is my favourite by far!</li>
      <li>My favorite primer by far!</li>
      <li>In fact, my skin is abnormally calm after wearing this under my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really like how it glides on my skin and is so silky smooth.  </li>
      <li>It transforms your skin into a smooth surface area ready for your makeup..</li>
      <li>The nice thing about this packaging is that as the product is pumped out, the bottom of the bottle actually moves up, so the rest of the product is pushed up to where the pump can suck it out.</li>
      <li>I have skin that easily breaks out with products (reason why I had to find a new primer) and this product did not break me out.</li>
      <li>this keeps foundation from looking cakey and really helps for a more natural look.</li>
      <li>This product provides a light silicone barrier between your skin and foundation such that your foundation floats smoothly.  </li>
      <li>Thank you very much.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this primer</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love, love, love this product.</li>
    <li> This primer is amazing.  It&#x27;s in a gel form and you only need one pum to cover the entire face.  It&#x27;s very silky and make up applies very well after.  It holds the make up in place the whole day.  I never have to reapply powder during the day!!  I would recommend this product to all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many primers but this one is my favourite by far! Gives the mineral foundation a flawless base to work on and also helps keep it on all day.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!!  My favorite Primer.  It goes on smoothly and lasts all day!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this primer for a couple of years.  During that time, I&#x27;ve tried other primers that received top reviews and I always go back to this one.  This is by far the very best primer out there.  Not only does it create a \\&quot;silky finish\\&quot; for applying makeup, it reduces the appearance of my fine lines.  I&#x27;ll be using this forever.</li>
    <li> Great primer, and gives skin a smooth finish.  You don&#x27;t have to use much to make your make-up look fresh all day.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Makes foundation go on smoothly and it feels good on your skin.  Have tried other primers and I always come back to youngblood.</li>
    <li> This is the smoothest primer I have ever used!  I really like how it glides on my skin and is so silky smooth.  Yes I have already recommended it to others.</li>
    <li> So far I really like this primer. I was using Urban Decay which is fine but I think this works better. Nothing I have used actually makes the makeup stay on all day but I feel like this makes for a nice surface on which to apply foundation. I recommend letting your moisturizer sink in for a few minutes before applying this and I recommend letting this product set for a couple minutes before applying foundation.</li>
    <li> I would not dream of applying foundation without it. It smooths my skin like velvet and gives more youthful appearance.</li>
    <li> You need such a small amount!  Believe me, I have tried them all.  This works in the arid dry of the &amp;#34;below sea-level&amp;#34; deserts in California, and in the humid &amp;#34;Ocean breezes&amp;#34; of the coastal foggy days and nights.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Great primer made of minerals and natural materials</li>
    <li> It does everything it says it will do.  Smooth on after moisturizer and before concealer, bronzer, foundation, etc.  It is a silky layer that just makes you feel good putting it on.</li>
    <li> I bought this with their liquid mineral faoundation (shell), and again, I have no idea whay the hype is about. Feels like a silicone layer on top of my face.</li>
    <li> The primer is my favorite make-up accessory. It is excellent! It is the best primer that I have ever used. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I cannot be without this product.  It is too expensive but I still cannot do without it.  I use the Youngblood Mineral Primer with Aminogenesis Facial Repair.  They are good to use together.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong - this is a nice product. It&#x27;s silky, goes on easily, BUT... This is the same product as bareMinerals Prime Time for almost double the price.  And it lasts half to 3/4 as long.</li>
    <li> This primer makes my 48 year old skin feel so soft and smooth. My makeup lasts all day now and since I switched from the cheap drugstore stuff I have been getting compliments on how good I look .</li>
    <li> Best primer ever, a little goes along the way and offer great protection and keep makeup in place. It is odorless and not irritating at all. I have acne prone skin and work flawless.</li>
    <li> Love the light feel and the coverage! Perfect primer.</li>
    <li> This primer isn&#x27;t cheap, but it was worth it. I have skin that easily breaks out with products (reason why I had to find a new primer) and this product did not break me out. This product feels so luxurious, it really feels like you are taking good care of yourself when you use it. I bought some for my mother and she was skeptical but loves it as well. I let my best friend try mine as well and she commented how good her face felt afterwards as well. Definitely a great way to start the day and take care of yourself.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a week and am very happy with the product.  I use the size of a pebble on each side of my face.  It feels very light.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> This product is okay, it has a nice feel when I apply it, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price I paid for.  There are lots of better foundation primer than this and they are less expensive.</li>
    <li> This is the best primer I have ever used. It&#x27;s very light weight and goes on so easily. It transforms your skin into a smooth surface area ready for your makeup..Try any of the Youngblood products and see the difference</li>
    <li> This is one of my all time favorite primers. I&#x27;m an esthetician so I&#x27;ve tried several over the course of my time, but the ingredients, feel, and quality of this one goes far beyond any others. It feels like silk on your face without adding oil or shine.</li>
    <li> Once this goes on, my makeup looks flawless!! Love this product. I am literally allergic to darn near everything. I can use this with no problem. It helps my makeup appear flawless. Thank you Youndblood.</li>
    <li> Great product.... Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product.  Goes on smooth, can wear with or without make-up.  You sure get your monies worth compared to other brands.  I only buy this product and the price is so much cheaper than other brands, including buying it at day spas.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Have tried others (miracle blur) but none compare to this.  Makes skin feel like satin and powdery soft.</li>
    <li> I have been putting moisturizers on my skin because of my age (50+).  This mineral foundation works especially well.  My skin looks subtle and smooth after application, but not oily at all.  It&#x27;s fantastic!!!</li>
    <li> I love this primer, feels great on your skin and i would suggest to others looking for a primer to look at youngblood.</li>
    <li> Very smooth and makes the makeup go on smoothly.  I am enjoying it and will buy it again when I run out.</li>
    <li> i love this, makes your makeup look so flawless!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other primers and this one exceeds them all! I&#x27;ve even wore it under tanning cream and it really smooths and brightens my complexion.</li>
    <li> I am a professional make-up artist, and I love young blood. It can be a bit tricky if you dont know how to use it, but once you understand how it works it is absolutely amazing!</li>
    <li> I have used several makeup primers and had hoped this one would be different.&lt;br /&gt;I have not found primers keep makeup on longer or soften lines.&lt;br /&gt;Another waste of money !</li>
    <li> Nothing says old hag like deep wrinkles.  This product provides a light silicone barrier between your skin and foundation such that your foundation floats smoothly.  Amazing.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually buy primer because I found that anti-chafing creams in drugstores have literally the same formulation and do the same thing. I made an exception for this product because it was sold to me with the Youngblood Liquid Foundation. When I used it with the foundation, I decided that they just didn&#x27;t work well together. Maybe it is just my skin type, but the finish doesn&#x27;t look flawless and the Youngblood foundation rubs off, no matter how much powder I apply to set it. HOWEVER, I have used this primer with my Dior, By Terry, NARS, Mac, and Laura Mercier foundations, and I am very pleased with its performance. This primer is truly a pleasure to apply, it feels like rubbing liquid silk into the skin. It helps my foundation to glide on and set with a velvety finish. I especially enjoy using this with my Laura Mercier, Mac, and NARS powder foundations, because it helps them stick and give me a truly flawless finish. I feel like it creates a barrier between my foundation so that my foundation does not get trapped in my pores. It helps a small bit to cover enlarged pores, too. I don&#x27;t break out at all after wearing this all day, which I adore because my skin is very sensitive and acne-prone. In fact, my skin is abnormally calm after wearing this under my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I love about this primer is the packaging. The packaging on this product deserves 10 stars. The pump is nice, and delivers a consistent amount of product. The plastic packaging doesn&#x27;t feel cheap, it feels durable. It&#x27;s lightweight, which makes it easy to stow in a makeup bag or purse, especially because it has a pump and a cap that covers it, so no worries about it getting into my bag. The nice thing about this packaging is that as the product is pumped out, the bottom of the bottle actually moves up, so the rest of the product is pushed up to where the pump can suck it out. Ingenious! I wish my Dior Foundation was packaged like this. Did I mention that the top can also be screwed off?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I feel like primer, and especially this primer, is a luxury. It&#x27;s something that I can live without. I would repurchase this at a $20 price tag on the basis that the packaging is ingenious and a pleasure to use, and that it calms my skin. Otherwise, I could skip it.crewed off?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I feel like primer, and especially this primer, is a luxury. It&#x27;s something that I can live without.

    <li> My favorite primer by far! I&#x27;ve tried them all and this is great. Only wish it was sold in stores.</li>
    <li> I love...love the Youngblood Mineral Primer.  I received a trial size as a gift and was hooked immediately. I&#x27;m in my early thirties so my skin is not as smooth as it used to look in my 20&#x27;s. The primer&#x27;s silky formula applies on smooth and helps minimize my large pores and fine lines. I definitely recommend this product to all. It&#x27;s also PARABEN FREE!</li>
    <li> This product makes foundation application a breeze and you only need one pump. The only caution I have is to apply foundation immediately or the primer will dry and you&#x27;ll rub it off and end up with flakes.</li>
    <li> Best primer I have found &amp; I have tried most brands. Even though I am in my 30s - I have oily/combination skin with large pores - this keeps foundation from looking cakey and really helps for a more natural look. It&#x27;s silky in texture.</li>
    <li> I totally recommend this primer it moisturizes and is full of nutrients that are good for your skin, and it makes your makeup last all day</li>
    <li> I have used this product now for over 4 years and I still love it.  Powder just glides onto your skin with a smooth matte finish.</li>
    <li> Absolutely great. I&#x27;ve ordered this a few times. Doesn&#x27;t break me out, I don&#x27;t get shiny, makeup goes on smooth and stays put. Everything you could want in a primer.</li>
    <li> This makes my skin look smoother than it would with just foundation.</li>
    <li> Feels like silk. Smoothes any dryness before putting on my foundation</li>
    <li> Using this along with Youngblood Mineral Foundation. This does improve the duration and look of the foundation. I haven&#x27;t used a primer before, but don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d go back now.</li>
    <li> I saw a makeup artist recommend this product and he wasn&#x27;t wrong.  Gives a smooth slick base for your foundation, I love it and there&#x27;s a lot for the money.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a DREAM!! I have super sensitive skin...seriously like EVERYTHING breaks me out. NOT THIS ONE!! A little goes a very long way &amp; it glides on like silk! My skin LOVES this stuff!!</li>
    <li> This is a MUST in your makeup basket and don&#x27;t ever let anyone tell you otherwise. I used Victoria Secret primer before using this one and while I&#x27;m pleased with both, this seems to have an extra something. I think it&#x27;s because I have drier skin and it glides on more like argan oil than the other stuff I used which felt a little more solid. Either way, I&#x27;m sold and I&#x27;ll be buying more of this as soon as I&#x27;m out.</li>
    <li> beautiful primer - skin feels like velvet after applying and the mineral powder glides smoothly onto your face</li>
    <li> arrived quickly, just as described</li>
    <li> This is the best primer. I love using this a little goes a long way. It makes my skin feel very smooth and my makeup goes on much better when I use this. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really like all the Youngblood products.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this primer and it&#x27;s really great.  It feels good on the skin, is ready to have makeup over it really fast.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the way it makes my face feel. I don&#x27;t feel that it did anything, a waste of my money.</li>
