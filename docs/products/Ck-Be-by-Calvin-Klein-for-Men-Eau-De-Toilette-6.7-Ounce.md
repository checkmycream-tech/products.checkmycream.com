      <li>This is my favorite of the CK scents.</li>
      <li>I like One, but I love Be.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years now.</li>
      <li>and I still love the smell (not just cuz of the gf, we broke up)&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
      <li>glad i found it.</li>
      <li>I smell the lavender, bergamont, sandalwood, magnolia, and orchid mostly on my skin.</li>
      <li>I also didn&#x27;t like the pump/atomizer on the bottle which may account for my having to spray so many times</li>
      <li>I love it :)</li>
      <li>I am sure I will by some more soon.</li>
      <li>I love bergamont and lavender and this is both with touches of sandalwood and musk.  </li>
      <li>I suppose this is more \\&quot;warm/spicy\\&quot; musky where CK One has a \\&quot;cooler\\&quot; citrus scent.</li>
      <li>But I love wearing it too.</li>
      <li>the included Spray thingy(this is kind of unique and wierd about CK one and be products, that they provide the spray separately).</li>
      <li>This is the real CK eau de toilette and it smells amazing!</li>
      <li>it arrived safe and sound.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light and clean and never overpowers.</li>
      <li>I love this perfume, there were too many reviws that it&#x27;s not as good as earlier</li>
      <li>The product has some smell to it, and since this is discontinued, we&#x27;re fine for now.  </li>
      <li>Super!</li>
      <li>Very good product quality, this is all I expected to get.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I bought the products because they are cheap but found that there is a leakage in one of two bottles.</li>
      <li>Overall it was a great product/deal.</li>
      <li>But once in while he loves wearing a light scented one.</li>
      <li>This cologne is okay, but I really thought it would be better, than it is.</li>
      <li>The product comes neatly wrapped and protected and it sealed in it&#x27;s original box.  </li>
      <li>smells like the original</li>
      <li>Smelled ok, kinda like cheap pinaud, but more classy.</li>
      <li>It is clean, and you do not know you are wearing anything yourself</li>
      <li>This scent smells dark and herby; perfect for the young man or woman who dwells in the dungeons under the mystical lake filled with monsters and merpeople!</li>
      <li>Still its worth the 25$ I paid for it.</li>
      <li>It has a long lasting scent and trails more like a good soap would.</li>
      <li>Right ?</li>
      <li>right??)</li>
      <li>, the price is awesome that even half price store doesn&#x27;t even sell it this low.</li>
      <li>A good offer than the market price atleast 25 dollars less.</li>
      <li>This is a nice natural scent, that is not heavy handed.</li>
      <li>Now I think CK Be smells great, similar to the recently introduced Burberry Sport</li>
      <li>I love how smell which is less strong than her sister CK ONE.    </li>
      <li>pretty bitchin cologne</li>
      <li>Anyway, after I used it for the first time, the fragrance lasted.. may be for an hour or so...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very mysterious and sexy.  </li>
      <li>First of all, it took  10 days for me to receive the product and when I received it</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this perfume, there were too many reviws that it&#x27;s not as good as earlier but it&#x27;s as fantastic as earlier, I loved this perfume and was very happy to find it here after so many years.</li>
    <li> I was using this brand for several years and I was 100% satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;But...I got totally disappointed with its smell this time when I purchased it. Not sure whether the issue is with the seller !!!</li>
    <li> I bought this fragrance for the 1st time after smelling it on a guy at my job; since I didn&#x27;t use it when it was \\&quot;current\\&quot; over a decade ago I can&#x27;t say whether the quality has changed. When it first came out I preferred the scent of CK One which I bought in middle school in the mid-90s and still have the same bottle to this day. I suppose this is more \\&quot;warm/spicy\\&quot; musky where CK One has a \\&quot;cooler\\&quot; citrus scent. Now I think CK Be smells great, similar to the recently introduced Burberry Sport although I&#x27;m not well-versed in comparing fragrances. I fell in love with the BS but was holding out for a better deal. Then I ordered this first since it was MUCH less expensive and was satisfied enough to postpone a BS purchase indefinitely. I gave this 4/5 stars because the scent disappears FAST and I but so does BS&#x27;s IMHO, and I think I have to apply a lot. I also didn&#x27;t like the pump/atomizer on the bottle which may account for my having to spray so many times but I guess that may vary. My seller was DHL fragrance if that makes any difference. Overall it was a great product/deal. Since CK in2u is supposed to be an update to CK One,  I&#x27;m looking forward to trying that as well...</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001CT05G2 Ck Be by Calvin Klein for Men, Eau De Toilette, 6.8 Ounce]] Bad product, essence go away quikly probably was made in Chinatown N Y.</li>
    <li> I was very sad when CK announced they were going to discontinue this product.  I have been using it since 1996 and love it. I love how smell which is less strong than her sister CK ONE.    The smell will last all day and it will only be noticed on short distances which is how a perfume is supposed to be noticed.    Since the product has been discontinued, I can only get these products from the web now. It is very difficult but not impossible to find it in local stores.    My only complain is that I think the small bottle smells better than the big bottle (6.8oz) but that is just me.</li>
    <li> great price and fast delivery</li>
    <li> Something is wrong with this. Smell is different than the one I bought at shop previously, wondering if this is an original.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years now. It&#x27;s unisex, and smells great!.Everyday people ask me about my perfume.</li>
    <li> We always purchase our cologne and perfume thru Amazon and have not been disappointed.  The product comes neatly wrapped and protected and it sealed in it&#x27;s original box.  It&#x27;s everything we expect it to be!  Love not having to deal with the mall hassle!</li>
    <li> Awesome perfumed, original quality. The delivery was fast and the contents were in perfect shape.</li>
    <li> This is for men and women.  I love the smell and I like that the bottle comes with a screw on top as well as a spray top - makes traveling with it easier.</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent. great price compared to dept. stores.</li>
    <li> Good one and this is what I am looking for. No complaints for this product.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend for all the guys.</li>
    <li> My favorite, and now discontinued by Calvin Klein.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my husband to mix with CK escape so he can be like James Franco in spring breakers.... he smells nice!!! :)</li>
    <li> What can I cay about Calvin Klein Be? Well, not much since I love it since I smelled it for the first time. I am not a big fan of perfumes, for they make me sneeze a lot. But CK Be is one of the few I just cannot afford not having it on my shelf. Sometimes you can still smell its scent even after your clothes were washed and ironed. Super!</li>
    <li> Excelente producto, el despacho fue muy rápido, llegó en perfectas condiciones. Sobre el perfume es un aromo espectacular con mucha personalidad y atrevimiento, es una fragancia para seducir e impactar los sentidos, la fijación a lo largo del día depende mucho de la persona que lo usa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Datos adicionales&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Es un producto Fabricado en EEUU como dice bajo el envase, así que si compras desde Chile no pagas impuestos.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredientes: Alcohol demat, water, farfum, benzyl salicylate,linalool,hexyl cinnamal...</li>
    <li> 1) Customer service was great. Needed it faster and they delivered&lt;br /&gt;2) Smell is amazing. GIrlfriend bought this for me like last year, got this bottle a month ago and I still love the smell (not just cuz of the gf, we broke up)&lt;br /&gt;3) It does last slightly shorter than the one my gf bought me tho (same brand, smaller bottle). Maybe it&#x27;s my imagination</li>
    <li> First of all, it took  10 days for me to receive the product and when I received it the the box was not shrink wrapped and the seal was broken on the bottle and finger smudges were on the bottle. I have purchased Ck Be in the past and this is very weak. I think the product has past its shelf life or been diluted with water.  I am very disappointed and it cost too much to return it.</li>
    <li> He uses it frequently and gets compliments from others when he wears it. He was glad to receive it as a birthday gift.</li>
    <li> The size, the coolness and the impression suits well as a gift or present for men. This is a very practical gift.</li>
    <li> Excellent, the color is fine the size practic not havy easy to used is a perfect gift in tris time.</li>
    <li> this is a great smelling cologne, not overpowering and it lasts 6-8hrs. I highly recommend it! the price here on Amazon.com is waay cheaper than Nordstroms or any other big box stores, why would anyone wanna drive to the mall when you can get free delivery?</li>
    <li> My son worked for Calvin Klein and he gave me this as a gift. This replacement is as good as the original.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves it which is why I bought it, but the smell is too much for me. It&#x27;s just too thick. The smell is just a bit more spicy than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this cologne.  It&#x27;s exactly what I expected just doesn&#x27;t last as long as I had hoped.  Still its worth the 25$ I paid for it.</li>
    <li> its always my favorite kind of cologne, the price is awesome that even half price store doesn&#x27;t even sell it this low. glad i found it. definitely looking forward to get another one, perhaps boss hugo.</li>
    <li> Dont waste your money</li>
    <li> smell as good as always!</li>
    <li> I am not happy about this perfume,it&#x27;s like 1minute the smell is gone.</li>
    <li> Fragrance is nice but doesn&#x27;t last long. After 30 min you wont feel it.</li>
    <li> My husband is a bit allergic to perfume. But once in while he loves wearing a light scented one. This is A PERFECT one. Classic CK for men. But I love wearing it too. This should be for UNISEX.</li>
    <li> I bought the products because they are cheap but found that there is a leakage in one of two bottles. So the smell is all over the package and cannot give to a friend.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, reomiendo meets all specifications</li>
    <li> I got so much compliments about this cologne I had to stop wearing for a while just to avoid the attention.</li>
    <li> Smell good, nice product. Great durability.</li>
    <li> Mood elevating fragrance</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! The smell is awesome! I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again. Plus, the price was so much better than at the mall.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using &amp;#34;ck be&amp;#34; for a long time and I know how it is.&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed to open this package and realized it was not what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;This perfume does not smell!&lt;br /&gt;I bought 3 bottles for gifting friends and I was embarrassed by that situation.&lt;br /&gt;How can you help me?</li>
    <li> this cologne sucks it is not at all long lasting and smells bad !!.. dont buy this its fake .. i hate it and waste of money!!! if you still wana go for this then go for it you&#x27;ll end up writing the same review</li>
    <li> Very good no complaints</li>
    <li> Smelled ok, kinda like cheap pinaud, but more classy. A sweet and subtle smell, doesn&#x27;t last as long as other CK products in the price range which leads me to believe this is one of the less good CK colognes. It&#x27;s good for layering with a stronger smell. Gave it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have used it for almost 10 years now. When ever I buy it, I always bought it at Macy&#x27;s or Lord &amp; Taylor etc. This time, they did not have it. So, I found it obviously on AMAZON (no surprise, right??) and also to my DELIGHT, I noticed, it is way less than what I usually buy this for. I thought Wow!, this is a steal.. right??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, when I got it, I opened the cap &amp; replaced the included Spray thingy(this is kind of unique and wierd about CK one and be products, that they provide the spray separately). Anyway, after I used it for the first time, the fragrance lasted.. may be for an hour or so... After that I dont smell it at all. So, I tried it on my wrist to check it out. Actually, it does not even stay for an hour. So, I think this is an outdated Cologne that has only the alcohol left in it, but no fragrance in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I now realize why Macy&#x27;s does not carry them anymore - CK discontinued this product and sells only CK one now it seems. I am getting the CK one from Macy&#x27;s today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW - If you buy on Amazon, it is NOT RETURNABLE: Looks like I cannot return this product because of some rules with Colognes and Hazardous material. I just realized it.  At least, they should give me credit for this.</li>
    <li> Very good product quality, this is all I expected to get.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to other buyers those are thinking to buy that.</li>
    <li> it arrived safe and sound. the price was good as well as the product.I love shopping on amazon. I am sure I will by some more soon.</li>
    <li> This is the only cologne I wear. I get compliments day after day with this fragrance. It is clean, and you do not know you are wearing anything yourself ( so not overpowering), but a subtle fragrance that everyone notices.</li>
    <li> Ck Be by Calvin Klein for Men, Eau De Toilette, 6.7 Ounce&lt;br /&gt;Calvin Klein&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do you rate this product?</li>
    <li> un excelente precio, y la colonia es deliciosa, un olor bastante juvenil</li>
    <li> This must be fake! i am sorry but this doesnt even smell. I have one from my country exactly same bottle it smells different. Most probably going to ask CK to clarify.</li>
    <li> I have used it for almost 15 years. When ever I buy from Macy&#x27;s or Lord &amp; Taylor etc.&lt;br /&gt;long lasting maybe an hour, compare to the original, that obviously longer. Lesson learned, when you go to buy a fragrance, go to the authorized store, shame that fragrance is discontinued.</li>
    <li> No comment, I don&#x27;t wear it. the first bottle didnt make it through customs, in my home city no less,&lt;br /&gt;this time I packed in box shipment.</li>
    <li> Very good product as shown in the page for a very good price !! I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
    <li> i dont have to say nothing about this cologne you get what you pay for i do not like but thats my opinion</li>
    <li> This is the real CK eau de toilette and it smells amazing! This is a great buy and can be used by both men and women (in my opinion).</li>
    <li> last for one minute only</li>
    <li> This is my favorite of the CK scents. I like One, but I love Be. I love bergamont and lavender and this is both with touches of sandalwood and musk.  It&#x27;s very light and clean and never overpowers. Although it is unisex I feel it is more feminine. Maybe its just me though lol. I smell the lavender, bergamont, sandalwood, magnolia, and orchid mostly on my skin. Nothing really stands out though. It&#x27;s very mysterious and sexy.  It has a long lasting scent and trails more like a good soap would. It can be smelled from a foot away but its always mentioned as &amp;#34;what soap&amp;#34; is that rather than what perfume. I love it :)</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have noted, this is a watered down product.  And it cannot be returned.  I can certainly complain to Amazon.com and get a refund, but won&#x27;t this time.  The product has some smell to it, and since this is discontinued, we&#x27;re fine for now.  But we won&#x27;t purchase again from this seller.</li>
    <li> Whenever I wear this cologne, I have the ladies following me around. It&#x27;s amazing the reactions I get from people for the way I smell</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  I am very satisfied with it.  I would recommend it to anyone.  It is pleasant, but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> pretty bitchin cologne</li>
    <li> It took me 45 years to find a colgne I could wear well..... this is the only one.... I love it!!!</li>
    <li> This cologne is okay, but I really thought it would be better, than it is. It is a very light cologne.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected, very low odor essence, it smells more like alcohol. Wine without its protective cover, not recommended.</li>
    <li> So happy to have found this fragrance, and for the price &amp; service I&#x27;m really overjoyed!</li>
    <li> Excellent! As I expected!</li>
    <li> How can you mess this up? Why mess with perfection? Right ? Always earthy. Nice to wear, summer or winter</li>
    <li> Great for casual wear</li>
    <li> smells like the original i like</li>

    <li> I bought this cologne for my fiancé because it is one of his favorites. I had wanted to get it for him for a while but it&#x27;s so expensive. I found it on Amazon.com  for a wonderful price, plus free shipping!! I&#x27;m happy with my purchase, and my fiancé was thrilled!</li>
    <li> Great aroma, excellent presentation, good price, I will buy it when I run out. Excellent for sports people. I recommend</li>
    <li> This scent smells dark and herby; perfect for the young man or woman who dwells in the dungeons under the mystical lake filled with monsters and merpeople!</li>

    <li> en este caso todo llegó en perfecto estado no tengo quejas del producto, estuvo bien en tiempo y calidad del mismo</li>
    <li> This is a nice natural scent, that is not heavy handed. This price is affordable and toilette can be used everyday.</li>
    <li> El producto, cumple con las especificaciones descritas para el producto, es una marca que usualmente la uso el aroma me gusta mucho</li>
    <li> This is probably a very old stock, it was like splashing water as it had no fragrance what so ever. Please avoid this product,</li>
