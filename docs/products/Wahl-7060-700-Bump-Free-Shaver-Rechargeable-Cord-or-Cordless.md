<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> not the most sophisticated shaver and a bit noisy but provides a quick, close shave; that&#x27;s all I want! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Have used a Wahl razor for the last 20+ years. Can&#x27;t beat them for the closest shave, plus new screens and blades are inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I thought i would not get bumps but unfortunately i do especially when i use the gold plated foil.&lt;br /&gt;The same thing has happened to my room mate. Unfortunately it was me who recommended him to use it after reading the product information.&lt;br /&gt;I thought the bumps would clear after the skin got used to the new shaver but even after 2 months of use the bumps still come.&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely not a bump free shaver!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months.  Overall, one of the better electric shavers I&#x27;ve used because it gives me a close shave.  The main drawbacks are the fairly loud noise and the trimmer.  The good:  close shave, closer than any rotary shaver I&#x27;ve tried, about as close as a Remington I used before this and a Braun shaver I used for many years that I liked a lot.  The bad:  (1) louder than the average shaver.  My Remington was loud, too.  I put cotton balls in my ears to muffle the sound.  (2) trimmer is awkward to operate and does not remain completely extended on its own.  I have to push a finger against it to keep it fully extended.  Update (4/24/16):  in the first 18 months of use, I&#x27;ve gone through two foil heads/screens because a small break developed in them.  Each foil head/screen had the break in a different place.  I don&#x27;t remember having a problem like this so soon with other shavers, so that&#x27;s disappointing.  Otherwise, the shaver is still working fine.  The good and bad listed above still apply.  Update (1/2/17):  in the last 8 months I&#x27;ve had problems with two more foil heads/screens.  This time, they detached from the plastic shaver head while I was shaving.  Attached are pictures of the two.  I&#x27;ve used foil shavers for years and have never had a problem with the foil detaching.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a design flaw in the foil or the plastic shaver head it attaches to, but it&#x27;s a problem.  Not to mention being dangerous if I don&#x27;t notice it pop off and continue shaving.  I&#x27;ve downgraded my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars and I&#x27;m looking for a replacement shaver.</li>
    <li> This shaver it is the worst in the world i had a good thouth about it because my barber used but in my hand is poor quality shaver dont buy go for remington i used one of those for 20+ years this one fit for an emergency thats it</li>
    <li> I recommend this for a close shave without irritation that commonly comes with other products.&lt;br /&gt;With that said its not an edging tool so its good to find a second product that is primarily an edger.</li>
    <li> Used twice, first shave was close and comfortable,second i bumped worse than with a 4 blade razor, returned for refund.  Now, I have been using an old Norelco Rotary that never gave me bumps, I used it with the   Bump off Face And Beard conditioner that I bought to use with the walh and........Bumps everywhere on my face.  Now I don&#x27;t think the Wahl was that bad and will probably get another and try without The Bump Off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the Bump-Free Shaver figuring that if it works for men who get razor bumps when they shave, it&#x27;ll work for me. After all it&#x27;s supposed to be easy on the skin/face. Right? Come to find out it doesn&#x27;t cut at all. And thats with just a few days of hair growth. Which in my case doesn&#x27;t amount to a lot of facial hair. My barber uses a different type of Wahl electric foil shaver and it cuts just fine. Next time I see him, I&#x27;ll ask him where he bought that one.</li>
    <li> works best for me when used along with Wahl 9940-600 Metro Bump Prevent Shaver with T-Blade</li>
    <li> Regular razors tear up my skin but this one gives me a close shave with no irritation</li>
    <li> My barber uses the same shaver on me when i get my haircut so i knew it was a good  product. Once i used mined i received the same results and I am pleased.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t imagine a better shaver on the market at any price.  I&#x27;ve used Wahl electric shavers for at least 10-15 years and every one I&#x27;ve purchased has been great.  This new one is just as great as the several others I&#x27;ve owned through the years.</li>
    <li> I looked at Panasonic, Braun, Remington, and Norelco.  I decided on the Wahl Bump-Free Shaver.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  First shave was as close as a blade and I have been a blade user all my life.  The best thing of all is it is made in the USA!    Last piece of advice - if you can&#x27;t make up your mind buy the Wahl you won&#x27;t be sorry!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this shaver. It&#x27;s cheaply made, not the quality I have seen from Wahl in the past. My older shaver&#x27;s foils broke (that happens) and the charger stand fell apart, so I ordered a new one. With the new shaver, the trimmer didn&#x27;t come out easily and when it was out it was too flimsy; you don&#x27;t want to trim sideburns or a beard with it. So, after returning it, I called Wahl and discovered a silver lining to all this. They have great factory support. I bought new foils at a very low price, and they give free shipping. I can rebuild my older shaver and keep on using it. Need parts? Their number is 1-800-767-9245. The parts are less expensive from the factory than from most of the online shops I found.</li>
    <li> Did a lot of research in trying to decide whether or not to even start using an electric shaver instead of the clippers that I&#x27;ve been using for the last 15 years.  Decided to try this shaver based on other review and testimonies, but was disappointed with the results after first use. Product did not come close to providing a \\&quot;close\\&quot; shave.  Returned it and purchased a Norelco 8000 series shaver and immediately upon first use, got the closest shave I&#x27;ve had since I stopped using depilatories.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver ! A lil loud but works very well. I use it to shave my face ,head &amp; neck. I use clipper 2 get my hair low as possible then go over it with these shavers. Im very pleased wit this product &amp; not affect by hair bumps like when i tried other electric shavers or shaving razors. Just follow the instructions &amp; im sure u will be pleased.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, easy-to-hold shaver provides and extremely smooth and close shave, with never any irritation.    I am pleasantly surprised at the superiority of this model compared to my previous Wahl shaver and other dreadfully inadequate shavers such as Norelco, and even the expensive Braun.</li>
    <li> I was very unhappy with this product.  I was unable to get a close shave despite using a electric pre-shave face lotion.  It pulled at my facial hairs and I needed to press harder than usual against my face to get any type of sufficient shave.  I purchased this product to help eliminate the few razor bumps on my face.  It only served to irritate my face even more.  To top it off, part of the shaver&#x27;s exterior screen broke off.  I would have asked for a refund, if I had not misplaced my receipt.</li>
    <li> This electric razor is the best!! Especially for men who don&#x27;t or can&#x27;t use a razor. I am a barber and was amazed how close it cut. Please not that the bulk of the hair on the face should be cut off with clippers such as the andis t-outlinder, styliner, or wahl liners, prior to using this tool or it will not work at it&#x27;s greatest potential. In some instances it may be necessary to pull the skin of the face taunt to get the closest shave. FYI.. this is the same electric razor as the 5 star shaver by wahl, (I called wahl to confirm) the only difference is the color of the housing.</li>
    <li> This shaver is worth its weight in gold.  It gets so close but doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling burned.  I recommended this shaver to my brother who is now a happy user as well.</li>
    <li> I just got this in the mail today and gave it a try. I got a decent shave in just a few minutes. It is noisy and does vibrate a lot, but it&#x27;s an electric, so that&#x27;s to be expected. I have yet to try the trimmer, but it seems overall to be a good shaver. It&#x27;s not quite as close as a blade, but until I can find a barber who still knows how to use a straight razor, it&#x27;ll do.</li>
    <li> horrible product...never again</li>
    <li> When  I first came to us my girlfriend who is my wife now bought me a remington shaver I used it twice and gave it to my brother in law in Haiti because that shaver gave me too many bumps . I&#x27;m using the andi&#x27;s shaver which is bumpless for more than 15 years, but it doesn&#x27;t shave my face close enough. In fact, two months ago my real barber  wasn&#x27;t at the shop ,and I dicided to use a different one who used the \\&quot;Wahl shaver\\&quot; this did not burn my skin ; curiously, I asked him what&#x27;s the brand of this shaver he said Whal. Then after a few days I did not notice any bumps. This week,  tuesday 3th,2010 the same barber used the wahl shaver and I do not have any problem; that&#x27;s right I came on line  to check  on the price of these great shavers. I  still don&#x27;t have one yet, but I&#x27;ll definitely buy it when the money comes.</li>
    <li> I replaced a more expensive Remington shaver with the Wahl.  I like the Wahl much better.  It shaves closer and is not so likely to leave long hairs, the way the Remington did. It will reach under my nose to shave my beard and is effective at shaving my ears and around my sideburns.  Where it does miss long hairs, the pop up clippers will get them. It also holds a charge better than the Remington.  I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> The shaver does a pretty good job. Its quite loud though, and leaves behind hair. Very long battery life as long as ur not using the trimmer side alot</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Holds a charge very well.  Made in USA.  Replacement blades are available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> While every experience is different and personal, this razor has been great for me.  I will try to tell you why.    If you are expecting to just yank this unit out of the box and get a great shave, let me know how that goes for you.  In general, I have found that you have to sort of \\&quot;tweak\\&quot; your shaving routine using this razor (oh, and follow the instructions).      I have read that some people do not like the trimmer. I can see where this might be the case.  It&#x27;s a little less than precision.  So, I do not use it myself for all kinds of trimming.  However, I do use it as part of my daily shaving routine.  For me, it works better if I use the trimmer to go over the entire face first, and then follow up with the electric razor, which then gives me a very close shave (but not so close as to cause bumps).  You see, the trimmer actually sort-of scratches the skin a little, which has the effect of dislodging and redirecting hairs that may be trying to grow back into the skin.  Then those hairs stand up and can be cut by the razor when it passes over. This may not make sense at first, but trust me, it is the reason I get a good shave and do not get razor bumps.  Yes, I would get a good shave without the trimmer, but I get a much better one with it.  I do not, however, use it to trim my mustache (but I do use it for my sideburns and back of the neck).    I have to remind myself that the primary purpose of this razor is to keep me from getting razor bumps, and that any trimming job it does, is icing on the cake.    As a testimony, it is 4:03 p.m. as I write this, and my face still feels smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind, even though I shaved early this morning!  Plus, I do not have razor bumps, which I used to have all the time!  This shaver has been everything I expected and more.  Again, every man is different, and for some, this just does not work.  Yet, for me, the problems were minimal-or-non-existent.  I got what I paid for, and more...and no, I do not work for this companyor any of its affiliates(smile).    Additionally, though some have said they get better results when using a pre-shave lotion, I do not use any lotions or creams before shaving.  Some people can do that, but I find it works better for me the other way around...I use those kinds of things (electric shave lotion, toners, aloe-vera, or after-shaves) afterward.  When I was doing it the other way, I wasn&#x27;t getting as close a shave. That said, I have been using this razor for several years now and am 100% satisfied.  I have had maybe one or two bumps (no joke) since I started using this razor. I have never known ANY other device to so the same thing, and I&#x27;ve been shaving and experimenting for at least 40 years!    It may be a little loud for some people; I guess, but the noise is nothing, really.  I have noticed it more on the trimmer side, but even then, it is not off-putting to me.  Besides, I would rather get the fine shave I am getting, than get a worse shave from a quieter model.  It may also be good to remember that my opinion is based upon the fact that at the time I bought this unit, I was looking for something less expensive...so a quieter sound may be optional.    Anyway, this works well for me, but I had to learn the best way to do it.  I did not have trouble with how the unit worked.  It did not eat my skin at any time.  It is fast.  It does a great job.  Incidentally, the battery is incredible, and allows the unit to remain strong for many shaves, especially if you plug it in between shaves...great if you travel a lot!    I hope this helps, if you are trying to decide if this is the one for you.  Not everyone will have the same experience, but it may help to know that not everyone has had a nightmare experience either.    Cheers!</li>
    <li> This is my second razor from wahl.  this razor performs great.  The razor was packaged well and was received in good condition..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wished that wahl  would change the battery in the razor  to a better battery than the NiCad battery..  in my previous wahl razor i&#x27;d  changed the battery out of it after the warranty  ran out to a Nickel metal hydride battery and it performed better than the NiCad battery.  the NiCad battery was invented in the 1960&#x27;s and they (the battery)  will reverse polarity  if left not charged all the time over a long time...&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you</li>
    <li> What can I say about a Wahl shaver. I had one before and loved it. That&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t hesitate one minute to buy this one. If and when it wears out I&#x27;ll buy another one. Great service on the shipping too.</li>
    <li> I gave this shaver what i consider a good try and ended up with what i take is a adequate effort! My biggest problem is the closeness of the shave NOT CLOSE ENOUGH FOR ME!Now mind you this subjective on my part but when you take in to account that i used the Remington Titanium (formerly the Black Man&#x27;s Shaver also by Remington) for years this is basically comparison shopping. My Remington stopped holding a charge after years of usage so i decided to try something new. Not a wise choice! Probably in time i will go back to the Remington.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd one, the first lasted for 5 years. These are the best I have ever used and I have tried them all.  They give a close comfortable shave and the replacement screens are very reasonable.</li>
    <li> My facial hair is very curly and this shaver does a poor job on curly hair. POOR JOB! Leaves patches of hair on your head and face.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after using it at a barber shop. I like the shaver but I didn&#x27;t like the barbers using each others so I got my one. Very close shave almost razor like since I can&#x27;t use a razor, before you use the razor you need to break down the hair with the t liners or edgers. Shaver is a little loud, but it pays off for the super close shave. Great buy!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an african american man who is entering into the US Military soon.  As such, I&#x27;ll need to shave, everyday.  Normally I&#x27;d never shave because to do so would be a painful experience.  It would expose the razor bumps I had while adding more.    Using a manual razor didn&#x27;t work.  And it&#x27;s not because blacks can&#x27;t use razors.  I&#x27;ll be the first to admit it was my technique.  Be it the angle, the pressure, finding the grain which is difficult since it goes all over the place, in the end I&#x27;d end up covered in nicks and even more ingrown hairs, regardless of whether it was a cheap bic or a skin flaying 4 blade monster.  In the end I wasn&#x27;t willing to trial and error my face until it was covered in scars.    I tried a Norelco rotary.  The problem with that was shaving with the grain didn&#x27;t cut nearly low enough, and shaving against did what it said it would do.  Lift and cut, causing the hair to fall under the skin and cause the hair to get trapped and insane amounts of swelling and weeks of me trying to get it out.  So that didn&#x27;t work either.      Then I saw this.  A foil shaver, and not only that, but one that is specifically designed in a number of ways to prevent razor bumps and irritation.  It works like an absolute dream.  It cuts low, so that it&#x27;s AT, the skin level, so even going against the grain I can barely feel it, if I can feel it at all.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin whatsoever so my face doesn&#x27;t feel raw after sliding it across my face.  It&#x27;s a little loud but I&#x27;m not gonna trade a loud quality shave for the quiet tugging and pulling I experienced with the norelco and the bumps.    A word of warning, this is pretty much only for cutting stubble.  And by that I mean you need to use it everyday.  It&#x27;s perfect for cutting about 24 hours of growth, and pretty much nothing else.  The good thing is it comes with a small battery powered clipper addition that can be used to get it trimmed down to stubble length, then followed up with the Super Close as it&#x27;s labeled.  So in conjunction they work  excellently if you go a few days without shaving.    So yea, this was a first review so excuse me if it&#x27;s a little long winded, I&#x27;m just thrilled to have FINALLY found something that works consistently, every time, with no hassle.</li>
    <li> I have had remmington, norelco and braun electrics in the past. I used electrics to knock down the beard so I can get a close shave with a blade. For many people the multiple blade (2,3,4, and even 5) razors clog instantly with beard, making multiple blades a useless waste of money. To solve that requires a two step process. Electric followed by blade. This is the closest electric I have ever used. It is so close I don&#x27;t follow with a blade every time. (Once and a while when I want to be real sure)    It does not leave areas on the face that require unique hand movements to get like all the others I have tried. Mostly this is a first pass shaver.    Others have noted the lack of ergo design and grips. True, but this device does not weigh very much and is easy to handle. It is not like you are holding it all day. A shave takes about a minute.    My only complaint is the AC charger is rated for north american voltages only. Traveling to countries using higher voltages requires a transformer converter rather than a simple plug adapter. The AC charger has the look and feel of a switch mode device rather than a transformer type which typically work with all voltages. I suspect it would work fine, and the problem is in the label only.    The gold foil is very nice against the skin, looks cool as well.</li>
    <li> I have always had a rotary electric razor and used them just for \\&quot;touch-ups\\&quot;.  This Wahl razor is so close and effective, I have gradually changed to using it as my main shaver.  If there is one drawback, it is very noisy.  But, unless you are trying to shave while hiding, that&#x27;s not a problem!  This was a bargain for quality and for the price.  This is a winner!  Bill Scott - Hays, KS</li>
    <li> The shaver actually performed just as I was informed it would.  As an African-American male I needed a shaver that would give me a close shave, but not so close that it would cause irritation or ingrown hairs.  The reason for not giving it five stars is because it&#x27;s has to be by far the loudest shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> very good for sensitive skin...dont forget to cover the foil after using because its hard to find a replacement it seems</li>
    <li> This product is overrated. Either that or it&#x27;s definitely not for me. Was using a Wahl hair clipper for shaving and had moderate bumps only on my neck area. Did some research and found this one supposedly for black men. Have been using this for a couple of months now and even though I get a clean shave, the bumps have worsened and now cover my entire neck area, parts of my cheek and my jaw. In fact as I write this I&#x27;ve had to stop shaving entirely to allow the bumps time to heal. Don&#x27;t know how long I can get away with this at the office cos the nature of my job means I have to be clean shaven at all times. Well my search continues.</li>
    <li> THIS WAHL BUMP FREE SHAVER IS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.  1. IT SOUNDS AND FEELS LIKE A LAWN MOWER  2. IT REALLY DOESN&#x27;T SHAVE ANY BETTER THAN HAIR CLIPPERS  3. IT TOOK WAHL/AMAZON OR THEIR 3RD. PARTY SHIPPER \\&quot;PICK ONE\\&quot; MORE THAN 3 WEEKS TO GET IT TO ME, WHY?, THEIR SHIPPER WAS ON VACATION!!!</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing this shaver.  The other one still works, however, I had to order another one because I broke the adapter and you cant purchase the adapter by itself.  I must say, as a black male this is probably the closest shave you will get without major irritation.  I still get a few razor bumps, but nothing like if I were using a razor.  When using this shaver I typically have to trim my facial hair first with my t-edjer, without trimming first the bump free shaver won&#x27;t trim/cut your facial hair.  The t-edjer gets it low enough for you to use the bump free shaver.  All in all, I would have to say it gets the job done well enough for you to step out the house with a clean shave.  I wish there was something better, but I think this is as good as it gets for African-American males. I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I wanted a closer shave vs. using the T-outliner&#x27;s everyday. The wahl product delivered that and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. Be warned, allow your skin to get accustomed to that shaver for the first weeks. But after that, your shave will be so soft. I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to try this product!!! One thing, this shaver is loud!!!! But its worth it!!!</li>
    <li> This works exactly as advertised.    You need to give yourself a trim first with a normal shaver.  Once you are just down to short stubble then you break out this Wahl Bump-Free shaver.  It&#x27;ll get it down to feeling very smooth.    Don&#x27;t use this to try to shave off your beard.  That&#x27;s not what it is for.  First get a close trim with stubble using some other trimmer.  Then use this one.      I&#x27;ve been very pleased with how it works.    After a while, the foil will break up.  You can get a replacement.  You don&#x27;t need to replace the entire shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it was made in the USA.  And because of that especially I really wanted to like it.  I bought this as a second shaver to keep at work.  It does not do any better of a job than my Norelco at home, which is not saying much.  But the real issue I have with it is that its vibration level is VERY pronounced.  Its not really comfortable to use for a full shave.     The shaver comes was a seperate small battery operated trimmer.  That trimmer actually works great, especially for running off a AA battery.  But I bought this thing for the shaver and its just not that good at all.</li>
    <li> this shaver did not work for me at all patches, irritatin, so i got the andis headliner for perfect shaves.</li>
    <li> Not a good product for me. I&#x27;ll never buy another. Total waste of money. Does not shave close at all. Leaves as much hair as it removes. Too much irritation. I tried it with and without preshave. I get much better results with the Norelco H8000 series.</li>
    <li> I got this product in 08 and was so disappointed in it that I haven&#x27;t used it since. I forgot I had it until I looked through past orders. When I did use this product instead of keeping me Bump-Free I grew almost as many hair bumps as when I use a regular razor. Didn&#x27;t do as described, beware if you are prone to hair bumps avoid this shaver</li>
    <li> I gave this a 5 star rating for quick delivery and many years of service from basically the same shaver.  My old one need new cutters, new blades and a battery.  The cost of repairs was more than a new shaver and the cost of the new one was very reasonable.  Some folks feel the operating noise is too high but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  It&#x27;s made in the USA which I feel is not only different but desirable.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a result of looking for a electric shaver. IT was my first time using one. I use my Andies clippers for shaving my head and face but I was looking for a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I order the Bump free shaver about 3 weeks ago and finally put it to use today. I shaved my head and face with my Andies first, than after I was finished, I followed up with the Wahl shaver. To my surprise, I was impressed. IT was a very close shave and it left me with the \\&quot;razor shave\\&quot; feel. My face felt very \\&quot;clean\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did buy this razor based on the positive reviews. If you&#x27;re a black male that cannot use a razor but you&#x27;d like the razor look and feel, this is the shaver to buy. You be happy you did.</li>
    <li> Not as close of a shave as I would like it, although still a close shave and definitely bump-free.</li>
    <li> Brought for my son he specifically asked for it. He had one before and said he wanted another because it shaves very close and he doesn&#x27;t get bumps. He is very happy with it. I could only find it anywhere so I am glad for amazon.com.</li>
    <li> This shaver is ok.  It is not as good as Remington&#x27;s old Black Man&#x27;s Shaver.  It does not cut the single strands of fine hair.  It does cut short stubble well.  For the money though it does ok.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to try something new to see if its better than the normal T-edgers I normall use to Shave.  This did not even come close.  I even gave it to my roomate to try after I desanitized it with alcohol.  It didn´t work on his skin either.  He is a white guy and I am a black guy.  It didn´t work for either of us.  I followed all the instructions charging to shaver.  Do not buy.</li>
    <li> I had to use this along another razor to get to the level that is appropriate. Too cumbersome to have to use both.</li>
    <li> The metal guard broke after about 3 weeks of usage and cut my face pretty bad it.</li>
    <li> I have had a similar history as one other reviewer. Razors left me with razor bumps so I used a set of hair trimmers. This leaves a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at 7:00 a.m. which was not much of a problem when I was younger with black hair. Now that I have gray speckles my gray stubble looks like powdered donut dust. I was skeptical about spending so much on an electric razor as my experience with them in the past was equally bad as razors.    Pros: Closer shave than with trimmers or &#x27;bump-free&#x27; razors. Powerful battery. Easy to clean. Close-cutting trimming attachment. NO BUMPS!    Cons: Loud, but that adds to the manly factor. It does leave some some areas not as close as others but you can use the trimmer attachment for hard-to-get hair. The foil shreds easily if too much pressure if used. It&#x27;s easy to apply too much pressure if the first past does not not cut close enough.    Make no false assumptions. I&#x27;m not going to have as smooth a face as I had at 14yo but it is much smoother than what I had from 24 to 34 yo.</li>
    <li> Just like a razor close shave i reccommend this to any male who wants a close shave like a razor .</li>
    <li> I was really excited about this shaver so I could shave twice a week for work. This shaver barely shaved any hair, i even tested it on my arm hair and it too nothing off. Being an African American male I suggest Andis T-liner[[ASIN:B000143C0K Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer] to shave and use rubbing alcohol] to prevent bumps.</li>
    <li> I have been known all my adult life for not shaving like I should.Now thanks to this razor I bought recenly I shave every day and it does an almost razor blade type job.  Monty.</li>
    <li> This shaver gives a really close shave.  Product works just as advertised.  I even take mine to the barber shop with me so my barber can use it on me rather than his shaver!    -VIH</li>
    <li> Upon receiving the Bump-Free Shaver I read the instructions and immediately charged it.  Initially, I was skeptical about using it because I had tried numerous products and had not found one that met my needs. I would either get five o&#x27;clock shadow, skin irritation or be extremely bumpy.   I have been delighted since I began using the Bump - Free Shaver.  I have not had any issues with five o&#x27;clock shadow, skin irritation or bumps.  I can use the shaver on a regular basis and get a good close shave.  I would recommend the shaver to anyone desiring to get a close shave without the skin irritation and razor bumps.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly as advertised.  My recommendation when using this device is not to shave away from the grain. I did experience minor razor bumps when doing so but not when shaving with the grain.  The only really negative is that the product is VERY loud. Not that the volume would even be an issue for me except that it is loud to the point where I could actually see it affecting some people with more sensitive hearing. I definately recommend this product (just buy a pair of ear plugs).</li>
    <li> I have tried the Wahl Bump-Free shaver for nearly three weeks now.  I am just now starting to get the close shave that it supposed to give, but there is a catch.  You have to use it when your beard is stubbly and very short, not thick, as I have curly hair.  It will not cut long beards as effectively, and  I had to shave with a disposable razor to get the close shave that I want after using the shaver.  Also, this is the first shaver that I have used with a hypoallergenic/microthin foil.  I have noticed some pink lines on my right cheek and a small dent which could have come from my using the shaver and trimmer to take off some of the hair, as it is a bit sharp.  The good news is that there are no shave bumps to be found, but I&#x27;ll still keep using it as it takes a while to get a close shave with it.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because the product was shipped to me on time, and the product was everything I wanted it to be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great product, just took a long time to get it. Do to the bad weather I guess? Powerfull shaver. Works better than any ever bought.</li>
    <li> I have used Wahl products in the past and have been very satisfied. However I find that the cheaping of the product by not providing a case is an error on Wahls part. If your going to provide a quality product why not go all the way and provide a case as you did in the past.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver to replace a Wahl 4000 shaver. I dropped the last two 4000&#x27;s and they both stopped working. Not the best construction. Since this happened to two 4000&#x27;s I decided to try a cheaper Wahl this time. As with the 4000, this shaver gives me the absolute closest shave I have ever gotten from an electric shaver (Panasonic, Remmington, etc..) with no iriitation whatsoever. I never thought I could get such a close shave with an electric shaver. My growth is medium to heavy. It is smaller in the hand than the 4000 with similar plastic construction (I will try not to drop it!). I would have given it 5 stars but had to deduct one star because of the noise level. It is a VERY loud shaver! If you can live with that you will get a fantastic shave.</li>
    <li> For those of us who have problems with razor bumps you know how hard it is to find something that&#x27;s going to work well and keep your face feeling good for the long haul.  This machine does it!  It&#x27;s a grind, you have to go over and over again because it&#x27;s designed to keep from cutting the hair below the surface.  But when you&#x27;re done it&#x27;s baby smooth, lasts and easy to do again with the same results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does include a trimmer in the package so that you can first trim the hair if it&#x27;s of any length before shaving. Also surprised how well the little trimmer works!  Update: April 2016: Finally died.</li>
    <li> Works fine. Very close to the skin and the trimmer is precise. Just a little to loud to me. Just what l expected.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this product to work because I am tired of using an Edger or Magic Shave.  I like this razor, but it only cuts about 80% of my facial hair.  It cuts the lip and chin area perfectly, but under the chin and the sides it simply does not cut completely.  I have tried everything, every angle, nothing works.  The instructions said to give it three weeks which I did to no avail.  I tried to return and now they are giving me a hard time because I followed the instructions and used for three weeks.  Buy at your own risk.</li>
    <li> I have a tough beard and can ruin a quad blade in a couple of days, had a wahl for about 5 years, it was still going strong, replaced the foil every year but it got knocked off the sink and damaged so I bought another one to replace it&lt;br /&gt;pros - close shave, long lasting&lt;br /&gt;cons - none&lt;br /&gt;recommend to friend - yes</li>
    <li> I have used a trimmer to shave for the last 14 years. When my hair was black the stubble was not a problem because my 5:00 o&#x27;clock shadow did not appear until 5:00 o&#x27;clock. Since much of beard has turned white and I have dark skin my white stubble was apparent before I left the house.    About three months ago I experimented with a safety razor with a bump guard and their shaving cream. The shave was close but I still have scars from the razor bumps the razor created. I went back to my trimmer!    I did not give up and did more searches on the web and found the Wahl Bump-Free Shaver. It has worked like a charm! I now have a very close shave with minimal problems! The other good news is the Shaver Choice produces I bought with the safety razor work ell with the Wahl Bump Free Shaver.    The one issue I have with the razor is it is too noisy. The trimmer in the back is a nice feature and will use when I travel. When I am at home I still prefer my Wahl trimmer to cut my sideburns and the odd hair that lays flat on my face that the Wahl shave cannot cut.    Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase!</li>
    <li> It works wonderfully well!  This is my 3rd Wahl ... I wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else.  And best yet, it&#x27;s American made.</li>
    <li> The Wahl Bump-Free Shaver is a nice shaver for those who cannot use your typical razor, however the trimmer portion of the shaver is somewhat useless still have to use my trimmers.</li>
    <li> Does a terrible job shaving.  It left my head with cuts all over.  Used it once and will never again. Best way is to use a Mach 3 razor and shaving cream.  DO NOT WAST YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t exactly say its bunp-free cos after the first few usages, I couldn&#x27;t stop the bumps from coming. I guess it&#x27;s an indvidual thing. The battery lasts quite long enough after a full charge. Easy to operate.</li>
    <li> My beard is so tough I have to blade shave in the shower and then use an electric for the final \\&quot;polish\\&quot;. Disgusted with the typical \\&quot;modern\\&quot; foil razor? Read on and you will be grateful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Powerful motor, high capacity battery, very large cutting surface, a true \\&quot;lawnmower\\&quot;. This razor can cut off the toughest beard in moments (not even minutes). It shaves very close. What is with the \\&quot;Bump-Free\\&quot;? I don&#x27;t know, maybe it does help people with very curly hair but I purchased it because of my long experience with foil razors and my engineering background. All the recent foil razors are moving to more heads, three or four. The more heads, the smaller the head&#x27;s curvature and since they are next to each other only the tip top of the head is touching the skin and doing any cutting. In reality, a single foil head with a gentle curve has more exposed cutting surface than a multi-head razor. The two WIDE and large heads on this razor provide a huge cutting surface and the powerful motor with high capacity battery power to back it up make this a breath of fresh air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have spent too much time and money on supposedly \\&quot;high end\\&quot; razors. You know the ones, the fancy cleaning systems, the three or four or more heads. Who and where do they test those things? Barely-there beards on men in the far-east? (No I am not prejudice, gee give me a break!) This must be the case because they are all made in that area of the world. They are all humbled by the Wahl. AND believe it or not, it&#x27;s made in the USA.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as my old Remington shaver.  Thought I would try something new, but should&#x27;ve known better.  The shave is not as close as I&#x27;m used too and after charging it for almost 3 days I still have to keep going over areas that my old shaver cuts better.  The sad part is I haven&#x27;t changed my old shaver head in over 5 years and it still works better.  I don&#x27;t have much facial hair and shave 2-3 times a month.</li>
    <li> Sadly, this shaver just did not mesh well with me. I was really excited for this Wahl shaver, for I have been wanting one of these for a long time. Unfortunately, it wasn&#x27;t all I thought it would be. It did a poor job of shaving away all the hair on my face (No, it wasn&#x27;t long) and it left my skin very irritated and I would get razor bumps just the same. I always had to shave one day in advance of having to be anywhere, because anytime I&#x27;d shave my face would be burning for a good while, even despite applying aftershave balm and whatnot. Sadly, I had to return the razor, so I can&#x27;t quite recommend it. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so maybe someone would love this whereas I was unable to.</li>
    <li> Pros: Really good and close shave. comes w/ everything you need for a close clean shave    Cons: should come with 2 Gold foil heads and razor heads b/c they are flimsy when removing to clean</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for quite some time now but it does not give me a close shave.  Would not recommend this product for purchase if you are a black man looking for a clean close shave.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver to accompany my husband when he is admitted to a nursing home, which required an electric shaver. His old one was getting ineffectual, so on his barber&#x27;s advice I ordered a Wahl. It arrived in fine shape, but when I turned it on, it was so noisy it startled me and upset my husband whose Alzheimer&#x27;s makes him fearful of loud noise and dictates the nursing home for him. I put cotton in his ears and tried the shaver. It removed nothing but the shortest hairs. Longer ones missed previously would not budge. So it sits in the closet, a new razor that will never be used. Amazon&#x27;s accepting a return if unopened is of no use to me. My experience was NOT a good one.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to replace a previous Wahl Bump-Free Shaver. The shaver I wanted is discontinued. The edger part of the shaver was too sharp for my skin, it pulled and grabed the skin. It may work for you but not for me.  J. Jackson</li>
    <li> So far so good I have been using this shaver for a couple of weeks now and have no complaints. This thing is loud, my wife complains that it wakes her up in the norning if i use it in our bathroom so unless i feel like upsetting her i&#x27;ll generally use the other bathroom. As a Soldier I have had to use majic shave almost since i started shaving which works well as far as the bumps, but it&#x27;s a pain and very time consuming. Now i can finally wake up in the morning shave and not worry about bumps a couple of days later great product.</li>
    <li> Loud obnoxious noise - check  Irritating post shave feeling - check  razor bumps - check     it&#x27;s been two 1/2 weeks and i am still trying to grow out my beard to pull out the ingrown hairs.  This supposed bump free shaver has caused me more trouble than its worth.</li>
    <li> I am using this product simply because I struggle with razor bumps and razor burns. This shaver is a solution that was recommended to my by my doctor. I have used several products before such as disposables and evens electric razors. The closest shave I have ever gotten was from a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power and sometimes a Schick Quattro Titanium Trimmer that I have. Unfortunately those blades also caused me to have razor bumps/burn so I had to change asap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product comes with a separate trimmer that needs AA batteries. It&#x27;s a pretty decent trimmer definitively not the best. No problem, because as the name implies, it&#x27;s just there to make the beard hairs shorter. The shaver itself is sensitive on the skin so it doesn&#x27;t hurt me in the slightest. And it does a pretty good job on getting in close. Now the only problem is that it takes a lot of time to get a full shave on the face. You&#x27;ll be stroking the same area for a while to get the hairs out. But once you&#x27;re finished shaving you&#x27;ll be happy with the results. Your face will be bump free and smooth. However, as I stated earlier, you&#x27;ll need to be patient because the shaver sometimes \\&quot;misses\\&quot; some hairs and if you don&#x27;t inspect your face after every few strokes or after you&#x27;re done, you will find that small areas of your face still have some facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another con is that cleaning the shaver is pain! You eject the top in a push of a button and use the provided brush to brush of the hairs. This is time consuming and can be frustrating as well. You&#x27;d expect a greater amount of ease when using this product considering the hefty price tag. Especially if you&#x27;re used to wet shaving or using a blade (By the way this is a dry shaver for all you first time shavers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the shaver does it&#x27;s job in the sense that it leaves me bump free (the reason I bought this shaver) and my face is smooth. But leaves hair in my beard area way to often. Gives a close shave but no on the entire beard area and it&#x27;s annoying going over the same area and still not getting the hair out. I just wish it was easier to clean and got the hair out of my face faster. As I stated earlier, I expected more than what I got considering the price. Fixes my razor bump problem but the shave is not as good as the straight razor blade I used to use. I would get this if you&#x27;re in desperate need of a shaver that doesn&#x27;t give you razor bumps.ng going over the same area and still not getting the hair out.

    <li> LOL, I&#x27;ve never used the 5 star model, but they must shave closer than these. These don&#x27;t put razor bumps on your face because they don&#x27;t shave close enough to irritate anything!!! What a rip -off. I have to go over my face at least 20 times just to feel like I made a difference. When driving to work in the morning, between this shaver and my coffee I could find myself around a light pole, it takes just that much attention from the driving. I got this crappy shaver because I grew up having my dad cut the4 of us brother&#x27;s hair with a Wahl. I thought I got a good cut then, but looking back on my younger days, I was no BILLY DEE with the Babes either. Now I realize why.......it was those CRAPY Wahl clippers making me look like I had a f@*$#@ up DOO. I&#x27;m through with this shaver I&#x27;m tossing it out the window before the cord gets a short in it, like  Wahl clippers usually do. Thanks guys for your raving reviews of this product, but unlike you all, I don&#x27;t have skin as thick as BIGFOOT. Finally, I&#x27;ve become Billy with the s*$@&amp; shave.</li>
    <li> This has been one of the better products he&#x27;s tried.  He likes it and has used this shaver several times.</li>
    <li> Shaves closer than a straight razor and with less skin irritation. This is the same tool as Wahl&#x27;s 5 Star Shaver, but the black and gold looks better, plus it come with a pop-up side burn blocker. It&#x27;s just an awesome tool for personal use or for a barbering.</li>
    <li> This Item came fairly quickly. The razor itself is good, but I must confess I use the little push up razor more than the gold plated shaver. For people who get irritation from a blades and shaving cream, this is a very good option.</li>
    <li> easy to use and very cheap, i had troubles shaving my neck, anyways i recommend for persons that does not have very bad bear (strong).</li>
    <li> Extremely disappointed.  Battery only lasts about 45-90 seconds and that is regardless of whether it is cordless or plugged in. Nothing else bad to say, the battery problem is so problematic that nothing else really matters.</li>
    <li> This is my second Wahl shaver, the first one wore out after over 10 years of daily use. These shavers do a great job, shave quick and very close, are flexible in use with cord or cordless and best of all cost a fraction of the German or Japanese products.</li>
    <li> I love the Wahl brand Shaver, they last forever. Overall I have owned 2 in my lifetime, this is my 3rd. The only reason I had to buy a new one is because the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore and i didnt want to have to have it plugged in to use it. It doesnt irritate my skin at all, I love this shaver. It leaves my skin nice &amp; smooth &amp; it has the pop up shaver on back to get the longer hair which some models don&#x27;t have.</li>
    <li> This shaver consistently left hair a quarter of an inch long on his beard, and then died a few months after purchase. It sucks and I am going to try to get my money back.</li>
    <li> This product works great.  Very few bumps. I also use Bump Stopper its a after shave cream, now i have baby soft skin, this is by far the best shaver i have ever owned, and better than magic shave. i had to thank my barber thats where i discovered it, it was the closest shave i ever had so i went online and bought one for my self, that was 4 months ago. Now i am back on Amazon to buy the replacement foil it lasted about 4 months, Great product!</li>
    <li> The Wahl 7060-700 bump-free shaver is  the best shaver that I have ever had it cuts close ,  and leav free of bumps . I highly recommened this product. I compared this shaver with andis and for some reason iseem to use this more .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried using this shaver several times over a month to shave the stubble off my bald head.  It just doesn&#x27;t work on thick coarse hair.  The way the shaver and foil is constructed to operate, it is difficult to see how you can get a super close shave or even a regular shave. Maybe that&#x27;s why they call it a bump free shaver.  The side trimmer works fine but who wants hair all over the place?  Plus the trimmer is too small for the entire head.  This shaver is very LOUD and it sounds as if it is actually shaving something but while using my magnified mirror, there are no hairs being cut!  I read the instructions and it says to use it EXCLUSIVELY for three to four weeks or more to get the great shave you are looking for.&amp;#34;  Well why use it if it isn&#x27;t cutting initially? This gadget is a rip off!  Don&#x27;t waste your money!  I would ask for a refund but the 30 days have passed.</li>
    <li> The Shaver is being returned today to the manufacturer. I received an excellent first shave and that was it. The shaver quit. But, since I have had many products from Wahl over the years I contacted the company by telephone and they sent me a UPS label to return the product for a replacement. The motor goes fast, then slow, then slower, then slower yet and stops. A possible short ?  . . . I placed the head and cutter blades on my 4,000 Wahl and continued to get an excellent shave. I will report back to this site after I get the new unit. In 32 years this is the first defective product I have received-new-from Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: December 13, 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Wahl and did not send the product back to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;UPS is two blocks from my house. Wahl sent a UPS label. I returned the product to Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks later Wahl had a new shave in my hands and it works fantastic like all the others.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Wahl Corporation.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift.  It shaves wonderfully well.&lt;br /&gt;So far, working great.  Product packaging excellent&lt;br /&gt;as well as receipt of the product on time.</li>
    <li> I owned a Wahl rechargeable electric razor, and have enjoyed using it for several years.  It finally gave up the ghost.  When looking for new razor, I wanted another Wahl razor.  I saw this one on sale, and said I&#x27;ll go for it.  I have not been disappointed.  It has actually exceeded my expectations.  It shaves closer and more consistently than the previous Wahl I had.  I use it everyday.  Thanks Wahl</li>
    <li> You can buy this shaver with confidence. It runs smoothly and gives a really nice close shave. The trimmer works quite well also.    I have used about every type of electric shaver and at all price points. It is remarkable how well this shaver works and with a very reasonable price. The replacement foil and blades are also very inexpensive when compared to the other brands.     I hope this helps. Have a nice day!</li>
    <li> So far it has been the most comfortable and closest electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned.  Kinda loud, but it serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> It is the   cleanest shaving electric  I have owned.  Charge last a very long time.  I am very satisfied with this product and would recommend it as good buy to anyone.  I like the fact that it was manufactured in the states.</li>
    <li> My husband used this and it didn&#x27;t help him at all. He had several bumps under his chin after using this. I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Very nice I purchased the shaver for my dad and he loves it, looks exactly what it looks like and when he used it he loved it.</li>
    <li> It would not shave consistantly.  Bad buy.  Would never buy a shaver like this again.  Not worth the money at all</li>
    <li> If I could have given it a lower rating I would have.  It&#x27;s like holding a cheap piece of plastic (which it is). To advertise it at a price of almost $80 and show it at supposedly half price is ridiculous!  It&#x27;s not even worth the $45 it&#x27;s being sold for.  Would NEVER buy another Wahl product it this is how they are being made now.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as I expected - no, it didn&#x27;t work at all. For me this was a terrible product. I got a refund.</li>
    <li> Really shaves close !!!! Only con is its a bit noisey. Sure was priced right and fits nicely in the hand.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good, clean shave&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Good battery life&lt;br /&gt;Pop up trimmer&lt;br /&gt;Compact&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very loud&lt;br /&gt;Plastic casing feels kind of cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned. It cuts nice and close, but, in turn, buzzes real good. If you hold it just right it doesn&#x27;t rattle, but the compact design doesn&#x27;t do itself many favors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> used twice, irritate more than a wet shave, it&#x27;s a noisey shaver, not a close shaver need to go back to wet shave want be using it again</li>
    <li> Best damn shaver for the money, - I would not consider another shaver, unless this one was no longer produced.</li>
    <li> So, I bought this because my last Wahl shaver finally bit the dust. I&#x27;ve been using wall shavers for over 20 years now ever since Paul Harvey was selling them and I decided to give one a try. I have tried other brands but the changeable foil heads for different shaves keep me coming back because I just haven&#x27;t found a shaver that works better for me than the Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;I also went back to this style of the Wahl shaver because it can be rebuilt more easily than the styled body version. My first shaver lasted a long time because I could replace the battery when it quit holding a charge along with the foil heads a cutting bar.&lt;br /&gt;YES, this is a LOUD shaver! I&#x27;m not going to say the other reviewers aren&#x27;t wrong about that, but at about half the price on Amazon then many of the newer styles of shavers, but with a system that works better than those (to me), I recommend it!</li>
    <li> It did not cut my hair. I got it thinking I could use it on sensitive areas but it did not cut hair. It made me fill like its not meant to cut hair.</li>
    <li> Great transaction. Product works great with heavy beards. Portable with good battery life. A must have for the man on the go.</li>
    <li> sorry i&#x27;ve bought the new one an the pullout trimmer on it&lt;br /&gt;broken.&lt;br /&gt;it pulled out and never went in back&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you!</li>
    <li> I do not use any other kind of shaver I have used this all my life I would buy it again</li>
    <li> It is an amazing machine! I love it! I recommend this to everyone. It is very reliable and it&#x27;s a great price</li>
    <li> I was looking for something other than a razor to shave my head with and I stumbled upon this. I use it along with a pre-shave solution called \\&quot;Lectric Shave\\&quot; [[ASIN:B000R99ZUK Lectric Shave Lotion Regular - 7 Oz with green tea]] Cuts as close as a razor without the irritation! There are two reasons why I did not give it 5 stars. First reason is that it is very, very loud! I have to make sure all the doors to the rooms are closed when I start using it lol. The other reason is that it does not work on my face for some reason. It does a great job on my head but takes nothing off my face. It holds a decent charge, but you can plug it into an outlet and use it that way too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this if you are looking for an alternative to a razor when it comes to shaving your head.</li>
    <li> before i bought this shaver i read the reviews and i saw that people were complaining that it doesnt cut hair at all, so i asked my barber about it and he told me that it only cuts stubble. If you have facial hair that you want to keep it wont cut it, the shaver will only cut the stubble growing around your facial hair style. this shaver also comes with a clipper on the back that you can line your self up.  i didnt see anyone who wrote a review mention that so i was pleasently surprised.</li>
    <li> best shaver i have ever bought it does exactly what it claims to do, clean and precise shave with no bumps really happy with it</li>
    <li> This is supposed to give a close and non iritating shave. Instead it was not a close shave at all and it iritated me worse than any razor I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Great razor!  Does the job nicely and never have any problems with it.  Way better than the junky women&#x27;s razors out there.</li>
    <li> I love this razor!  I have a smooth face with a heavy beard, and it works great! I threw away&lt;br /&gt;my old razor and 12 dollars for five blades.Razor will pay for itself by saving me all this money.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy, and I hate to shave. My barber was using it on me. He said they sell for 55 bucks,&lt;br /&gt;but I found it on Amazon for only 35!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work! was hoping for a solution Ive been using magic shave for all my shaving life, was hoping this would be something that would work for me, but it did not .</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s barber uses this on him. He loves the way it leaves his face so much I had to get him one for Christmas!</li>
    <li> works very well saves me time and money I can shave my self and get a real nice look oppose to going to the barber and letting him do it for me</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always checking - is it as smooth as a razor shave?  Close enough for me to satisfy without the cuts and mess.  I&#x27;ve been using for 6 month now and like the power, battery life and nothing to complain about this!  Maybe time to replace the head because I&#x27;m taking a little more time to have but the replacements are reasonable - $15 if I recall correctly.</li>
    <li> This is my first ever customer review. I usually do not write reviews no matter how I felt about a product but felt compelled to write one this time for every African American male in my situation. Shaving for African Americans can be a very humbling and terrifying experience. It is something that can either make or break our self esteem. I am 24 years old and started going to the barbershop for a weekly shape up my sophomore year in high School. From the age of 15 - 24 I regularly used Andy&#x27;s Clippers to trim my face. This is because every time I would attempt to use a razor after a couple of days my face would be badly inflamed on the cheeks and neck area. Well July of 2013 I decided using the trimmers every morning for twenty minutes was taking too long and decided to try a razor one last time. Once again no luck with the razor just inflammation. Searching for an solution to my shaving problem I decided to buy this product. After my last razor shave, by the way I was using expensive Fusion razors, I waited 4 days for my face to heal. Once my face healed I started using the Wahl bump free shaver. I can gladly say now I only have about 2 maybe 3 bumps under my neck that are hardly visible. My cheeks and neck look like I don&#x27;t even use a razor. In other words my face looks like it did in High School. I must say I have only been using this product for a week now but am very satisfied. There is only one down fall for me. The shaver does not catch all areas leaving strands of hair here and there. But the tweezers take care of those few strands. But that is okay. The instructions say it can take up to a month to condition the skin for optimal results. Even if my results stay the same I would say I am very pleased with this product and recommend it to all African Americans with unwanted facial hair. I wake up in the morning and use this product for about a minute. Then I do it again before I go to sleep or out on the time. The product is simply amazing.</li>
    <li> This was my first time buying a product from Amazon online. I was pleased with the service that I received. I was also pleased with the product I purchased. It was given as a gift and it was well received. It worked just the way that product should have worked.    Thank you</li>
    <li> This shaver works as advertised. I use it on my head and on the back of my neck. It shaves clean and no razor bumps thus far.</li>
    <li> The top Shaver does not shave my hair, but the pop-out clipper is awesome and does the same job so for the price its a great deal.</li>
    <li> best electric shaver  iv&#x27;e used since i owned a sunbeam  that&#x27;s been over 40 yrs ago.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd consecutive one. I have been using it since it was intrduced by&amp;#34; Paul Harvey-?&amp;#34; I believe it was.&lt;br /&gt;It is the only electric shaver that ever worked for me. I like the super close.&lt;br /&gt;My 1st and 2nd finally broke the flexible membrane that oscillated the cutter head,  after many years service.&lt;br /&gt;I turned 90 this month. I expect this one will see me through.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely, Edsel R. Hensley</li>
    <li> We got shaver and the mini shaver hardly worked with a battery so we sent it back. Did not test the shaver itself</li>
    <li> Performs as expected.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave close as I thought it should. I had to return it after one shave due to the scene had a whole in it and cut my skin.</li>
    <li> This Shaver is the greatest my Son just loves the Wahl 7060 it is Bump-Free and Rechargeable cord and it&#x27;s Cordless it stays charged a long time it has not been charged but once since I purchased it..  I should have purchased two so I can make sure I have one later on at these prices you cannot beat it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for approixmately one month now and I have to admit that the wahl bump free shaver has exceeded my expectations. This shaver is not meant to replace your liners/clippers. It is more so an additional to your grooming collection. With this shaver, I am able to get a much closer shave by using it after my initial run through with my clippers. With my skin I knew that no shaver would totally be bump free, however I did not notice any additional bumps that are created via my clippers. I think I need to try using this product more between haircuts to see if the number of bumps on my neck reduces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to purchasing the wahl bump free shaver I read several reviews and noticed that a lot of people were discrediting the quality of the product. The plastic part of the shaver does seem a bit low in quality however the actual shaver works great. For personal use I would definitely reccommend this product. However, I cannot comment whether or not this would be a good long lasting shaver for a professional barber.</li>
    <li> I HAVE ONLY HAD THIS SHAVER A SHORT TIME, BUT SO FAR, IT FAR OUT PERFORMS MY OLD REMINGTON AND MY GERMAN RAZOR - THE BATTERY HAS GOOD STORAGE CAPACITY. I HAD ANOTHER WAHL LONG AGO AND THIS ONE IS EVEN BETTER. INTERESTING THAT FEW TO NO STORES IN OUR EAST TENN. AREA STOCK THIS RAZOR.</li>
    <li> Perfect for someone who can&#x27;t use a razor but don&#x27;t like a sandpaper face! Love Wahls product &amp; customer service! I never get of the phone unsatisfied.</li>
    <li> First let me say what I do and don&#x27;t want in a shaver.  By far the most important thing to me is close, fast, and comfortable shave.  Totally unimportant to me is how it looks.  I am not interested in impressing myself with how ex pensive my shaver looks when I shave.  Shaving is not a pleasure, but a chore I want to finish as quickly as possible.  I realize that not everyone has the same complexion or beard as me.  My complexion is fair and my beard is average but runs in every direction.  This shaver gives me the fastest, closest, and most comfortable shave I have ever had in my life.  I have used about every brand and type of shaver on the market in the last 50 years.  From blades to rotary  to foil , this one beats them all hollow.  Ad the very reasonable price, and the very important fact that it is made in America and that makes it the best deal out there today.  If you buy one I hope you are as pleased with your purchase as I am with mine.  On the other hand, if a lot of people watch you shave in the morning and you are more interested in impressing them with how expensive your foreign shaver looks than you are with getting the best shave of your life, you may not be interested in this shaver.  Wall has made a simple elegant design that is about shaving not impressive looks.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product because it does not create razor bumps. It shaves very close and any remaining hairs are cut with a razor. Again, I am pleased with the product. The product arrive within its prescribed dates.</li>
    <li> No bumps occurred after shaving but the shaver does not cut close as I thought it would.  Overall, a quiet shaver.</li>
    <li> Upon trying the new shaver, the motor sounded like it was struggling...not a smooth purr. The pop up shaver (very important to me) kept collapsing into its storage position. It would not stay extended without holding it in the extended position...very awkward. I called Wahl and complained. They said return it and they would send a new one. I have received the new one and it functions no better than the original. Guess I&#x27;ll have to live with it. My first Wahl shaver lasted over 20 years and it was the best. Guess they don&#x27;t make &#x27;em like they used to.</li>
    <li> This shaver does an outstanding job of what it does, but it definitely has limits.&lt;br /&gt;if you shave everyday or close to it, this might be for you. if you let your hair or beard or whatever grow jus a little it becomes far less effective and will probably need to be shaved with clippers first. This is a loud shaver but I am the last to wake up so I don&#x27;t care about that, It is easy to handle and shaves as close as a razor without all the razor related issues.&lt;br /&gt;IF the hair to be cut is very short this may do it in one pass, otherwise it will take several, but results are always excellent. Cleaning is a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;This uses old school NiCad orr whatever batteries so if you leave it on the charger 24/7 it will not last very long. per instructions, charge 12-18 hrs then leave unplugged and use until ready for recharge. I use mine 4 times a week and charge it once per week.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not bald because I want to be, but this makes it easier.</li>
    <li> The razor doews not give a close shave.  I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard and this thing does not cut my whiskers. One should  try before buying</li>
    <li> Have had several Wahls before.  This one seems noisier.  The slide for the trimmer is so stiff I have trouble opening it.  The shaver slide is a little stiff, too.  However, the battery seems very good.  One charge lasted through many shaves.</li>
    <li> I was excited to use product. And very disappointed!!!! NO CLOSE SHAVE! Not what so ever!!!! Send back to Wahl for refund!!</li>
    <li> Overall a decent product, I say that because I still get some irritation, but not as much as I did when I used disposable razors and diploratories. I just ordered this shaver last month and I am satisfied. I use the Wahl bump free trimmer in conjuction with the Wahl bump free super close shaver and it seems to be a good combination. I don&#x27;t use any after shave or bump control products.....I think these may have added more irritation than anything, so I use hydrogen paroxide instead, and I get better results.  I shave every 2 days while using the bump free trimmer in between getting a closer shave with the bump free shaver.  I suggest reading the instructions and figuring out your technique.   I would recommend this product, and I plan on purchasing one for travel.</li>
    <li> I want to share my great experience with this product for the benefit of others who have struggled for years like I have with painful and unsightly bumps from ingrown hairs.  I am a Black man who had always struggled with shaving. I have very course and very curly facial hair. For years, I used the Wahl trimmers to shave, but I could never get skin-close. This became a more critical issue when I became an attorney and began working in an environment that demanded the clean-shaven look.   Over the past 20 years, I tried just about everything: special razors, depilatories, special skin pre-shave and aftershave lotions and treatments, etc., but nothing worked. Years ago, I tried the Remington shaver for Black men, but it gave me just as many shaving bumps as anything else. Simply put, a close shave always meant bumps, no matter what, and I had to settle for the trimmers that gave me a shave that looked like I hadn&#x27;t shaved for at least a day.     I came across the Wahl Bump-Free shaver, and decided to order it and try it after reading the reviews and customer ratings. When I first used it, I was very skeptical when I felt how closely it shaved. My face was absolutely smooth with no stubble, so I knew I was going to have horrible bumps. After about a week of use, a had a few bumps on my upper cheeks, but NOTHING like before.  In about the second week of use, however, my neck and lower chin broke out with horrible bumps that were definitely caused by ingrown hairs. I was about to give up on the shaver when my girlfriend pointed out that my bumps looked more inflamed after I used my cocoa butter-based skin therapy oil. (I was using this oil to help heal the scars I had on my face from years of shaving bumps and abuse.) I immediately washed the product off my face, and almost immediately, the bumps started going down. Eventually, I got rid of the ingrown hairs, and after I stopped using the skin therapy oil, I stopped getting those bumps.  When I first started, the shaverdid miss a lot of whiskers. The directions said to give it a few weeks to let your skin and hair get used to the shaver. I did not know how that worked, but sure enough, the more I used it, the fewer whiskers it left behind. Also, the problem areas I had on my upper cheeks are no longer problems at all.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, and overall it works great! I have one or two bumps right now, but this is the same as I got using the Wahl trimmers and far better than the 20-30 bumps I&#x27;d have with anything else that shaved this close. After I shave, my face is perfectly smooth with no stubble. I occasionally use the trimmer to get hairs left over on the lower neck, but that&#x27;s it. I have no idea how it can get so close with no bumps, but it does.  I begin my shaving routine each morning by washing my face with a face brush for 1-2 minutes. I dry my face, put on a pre-electric shaving lotion, then use the shaver. After I shave, I wash my face with cooler water, apply an anti-shaving bump lotion, like Bump Stopper, then apply a moisturizing face lotion. At night before bed, I wash again with the face brush, apply Bump Stopper, and then a face lotion.  DRAWBACKS: The shaver is LOUD. I can wake my girlfriend up with it in the morning if she&#x27;s still sleep! Also, I had to be patient. It took a while for my skin to get used to the shaver and start catching all the whiskers, but it eventually did. If my hair is too long, then it won&#x27;t work --- (particularly because my hair is so tightly curled), so I can&#x27;t go a week without shaving and then expect to whip this thing out and get the same optimal shave as other times (which is also true for just about any screen shaver I&#x27;ve experienced anyway). Finally, I&#x27;ve learned that a cocoa butter-based product will give me bumps with this shaver. I never had problems with cocoa butter before, but I do with this shaver for some reason. But overall, in my opinion, these are small inconveniences to endure considering the GREAT shaving experience I finally have. Even with these drawbacks, today I am so happy with my shaving experience that I give this shaver FIVE stars!</li>
    <li> Awesome shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Cuts real close and good battery life.</li>
    <li> This was a big step for me , for many years I&#x27;ve been using clippers to shave but after using it I can now shave the stubble also...lol Great Product about to order replacement blades so they don&#x27;t disappear...</li>
    <li> Great product works just like it&#x27;s described !!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver to compliment the Andis Styleliners II. After reaching the age of being able to get facial hair and when it became more prominent, my barber would always style/shape-up first, then clean up with the Wahl Bump Free Shaver. It always left an invigorating clean and soft feeling. The process of using and cleaning this tool is pretty straight forward. One foreseeable problem that might incur, would be where would be the best place to by replacement blade(s) after 3-4 months use. This tool does do enough of the job by reaching small the small hairs. The hard to get place I have noticed is under the chin and around the neck area. In my situation the best way to have a clean and spotless neck is have the barber use the straight blade at the shop. Overall, I think this purchase is/will be a good investment with its multi-functional ability, compact size, and ease of use. I highly recommend this cutting tool.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great shaver.  It gets your face: super smooth.&lt;br /&gt;The attached trimmer/edger: cuts very good: as well.&lt;br /&gt;And: I can get several shaves: between charges: even though: it&#x27;s cordless.&lt;br /&gt;The negative:&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this shaver 5 stars easily: but this thing is so darn noisy: and the trimmer: has to be held: very firm: while in use: because it doesn&#x27;t have a locking feature on it.  Very minor issues: but over all: it&#x27;s a very good shaver.</li>
    <li> The wahl shever is good so mach it is not have a bump and it has a pawor save  I say tank you very mach</li>
    <li> This shaver failed to perform. Period!  I gave it away shortly after I purchased it. I couldn&#x27;t get a close enough shave without shaving for at least an hour, and the with makes it kinda hard to handle, and he trimmer was useless. I bought the Panasonic ES8103S as a replacement and I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful American made product! I bought this for my husband because his other one stopped working and he wanted one that was Made in USA. This is a very well made product.</li>
    <li> I was determined to buy a shaver made in the USA.  This one seemed to be a good possibility.  It does shave really close but is hard to use on the neck without lots of nicks.  If you try to use it on a two or three day beard, it pulls the skin and misses some individual hairs.  It was advertised as including a clipper, which I assumed was attached.  It was not.  It was a separate unit requiring batteries.  The main problems for me is the noise (very loud) and the constant need to replace the screen (cutter bar assembly).  The screen falls apart after about two months of normal use, producing sharp edges which cut the skin.  So you have to keep buying new cutter bar assemblies at about $10 - $20 each time.  I am used to the Norelco rotary shavers which last for years without any attention.  They are very quiet, effecient, and sturdy compared to the Wahl.  I plan to buy another Norelco very soon!</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s more it&#x27;s turbo speed! And still delivers closest shaves!</li>
    <li> to be anticipated I suppose coming from a USA source but it would be nice to be forewarned that the shaver cannot be recharged without a 110 volt outlet, or transformer.  Fortunately I could cope.  Shaver itself is marvellous, best shave ever after years of experience with likes of Braun, Remington, Panasonic etc.  Noisy and vibratory but perfprms well.  Pity its not a dual voltage model.&lt;br /&gt;Wish there was a UK supplier.</li>
    <li> The shaver blades are great, nice close shave and easy to clean.  But if you are buying it because it has a trimmer, don&#x27;t!  The trimmer blades are either not sharpened or don&#x27;t meet correctly - it&#x27;s like using a butter knife to trim my beard, only worse!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t give a clean smooth shave and it&#x27;s a waste of money with the loud noise that it makes.</li>
    <li> Like the fact that is gives a clean shave. options of using the cord on or off.</li>
    <li> I have used a Remington Black Men&#x27;s Electric Shaver for over 5 years with great results.  The only problem is they don&#x27;t make it anymore as far as I can tell and my current one has a nick in the screen that scratches my face.  So I tried this bump free Wahl.  It basically did not do as advertised.  It was supposed to trim the whiskers above the surface so that they don&#x27;t curl back in under the skin like lift and cut or close shave razors do.  This Wahl basically took off a top layer of skin and lifted pulled and chewed out most of my whiskers while just laying some down without cutting them at all.    I&#x27;ve decided to go to the disposable type black men&#x27;s bump control razor I can get at Walmart.  While it takes me a little longer to shave than electric, it is doing the type of job my old Remington did.    Hope this helps.  If you want bump control for curly facial hair, DO NOT BUY THIS!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor for my rather picky father for Christmas. Since he is a pilot, he needed one that would hold it&#x27;s charge and was not bulky so he could pack it in his travel bag.  He had a Wahl for a very long time, and when it putzed out, I looked online for a new one.  He says this is even better than the last one! He uses it for his face, but the box shows a picture of a young man who has used it to shave his head. Overall, a pretty good buy for the money, I think!</li>
    <li> Good product, apparently did not work well for my husband.</li>
    <li> hubby loves it would buy again. Thanks for having this price was very reasonable. Have one very happy hubby thanks</li>
    <li> I use this at work and no complaints  would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> If you can&#x27;t think of something to give your male friend or companion, etc. This is a great gift for the price.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a good product for a long time and to my surprise this has worked very well.  The only downside is that it is very rough and at times irritates my skin in certain spots.  The trick is to trim the hair down to a stubble when necessary.  Overall it gets the job done, and for the first time in 15 years I can shave daily without any problems and with a very close shave.</li>
    <li> I have been using these razors for many years.  Can&#x27;t beat them for the price. My only complaint is that they come only with the super close screen. Up until a few years ago, they also came with a sensitive and close screen. The super close screen can be hard on some skin types, or on a young man just starting to shave.</li>
    <li> This shaver has given the closest shave that any electric shaver has ever.  I can not use the shaver daily because of the ingrown hair problem.  With the proper post shave facial care I do get a bump free shave.  I no longer have to go to a barber for a really good shave with this shaver.</li>
    <li> Ok to beign with let me explain my skin and hair type. Im mixed black and white,I happen to have very light skin and very curly hair.I ahve pure african hair,not the kind of mixed hair you can think of.&lt;br /&gt;Ive tried everyproduct,after shave,razor and I bought this cause teh Whal clipper is one of the best products outthere adn does help on mantaining a moderately bump free apereance.But we all know its not a clean shaven look.&lt;br /&gt;So the promise of this shaver bump free close shave was very tentative. The first shave you feel awesome,bump free.But the next days bring the usual bumps you get when you shave with a razor against the grain.Maybe a bit less but definately not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;If you ahve a very special ocasion like a wedding you may use it but be ready to let your beard grow for weeks to heal your skin afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Don waste your money the way I did.&lt;br /&gt;Buy the Whal clipper for everyday use and shave with a regular razor on special ocasions,always going back to the whal clipper.&lt;br /&gt;Along with the clipper its a good final touch,but not bump free in my case.It may work for moderate cases,I guess all those 4 and 5 star reviews may be true. Not for me thoug</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t give the close shave it advertises. The foil that came with it didn&#x27;t even last a whole month. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> My cousin is undergoing Brest Cancer treatments and I shaved my head to help show my support for her fight. This razor did all that was required it gives me a nice smoothly saved head without razor burns or bumps, the sideburn trimmer works really well to shorten the hair so that the razor can do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this razor for both the head and the face.</li>
    <li> The electric shaver meets all expectations.  Great shave.  Easy to use and charging and clean-up is effortless.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> Hello, I am 39 years old and have been shaving for over 23 years.  I am black man and have tried every shaving method out there and always had some type of razor bumps.  I had to settle with using clippers to shave, but they only cut so close and I still got razor bumps from it.  Fortunately, I stumbled onto this product a month ago and was very skeptical.  My item shipped quickly.  Upon my first shave I was newvous and expected to see razor bumps the next day.  Well it&#x27;s been over 30 days and not one single razor bump.  I am available to even go against the grain with this product which is usually a &amp;#34;No No&amp;#34;.  I have finally been able to get a good, clean, close shave with no razor bumps.  I am rubbing my smooth skin as I type this in misbelief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Wahl for making this product!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t catch my stubble like an  outliner which is a shame tried growing beard and still barely clipped anything it nicked my Adam&#x27;s apple but no bump and the scab was pretty some hence the 1 star as opposed to no review at all</li>
    <li> great product, Perfect!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son for Christmas because his barber swears by it when servicing his clients. He liked it so much I bought this one for my husband.  My husband raves about the ease of use, he can take it anywhere and he loves the close shave.</li>
    <li> My husband has used this razor for years and has never had a different kind of electric razor. Wahl is a very dependable company</li>
    <li> This is the second Wahl shaver that I have owned. The motor speed is very fast. It is comfortable to use. The charging time is fast and the battery power is dependable. You can&#x27;t beat the value for the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this when I did. Exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> I get razor bumps but not with this machine. I was glad that it helped out. I can&#x27;t use blade razors so this was perfect.</li>
    <li> This shaver was for my husband.  It was returned because it did not live up to what it&#x27;s advertised as.</li>
    <li> Nice product, nice clean shave without bumping up.</li>
    <li> Works great for close shave, but it&#x27;s real noisy.</li>
    <li> This is very great shaver that gets just as close as razor</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my husband who has a heavy beard.  This has given him the closest shave that he&lt;br /&gt;has ever had with an electric shaver!  It is definitely bump-free.</li>
    <li> It was nice while it lasted. It got as close as a shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten without causing hair bumps and ingrown hairs, but after leaving it uncharged for a month, it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore. I&#x27;m going to get it replaced, but that&#x27;s always a hassle.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t order this item, although I do use one just like it.</li>
    <li> It fits but I thought it  would be black. I&#x27;m using it</li>
    <li> I decided to &amp;#34;go bald&amp;#34; about a year ago.  Recently, I went to a new barber shop and the guy used the clippers with no guard on my head, then he used this exact Super Close electric shaver from Wahl all over my head for a really impressive shave.  I was so impressed I went out and bought it on my own from Amazon and have been using this ever since.  It&#x27;s the exact same model he used on me that day.  No more barber visits for me, as I can get the same super close shave right at home.  If you are thinking of sporting the bald look or know someone who is, this electric shaver is awesome.  It truely does give you a super close bald head shave, with no nicks.  I generally use it once every 1 to 2 days and it works for me.  Best of luck fellow bald guys or &amp;#34;soon to be&amp;#34; bald guys!</li>
    <li> Great shaver, works well, smooth finish. Still had bumps. I still recommend this product with high regards. Try it for yourself.</li>
    <li> I purchased this rechargeable shaver because I couldn&#x27;t find much else available anywhere. My dad likes the Wahl brand and has owned several models over time.  But then this brand disappeared from all the places he usually buy it from and I had to search for one. I found this one for him and bought it.  It is not a very fancy one and is a lower grade model than he has ever purchased in this brand.  The casing is just plastic and it feels cheap.  But it is dong the job and doing it well.  It is the best I was able to find and I hope it lasts.</li>
    <li> I have used WAHL shavers for many years. When my old one needed to be replaced, I bought this model. It tried to PULL my whiskers out. Very painful. The switch was also very hard to turn on and off. I returned it to Amazon for a full refund.</li>
    <li> This razor is the solution to my razor bump problem.  I&#x27;ve been bump free ever since I&#x27;ve been using this razor.  Only hard part is buying the replacement parts and waiting for them since you can&#x27;t buy them at the store, but I&#x27;ll do it for the purpose of not getting razor bumps again.</li>
    <li> This is truly a good product; it gives a comfortable shave and does an exceptionally good job in not breaking the skin. I could tell this from the first time I applied after shave--the second time, I used moisturizer and neither burned or irritated. I recommend this shaver for anyone moving from razor to electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Extremely close shaver.</li>
    <li> Oh yeah my guys can&#x27;t get enough of this. Smooth and no bumps when shaving the facial skin area. It was what they expected.</li>
    <li> Love my black shaver!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t often post reviews. But this is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had problems with electric shavers. The rotary ones don&#x27;t work at all for me. I had a Remington MS280 that worked well for years, although I had to go over my face many, many times to get it smooth. When it finally died, the replacement Remington was even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wahl shaves me smooth in under 2 minutes. It even works on the rough hairs on the back of my neck. I used to have to use a regular razor for those. I always kept my shaver in the car and shaved on the 10 minute drive from my home to the highway. Now I&#x27;m done before I leave the driveway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have said that it vibrates heavily, it&#x27;s noisy, and the trimmer edge seems flimsy. There does seem to be a bit of truth in those complaints. But frankly I&#x27;ve never had to conceal my shaving, and the trimmer does it&#x27;s job well enough. I just want to get a very close shave quickly, and this product gets 5 stars for that.</li>
    <li> i never received mine UPS lost it. i filed a claim and now they are talking to amazon about replacing it. so until i get it i honestly cannot give a good review.</li>
    <li> I had purchased one prior to this one and loved it. I lost it and purchased another. The hair trimmer doesn&#x27;t stay fully engaged and doesn&#x27;t function properly</li>
    <li> Just jumping right to it...This product did not work well for me because my hair lies flat to my face. I am an African American and because of the way my hair curls stuble lies very flat to my cheeks, chin, and neck. This razor did not cut most of my hair for that reason and left my face scruffy in most spots no matter how hard I pulled and tugged. I would recommend you examine your hair growth before purchase. If your hair lies flat to your face please be wary of purchasing this item. If it does not then I&#x27;m sure this item would work great for you.</li>
    <li> my associate did not like this one. he said it made him itch. he is looking for something else. service with the seller was great the item was brand new. it was just not good for him. it is probably an excellent product so i don&#x27;t want to rate it bad based on my associates chimerical skin issues.</li>
    <li> I use this machine everyday. Works perfect, although battery does not last too long, but you can still use it while its charging which is good. I would buy this product again in a heart beat!</li>
    <li> This shaver was recommended to me by my barber about 12 years ago.  It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve used since then and I love it.</li>
    <li> I picked this up due to the fantastic experience I had with Wahl clippers. This shaver ended up being a bust however. I ended up spending over an hour trying to shave a four day old beard. It left patches everywhere, did nothing to the grey hairs in my beard which I&#x27;ve learned tends to be tougher than regular hair. I ended  up getting shaving bumps all over my neck. Not anywhere near when I used a razor but still copious. Glad I tested it weeks before my wedding otherwise that would  have been a sorry situation. To anyone that gets shaving bumps from everything, go back to your clippers. Clippers might not shave as close as we&#x27;d like, but they don&#x27;t give any bumps.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver at my son&#x27;s request as he had enjoyed using it in the past.  Unfortunately, after only a few days the shaver broke.  Even more unfortunately, he threw it away and so we were unable to return it for a credit.</li>
    <li> Husband loved the wahl 7060-700 bump free shaver, thanks again for your Business.</li>
    <li> This shaver is virtually the same Wahl shaver that I&#x27;ve used many years. It died though, won&#x27;t charge anymore. I was so pleased with my old one, I got a new one. Only difference is the gold foil. Follow the instructions and it should result in a close comfortable shave. It does for me!</li>
    <li> does what it is advertised to do and nothing else...cheaper than others and works the same....have had no issues with any of the devices inputs/switches or functions...my wife is a hair stylist and she bought these.....have not heard any complaints</li>
    <li> It gives you a close, bump free shave. Only thing is that it&#x27;s more powerful when plugged in. Other than that it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband and he fell in love with it.</li>
    <li> It a good shaver to use.</li>
    <li> i cuts such as indicated very light comfortable to use long battery life i charge once a month and I use it twice a week&lt;br /&gt;I recommend</li>
    <li> Did not work at all!!  Money down the drain.  Beard was alittle long so I shaved with clippers, next couple days tried the Wahl shaver was very disappointed.  Tried for a week straight and it did nothing for me.  Back to the clippers I go.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver in hopes of a quick, easy, and convenient way to shave my face and head nice and smooth...it doesn&#x27;t work, it doesn&#x27;t shave the hair at all.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. I bought it for my boyfriend who has a very sensitive neck. He tends to break out when he shaves because it becomes so irritated. I read the reviews and thought this would be the perfect product for him. Although it may work for other men (not all men are the same, obviously), it wasn&#x27;t perfect for my boyfriend. He still has an irritated neck, although it does do less damage than a razor. The search continues!</li>
    <li> The  shaver works perfectly. The services was excellent. The first one was broken and I returned it.i got a replacement in three days.&lt;br /&gt;thanks very much.</li>
    <li> The foil top had a break in it right off the bat, very poor quality!</li>
    <li> I like this shaver... It&#x27;s what I was looking for. I use it every other day and gives me no rash/bumps on my face. I am white and average facial hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this model shaver for years. This is my fourth one &amp; it performs as well as all the other ones in the past. Only problem areas were the charger cord breaking off &amp; the sideburn trimmer jamming.</li>
    <li> Love it. It is very loud but works like a charm. It took me a while to get the technique down. I use lectra shave so it runs smooth on my skin. I use the edger first and then follow it with the trimmer. I make sure not to push down hard. If you do, you will get bumps. And I make sure to rinse afterwards. Followed with some Wheat Germ Oil to heal the scars.</li>
    <li> Still maybe a little too early to make a complete review. But it works well enough right out of the box. I believe that my skin will take a little time to get use to it. Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I would have liked...yet.</li>
    <li> &amp;lt;h1&gt;After reading reviews from people challenged with proper tools for a nice clean shave, I found this product.&amp;lt;/h1&gt; It becomes difficult to use it as an every-few-days shaver. Everyday use on AA skin is harsh. It is best used after a trimmer because the foil-shaver can only cut very short hairs. Longer hairs are difficult for the Wahl to cut, so it may become a spotty shaver.  So it has become a secondary shaver for me after using my trimmer first to get hairs shorter, the Wahl will give you a close shave but do not use it as your primary shaver when whiskers are beyond stubble.</li>
    <li> This is the only electric shaver I know about that can be used with or without a cord, which I love because I shave my legs and my electric shaver&#x27;s batteries always died halfway. I was looking for a shaver like this for months! I am a girl, and this one is for guys but what matters is that it works great ;). It says that it bump-free but I do get a few bumps here and there.</li>
    <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong with this razor. this is a quick smooth shave. the only thing is your hair must be low for it to work. i use it all over my body and it works great.</li>
    <li> As an African American with course hair and tough skin, shaving bumps have always been a fact of life.&lt;br /&gt;Having determined early on that electric shavers work best for me, I&#x27;ve been through them all over the last 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;This Wahl Bump-Free Shaver last month, the condition of my facial skin has changed dramatically for the better.&lt;br /&gt;While a little loud and awkwardly shaped, I get the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced while applying minimal pressure.&lt;br /&gt;My wife still comments on how smooth my face is at the end of the day and I&#x27;m down to ONE bump!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also pleased to notice that the corner beauty supply store actually carried the replacement cutters and screen, which means no hassle when the time comes to change them.</li>
    <li> I like Wahl products so trying this out was not a stretch. A friend turned me on to trying a \\&quot;foil\\&quot; shaver for a change so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Having owned this shaver for about a year now, I think I can give about as an objective review as any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a powerful little thing. I really got a sense that it could cut through just about anything, it has that \\&quot;barber shop\\&quot; style buzzing noise to it. As many others have said, this is a _loud_ little shaver. --This cannot be overstated. If you&#x27;ve been in a barber shop when they turn on a loud clipper, that&#x27;s about what it sounds like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for build quality, it&#x27;s quite solid and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to fall apart. The included AC charger is 120VAC only so a voltage converter will be necessary for overseas travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with a nice little cover for the shaver foil which fit nicely and a small brush but that&#x27;s it--no case or anything. This is definitely more utilitarian and down-to-business than other shavers on the market but I felt the price was quite reasonable (esp. for made in America).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the things I liked....&lt;br /&gt;a) AC power &#x3D; full throttle. This is a powerful little bugger, and will cut, and continue to cut well--almost too well (see below). If the battery is low, you can plug it in and go full throttle over your stubble.&lt;br /&gt;b) Small and very compact. --It&#x27;s really light, actually.&lt;br /&gt;c) Well made. It definitely has a feeling of \\&quot;quality\\&quot; to it.&lt;br /&gt;d) Reputable brand. Wahl makes pretty solid stuff, glad to see nothing has changed.&lt;br /&gt;e) Replacement parts are relatively inexpensive. I did some research on foils and it looks like you&#x27;re going to spend approximately $10-20 every six months for replacement foils. Replacement foils run about $10 or so; Foil &amp; cutter bar combo is around $15-$20&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things I think could&#x27;ve been better...&lt;br /&gt;a) Li-Ion battery vs. NiCad. This shaver takes up to 18 hours (according to the manual). Not fun but if you only shave once a day, it&#x27;s not a big deal. As the battery winds down, the shaver will slow down until.......zip. On the plus side, you can use it while plugged in, and go \\&quot;full throttle\\&quot; over your face.&lt;br /&gt;b) Clunky charger. I realize it&#x27;s a charger and not meant to be \\&quot;pretty\\&quot; but it&#x27;s a tad on the big side. On the plus side, Wahl gives you a generous amount of cord between the AC brick and the shaver itself--this is probably my favorite and only likable thing about the charger, you aren&#x27;t \\&quot;tethered\\&quot; to the wall with a small cord.&lt;br /&gt;c) The sideburn trimmer on the back does not lock in position. If you are just \\&quot;pulling\\&quot; away, it works fine but a gentle tap on the top may interrupt it. I found I had to hold it up with my thumb, and only \\&quot;pull\\&quot; hair away. On the plus side, it cuts like a Ginsu knife through your sideburns and beard hair--no problems there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things I didn&#x27;t like...&lt;br /&gt;a) The noise. Especially in the mornings. BZZZZZZZZ! I don&#x27;t mind it once in a while but after a few mornings, it gets old... I&#x27;ve gotten used to it but I think this could turn some people off. On the flip side, it takes much less time to shave with this than my rotary so it&#x27;s a trade-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Cleaning became a bit of a chore. With the rotary, I can just pop open the head and brush it out. The cutter bars need to be brushed out, as does the rest of the shaver. It takes time to do it right and you have to be careful with the cutter bars and foil. One thing I&#x27;ve noticed is the hair is so cut down that it&#x27;s almost like powder rather than pieces of hair when I clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice: More of a warning really: DO NOT PRESS AGAINST YOUR SKIN UNNECESSARILY, let it glide across your face and don&#x27;t press into or against your skin; if you don&#x27;t, you will get irritation, and it&#x27;s not fun. The more gently you let the razor rest against your skin, the better your shave will be. Also, it&#x27;s noted in the manual but worth mentioning that you will need to pull your skin a little up and away a little agains the grain if you want an even closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a great shaver.... Loud but very, very good at what it does.ll need to pull your skin a little up and away a little agains the grain if you want an even closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a great shaver.... Loud but very, very good at what it does.w much I stretched or rotated the shaving head against-the-grain. For my head, the Wahl rotary works perfect--close, but not too close--but I read that some people who have really course, thick beard stubble have better luck with foil shavers. I thought I should give it a try since it wasn&#x27;t $200+ like some of the other automatic shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the bump-free Wahl shaver because if it performed as well as the reviews were saying, I wouldn&#x27;t be disappointed. Amazon Prime had it here in less than 48 hours--a real surprise--and the shaver was here in all its glory. I followed the instructions and let it charge for approximately 18 hours before I turned it on. The following morning, I gave it a try before I took a shower. WOW--this thing is a little \\&quot;buzz bomb!\\&quot; You can really feel it clipping the hairs off your face. It&#x27;s a tad on the loud side but the consolation is you don&#x27;t have to use it for very long--it just \\&quot;mows\\&quot; through your beard without difficulty. The instructions do not give any real guidance on precise methods of shaving; it only tells you what \\&quot;not\\&quot; to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For instance, don&#x27;t press hard against your skin--it&#x27;ll make the blades hot and you&#x27;ll irritate your skin. I hold mine with the power switch facing me, and drag it down my neck until I go all the way around. Then, I flip it upside down with the power switch still facing me, and I drag it upwards to catch the hair that I missed on the down stroke. My mustache area and sideburns are quite easy, and it just glides over them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manual is certainly right about one thing--if you&#x27;re not used to using an electric shaver, go gently at first because your beard and skin has to get used to the vibrating blades. It&#x27;s easy to get carried away so I suggest putting on some Lubriderm or skin lotion on afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real convenience for me is now I shave before I get in the shower, not after. I know some people suggest that you should wash your face before shaving to soften your beard but in my case it really makes no difference; I shave dry and it comes off buttery smooth.  I clean it after every other shave with the included brush (now I use a clean but old toothbrush) to clean out the cutting bars. Cleaning really makes a difference, too... You can never really clean too often because it will collect all the hair, oils, and dead skin on your face in the cutting bars--clean them frequently and it will make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it takes you about 5min or so to shave every morning, the battery will last you probably 4-5 shaves easy. The motor will begin to whine down slowly so that means drag the razor slower over your face. The nice thing about being able to use it while it&#x27;s plugged in is even if the battery dies, you can continue shaving! :) It&#x27;s probably best to let the battery die every so often so it doesn&#x27;t build up a memory (the manual talks about this). I charge mine probably once or twice a week at most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, take my advice on this--make sure you do not press hard against the skin, you will really give yourself a rash. Remember to \\&quot;drag\\&quot; the razor up your face, not push--it&#x27;s a lot easier to shave this way and I find it works very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.9/5 stars (Noisy!)</li>
    <li> As a black man I&#x27;ve tried nearly all the types of shavine methods over the years and was not happy, until now. The Wahl shaver is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s very fast and efficient with a light touch. I think using the trimmer first may be a good idea, as this keeps the whiskers straighter. I haven&#x27;t tried this yer but I&#x27;m going to. My method is slightly different I shave my head and my face in a downward direction only first, and then use the Wahl to finish with. A smoother face you couldn&#x27;t ask for, without any irratation. I always use coco butter soap to wash my face with and a mild facial scrub at night with a coco butter moisturizer lotion before going to bed. Also spreading your skin between your fingers and thumb and shaving in between the fingers is very helpfull. This is an excellent razor for all if used properly, I would recomend it highly!</li>
