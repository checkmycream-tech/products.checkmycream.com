      <li>I have SUPER dry skin</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>/&gt;The mask does not harden, so it is more comfortable to wear than having a stiff heavy mask on your face.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>So far its been alright.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a mask that was 100% natural and tried this mask.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It also leaves my skin hydrated and soft.  </li>
      <li>you can buy here on Amazon or directly through the Innate Skin site.  </li>
      <li>The one provided is too short and can easy make a mess on the sides of the jar.</li>
      <li>oils left my skin feeling very soft but not at all</li>

      <li>The next morning, my skin is practically clear and the redness from scars is all that ultimately remains.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Wow! This mask is amazing. I love how it makes my skin feel &amp; it&#x27;s very easy to mix &amp; put on. You can definitely feel the vitamins working on your skin. I used to use aztec healing clay mask which was really rough on my skin &amp; I hated the tight feeling on my face. I will definitely be switching to this mask now. I love it!!!!! :)</li>
    <li> I have sensitive combination skin with at least a few blemishes always on my face. Most masks I&#x27;ve tried irritated my skin, made me break out, or just did nothing for me. When I first tried this, though I was hesitant since I&#x27;ve had such non-amazing experiences with masks in general, I immediately fell in love. The mask itself is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use this when I&#x27;m having really bad skin days by stirring it up, and massaging it onto my skin after a shower. I leave it on as long as possible (I believe the recommended time is 15-30 minutes) then rinse it off while massaging the remaining oils into my skin. The next morning, my skin is practically clear and the redness from scars is all that ultimately remains. THIS IS AMAZING TO ME! I absolutely LOVE this mask and rely on it to make my skin look and feel wonderful the next morning. I don&#x27;t use it every week, but I use it whenever I have big events, meeting important people, or just want to feel really good about my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been battling acne for about 15+ years now and never has my skin looked this good after using a product just once, let alone however often I choose to use it. I love this. If you have acne prone skin and have tried some masks that just irritate or break out your skin, definitely try this. I have also taken their Innate Skin Vitamin Packs and their nighttime oil and love those both as well. I feel like if you&#x27;re having any issues with your skin, definitely give any of their products a go because they have worked wonders. Definitely get this bad boy. SOOOOO worth it in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I honestly love this mud mask! It goes on so smoothly and doesn&#x27;t dry when it&#x27;s on my face which means there&#x27;s no itching or the urgent need to wash it off.  It also leaves my skin hydrated and soft.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Thank you for the good goods Skin thanks I became very sparkly love ^^ Thank you for now skin beauty thanks</li>
    <li> This vitamin infused mask makes my skin look and feel amazing.&lt;br /&gt;The mask is way too gritty. A good portion of the product falls into my sink as I rub it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer a smoother consistency with exfoliating beads added to it instead of this paste like consistency.</li>
    <li> I love the effects of this. I&#x27;ve been on the look out for a mask. It&#x27;s tricky to find something that&#x27;s natural and effective. Some mud masks can be a bit too drying. I have dry to normal skin so I don&#x27;t want something that&#x27;s stripping. While this does a great job at leaving my skin feel cleansed it also makes it feel smooth and hydrated. I feel like I&#x27;ve been to the spa and had a long professional facial after using this. Win.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this mask although I do agree with another reviewer on how weird it reacts to water, but once I figured that out it was super easy to apply and remove.  It leaves your skin feeling smoother and refreshed and only wish I had more time to use it :)</li>
    <li> This mud mask feels very luxorious.  It has a clean scent and feels overall like a high quality spa product.  I am new to using the mask, so I am not sure if it helps my acne, but I feel like it helped make some blemishes smaller.  It leaves me skin feeling very soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Innate Skin Vitamin Pack for my daughter and it worked so well for her that I started using it myself.  So when I saw that they had a Mud Mask I had to try.  I have been very pleased with the results.  I love that the mask does not dry out, but stays soft and nourishing.  My skin feels great after using it and looks much softer and radiant.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This mask definitely infuses my skin with a lot of essential oils and leaves it silky soft. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week so not sure if it helps with my acne yet. However, I will continue using it to see possible results. If I had to describe the texture, it would be gritty/sandy and thick but not gritty enough to give a deep exfoliation of the face. I found the mask hard to spread onto the skin because it was similar to egg whites in how it doesn&#x27;t adhere to the surface well and you find yourself forcing it to stick/spread. Applying with a dry face is the only way I could get it to spread so if your hands or face is wet, it crumbles up and falls off your face without sticking! Perhaps it&#x27;s the oil / water doesn&#x27;t mix combo. Overall, I do like how hydrated it leaves my skin and I really like the natural ingredients so I will keep using it until it runs out.</li>
    <li> After the busy new year, filled with traveling, I was finally able to sit down and try this mask! I have had nothing but nice things to say about this company and especially their customer service! And nothing has changed! So far this mask is a fun adventure! Goes on nicely and easily, washes off easily and what I like most about it is it&#x27;s not filled with a bunch of products I can&#x27;t pronounce or understand. Plus! Unlike other masks, this masks doesnt harden to that state where you can&#x27;t talk or even blink! It&#x27;s lightweight and has practically no odor! The only thing I recommend is to invest in a different nonmetallic spoon for stirring the jar. The plastic one is not strong enough or long enough to give you that security you need when stirring. The one provided is too short and can easy make a mess on the sides of the jar. Look forward to trying this a few more times to see the full effects! Keep ya posted!</li>
    <li> I have naturally dry skin that was looking tired and dull. I was looking for a mask that was 100% natural and tried this mask.&lt;br /&gt;I really liked it for several reasons.&lt;br /&gt;The clay has a very fine grain that exfoliates very gently. It does not feel rough or gritty.&lt;br /&gt;The oils left my skin feeling very soft but not at all oily.&lt;br /&gt;The mask does not harden, so it is more comfortable to wear than having a stiff heavy mask on your face.&lt;br /&gt;When I washed it off, my skin felt polished and rejuvenated.</li>
    <li> This vitamin infused mask makes my skin look and feel amazing, but I feel like the price is way too steep for what it is. The mask is way too gritty. A good portion of the product falls into my sink as I rub it on my face. I prefer a smoother consistency with exfoliating beads added to it instead of this paste like consistency.</li>
    <li> Other masks have made my skin turn red as if I was sunburned. This innate skin mask not only exfoliates and moisturizers, it doesn&#x27;t feel oily or dry. I have tried it for just 15 minutes and 30 minutes without my skin turning red. I&#x27;m loving this mask so far and will recommend it to anyone! Speaking of that trying it out again with the roommate now as I type! Thanks innate skin!</li>
    <li> The Vitamin Infused mask feels amazing going on, and after it is rinsed off.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for is it behaves in a strange fashion when it come into contact with water.  it gets really lumpy and falls off in chunks.  It was messy in my sink and not what I had expected.  The after effects are wonderful, but just be prepared for how it reacts with water.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed about this product is how amazing it smells!  It is made with essential oils, and it smells divine.  The mask was very moisturizing.  Sometimes mud masks feel very drying, but this mask did not.  When I rinsed it off, my skin felt so smooth.  I know I will be using this again and again.  I love that the ingredients are all natural, and the fragrance is from essential oils, not artificial fragrances.  This product feels like it will be a treat for my skin and a good way to take care of myself while relaxing in the tub after a stressful day.  I know it will help my skin feel smooth and be a good part of my self care routine.</li>
    <li> A gentle but effective mud mask.  It is easy to apply and comes off easily with water.  I hate when you have to scrub your face super hard to get a mask to come off.  I have only used a few times, but my skin is softer and smoother immediately after using.  If you are seeking acne solutions, pair this with Innate Skin Clear Skin vitamin pack and get ready to love your skin.  The vitamins are seriously the best...you can buy here on Amazon or directly through the Innate Skin site.  Thanks Innate Skin!</li>
    <li> Awesome product!! Leaves my skin exfoliated and bright..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s taken me awhile to review this because I wanted to give it a chance like I gave the vitamins. It comes in a cute cloth Baggie with directions and a small spoon, so that&#x27;s awesome. I really love the earthy smell it has to it. It goes on smooth and felt really good in. I have SUPER dry skin and this definitely made my face feel moisturized even without putting lotions on afterwards. I love this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s. There costumer service is great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a week now. So far its been alright. Its fairly easy to put on, I like the feel of the mask on my skin. Although I haven&#x27;t seen that great of an impact on my skin, but I&#x27;m not going to loose hope! I really love the use of essential oils!</li>
