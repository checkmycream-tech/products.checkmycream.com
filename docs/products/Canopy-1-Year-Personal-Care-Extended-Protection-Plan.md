<li> Not sure there is anything to like other than hope I don&#x27;t have to use this warranty.</li>
<li> Product was redundant when compares to multi year guarantee from manufacturer</li>
<li> So as of now It seems to have an unnecessary expenditure if I have no recourse.</li>
<li> The one year protection insurance was unnecessary as I realized after I received the product I ordered . .</li>
<li> As for the warranty I received nothing showing that I purchased the extended warranty, so if something goes wrong with the product I do not know where to send it or what actions to take.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> never bad for extra coverage</li>
    <li> It is just a download for future protection for the razor we bought. Won&#x27;t know what I think until I try to use it!</li>
    <li> Not sure there is anything to like other than hope I don&#x27;t have to use this warranty.</li>
    <li> Registering the plan proved confusing and definitely not user friendly.  Finally after I registered it,&lt;br /&gt;the information proved incorrect?  I&#x27;m wondering since this shouldn&#x27;t be rocket science, why are they&lt;br /&gt;making it a pain?  Is this their way to avoid a pay out in case the product proves faulty?</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> Good price for a warranty</li>
    <li> This is a scam. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S THERE. I HAVEN&#x27;T HAD TO USE IT BUT IT&#x27;S THERE AND GIVES ME A PEACE OF MIND.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU,&lt;br /&gt;ROGER</li>
    <li> The one year protection insurance was unnecessary as I realized after I received the product I ordered . . that it already had a one year warranty so paying for another one year warranty was wasteful.</li>
    <li> Good deal Worth the money</li>
    <li> Great extended coverage. Glad I purchased.</li>
    <li> Product was redundant when compares to multi year guarantee from manufacturer</li>
    <li> I bought the one year plan, but as of yet have not been able to get it downloaded and saved. As of yet have not had to use, and if I did need it, how could I proof that I have it?????  I guess it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had to use it but it&#x27;s nice having it in case I do</li>
    <li> The product was great, I had an earlier model and this one is even better. As for the warranty I received nothing showing that I purchased the extended warranty, so if something goes wrong with the product I do not know where to send it or what actions to take.

    <li> Glad this protection is offered</li>
