    <li> i love how this product makes your hair feels soft it does leaves your hair shiny and strengthened your hair the smell is amazing and for the price you cant go wrong . all it takes is 3 minutes leave your hair feeling flawless ! you will not regret getting this product . i did not buy this but the way i know about the product is i got this free as a promotion from the brand but do try it out !</li>
    <li> This Aussie 3 minute miracle moist I got for free has been working well with my hair. I usually end up with dry hard even when j use a conditioner but this has been keeping my hair nice and smooth. I would suggest/ recooend this if anyone is looking for a conditioner.</li>
    <li> Smells like coconut and makes your hair feel sooo healthy even after a single use. After a week my hair was transformed. This is able to moisturize without weighing hair down which was exactly what I was looking for. This also has a great squeeze bottle which means no more playing around with caps in the shower. I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> This product is truly a game changer,  I have tried tons of products through the years to make my dry, course, thin hair more manageable and smoother to no avail.  I have only tried this product to times thus far but it is definitely a keeper and lifesaver in my book.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!&lt;br /&gt;It easily fits into your hand so you get a good squeeze of product out and it smells amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;I have a very mixed background so my hair is extremely curly and this stuff does the trick&lt;br /&gt;to tame my frizzies and keep my hair nice and relaxed. What I also love is that it smells like&lt;br /&gt;coconut! YESSSSSS!!&lt;br /&gt;I suggest that after your 3 minutes is up.. rinse your hair with cool water so your hair isn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;stripped of all the moisture that was just pumped into your locs!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product as part of a promotion from the brand.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!! :-)</li>
    <li> I recently tried the Aussie 3 minute Miracle and it made my hair so soft and shiny! It was so simple to use too! Just wash your hair as normal and use the 3 minute miracle in place of you regular conditioner. Let it set for 3 minutes, rinse and you&#x27;re on your way to a fabulous hair day!!! Who doesn&#x27;t have time for a 3 minute miracle?? Disclosure: I received this product as part of a promotion from the brand</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing! It works wonderfully! When I tried this it worked and it kept my hair frizz free for a week. Its wonderfully and I suggest u buy it</li>
    <li> Aussie, australian for amazing hair. I&#x27;d never tried an aussie product only because it is almost twice as much as the conditioners I normally use and did not eant to spend that much on a product that I wasn&#x27;t sure of. I recently received this product for testing purposes (but the opinions are my own) and I am so glad I did. I am now an aussie fan all the way. I have thin, frizzy hair that has never felt so good. I can&#x27;t use just any product because it also becomes easily greasy with heavy leave-ins. This product is heavy enough to use a pea sized amount and light enough to use 2-3 times a week without a heavy residue. Definitely give it a try with high expectations, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I got Aussies 3 minute miracle from BzzAgent totally free and I&#x27;m loving it my hair has never been so smooth and soft before</li>
    <li> this definitely made my hair softer and more moisturized. It smells amazing! I really believe everyone needs to try this at least once. It&#x27;s an awesome conditioner.</li>
    <li> I got to try the Aussie 3 minute miracle hair treatment thru Bzzagent. I workout about 5 days a week so I shower every day and I have blonde highlights so Washing my hair every day was starting to make my hair very brittle and dry. I was so excited when I joined this campaign because I&#x27;m always in search for a new hair conditioning product, I&#x27;m also a licensed cosmetologist so I can go get my hair products from the exclusive hairstylist stores like cosmoprof and etc... I used the Ausie 3 minute miracle hair treatment as soon as I recieved my bzzkit and lo and behold this product is AMAZING!!!!!!! Even after the first time I used it it made my hair silky smooth, and no tanes in sight.... After I blow dried my hair I usually have to flat iron it every time, but after even the first time I was amazed at how soft it made my hair and the volume it gave me so I didn&#x27;t even want to flat iron my hair cause I loved the way it&lt;br /&gt;Looked..... All in all I am addicted to this product and use it every day!!!!! I even went and purchased my own. Thank you Aussie for coming out with a wonderful product like this.....</li>
    <li> I received this item through bzzagent to try for free I&#x27;m a bzzagent. this product is absolutely amazing, it detangles your hair right away,I have 4b hair and it had my hair with aLot of slip. I love this deep conditioner just leave it on for 3 minutes and it will have your head moisturized.the smell is great too.</li>
    <li> I got Aussie 3 minute miracle hair treatment to try from Bzzagent, and I love it! My hair has a root color AND highlights as well, so it tends to get dry easily, I&#x27;m also in a kitchen all day, so hair washing is part of my daily routine. It doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down, it doesn&#x27;t make it oily, it leaves it smooth and easy to brush after the shower. After about a week of using it I could feel the difference, it looks shinier and it&#x27;s smooth to the touch, and it helps keep frizz controlled. I love this product, I&#x27;ve already bought my next bottle of it. Although I like the smell, it makes me feel like I&#x27;m at the beach, I&#x27;d like to have it with a different fragrance as well.</li>
    <li> One of the VERY BEST deep conditioners I have found (in almost 30 yrs of trying different hair products).... this is tried and true, and works wonders for my very thick, very dry hair....winter OR summer... it&#x27;s just the best.  Amazon offered it for a very fair price and sent it timely.</li>
    <li> I have dry long frizzy hair and its always a problem to find a good conditioner that will moisturize my hair and tame the frizz. So I always put it up in a bun to skip all the hard work and lots of styling products in the morning. Once I tried Aussie 3 Minute Miracle I was really impressed, my hair was very soft, manageable, shiny and almost frizz-free and it smelled delicious. It really moisturized my hair and it wasn&#x27;t as hard to brush it after washing it. So I really love the product, the only thing I would say that the scent is a bit too strong for my preference, but the conditioner is great. I received the product as a part of promotion thanks to Aussie.</li>
    <li> Love it a lot! Keeps my damaged hair super soft!</li>
    <li> This has to be the best conditioner I have used to date. It leaves your hair feeling sooo silky, smooth and soft. Especially if you like bleaching or coloring your hair, like me! Or if its just dry, then def try this out. It smells soo good too (:</li>
    <li> Perfect for long thick hair; does what it says!</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I have extremely fry hair from over processing.  I have colored my hair many times and I straighten my hair everyday.  Hair dryer and straightening iron on my hair everyday has certainly taken its toll.  I always look for products that can help my dry hair.  This was it!  After thousands, and I mean thousands, of products, I finally found one that works!  The Aussie 3 minute miracle!  It is so quick and easy as well as effective!  It is in a very easy to use bottle which is great for the shower.  It goes on in the shower and only takes 3 minutes!  My hair instantly felt softer.  I have now been using every other day for 1 week and my hair is transformed.  It leaves no oily or greasy feel and my hair is not weighed down.  It also has such a wonderful smell which is important to me.  Overall this is a great product and I love it.  I would recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s hair needs a little TLC!!</li>
    <li> Everything was ok. Thanks</li>
    <li> I have always had a problem with dry/frizzy hair. I have thick course curly hair and hardly anything worked to keep it shiny and smooth. I have tried TONS of products and nothing worked well. That is until I got the Aussie 3 minute miracle free thanks to Aussie. My hair is smoother and shiny and feels amazing!!! The price is affordable. And bonus it smells wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> This products is great!!!! I have dry, frizzy, curly, color treated hair and use a straightener as well so you can imagine the condition of my hair.  I received a sample of this through bzzagent and couldn&#x27;t be happier to be able to sample such a great products.  After using this, my hair felt smooth, less frizzy, a nice shine with no greasy feeling, and a great scent!!!  Once my sample is gone, I will be purchasing this for sure!</li>
    <li> I received this product to review and I am so glad I did. I absolutely love it. I have very naturally thick coarse hair that I flat iron a lot. This is the only deep conditioner I&#x27;ve used that not only conditions my hair but it doesn&#x27;t make it feel flat and greasy at the same time. I will keep using this product for sure. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> I have over-coloured highlighted fine hair and this product revives it. It detangles like a champ and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. I buy 3 bottles at once so I never run out. Highly recommend it!! :)</li>
    <li> This 3 minute miracle from Aussie is the best thing I&#x27;ve had so far. Literally tried a lot of products. My mother cuts hair for a living so I would get my products from wholesale places. Also I&#x27;m a buzz agent and I was invited to a campaign for this product. Must I say #GotItFree and it left my hair smooth and not dry. I have damaged hair from dying it so much and I would have to do hair treatments all the time just so it can feel great. But when I tried it the first time I was shocked on how smooth my hair was. My hair would feel rough and dead. I could literally run my fingers through my hair with no problem. I give this product a 5 star. Thanks Aussie for a wonderful product. Future customer.</li>
    <li> I bleach and process my hair so this stuff worked really well rehydrating my hair so to speak, I ran out. but now I am trying the &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; 3 minute miracle</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. Of all the conditioners I have tried ever since, this is the one that I like most. It is easy to comb my tangled hair after shower. It is smooth and the smell is mild.</li>
    <li> Just as described and will purchase from again! :)</li>
    <li> No drama with my frizz and curls. I really love the 3 minute Aussie miracle in all the different types for different hair styles. I tried mine for free in return to give an honest opinion on this product. I tried the Moist Deeep Conditioner Mask. I love how easy it comes out of the bottle and conveniently does not leak. The thick lather covered my super curly hair. I was happy with the fresh scent also. The scent was not overwhelming and just right.  I would love to use this weekly to spruce up my limp hair. Easy to get all my tangles out especially with long hair like mine is.</li>
    <li> My sister stole this from my bathroom! It works wonders for half the price of my high-end conditioners.</li>
    <li> My hair is curly and extremely frizzy in humidity. In NC, it&#x27;s always humid, so it&#x27;s been an issue.  This seems to smooth out the frizzes.  My hair is also fine, so too much conditioner weighs it down.  Aussie works pretty darn good.  I prefer the original scent, but this one isn&#x27;t too bad.  A little coconutty.  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying it again!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Love it for my natural hair.</li>
    <li> This 3 minute conditioner really moisturizes your hair. I could tell in the bath it comprehensively moisturizes it. No tangles. Feels like silk when wet. You wash your hair, apply moisturizer and relax for 3 minutes. When dry, your hair is smooth and has a sheen. Fragrance is subtle and non-flowery. Delighted with this product. It does what it says.</li>
