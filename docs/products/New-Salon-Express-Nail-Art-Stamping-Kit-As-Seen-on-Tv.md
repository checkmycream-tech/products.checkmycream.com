      <li>It worked perfectly the very first time for me, and I recommend getting it!</li>
      <li>It came in good shipping time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheaper than the Konad system and work just as good in my opinion.</li>
      <li>&amp; it works good now.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smears and just isnt a good item.</li>
      <li>scraper is good.</li>
      <li>A lot of the reviews say that it takes practice and time, however it worked perfectly for me on my first try!</li>
      <li>But the plates where really, really nice.</li>
      <li>plate holder was nice but not needed</li>
      <li>i used my own scraper and stamper</li>
      <li>I like to use ones that are kind of runny, like the ones from Revlon.</li>
      <li>-- I have my own Konad plates that work well with the plate holder, and the stamper itself (once I cleaned it) worked just as it should.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think this product is great, and a lot of fun!</li>
      <li>great for beginners and for anyone who wants good looking nails</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>i think i will love it</li>
      <li>The tray gets in the way, if you put the metal plate on top of a napkin, you&#x27;ll be able to scrape off excess polish better.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It scrapes better and doesn&#x27;t damage your plates!&lt;br</li>
      <li>My daughter and her friends love to paint their nails</li>
      <li>I cleaned the scraper, made sure it wasn&#x27;t bent and tried again.</li>
      <li>I often skip the use of the plates favoring others, MASH being a favorite.</li>
      <li>save your money for better plates.</li>
      <li>Plus you can use regular nail polish with this system while the Konad recommends you buy the \\&quot;special\\&quot; Konad polish for best results.</li>
      <li>I was completely satisfied with these nail art stamp kit.</li>
      <li>will get it one more try</li>
      <li>My daught er love this.</li>
      <li>Most people have a curve to their nails and all this does is smear.</li>
      <li>I have some lying around for about 13 years and they haven&#x27;t thickened that much, and work great.</li>
      <li>There are others who have used this with no problem and love it; I am not one of them.</li>
      <li>I did try filing the stamper like it said in the \\&quot;Tips\\&quot; section of the instruction manual and it DID work better.</li>
      <li>Nobody got better just by quitting :)</li>
      <li>It cleans your plates easier :)</li>
      <li>The stamp is okay</li>
      <li>works okay</li>
      <li>I bought another that costs me 50Cents and worked better.</li>
      <li>it seems to work better.</li>
      <li>It may work better if you file it, but I wouldn&#x27;t know because I didn&#x27;t do it and my stamper worked just fine.</li>
      <li>Getting the stamp on clean is a pain!</li>
      <li>I was able to remove it with pure acetone polish remover, but honestly, it felt like this product belonged more in the Dollar Store than here on Amazon.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Hope this review helps enjoy :)</li>
      <li>This system is really easy to use once you get the hang of it.</li>
      <li>As soon as we took off the coating, the thing worked fine.</li>
      <li>then that works fine</li>
      <li>Also YOU MUST WORK QUICKLY!</li>
      <li>Being cheap compared to Konad, it met my expectations.</li>
      <li>Get the MASH image plates and stamper, great quality, and their stamping polishes are terrific, and affordably priced on their website.</li>
      <li>If you use cheap products you&#x27;re gonna get cheap results-simple as that.</li>
      <li>Purchased for my 9 year old grandaughter for xmas, she loved it.</li>
      <li>Love the idea, but I can&#x27;t get them to work right for my nails</li>
      <li>The seating for the plates is great and works with many other brands.</li>
      <li>some designs are pretty cute but</li>
      <li>I was so excited to try it</li>
      <li>I was excited about purchasing this product after seeing the Konad one.</li>
      <li>I tried it and it doesn&#x27;t remove the polish as cleanly as the scraper does, giving you a blotchy stamp.</li>
      <li>Its supposed to keep your plates and area clean.</li>
      <li>and I cam quickly wipe off the stamper and plate before it dries.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it really came with 4 plates because the 5th one was a repeat, but I am pretty satisfied with it</li>
      <li>It takes a while to get the han of properly scraping the paint, but once you figure it out you get really cool stamped nails! :)</li>
      <li>For the price it was worth just those hence the 4 stars.</li>
      <li>It takes practice, but is worth it.</li>
      <li>i tried everything and spent a lot of time trying to have good results but it just did not work.</li>
      <li>After putting on the nail polish quickly, the pattern when applied barely went on my nail, most of the time it stayed on the stamper tool.</li>
      <li>just right.</li>
      <li>The paint doesn&#x27;t come off right and the scrapper scratched the disk.</li>
      <li>i think once i work with this and do the designs right to transfer to my nails</li>
      <li>and then don&#x27;t get the placement of the design right</li>
      <li>The packaging the product came in was crushed on one corner, but the product is OK and works fine.</li>
      <li>Not to say the cheap stuff won&#x27;t work, but it will take a lot more effort and you will get discouraged after a couple tries (I used China Glaze btw).</li>
      <li>The stamper is double ended easy to clean and very conferrable to use.</li>
      <li>I&lt;br /&gt;Think this is a knock off which I wasn&#x27;t aware of.</li>
      <li>However, Amazon is definitely the way to go when purchasing their plates and stamper! :)</li>
      <li>You probably wont get it the first time.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i tried it the first time it didn&#x27;t work to me</li>
      <li>With my third attempt I inspected the scraper and made sure (again) that it wasn&#x27;t bent (it wasn&#x27;t).</li>
      <li>Bought this product like 2 years ago for my mom, at first when I opened it and try to use it</li>
      <li>So my friend had this set and always came to school with pretty nails</li>
      <li>However the scraper was not so hot, it scratched my plate, and even they didn&#x27;t spread the polish evenly.</li>
      <li>Was exactly as pictured.</li>
      <li>but be sure to use nail art paint because nail polish does not work properly and if you read the box it specifically recommend using nail on paint...</li>
      <li>After playing with it for 2 hours (first attempt).</li>
      <li>but it was at Walgreen&#x27;s for $10 (cheaper than how much my friend got it for and her stamper is only single sided while mines is double :D)</li>
      <li>You have to work fast, I was working pretty fast at first but wasn&#x27;t getting results, when I took it up a notch it started to work.&lt;br</li>
      <li>And that&#x27;s simply my opinion; I don&#x27;t own the Konad nor have I ever used it, but I have watched videos on YouTube and the results look exactly the same.</li>
      <li>nothing was ever accomplished by giving up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(I just used a piece of paper and it worked really well).</li>
      <li>I just gave up and I am ready to throw it away.</li>
      <li>The razor blade does not work very well.</li>
      <li>so i guess you shouldnt really be expecting much...</li>
      <li>this worked very well.</li>
      <li>and she&#x27;s also suffering (haha)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was so excited to try it but non of the images worked. The stamper is not smooth and it does not pick up the images</li>
    <li> Came just as promised</li>
    <li> i think once i work with this and do the designs right to transfer to my nails i think i will love it</li>
    <li> scraper is good. However the images are very shallow and most times don&#x27;t come out clear. The rubber stamper is a compete joke! It will stamp on flat paper really well, but tell me who has paper flat nails? Most people have a curve to their nails and all this does is smear. At least it was cheap and now my son has a stamper to use on paper. I don&#x27;t recommend this at all. save your money for better plates.</li>
    <li> Got this for my 12 yo daughter.  It is a bit messy and will definitely take alot of practice to get nice looking nail designs.</li>
    <li> Love the idea, but I can&#x27;t get them to work right for my nails, I keep getting part if the image not the whole thing. Took forever to get here so I&#x27;m a little bummed.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t at all impressed with this product.  Out of the four plates I received, two of them were scratched so horribly that they were completely unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is extremely \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; feeling -- very flimsy, and my stamper itself had some sort of scuff or something on the big end. I was able to remove it with pure acetone polish remover, but honestly, it felt like this product belonged more in the Dollar Store than here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I still gave it two stars, because I really only bought this for the stamper itself -- I have my own Konad plates that work well with the plate holder, and the stamper itself (once I cleaned it) worked just as it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, poor quality, but for the price, I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/5 Stars</li>
    <li> I could not get this product to work. It was a real disappointment to not be able to get this product to work. Different polish colors did not make a difference.</li>
    <li> I knew this was a gamble, and nI lost.. I&#x27;ve seen them everywhere, so I thought so many can&#x27;t be wrong. I was the wrong one, image plates are very shallow, cheaply made, and the stamp rubber went into the holder, I threw it away immediately, not even going to bother returning due to hassle and disappointment. Get the MASH image plates and stamper, great quality, and their stamping polishes are terrific, and affordably priced on their website. However, Amazon is definitely the way to go when purchasing their plates and stamper! :)</li>
    <li> works okay just use a card to scrap the polish off because the other thing dont work other then that works fine</li>
    <li> Being cheap compared to Konad, it met my expectations. I had no problems with this product. Will definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> its okay but yeah its a bit hard to completely transfer the designs and the designs are a bit kidish by the time i found out by the other nail stamper my order was already shipped i read and saw youtube tutorials on the other nail stamper idk what its called maybe konda or something like that but yeah some designs are pretty cute but still a bit kidish im definetly going to try and buy other stamping plates and try those...it takes alot of practice but it works so hope this is kindof helpful i mean this was a cheap order so i guess you shouldnt really be expecting much...</li>
    <li> After putting on the nail polish quickly, the pattern when applied barely went on my nail, most of the time it stayed on the stamper tool.</li>
    <li> the only downside is that it came on the last day of term, the product is as seen in the photo, and cheaply!</li>
    <li> Dont waste you time or money. Smears and just isnt a good item. It came brand new so it is NOT the sellers fault, it is the actual manufactures fault. Dont say you werent warned if you buy this here or walmart or a yard sale. It came in good shipping time.</li>
    <li> Does NOT work the stamper will not pick up the design  and I have tried multiple times and different types of polish and nothing it was a waist of money</li>
    <li> I have tried and tried and tried with this stamper! Different polishes different techniques and nothing has helped! I watched tons of youtube and still could not get it to work :( maybe it is just something im doing but I tried several way and could not get it to transfer if it did transfer on the nail it was smudged and to light.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 of them for my little girls and none of them worked, directions are easy but not effective</li>
    <li> this worked very well. the holder didn&#x27;t but the plates did. The film on these was not blue, but clear. So be warned about that. i used my own scraper and stamper The scraper is an old gift card. But the plates where really, really nice.</li>
    <li> I came with burr. I bought another that costs me 50Cents and worked better.</li>
    <li> It takes a while to get the han of properly scraping the paint, but once you figure it out you get really cool stamped nails! :)</li>
    <li> This item is really bad and does not work as advertised at all. After much trying was not able to get the thing to work evern once.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and avoid this product.</li>
    <li> I was excited about purchasing this product after seeing the Konad one. I tried if immediately and wax immensely upset the scraper scraped away every bit of nail polish EVERY SINGLE FREAKING TIME. I played with it for a long time, just playing with it and it did not work what so ever. I just gave up and I am ready to throw it away. Huge waste of time and money. I would rate it negative stars if I could. Do not get it.</li>
    <li> Plates have deep scratches and gaulges in them and are totally useless! I waited since August 26 just to receive trash...</li>
    <li> it does not work i want my money back! i normally don&#x27;t complain on things but this had to be the worse thing i spent ..</li>
    <li> I just purchased this from Sally&#x27;s last night. At first I was disappointed, but now I&#x27;m excited about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st: Use quality nail polish. If you use cheap products you&#x27;re gonna get cheap results-simple as that. Not to say the cheap stuff won&#x27;t work, but it will take a lot more effort and you will get discouraged after a couple tries (I used China Glaze btw). Also, if you use quality polishes, you won&#x27;t have to file your stamping tool. It may work better if you file it, but I wouldn&#x27;t know because I didn&#x27;t do it and my stamper worked just fine. Try it and let me know what you find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd: This system is really easy to use once you get the hang of it. If you&#x27;re in a rush, then don&#x27;t even bother opening your kit. You&#x27;re gonna want to set aside a little time to play around with this to get the image transfer just right. Practice, practice, practice. Remember...nothing was ever accomplished by giving up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3rd: If you&#x27;re new to this kit, try the stamping on your bare nails first. You can add a base coat if you want to protect your natural nails, but if you take the time to do two coats of your favorite color, let it dry and then don&#x27;t get the placement of the design right, it&#x27;s gonna tick you off because you&#x27;ll have to start all over (I learned this lesson the hard way)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with this product. It&#x27;s cheaper than the Konad system and work just as good in my opinion. And that&#x27;s simply my opinion; I don&#x27;t own the Konad nor have I ever used it, but I have watched videos on YouTube and the results look exactly the same. Plus you can use regular nail polish with this system while the Konad recommends you buy the \\&quot;special\\&quot; Konad polish for best results.</li>
    <li> This came in broken and used. It said new. There was nail polish on the disks already! My daughter begged for this and I finally gave in. She was so disappointed!</li>
    <li> I ordered this and the Konad stamping kit. I can say that I didn&#x27;t like Salon&#x27;s Express Kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I think of each piece:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail stamper was so hard that it hurt me.&lt;br /&gt;The scraper didn&#x27;t work well at all. You have to scrape several times and by the time you get it it is dry. (Konad&#x27;s gets it with one scrape)&lt;br /&gt;The plate holder was nice but not needed I put my place onto of a paper towel it seems to work better. The execs nail polish goes straight to the paper towel and I cam quickly wipe off the stamper and plate before it dries.</li>
    <li> my daughter really likes this kit. Practicing her nail technique. great for beginners and for anyone who wants good looking nails</li>
    <li> Purchased for my 9 year old grandaughter for xmas, she loved it. Was exactly as pictured. Would purchase again. ty</li>
    <li> I bought the Nail Art Kit at Walgreens and was so exicted. And after using all of the nail polishes that I had I still couldn&#x27;t get any picture from it.</li>
    <li> Before purchasing, I read all the reviews. I read the instructions. I watched videos. I bought expensive nail polish. I got everything set up and took my time. The problem I had every time I used it was with the scraper. It either wouldn&#x27;t scrape off enough and if I took a second pass, it either removed everything or just smeared what was there around more.  I cleaned the scraper, made sure it wasn&#x27;t bent and tried again. Nope.  After playing with it for 2 hours (first attempt). I cleaned everything up and put it all away.  Second attempt (different stencil and polish) was no better. With my third attempt I inspected the scraper and made sure (again) that it wasn&#x27;t bent (it wasn&#x27;t). I tried different methods of scraping, but none of them seemed to make any difference whatsoever.  I finally cleaned up everything and gave it to my niece to play with. There are others who have used this with no problem and love it; I am not one of them.</li>
    <li> So my friend had this set and always came to school with pretty nails so I asked her where she got it and she said that she got it at DD&#x27;s. I didn&#x27;t find it there but it was at Walgreen&#x27;s for $10 (cheaper than how much my friend got it for and her stamper is only single sided while mines is double :D) and I have to say that it works wonderfully! I just wanna share some tips with y&#x27;all to improve performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) my sister used the scraper that came with the set and scratched up one of the plates. And its hard to clean the scraper once you&#x27;re finished. So thats why I recommend that you use an old school ID card or expired credit card or something. It scrapes better and doesn&#x27;t damage your plates!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) USE ACETONE NAIL POLISH REMOVER!!! It cleans your plates easier :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Dont use the plate holder because theres no point in using it. Its supposed to keep your plates and area clean. But, SOMEHOW nail polish got on the bottom of the plates. So I recommend that you spread some newspaper or paper towels or something over your work area. I learned this lesson the hard way :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) PRACTICE!!! You probably wont get it the first time. Nobody got better just by quitting :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) I did try filing the stamper like it said in the \\&quot;Tips\\&quot; section of the instruction manual and it DID work better. It doesn&#x27;t make the surface as slippery so you won&#x27;t smudge your design&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) The nail polish doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to be thick in order to work better with your plates. Remember that if it&#x27;s too thick, it can get caught in your plates. I like to use ones that are kind of runny, like the ones from Revlon. I have some lying around for about 13 years and they haven&#x27;t thickened that much, and work great. But keep in mind that they don&#x27;t have to be really old to stamp well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s it!!!</li>
    <li> This is a fun nail stamper, the only thing is that when you first use the stamp its hard to get the images define. It takes practice, but is worth it.</li>
    <li> was too cheep my daughter did not like it at all sorry, its a good idea but for only for the price</li>
    <li> My daught er love this. she is always decorating her nails, seems like every other day. I have even tried it out, myself</li>
    <li> I was completely satisfied with these nail art stamp kit. I Would certainly recommend to other friends and family too.</li>
    <li> The seating for the plates is great and works with many other brands. The stamper is double ended easy to clean and very conferrable to use. However the scraper was not so hot, it scratched my plate, and even they didn&#x27;t spread the polish evenly. So i replaced it with an old store (credit) card we no longer use. This works great. On all the other brands of plates..... The actual plates here are disappointing. So shallow that you have to try several times to get a complete stamp. They are not very well cut at all, sharp on the edges, although not as sharp as some others i have found. The plates are very thin, and i am often scared they will crumple like aluminum, but they r a little more solid. I often skip the use of the plates favoring others, MASH being a favorite. But, the stamp plate seat and stamper are my go to. For the price it was worth just those hence the 4 stars.</li>
    <li> This product does take time to get the hang of. The first time I used it I was very disappointed, but kept at it &amp; it works good now.&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;1- rough up the stamper with a nail file&lt;br /&gt;2- use lots of polish on the design plate(I dab on the polish into a puddle, don&#x27;t try to paint it on)&lt;br /&gt;3- use an old gift card to scrape off excess polish&lt;br /&gt;4- don&#x27;t scrape the polish off too hard- be gentle&lt;br /&gt;5- don&#x27;t give up- keep trying&lt;br /&gt;Good product for the price</li>
    <li> We tried using this over and over with no luck. We were extremely frustrated until we discovered that there was a clear plastic coating on the plates that aren&#x27;t noticeable at all, and there is no mention of this in the directions. As soon as we took off the coating, the thing worked fine. We were laughing about it...</li>
    <li> I have tried this over like 1,000,000 times and it only worked 1!!!! And the sad part was I was just testing it out and I had no nail polish on my nails!! Yes I read the instructions, I used thick (not extremely) nail polish, it wasn&#x27;t cheap the nail polish, etc.&lt;br /&gt;the good thing was that it wasn&#x27;t expensive, I gave it to my friend though and she&#x27;s also suffering (haha) but I have to give this 1 star for working 1 time, if I had to rate this 1-10 I would give it 3</li>
    <li> I bought this and a whole bunch of different plates and &amp;#34;special polish&amp;#34; to try stamping. Unfortunately, I think this product is a knock off because my efforts didn&#x27;t turn out at all like the pictures. I even watched a bunch of videos to try and learn the &amp;#34;secret&amp;#34; of getting this to work, and nothing work. All of my stamps were partial images even after I tried filing the stamper pads. The pads on this stamper seem a lot harder than the ones I saw in the videos.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mom, and I&#x27;m so glad it works!!! a few tips tho;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The tray gets in the way, if you put the metal plate on top of a napkin, you&#x27;ll be able to scrape off excess polish better.&lt;br /&gt;2. You don&#x27;t have to buy special nail polish, but for the design you&#x27;ll need a color that is well saturated and would only need one coat (obviously)&lt;br /&gt;3. You have to work fast, I was working pretty fast at first but wasn&#x27;t getting results, when I took it up a notch it started to work.&lt;br /&gt;4. When stamping on your nail do a rolling motion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived as advertised and when advertised, it took a month because it was coming from China. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it really came with 4 plates because the 5th one was a repeat, but I am pretty satisfied with it and my mom is very happy with it. Hope this review helps enjoy :)</li>
    <li> The razor blade does not work very well. The stamp is okay just think I need to break it in.</li>
    <li> The packaging the product came in was crushed on one corner, but the product is OK and works fine. My daughter is happy.</li>
    <li> this is a mess, if i would known i would not have spent my money on this. i tried everything and spent a lot of time trying to have good results but it just did not work. to bad that i wasted my favorite nail polish :(</li>
    <li> I&lt;br /&gt;Think this is a knock off which I wasn&#x27;t aware of. The paint doesn&#x27;t come off right and the scrapper scratched the disk.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it&lt;br /&gt;i tried it the first time it didn&#x27;t work to me&lt;br /&gt;I will get it one more try but I tried the pink small stamping tool worken nicely the first time</li>
    <li> Tried several times to get this to work. The nail polish would never get into the design enough to pick up onto the stamper.  Save your money and get the little decals from the drugstore.</li>
    <li> I got this after it was over 2 weeks late and it doesnt work at all ive used more then 4 different types of nail polish from thin to really thick and nothing not a good product dont waste your time or money on this the stickers are cheaper and work WAYYYY better</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used anything like this before, but I was curious. I was skeptical, as it&#x27;s an \\&quot;as seen on tv\\&quot; product, and because I&#x27;m not anywhere near a professional (or even good at doing my own manicures). However, I found it at my local Target, so I figured I&#x27;d try it. I read a bunch of reviews and watched a ton of youtube videos because I was worried about messing it up or getting frustrated. A lot of the reviews say that it takes practice and time, however it worked perfectly for me on my first try! I think some of the designs are more difficult than others, or don&#x27;t work as well, such as the designs with small lines (like the rose stem), but that&#x27;s just because the polish doesn&#x27;t transfer well from very small crevices. Like a lot of other reviews said, I used an old plastic credit card instead of the scrapper, and I lightly filed the stampers before I tried. I also didn&#x27;t use the plate holder, because I read that its gets messy anyway (I just used a piece of paper and it worked really well). I think this product is great, and a lot of fun! It worked perfectly the very first time for me, and I recommend getting it!</li>
    <li> My daughter and her friends love to paint their nails so I thought this would be a great gift. It was such a dissapointment! First, it was missing 2 of the design plates, on the box it says 5, but it only came with 3. Getting the stamp on clean is a pain! The designs are too big for small nails. Thats if you can even get the design on without smearing the final product. Finally, it makes a mess! It now sits on the shelf collecting dust. Hopefully I can sell it at our next garage sale!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my granddaughter for christmas and she loves it i am not sure myself what is does shes knows as long&lt;br /&gt;as she is happy that is all that matters</li>
    <li> I tried using what i had even when it came missing a piece but this took alot of time and didn&#x27;t take shape like it was suppose to. BAD</li>
    <li> Bought this product like 2 years ago for my mom, at first when I opened it and try to use it it was horrible, it didn&#x27;t work as seen on tv at all. then I tried using it a couple times and when I got the hang of it, it worked perfect!! but be sure to use nail art paint because nail polish does not work properly and if you read the box it specifically recommend using nail on paint...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews. If you can&#x27;t use this you either didn&#x27;t follow the instructions or you&#x27;re stupid. I figured out how to use it, even producing a tri-color stamp within 5 minutes. And I&#x27;m no Einstein, so if I can do it anyone can. As other reviewers have mentioned, IT ONLY WORKS WITH A THICKER POLISH. If the polish is too thin it won&#x27;t come out right. Also YOU MUST WORK QUICKLY! If you don&#x27;t transfer within a few seconds the polish will be dry and won&#x27;t pick up. I do not recommend using a quick dry polish. Someone here recommended using a gift card instead of the scraper...I disagree. I tried it and it doesn&#x27;t remove the polish as cleanly as the scraper does, giving you a blotchy stamp. Yes the scraper scratches up your plates but it doesn&#x27;t adversely affect the stencil so who cares? Also, I only clean the plates with pure acetone. Regular remover just doesn&#x27;t get down into the grooves of the stencil like the pure stuff does.</li>
