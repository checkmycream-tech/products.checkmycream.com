      <li>Really good deal for the price.</li>
      <li>good thing</li>
      <li>I have the silver-ish lace covered one right now, and it&#x27;s absolutely perfect.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Example of a good rectangle inside design (but in this example the mechanism is cheaply made): http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00O647P2C/ref&#x3D;s9_psimh_gw_p194_d0_i5?pf_rd_m&#x3D;ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s&#x3D;desktop-1&amp;pf_rd_r&#x3D;1YHCMX204S5EYN56CFN7&amp;pf_rd_t&#x3D;36701&amp;pf_rd_p&#x3D;2079475242&amp;pf_rd_i&#x3D;desktop</li>
      <li>Looks great with real lace!</li>
      <li>Sturdy, cute, functional.</li>
      <li>And so stinking cute</li>
      <li>Otherwise, I love this box ^^</li>
      <li>but the interior could have been better.  </li>
      <li>One design flaw she found and pointed out to me is the loops to hold makeup brushes on the top of the lid.  </li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better case.</li>
      <li>more then 2 cover up bottles in one drawer besides eye shadow brushes.</li>
      <li>Love the lace and it does hold quite a bit.  </li>
      <li>I love the design inside and out.</li>
      <li>I should have read the dimensions on this better.  </li>
      <li>Super cute and functional!</li>
      <li>You can put the more skinny makeup products in the brush holders at the top, and it will still close just fine.</li>
      <li>i thought it would be more sturdy, its wobbly , but looks cool</li>
      <li>We got this for my little sister for her birthday &amp; she loved it!!!</li>
      <li>i can fit</li>
      <li>The folding drawers seem to be cheaply made.</li>
      <li>Arrived very fast and is very beautiful, I am a cosmetics distributor and love it so much that I will be purchasing another shortly.</li>
      <li>I really like this case, it is nice, good condition, but way smaller than I realized.</li>
      <li>However, the loops inside on the top can hold onto brushes, but because of their placement, putting any brushes in them really fudges up closing the box.</li>
      <li>and i love it so much</li>
      <li>She has it stocked full and brings it on all of our trips for cheer comps.</li>
      <li>It still holds a decent amount and it is cute.</li>
      <li>I love the design on this case i think its awesome the only problem i have had with this case is the drawer things inside are a bit to small for me</li>
      <li>it is sooo useful</li>
      <li>nothing can really fit in there and the box isn&#x27;t really a lined right</li>
      <li>Other than that seems like a nice case any young girl would love.  </li>
      <li>Love the outside</li>
      <li>, I just love carrying it around with me to different jobs I do and whatnot.</li>
      <li>There were a lot of complaints about not being able to close the lid when the actual makeup brushes were in the holders.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping but</li>
      <li>Only wish that the bottom container could fit taller items.</li>
      <li>Very sturdy.</li>
      <li>in the little brush loops at the top.</li>
      <li>but I was expecting a normal size caboodle.</li>
      <li>the size is not exactly as I expected</li>

    <li> We got this for my little sister for her birthday &amp; she loved it!!! She is dreaming of filling it up now!  Good quality &amp; lots of good storage options for a great price!</li>
    <li> Very stylish and holds a ton!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughters 12th birthday.  She loves it and it stores all her recently purchased makeup.  One design flaw she found and pointed out to me is the loops to hold makeup brushes on the top of the lid.  If you put anything in them you can close the case.  Other than that seems like a nice case any young girl would love.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this case, it is nice, good condition, but way smaller than I realized. My fault for not realizing the dimensions but I was expecting a normal size caboodle. It still holds a decent amount and it is cute.</li>
    <li> Arrived very fast and is very beautiful, I am a cosmetics distributor and love it so much that I will be purchasing another shortly.</li>
    <li> Love it! Looks great with real lace! Lots of space for tons of makeup and whatever you want to add, larger items on bottom. AND IT LOCKS!!</li>
    <li> Love the outside but the interior could have been better.  The bins should be rectangles not squares.  Also this is cheaper at target if you get it in the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Example of the inside design (but the caboodles case is all fabric no plastic): http://www.amazon.com/Seya-Plastic-Makeup-Cosmetic-Aluminum/dp/B00UXSDZ5G/ref&#x3D;sr_1_49?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1434424325&amp;sr&#x3D;1-49-spons&amp;keywords&#x3D;cosmetic+box&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Example of a good rectangle inside design (but in this example the mechanism is cheaply made): http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00O647P2C/ref&#x3D;s9_psimh_gw_p194_d0_i5?pf_rd_m&#x3D;ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s&#x3D;desktop-1&amp;pf_rd_r&#x3D;1YHCMX204S5EYN56CFN7&amp;pf_rd_t&#x3D;36701&amp;pf_rd_p&#x3D;2079475242&amp;pf_rd_i&#x3D;desktop</li>
    <li> Super cute and functional! Really good deal for the price. Very sturdy.</li>

    <li> This box works great for all kinds of makeup. The design is also very nice. Only wish that the bottom container could fit taller items. Otherwise it is a great product</li>
    <li> I bought this case from target and i love it so much</li>
    <li> I LOOOOOVE this! it is sooo useful and I use it for my crafting/art supplies&lt;br /&gt;I actually got it at target but I just saw it now.. it&#x27;s still the bomb.com</li>
    <li> This was a great score! I love the design inside and out. It is sturdy within its construction. However one of the keys have already bent..good thing there are two.</li>
    <li> This case was amazing! You can put the more skinny makeup products in the brush holders at the top, and it will still close just fine. There were a lot of complaints about not being able to close the lid when the actual makeup brushes were in the holders. I just put all my actual brushes in the bottom of this case (since there is quite a bit of wiggle room down there...and I have a TON of brushes), and I put my eyeliners, eyebrow pencils, lip liners, et cetera in the little brush loops at the top. Works like a charm. And so stinking cute, I just love carrying it around with me to different jobs I do and whatnot. Perfect! Would definitely buy this again. Maybe in the pink lace next time. I have the silver-ish lace covered one right now, and it&#x27;s absolutely perfect. Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better case.</li>
    <li> My 13 year daughter purchased this case and just loves it. She has it stocked full and brings it on all of our trips for cheer comps. It has held up perfectly, for about 6 months..and counting.</li>
    <li> i thought it would be more sturdy, its wobbly , but looks cool</li>
    <li> I love the design on this case i think its awesome the only problem i have had with this case is the drawer things inside are a bit to small for me i can fit more then 2 cover up bottles in one drawer besides eye shadow brushes. It don&#x27;t have pictures but 3 shelfs on each side pull out and bigger then expected</li>
    <li> Perfect condition thank you</li>
    <li> Fast shipping but nothing can really fit in there and the box isn&#x27;t really a lined right and once you lock it its hard to unlock</li>
    <li> Beautiful and spacious. Would be 5 stars but it won&#x27;t close if you put brushes in the brush holsters.</li>
    <li> I should have read the dimensions on this better.  Thought it was bigger.  Love the lace and it does hold quite a bit.  The folding drawers seem to be cheaply made.</li>
    <li> the size is not exactly as I expected</li>
    <li> Sturdy, cute, functional. Lots of room!</li>
