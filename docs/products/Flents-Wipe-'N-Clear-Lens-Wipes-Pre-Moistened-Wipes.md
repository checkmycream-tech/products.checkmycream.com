      <li>this is the BEST!  </li>
      <li>Still looking for the best wipes !!!</li>
      <li>and now they are perfect!</li>
      <li>great product!</li>
      <li>This is a very good product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m extremely happy that I did.  </li>
      <li>The worked great for my computer screens, but not for my glasses which is the reason I got them.</li>
      <li>They work better than any eyeglasses cleaner I have ever used!</li>
      <li>So for every package of 30 (one package) is more like 60!</li>
      <li>Bought these to have something handy at my office desk.</li>
      <li>nice to just keep in the drawer at work.</li>
      <li>I love these.</li>
      <li>I tried one of these and immediately bought a dozen more.  </li>
      <li>(I have also been thinking of combining rubbing alcohol with vanilla extract to make a satisfying and affordable aftershave, but that&#x27;s another story).</li>
      <li>love the packaging -</li>
      <li>What I do now is just ream the hole in the top a bit with a pen and that seems to have solved the issue</li>
      <li>Instead, get a box of the indivually wrapped Wipe &#x27;N Clears, those work much better.  </li>
      <li>Probably because they clean so well that you don&#x27;t have to use so many of them.  </li>
      <li>So easy in the canester.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m so cheap I even own my first dime).</li>
      <li>I typcially use them once a night to clean 3 pair of glasses then wipe off my netbook screen.</li>
      <li>No longer do you need to search through your drawers, bag or even your pockets to always keep your lenses clean.</li>
      <li>Great cloth part, but when you use these keep a clean dry cloth around to wipe the excess off with.</li>
      <li>Of every product I have ever used to clean my specs</li>
      <li>I received the package a full three days before the estimated arrival date.</li>
      <li>With Wipe &#x27;N Clear, cleaning your glasses is as easy as popping a pre-moistioned clothe right out of the easy dispenser!</li>
      <li>I will definitely be buying more of these wipes, assuming Amazon keeps selling them. :)</li>
      <li>There enought moisture in them, but it also dries fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>Each wipe came in their own individual wrap.  </li>
      <li>I was able to use each wipe more than once because they are larger and very moist.  </li>
      <li>The Wipe &#x27;N Clear Lens Wipes from Rock Ridge Sales come in a plastic container that easily allows one at a time usage, and no drying out.  </li>
      <li>The solution in the wipes doesn&#x27;t dry on it&#x27;s own</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll stick to the individually wrapped wipes which I love.  </li>
      <li>The hole in the top seems to always cut off the next sheet</li>
      <li>This 30-count dispenser has a lid with a opening that keeps moisture inside while being able to pull the next one out just as you would pull a tissue from its box or dispenser.</li>
      <li>Overpriced for sure but are moist enough to wipe 2 pairs of glasses and 2 tablets every couple of days.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll need to use a finger to stop the next in line from exiting with the one you are pulling out, putting pressure on it so the wipe easily separates, and allows the continer top to snap shut for the next usage.</li>
      <li>You will also note the gentle aroma of rubbing alcohol when you remove a swab.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast too.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s better than any other wipe i&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>and I need another cloth to go back and clean up my lens.</li>
      <li>Gave it a 2 star only because the product does clean somewhat.</li>
      <li>After trying these, we will likely be sticking with the more known brands of lens cleaners, but would definitely not buy these again.</li>
      <li>Having never worn glasses until the ripe old age of 45, I have been abusive of glass lenses for a number of years, graduating from leaving them in the same pocket with the keys to wiping them with any cloth surface available.</li>
      <li>and you have to open the top to get it threaded back again.</li>
      <li>Just pop, Wipe &#x27;N Clear!</li>
      <li>Funny how much smaller this product is than it appeared in the picture.</li>
      <li>only difference here is that I purchased my product from an exclusive, very upscale pharmaceutical salon known as Rite-Aid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My wife and I are a little obsessive about keeping our lenses clean.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s small enough to fit in your pocket if you are a man, and small enough to fit in your purse if you are a woman--or a man, and it&#x27;s a one-step wipe.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was so surprised to find it only about 3 inches tall.</li>
      <li>They come out of the container pretty wet and left streaks on my glasses.</li>
      <li>it really is nice to have the wipes pre-moistened for when my glasses get some weird gunk on them.</li>
      <li>As other reviewers noted, they do not pull out of the container smoothly and they do not clean near as well as other wipes we&#x27;ve used.  </li>

<li> unfortunately, they leave a film</li>
<li> Never suffer from dirty lenses again!</li>
<li> I am disappointed with these lens wipes.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love these. So easy in the canester. Overpriced for sure but are moist enough to wipe 2 pairs of glasses and 2 tablets every couple of days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought several makes and styles of pre-moistened lens wipes from CVS, Walgreen, Walmart and others.  Each wipe came in their own individual wrap.  That requires tearing and disposing each time a wipe was used.  One in ten were dryed out upon opening the individual wrap.    The Wipe &#x27;N Clear Lens Wipes from Rock Ridge Sales come in a plastic container that easily allows one at a time usage, and no drying out.  You&#x27;ll need to use a finger to stop the next in line from exiting with the one you are pulling out, putting pressure on it so the wipe easily separates, and allows the continer top to snap shut for the next usage.</li>
    <li> I do not like these glasses wipes. They are made from a hard material that I think will scratch my lens if used over time. The solution in the wipes doesn&#x27;t dry on it&#x27;s own and I need another cloth to go back and clean up my lens. The worked great for my computer screens, but not for my glasses which is the reason I got them.</li>
    <li> love the packaging - it&#x27;s better than any other wipe i&#x27;ve used. wipes pop up and stay moist until the last one. unfortunately, they leave a film so I have to use a dry lens cleaner after wiping.</li>
    <li> Having never worn glasses until the ripe old age of 45, I have been abusive of glass lenses for a number of years, graduating from leaving them in the same pocket with the keys to wiping them with any cloth surface available. But with this product I have been awarded the diploma in glass eye (?) eye glass care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t require a spray and then a tissue to wipe. This 30-count dispenser has a lid with a opening that keeps moisture inside while being able to pull the next one out just as you would pull a tissue from its box or dispenser. In fact I don&#x27;t even use that feature, preferring to reach in and grab one and replacing it for use again. (I&#x27;m so cheap I even own my first dime). You will also note the gentle aroma of rubbing alcohol when you remove a swab. (I have also been thinking of combining rubbing alcohol with vanilla extract to make a satisfying and affordable aftershave, but that&#x27;s another story). It&#x27;s small enough to fit in your pocket if you are a man, and small enough to fit in your purse if you are a woman--or a man, and it&#x27;s a one-step wipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only difference here is that I purchased my product from an exclusive, very upscale pharmaceutical salon known as Rite-Aid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is your home for one-step wiping!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product.  The wipes stay moist and do not leave any residue on the lens. I use it daily and like the quality and the packaging.</li>
    <li> Bought these to have something handy at my office desk. The wipes themselves are smaller than their siblings in the foil individual pouches. They come out of the container pretty wet and left streaks on my glasses. However, after about a month on my desk, the wipes in the container were bone dry and rendered useless.  I&#x27;ll stick to the individually wrapped wipes which I love.  Take a pass on these.</li>
    <li> Instead, get a box of the indivually wrapped Wipe &#x27;N Clears, those work much better.  These wipes are thinner, smaller, and much less absorbant the invidual ones. The dispenser version wipes come out way too wet and leave a streaky, wet film on your glasses, making them absolutely USELESS!</li>
    <li> My wife and I are a little obsessive about keeping our lenses clean. I was excited for the convenience of not having to open individual packets but these wipes are so moist, once you use them,   little solution drops are left behind. Great cloth part, but when you use these keep a clean dry cloth around to wipe the excess off with. Still looking for the best wipes !!!</li>
    <li> If you are going to use this product on glasses with an anti-glare effect on them,do not use this product.</li>
    <li> These glass wipes leave a dry residue on your glasses and you have to get a secondary cloth (not another wipe) and wipe off your glasses. Gave it a 2 star only because the product does clean somewhat. Would not recommend this product because it does not clean clearly as stated on the container.</li>
    <li> Of every product I have ever used to clean my specs this is the BEST!  The wipes contain alcohol which gets rid of dirt, oil, and finger prints.  They are so convenient.  You don&#x27;t need a bottle of spray cleaner and a cloth and the container is small enough to put in your purse.  The 30 wipes last longer than I thought they would.  Probably because they clean so well that you don&#x27;t have to use so many of them.  I tried one of these and immediately bought a dozen more.  When they run out I plan on buying another dozen.  Oh, and my husband swears by them, too.</li>
    <li> I purchased two packages of these wipes, because they were running low on stock.  I&#x27;m extremely happy that I did.  They work better than any eyeglasses cleaner I have ever used! They remove oil, dirt, fingerprints... you name it!  They even removed the streaks my previous cleaning wipes (wipes from Target) left behind.  I was able to use each wipe more than once because they are larger and very moist.  So for every package of 30 (one package) is more like 60! The price was low compared to the quality of the product.  Shipping was fast too.  I received the package a full three days before the estimated arrival date. I will definitely be buying more of these wipes, assuming Amazon keeps selling them. :)</li>
    <li> I like the cleaning job these do. I typcially use them once a night to clean 3 pair of glasses then wipe off my netbook screen. There enought moisture in them, but it also dries fairly quickly. I like the actual product, but not the dispenser. The hole in the top seems to always cut off the next sheet and you have to open the top to get it threaded back again. What I do now is just ream the hole in the top a bit with a pen and that seems to have solved the issue and now they are perfect!</li>
    <li> Very few towelettes.  A ripoff!</li>
    <li> Funny how much smaller this product is than it appeared in the picture. I was so surprised to find it only about 3 inches tall. I had it only a couple of weeks before it was totally dried out and completely worthless.</li>
    <li> great product! it really is nice to have the wipes pre-moistened for when my glasses get some weird gunk on them. nice to just keep in the drawer at work.</li>
    <li> Never suffer from dirty lenses again! With Wipe &#x27;N Clear, cleaning your glasses is as easy as popping a pre-moistioned clothe right out of the easy dispenser!
