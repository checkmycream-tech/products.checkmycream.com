<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> As with the corresponding shampoo, this is very heavily fragranced. I knew going in it was not fragrance free, but really wish it were.</li>
    <li> I had never tried this conditioner before and decided to get it because I was getting the shampoo, it was a good deal with free shipping!  I was happy with my purchse, this made my hair feel smoother and I like the scent.</li>
    <li> I switched to this product after using the same shampoo and conditioner for years. My hair was beginning to get dried out at the ends and I was sustaining a large amount of hair loss. After the first use of the shampoo and conditioner my hair was noticeably softer and over time I have seen a reduction in hair loss. I even colored and highlighted my hair since purchasing this product and I still feel a softening of my hair. The Shampoo also smells delicious! I am very happy with the switch!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair so I am picky about what I use in my hair.  My hair is really long so I need a lot of conditioner.  I am also picky about scents so I am really limited in what I use on my hair.  I use conditioner to co-wash my hair....Curly Girl book.  This conditioner works so well.  It makes my hair so soft and it smells so good.  I use conditioner to clean my hair and to style my hair.  I use conditioner as a leave in or I will use it as a deep conditioner. It just depends on what my hair needs at that time.  This is an all purpose conditioner for me.  My daughter also has long hair and it works well on her hair.  I put it in my hair and finger comb it.  It is really good for curly hair because the essential oils.  This conditioner is wonderful...</li>
    <li> I have long, naturally coarse hair that becomes a tangled mess very easily. This conditioner make my hair softer and silkier, plus it makes it a lot easier to comb right after the shower. It still doesn&#x27;t make me look like I have hair from a Pantene commercial, but so far it is the best conditioner I have found.</li>
    <li> I have used dove conditioners in past but they were not oil conditioners. This one makes my hair feel oily and not smooth/silky as a conditioner is supposed to make. I will just finish this faster and go back to AVEENO which is 100 times better than this.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it makes my hair soft.  It is a great value this bottle is much bigger than the store sized bottle.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is amazing from the first use.  I have long thick blonde hair... very thick.  I also get highlights a few times a year.  This brings out a nice wave in my hair.  It manages frizz awesomely.  It smells nice and leaves my hair soft.  I have used the highest priced shampoos and conditioners and after months of repeated use they haven&#x27;t held up to this.  And it&#x27;s not one of those conditioners that makes your hair feel great the first few times and then heavy and dingy from then on.  I&#x27;ve been using it for weeks and the results are the same.</li>
    <li> This conditioner makes my hair pretty soft.  However, I notice that it&#x27;s still a little dry every now and then, mostly because it&#x27;s winter and super cold and dry outside.  I&#x27;ve just been using a deep conditioner about once a week and this seems to help.  For an everyday product, this is good.</li>
    <li> Good conditioner, nothing special</li>
    <li> cheap and gets the job done, even if its with lots of oil</li>
    <li> I use this product a couple times a week. I love it! I henna my hair and it can leave it very dry feelings. this conditioner leaves me hair feeling smooth and soft. I will be buying this every couple months!</li>
    <li> my long hair.is dry and dry and dry and little bit curly.this comditioner do the great job on my hair.if  you looking for a daily conditioner and you have dry hair you should try this produce</li>
    <li> This conditioner is definitely not for everyone.  It is extremely rich, so if you have oily hair, I would stay away.  I would say my hair hits both extremes.  It can be dry after a shower, but gets oily quickly so I usually need to wash my hair every day.  But I LOVE this conditioner.  It is rich and luscious- and makes my hair extremely manageable.  I used to use [[ASIN:B000GCW1P4 Aussie Moist 3 Minute Miracle Moist Deeeeep Liquid Conditioner, 8 oz]] to deep condition my hair, but there is no need for deep conditioning if you use this conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only suggestion- my face started to break out when I first started to use this conditioner.  I used to wash my face while I let my conditioner soak into my hair (and then rinse out the conditioner after rinsing my face), but now I rinse out the conditioner and then wash my face.  That keeps any residue from the conditioner off my face, so now I&#x27;m back to having clear skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want more manageable and tangle free hair, I highly recommend trying this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I used to use this conditioner with the shampoo of the same product line ([[ASIN:B006T8BWUE Dove Nourishing Oil Shampoo, 25.4 Ounce]]), but I found the whole combination was just too rich for my hair.  So now I use a less intense shampoo that is more cleansing than nourishing ([[ASIN:B001TSJHFQ Dove Damage Therapy Intensive Repair Shampoo, 25.4 oz]], or [[ASIN:B00B1DSBSI Pantene Pro-V Truly Natural Hair Clarifying Shampoo 12.6 Fl Oz]])</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know a lot about hair conditioners, so I really can&#x27;t say I &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; this product, but I do like it.  Nice price, too.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Awfull...gave me and my daughter a rash.</li>
    <li> I got this to match the Dove Shampoo, and expect they will go well together, as they are made for each other.The previous pair of Dove fragrance free Dove shampoo and conditioner do not seem to be available any more.</li>
    <li> I have always loved Dove Body Wash so I gave this a shot. It also met my expectations. Makes my hair feel silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! What more can I say, but it is really good. Rinses nice and moisturizes nicely. Also, bonus I LOVE the way Dove products smell. This is probably one reason it is my most reached for Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
    <li> Ok, so after ditching my adult lifelong relationship with Nexxus Humectress (they changed their formula, but that&#x27;s another review) I went online in search of some good conditioners to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to a \\&quot;best conditioners\\&quot; article and this Dove was listed in the number one spot (out of 16).&lt;br /&gt;So, coming from swearing by salon products, I was totally skeptical. This stuff is under $8.00 for a huge bottle...!&lt;br /&gt;But since it wasn&#x27;t a huge investment, I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;Wow, I am pleasantly surprised. My hair isn&#x27;t weighed down and it isn&#x27;t frizzy, it has some volume.&lt;br /&gt;I have thinner hair but lots of it, it gets fly away in the winter if I don&#x27;t use the right product and will get too weighed down if I don&#x27;t use the right product...my hair can be dry since it&#x27;s on the thinner side and I also color it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did purchase 2 others from the list, and they&#x27;re good as well. So for any Humectress customers out there, there is hope!&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy, and I use this about 3-4 times a week in addition to regular Head &amp; Shoulders.  It keeps my hair from becoming too dry and frizzy.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know anything about &#x27;conditioners&#x27;  but after using this my hair has drastically improved.  Instead of being flat and lifeless it is now nice and full.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. Lathers nicely, washes out cleanly and keeps my hair soft and smooth for blow drying. Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair and this conditioner worked the best ever.  I highly recommend it.  I cannot seem to find it in the stores - only online at Amazon.</li>
    <li> really hit the spot this time with this conditioner , my dry hair was amazing after so soft and the curls so curly as never before .. I use it with combination with the shampoo .. if you have dry curly hair or dye a lot like me it is recommended .. not good effect on tiny silky straight hair  as this product will make the hair flat and not what you looking for unless your hair are really damaged and freeze</li>
    <li> it is very light weight and keeps my hair mosturized too .. as now a days i have dry hair which are otherwise normal.. very happy with this product .. I use it with same shampoo</li>
    <li> Who knew you could get fired up over conditioner!? But I have long white hair, and have tried several products that change the color of my hair, without improving the &amp;#34;feel.&amp;#34; There are a few items out there just for white hair, some silly expensive, and the few I tried also changed the color. I know many people don&#x27;t like their white hair, but I do - it is as close to blonde as this very dark brunette will ever get!  Once I read that white hair is damaged hair, I stopped trying &amp;#34;for white hair&amp;#34;, and concentrated on products that mentioned damaged, dry, etc. This stuff is the best! Nice aroma, normal, young again texture, soft feel - I feel like those ads with the moving, shiny hair again!  Thanks Dove and Amazon!</li>
    <li> It took too much product at once to properly cleanse and nourish my hair. I barely got two or three uses out of the huge bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It smells like heaven and ALWAYS leaves my hair feeling silky.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this conditioner yet, but all the Dove hair products are awesome, so this one will be too.</li>
    <li> Inferior quality. Or, I guess &amp;#34;You get what you pay for ...&amp;#34; is so true in this case. I hope that they could improve it a bit more.</li>
    <li> this is great! the shampoo and conditioner is amazing. it makes my hair soft, shiny, and the oil makes my hair not frizzy. i will buy this shampoo and conditioners until they stop selling it! &lt;3</li>
    <li> This is one of the few conditioners that my hair &amp;#34;likes&amp;#34;, i.e. actually untangles my long, fine hair! :) Love Dove conditioner!</li>
    <li> I have tried lots do conditioners and this one works the best for me. I like the smoothness after conditioning my hair. There is less static in my hair too :). I can easily comb my hair after conditioning with dove.</li>
    <li> Most brand shampoo I used so far is not satisfying because all I want is moisturizing my hair! Dove did that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to make of this. I love Dove products, and have used their conditioners in the past with good results. This  particular conditioner was the most moisturizing of all, and yet my hair isnt reacting the way it usually does.  It is dryer and more tangled than it should be.&lt;br /&gt;I find myself wondering if this is the actual Dove product?&lt;br /&gt;I noticed the difference with the first use, but to be fair I used it twice more. No question about it, my hair is coming out dry, when it shouldn&#x27;t be. Maybe I just got a bad or old bottle of conditioner, but having used this prior, I can definitely state that something is off here.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to contact Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for long hair, buying it through subscribe and save is even cheaper than I can get it in the store, even with a coupon!</li>
    <li> This leaves your hair silky soft every time.  It&#x27;s a bit on the thick side and needs more than most, so it loses a star.</li>
    <li> I like Dove and how they&#x27;re a good company and they also make good products like shampoo.  It&#x27;s similar to Pantene Pro-V but feels really good on the hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really prefer the smell of this conditioner as I like floral and clean smelling products for my hair.  However, it is moisturizing and gets the job done for a daily conditioner.  I will probably not purchase this product again.  Also, I feel for the price, this bottle should&#x27;ve came in a liter.</li>
    <li> Great price on products we need to buy often.  I have started to get things that I have to buy all the time for my household through amazon prime.  The prices are much better... they get delivered (quickly) right to my house... I can buy bulk (which you can&#x27;t do in a small town)... so far no problems... fast ans free shipping... Amazon Prime has changed my life.  I has definitely given me more time and less worry.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but the product I got from Amazon almost seems &amp;#34;generic.&amp;#34; It did not perform the same, or anywhere near as well, as the Dove Nourishing Oil products I purchased at my local CVS. I wonder what the reason for this is?&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love the Dove Nourishing Oil Shampoo and Conditioner! It is a perfect balance between moisturized, perfect looking hair and frizz control without looking &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;. There are a lot of shampoos and conditioners that I have tried that just don&#x27;t rinse out, leaving my hair looking horrible all day. This is NOT the case with this combination! I highly recommend both!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, thick hair that can be difficult to manage - but this product is perfect to use and then I do nothing more than let my hair dry - it looks great and feels clean and light all day long!!</li>
    <li> Good conditioner just makes my hair a little too oily. Not a bad product just not right for my hair type. Smells good.</li>
    <li> I copy/paste this from the other dove oil care product I bought but, it is still true.:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the IT. I am a natural 4b/c tiny ringlets. This dove line has always done wonders for me. To be a non-natural/commercial product it work better than some Whole Foods organic products. Smells like heaven, my hair is instantly softer, manageable, greats shine. It stays like that days after and even after using it for months start, it delivers great results still. I used for about a year and went to other products thinking I need a change. I recently bought this and the daily conditioner ( every product in the Nourishing oil care (gold) is worth it. I don&#x27;t know why but my hair drinks it in. My hair has a bounce to also.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is it does not rinse clean. You have to scrub your scalpel or risk buildup.i put with this because it works.</li>
    <li> does not leave hair oily, use shampoo and serum also, love all Dove products, would recommend for any hair type</li>
    <li> And here I thought Dove conditioner couldn&#x27;t get any better. The original was a great product, but this latest one blows away the whole line of Dove conditioners, all of which are just scented. I have wavy, long medium to thick hair which turns dry, tangles extremely easily, and is mostly painstakingly difficult to brush, especially when I try to put it up in a simple ponytail. This product has been my answer to keeping my hair manageable. It reduces dryness, tangling, and keeps a nice shine, especially if a little conditioner is left in. To top it off,  brushing is also a breeze, saving much time and effort en lieu of having to split up my hair into small sections, so it doesn&#x27;t all tangle back together with the brush. Dove also offers leave in oil conditioner and oil spray, but this is plenty by itself. I would say this is a must for long hair, unless you can afford the more expensive products out there.</li>
    <li> good product try it you fall in love with</li>
    <li> I love how my hair feels fresh and smooth also I like the size of the bottle good to last long</li>
    <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t feel as dry and useless as it used to be. My hair feels healthier and I&#x27;ve experienced nice hair growth.</li>
    <li> Dove has always been my number one goto brand for hair and body products because they moisturize, smell awesome, and they \\&quot;make my dollar hollar.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one star missing only for the reason that they do not claim that their products are not tested on animals.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s perfect for my curls I hope&lt;br /&gt;Dove does not discontinue it because they seem to have a new formulation on the market and I hate the new one</li>
    <li> I recently stopped using this conditioner after something like 10 months of use.  I really wanted to like it -- I love some other Dove products -- but it just wasn&#x27;t the right product for me.  I realize that the success or failure of a hair conditioner can depend a lot on your hair type and texture, so if your hair sounds different from mine (described below), don&#x27;t let my review stop you from buying it.  It might very well work for other hair types.  (It&#x27;s also fairly inexpensive and widely available, smells fine, and doesn&#x27;t set off any of my various skin contact allergies, so it does get a couple of stars for that.  Oh yes, and it actually rinses out of the bathtub quite easily; this is important because if a conditioner leaves a residue, the bathtub gets slippery which is, of course, dangerous!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Caucasian, with waist-length, chemically-treated (dyed) hair.  I wear it loose and never blow-dry or use any sort of heat treatments.  My hair is fairly thick, and I do have to shampoo it every day because I work out and tend to sweat a lot when I exercise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I was really hoping to get out of this conditioner was a reduction in frizz, a property which is advertised on the bottle.  I live in Atlanta, it&#x27;s humid, and I have a frizz problem.  I&#x27;ve heard great things about argan oil (one of the ingredients); it seems to be all the rage these days (sometimes you also hear it called \\&quot;Moroccan oil\\&quot;).  But this conditioner does not do one thing to stop my hair from getting frizzy.  My hair is not particularly smooth after using this conditioner, either.  I&#x27;ve never really had a problem with tangling, so I can&#x27;t speak to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I&#x27;ve switched brands from this to one from Vidal Sassoon that contains more silicone oils and few or no natural oils, which seems to be just the thing for me.</li>
    <li> My sister visited me and left a bottle of this shampoo and conditioner in my shower.  her loss. I love this stuff.  I have long dark hair and do a lot of curling/straightening etc.  this is like silk.  Ordering it online was less expensive and came right to my house.  :-)</li>
    <li> My mother got me started using Dove Shampoo and Conditioners.  She and I both have straight, very fine hair.  Dove conditioners have always been great but this new Dove Nourishing Oil Conditioner has such a great no-weight oil infusion that combing my waist length wet hair is so easy.  It is nice that it doesn&#x27;t leave any heavy residue either.  Great Job Dove!</li>
    <li> I love Dove products. Especially oil conditioner, I used it for almost 1 year and works so good on my hair.</li>
