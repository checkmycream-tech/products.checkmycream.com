      <li>She is happy with it and we are definitely seeing a difference in her acne.</li>
      <li>4 1/2 oz would run nearly $23 at the supermarket so it was a good score for $9.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works!!!</li>
      <li>it really works,my son&#x27;s acne is getting better,doesn&#x27;t have that much break out now,he tried sulfur cream,neutrogena,and aveeno acne cream,so far this works best</li>
      <li>This product was very good value for money, only about £13 in UK money, and you get three really large tubes.</li>
      <li>Also, don&#x27;t wear any make up to cover the acne while you are doing the treatment, the face have to be clean with the product on only!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Otherwise, good use for daily basis.</li>
      <li>This is the only thing that keeps my face at bay; this is a good brand that works for me.</li>
      <li>However, this is a great product to get rid of other kinds of acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Quick drying, works overnight.</li>
      <li>Blemishes are reduced in size quickly.</li>
      <li>Works much better than the B-peroxide you normally find in the store.</li>
      <li>Good product for minor acne, not greasy, it works well.</li>
      <li>The tubes are large, and the cream comes out easily.</li>
      <li>so I was really happy that I had this product in hand to use a few days after ordering.  </li>
      <li>I rarely get a pimple, I was trying proactive before this</li>
      <li>Works very well!</li>
      <li>I used to only be able to get this with a prescription and now it&#x27;s OTC</li>
      <li>I started with the 5% which I would recommend trying first before moving onto this 10% one.</li>
      <li>Now I look like I&#x27;ve been punched in the face a couple of times along with pretty visible brown spots where the acnes are.  </li>
      <li>Would be better if one could buy them individually, but I guess it&#x27;s like a Costco buy.</li>
      <li>The first week I used it twice a day</li>
      <li>I will not be ordering the other kind again.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this product because of all the positive reviews it was given.  </li>
      <li>I have some pretty persistanet pimple problem and this really helps.</li>
      <li>UK Marketing don&#x27;t realise that you need to clear up spots quickly.</li>
      <li>but its worth it for clear skin!</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, 10% is pretty high to start out with.</li>
      <li>I have tried several different acne medications and have never seen results as amazing as the results I got from using this product.  </li>
      <li>But then Zapzyt costs almost as much for a 1 oz. tube.</li>
      <li>but it really didn&#x27;t except that everything&#x27;s turn brown/dark brown except my skin</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> 10/10 facial aesthetics through the roof!  Here is my morning ritual, I call it &amp;#34;the terminator&amp;#34;. First I crouch down in the shower in the classic &amp;#34;naked terminator traveling through time&amp;#34; pose.  With my eyes closed I crouch there for a minute, visualizing either Arnold or the guy from the second movie (not the chick in the third one because that one sucked) and I start to hum the terminator theme. Then I slowly rise to a standing position and open my eyes. It helps me to proceed through my day as an emotionless, cyborg badass. The only problem is if the shower curtain sticks to my terminator leg. It ruins the fantasy. I found tonight that it is more successful to progressively humm it louder as you perform the ritual.</li>
    <li> dried my face. use the 5% instead.</li>
    <li> This product is a life saver. I had terrible acne for a while, and using this another scrub product does the trick! Don&#x27;t buy into crazy expensive products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using it twice a day and now I use it on breakouts and troublesome areas</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. It is really closing up the blackheads and open pores.</li>
    <li> I bought this in order to clear up some consistent acne breakouts I had been having on my face. The first week I used it twice a day and it REALLY dried out my skin. I altered my application ritual and I now apply it only at night after I have put on face lotion. I avoid putting it in around my eyes and mouth due to the potency of the cream and the sensitive skin. In addition, I avoid putting it over my eyebrows, I found it caused my eyebrows to have &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This product was very good value for money, only about £13 in UK money, and you get three really large tubes. I am constantly forced to try buying Acne products from the US as my inept countries Pharmaceutical industry has taken all Benzoyl Peroxide products out of UK stores, something to do with EU legislation . They probably think that I am going to poison myself by eating the chemicals!&lt;br /&gt;Benzoyl Peroxide is the ONLY product that works against Acne. I told a Uk supplier of Benzoyl Peroxide Cream who were stopping their product in &#x27;Boots Ltd&#x27; that I don&#x27;t need them anymore as I can get all I wish from America. Including Flesh covered Clearasil for covering spots. UK Marketing don&#x27;t realise that you need to clear up spots quickly. All UK non-Benzoyl Peroxide items are useless. Thank you for shipping to the UK. Some of your Benzoyl rivals do not.</li>
    <li> Within a week of using my skin was visibly cleaner.</li>
    <li> Great price for 10%.  VERY good value!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s the only acne spot treatment that works for me. I dab it on at night, I wake up in the morning and it&#x27;s dried up. My face is clear from acne since I&#x27;ve been using this product.</li>
    <li> Benzoyl peroxide is a very effective acne treatment. I use this on my sweet bull dog&#x27;s facial &#x27;acne.&#x27; I know there is a specific term for this in dogs but I don&#x27;t recall it at the moment. He has terrible acne on his face and chin that pops open and remains open a lot of the time. This helps to control the growth of bacteria and keep the open pimples from getting reinfected. This allows his face time enough to heal itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This won&#x27;t work on the big deep cystic pimples. You need Acutane for those. However, this is a great product to get rid of other kinds of acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, 10% is pretty high to start out with. You want to use the lowest effective dose to minimize the side effects that can come along with using this product. Side effects can include things like dry or irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend starting with 5% first to see how your skin does and then stepping up if necessary. This is one of those cases where more is not necessarily better. Also, when you start out, try only using it every other night.  You don&#x27;t want to fix one problem just to create another.</li>
    <li> absolutely fantastic product :)</li>
    <li> Works much better than the B-peroxide you normally find in the store. My acne is under much better control and I&#x27;m saving money.</li>
    <li> It really keeps my skin clear and I swear by this product! It really works. I notice a difference when I use it regularly and when I don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great for my teenage son.  He uses is daily and it has helped with his break-outs.  Good price for a very good product!</li>
    <li> Works great overnight for stubborn pimples. I use 2-3x a week to avoid the dryness.</li>
    <li> Works great, no reason to pay the money for proactive.</li>
    <li> It was a really great price, but I don&#x27;t believe this product has 10% benzoyl peroxide. There is no expiry date on it so maybe its just old? I&#x27;m not sure, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything at all. No improvement in skin condition. Also no side effects that would indicate benzoyl peroxide (i.e. no burning, drying, discolouration of fabrics, etc.). Next time, I would spend a few extra dollars to go with a trusted brand.</li>
    <li> It works.  Best cream for zapping acne quickly.  Use in small doses as dries skin and also watch staining on colored materials if skin comes into contact with them.  I have stained a blue pillowcase using this product overnight...but its worth it for clear skin!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  My son who has very bad acne started using this and within 3 days his face was totally clear.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Stop wasting money in expensive acne treatments.  NOTHING works better than Benzoyl Peroxide.  I have used a million products and this is the most effective and least expensive.</li>
    <li> Have to use it at least everyday for full effect, washes are not better than gel or cream products because they do not stay on your skin long enough to have a beneficial effect</li>
    <li> Exact same ingredients in same amounts as the new, very expensive, Clearasil ultra. Works great too! I have some pretty persistanet pimple problem and this really helps.</li>
    <li> No complaints. Good product at a good price. Just like any other plain peroxide I&#x27;ve ever tried for controlling acne.</li>
    <li> This product works like any other 10% Benzoyl Peroxide. 4 1/2 oz would run nearly $23 at the supermarket so it was a good score for $9.</li>
    <li> Great buy on a great product.</li>
    <li> I always buy the 3 pack when I&#x27;m running low. Works very well!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because of all the positive reviews it was given.  So glad I did.  First, it was shipped out within 2 days even though I chose standard shipping so I was really happy that I had this product in hand to use a few days after ordering.  I used it at night before bed and the next morning my problem areas were completely, 100 percent cleared up.  I have tried several different acne medications and have never seen results as amazing as the results I got from using this product.  You also can&#x27;t beat the value you receive.  You&#x27;re getting 3 tubes for the price that you&#x27;d pay for one tiny tube at the drug store.  This acne medication is a must for anyone who has problem areas that they are trying to clear up as soon as possible.  I was really impressed!</li>
    <li> Speedy Delivery, product as advertised, would recommend highly.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that works for my acne. I&#x27;ve had acne since the 5th grade. Thankfully with time my acne has reduced greatly but I still have spots that pop up whenever I don&#x27;t use this.</li>
    <li> Great price. Does not seem to work as well as &amp;#34;Zapzyt,&amp;#34; though. But then Zapzyt costs almost as much for a 1 oz. tube.</li>
    <li> OMG THIS IS THE SOLUTION FOR ACNE! If you have bad severe moderate acne or jus looking for a spot treatment, this is what you need. My skin is not sensitive to benzoyl peroxide but this stuff works. You will have dry flakey red skin but after you exfoliate after 2 week, seriously you will have NEW skin. I love. I been only using it for about a month and I have no new pimples.</li>
    <li> This product is the best I&#x27;ve used for treating my acne.  Doesn&#x27;t feel messy or make my skin as nearly as dry as other products like clearasil.</li>
    <li> Good stuff and it lasts long.</li>
    <li> The best acne medication ever!!!! I absolutely love this product!!! It works perfectly on me!!! I always get acne cysts caused by stress, anxiety &amp; depression!!! I tried many products before but I never was 100% satisfied until I found this medication!!! :] It&#x27;s so effective &amp; make the acne go away so fast!!! &amp;lt;3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this product for people that have severe acne too!!! If you have a severe acne use this product for a 3 months treatment, everyday use, 3 times per day. Then when your acne is gone, use it only if you get pimples, put some cream only in the pimples everyday until they are gone!!! :] Something very important, you have to be patient if you are doing the 3 months treatment!!! Also, don&#x27;t wear any make up to cover the acne while you are doing the treatment, the face have to be clean with the product on only!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this product &amp; I hope it helps many people that are dealing with acne!!! :] *Blessings*</li>
    <li> This product is ok it doesn&#x27;t work that well for my skin but might work well for others. But the amount of cream in the tubes will last pretty long.</li>
    <li> I think this works better tan the oxy-10, it doesn&#x27;t clogs the pores and goes on very smoothly. Quick drying, works overnight. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is the best Benzoyl Peroxide product that I have found.  The tubes are large, and the cream comes out easily.</li>
    <li> works well good value for 3</li>
    <li> Great price and delivered quickly....</li>
    <li> It works! I&#x27;ve had acne since I was young and have lived with it for over a decade now. After using it every night after cleansing my face is pretty much acne-free except some old acne scars. It has worked for me when nothing else did. I started with the 5% which I would recommend trying first before moving onto this 10% one. I realized that the 5% was working but it didn&#x27;t completely control some of the small breakouts, which is when I decided to switch it for a higher percentage.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Would be better if one could buy them individually, but I guess it&#x27;s like a Costco buy. All in all, a good buy and great price!</li>
    <li> This works so well. Very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Hate how it turns white after applying and I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference other than the fact that it&#x27;s making my skin worse. Will not be wasting money on a product like this again.</li>
    <li> OMG....I&#x27;m still like wawouuuuu.I&#x27;ve been crying with my acne for 4months and I&#x27;ve used all expensive products. Rencently I was going to try the peel.I think twice and told to myself that I&#x27;m going to be a zombie since the acne, black head is all around my face.This is a miracle product believe it or not...&lt;br /&gt;I shop on amazon like a little store next door, but I&#x27;ve never post a review before.&lt;br /&gt; I didn&#x27;t want people to see me because when you looked at my face, you don&#x27;t want to look at me twice.My boyfriend told me that I need to stop spending a lot on acne products because my face is getting worse.I went to a small pharmacy and they were sorry to see how my face was ....  They asked me to try this product &amp;#34;5%&amp;#34;.I said please let me go with &amp;#34;10&amp;#34; because I was so devasted, lost of self confidence. . .After 2days of usage,my boyfriend look at my face and said that this product is a miracle. I said thanks Lord, now I&#x27;m going to be a real person.This is 1week today...no pimple,fade acne, no new acne, and the blacks head are going away.  Redness, dryness sometimes sensation of burning, peeling. ....but hooo if you have severe acne please I believe that you  should try this product, don&#x27;t waist your money buying expensive products.</li>
    <li> I had a breakout and purchased some Neutrogena 2.5% cream (0.75 oz for $5.50 at WM) and it was ok but not strong enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I ordered this for a fraction of the per volume price compared to the name brand and it was a major, immediate improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will dry out your skin to the point of flaking and it will bleach fabrics so you must use wisely.</li>
    <li> Dried out my pimples quickly.</li>
    <li> Be careful since this can really dry your skin in span of couple days. Make sure to moisturize afterwards. Otherwise, good use for daily basis. Use it at night though</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price.</li>
    <li> I was buying a name brand for years (the orange tube not sure name) via subscribe &amp; save when Amazon ran out so I bought this, less expensive generic.  I will not be ordering the other kind again.  This one feels nicer applying it, the results seem the same (in fact my heat rash for the last few months finally cleared up when I switched) and best of all:  It doesn&#x27;t bleach my pillow cases.</li>
    <li> Let me tell you about this Acne cream by far its the best out in the market. I&#x27;ve been battling acne for years, I&#x27;m currently in college and I still have a bit of acne but its going away this cream has controlled my acne. I remember not wanting to do any activities because of my terrible acne face. I went through so many treatments including Kaiser care and many foreign recommendations and nothing is compared to this priceless acne medication.</li>
    <li> it really works,my son&#x27;s acne is getting better,doesn&#x27;t have that much break out now,he tried sulfur cream,neutrogena,and aveeno acne cream,so far this works best</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really not sure how to take this product.  I&#x27;ve been getting adult acnes for a few months now for no apparently reason and I finally got around to getting this.  From reading other reviews, it worked out well for most people.  For me, I&#x27;m not so sure.  It definitely dried up the acnes but the appearance/presence of it is still there (brown spots) I&#x27;ve been using this a couple times a day for about 3 days now and it turned my skin pretty red.  I understand this is one of the possible side effects and I&#x27;d be ok with it if it cleared up the acnes but it really didn&#x27;t except that everything&#x27;s turn brown/dark brown except my skin (it turned red).  When I heard \\&quot;cleared up\\&quot;, this wasn&#x27;t what I had in mind.  Now I look like I&#x27;ve been punched in the face a couple of times along with pretty visible brown spots where the acnes are.  Maybe my skin is extra sensitive but it didn&#x27;t seem to clear up any acnes as far as I can tell.</li>
    <li> Works well. Blemishes are reduced in size quickly.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this it was listed in the green package, but came in the purple packing. I was told the company changed the packing...well it seems it changed the product too. I compared it to the tube I already had (green one) and the ingredients were mostly the same, but was missing a few things. The new cream is a waste. Doesn&#x27;t work! Please bring back the old formula! It was the only thing that cleared my pimples up dam near over night. Highly disappointed!</li>
    <li> Great product. Does it&#x27;s job. Leaves skin feeling great. Wash face with Clean &amp; Clean Continuous Control (Purple Bottle) 2x per day, followed by thin layer of this heavenly product across affected areas, lastly use Olay Oil-free face lotion to get the 3 punch combo that works wonders on my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. I used to only be able to get this with a prescription and now it&#x27;s OTC so I love how accessible it is.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 25 and still have bad skin and this works great for my skin</li>
    <li> Works great and is much cheaper than the name brands. Bye bye pimples. My face is gonna be clean! Boom.</li>
    <li> Great value.  Cream goes on clear and works well.  I believe I&#x27;m getting better results using this than any other product I have used over the years.</li>
    <li> Ever since I started using this I rarely get a pimple, I was trying proactive before this and it was not effective.</li>
    <li> This worked really good!, just stay out of the sun when you use !</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even remember ordering this.  Tossed it in my &amp;#34;home pharmacy&amp;#34; and forgot about it.  Tried it one night, and it is actually very good.  It is mightily difficult to find a good acne medication (adult onset acne, annoying and stubborn!)  Expect to be ordering this again.  I have various Benzoyl Peroxide products.  This is 10% which doesn&#x27;t seem like much; BUT less is better oftentimes with this type of medication.  Even 5% is actually best, imo.  I will periodically use this after 5% face wash.</li>
    <li> It completely work on me but it doesnt work on my sister&#x27;s skin. I personally love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cursed with a bad complexion all my life. I am 60 and still get breakouts on my scalp. Since I now space my head, it&#x27;s not a very attractive site. This stuff really works.  Started using it daily and in about two weeks, no more breakouts. If I stop using it for about two weeks, the breakouts will start again.    I use the once a day at night before bed.</li>
    <li> wow! This stuff really works!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Works almost overnight for me. I had severe acne. I washed my face with the benzoyl peroxide 10 face wash then I apply this every night and morning. Works wonders! I used to hate standing in front of the mirror, now I can&#x27;t stop looking at my fresh, clean, acne free looking face. Omg! I recommend it. Add it to ur benzoyl facial wash.&lt;br /&gt;Ps: ur face will be dry for about a week, but it completely normal, while drying up the acne, the old dead skin will go away after a week, you will appreciate the result.</li>
    <li> better than the cvs and rite-aide brands as the gel is a slightly thicker consistency.  Otherwise, it works just like any other 10% benzoyl peroxide solution</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that keeps my face at bay; this is a good brand that works for me. As long as you moisturize when necessary, you should be okay.</li>
    <li> Work as good as named brand products.  Delivery was fast and the product cost cheaper than name brand.</li>
    <li> works like any other pimple medicine, but the value and stiff of this one is greta!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter after comparing ingredients to other popular (and more expensive) products.  She is happy with it and we are definitely seeing a difference in her acne.</li>
    <li> Good product for minor acne, not greasy, it works well.</li>
    <li> thanks this good product</li>
    <li> It do the work but you have to used every day</li>
    <li> Works just like the expensive stuff!</li>
    <li> Not as great as the reviews claimed. Did not work for my teenagers</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had blackheads from living in high humidity for years. I&#x27;ve tried lots of things and my face always gets scrubbed but nothing really worked. This stuff made the annoying things history.</li>
