      <li>Hope that helps :)</li>
      <li>I was so glad to get these in the mail.</li>
      <li>perfect for  any regular plate.</li>
      <li>i love the quality i have 2 filled already</li>
      <li>These ones are better than the one I received free.</li>
      <li>I received a free one when I bought a Pueen stamping plate set and wanted to get more when my plate collection grew.</li>
      <li>and I can store them easily.</li>
      <li>so easy to find what plate you want to use and easy to locate your plates</li>
      <li>The free one spins the plates out of the holders with one screw holding the plastic sheets.</li>
      <li>Worth the price!</li>
      <li>I wanted a more portable carry case for certain plates and these fit the bill.</li>
      <li>Only qualm is that they can really fit ALOT more holders in each one, 20 more pages easily.</li>
      <li>Colors are true to what is pictured.</li>
      <li>Pretty good other than that</li>
      <li>... decisions, decisions ;)</li>
      <li>I love how organized everything is, and I use the different colors to separate my plates by brand.</li>
      <li>Cute, practical holders that fit all of my round or hexagonal stamping plates.</li>
      <li>Even though the are synthetic leather they are very well made and the plastic inserts are higher quality.</li>
      <li>please make some for large plates</li>
      <li>Super cute, sturdy enough, each case holds just about one set of plates, plus 1-2 extra, depending on the set.</li>
      <li>and so I can just grab just one and not have it weigh to much.</li>
      <li>I am going to repurchase this product just to have extras for the plates I will most likely buy in the near future.</li>
      <li>So far these are fine, I haven&#x27;t really used but one, the other two I purchased for gifts.  </li>
      <li>Great holders, fits all of my small round plates and the new bundlemonster 2in square plates with room to spare.</li>
      <li>It is nice to have a small case to store, but I think a larger case would be easier to view the plates.  </li>
      <li>I like these because they are not as large as the bigger case book</li>
      <li>Cute durable little cases hold two plates per page (one front and one back).</li>
      <li>It feels like a waste of space when ive filled it up</li>
      <li>The new ones is like a tiny booklet and is held by two screws.</li>
      <li>I read a review for the individual cases that stated these fit Messy Mansion plates...</li>
      <li>The bigger Cheeky round plates (Summer collection) fit into the slots, however they stick out a little, putting them at risk for bending...</li>
      <li>Cons the leather fades onto the outer two clear pages turning them pink and they are stained.  </li>

<li> Pros, they are small and portable.  </li>
<li> The plastic holders are very thin and fragile.</li>

    <li> I was so glad to get these in the mail. The slots are wide so they&#x27;re big enough to hold even my octagon-shaped plates. The colors are very cute. I have nothing bad to say about these at all! I am going to repurchase this product just to have extras for the plates I will most likely buy in the near future.</li>
    <li> Great holders, fits all of my small round plates and the new bundlemonster 2in square plates with room to spare. Most holders are 5-10 dollars so this is a good buy.</li>
    <li> perfect for  any regular plate. only thing I would change is the clarity of the pages plastic.  please make some for large plates</li>
    <li> I have a lot of discs for nail stamping. I made up a folder but it wasn&#x27;t a great holder. THESE are great. Hold several discs and I can store them easily.</li>
    <li> I received a free one when I bought a Pueen stamping plate set and wanted to get more when my plate collection grew. These ones are better than the one I received free. The free one spins the plates out of the holders with one screw holding the plastic sheets. It doesn&#x27;t seem sturdy. The new ones is like a tiny booklet and is held by two screws. These ones also have larger plastic sheets to hold larger plates.&lt;br /&gt;I would repurchase if I ever need more.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping , nothing missing or damaged. I got these for my niece for Christmas along with 3-4 sets of different plates. Pros, they are small and portable.  Cons the leather fades onto the outer two clear pages turning them pink and they are stained.  Pretty good other than that</li>
    <li> It is nice to have a small case to store, but I think a larger case would be easier to view the plates.  The plastic holders are very thin and fragile.</li>
    <li> Bought for a friend of mine. Cute durable little cases hold two plates per page (one front and one back). Construction of case is solid/sound. Colors are true to what is pictured. Only complaint is that if only one plate is put in a page, the plate can sometimes slide out of pocket at top...not a deal breaker for me or my friend though. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> These were very cute and worked great! It was nice to have the variety of colors and they are great quality!</li>
    <li> I wanted a more portable carry case for certain plates and these fit the bill. Only qualm is that they can really fit ALOT more holders in each one, 20 more pages easily. It feels like a waste of space when ive filled it up and there is a finger width of extra space for them to jingle around in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit To Add - These holders fit a good variety of brands from Bundle Monster, Winstonia, M Series (Konad knock offs), Salon Express, QA Series (octagon shape from China), and RuiZ Series (also octagon). Hope that helps :)</li>
    <li> I like how three of them came in a pack. To put your stamping plates in and yes i would get it again.</li>
    <li> Super cute, sturdy enough, each case holds just about one set of plates, plus 1-2 extra, depending on the set. Now to make the decision if I want to organize the plates by theme or by tips/full nail/small design... decisions, decisions ;)</li>
    <li> i ordered 2 sets of these and i love them!!!! i love the quality i have 2 filled already and i will do my best to load all them!!! so easy to find what plate you want to use and easy to locate your plates love love!!!!</li>
    <li> These hold my Bundle Monster nail stamping plates perfectly. Perfect way to organize them!</li>
    <li> I like that these cases are small and can hold a standard size set of plates that are round, like preen or Konad.  I like these because they are not as large as the bigger case book and so I can just grab just one and not have it weigh to much.</li>
    <li> These cases are the perfect size and fit for nail stamping plates.  The plates stay in the holders, and with the multiple cases you can organize your plates.  These are a great buy!</li>
    <li> I read a review for the individual cases that stated these fit Messy Mansion plates... Unfortunately this was not the case for me. The bigger Cheeky round plates (Summer collection) fit into the slots, however they stick out a little, putting them at risk for bending... So unless you&#x27;re careful, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest these for the Cheeky Summer collection either. The cases fit octagon plates nicely though! Hope this helps someone!</li>
