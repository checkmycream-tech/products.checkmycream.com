      <li>I love this product as well as the rest of their contact-solution line for RGPs.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Too expensive for the small amount you get.</li>
    <li> I was diagnosed with keratoconus about six years ago. It is a degenerative eye disease that changes the shape of your cornea (from spherical to cone-shaped). The result is very distorted vision, and wearing contacts becomes difficult. I started wearing hard (RGP) contacts earlier this year, as a treatment and to counteract the keratoconus. My vision improved, but eye pain and dryness intensified.  The cleaning solution and wetting drops my doctor recommended were okay, but I was having to use the drops several times a day. I decided to look for something better. After reading the reviews of the Lobob Optimum products, I decided to give it a shot. I am so glad I did. I noticed a difference the first day I used it. I started with the cleaning solution (being mindful of all the warnings to rinse my contacts after using the solution). My contacts felt cleaner/ moister as soon as I put them in. I ended up using the rewetting drops just once in 8 hours. That was a welcome relief. I had to use my old drops at least once an hour.  I have been using the Lobob products for 3 months now. I am grateful to Amazon for carrying them, as I cannot find any of these items in my local stores. I hope Amazon will consider adding the Care System as well as the Wetting and Rewetting drops to the Subscribe and Save Program.  If you wear RGP contacts, and especially if you have keratoconus, believe me when I say you will not find better wetting and rewetting drops.  These drops feel 100% better than any other drops.  My eyes feels more moist and less gritty.  I can also wear my contacts longer, because they are more comfortable.    **IF YOU HAVE KERATOCONUS, TRY THESE DROPS, AND ALSO TRY THE COMPLETE CARE SYSTEM.  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.</li>
    <li> Threw away all Boston and drugstore brand to use Lobob products exclusively.&lt;br /&gt;Made an immediate improvement in RGP coating problem.</li>
    <li> I used to use clear care. I switched to optimum and the difference is worth the cost. My hard lenses are super comfortable.</li>
    <li> So far, works very well. Sometimes I put a drop in each eye during day, but not all the time. Works better that B&amp;L.I would reorder and recommend.</li>
    <li> This was a recommendation from my doctor and it took me a while to try it  but it along with the CDS are fabulous.  My contacts are so comfortable now.</li>
    <li> I have worn hard contacts for over 40 years. I started having problems this year. Constantly rewetting and washing the contacts all day long. Blurry vision and mucus in my eyes. I thought I was having a bad allergy year or my new contacts were the problem. I found out online that other people were having a problem with the new improved Boston Solution. Tried the Lobob products and problem solved. Sent an email to the Boston Solution company and never heard back from them. Lobob has me as a customer now.</li>
    <li> The Optimum Extra Strength Contact Lens Cleaner is the best cleaner I&#x27;ve ever used.  The only one to be able to get allergy and protein deposits off.  I would recommend it to anyone.  I wear gas permeable lenses.</li>
    <li> great for gas permeable contact lens</li>
    <li> great eye drops for a cheap price.  walgreens sells them for about $15.00, much cheaper.  arrived quickly.  thanks so much!</li>
    <li> This contact wetting solution is GREAT.  The WRW solution increases the wearing-time of my RGP contacts by several hours.  I love this product as well as the rest of their contact-solution line for RGPs.</li>
    <li> After trying several other wetting and rewetting products for gas permeable lenses, I found that this one worked the best and felt the most comfortable in my eyes.</li>
    <li> These drops are miraculous!!  They make wearing my RGP lenses so easy and very comfortable.  The drops provide excellent cushioning and keep my eyes moist throughout the day with just the one application in the morning.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> This review is really for the whole Optimum by Lobob line. I switched to this at an optometrist&#x27;s recommendation and it&#x27;s helped me keep my RGP lenses much cleaner.   Lobob is great and it can be hard to find, so I was very happy to see it on Amazon with a good price and  Prime shipping.  I hope it continues.</li>
    <li> The fluidity of this wetting solution is the closest I&#x27;ve found to the now-defunct Allergan line.  Other brands are too viscous for me -- I prefer a more watery consistency because it results in immediate clarity when the lens is inserted. With the more gooey liquids it takes a while for my vision to clear.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn RGP lenses for 16 years, and around two years ago I was contemplating having to give up my contacts and just go with my glasses full-time, due to constant irritation, deposits, and blurry vision.  I thought it was due to my long-term wear and ever worsening vision (I&#x27;m a -9.75), but turns out it was due to the Boston solutions I was using.  I tried just about every variety of Boston with the same issues, mainly horrible protein deposits, even with religious use of the protein deposit remover.  I happened to run across the Lobob solution and will NEVER use Boston again.  My contacts are comfortable again, and I never have deposits and the blurry vision that goes with them now.  I use both the WRW and the CDS.  I also have the ESC, but rarely if ever use it.  I generally buy it locally at Walgreens or Meijer, but it&#x27;s good to know it is also available here at Amazon if for some reason it becomes unavailable here.</li>
    <li> Optimum Wetting &amp; Rewetting Drops are not available thru my eye doctor and are not easy to find in stores.  My eye doctor highly recommends it and I have been using it successfully for years. Ordering on line is the only way I can obtain it and it&#x27;s easily done thru Amazon. Living in a dry climate requires a great contact lens product, and Optimum is it.</li>
    <li> I love the drops because they work! The drops last and feel good when used. I also use them to re-wet when my contacts feel dry.</li>
    <li> Due to the fact that most people now use soft contacts there are fewer and fewer products for those of us using rigid gas permeables.  Lobob still makes a full complement of products for us though, and of all the different ones I have tried, this line is the best.  The comfort of this wetting solution compared to Boston&#x27;s for example, is remarkable.  I literally put a single drop on the lens and insert it into my eye and barely can feel it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are soaking and cleaning solutions that are companions to this solution rather than the all-in-one approach other manufacturers have taken.  This is slightly more costly but in my opinion it is infinitely better.</li>
    <li> These drops have definitely helped the problems I have had w/ RGP contact lenses caused by dry eyes.  Had tried other brands that could be used in the eye while wearing contacts, but still had problems keeping the lenses clean.  I put a drop or 2 of the Optimum WRW on each lens before inserting, and also use the drops in my eye during wearing time.  It has definitely helped to keep the lenses clean. Am also using the Optimum \\&quot;extra strength cleaner\\&quot; to clean my lenses before storing.  First learned of these products when my ophthalmologist gave me a sample.  Somewhat difficult to find---try Walgreen&#x27;s or Amazon.</li>
    <li> They were a new kind of contact cleaner for my contacts.  I have used them for several months and like it.</li>
    <li> My wife has tried others and keeps coming back to this.</li>
    <li> Effective and not viscous like the leading brand.  Would never go back!  Rapid delivery.  Pricey but worth it.  Best available product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this solution since I started wearing gas permeable contacts, at least 15 years ago. The owner of the lab that made my contacts recommended Optimum solutions, and the lab I use now also recommends them. The wetting solution cushions well, feels soothing, and -- most importantly -- doesn&#x27;t have a sticky, thick feeling.  I&#x27;ve special ordered these solutions when I can&#x27;t find them in stores.  Sometimes, when I take my contacts out at the eye doctor, they don&#x27;t have a bottle of this brand, and I&#x27;ve learned to ask for plain saline instead, because I hate the other brand&#x27;s syrupy feeling in my eyes.  All of the Optimum solutions are essential to me.</li>
    <li> The bottles are too small and I have to rewet my contacts frequently due to lack of lubrication of the solution.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use Boston, Optimum, and Menicare products. (Don&#x27;t go for menicare...too expensive. Optimum is the same line of products that you can find cheaper prices for) I have since developed a sensitivity/allergic reaction to Boston solution; however, Optimum products work perfectly. (My eyes can be extremely sensitive if something gets in them that they don&#x27;t like). These WRW drops really allow me to wear my contacts for a very long time, much longer than using any other rewetting products. I tried Refreach contacts...they&#x27;re OK but they&#x27;re pricey and the effect isn&#x27;t as long lasting. These Optimum WRW drops are a perfect combo of rewetting comfort without being too \\&quot;goopy\\&quot;. There really isn&#x27;t anything better out there for RGP users, in my opinion. Have to buy them online though, otherwise you&#x27;ll easily drop over $12 for one bottle, which is excessive. Buying these online can save you at least $2 per bottle, and if you are a strategic shopper buying in bulk from other places can save you upwards of $4 per bottle, which is a superb deal.</li>
    <li> This my wife&#x27;s favorite solution system and it is easier and cheaper to buy it in bulk on Amazon. You may have to shop around some to find a seller with a good sale but this stuff is pretty expensive in the drugstore and worth the search for a better price.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Saved me from quitting wearing lenses.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It helps stretch out my wear time on my contacts and seems to make my contacts in general more comfortable to wear. I would definitely recommend the Lobob Optimum line of products for the hard contact lens wearer.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product line and works well with my RPG lenses.  I do wish that it was more available in the stores vs online.</li>
    <li> I tried this product over the Boston Multipurpose solution. I use RGP hard lenses and I am going back to Boston. This product does not really wet my lenses. It goes on and does not feel like it is coating the lenses at all. The Boston solution has a nice slippery texture to it. I would never buy this again nor recommend it.</li>
    <li> As it was descripted in the title, it can wet and rewet eyes so that make I use contact lens more comfortably.</li>
    <li> very good for hard contact lenses</li>
    <li> Bought these for use with RGP lenses after reading some rave reviews online. Tried it for 2 months and eye irritation and dry eyes did not go away. This is not the end all for contacts users.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been about two days that I received and stared to use this product.  I purchased the CDS and the ReWetting solutions.  I have already seen a great improvement in my RGPs.  I, like many, have been using RGPs for over 35 years and started to get very itchy eyes.  Since I was in need of replenishing my solution decided to research other products for my contact lenses.  I was so glad to have found the optimum solutions.  I just hope these solutions will continue to be available.  Definitely recommended...</li>
    <li> My favorite contact solution!!!Thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn gas-permeable hard-contact lenses for 40+ years.  This product is a perfect replacement for those who could only use Barnes-Hind wetting solution (this must be their formula).  I wear my contacts for about 14+ hours a day.  My eyes rarely dry out and my lenses rarely get &amp;#34;cloudy&amp;#34;.  I just can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this Lobob product.  And it lasts a long time, too.</li>
    <li> LOBOB makes the best solutions for gas perm lenses.</li>
    <li> Really great wetting drops for hard, gas permeable lenses.  I had not heard about this brand but decided to try it.  I was happy I did.  The re-wetting drops kept my eyes moisturized when I needed it and made my contacts feel much more comfortable.  It&#x27;s also economical and cheaper than the Boston drops which are half the size for the same price.  If you are looking for wetting drops for hard lenses, I would highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing. great lubricant for my contacts. My eyes are never dry when I use this. Better then any other rewetting drop I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find the brand locally. I use this line all the time, and endorse the product for semi-permiable contact lens wearers.</li>
    <li> Eye doctor insists that Optimum products for hard, gas permeable contact lenses are the best.  He is the second eye care professional to recommend Optimum.  I use the full set of cleansing, storage and wetting solutions.  Comfort while wearing contacts is superior to other products -- and I&#x27;ve been wearing contacts for almost 70 years.</li>
    <li> The best wetting solution for gas perms.  Recommended by my optometrist.  Not found in many store, but can be found on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I am a person with many allergies, and have had hard or gas permeable lenses since the 1960s.  These are the only drops that don&#x27;t make my eyes itch and really allow the lenses to remain comfortable all day long.  I use Lobob&#x27;s storage solution, too  --  for overnight. I&#x27;ve tried others (like Boston) -- don&#x27;t work!  Lenses cloud up immediately.</li>
    <li> The Lobob Optimum WRW drops are pretty watery and not viscous like Boston conditioning solution. While they are gentler on the eyes than the Boston conditioning solution (maybe due to less preservatives), they just don&#x27;t cushion my RGPs as long. I&#x27;ve used up 2 bottles of WRW so far and this has been my experience. I apply the WRW drops pretty generously after the CDS soaking step, like 3 drops on each side of each lens, but my eyes still feel scratchy and uncomfortable before 4 hours have passed - in which case, I need to apply more WRW drops. On the other hand, the Boston Advance conditioning solution keeps my lenses cushioned and moist for at least 12 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, the best RGP solution combination is Lobob ESC cleaner and Boston Advance conditioning solution. (Lobob ESC is much stronger and effective than Boston cleaner and you won&#x27;t need an additional protein enzyme cleaner with it.) The good thing with this combo is that you won&#x27;t need to spend extra time rinsing off the CDS solution and applying WRW drops in the morning, like you would if you went with the entire Lobob line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose I&#x27;ll keep WRW drops just in case something gets in my eye while wearing RGP lenses, but now I don&#x27;t have a need for them.</li>
    <li> Great product for hard contact lenses.</li>
    <li> Thought I&#x27;d have to give up my gas permeable hard lenses due to dryness. Then I began using Lobob Optimum Wetting Drops and can wear my lenses all day.</li>
    <li> I have had a difficult time finding a contact lens solution that works well without irritating my eyes. This product is great! My contacts stay clear all day.</li>
    <li> I wear gas permeable lenses and had been using another product for cleaning and wetting and had recently experienced fogging on the lenses.  My optometrist gave me a sample of the Optimum wetting and cleaning solutions and the fogging disappeared.  I will be using this product from now on.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fog up your lenses, like some other brands, keeps them clear, lasts for a while too,would definetly buy again</li>
    <li> I have been looking all the soaking solutions for contact.  My contact provider recommended to be that I use ONLY &amp;#34;Barns Hind&amp;#34; solution,  this was in the year 1958 in Boston, Mass.  I used Barns Hind for 55 years with no problems, then the company stopped making contact soaking solution.  Never had a problem with them.  The alternate solutions on the market that I tried all have a problem.  The contacts tend to &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; up after a few hours of wearing, or when trying to read a computer screen, or looking out on really bright days.  I have tried every brand that Amazon has and used the brand recommended by the eye doctor.  None completely solve the problems.  The Lobob version is the best, from my research, but occasionally does have the problem.  One could say it is because I am getting older.  Just fully that the &amp;#34;gunking&amp;#34; started the month Barns quit making their produce.  Phoned Barns, nice lady on the phone apologized for the company dropping the product.  She did not know why.  Do not try Google &amp;#34;Barns Hind&amp;#34;  you will get a web site that &amp;#34;has&amp;#34; the product, but it is never available.  Good Luck.</li>
    <li> The picture shows the item comes in a box like at a drug store.  My bottles arrived in a plastic bag with no box or instructions.  The picture is misleading.</li>
    <li> After storing in Lobob CDS for the nigh, rubbingt and rinsing in the morning, I use this to insert into eyes.  No sting, no film or fog, and the best rewetting solution available for gas perm lenses.</li>
    <li> Kind of pricey but a must have for people who wear hard lenses and have sensitive or dry eye problems.</li>
    <li> My Doctors have recommended these for my gas permeable lenses ONLY...other products do NOT work and can damage the lense!  I have tried Boston since that is the only one we can find on the open market, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well and ends up making me take the lense out and starting all over again.</li>
    <li> I have gas permeable contact lenses and have use this product for many years (as well as other Lobob products).  I find Lobob products superior to other contact lens products designed for gas permeable lenses.</li>
    <li> AAA product. highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Nice to find the  products I need for my hard contacts - thanks!</li>
    <li> Not satisfied with what I was using.  Decided to try something different.  This work well and are a little cheaper.</li>
    <li> Delivery was on time but the product date had expired.  Since it was just the previous month, I will use it but will be hesitant to order something like this again.  I have been buying from a local store and will go back to doing that.&lt;br /&gt;The product line is a very good contact solution.  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found for cleaning RGP contacts.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing hard contacts for 44 years and these drops are the best!  They make my eyes feel very, very comfortable.  In fact I want to order a bottle for my purse so that the drops are with me 24/7.</li>
    <li> For years I had used Aquify drops for my Ortho-K lenses (RGP worn overnight to correct vision). Aquify was discontinued last year so I tried Optimum based on the reviews here. These rewetting drops did not work well for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One problem I had was the physical size of the bottle.  At 1 oz the bottle is rather large and the hole at the top is a little too big. When I turned the bottle upside down the drops would come out without a squeeze. Also the drops were somewhat too large and would cause too much run-off from my eye with just a single drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drops were slightly too thick (viscous) for me which didn&#x27;t seem to allow my lenses to sit correctly. I tried these for three days and each day when I woke up and took the lenses out my vision wasn&#x27;t as sharp as it normally is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I was allergic to one of the ingredients because these drops made my eyes sting a little. The irritation wasn&#x27;t as strong as I have felt when the lenses are too dry or there something else wrong to make my eye turn a little red but there was a definite slight, persistent burning sensation. I would feel the slight discomfort for the 30 minutes or so it took me to fall asleep. In the morning there was no discomfort but when I used the drops to take my contacts out I would feel the slight stinging again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned the rest of the Optimum I ordered and I wound up using Blink Contacts rewetting drops.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  After 45 years of wearing hard contacts/gas permeable contacts, I was having a problem with my lenses fogging after about fifteen minutes of placing them in my eyes.  I searched the internet and found this solution.  It is a godsend, and although it is slightly more expensive, I no longer have a problem with wearing my contacts.  I can get it at Walgreens, but it is more expensive than from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing RGP lens for almost 15 years and have tried many different solutions that would make my eyes comfortable wearing contacts for at least 10-12 hours each day. My ophthalmologist suggested I try this a couple of months ago. I am glad I did. This is the best rewetting drop I have ever used. Because of this my eyes do not feel tired even after prolonged contact wear. Earlier I had to use lubricating eye gels before going to bed. After using this I do not feel the need to. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This works good but I don&#x27;t see it being any better that others out there. I don&#x27;t like the bottle as it allows more than one drop at a time to come out and I end up wasting quite a bit.</li>
    <li> I had problems with my contact lens being blurred. I had them polished and checked, but nothing helped until my doctor&#x27;s office suggested I try the Lobob Optimum products.  That is all I use now, and have not had a problem with my contact lens since I started using them.  They are hard to find in stores, so ordering from Amazon is a great solution to that problem.</li>
    <li> I have a generic eye condition called: KERACOTONUS, meaning that because the cornea is in the shape of a cone. it is required to wear special Gas permeable lenses. With the age, the eyes become very causing irritation  and constant pain. My Dr. recommended to switch to the numerous eye products manufactured by Lobob Laboratories.  Since then my lenses are always clean and the joy came back to my life!&lt;br /&gt;Helena Bernal, Ca.</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality wetting solution. No irritation to the eyes whatsoever, and it feels extremely natural, like tears, not ultra-thick like some other brands of wetting solution. Lasts me all day most days. The biggest plus is the better quality ingredients!  However, there was something wrong with this particular wetting drops solution I bought from the seller SlamDunkDeals. It was milky, not clear, and this is not normal for this product. Then, in addition, when I put it onto the contacts, it actually burned my eyes. This never happens to me. I contacted the manufacturer, Lobob Labs, and they sent me out replacements at no charge. The odd thing is that the replacements were the SAME batch/lot # as the defective ones, but the replacements worked fine. I never figured that out.</li>
    <li> Favorite solution to use with my contacts.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping; next day actually. Product in a little bag with the UPC code on the bag; not the bottle; very important! Product instructions included; very important! Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Burns eyes.  Back to Blink&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Wife found that these drops worked much better than her old, national brand. Very happy camper.</li>
    <li> This is so much better than other products I used on my Gas Permeable hard lenses. They are much clearer and I can read at a greater distance</li>
    <li> The drop is easy to control - I&#x27;ve had drops that splatter, double up and are just messy.  The drop is comfortable both in lens to insert, and in suction cup to remove the lens.  I am assuming that they are chemically correct, and physically they are comfortable to use</li>
    <li> After years of Boston products, I started using Lobob Optimum in 2011. Much the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These drops are for wetting and inserting contacts in the morning. Also these WRW drops can be used during the day to treat dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually only one drop is needed for wetting before insertion. During winter months in North Texas, I usually use two drops, as air is much drier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this and the other (CDW) Lobob Optimum product I comfortably can wear my RGB (Rigid Gas Permeable) Contact Lenses about 20 percent longer during the day. That means removing them later in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product shipped timely and arrived undamaged. I like this product and have purchased it more than once and will continue to do so. I have not been compensated for this review. I only have the satisfaction of knowing that maybe, just maybe, I helped someone in say, Duluth, or Farmington. But not Boston. Thanks for reading.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a contact lense wearer for over 20 years. I have to special-order my lense. I also experience dry eye...had it for years due to the length of time I wear my lense daily. This product is the BEST I&#x27;ve ever used among other rewetting solutions...and I&#x27;ve tried soooo many!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE, LOVE this stuff - no burning, stinging or sticky feeling and I only use it once (sometimes twice) a day. Very happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that the price has gone up considerably for the single pack. I decided to check other places and found this at Walgreen&#x27;s for about $10. Best to buy the 2-pack here for better deal.</li>
