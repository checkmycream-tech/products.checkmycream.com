      <li>Smells great - somewhat thin and watery - so absorbs quickly - not for those who need a deep moisturizer</li>

    <li> One of the best hand and body lotions I have ever had. Not a bit greasy and really softens the skin and the fragrances are so pleasant. The shipper did a great job--the lotion was well packaged and arrived in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I was given a sample pack from a friend as a gift and I&#x27;m hooked! So far, vanilla snowflake is my favorite scent and when he looked for a bigger bottle at the local beauty supply store they didn&#x27;t have it.  I want to thank Amazon for having it available to purchase. I purchased 3 of the 6.6 oz. bottles and I couldn&#x27;t resist ordering some of the other scents in 1 oz. bottles. The 1 oz. bottles are really convenient to carry around in your purse. I really like the sweet tea and ginger lily scents.  I do love the fact that you can wash your hands numerous times during the day and that the light fragrance stays on your hands.  I love the lotion because it soaks in instantly and does not let your hands feel greasy.  Also, other lotions I have tried on my dry hands have caused small itchy bumps on my hands and this lotion does not do that to me which I&#x27;m so happy about.  I hope vanilla snowflake is always available to purchase so that I can continue to buy it for years.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it!! She has a 1oz. bottle in her purse and keeps it filled all the time. she would highly recommend it to others. It has a great smell.</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome one of my favorites if you like the smell of vanilla than you would probably like this I did try the travel size first to make sure I liked it the scent isn&#x27;t to strong and leaves my skin smooth I like to use this daily and I have noticed how soft my hands appear softer</li>
    <li> My hairdresser gave me a 1oz. bottle of this lotion at Christmas in a gift bag.  I use it on my hands and it really is the best lotion I&#x27;ve found.  My hands are silky smooth and not oily.  I was really happy to find the lotion in a larger size and bought two bottles.  It smells great, too.</li>
    <li> I got a sample bottle in a gift bag and loved it.  Looked for it on the market and when I couldn&#x27;t find it-went to the internet.</li>
    <li> Smells great - somewhat thin and watery - so absorbs quickly - not for those who need a deep moisturizer but it&#x27;s a nice, light product.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s nice&lt;br /&gt;smells good,&lt;br /&gt;but I have other lotions I like much better and are cheaper,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;put try it you might like it</li>
    <li> OPI Avojuice Skin Quenchers  is by far my favorite brand of body lotion and vanilla snowflake is one of my 2 favorite scents (mango is my other favorite!).</li>
    <li> But it soaks in too fast and doesn&#x27;t quench the dry skin that I get in the winter.  Great for the summer months for a lighter coverage.</li>
    <li> My favorite but why can&#x27;t I purchase more ?</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It smells awesome and people always comment on the scent when I wear it. It is super moisturizing, but doesn&#x27;t give you a greasy feeling. I keep a bottle on my desk at work, various spots in my house, and in my purse. Hands down, favorite lotion!</li>
    <li> THis lotion is light and quick absorbing. Nice light fragrance and really helps with dry hands and skin.&lt;br /&gt;There is no greasy feel, a really great lotion!</li>
    <li> I practically inhale the scent on this lotion.  It not only has a wonderful scent, it is a good moisturizer.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Lovely fragrance and a nice texture.  The bottle provides a nice dispensing mechanism.  I have one i. Each bathroom and the car!</li>
    <li> This product has a very light scent. It is silky and very smooth on the skin. I would recommend this product if you like a vanilla scent.</li>
    <li> This is a soft light vanilla scent but absolutely delicious! I find other people smell it longer on me than I do. I love to use these when I give myself manicures since they have the wonderful non greasy feel. As far as quality, great quality but I use this as my summer lotion since its so light and smooth. I tend to use thicker lotions in the winter when you want that protective layer...this lotion doesn&#x27;t do that. Goes on thin, smooth, absorbs quickly, and leaves your hands and body so soft without feeling greasy. Wonderful for all over body use when your in a rush and immediately need to get dressed, you won&#x27;t stick to your clothing or get slimy if you sweat. As you can see I take a lot of little factors into effect, so I hope this helps, great light summer lotion, not so good for chapped winter skin that needs additional protection.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lotion - leaves my skin soft and I always get compliments on how good I smell.</li>
    <li> very nice lotion -- but a bit pricey for such a small amount when lotion does not go far any way</li>
    <li> Service was very prompt. Lotion smells awesome and feels so good on ones skin.  Ordered three bottles.  Hope this fragrance continues as in will definitely order again!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It was easy to order and I love the scent.It makes your skin feel soft and scented. I will order some m ore when I am out of this order</li>
    <li> Not only does this product smell great, it is a wonderful product. OPI never disappoints. I received it on time and in perfect condition</li>
    <li> This lotion is very silky smooth and absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving an oily feeling.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star rating is because I was somewhat disappointed in the fragrance.  It was very underwhelming - I was hoping for a much stronger scent of the vanilla.  I have had other lotions by OPI Avojuice (for example, Gingerbread - a holiday lotion) and that one blew my socks off.  I would probably use that lotion exclusively if they still made it!  Hint, hint!!!</li>
    <li> the scent is Heavenly, it leaves your skin smooth and soft. I love it and I am so glad I found it with you. I have been looking all ver for this item. Thank you!</li>
