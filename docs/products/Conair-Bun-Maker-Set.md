      <li>Great product, easy to use</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and looks great.</li>
      <li>it looks kind of granny also when its in your hair.</li>
      <li>I used my own bobby pins as well.  </li>
      <li>You really have to get the hair in perfectly, with no creasing, if you want to use it that way.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m guessing you could probably do this on your own though.</li>
      <li>This is so quick and easy when you want to go for a polished, perfect bun.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to put on.</li>
      <li>you will need a LOT more pins than they give you, so if you don&#x27;t have some handy, I&#x27;d suggest ordering a set.</li>
      <li>I already love it, was easy to put in and will be a good</li>
      <li>Coming from a girl who hates to style her hair and barely can make a braid, this thing is great!</li>
      <li>Very cheap so</li>
      <li>Think this product would work better if it came with all the bobby pins that it was suppose to.  </li>
      <li>and it came out way better when she did it for me</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am fairly sure my spouse would recommend this product to others.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>You def will need more bobby pins than supplied in the box.</li>
      <li>I will say this though; the longer your hair is the better the bun will work.</li>
      <li>This is more the fault of my hair, not the donut.  </li>
      <li>Please sell more of these on Amazon.</li>
      <li>This bun maker works so much better.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Needing better instructions I looked for &amp;</li>
      <li>While I love the idea and look of how this buns supposed to look the execution of it</li>
      <li>Although her bun was very low it stayed in perfectly and without hairspray!!</li>
      <li>The product is good quality and I am certain it would take many used to wear this one out.</li>
      <li>: Looks great and professional.</li>
      <li>It is super easy to use!</li>
      <li>So easy</li>
      <li>The pictures make it look easy.  </li>
      <li>Like it so far so good I&#x27;m able to get my bun done with no problem.</li>
      <li>I wish there was a better way to make a full ballerina bun.</li>
      <li>As a bun maker set, it was fine though.</li>
      <li>but I just cut it with scissors and it&#x27;s fine for now.</li>
      <li>Just follow the instructions and you will be fine.</li>
      <li>The item worked great for me, considering I have a long hair, and I love how it comes with a hair tie and bobby pins.</li>
      <li>This product made a huge difference.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel secure when it is placed.</li>
      <li>I used the donut with the four pins included in the kit plus my two spirals, and I had the perfect messy sock bun.</li>
      <li>Great for days when I am short on time!</li>
      <li>What I really love is how fast this item was delivered to me, 5 star for the speed of delivery alone :)</li>
      <li>I feel much more confident now that I have an easy, professional look for work.</li>
      <li>suggest making the bun a lot higher on the top of your head than in the picture, or a lot lower with some teasing at the crown.</li>
      <li>My hair is past my shoulders and it worked perfect.  </li>
      <li>I love the classic chignon bun and this makes it so easy.</li>
      <li>We purchased it for my granddaughter dance recital because she has short hair and when we did the bun it looked really good.</li>
      <li>the weight of the sock was too much when combined with all my hair piled on top as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Easy enough for one person to do on their own.</li>
      <li>I make big bun for special occasions and this dummy helps a lot, cause before I could spend an hour to make it perfect and now it takes only couple of minutes</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing the Con-air Perfect Pony &amp; All In One Styling 5 pieces from Amazon for a future present.</li>
      <li>May be it is done for straight hair, it is not that easy</li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>Definitely  worth purchasing .</li>
      <li>It gives your hair volume and is a lot of fun.</li>
      <li>Very user friendly.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t get it right, even watched a You Tube video on it.</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s hard to make a beautiful bun using this donut if you have layers on your hair.</li>
      <li>It is great for buns up high on your head as well as buns down by the nape of your neck.  </li>
      <li>I was interested in this since a friend had one and loves it.  </li>
      <li>Had to purchase more at my local drug store...</li>
      <li>but when I saw this I thought I would try this first.  </li>
      <li>I looked here first because I have a credit to spend</li>
      <li>First off, throw away the instructions that come with the poof.</li>
      <li>I have thin fine hair, and it works nicely for me.</li>
      <li>The one time that I almost got it to work, the bun was the size of my whole head.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I expect something more small and this is big&lt;br /&gt;.The fabric is good however is too big for my hair.</li>
    <li> I almost always wear my hair (which is think, wavy, and extends couple inches past my shoulders) in a bun and I&#x27;ve never been happy with it (I&#x27;ve always just assumed/hoped that no one was looking that closely at my hair). I thought I&#x27;d give the \\&quot;sock bun\\&quot; idea a try but when I saw this I thought I would try this first.  This product made a huge difference.  It&#x27;s very simple to use, just takes about 10-15 minutes of trial and error to figure out what works for you. I didn&#x27;t read the instructions. I just searched online for videos and reviews.  I&#x27;ve noticed that different people use different methods (on youtube etc.).  I first tried putting the bun maker at the base of my pony tail then wrapping the hair around it and that did not work for me at all. Next, I putting the bun maker over the end of my pony tail just a little bit of the way down and then rolling it down while covering it with my hair. This worked well. Then I secured the bun using the bobby pins that come in the box and a couple of elastics hairbands.  I feel much more confident now that I have an easy, professional look for work.</li>
    <li> This bun holder works perfect! I am the bun queen and I thought this was going to be cumbersome to apply but it was not. It&#x27;s very easy to put on. Just follow the instructions and you will be fine. I will say this though; the longer your hair is the better the bun will work. My hair is a little below my shoulder and I had just enough hair to cover the bun roll.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> I like this product because I am in the process of growing my hair longer, and the bun maker helps me create a bun during this process.  I have shoulder-length, unruly and curly hair.  My hair is almost too thick to use this product, and I fear as it grows longer it will be out of the question.  I used my own bobby pins as well.  It is great for buns up high on your head as well as buns down by the nape of your neck.  The product is good quality and I am certain it would take many used to wear this one out.</li>
    <li> I usually wear my hair in a sock bun and I was looking for something easier to use. I like that this product is like a mesh donut. It comes with some bobby pins that are v shaped and help secure the extra hair around the bun and stay in place. I would recommend this product for anyone looking to wear their hair in a polished and professional bun.</li>
    <li> After looking up videos on Youtube of how to make a sock bun, I finally decided to buy this product instead of actually using a sock. I did not follow the directions on the package because they seemed overly complicated and it was not the way that was shown in the video. My hair is past my shoulders, so not sure if this method would work for shorter hair, but I started by making a ponytail at the top of my head and used a rubber band. Then I placed the ponytail through the donut and slip the donut all the way to the ends. I just rolled my hair around it and then rolled the donut down to the top of my head. If these directions seem confusing, just want a video. I didn&#x27;t even need to use any pins or clips and it stayed in. Coming from a girl who hates to style her hair and barely can make a braid, this thing is great!</li>
    <li> I love this thing!  My hair is past my shoulders and it worked perfect.  It comes with bobby pins (you might need a few more depending on your hair length and type), and a hair band.  I had trouble doing it myself, but I had a friend help me and it came out way better when she did it for me, it&#x27;s hard to see behind your damn head!  I wore it casual but you can certainly dress this up or down depending on the occasion.  Totally worth the price, and if you are good managing your hair behind your head it&#x27;s perfect for those bad hair days, rainy days, or days where you just didn&#x27;t feel like washing your hair that day.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  The instructions are lacking, but you can figure it out.  It gives your hair volume and is a lot of fun.</li>
    <li> Think this product would work better if it came with all the bobby pins that it was suppose to.  Had to purchase more at my local drug store...</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who had very short hair for her dance recital and it worked. It made her look like she had a real bun even though she did not.</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to use and it fits the purpose! However, it&#x27;s hard to make a beautiful bun using this donut if you have layers on your hair.</li>
    <li> I cannot make this thing work. The one time that I almost got it to work, the bun was the size of my whole head.</li>
    <li> Love this purchase! Very happy!! Have been looking for the perfect item and found it! Very pleased with this! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> While I love the idea and look of how this buns supposed to look the execution of it it pretty difficult especially if you have thin hair like myself. It makes it hard to try and cover the whole bun area also the getting hair to stay in with bobby pins is hard as they keep popping back out. I wish there was a better way to make a full ballerina bun.</li>
    <li> very helpful tool to get my daughter&#x27;s curly hair in a bun for her ballet class. It even works with her layers.</li>
    <li> The Bun Maker worked perfect for us.  We have to use it once a week for ballet class.  Helps the hair stay in very well.</li>
    <li> Bought this at Walgreens because I could not find a hairagami there, and it does not work at ALL... I tried twelve different times; my arms were sore, I was frustrated... Ugh.</li>
    <li> I can only review this as a man who purchased this as a present for his spouse. She loves this product and uses this for almost every formal event we attend. Pros: Looks great and professional. Easy enough for one person to do on their own. Cons: Lots of those straight bobby pins are needed, so they get all over the place and usually end up lost or down the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am fairly sure my spouse would recommend this product to others. I will be purchasing the Con-air Perfect Pony &amp; All In One Styling 5 pieces from Amazon for a future present.</li>
    <li> I had seen this advertised as something you could use to set curls while you sleep.  That only worked the first time.  You really have to get the hair in perfectly, with no creasing, if you want to use it that way.  As a bun maker set, it was fine though. I&#x27;m guessing you could probably do this on your own though.</li>
    <li> i like it. as far as a bun maker goes, it does the job. the only qualms I have about it is that after a few uses, some of the mesh material came off of the bun maker but I just cut it with scissors and it&#x27;s fine for now.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel secure when it is placed.</li>
    <li> This is the best bun maker set ever! My daughter has LONG, thick hair that is past her waist, so I dread having to make that &amp;#34;perfect ballerina bun&amp;#34; required for ballet classes and especially recitals. The lower the bun, the harder the task, BUT this year it was a breeze and took a little over 8 minutes (due to length of hair). Needing better instructions I looked for &amp;#34;how to make a low bun&amp;#34; and there is a wonderful video using this item that is super helpful. I have been doing my daughter&#x27;s &amp;#34;dance&amp;#34; hair for over 13 years and this year was the easiest ever! Although her bun was very low it stayed in perfectly and without hairspray!! I did use a few more hairpins than were included but with normal length hair extra pins weren&#x27;t needed, I know this because I used it on two of my nieces since then, both with different hair. This is definitely a must have!</li>
    <li> I regret making this purchase. I tend to wear my hair up and away from my face when i&#x27;m at work and I thought this would help me create a neater bun but it&#x27;s useless. They&#x27;re supposed to give you 4 pins to insert into your bun, I only got three, which by the way are painful and annoying if you have them too close to your scalp and if you don&#x27;t then your hair just falls out. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Instructions were poor, and even though I found better instructions on the internet, this bun maker would not hold my hair in place.  I&#x27;m not talking about even holding it while doing activites, it wouldn&#x27;t even hold under perfect conditions (standing in front of the mirror).  I know that my hair is difficult to hold, but if I spend this much on a product, I like it to work.</li>
    <li> May be it is done for straight hair, it is not that easy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but it is good for tidy hair during school time</li>
    <li> I purchased this to put my daughter&#x27;s hair in a bun for her dance recital.  It worked great!  She has shoulder length hair and it is hard to create a pretty bun with it.  The mesh color matched her hair perfectly, so no one could tell it was in her hair.</li>
    <li> I was interested in this since a friend had one and loves it.  I looked here first because I have a credit to spend but this price seemed high compared to the rest. I went to the local CVS and bought the same one for $4.79.  I would try there or Walgreens (which was out of stock when I looked last) before spending this amount for it.  I already love it, was easy to put in and will be a good \\&quot;do\\&quot; for the gym.</li>
    <li> Like it so far so good I&#x27;m able to get my bun done with no problem. Definitely  worth purchasing .</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully.  It is super easy to use!</li>
    <li> It work perfectly. We purchased it for my granddaughter dance recital because she has short hair and when we did the bun it looked really good.</li>
    <li> You get a pony tail holder and a scruffy thing you&#x27;re supposed to wrap your hair around.  Not any easier,  faster or better than any other old fashioned way if doing it.</li>
    <li> I have the hair styling skills comparable to a 2 year old child and thought his would be an easy way to get something other than a ponytail.. I couldn&#x27;t get it right, even watched a You Tube video on it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Conair Bun Maker Set! I&#x27;ve been using it everyday. It stays in place &amp; it looks so professional. People give me compliments on my look. It&#x27;s so durable, I like the fact that it&#x27;s not spongy but also not too stiff. Please sell more of these on Amazon. I didn&#x27;t look at the direction at all it&#x27;s basically common sense on how to use it.</li>
    <li> its absolutly perfect. I love it. It is easy to use and looks great. Thank you for the great reviews that helped me choose this.</li>
    <li> This was one of the best buys i ever made for my hair. I love the classic chignon bun and this makes it so easy. It always comes out perfect . Total breeze.</li>
    <li> Sock buns are so in right now, but I&#x27;ve tried the traditional sock method and I just can&#x27;t get it! This bun maker works so much better. You just slide the donut to the base of your ponytail, then spread the hair out around it and pin the ends into place. you will need a LOT more pins than they give you, so if you don&#x27;t have some handy, I&#x27;d suggest ordering a set. I really like the Goody Spiral hair pins--they take the place of about 10 bobbys. I used the donut with the four pins included in the kit plus my two spirals, and I had the perfect messy sock bun. So easy and I love it!</li>
    <li> My daughter bought this for herself about a week ago and loves it! Very easy, even if you don&#x27;t read the instructions! The only problem was, she has very thick, long hair, so we needed to contain it with a simple blonde hair net. Very cheap so no problem. I would suggest doing this if you have thick, long hair.</li>
    <li> This is so quick and easy when you want to go for a polished, perfect bun.  It has lasted me the whole day through work and the gym.  Great for days when I am short on time!</li>
    <li> First off, throw away the instructions that come with the poof. They are totally dumb, and instead do a quick google search \\&quot;sock bun\\&quot; for a much better way of using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I used to do the sock bun method, but since I have very long hair (about to my waist) the weight of the sock was too much when combined with all my hair piled on top as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This poofy donut is perfect, very lightweight, and if I accidentally jab a bobby pin into it, the spongy material holds perfectly. The actual sock bun method takes some getting used to, and can be a pain if you have a lot of layers. Practice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest making the bun a lot higher on the top of your head than in the picture, or a lot lower with some teasing at the crown. The mid-length bun shown on the product box is at the perfect spot to pull all your baby hair from the front of your face and give you a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I have a bad hair day, I pop this in and roll my hair up into a high bun. With a bow or added flower, jewel, etc, I have gotten more compliments on this hairstyle than any I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> This little bun maker really helps making the bun easier and holding it in place comfortably and stays all day.</li>
    <li> I want to like this bun maker, but it will not work on my fine/thin hair.  My hair is fine and is not as thick as it use to be.  After I create the bun it does not cover the mesh of the donut.  I have blonde hair and the mesh thing is dark brown so I cannot conceal where the hair cannot cover.  This is more the fault of my hair, not the donut.  I just wish it would work!  If you have fine/thin hair then this may not be best product for you.  Otherwise, great idea for creating a bun with volume!</li>
    <li> This bunmaker works well but is a littler bigger than I like. When my hair was long it ended up looking huge and now that its short, my hair doesn&#x27;t stay put well and it still looks a little large. If thats the look you&#x27;re going for and have medium length hair this will work well.</li>
    <li> I make big bun for special occasions and this dummy helps a lot, cause before I could spend an hour to make it perfect and now it takes only couple of minutes</li>
    <li> I am a dad of a 9 year old ballerina and have a lot of trouble fixing a bun for her when my wife is not home.  So, I looked and looked and found good reviews for this one.  I is easy to use, but the bun will be too big for a little girl&#x27;s head.&lt;br /&gt;Better leave this bun maker for adults.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much success, because my hair is very difficult to style. It&#x27;s thick but fine, and straight, so tends to just slide out of any buns. I&#x27;ve purchased bun-makers in the past and had just that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this worked great! The material clung to my hair without pulling, and putting in a few bobby pins holds it all day. My hair is about the same brown too, so I didn&#x27;t really have to worry about it showing. I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughters prom. Was easy to put in a messy bun type like she wanted and it lasted all night. You def will need more bobby pins than supplied in the box.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get it.  Waste of money.  The pictures make it look easy.  I get to the wrap around and pin and don&#x27;t understand where the pony tail hair is supposed to go.  Not impressed.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Very user friendly.</li>
    <li> The item worked great for me, considering I have a long hair, and I love how it comes with a hair tie and bobby pins. What I really love is how fast this item was delivered to me, 5 star for the speed of delivery alone :)</li>
    <li> Love this thing, has helped me in getting the perfect bun each time. I have thin fine hair, and it works nicely for me.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get it if you have thick hair. I tried it and it would not work and I tried all of the methods of using this</li>
    <li> The instructions tell you to unroll it half way with the fat doughnut towards the end of your pony tail and to roll it down with the hair in it. I found that impossible to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make a pony tail and pull my tail thru the doughnut, and then I fan my hair around the doughnut. Use a hair tie over the donut to the base of your ponytail. Now you can run your finger around the bottom and tuck in the extra hair, I use tiny clear elastic bands to hold it down around the base of the doughnut.</li>
    <li> Not sure how to use it. It is a pain in the ass if you ask me. If your good with hair you might understand it. it looks kind of granny also when its in your hair.</li>
    <li> I love wearing my conair bun maker!! The directions on the back weren&#x27;t super helpful so i watched a video but its still amazing!!</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair and this didn&#x27;t work work for me at all it was a total waits of money so very disappointed</li>
