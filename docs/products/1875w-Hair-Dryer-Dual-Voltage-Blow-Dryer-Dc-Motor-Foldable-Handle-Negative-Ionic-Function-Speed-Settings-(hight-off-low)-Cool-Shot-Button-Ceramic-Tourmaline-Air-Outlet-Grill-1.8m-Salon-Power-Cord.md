      <li>and this dries my hair very quickly.</li>
      <li>It worked fine in the U.S.</li>
      <li>Even though my hair is fine</li>
      <li>I have fine wavy hair that tends to frizz</li>
      <li>Great for domestic travel.</li>
      <li>This is the PERFECT travel hairdryer, it folds &amp; is lighter than my everyday hairdryer.</li>
      <li>The construction feels cheap.</li>
      <li>I read the hairdryers provided by hotels weren&#x27;t powerful, I wasn&#x27;t taking any chances!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s powerful and it looks cool.</li>
      <li>It is pretty powerful for the size!</li>
      <li>It works much better than my old one.</li>

      <li>I gave it a 2 because it works fine on 120 volts, even for thick hair, but I like the one I use at home better.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a great little travel hairdryer UNLESS you actually want to use the dual voltage &amp;#34;feature.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Great hair dryer, not available, would have purchased the second!</li>
      <li>and this really smoothes it out.</li>
      <li>Concentrator doesn&#x27;t stay on very well.</li>
      <li>And I really dislike no temperature option.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a second travel sized, foldable hair dryer with a cool shot option to leave at my boyfriend&#x27;s place.  </li>
      <li>Cheap plastic switch you&#x27;re supposed to turn with a screwdriver requires so much force that it ruins the plastic part instead of switching the switch.</li>
      <li>so it is my new travel BD.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it was somewhere in the small print</li>
      <li>As usual Amazon was FANTASTIC about returning!</li>
      <li>Feels a little cheap.</li>
      <li>I have used the dryer some tiems so far, but it appears to be everything that was advertised.</li>
      <li>I now prefer it to my old ones.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and not too loud.</li>
      <li>I still need to get used to the settings because on one of my dryers the high and low are opposite.  </li>
      <li>It is lightweight and the cold air button is such a great feature( being the color red is also a plus).&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>Very powerful and can be used for traveling to Europe and other foreign countries</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much better some other brands, which are really slow to dry or makes my hair frizzy.</li>

    <li> Very powerful and can be used for traveling to Europe and other foreign countries</li>
    <li> Feels a little cheap. Concentrator doesn&#x27;t stay on very well. Not sure if it is just the this one or not, but in Europe it only worked on &amp;#34;low.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer. It&#x27;s powerful and it looks cool. It&#x27;s great for traveling and if you don&#x27;t have a lot of room to store things.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer! It is compact( fits nicely in my hair tool organizer) it will be perfect for travel and everyday use. It is lightweight and the cold air button is such a great feature( being the color red is also a plus).&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Disappointed that it did not have a draw cord. Like ones where the cord is retractable</li>
    <li> dont buy this its not worth it the price is captivating iwill tell you that from experience but&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the whole deal is not so great when you used it totravil it will give you a bad hairday&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and its terrible to used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;is as close to hostel hair dryer</li>
    <li> As Advertised, Prompt shipment and delivery:Says it all</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer that I was able to use while overseas. I have decided that I like it so much that I prefer to use it at home over my usual dryer. It has a lot of power for being so portable. I really like this a lot!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a second travel sized, foldable hair dryer with a cool shot option to leave at my boyfriend&#x27;s place.  I was hesitant at first because I didn&#x27;t recognize the brand name, but this hair dryer works great.  I&#x27;ve had it for a month and it gives a fairly quick, smooth dry.  It&#x27;s much better some other brands, which are really slow to dry or makes my hair frizzy.</li>
    <li> I must say that I love this hair dryer. It works much better than my old one. I have fine wavy hair that tends to frizz and this really smoothes it out. Even though my hair is fine I have a lot of it and this dries my hair very quickly. My hair also feels healthier. Love this dryer and love the price.</li>
    <li> I loved this hairdryer for the heat and styling. It&#x27;s lightweight and not too loud. Great for domestic travel. I actually like it better than my $150 hairdryer. BUT, the switch for the dual-voltage feature totally wouldn&#x27;t move when I get overseas and needed to change it to 220V. Not even the hotel facilities staff could nudge that thing. Returned it and bought another one because I loved the dryer. SAME THING. Neither one would switch to 220V.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s a great little travel hairdryer UNLESS you actually want to use the dual voltage &amp;#34;feature.&amp;#34; Cheap plastic switch you&#x27;re supposed to turn with a screwdriver requires so much force that it ruins the plastic part instead of switching the switch. Total bummer.</li>
    <li> not much difference between the settings.</li>
    <li> Good dryer, fair price, my wife really likes it.  Great for travel, compact and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Awesome hairdryer that also worked overseas</li>
    <li> This blow dryer was marketed as travel size - it&#x27;s not as compact as I have purchased in the past however it is WAY better.  this dryer has a ton of heat and it still fits with all my other stuff that I (over) pack so it is my new travel BD.</li>
    <li> Works with both U.S. Voltage or Europe Voltage, bought for trip worked well and as expected, just need adapter plug. (The Voltage is selected on the  blow dryer. It does not require a voltage convertor). Don&#x27;t be shocked that the air flow is different, a little slower in Europe. US power operates at 60 Hz, Europe is 50Hz.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of this hair dryer, one for my daughter and one for me, specifically to take to on a trip to Europe because it has dual voltage.  It worked fine in the U.S. but when I switched it to the 240 voltage once I got to Europe, it would only work on low.  I have thick hair and it was useless in low so I used the hotel dryers and returned it when I got home.  If you just want it as a regular dryer, it&#x27;s fine but I was annoyed that when I was shopping, none of the information stated that it only works in low using 240 volts. I&#x27;m sure it was somewhere in the small print but that should be plainly stated.  It was a pain to have to carry it around Europe and not even be able to use it. I gave it a 2 because it works fine on 120 volts, even for thick hair, but I like the one I use at home better.</li>
    <li> Got item quickly but after 2 uses died, still got hot but did not blow. As usual Amazon was FANTASTIC about returning!</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer, not available, would have purchased the second!</li>
    <li> The construction feels cheap. And I really dislike no temperature option. Does shorten time it takes to dry my hair, and it did appear a little less frizzy.</li>
    <li> Works as expected so far. Is a bit heavy.</li>
    <li> Everything went well. I have used the dryer some tiems so far, but it appears to be everything that was advertised.</li>
    <li> I love my new hair dryer, it&#x27;s great.  I now prefer it to my old ones.  Thank you, Amazon!</li>
    <li> Impressed by the product, especially for the price!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my trip to Italy. I read the hairdryers provided by hotels weren&#x27;t powerful, I wasn&#x27;t taking any chances! This is the PERFECT travel hairdryer, it folds &amp; is lighter than my everyday hairdryer. When switching to 250V to use overseas, it only works at 1 power level but it was equal to the setting I use at home, so no sacrifice there! I only needed an outlet adapter for the plug!</li>
    <li> Love the idea that it is foldable.  I still need to get used to the settings because on one of my dryers the high and low are opposite.  It is pretty powerful for the size!</li>
