<li> It smells a little weird when you put it on, but it fades in just a few minutes, and it&#x27;s great not to have a face that looks like hamburger after I</li>
<li> Came sooner than expected overall</li>
<li> I have tried several other products claiming similar results with no success.</li>
<li> Overall, this transaction was a waste of time and money, and this seller should not be allowed to sell anything on Amazon.</li>
<li> THE PRODUCT WILL GET RID OF RAZOR BUMPS IN A COUPLE OF DAYS, BUT IT BURNS THE BUMPS AND YOUR LEFT WITH BLACK SPOTS AND DISCOLORATION ON YOUR SKIN!</li>
<li> A little goes a long way!</li>
<li> This is much less painful and stinging than the original formula.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m a black man that has been dealing with this issue for years.  </li>
<li> Product came a little banged up, but what can you do once it&#x27;s out of your hands.</li>
<li> I order two bottles of this, and not only did the order come in two weeks late, but the seller promised to send another order because it was late, and ever did.</li>
<li> I was introduced to it a few years ago.  </li>
<li> I usually put some baby powder on after using it.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t find it in my local stores anymore except for .5 oz.</li>
<li> The shipping though was really really slow.</li>
<li> But, again, it is MUCH less painful.</li>
<li> a little annoying how the contents separate.</li>
<li> Stinks</li>
<li> It&#x27;s really bad!!  </li>
<li> IT SMELLS LIKE CRAP WHEN YOU PUT IT ON, BUT AFTER TWO MINUTES, YOU KNOW ITS WORKING!</li>

    <li> a little annoying how the contents separate. you have to shake it every time you use it.</li>
    <li> Bump Patrol is an extraordinary product!  I was introduced to it a few years ago.  Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t find it in my local stores anymore except for .5 oz. size.  Thanks to the seller, I was able to get the size I am acclimated to without an expensive cost.  If you have sensitive skin, no fret, I don&#x27;t have any problems with it.  My break out prone skin has no issues because it is made for all skin types.</li>
    <li> The product works great. The shipping though was really really slow. but this product always saves my face. Love it</li>
    <li> Good product to use all over your body as a preventive and post-shave bump/redness reducer. A little goes a long way! No offensive odor and does not stain clothing, either. Dries quickly so you can get dressed &amp; get going!</li>
    <li> Very good stuff I recommended to my friend It&#x27;s really good nice I like it And my friends like to nice stuff</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the product I ordered.(ordered the sensitive) Got maximum strength instead which my husband said is less effective tan the original. It was during the holidays so I wasn&#x27;t going through the hassle of sending it back.</li>
    <li> Weird to say, but this stuff does a great job at keeping the bumps down! It smells a little weird when you put it on, but it fades in just a few minutes, and it&#x27;s great not to have a face that looks like hamburger after I shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the sensitive stuff, which stings just a little, compared to the original or the extra strength, which burn like splashing alcohol on an open wound. Which I guess is basically what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to be clear, go sensitive if it works for you...you don&#x27;t need the burn for it to be effective!</li>
    <li> This product produces drastic and noticeable results within two days. I highly recommend this product to anyone. I have tried several other products claiming similar results with no success.</li>
    <li> Stinks but it works. Best to use before bed.</li>
    <li> The best aftershave that I&#x27;ve used and does what it says it does.......My razor bumps are completely gone and my face never looked better</li>
