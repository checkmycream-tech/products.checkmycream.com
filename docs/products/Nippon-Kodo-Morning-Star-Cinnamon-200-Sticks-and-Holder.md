      <li>, it&#x27;s still nice -</li>

      <li>nice scent with out being too strong.  </li>
      <li>I usually love Morning Star incense</li>
      <li>Love the smell of it</li>
      <li>this is my favorite scent.</li>
      <li>I fell in love with this brand when I went to WDW Japan Epcot.  </li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>Lovely aroma, nice product, sticks are the smaller size--but not too little--so they fit perfectly in my incense holder.  </li>
      <li>We love the aroma and these are well made.  </li>
      <li>Great incense with a lingering scent absent of intense smokiness.</li>
      <li>Buy Shoyeido incense, it has MUCH MUCH more scent and therefore makes much more sense to spend your cents on their incense.</li>
      <li>Needs a lot more scent.  </li>
      <li>She didn&#x27;t seem pleased with it..</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are not overpowering, not smokey, and the cinnamon is probably my favorite scent.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love cinnamon and this scent is woodsy and spicy.</li>
      <li>I really love the Morning Star incense - not overpowering, just a nice, clean aroma.  </li>
      <li>Great for your own use or as a nice little gift.</li>
      <li>BUT the little holder is nice to have and they do smell very good.</li>
      <li>Burns very quickly and not too fragrant.</li>
      <li>If you like hints, and thats a strong word for it, of cinnamon.</li>
      <li>These things are pretty short, just a heads up, but they&#x27;re a great price for how many you get.</li>
      <li>This box has a large number of sticks--200 lasts me more than a year.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve been using Nippon Kodo incense for many years, mainly amber, musk and sandalwood.</li>
      <li>But this is nice for a short time.</li>
      <li>And it is nice to come home from work and open the door to this scent.</li>
      <li>just right ..</li>
      <li>when I got older we&#x27;d keep them by the alter, and then some by the catbox, so that whenever someone .. visited the catbox .. we could light one and stick it in the sand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought the cinnamon fragrance thinking it would be a nice occasional change, but I don&#x27;t care for it nearly as much.</li>
      <li>I have loved burning the Morning Star Green Tea incense, which is just the right amount of aroma without being overpowering.</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I love the scent--it smells just like fresh cinnamon bark--not that sweet stuff that most think cinnamon smells mixed with sugar and other stuff you bake with</li>
      <li>I love Cinnamon and when I found this scent, I got the smaller 50 stick box.</li>
      <li>I was given a box last Christmas and have bought two more since.  </li>
      <li>I expected a nice cinnamon smell from these incense.</li>
      <li>Thanks again for the prompt delivery!</li>
      <li>I get lots of kind words from people who walk into my little home about the scent.</li>
      <li>I would not recommend the incense holder they include, because it is too little and the ashes fall out, but the holder is a nice addition if you place it on a fire-proof surface.  </li>
      <li>(have been using for years and get more positive feedback than from any other incense I have used....)</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really smell like cinnamon, it smells like burnt wood or something.</li>
      <li>Thanks anyway</li>
      <li>I much preferred the Sandalwood and the Cedarwood.</li>
      <li>Other Morning Star incense have been more fragrant.  </li>
      <li>I consider it a bit misleading not to mention the size - therefore only 4 stars - the product is not bad.</li>
      <li>but this particular scent does nothing for me.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t particularly Cinnamon smelling to me -</li>
      <li>same as above.. love the smell of cinnamon</li>
      <li>I was so excited to try a new scent, I didn&#x27;t even notice the little holder at first.</li>
      <li>I bought a few different scents and they are all nice.</li>
      <li>The Cinnamon is probably my least favorite of the ones I tried.  </li>
      <li>I like that the scent is natural and not over powering.</li>
      <li>I find it very hard to find just the right incense; most smell strange to me.</li>
      <li>Scent isn&#x27;t as strong as I would like and the sticks are smaller than I thought they would be, which means less burn time.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Thanks again for the prompt delivery! We&#x27;ve been using Nippon Kodo incense for many years, mainly amber, musk and sandalwood. Thankfully, I saw that they offered it in cinnamon and tried a box of it. Three boxes later, we couldn&#x27;t be happier with its soothing aroma. It&#x27;s hard to describe, but if you like softer smells, this incense is a winner!</li>
    <li> I find it very hard to find just the right incense; most smell strange to me. This has an excellent aroma, I love it. It&#x27;s not overpowering, nor does it smell chemical or too perfume-ish. This box has a large number of sticks--200 lasts me more than a year. The sticks may seem small, but they don&#x27;t come on a wire--just place it in the small stand provided (inside a dish you provide to catch the ash), and its lovely.</li>
    <li> If you like hints, and thats a strong word for it, of cinnamon. I could not smell the cinnamon. Sad. It was perfume like unlike what I had read. Very fast shipping. Stick with what you have not worth it if you want cinnamon. Thanks anyway</li>
    <li> I expected a nice cinnamon smell from these incense. I usually love Morning Star incense but this particular scent does nothing for me. I&#x27;m a cinnamon nut. Love the smell of it but it doesn&#x27;t really smell like cinnamon, it smells like burnt wood or something. My cinnamon scent cravings are not satisfied with this, at all.&lt;br /&gt;If your expecting a nice cinnamon smell from these incense, save your money. It&#x27;s not there.</li>
    <li> A very good earthy scent. Try a stick of this and a stick of sandlewood...exquisite!</li>
    <li> A good quality product, and nice packaged.  Do not expect 200 incense sticks of the usual size. These sticks are thin and only about 4 1/2 inches long.  I consider it a bit misleading not to mention the size - therefore only 4 stars - the product is not bad. Makes a nice gift too, because it is really nice packaged and looks like a quality product. Ten dollars is a bit expensive when you consider half the length of regular sticks...</li>
    <li> These things are pretty short, just a heads up, but they&#x27;re a great price for how many you get.</li>
    <li> Smells so good!  I love it</li>
    <li> I love Cinnamon and when I found this scent, I got the smaller 50 stick box. I love the scent--it smells just like fresh cinnamon bark--not that sweet stuff that most think cinnamon smells mixed with sugar and other stuff you bake with--don&#x27;t even go there--this is just a perfect fresh bark--woodsy-cinnamon scent. I went through the 50 stick box in a hurry and just got the 200 stick box. I am ordering another one shortly. I quite often mix it with the Sandlewood or the Lavender or jasmine scent. I get lots of kind words from people who walk into my little home about the scent. And it is nice to come home from work and open the door to this scent.</li>
    <li> great cinnamon scent.  would buy again and it makes a great gift.&lt;br /&gt;I do like Morning Star incense and will look for other scents to complete a gift package.</li>
    <li> Scent isn&#x27;t as strong as I would like and the sticks are smaller than I thought they would be, which means less burn time. BUT the little holder is nice to have and they do smell very good.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I always have. I actually encountered it (don&#x27;t cringe!) at Disneyworld as a child, and at the time incense was &amp;#34;exotic&amp;#34; to me. Over time it just became a part of my household wherever I went -- when I got older we&#x27;d keep them by the alter, and then some by the catbox, so that whenever someone .. visited the catbox .. we could light one and stick it in the sand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are not overpowering, not smokey, and the cinnamon is probably my favorite scent.</li>
    <li> I have loved burning the Morning Star Green Tea incense, which is just the right amount of aroma without being overpowering.

I even had one client (who gets massages from me) comment that it wasn&#x27;t the usual scent. She didn&#x27;t seem pleased with it..</li>

    <li> [[ASIN:B0015DHGHG Nippon Kodo - Morning Star - Cinnamon 200 Sticks and Holder]]Bought this thinking it was a typical incense stick, it was not - it is very short and, for my particular liking of incense, it was not very aromatic, probably due to the short burn time.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite brand of incense and this scent is WONDERFUL! Would totally reorder when the time comes! A+</li>
    <li> Great incense with a lingering scent absent of intense smokiness. The cinnamon is a great fragrance to accompany the smell of fresh oranges in a room. Follow the directions to &amp;#34;air&amp;#34; the incense a few days before burning because the sticks should be thoroughly dry.</li>
    <li> Lovely aroma, nice product, sticks are the smaller size--but not too little--so they fit perfectly in my incense holder.  I would not recommend the incense holder they include, because it is too little and the ashes fall out, but the holder is a nice addition if you place it on a fire-proof surface.  Sticks and holder are both wrapped in a nice paper.  Great for your own use or as a nice little gift.</li>
    <li> same as above.. love the smell of cinnamon this is not overpowering..just right ..the smell makes you think of apple pie</li>
    <li> I really love the Morning Star incense - not overpowering, just a nice, clean aroma.  I bought a few different scents and they are all nice. The Cinnamon is probably my least favorite of the ones I tried.  It isn&#x27;t particularly Cinnamon smelling to me - in fact it has a bit of a &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; smell to it. Not offensive at all, it&#x27;s still nice - but it just didn&#x27;t ring of Cinnamon to me.  I much preferred the Sandalwood and the Cedarwood.</li>
    <li> 2 makes the room smell good</li>
    <li> Loved it great scent!</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this brand when I went to WDW Japan Epcot.  I love cinnamon and this scent is woodsy and spicy.</li>
    <li> We love the aroma and these are well made.  Some we&#x27;ve had in the past crumbled as we handled them.</li>
    <li> These are the best.  All scents.  They aren&#x27;t overpowering and work in a bath room wondering.  I have a bed of decorative rocks in a decorative bowl and that is where I stick them.  I was given a box last Christmas and have bought two more since.  I have had Green Tea, Lavender and now Cinnamon.</li>
    <li> The Nippon Kodo - Morning Star Cinnamon sticks is a good product to purchase, and the holder works well. They also lasts long.</li>
    <li> This incense smells great and burns smoothly. I&#x27;ve been using both the Cinnamon and Sandalwood scents for years.</li>
    <li> Burns very quickly and not too fragrant. Other Morning Star incense have been more fragrant.  It didn&#x27;t come across to me as just cinnamon but I can&#x27;t detect what else is there.  But this is nice for a short time.</li>
    <li> GREAT INCENSE! (have been using for years and get more positive feedback than from any other incense I have used....)</li>
