### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This works great!  </li>
      <li>Using this in conjunction with the wipes is the best thing I ever did for myself.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this product!  </li>
      <li>Amazing product with fantastic results!</li>
      <li>I rarely break out anymore and the scarring and redness on my face have greatly diminished.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
      <li>I have tried many drugstore and dermatologist prescribed lotions nothing compares.</li>
      <li>My fault for not checking more closely.</li>
      <li>Clear beautiful skin now that he puts this serum on every evening.</li>
      <li>So give it a chance, and hopefully, it helps you as much as it did me! :)</li>
      <li>This cream helped reduce my breakouts pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>For me, though, it&#x27;s going right in the trash.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone that is craving an acne free face.</li>
      <li>Face has been the clearest its ever been since I first began having acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t see a noticeable change overnight or in a day or 2 like some others, but after about a week of use, ~80% of my acne disappeared, and after 2 weeks, was virtually gone.</li>
      <li>Although I did receive this product for free, I believe that it is worth every red cent because it really does work!</li>
      <li>it works pretty good but no better than stuff you can buy at the drug store</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the high price tag.</li>
      <li>I ordered this because Amazon was out of the Spotless Face pads that I&#x27;ve used in the past with good results.</li>
      <li>burned my whole face.</li>
      <li>Started to use twice a day when bought and my face has really showed improvement.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t show as much</li>
      <li>Finally getting to have a clear and healthy face is all thanks to this product.</li>
      <li>Within just three days I have noticed that my face has less acne and appears to be in better condition then ever before.</li>
      <li>This product doesnt do all what it is say, is work as a normal product you find in the drug store.</li>
      <li>I no longer feel self-conscious about my skin and even go without makeup on the weekends without feeling ashamed or embarrassed because my skin is THAT clear!  </li>
      <li>I get an occasional hot spot, but it clears away in days instead of weeks.  </li>
      <li>It cleared my skin up in a month (though I saw a difference in a week), and I have had clear skin for 5 months or so.  </li>
      <li>I am 37 years old and still battling adult acne.  </li>
      <li>use it twice a day religiously (since first starting 6 months back); and the bottle lasts ~3 months (I don&#x27;t apply very large amounts though; just a tiny bit spread out over acne-prone areas).</li>
      <li>/&gt;You have probably already tried multiple products in the past, so why not give one more a try.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling gross like some other products and definitely helped to quickly reduce the glaring redness on my face.</li>
      <li>Like most others, I have used multiple other acne products over the years, with varying effectiveness, but never completely satisfied with any one product.</li>
      <li>, I apply some cream more specifically to that area, (in addition to the daily minute amount I apply) and it usually disappears within a few days.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product not only burned my skin, but it made it very dry and didn&#x27;t even clear any of my acne away in the process.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This cream helped reduce my breakouts pretty quickly. The product was smaller than I had expected for the price but it worked like other reviews suggested it would. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling gross like some other products and definitely helped to quickly reduce the glaring redness on my face. I&#x27;ve only been using if for about 5 days now but I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Although I did receive this product for free, I believe that it is worth every red cent because it really does work!</li>
    <li> I am never exactly sure if acne products will work for my face but I have come to find that this product actually works. Within just three days I have noticed that my face has less acne and appears to be in better condition then ever before. Finally getting to have a clear and healthy face is all thanks to this product. I would highly recommend this product to anyone that is craving an acne free face.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because Amazon was out of the Spotless Face pads that I&#x27;ve used in the past with good results. Since it was from the same company, I didn&#x27;t look closely at the ingredients--which was a mistake. The pads and facial wash use Salicylic Acid as the active ingredient, but this cream uses Benzoyl Peroxide. If you&#x27;re allergic/sensitive to BP (as I am) that means you&#x27;ll wake up with a rash and swollen face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it three stars because it probably works for those who aren&#x27;t allergic to BP.  For me, though, it&#x27;s going right in the trash. My fault for not checking more closely. :(&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this review helps anyone who used the other Spotless Face products and thinks this is the same stuff.</li>
    <li> Works wonders on my acne</li>
    <li> This is the only acne cream that has ever worked for me. I have tried many drugstore and dermatologist prescribed lotions nothing compares.</li>
    <li> Started to use twice a day when bought and my face has really showed improvement. It doesn&#x27;t show as much but it&#x27;s still there, but it&#x27;s slowly starting to fade away, and not many new ones form.</li>
    <li> Using this in conjunction with the wipes is the best thing I ever did for myself.  It cleared my skin up in a month (though I saw a difference in a week), and I have had clear skin for 5 months or so.  I used to have a carpet of small raised bumps on my forehead, they&#x27;re gone completely.  I get an occasional hot spot, but it clears away in days instead of weeks.  I also recently bought some for my niece (a teen) and she say&#x27;s she is benefiting from the product, but she has only just started to use it.</li>
    <li> It cause skin irritation and doesnt help with acne problem at all!!!!!</li>
    <li> maybe just me...... The irriation occurs and my face feel like burning.........</li>
    <li> burned my whole face.</li>
    <li> This product not only burned my skin, but it made it very dry and didn&#x27;t even clear any of my acne away in the process.</li>
    <li> it works pretty good but no better than stuff you can buy at the drug store</li>
    <li> Amazing product with fantastic results! Like most others, I have used multiple other acne products over the years, with varying effectiveness, but never completely satisfied with any one product. however, this one blows the competition out of the water. Simply Brilliant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(About me- I have had mild-moderate acne for last 7-8 years). At first, I didn&#x27;t see a noticeable change overnight or in a day or 2 like some others, but after about a week of use, ~80% of my acne disappeared, and after 2 weeks, was virtually gone. Face has been the clearest its ever been since I first began having acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a day religiously (since first starting 6 months back); and the bottle lasts ~3 months (I don&#x27;t apply very large amounts though; just a tiny bit spread out over acne-prone areas). And few times a month, when I have a a random spot/dot pop up somewhere on the face, I apply some cream more specifically to that area, (in addition to the daily minute amount I apply) and it usually disappears within a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have probably already tried multiple products in the past, so why not give one more a try. Definitely worth the high price tag. So give it a chance, and hopefully, it helps you as much as it did me! :)</li>
    <li> Honestly, it is not useful, maybe depend to individual situation.</li>
    <li> This works great!  My 13 y.o. Was starting to have an acne problem. Clear beautiful skin now that he puts this serum on every evening.</li>
    <li> This product doesnt do all what it is say, is work as a normal product you find in the drug store.</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday. I used to get that one painful pimple everyday around my lips and it&#x27;d leave a scar, but I have not gotten any since I&#x27;ve used this. I will only use this from now on!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!  I am 37 years old and still battling adult acne.  In fact, I didn&#x27;t even develop acne until my mid 20&#x27;s.  The Spotless Face Acne products have been a blessing.  I rarely break out anymore and the scarring and redness on my face have greatly diminished.  I no longer feel self-conscious about my skin and even go without makeup on the weekends without feeling ashamed or embarrassed because my skin is THAT clear!  The only criticism I have is that the products bleach my pillowcases and wash cloths.  Small price to pay for clear skin!</li>
