      <li>I liked this because of the cut and colors.  </li>
      <li>I actually super happy.</li>
      <li>But some hairs did stick up a bit on top and kind of in the bangs</li>
      <li>And it comes with a wig cap but was very cheap, keep in mind</li>
      <li>Love this wig, It needs some styling when you get it</li>
      <li>However i guess the wig is ok?</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good wig, then this one is definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>so you can modify it more yourself...</li>
      <li>This wig looks so much better than the picture provided.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It feels more like dog or horse hair..</li>
      <li>The most comfortable wig I own.</li>
      <li>many people at the con</li>
      <li>I was expecting a better wig for the price that I paid.</li>
      <li>There was this part on top of the head where you can see the wig cap and the hair is almost falling off.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this wig</li>
      <li>I suggest bobbypinning the sideburns and using makeup or something to fill them in more to make them look better.</li>
      <li>Everyone loved it and it was very well made!</li>
      <li>The wig is pretty good quality, though I did accidentally pull a piece of hair or two out of it, but that&#x27;s just cause I fiddle with my wigs when I wear them.</li>
      <li>It came here extremely early which made me a happy camper because it was supposed to be here by April at the latest.</li>
      <li>My 16 year old daughter was happy with it.</li>
      <li>I loved it so much.</li>
      <li>i went to asked if it was real because it looked that good</li>
      <li>Easy to put on, easy to adjust the blond hair to your liking.</li>
      <li>but it was easy to style and fix.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s super easy to style :)</li>
      <li>When it came about a month or so after I ordered it, I&#x27;m pretty dang pleased.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty pleased with the wig.</li>
      <li>So excited to start wearing it.</li>
      <li>I am very well pleased with this wig.  </li>
      <li>so that was cool</li>
      <li>, it gets very hot here.</li>
      <li>even more so since it live in japan.</li>
      <li>So, it is right for those who want to use it for Jean Kirstein at comic con.  </li>
      <li>Caps are cheap and can be made from an old nylon so who cares.  </li>
      <li>Clearly recognizable as Jean.</li>
      <li>The wig is really soft, comfortable to wear, even looks realistic, and looks just like Jean&#x27;s hair!</li>
      <li>It was pretty much ready out of the package.</li>
      <li>, the shipping was pretty fast.</li>
      <li>people certainly can&#x27;t keep their hands to themselves when I wear it..</li>
      <li>I spent 2 and half hours in 75 to 80 degree weather on a walk with my sister yesterday, and my head felt as cool as if it were my own hair!</li>
      <li>I got the wig really fast no complaints in that area</li>
      <li>Again as someone who doesn&#x27;t know how i would much prefer this coming already</li>
      <li>IT&#x27;S REALLY RAD</li>
      <li>Sadly I can&#x27;t really do much with it since I can&#x27;t return it after gelling it and now washing the gel out.</li>
      <li>own other wigs and this one is by far the best.&lt;br /&gt;Why?</li>
      <li>It actually kept me quite cool when the wind blew through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it could have a little more brown but other than that I love it</li>
      <li>Realistic.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this.  </li>
      <li>It was a really good quality wig and came super early in the mail (like a little less than a month).</li>
      <li>it was pre cut (unexpected but appriciated) and it looked ready for cosplay as soon as i got it.</li>
      <li>I received it right before my second day of Akon!</li>
      <li>I live in Texas so as you can imagine</li>
      <li>I was very surprised with the quality.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s soft!</li>
      <li>complaint is that the cap is a bit small and the bangs aren&#x27;t how I want, but I can easily fix it with minimal styling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price and shipping, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
      <li>but that can be fixed.</li>
      <li>Came uber early</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have much experience with short wigs, so I wasn&#x27;t sure how it&#x27;d look, since the hairstyle&#x27;s a bit weird, and because I didn&#x27;t know how it&lt;</li>
      <li>A little &amp;#34;fluffy,&amp;#34; but easy to wear with long hair and lots of fun to parade around in.</li>
      <li>That being said, it&#x27;s not super hot..</li>
      <li>I only say this because it was really fluffy at the top and the bangs were not super long..</li>

<li> I had to trim the bangs since it was a little bit long</li>

    <li> AWESOME! Came uber early and it&#x27;s super easy to style :)</li>
    <li> I used this for my Jonathan (from welcome to hell everyone should check it out) and my Jean (duh) cosplay it&#x27;s really great it could have a little more brown but other than that I love it (Agh sorry I&#x27;m funny af looking)</li>
    <li> It is as advertised and will work great for cosplay. My 16 year old daughter was happy with it. It is a little &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; (a few hairs stick up) but that did not bother her. Gives it a slight wild, I&#x27;ve been through a fight look to the costume. For the price it is a great costume deal.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;S SO COOL AND AWESOME AND PERFECT JDBBHCHJRBJ3VGCHY3YRF SO YEAH ITS LIKE SO TOTALLY RAD MAN LIKE IT&#x27;S REALLY RAD</li>
    <li> This wig was amazing! I received it right before my second day of Akon! Everyone loved it and it was very well made! Easy to put on, easy to adjust the blond hair to your liking. Very spectacular product!!</li>
    <li> I spent 2 and half hours in 75 to 80 degree weather on a walk with my sister yesterday, and my head felt as cool as if it were my own hair! I recommend this to anyone who cosplays as Jean!</li>
    <li> This wig looks so much better than the picture provided. I was very surprised with the quality. It looks just like Jean&#x27;s hair</li>
    <li> The wig arrived in good shape along with the wig cap. I had to trim the bangs since it was a little bit long but it wasn&#x27;t a problem ♪( ´▽｀)</li>
    <li> I got the wig really fast no complaints in that area even more so since it live in japan. However i guess the wig is ok? I mean as someone who doesn&#x27;t know how to style a wig the hair comes flat and the hair is very much in your eyes from start... i guess it&#x27;s done this way so you can modify it more yourself... Again as someone who doesn&#x27;t know how i would much prefer this coming already umm fluff... ed... er??</li>
    <li> it was pre cut (unexpected but appriciated) and it looked ready for cosplay as soon as i got it. no hassle to style it at all. many people at the con i went to asked if it was real because it looked that good</li>
    <li> This is an excellently made cosplay wig.  I am not a cosplay fan.  I liked this because of the cut and colors.  I am very well pleased with this wig.  I does have one flaw.  There is one weft that shows a bit at the back of the crown that showed, however I remedied this by wetting and redirectioning the fibers.  I like the spikiness and it is not scratchy.  The wig cap did not come with mine.  Caps are cheap and can be made from an old nylon so who cares.  The cut is not exactly as pictured. I checked out the character online and the photo isn&#x27;t like the character anyway.  The wig is.  It&#x27;s a very good resemblance.  So, it is right for those who want to use it for Jean Kirstein at comic con.  I highly recommend this.  What can I say, it&#x27;s great, buy it.</li>
    <li> This is the best fit for the character my daughter wanted to cosplay. It was pretty much ready out of the package. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I was weird with purchasing this. My only reason for being so is because of how short the wig is. I don&#x27;t have much experience with short wigs, so I wasn&#x27;t sure how it&#x27;d look, since the hairstyle&#x27;s a bit weird, and because I didn&#x27;t know how it&lt;br /&gt;d look on me. When it came about a month or so after I ordered it, I&#x27;m pretty dang pleased. Moreso than I thought I&#x27;d be. The wig is pretty good quality, though I did accidentally pull a piece of hair or two out of it, but that&#x27;s just cause I fiddle with my wigs when I wear them. I suggest bobbypinning the sideburns and using makeup or something to fill them in more to make them look better. Anyway! I&#x27;m pretty pleased with the wig. Good purchase, I don&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> The most comfortable wig I own. It blends in with my natural brown hair perfectly at the end, and looks good as well. Clearly recognizable as Jean. It&#x27;s lasted a while and keeps its fluff. Should my current one ever get damaged and I need a replacement, I&#x27;ll be buying from here again.</li>
    <li> It came here extremely early which made me a happy camper because it was supposed to be here by April at the latest. It  was soft and fluffy when I pulled it out of the package just as the comments had stated. Though a few hairs fell of when it came out but that&#x27;s typical for a wig. So excited to start wearing it.</li>
    <li> The wig I recieved is great quality, and looks perfect! If you&#x27;re looking for a good wig, then this one is definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> This wig is really different from all my other wigs, and the cap is a really odd. I can stick my fingers in between the cap layers which makes it complicated to put it on, and the hair is spiked up on the top *unable to really fix that* It doesn&#x27;t like gel at all. Sadly I can&#x27;t really do much with it since I can&#x27;t return it after gelling it and now washing the gel out. so.</li>
    <li> Great wig!!!!!! Spoilt r frizzy but no worries. I loved it so much. Got it on Christmas so that was cool</li>
    <li> I actually super happy. It was supposed to come on late June to early July, but came 10 days earlier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is that the cap is a bit small and the bangs aren&#x27;t how I want, but I can easily fix it with minimal styling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price and shipping, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think my wig came pre-styled.. I only say this because it was really fluffy at the top and the bangs were not super long..&lt;br /&gt;It feels more like dog or horse hair.. (oh, the irony..) I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s a bad thing.. people certainly can&#x27;t keep their hands to themselves when I wear it.. they just gotta touch and pet it.. XD and I&#x27;ve had multiple people think it&#x27;s my actual hair.. but because of the texture, it makes it a bit itchy.. That&#x27;s my only complaint..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a very thick wig.. That being said, it&#x27;s not super hot.. I live in Texas so as you can imagine, it gets very hot here. But the wig itself has very good ventilation. It actually kept me quite cool when the wind blew through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my only complaint is that it&#x27;s a bit itchy. Other than that, 10/10 would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> A M A Z I N G.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own other wigs and this one is by far the best.&lt;br /&gt;Why? Realistic. Looks like actual hair.&lt;br /&gt;There isn&#x27;t a shine that makes it look &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;The hair also feels so real.&lt;br /&gt;(Freaked out my family to believe I got a haircut, ahaha.)&lt;br /&gt;☆ A Must get. ☆&lt;br /&gt;If you are planning on Cosplaying this is the great deal. Good price and amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the shipping was pretty fast. So another plus! Thank you. ♡&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Few pictures to show. •&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Really liked it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this wig it&#x27;s amazing, it&#x27;s not shiny and it&#x27;s soft! I would say it&#x27;s a little poufy since it comes pre-styled but that can be fixed. AND it came in 4 DAYS!!!! That&#x27;s sooo amazing I cannot even begin to describe how happy I was!! Be warned that the inside has holes in it(I showed it in a picture) And it comes with a wig cap but was very cheap, keep in mind I didn&#x27;t by it for the wig cap lol, Over all I would totally recommend this wig to anyone!!</li>
    <li> A little &amp;#34;fluffy,&amp;#34; but easy to wear with long hair and lots of fun to parade around in.</li>
    <li> My wig was very poor. There was this part on top of the head where you can see the wig cap and the hair is almost falling off. It&#x27;s also very difficult to style. I was expecting a better wig for the price that I paid.</li>
    <li> Love this wig, It needs some styling when you get it but it&#x27;s not a problem at all. I walked downstairs with it on and my Nephew was freaking out because he has thought it was my actual hair!! xD</li>
    <li> Its so natural looking, my cousin and even a few friends thought I&#x27;d gotten my hair cut.  Awesome wig!</li>
