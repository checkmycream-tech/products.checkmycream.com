      <li>It took me about 7-10 weeks of not using this product, plus two further hair cuts, for my hair to return to being soft, silky, shiny, and beautiful.t off hair ends, leave on for 2 full minutes.</li>
      <li>This is a multifunctional product  and I appreciate it because here in SoCal we have such sporadic sunny days that can really cause your head and body to really really sweat because sometimes it&#x27;s 60-70 degrees in</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very good product, use it daily. I got an advice to use it as a facial cleanser and it works for me better than other way more expensive products.</li>
    <li> Revised review: Have discontinued using this product. Damage to hair shaft and ends was too significant. It worked on the scalp, but the damage it inflicted on the hair shaft and ends was incredibly bad and it kept getting worse with use.    I followed directions on the bottle, leaving the shampoo on my scalp for 2 minutes (less than their max. suggestion of 3 minutes). I tried to keep the shampoo off the hair shaft and ends, but even limited contact fried my hair terribly. There were multiple tiny unbreakable knots in the ends of my hair every day due to this product. I&#x27;ve NEVER experienced that before in my life.    I tried cutting off the damaged ends, but continued use of this shampoo damaged the ends again. I tried conditioning heavily, but couldn&#x27;t find a conditioner that could counter this extremely aggressive shampoo. I tried deep conditioning with olive oil on my hair as a pre-wash step, but that eventually failed to overcome the drying effects of this shampoo over time. I tried using the shampoo only every other day, and then once or twice a week, but the drying effect was still too much.    I have since totally abandoned this shampoo after about 8 weeks of use. It took me about 7-10 weeks of not using this product, plus two further hair cuts, for my hair to return to being soft, silky, shiny, and beautiful.t off hair ends, leave on for 2 full minutes. Rinse twice. Wash hair and scalp with baby wash to get rid of the excess olive oil which is REALLY hard to wash out. Condition with usual conditioner.) Seriously, it&#x27;s a whole lot of steps, but it is the only thing I can figure out that can counter the horrible dryness that this shampoo inflicts on my hair ends and hair shaft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product benefits my scalp and benefits the acne problem. It just fries my hair ends. I really don&#x27;t want to give up using it - so I guess I&#x27;ll keep on with the olive oil treatments, which are quite tedious.</li>
    <li> This helped when I had a lot of acne on my scalp.  Eventually I just went to the dermatologist and got on some antibiotics and spironalactone and it cleared up completely. I keep using this because I usually have to shampoo every day, but now I can skip a day.</li>
    <li> I would strongly recommend the shampoo for people who have tried other OTC and they did not work.  Good price!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son as an acne body wash but he wasn&#x27;t using it.  I tried it first on elbows and knees just to make sure it was mild enough not to strip natural oils.  I then used on arms and legs.  Gentle enough for every day and not too drying for a nice exfoliation without using a scrub or pouf.</li>
    <li> I use this only on my hair a couple times a week, helps make my hair softer and helps my scalp be less dry. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like this cleanser as I use a lot of products with glycolic acid. I use it as a body cleanser. Don&#x27;t be scared to use this. It&#x27;s very mild for those that are used to products containing glycolic acid. For those that are new to this, alternate it with your usual body cleanser to get used to it.     After using this regularly along with my glycolic lotion and vit E lotion, I&#x27;m left with smooth and more even toned skin. My only wish is that it had a higher percentage of glycolic acid. Even though it&#x27;s not made for the face I have used it on my face at the most two times a week as I didn&#x27;t want to irritate my skin. Overall, this is a great product for those that want clear and smooth skin.</li>
    <li> Disappointing lotion- I expected more from the brand and the price. It is not a bad lotion, but it did not satisfactorily get rid of my keratosis pilaris. I found that the 12% generic ammonium lactate lotion Amazon sells is the absolute best product for this at any price. It is also very affordable.</li>
    <li> This shampoo treats my occasionally dry and dandruffy scalp, and get&#x27;s rid of the problem completely (and I don&#x27;t even have to use it regularly...just every 6th shampoo or so).  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Dr recommended and I am going to be sure to use this shampoo once a week for my itchy scalp because it smells attractive.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this shampoo after reading so many positive reviews.  I think it might have done good things for my scalp but it kind of wrecked the texture of my hair.  It took a couple of weeks of treatments and a hair cut to get it mostly back to normal.  Also, the smell?  Not so great.  Quite overpowering actually and I&#x27;ve used shampoos packed with strong levels of tea tree oil and neem - both of which can be pretty stinky - and they were nothing compared to the chemical smell of this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Recommended by my dermatologist as the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; over-the-counter product to remove dead skin.  Fresh (non-perfumey) scent.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best Aqua Glycolic body cleansers I have found.  I think it leaves your skin feeling very clean and the scent is fresh</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product line.  It has worked very well for me (sensitive skin) for years.  I used to order it from my pharmacy but is less expensive from Amazon.  It is OTC but not carried in stores.</li>
    <li> I really liked the product cleared my skin. The price is a little high for the amount you get. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was breaking out using neutrogena face wash so I decided to look for Aqua Glycolic shampoo and body cleanser.  This product is non drying and clears up my skin.  I have been using this for about a month and love it!  I will continue using it!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended I use this for breakout on the back of my arms. When i use this coupled with  CerveSA, my skin improves 100%. I do find that the bottle does not last very long, so i order two bottles at a time.</li>
    <li> This works good but I docked off a star because it&#x27;s smell is a little chemically. I normally am not sensitive to smell but this struck me wrong. You can mix it with another soap to make it smell better though.</li>
    <li> This product is great for sensitive skin.  It stings just a little when you first start to use it, but it works great on your face. The price is right, shipping is fast.</li>
    <li> I have/had an issue with adult acne so i finally went to a dermatologist for help. She recommended this to use as face wash twice daily w/ a wash cloth. It has helped reduce the shine and after 3 months see wonderful results. Now i do use this with other topical meds my dermatologist has prescribed for me but with the combination of everything i can now say i feel comfortable in my skin.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Didn&#x27;t leak. Great product.</li>
    <li> Excellent for my oily bald head</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a year now every day. It has drastically help me smooth out my skin. This is not a cure but I can definitely go sleeveless now!  I Body Lotion</li>
    <li> My doctor stated me on this product. I never used it for my hair.  I finally tired it as a shampoo and my hair was so shiny. Helps keeps my skin smoother.  Take away the flakes.</li>
    <li> Works perfect for my skin. A very good price</li>
    <li> I love this product. I had an itchy scalp and this has taken care of that. My scalp feels so clean with this shampoo. It has such a pleasant clean fragrance which helps too. I use it on an old &amp;#34;shingles rash&amp;#34; that is itchy and it is helping with that too. I would give this 5 stars but the price is a little high, so I don&#x27;t use it as an overall body wash but I use it mostly as a shampoo. I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Not a huge fan. Didn&#x27;t make much difference for my skin issues.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended purchasing the product for acne on my back. But I decided to use it as a shampoo too because I was looking for a good shampoo that cares for my oily scalp that has bothered me for a long time. Once I used it, I can tell the difference between before and after my hair. I really feel my hair condition changed a lot. I feel my hair became fine and lighter. Also, I do not have oily scalp any more! I will definitely recommend people who have oily scalp should purchase it!</li>
    <li> If you have dry scaly skin at all or are just concerned with aging spots and wrinkles this product is a great addition to a regular peeling regime.     I wash my face with it almost everyday. Works fantastic.     Also I use it on my hair, great for getting build up off hair, great for scalp and as stated, it does leave your hair very soft.    I use this also as a body soap with a scrubby, and on my finger nail and toe nail brushes.    I&#x27;ve heard complaints about the scent, I am super scent allergic and or picky and the scent was no problem for me.  It&#x27;s clean and fresh.      Details from the Merz website about this product.    PH Balance 4.5  Glycolic compound 14%    Tip: A flaky scalp can benefit from using Aqua Glycolic® Shampoo &amp; Body Cleanser  two to three times a week, if left on for at least three minutes before rinsing.    Also Aqua Glycolic&#x27;s toner is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> Good product for maintaining my break-out prone facial skin.  I felt the face wash was too weak so I use the body wash all over.</li>
    <li> Bought this trying to help cure my extremely itchy scalp. I have bad dandruff at times and figured I&#x27;d give this a try after reading a lot of good reviews. Didn&#x27;t help with me.</li>
    <li> ABC news in 2000 tested many brands.&lt;br /&gt;Hands down Aqua Glycolic Products out performed Them all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes to show that $$$ usually does not work.&lt;br /&gt;Turned many patients onto this. One woman came in mild mellasm after 6 month it was gone.&lt;br /&gt;The best product to keep blemishes, acne and many more over time this stuff works.&lt;br /&gt;Most Vit C products are diluted and by law everyone makes it at 2 percent at best.&lt;br /&gt;All retinals are 2.5% because it is Federal law.&lt;br /&gt;To all the females using retinols in the AM the sun deactivats the retinols and the sun does so much more.&lt;br /&gt;The very best product for youth is SUNSCREEN&lt;br /&gt;SUNSCREEN SUNSCREEN&lt;br /&gt;If you think this wrong.  Mohscollege.org&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talk to me after viewing that page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To add 1 more thing there is a 13y/o with Clarks level 3 Melanoma presented in 2010&lt;br /&gt;How did this young woman get&lt;br /&gt;Melanoma?????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SUN too much exposure and no SUNSCREENCREEN&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now feel better</li>
    <li> Just be sure to wear sunscreen (which everyone should anyway) because it does have a hyper-sun effect.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I use the facial cleanser and toner. I was having some breakouts on other areas of the body. It seemed to really help.</li>
    <li> The body wash used in conjunction with the Aqua Glycolic body lotion, has irradicated my former issue of hyperpigmentaion (blotchy/uneven skin tone) on my back and arms. These two products combined have also greatly improved condition of keratosis pilaris (annoying bumps on backs of my arms), which no amount of scrubbing ever cured.</li>
    <li> Great product as always!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0000Y3DF0 Aqua Glycolic Shampoo &amp; Body Cleanser - 8 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been searching and using products for years for dry skin on my scalp, no other product works even half as well as this product. I highly recommend it.  It works so well, and does exactly what it is supposed to. I love it.</li>
    <li> I use to work in a dermatology office and I have seen many people use this product and it made a big difference for them in treatment. I personally think the smell is a fresh clean smell which I like.&lt;br /&gt;My kids have keratosis pilaris and when they use this regularly it works great for them. I encouraged people to use it for flaky scalp and they love it too.&lt;br /&gt;People with acne also had great results. Most people I knew that tried the product continued on this.&lt;br /&gt;Try it yourself!!</li>
    <li> This is a product I use all over from head to toe. It cleanses and gets rid of all debris. My skin and hair is much smoother and softer to the touch now. I love this product, its like being detoxed!!!http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NN5HFW/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_img</li>
    <li> I bought this initially to use as a shampoo, but am also using it as a body wash.  It has helped my dry, itchy scalp &amp; body skin.  I have ichthyosis &amp; have used AHAs or glycolic acid lotions for years to keep the scaling at bay, but had nothing for my scalp skin until I came across this product here on Amazon.  I recommend it highly, &amp; will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if this product does what it claims, however it did dry out my coarse curly hair. The should probably consider adding some humectants or oils to it to take the harshness away..</li>
    <li> This is a great wash for body and face.  My teen son uses it on his face too to keep his skin clear. Helps exfoliate dry skin on my legs and gives my skin a glow.  Really wish I could buy this by the gallon for cheaper.</li>
    <li> I go this for my son. I came in no time and  has really helped him out. I smell very nice and also is so nice that it is a shampoo and body wahs in one.</li>
    <li> I get breakouts on my shoulders, back and chest and have tried a lot of products to try and clear my skin up. Salicylic acid didn&#x27;t seem to be working well anymore. Sulfur based soap worked better, but also started to stop working. Within days of beginning to use this product my skin started clearing. I was amazed. I will definitely continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did also buy the whole product line for my face. I use a bit of the facial moisturizer on my body as well. It seems to really help heal the breakouts.</li>
    <li> I try new shampoos all the time - have used drugstore brands, Kiehl&#x27;s, Aubrey Organics, and many many more, but I always come back to Aqua Glycolic. Leaves my hair cleaner and looking better than anything else. I don&#x27;t use it as a body wash except when traveling - too expensive for that, and I&#x27;m perfectly happy with Dove soap.</li>
    <li> Really helps to remove scalp build up.</li>
    <li> If care about chemicals in your body products fyi this has parabens in it.  it doesn&#x27;t lather well so you lose alot of product.</li>
    <li> This is a multifunctional product  and I appreciate it because here in SoCal we have such sporadic sunny days that can really cause your head and body to really really sweat because sometimes it&#x27;s 60-70 degrees in early am then friggin 85-90 by afternoon and by the time you&#x27;re in the shower you&#x27;re tired. this baby does a good job cleaning my scalp and my body all in one go. Yes I use it on my scalp then fav conditioner then use this japanese exfoliating linen to thoroughly cleanse and renew my skin that has been through such strange weather. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Exfoliates really well.  Great on feet.</li>
    <li> It really gets hair clean, mild scent is not evident after rinshing hair.  It fulfills the promise of other Aqua Glycolic products, including hand and body lotion and facial cleanser, both of which I also use on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> As indicated in the title , I love the scent of this shampoo.  It&#x27;s hard to describe but it&#x27;s a really clean, refreshing smell.  In addition to that, it makes my hair feel so very clean.  I tend to get an oily, itchy scalp and this stuff makes my hair and scalp squeaky clean. No buildup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great shampoo.</li>
