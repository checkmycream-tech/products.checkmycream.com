    <li> can&#x27;t live without this stuff!!  my hair is so thankful!  never leaves my hair looking oily or greasy, helps to strengthen and smooth it, takes the brunt from my blow dryer and straightener. light-weight feel, but heavy-duty protection.  and it&#x27;s not bad for the earth -- wins all around!&lt;br /&gt;this product was shipped almost immediately and arrived within 2 days. very satisfied. :-)</li>
    <li> Great conditioner. My hair wasn&#x27;t doing so well after getting it highlighted. And I swear by these  surface products.</li>
    <li> Love the protein cream. Keeps my hair looking healthy.</li>
    <li> Best leave in conditioning product, ever. Try it and you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders on my ends. I was introduced to this product by my hair dresser and loving it!</li>
    <li> Lite and airy feeling on the hair along with the protection that you get from blow drying</li>
    <li> This is a great product keep hair healthy and ease damage. My hair is very fine and bleached, but Trinity Protein keeps my hair from getting frazzled without weighing it down. It has always been tough for me to find leave-in treatments that don&#x27;t cause my hair to be limp or greasy looking, but this one is perfect.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  If I go without it now,  I definitely see a difference.  I have long hair and it helps frizz, and helps with straightening it smoothly. I have thin curly long hair, so keeping it manageable in south Texas humidity is no small issue.</li>
    <li> I use this every time I wash my hair. Protein is really good for your hair. Keeps it shiney and strong. Great product.</li>
    <li> After being prego my daughter and harmones drain everything I had ,  my hair took the blunt of it . This product help smooth out all the frizz and breakage . My cousin who is a stylist recommended this to me .</li>
    <li> This is great. I live in a dry climate &amp; have thick, short hair. It conditions well without weighing my hair down or making it look oily.  It also allows me to &#x27;poof&#x27; the hair on top of my head with just my fingers and the dryer so it doesn&#x27;t look flat. CAUTION...spray it on over the tub or sink...it makes tile floors pretty slippery!</li>
    <li> Love it helps my hair great....wish it was a bigger bottle for the price though</li>
    <li> Great product for your hair.  It takes the tangles out of your hair after you wash it too and get to work with.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It&#x27;s not greasy and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine-textured and curly. On top of that, I have it dyed and I use a blowdryer and flatiron almost every day. Using this product before drying it has helped keep my hair in great shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only down side: I don&#x27;t really like the smell. But the benefit to the texture of my hair makes up for that!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product a year ago by my hair stylist and I absolutely love this protein spray!  My hair is very fine and tangles easy when wet, and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that actually works well as a leave-in conditioner and helps to brush my hair out without ripping it out and damaging it.  It smells great and the spray nozzle coats you hair well!</li>
    <li> For starters--I have straight, fine, slightly frizzy hair that manages to poof out no matter how often I use a deep conditioning treatment or products to repair it.  I used this for the first time today, and WOW!!!  It&#x27;s the best hair day I&#x27;ve had in a LONG time because it didn&#x27;t poof out!  I have shoulder length hair and sprayed 2 pumps of the protein cream into my hands.  I then rubbed them together, ran my fingers through my damp hair and brushed it like I normally do.  I had to do a quick brushing once it air dried, but otherwise it was completely manageable and I found myself running my fingers through my hair frequently because it was SO soft!  Just the right amount of shine too.  I got this in a subscription box, and I am very happy I gave it a try.</li>
    <li> i use this all the time on my dyed curly hair...I love it.</li>
    <li> Love this product line. I LOVE their Bassu hair oil as well!</li>
    <li> I absolutley love this product! It makes my hair very shiney, soft, and manageable. I really recommend this product to anyone to help the texture of their hair!</li>
    <li> This product is great.  I have thin and fine hair.  This product help my hair look and feel healthier.  Also, I am a hair twirler:) and it helped my hair become significantly stronger .so less hair breakage.&lt;br /&gt;The good news is if you use too much of this hair product is will make your hair heavy and feeling like it is filled with product.  So a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I use it while my hair is wet, massage it in right after towel drying, then use a wet brush to comb through my hair.  This works well because then my fine, thin hair isn&#x27;t weighted down. I then dry it and blow it out.  It&#x27;s just like a vitamin for your hair.  Love the results I have received.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I use it every time I wash and blow dry my hair! Works great to keep the frizz awa.</li>
    <li> This product works well but has soy protein in it ( I am allergic). If you aren&#x27;t allergic to soy then this is a great product.</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair that breaks easy, especially in the winter.  This product makes your hair stronger, softer, and gives it a great shine.  I use it daily.</li>
    <li> Again anything from Surface is the best</li>
    <li> You do not need a lot of product to get the smoothing results, smells great  great quick spray in conditioner</li>
    <li> not worth the price. it smells really good, but it leaves my hair feeling somewhat crusty or stiff. I was hoping for softer hair from it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 4 years now &amp; it&#x27;s perfect for my tangled wet hair. I can comb it out so much easier with the protein cream and then I use a styling product after that. Not too heavy. I have thin, easily tangled hair!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I like to use products together from the same line.  I have used Surface&#x27;s shampoo, conditioner, deep conditioner and styling products. I have the worst hair.  I am transitioning from relaxer to virgin hair.  My relaxed hair was really damaged from not conditioning, getting trims and and excessive blow drying and using the flat iron.  I can&#x27;t say that this repaired my hair or provided a miracle result but it is a very rich, luxurious product and now when I do heat style I spray some of it in my hair before blow drying or sitting under the hooded dryer.  This is a great company and they have developed top of the line products.  I suggest buying this if you like heat protectant and are looking for a more substantial product.  My stylist uses these products and that was my reason for the purchase.</li>
    <li> Such a great product and smells so good. My hair dresser gives me so much grief (in a good way) for how dry my hair is. I wash it too much. This stuff is my saving grace with her :-)</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I wish it were less expensive.</li>
    <li> I have used Surface Trinity Protein Cream on my hair for several years.  I find it really helps to keep my frizzy hair under better control than other products I have used (note that it is not a miracle product).  This cream also keeps your hair soft, not stiff like other control products.  If your hair needs a little help later in the day, just spray it with water and the product keeps working.  I find the cream too thick so I add water (1 part water to one part cream) and mix in a separate pump bottle (a small hand soap pump bottle).</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. No more tangles!</li>
    <li> Great product for helping with hair growth and hair strengthening!  Received within 2 business days!</li>
    <li> Love this product, have used for years!</li>
    <li> MY hair was dry ,frizzy,and pretty much dead it was even falling out this spray along with the shampoo &amp; cond brings your hair back to life love it !</li>
    <li> On my, admittedly find hair this stuff over powered it, and left my hair sticky.  Seller does not accept returns.  I think this should be bought at a store so you can take it back if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> My dry hair loves this. You only need a couple sprays.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Its great for color treated hair.  I won&#x27;t use anything else on my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renee Jones</li>
    <li> Love the product and the customer service has been excellent.</li>
    <li> again, you only need a few sptitz&#x27;s to achieve a great result. It is especially good in the dry winter months</li>
    <li> I have hair prone to greasiness rather quickly so I am always hesitant about &amp;#34;after-shower&amp;#34; products. This makes my hair feel amazing and it never transforms to a greasy mess as times goes on.</li>
    <li> I love this protein cream and I use it along with Surface Bassu Gold Hydrating Oil. I spray this on damp hair. (The mist is nice and fine, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about applying too much in one spot. You can also spray it on your palm, rub your hands together and smooth through your hair that way) I brush it through,blow dry, apply bassu gold oil, and straighten. With these 2 products my hair has never looked better. I use an organic, sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner brand and all of these things together make my hair look incredibly healthy, smooth and shiny. I&#x27;m forever grateful to Surface!</li>
    <li> An amazing product for maintaining shine and healthy texture!!!! Managing style and appearance is a breeze!!!!!!! So easy to order Amazon. Com..... No hassle shopping!!!!!</li>
    <li> great for dry, damaged hair.  very pleased with product.</li>
    <li> Protects my hair when I flat iron it and makes it so soft.  Love this stuff.  I have thick and color treated hair.  It is perfect!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
    <li> I have problems with the sprayer getting clogged.  I usually just pour a dab onto my palms and that works better than spraying.  Great for frizz.</li>
    <li> Amazing protein spray, best around for color treated long hair</li>
</ol>
