<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am surprised at how well it looks on me.  The key for me was to blend it with my real hair.  Very easy to maintain and easy to apply to hair.  I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love everything I order from this seller&lt;br /&gt;It is always quality and I can change my look as much as I want and the pieces look lovely&lt;br /&gt;I Hate cutting bangs Now I never have to I can have the look and then never have to worry about growing them back in&lt;br /&gt;I know it may sound phony but It is hard to find quality hair nowadays with New sellers cropping up all the time selling poor quality stuff but I have now found a company I can trust it is  MAYSU!!</li>
    <li> I really do love how this looks in my hair BUT its not the color I ordered&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a black and this is a dark brown - so its noticeable in my hair - I will have to dye it black&lt;br /&gt;and I don&#x27;t have time to do it &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> for the amount i paid for this- it was def worth it</li>
    <li> Looks unnatural from the top view... But overall it looks very pretty with a hair band</li>
    <li> honestly these bangs are awesome. I tricked alot of people.  I wanted to change up my look without cutting my long hair. the only thing is in the top you can kinda tell they&#x27;re not real, but not too much.</li>
    <li> i ordered july 12, it was shipped a few hours i ordered it and it arrived july 23. btw, it was free shipping (which i prefer.lol). I love the bangs it&#x27;s perfect it comes with instruction on how to use it and it has free extension clips included. it matches my hair and it&#x27;s like my real hair even if it&#x27;s a little bit darker with my hair color, it&#x27;s cool. all in all it&#x27;s awesome. two thumbs up for this seller. I will definitely buy on this seller again.</li>
    <li> In love with these bangs ! For a cheap price and very handy when I wanna pull off a different look (:</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve used clip on hair. I decided to give this a shot because I&#x27;m trying to grow my bangs out and I had a baby a year ago. My bangs at that length where its in the way but too short to tie back without looking like theres a hair fountain shooting out the top of my head. On top of that, I have a bunch of baby hair growing back after all the shedding I&#x27;ve done after my hormonal spurts due to the pregnancy, birth, and nursing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clip is OUTSTANDING. The one I got has two clips next to each other that have a great grip on your hair. You pop that clip open, slide it in and pop it back down. So simple!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first put it on, it needs some shaking and adjusting so it&#x27;s not so flat and \\&quot;staged\\&quot;. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for two days and it&#x27;s looking better than yesterday. It blends in very easily as long as your hair color matches the clip on. It feels very natural, silky, and soft. Not hard and rough like most cheap synthetic clip ons and wigs. It doesn&#x27;t itch and is very lightweight so its comfortable to wear for the entire work day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fringes on the side make it easy to blend in. I got it delivered to the office. I carpool with my mom. I pulled up to pick her up at the end of the day and she didn&#x27;t even look at me. When she turned to say something to me, she jumped in her seat and said OH MY GOD WHAT DID YOU DO! You cut your hair AGAIN?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAHA! I told her yea. I was so bored at work, I hacked off my bangs again. She had no idea it was a clip on. As we sat in traffic I popped it off and handed it to her. We laughed our butts off all the way home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my mom couldn&#x27;t tell (and she JUST saw me that same morning), this is a pretty good deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: As another reviewer said, if you have long bangs that don&#x27;t part to the side very well (like mine do), you might want to clip it back somehow in a way that doesn&#x27;t get in the way of the clips of the falsie. Or your natural bangs will fall forward and get in the way of the clip on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clip on is a little shiny when you first get it. So in very bright lighting, it can be noticeable.ward and get in the way of the clip on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clip on is a little shiny when you first get it. So in very bright lighting, it can be noticeable.</li>
    <li> for someone with a very small head.</li>
    <li> Soooooooo  bad !!!! It is not as good as what I expected! It is not as the picture feeling ! It is so strange when I wear it!</li>
    <li> I was a 100 percent satisfied with my purchase.  It just took longer than I had anticipated to arrive.  I got the biggest bang for my bucks with this hair piece. I recommend this hair piece to those with thinning hair in the front or people who choose not to cut their hair for bang.</li>
    <li> A little shiny but nothing a little powder couldn&#x27;t take care of..</li>
    <li> The bangs are very decent. They do run a little long, so be prepared to trim them a bit. They are completely straight, which if not careful while cutting can make them look allot choppier than you&#x27;d want. (The choppiness makes them look less convincing.) They blend fairly well with your hair, (or well at least with mine, I dye my hair completely black) no one even noticed the bangs were false, unless they were told otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I do not regret my purchase, and have worn these allot more than I expected to. My only complaint is the slightly bothersome original length.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected at all, quality was not good, color not like shown in advertisment</li>
    <li> Too shiny and straight. It does not look real.</li>
    <li> This item was exactly what I was looking for.  Good quality, well made, and a nice color match for me.  The shipping was incredibly fast, it was at my house 10 days after I placed the order, and the seller is very available and has already contacted me to see if I had any questions regarding care of the product.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Believable quality if you have jet black hair</li>
    <li> look very very fake will probably never wear I should of went to buy it at an actual store to look at it in person</li>
    <li> These bangs arrived today and I&#x27;ve been wearing them all day. I do admit they are really shiny( and on top of that really soft) but it won&#x27;t stop me from wearing them. My hair is dark brown and these are a bit darker but I don&#x27;t mind. I will be ordering another pair for my mother since she loved mine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m amazed that these took only 8 days to arrive since I placed my order, 5 days since they were shipped : from china ! The seller is very nice and contacted me via email saying that they checked the tracking and to expect my package too. They also told me to contact them if I had any problems or needed any help. Very thoughtful of them :)</li>
    <li> They arrived in a timely manner and they look great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the same item several times now, and I&#x27;m completely satisfied with the experiences. The products fits me very naturally and others always compliment my fringes; they even ask me where I got my haircuts.  The products also arrived earlier than scheduled.</li>
    <li> I like using the bangs, but you can tell it&#x27;s obviously fake when you wear it since it&#x27;s so shiny. I like playing around with it when I do different hairstyles and I will continue to use it, but I will not buy it again. The color is very black which is great because my hair is very black. The bangs don&#x27;t hang straight. They tend to sway a little to the side, more like side bangs. I tried to straighten the bangs with my flat iron&#x3D;BAD IDEA. The bangs are still fine, but I would not recommend you using your flat iron or any kind of heat on them. This is a fun and playful piece to add to your hair accessories and since it was cheap, I think this is an okay product, but I will NOT be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot, the seller is super helpful and considering. She actually emailed me regarding about the shipping process.&lt;br /&gt;I order the black one, looks natural on me since I have really opaque black hair. the fringe does not contain any brownish tone in it if you order it black, so take into consideration if you have dark brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;The fringe itself is really easy to use, looks natural and stays on really well.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I would say is probably the thickness of the fringe, it is quite voluminous I would say, however it gives you a really cute and natural dolly look bangs. But I really do like it a lot since it matches my style,</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like them at all. Not even close to real  hair. Wish they would have been like the picture. Sorry, Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Great experience over all, it arrived almost a week before the estimated date, and I even received a friendly email from merchant alerting me that it should arrive any day. The bangs themselves are soft, and blend really well. They are a bit long, but you can always trim and style them the way you find best suits you. Came with extra clips and a small pamphlet with details on how to style with the bangs and other products they sell.</li>
    <li> I was so impressed with this seller and the product. The hairpiece is cut nicely, realistic, and made with higher quality extensions. I received the hairpiece well before the expected shipping date and the seller contacted me to let me know when it was on its way. This clip is placed perfectly and sits well on the head. Highly impressed and if I need other items from this seller, I would most definitely buy from again. I even got bonus clips included in the package.</li>
    <li> I bought this piece because I hate cutting my real hair. It came on time and it&#x27;s really nice and soft, BUT ALOT of people asked me if it was a wig and some even said it looked like a wig! How embarrassing, obviously I said, no I made up an excuse as to why it was SO shiny and perfect like a wig. It&#x27;s way too long and I had to cut it. The bangs look shinier than the rest of my hair. It only looks good for taking pictures but to go out in public? Not so much. Maybe if you&#x27;re going to be in the dark but it was very noticeable and I&#x27;m very disappointed, the other reviews said people couldn&#x27;t notice but mostly everyone that saw my bangs did-_-</li>
    <li> I think they are great! Nice for a change with out the commitment! Everyone thought they were real! Super fast shipping as well!</li>
    <li> this is good for me my own hair dont want to act right i just use this and i love it</li>
    <li> if anyone is worried .....don&#x27;t be , these bangs made my life look like i am 20 years old again , all my friends and strangers say how cute i look , i look like a barbie doll...........</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find a good sitting position for this piece. Your face/forhead really have to be small to make this look right. My daugher liked it.</li>
    <li> I think it is good for the price. Unfortunately, some of the hair on one side was loose and came out almost immediately after I took it out of its bag. The rest of it has stayed over several uses. I can wear it for photographs from certain angles. In person, the visible under-lace or whatever it is called (visible because some hair came out on one side) makes it very obvious that, well, I have a hairpiece, so it is not usable for running around in. I took off one star for it not being very usable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other star is taken off because, even if the hair had not fallen out, it settles very high on the head if you want it out of your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the good points, it is cheap, and the hair spreads out easily and evenly across the forehead. On one side, the longer hair falls into a single clump instead of being more spread out because mine is defective. All of it should settle properly if all the sewn hair stays, though. Most of the stitching seems sturdy, so I am not sure of why some immediately fell off before I even used it on mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a decent hairpiece that I would recommend, but I had a defective one. I would recommend buying this. It is very shiny, being synthetic, but you can find several methods to reduce that if you look online. One way is to simply use it. Mine is already much closer to my natural hair after being used a few times (while sitting indoors at home. I would not wear this out because of the visible under-lace thing.) and washed once.</li>
    <li> I did not like this hair piece at all, it did do meet my expectations. I&#x27;m in the process of a refund right now!</li>
    <li> Very soft and realistic. The color is perfect.</li>
    <li> I got these simply because I wanted to know what I&#x27;d look like with bangs, and they are good for that purpose.  They are pretty fake looking but if you style them they look normal enough.  They look very real and cute in pictures.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for daily wear, but would recommend to anyone who wants to see what they&#x27;d look like with bangs!  They look totally adorable in pictures but in person it&#x27;s just too obvious that they&#x27;re not real.  Also very cheap, overall decent product, and arrived in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> It never stays in place, the bangs separate all over your face and cling to your jawline.</li>
    <li> exactly what i expected and for the price even better, arrived pretty quickly. Im really happy and recommend it looks just like my hair healthy and shiny</li>
    <li> Super cute and easy to put in!</li>
    <li> The bangs did take quite awhile to be delivered. Bangs were super soft and you couldn&#x27;t even tell it was synthetic hair. Came with extra clips just in case you broke or lost one. Hair is very thick as well. Only con about these bangs are blending it. Its really hard to hide the line the distinguishes the bangs from your actual hair. Maybe with a head band or scarf. Great price and is worth the wait. I didn&#x27;t suit me but still is a great product.</li>
    <li> It was thin and you can tell it is fake .</li>
    <li> I just got this today! The bangs looks so natural like my real hair but shinier:-) I was surprised it didn&#x27;t take that long to received thinking it is still coming from China:). Customer service is excellent! She kept me updated until the arrival of the package. Nobody can beat their price and their excellent personalized customer service :-) Maysu you are awesome:-) I will definitely buy again:-)</li>
    <li> Hair is soft and color is good, however I probably wouldn&#x27;t wear in public...looks like the bangs start at the back of my head..too costume like no one would think its real</li>
    <li> I really like it for fun, but I wouldn&#x27;t wear it to work because it doesn&#x27;t look 100% natural , love the price</li>
    <li> I thought this product was great if I actually looked good with blunt bangs...but sadly, I do not.  It matched my darkest-brown-almost-black hair and came with extra clips you could sew in to create a custom fit.  It was not worth sending back because shipping was more than what I paid for it!  It was a low risk for the price.  If you are on the fence, you can always resell on ebay if you find it doesn&#x27;t work for you.</li>
    <li> Love it! Looks so real</li>
    <li> Fast fast shipping. Love it. The material is good. It feels and looks like real hair. I bought the bangs for an event, so I haven&#x27;t worn it yet. Can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
    <li> Looks so real, worth my money</li>
    <li> So let me start off by saying I purchased this as part of a Halloween costume. (Agnes, from Despicable Me). I had my real hair sticking straight up. Everyone thought my real hair was fake and the bangs were real! Shocked a lot of people when I pulled the bangs off. However, the length was too long for how I had the rest of hair styled. (My pony tail was where the bang clips needed to be). I trimmed it myself - DO NOT DO THIS!! Synthetic hair does not cut well. It cut very unevenly. Trying to fix it only made it worse. But because it was simply for a costume, it still worked fine. If I had not cut it, and only wanted it for a new look I would have been very happy with it. A lot of reviews say it was too shiny. It&#x27;s true, it is shiny. I naturally have shiny hair, so it worked. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is because the side fringes are not even. One side looks much thicker than the other. If you wear your hair down, you can blend it evenly, but if you pull your hair up, it will look lopsided. Hope this helped!</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast being that it was coming from china. The quality of the hair was good, and the price was awesome. This piece on other website goes for $20.00 plus. The only disappointment was that I was sent the wrong color. I can&#x27;t send it back, because it would cost me more to send it back for the correct color, than i paid for it. It would be cheaper to order another with the correct color.</li>
    <li> I love it. So reallll! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Not easy to clip on and the bang is so small.</li>
    <li> Well  only a few minutes after I put the bangs on I showed my brother and he freaked thinking I cut my hair so it definitely looks real enough. Again when my mom and sister came home they also freaked out and my sister swore she nearly had a heart attack(I rarely  cut my hair) when she saw me so the first time was definitely not a fluke I do recommend this product for those who wants fringe bangs but do not want to commit to the style for long periods of time.</li>
    <li> Sorry.  It did appear natural but made my hair appear very flat on top.  If you have a product that would provide a heightened look that would be much more preferable.</li>
    <li> This was a  surprise gift, which totally brought tremendous joy to the receipent, suffering with hair loss.</li>
    <li> This bang-wig was actually awesome for a costume. most people thought I had actually cut my hair.</li>
    <li> I dnt want to cut my hair so I ordered this bang I must say very pleased with the texture no one knows it&#x27;s false I give four stars because the clips to hold bang in place could be a bit longer however hair pins do the trick for me thank you highly recommend</li>
    <li> These bangs look very cute when worn with a shorter haircut or with your hair drawn up into a ponytail. The little pieces on the side looked a little off when my hair was longer than chin-length but if I put it up, they looked better. Once I cut my hair a month after I received them (not because of the bangs, just by personal choice), they looked absolutely adorable with my shorter cut. They look a little too shiny on freshly-washed hair, but you can add some dry shampoo to tone down the shine. They work great to make your hair look good even on bad hair days!</li>
    <li> I love it.  Its cheap but it blends well with my hair.  Most cheap bangs look cheap and don&#x27;t blend very well.  This bang blended with my hair.  I dislike that it moves around a lot when i turn my head not as in fall off but it has body.  but moving isn&#x27;t good for someone who have thinner hair it causes the thinner spots to be visible.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this piece would be the dark brown down in the latter photos, but this piece is jet black. I wanted to see what I would look like with banks as a test run before I cut my hair, and this did the trick though! Plus for this price, how could you be mad? ;)</li>
    <li> This item arrived in a timely manner and is as advertised. Please watch my reviewon YouTube:    Watch \\&quot;Fringe bang hair piece review\\&quot; on YouTube  Fringe bang hair piece review:[...]  ☆Mï$$ Aųťůmņ☆</li>
    <li> these did not look natural in my hair and is probobly best used only when wearing a costume. Waste of my money</li>
    <li> It looks like doll hair once you get it so if you like doll hair you&#x27;ll love this clip in bang</li>
    <li> Initially I received the brown bang though I ordered black, so when I was contacted by the seller and offered the correct color at no extra charge to me I was pleased.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it doesn&#x27;t seem like it was just thrown together, the hair is a nice quality, it has flow to it, it doesn&#x27;t just sit stiff, the black color mathes my natural black hair very well, there are 2 clips on both top corners, it&#x27;s just snap on then snap off, the bang is nice and full, it cost about $6 w/ shipping and handling and the style does look like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like that the hair is too silky to match my hair texture, I didn&#x27;t initially notice the word silk used to describe the fibers, as a result the bang doesn&#x27;t look authentic against my hair texture (which flat ironed resembles a yaki weave texture), the hair came shiny, baby powder helped dull it out.&lt;br /&gt;Overall if the texture didn&#x27;t look so silky I would have gave 5 stars. No matter what I do it will look like fake hair sitting on my forehead.</li>
    <li> This shipped faster than expected arrived within a week! In the package they have the extensions, extra clip, and a pamphlet that teaches you how to properly clip in the extensions. If you do it correctly it looks really cute! Gives your hair a more voluminous look. I would definitely buy this type of extensions again! For the people who get confused about the color, look in the description before buying, it says black.</li>
    <li> I just tried on the clip in bangs, got great responses and compliments from people. All friends said it looked very natural and didn&#x27;t suspect it was fake! Definitely happy with this piece!</li>
    <li> Shipping time took forever and the color did not match to my dissapointment even though I sent her a picture of myself prior to her shipping it. She had great communication and was very cute with smiley faces. But in the end it&#x27;s been more than a couple of weeks and I havent recieved the replacement and when I do I&#x27;ll probably return it for the refund but I have to pay for shipping to china so I don&#x27;t even know if it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bangs also have a lot of mass in the front, so it really just looks front heavy. I can&#x27;t really explain it well.  Looks great in a hat because the hat flattens it out. Additionally if you don&#x27;t dye your hair normally, chances are your hair color won&#x27;t match unless you buy some sort of dye for this.</li>
    <li> For the price the quality is really great. The hair is very soft and seems realistic enough if blended well with those who have similar hair quality. It&#x27;s thick and it would seem to match most people with black hair...not too black but darker than the darkest brown. It also got here in 2 weeks way faster than the estimated delivery date. The only issue I have is although the clip is very strong (and it does come with extra clips) it does seem to stick out making it difficult to not make it look like it&#x27;s a clip in. As mentioned by another buyer it would look best with a headband or possibly hair with much volume.</li>
    <li> This product is super fun and a great new/cheap way to instantly change your look. They are very comfortable and a lot of fun!</li>
    <li> Recently I wrote a not so nice review for this item.  Since then, I have been in touch with Maysu and my problem was&lt;br /&gt;my fault.  Maysu is a wonderful person.  I have worn the false bang and love it.  Thank you Maysu for your kindness&lt;br /&gt;and good will. I will definitely recommend you to my friends. Sincerely, P.</li>
    <li> If you want a quick new style from your boring look or want to jazz a look up, this is the piece to get! Shipping time was great as well! Great value!</li>
    <li> picture showed color i wanted but for some reason i got the wrong color in the mail SMH.... whats up with that? will not be doing that again.</li>
    <li> I love it!!! I got mine in yesterday and I have been wearing eversince! It looks just like my natural hair color, but It does look a little fake, so what I did was spray it a bit  with dry shampoo and it make it look a bit more natural. I am very satisfyed and I probably will be ordering another one pretty  soon!</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t buy this you will be sorry. this product lookes and feels like garbage. Only in the picture it will look good. your friends will laugh at you because it&#x27;slike earing a halloween wig crap.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get these &amp; thought they would look great on me. I really liked the way they looked until my boyfriend pointed out that he could tell it was fake. Maysu, the seller, contacted me regarding my review &amp; sent me some very helpful photos about how to apply the bangs. She was very friendly, polite &amp; professional. After reviewing her photos, I see how the bangs would look good on someone who already has bangs cut, making them look thicker and fuller. I myself, do not currently have bangs, and thought this was a good way to have them sometimes. In the end, they are cute, and maybe someone who doesn&#x27;t know they are fake won&#x27;t be able to tell the difference. I will probably still wear them :)</li>
    <li> The picture shows a medium brown to a dark brown, but the one I got was black. Only one clip was attached when 3 of them are needed. The other two were simply put in the bag with it. It is straight and neat, but only buy if you have very very dark brown to black hair.</li>
    <li> Looks great and no one could tell it wasn&#x27;t real.  For the price I say absolutely get one for yourself!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking to elevate your look or to add a little spice to your hair, this bang is for you.  Really nice and full and adds a great look to just a boring ponytail or free-flowing hair.</li>
    <li> I kind of like it. I only wore it one, but it would be great for someone who wears bangs often of who likes to switch up their hair style all the time. It&#x27;s not really all that natural looking to me.</li>
    <li> this is the exact color as the image shows, it is made well, easy to use &amp; fun to wear. I&#x27;ll order from them again.</li>
    <li> For the price, I guess I shouldn&#x27;t be so complainey - but maybe if it had taken less than several weeks to arrive I would be more satisfied.  This took FOREVER to arrive and after all that anticipation, I took it out of the bag it comes in, gave it a shake, and promptly a big hunk of the hair fell off of the piece.  After that, I held it against my own rather dark hair (everyone calls it black) and it was considerably darker.  Not a big deal if I thought I could just ship it back and exchange but with a few WEEKS of wait time, I just don&#x27;t have the motivation any longer.  Finally, the artificial hair is SO SHINY you couldn&#x27;t POSSIBLY pass this off as real - even in low light.  I mean, this SHINES like shiny, shiny plastic.  Which I suppose it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap enough to maybe be half worth it to just put on and see if you think maybe you&#x27;d like to cut yourself some bangs (but I&#x27;m certain there are cheaper and more efficient ways to do that) - but unless you want to sit on that thought and wait to have the question answered for almost a month - just buy something else.  Or just go ahead and cut your hair because it will probably have plenty of time to grow back out by the time this baby ships to you from China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes:&lt;br /&gt;- looks EXTREMELY fake&lt;br /&gt;- takes FOREVER to ship&lt;br /&gt;- wrong color * (see note above)</li>
    <li> These bangs are fairly long, and if you don&#x27;t want to wear them far back on your head, you may need to trim them. I&#x27;d recommend looking for tutorials on cutting false bangs before trying that though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the length, these bangs are great!</li>
    <li> Worked well and arrived in a timely manner. A bit confused about the coloring so ended up reordering.</li>
    <li> Ordered BLACK, but received medium ash brown. Since it was cheap and from another country, I didn&#x27;t bother trying to return it.</li>
    <li> They are so cute! I was skeptical at first because of the price of the bangs, but all the reviews were positive so I thought what the heck, it&#x27;s $5. I put them on this morning before work and fooled everyone into thinking I had chopped off my hair! The bangs ARE super shiny, but I have read that you can use dry shampoo to damped the shine and I will try that when I get home. When I put my hair up into a ponytail today without thinking about how the bangs would look, it didn&#x27;t look very natural but I&#x27;m sure if I paid attention it would look nice. My hair is really thin so the part up at the top kind of shows, but only if you are taller than me or if I&#x27;m sitting. I think a head band would solve that problem though. The bangs were simple to put in and are comfortable to wear. They do feel weird on my forehead, but that is probably due to the fact I have not had bangs since I was about five and had a bob. One thing that I do not like about these is the fact that the longer bangs on the side, while they do help blend the bangs into my real hair, they kind of mushroom top me a little bit because they are not long enough to tuck behind my ears and they have a slight curled in style to them.</li>
    <li> The product came in early and I love them l, they are thick and just what I wanted! They fit in just right</li>
    <li> Very real-looking!!&lt;br /&gt;Fooled everyone!!&lt;br /&gt;This is a great option for hairstyle change, especially that I don&#x27;t like cutting my bangs too much, since my hair grows so slowly.&lt;br /&gt;A hairline off my hair color (black), but it looks so real, I don&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived sooo fast (in a week); considering this shipped from China, I can&#x27;t believe how fast the delivery was.&lt;br /&gt;The seller emailed me personally to tell me the product was on its way.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, and great experience buying this product!</li>
    <li> I chose the color brown and I received black hair color. Other than that it was fine, jut a bit disappointed it was not the color I hoped for.</li>
    <li> I have no hair due to chemo. I also have a lifelong habit of wearing head scarves like the little hippie I pretend not to be. Well, with no hair at all, my beloved bandanas seems more biker dude than cute chick. These fix that issue without my having to fiddle around with it too much or worry about creasing the back of a wig. I am not finding it as useful not that it&#x27;s co cold out, so I stored it away for the winter. Maybe when my hair comes back I can play around with it again!</li>
    <li> When i ordered this bang i didnt expect it would be nice but its actually really soft n natural hair no one will notice if its clip bang! Just super fine hhigh quality hair i will back to shop here for sure :)</li>
    <li> The Fashion False Bang Neat Fringe clip in is the best one I have tried.  I also tried  HairDo which wasn&#x27;t thick enough or wide enough in the bang area.  This one is a little lighter then my color but I have dyed one in the past and the color turned out great.  It is very natural looking it doesn&#x27;t look like its a hair piece and is easy to blend in with my hair.  The price is amazing for what you get and came from china  within 10 days, not bad.  Thanks for the great product. I wish this product was sold locally.</li>
    <li> The quality is wonderful! The package came early and I love the fact that it came with two extra clips. I will definitely be ordering from maysu, again!</li>
    <li> This was ordered FROM CHINA on Oct 4, 2012 and it was received on Oct 15. Considering that it was shipped from China and there mid-autumn festival and National Day was happening AND customs took about a 7 day holiday, it got to me here in TEXAS quick. The seller was IN CONSTANT contact with me letting me know the status and even when it was received at the USPS here in the US. Considering that all the seller was selling me was a hair piece for less than $10.00, they treated it as if it was $100.00 item I had bought from them. Needless to say the communication was GREAT and my wife Loved the product. She has yet to wear it but she tried it on without any problems and it looked good. Thanks for all your help and Excellent communication Maysu.</li>
    <li> This clip on bangs were soo awesome. The clip on is not thin. Easy to use. Some hair do fall but I think that&#x27;s normal. You have to be extra careful with these products you know</li>
    <li> I got my product very fast, and I like it very much because it look natural,it is black very black,and the material is very soft, like if it is made of natural black hair.</li>
    <li> Very soft and feels really silky. Good quality~&lt;br /&gt;They even provide a demonstration on how to use it. Very sweet.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Horrible product! No matter how I put this in my hair, the bangs appear crooked. They are poorly made.</li>
    <li> so face looking and to shinny with my real hair, sorry to say but that is my true feeling about it.</li>
    <li> The fringe hairpiece was made out of quality material - almost true to the look of real hair except for a slight shininess. It is easy to put on and adjust but I would recommend getting a trimmed by a hairstylist to make it more customized to your face shape and features. The fringe is pretty dense and blunt as it appears in the photos provided. It is kind of too dense and blunt for my taste even after getting it trimmed and thinned by my hairstylist but it is much better than taking a chance on my own hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product if you are needing some bang hair but although not for me i have many stylets who love it</li>
    <li> This product looks very real. Very silky and shiny and smooth. Great price, although not my right color. I would recommend it, even though its not for me.</li>
    <li> This was exactly as described.  The texture is nice and the color matched my hair perfectly. Thank you to Maysu for contacting me about the length of shipping. This is the perfect solution to not actually having to cut my hair to have bangs.</li>
    <li> looks very very fake thought it would be more natural but its not i wore it once and it just looked so fake dont waste your money</li>
    <li> Bought to fix my daughters dolls head. Worked better than I thought would</li>
    <li> It was supposed to be brown and it was jet black and didn&#x27;t match my hair...If it had been the right color all would have been fine...</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced, looks real, easy to put in, EVERYONE thinks it&#x27;s my own hair, the match is that good. Formerly hesitant to venture into the extension hair thing, this is so easy and looks great. Received many compliments a lot of people, a surprising number of people noticed. You can have bangs without the commitment of chopping off your own hair and living through the grueling growing out stage! PERFECT solution. If you want bangs but don&#x27;t want to cut, do these! Should have done it sooner. They&#x27;re fun, great confidence boosters. Wonderful little pick-me-up and easy way to update your look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if the color varies slightly from your own, they match up well enough because everyone has a variety of tones throughout their hair.</li>
    <li> I will not be using it.</li>
    <li> The shipping was faster than the estimated shipping and the bangs look great and are easy to use. The hair&#x27;s not as shiny as other cheap extensions and fit in with my hair very well. The hair color is black as described, not brown like in the picture.</li>
    <li> They aren&#x27;t too fake looking. If you have black hair, you&#x27;re set. The only problem is it&#x27;s a little noticeable, so I recommend wearing a hairband around it. It looks real whenever I wear it, but I just don&#x27;t like wearing it. I bought it for costume purposes anyway. It&#x27;s also a little uneven.</li>
    <li> This bang blended very well with my hair and you could not tell it was not my hair. I will reorder again.</li>
    <li> Great product , as shown in the picture</li>
    <li> did receive item, company did made sure I was satisfied with product even ordered a free one if didn&#x27;t like color</li>
    <li> I received this yesterday and I&#x27;m actually shocked at the quality. Not only is the \\&quot;hair\\&quot; used super soft and shiny, it&#x27;s really well crafted and amazing for the price.&lt;br /&gt;This particular piece has one clip centered to attach it, but it comes with two more spares that can easily be added if you&#x27;re having trouble with it being \\&quot;seated\\&quot; correctly on your head.&lt;br /&gt;It felt secure when it was attached and it blended really well with my hair. Had I fussed a little bit more with it, I am confident it would be unrecognizable as a clip in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it. If you&#x27;re thinking about it, go for it, the price can&#x27;t be beat and it&#x27;s an awesome way to switch up your look quickly without committing to bangs. I am definitely going to try more styles from this company, I am super pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I got this item fairly quickly, even though it didn&#x27;t have the 2 day Amazon Prime shipping. I bought this for my mom and she absolutely loves it! It blends really well with her hair color and it looks pretty natural. She&#x27;s happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I ordered brown bangs and got black ones....otherwise it is a nice product.</li>
</ol>
