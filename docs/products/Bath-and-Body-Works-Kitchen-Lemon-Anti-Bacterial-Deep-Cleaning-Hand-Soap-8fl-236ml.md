    <li> Nice fragrant smell of lemon for the kitchen. Soft cleansing for the hands.  Recommended choice of scent for the value.</li>

    <li> See my comment on the Sea Island Cotton product.&lt;br /&gt;Not only is it everything I&#x27;ve said, but it also is antibacterial! That is something else that is very important to me. You can never tell...tis better to be safe than sorry. LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> Love this soap and the smell is awesome! I will definitely purchase more! Great for kitchen or bathroom use and got within a week!</li>
    <li> I like this product because when cooking or handling meats, dicing onions, this product removes all the smells that should remain in your kitchen, not on your hands,</li>
    <li> I got this on time and have used it for some time. I like the scent and it does a very good job. It really helps cut the grease on your hands and rinses clean. Good kitchen product because it leaves no residue or after scent. Yes, I would recommed this product. The only thing about squirt bottles ,in general, when used in the kitchen,one should remember to clean the bottle after use.</li>
    <li> A friend had this in their kitchen, tried it there, ordered it, really like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I needed a non female scent for the kitchen, so lemon was perfect.  pump works fine, but I prefer not to have antibacterial soap.  Other than that, it was everything you expect from Bath and Body works</li>
    <li> Too bad we were forced to switch to a different scent.</li>
    <li> Every kitchen chore begins with a hand cleansing using the BBW liquid soap. It has a pleasant fresh scent, creates a nice foamy wash, is gentle and effective and leaves no residue. I have two soap dispensers on my kitchen counter - one for dish soap and one for Bath and Body Works Anti-Bacterial hand soap. I use a BBW pump bottle to keep the dish soap also, so I have a matching pair! A few years ago I received a gift of 2 shiny metal covers for the pump bottles, and they are attractive enough to keep on the kitchen counter all the time. I have tried most of the other \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; of BBW liquid soap, but the lemon scent is my favorite for the kitchen.</li>
