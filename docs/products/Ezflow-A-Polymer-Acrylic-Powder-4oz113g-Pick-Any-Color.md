    <li> Update:  I recently ordered the Vibrant Pink in hopes of having a slightly darker but still natural color for a different look, however, I received the regular pink instead.  It&#x27;s a great product, but not what I paid for.  I&#x27;m hoping to resolve the matter with the seller and get the project I ordered.  Will update when appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original:  I love this product, it is the only powder brand I will use.  Works amazing for everything from mixing with color powders and glitters to 3D art.  Doesn&#x27;t get clumpy and isn&#x27;t runny either.  Love it!</li>

    <li> This acrylic is a very good acrylic good for beginners. The only reason why I give this product a 3 is because when I opened my package there was acrylic powder every where, as I unwrapped the product I noticed that there was a crack in the jar.</li>
