<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I like this product for the reason that it actually fixes the dryness. The downfall of this product is that is way too sticky. I feel like I am lathering Crico on my fingers. I work in retail so its really aggravating having that feeling on my hands when I&#x27;m constantly touching clothes. I have to be careful on how much I put on before I touch anything else. Just a tinny dab on the tip of your finger will do the job.</li>
