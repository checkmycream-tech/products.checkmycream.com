      <li>Love it, love it, love it!  </li>
      <li>Makes a Huge difference in my skin!</li>
      <li>I have ordered it before and found it to be authentic.</li>
      <li>I question whether or not this was an authentic Gratiae product or a knock off.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product for anyone wanting better &amp; softer skin.&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
      <li>I use many of their products and love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
      <li>I love this cream.  </li>
      <li>I just love this line, I&#x27;m planning on getting this from now on.</li>
      <li>I really love this product.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it, it works great for my mid-40s skin.</li>
      <li>I started to see good results and had no breakouts, so I immediately ordered another one, thinking the first one must have just been a fluke.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love the Lifting moisture cream with Volcanic Stone, my face has never been so smooth.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, I would say that the product itself is an okay cream, good for moisturizing, but did not see any lifting or firming on my facial skin.  </li>
      <li>..medium in weight and easy to wear before bed.</li>
      <li>I have used their products for a year now and highly recommend their line to anyone who likes to pamper your skin and feel good about how you look.</li>
      <li>It really is a nice feeling to heat the stone up under some hot water, message your face, and feel the stress just melt away.  </li>
      <li>Anyway the  anti wrinkle cream arrived fine.  </li>
      <li>Arrived quickly!</li>
      <li>I love hot stone message and this is a mini stone for your face!</li>
      <li>but it is not and absorbs into your skin leaving your skin feeling smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>It seems diluted at best, and was a waste of money.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products but this one is by far the best.</li>
      <li>It much more reasonable than buying at the mall.</li>
      <li>So cool.</li>
      <li>This is a very nice, fluffy cream that moisturizes well and leaves skin satiny smooth.</li>
      <li>It is a nice moisturizer but nothing extra special.</li>
      <li>There are way too many products out there that you can purchase that come sealed and are in NEW condition.</li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>I should have opened it right away to check the condition of the product, but just set it aside for use when my first jar was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I got a good price from Amazon; however, the package was not sealed (appeared to have been previously opened).</li>
      <li>They make you feel good and maybe a little lift</li>
      <li>I would like to alert anyone interested in purchasing this item.  </li>
      <li>Shipment arrived more quickly than expected....</li>
      <li>This one has many areas of gold chipping off the outside of the glass container and very used and crumbled up tissue paper.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product that leaves your skin looking fabulous &amp; feeling soft &amp; velvety while diminishing lines &amp; wrinkles!</li>
      <li>and I have all of them from serum to eye cream, masks pretty much all of them</li>
      <li>Product was better than I expected.  </li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t had much of a change using this product.</li>
      <li>and this was real.</li>
      <li>so I could know if I am using it too much.</li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>THAT IS A REAL RIP OFF.</li>
      <li>but I have the real stuff</li>
      <li>I ordered one tub of this cream, but was very hesitant to use the product because it looked like it had been around the block about 15 times by the time it reached me.  </li>
      <li>I also really like the volcanic stone that came as a gift.</li>
      <li>and I really like it.  </li>
      <li>I have tried lots of other brands of skin care you find at high-end department stores and have not been pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>After two weeks I saw the difference, my skin is soft and some friends noticed that my skin looks radiance.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!!</li>
      <li>I am back to paying the full price for the Gratiae line because not only do I love them that much, but I refuse to be fooled and buy an imitation.</li>
      <li>When I spend this kind of money on a cream, I want to receive a product that at least looks new, because that is the way they represented it.  </li>
      <li>This product by no means came to me in NEW condition.  </li>
      <li>NEW.  </li>
      <li>I want a product to be new when I receive it as that is the way I ordered it and paid for it.  </li>
      <li>Makes skin feel so very soft.</li>
      <li>softer &amp; fine wrinkles are less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;Non</li>
      <li>I received the exact same product in the exact same leftover crappy condition.  </li>
      <li>Because I like how it makes my skin feeli, it&#x27;s  soft , smoth  </li>
      <li>My skin is so soft and supple.</li>
      <li>My skin feels soft and moisturized all day.  </li>
      <li>This cream makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t even know or begin to guess how much to charge for this product, but I purchased it at $42 back in March 2015.  </li>
      <li>We liked this product very much, but the last time we ordered it we were sent the wrong product and had to pay to return it.&lt;br /&gt;Never did received the above moisture cream.  </li>
      <li>I ordered the second one and received it March 18, but only went to open it today as my first jar is now gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well,</li>
      <li>The inside of the container was only about half full.  </li>
      <li>This is very different than the version you pay serious money for, and it also does not deliver like the version that costs a lot more.  </li>
      <li>Thanks but no thanks.</li>
      <li>The tissue paper looked as though it had been open and shown to customers again about 15 times, it was all crumbled and a complete disaster.  </li>
      <li>I love gratia product but since the seal was broken on this i feel like it has been tampered with.</li>
      <li>As Gratiae strongly advises that they are the only authorized seller of their products and that no other seller is the same, I now know they mean it.  </li>
      <li>no results, high hopes but another product that didn&#x27;t deliver ; at 56 years young, this product was just a waste of money</li>

<li> The Gratiae cream doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and give me blemishes, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin oilier, and it helps moisturize the dry spots.  </li>

<li> then googled this product and have realized that there are many different stories surrounding the product, real or fake?  </li>

    <li> Another wonderful product from Gratiae...the results are visual within a day or two...Judith</li>
    <li> I was trying different products but with Amazon we can find everything and cheaper. After two weeks I saw the difference, my skin is soft and some friends noticed that my skin looks radiance.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!!</li>
    <li> JUST BOUGHT IT TONIGHT THAT S WHY I GIVE IT 3 STARS...SOUNDS AND FEELS GREAT....WILL KEEP IN TOUCH WITH YOU</li>
    <li> I have had problems with my skin and moisture creams.  This product is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had much of a change using this product. I am a little disappointed with it. My service from Amazon was of course terrific as usual.  Probably will not buy this again, skin feels very dry in the morning.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> I had bought this cream before, but paid a fortune.  Bought it again with Amazon for a great price.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> Love this cream!  My skin was so mixed-up with blemishes and dry spots and wrinkles, all at the same time!  I tried half a dozen different products that either dried out my skin, created more blemishes because they were too heavy, or just didn&#x27;t do anything.  The Gratiae cream doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and give me blemishes, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin oilier, and it helps moisturize the dry spots.  Love it, love it, love it!  I highly recommend it, it works great for my mid-40s skin.</li>
    <li> This cream makes my skin feel so soft. I use many of their products and love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
    <li> I have bought this item several times....this is the 2nd one that i have opened - the seal is broken...there is even a disgusting hair in the lid with product smeared.  I don&#x27;t know what is happening - but the shipper or the product have become unusable.  I will not be purchasing this product any longer.  Thanks but no thanks.</li>
    <li> Because I like how it makes my skin feeli, it&#x27;s  soft , smoth  slickey shinned  and feels like I just had a facial</li>
    <li> I would like to alert anyone interested in purchasing this item.  I ordered one tub of this cream, but was very hesitant to use the product because it looked like it had been around the block about 15 times by the time it reached me.  The outside of the glass container had gold coloring chipped off of it and was all over the inside of the packing tissue paper.  The tissue paper looked as though it had been open and shown to customers again about 15 times, it was all crumbled and a complete disaster.  When I spend this kind of money on a cream, I want to receive a product that at least looks new, because that is the way they represented it.  NEW.  This product by no means came to me in NEW condition.  I was so desperate over the winter that I used the product anyway, knowing that it must have been a purchased and returned product.  The inside of the container was only about half full.  I tried to find an expiration date on both the outside box and the tub of cream, but there is not one to be found.  I had somewhat good results with the product, even though I was a bit creeped out using it.  I warmed my volcanic stone in a bowl of water in the microwave and massaged the cream in with the stone.  I started to see good results and had no breakouts, so I immediately ordered another one, thinking the first one must have just been a fluke.  I ordered the second one and received it March 18, but only went to open it today as my first jar is now gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, wouldn&#x27;t you know it!  I received the exact same product in the exact same leftover crappy condition.  I want a product to be new when I receive it as that is the way I ordered it and paid for it.  This one has many areas of gold chipping off the outside of the glass container and very used and crumbled up tissue paper.  Even if I wanted to, I could NEVER give this as a gift because it looks USED.  I went to return the product today and realized that I can&#x27;t return it because it&#x27;s past the 30 day mark.  I should have opened it right away to check the condition of the product, but just set it aside for use when my first jar was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then googled this product and have realized that there are many different stories surrounding the product, real or fake?  People in Vegas selling it at kiosks for hundreds of dollars and women buying into the scam.  Honestly, I would say that the product itself is an okay cream, good for moisturizing, but did not see any lifting or firming on my facial skin.  My thought is that Amazon is selling these leftover products from the kiosks in Vegas, probably opened and tested by the public.  The used tissue paper around the glass jar looks to have been opened and closed dozens of times.  I wouldn&#x27;t even know or begin to guess how much to charge for this product, but I purchased it at $42 back in March 2015.  I can&#x27;t say that the product is real or fake, there was no information as to an expiration date and beauty products, as we all know have or are supposed to have expiration dates.  My suggestion is to pass on by on this one.  There are way too many products out there that you can purchase that come sealed and are in NEW condition.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice, fluffy cream that moisturizes well and leaves skin satiny smooth. I have used this line of products two and a half years and I will continue using them.  Shipment arrived more quickly than expected....recommend seller.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Lifting moisture cream with Volcanic Stone, my face has never been so smooth.  I have recommended to all my friends.</li>
    <li> It is a nice moisturizer but nothing extra special. I got a good price from Amazon; however, the package was not sealed (appeared to have been previously opened).</li>
    <li> A little of this product goes on a long way. Makes skin feel so very soft. I really love this product.</li>
    <li> Is a product I always use.  Good price good service</li>
    <li> I have been using Gratiae skin products for 2 months now and I have all of them from serum to eye cream, masks pretty much all of them thank Got for amazon otherwise everywhere else is so expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I just bought also for my mom and see how it will effect her.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend all the Gratiae products because they actually works. Before I found this brand I used all the well known department store products.  They make you feel good and maybe a little lift but after a few usage it stops working but the Gratiae instead it keeps working and you see your face transformation.  It is unbelievable.  I look like I did a face lift.  Even my brother said that I look so much younger.  I look at least 10 year younger.  You know how you know just take your pic because camera does not lie.</li>
    <li> Start using this product about 2 months ago, I can already see the difference. Skin is softer &amp; fine wrinkles are less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;Non greasy, only need a few dabs on face &amp; neck. I would recommend this product for anyone wanting better &amp; softer skin.&lt;br /&gt;Buy this from Amazon.  It much more reasonable than buying at the mall.</li>
    <li> I am not as faithful with heating and using the stone as perhaps I should be!  But the moisture cream is good,.</li>
    <li> I like that it is non greasy. I like the feel of it under my makeup and I am very happy with it</li>
    <li> Product was delivered as expected</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a year and I really like it. However, this time when I ordered from Amazon it came from a different supplier. I question whether or not this was an authentic Gratiae product or a knock off. It just didn&#x27;t seem like the texture or consistency was the same as the creams I purchased previously. I appreciate that this product is cheaper from Amazon. I have ordered it before and found it to be authentic. However this time the product was inferior.</li>
    <li> I just love this line, I&#x27;m planning on getting this from now on. I also really like the volcanic stone that came as a gift.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for 2 weeks and I really like it.  I&#x27;m hoping it will erase some of the wrinkles I already have.</li>
    <li> This is the only product i will use on my face.  My skin feels soft and moisturized all day.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products but this one is by far the best.</li>
    <li> no results, high hopes but another product that didn&#x27;t deliver ; at 56 years young, this product was just a waste of money</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product that leaves your skin looking fabulous &amp; feeling soft &amp; velvety while diminishing lines &amp; wrinkles!</li>
    <li> Total rip off.  This stuff just sits on your skin.</li>
    <li> This product is great but the stone is worthless. It only takes a small amount. I use it with the facial lifting serum.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  Perfect consistency and smell.</li>
    <li> Great for the  moistering face .</li>
    <li> Outstanding product!  I have been using it for 3-4 years and what a difference it makes.  My skin is so soft and supple. I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> THIS IS A WONDERFUL BRAND, I THANK GOD I FOUND IT ON AMAZON FOR THE PRICE. Was worried it might be copycat but I have the real stuff and this was real. DO NOT BUY THIS IN VEGAS OR MALLS AND FANCY STORES THAT IS A REAL RIP OFF. But the product is wonderful.</li>
    <li> GRATiAE is a wonderful product line. I love using the products every day knowing it is organic and makes me feel great. I have used their products for a year now and highly recommend their line to anyone who likes to pamper your skin and feel good about how you look. I have to say the volcanic stone is a nice touch. I love hot stone message and this is a mini stone for your face! It really is a nice feeling to heat the stone up under some hot water, message your face, and feel the stress just melt away.  When you put the cream on, it feels like it will be greasy but it is not and absorbs into your skin leaving your skin feeling smooth and silky. I have tried lots of other brands of skin care you find at high-end department stores and have not been pleased with the results. GRATiAE is my go to from now on. I am very happy with the fact I found it here on Amazon! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> We liked this product very much, but the last time we ordered it we were sent the wrong product and had to pay to return it.&lt;br /&gt;Never did received the above moisture cream.  Very disappointed, don&#x27;t know if we should reorder.  However, this is a very good product. We have always been very happy ordering through Amazon, this was the first time we have ever had a problem. Keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> I have to say the product I purchased via amazon at a fraction of the price I paid at the actual vendor makes sense, it was not of the same quality.  I purchased the lifting moisturizing cream through amazon once or twice now, and I will never do it again.  I am back to paying the full price for the Gratiae line because not only do I love them that much, but I refuse to be fooled and buy an imitation. I will be calling amazon in the future to ask about the credibility of the seller of this cream. As Gratiae strongly advises that they are the only authorized seller of their products and that no other seller is the same, I now know they mean it.  This is very different than the version you pay serious money for, and it also does not deliver like the version that costs a lot more.  It seems diluted at best, and was a waste of money. I used at least four times the amount of the cream from amazon as I did the actual from the Gratise kiosk at my mall. Sorry amazon, it&#x27;s nothing on you- just the vendor it is from I guess.</li>
    <li> So cool. I think I look younger after using this for a couple weeks. I wish it came with directions so I could know if I am using it too much.</li>
    <li> This product was perfect!</li>
    <li> Makes a Huge difference in my skin! Excellent product..medium in weight and easy to wear before bed.</li>
    <li> Product was better than I expected.  Provides a moisturizing base for makeup as well as minimizes wrinkles and dark circles under the eyes.</li>
    <li> I love gratia product but since the seal was broken on this i feel like it has been tampered with. Would prefer the seal not to be broken.</li>
    <li> I purchased three items from Amazon...all by Gratiae.  They are to be used as a team I guess.  Anyway the  anti wrinkle cream arrived fine.  The thermal self heating mask was all greasy and had spilled all over the box and the lifting moisturizing cream was also damaged.  I sent the cream back  and got a refund.  The one that is all greasy inside I did not know where it came from as I threw the box away to soon.  Anyway I am now setting with two of the three jars of stuff and havent used any because one is a mess and the other has been sent back.  I know I am not very good on the computer but when I ordered them from Amazon, I thought that they would all be from the same person and I find out they all from a different place so don&#x27;t even know how to send back or to reorder as don&#x27;t want to have the same problems as before.  So will never order from Amazon again.  NOt a good expereience</li>
    <li> allergic reaction to ingredients!</li>
