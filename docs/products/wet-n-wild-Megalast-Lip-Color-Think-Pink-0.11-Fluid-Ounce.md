      <li>LOL!</li>
      <li>The pigmentation is the best part.</li>
      <li>Works great</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;ve heard, some of these can be great M.A.C dupes.</li>
      <li>Like Whoa! LOL  </li>

      <li>and I am happy with the both of them.  </li>
      <li>great product.</li>
      <li>This lipstick is AMAZING!</li>
      <li>I tried these matte lipsticks and I was pleasantly suprised.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just not the best for me because it doesn&#x27;t glide on flawlessly; however, this lipstick is highly pigmented.</li>
      <li>and I wasn&#x27;t expecting the color to be so bright.</li>
      <li>The seller is good about the shipping, but I did not like the lipstick at all.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good choice</li>
      <li>These are really good for the price.</li>
      <li>I really, really love these!</li>
      <li>it is a nice affordable matte lipsticks.</li>
      <li>I do think it would look nice on a fairer skintone with a lighter hair color.</li>
      <li>Pretty color, but was kind of like play makeup!!</li>
      <li>The lipstick doesn&#x27;t go on very smoothly</li>
      <li>I prefer more nude colors</li>
      <li>4 stars :) would recommend.</li>
      <li>will buy from this shop again! :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>It was better</li>
      <li>I think a lighter complexion would suit this color better.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t retract,but it will the more you use it.</li>
      <li>Overall moisturize lips before use and apply to get best results.</li>
      <li>The feeling is very comfortable and glides on easily.</li>
      <li>I kept trying to steal it until I finally bought my own lol.</li>
      <li>A normal lipstick is more matte than that thing, and its just good lipstick.</li>
      <li>Good Price, Fast Shipping.</li>
      <li>It shows your flaws,such as,cracked chapped lips and fine lines if you have any.</li>
      <li>but some like the matte look so it would be fine for you if you do.</li>
      <li>Color is much to light for me</li>
      <li>and it was cheap.</li>
      <li>if your light skin you might not like this .</li>
      <li>First of all i was a really excited because its a pretty trendy color and said it had a matte finish.</li>
      <li>This cheap $2.49 lip stick from Wallgreens is Fun.</li>
      <li>The color is true to the tube.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for something to make your lips look full, this is it.</li>
      <li>gave it five stars because, it came early and was packaged nicely.</li>
      <li>Since this is beautiful natural pink in a neutral color and the original lip is shown more finely, I like this lipstick very!</li>
      <li>Would be great if you were going for a VERY pink lip.  </li>
      <li>Cute color, lasts for quite some time and decent quality.</li>
      <li>it got here i was happy because i had a pink nude lipstick, which was matte, and when i tried it on mu words were exactly WHAT</li>
      <li>It Really WORKS!!   </li>
      <li>I will give it praise for its very pigmented color, even though I&#x27;m not a fan of the bright pink it is.</li>
      <li>These Wet n&#x27; Wild lipsticks are a great buy.</li>
      <li>Okay the color on the packaging is a light pink</li>
      <li>I went to the drugstore not long after receiving, and purchased three more colors.</li>
      <li>I definitely plan to buy more of these.</li>
      <li>Pretty color</li>
      <li>but its still pretty i guess.</li>
      <li>potentially someone else would love it</li>
      <li>and it was so pretty</li>
      <li>Great for the money, but the consistency is too thick and chalky by itself.</li>
      <li>Very Neon Pink,i LIKE it!</li>
      <li>Second of all it is very drying on your lips and makes lines and cracks in lips more noticeable.</li>
      <li>like how it&#x27;s easy to put on, and the pink isn&#x27;t bold so that I don&#x27;t stand</li>
      <li>Well i thought it wouldve been more like a nude pink</li>
      <li>I really like this whole line.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very. . .</li>
      <li>I sort of like the color, it came much brighter</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really chalky</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if other colors from this collection wear better than this one on me, and I&#x27;m not going to risk it.</li>
      <li>Even more than a lot of other high end brands.</li>
      <li>pictured more of a dark beige color when purchasing it.</li>
      <li>last along time and feels light on the lips,doesn&#x27;t crack that much unless your lips are already gross.</li>
      <li>I am a pretty big cosmetics guru but never got into lipstick too much...</li>
      <li>pink, whereas the color advertised is a bit more soft/nudish than it actually is.</li>
      <li>the actual color is a bright icy pink.</li>
      <li>Only problem is the packaging, but its so cheap that its expected.</li>
      <li>I think it makes me look like a drag queen, which isn&#x27;t exactly the look</li>
      <li>Vibrant color, long staying power.</li>
      <li>Bare It</li>
      <li>to pink dont really like it</li>
      <li>apparently it isnt.</li>
      <li>I will probably use it because i paid for this thing, but I definitely wont buy a wet&#x27;n wild product again!</li>

<li> not have long lasting coverage.&lt;br</li>
<li> It is very matte and hard to remove..</li>
<li> I wear lip balm underneath for moisturization and it glides on and stays on for a long time.</li>
<li> It also doesn&#x27;t stay on as long.</li>
<li> I purchased red velvent and think pink</li>
<li> It makes a nice long lasting base though.</li>
<li> Too dry and matte</li>
<li> dislike how dry it is, but with some lip balm</li>
<li> Its not a good color, its actually really rachted, its shiny as hell.</li>
<li> It goes on very pink and it&#x27;s a cross between 80s pink lipstick and</li>
<li> Not the PINK i was hoping for but glides on well, just no my color but</li>
<li> This is a neutral pink you can wear anywhere with anything.</li>
<li> I mix it with other lip gloss .</li>
<li> but I layer it with other colors</li>
<li> Also another thing I recommend with these lipsticks is do not glide the lipstick on like you would with any other lipstick, but dab it on your lips until you reach the intensity of the color that you want.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have chapped lips or lines but in the winter they do get a little dry.  </li>
<li> it very pink for my lips .</li>
<li> They look a lot less cakey than other lipsticks I have attempted, and at the price you really cannot go wrong.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Vibrant color, long staying power.</li>
    <li> Pictures if colors can be deceiving</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the current 90s makeup craze. I was thinking I&#x27;d try out a frosted type of look. I will say that the lipstick definitely gives a frosted look, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium brown skin with neutral undertones. I think it makes me look like a drag queen, which isn&#x27;t exactly the look I was going for. The lipstick doesn&#x27;t go on very smoothly either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I do think it would look nice on a fairer skintone with a lighter hair color.</li>
    <li> This is matte,but still creamy,it&#x27;s a cross of both.It&#x27;s not that drying.It would be if you have Lizard Lips already.The color is true to the tube.It doesn&#x27;t retract,but it will the more you use it.It&lt;br /&gt;does last along time and feels light on the lips,doesn&#x27;t crack that much unless your lips are already gross.It was better then I thought it would be</li>
    <li> Pretty color, but was kind of like play makeup!!</li>
    <li> Bought this based on a pinterest beauty hack.  Was supposed to mimic Mac&#x27;s nude lipstick, but disappointingly it does not.  It goes on very pink and it&#x27;s a cross between 80s pink lipstick and possibly kids play makeup.  Would be great if you were going for a VERY pink lip.  Didn&#x27;t like that it stained my lips a bit after I tried taking it off.  Color is comparable to cake frosting.</li>
    <li> Well i thought it wouldve been more like a nude pink apparently it isnt. but its still pretty i guess.</li>
    <li> Good Price, Fast Shipping.</li>
    <li> I really like this whole line. The colors are really nice, just the consistency isn&#x27;t the best. I recommend moisturizing your lips with something like a thick chapstick or maybe even vaseline before using these. Also another thing I recommend with these lipsticks is do not glide the lipstick on like you would with any other lipstick, but dab it on your lips until you reach the intensity of the color that you want. This helps it look a lot less chalky. These are really good for the price.</li>
    <li> Different color than picture and difficult to apply. Chalky.</li>
    <li> This is a neutral pink you can wear anywhere with anything. Shipping was fast. Only problem is the packaging, but its so cheap that its expected. 4 stars :) would recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on a recommendation. This lipstick is AMAZING! Truly. I went to the drugstore not long after receiving, and purchased three more colors. These Wet n&#x27; Wild lipsticks are a great buy. Obviously for this price you will have to reapply every so often. The pigmentation is the best part. The feeling is very comfortable and glides on easily. I really, really love these! Even more than a lot of other high end brands. And I&#x27;ve heard, some of these can be great M.A.C dupes.</li>
    <li> As others have previously stated, the lipstick is chalky. Like, a lot. The color isn&#x27;t up for my taste either. It&#x27;s very. . . pink, whereas the color advertised is a bit more soft/nudish than it actually is. I have a medium skin tone (it&#x27;s more beigey than anything; not pink and not olive, somewhere in between), and it looks just horrible. I don&#x27;t know if other colors from this collection wear better than this one on me, and I&#x27;m not going to risk it. I think a lighter complexion would suit this color better. The seller is good about the shipping, but I did not like the lipstick at all. I&#x27;m probably going to just throw it away.</li>
    <li> First of all i was a really excited because its a pretty trendy color and said it had a matte finish. It took 2 weeks to get to the place i sent my stuff so they can ship it to my house. Which made me pay a shipping 2 the price of the product.&lt;br /&gt;When it got here i was happy because i had a pink nude lipstick, which was matte, and when i tried it on mu words were exactly WHAT THE HELL DID I JUST BUY. Its not a good color, its actually really rachted, its shiny as hell. A normal lipstick is more matte than that thing, and its just good lipstick. I will probably use it because i paid for this thing, but I definitely wont buy a wet&#x27;n wild product again!</li>
    <li> 5 STARS:&lt;br /&gt;I gave it five stars because, it came early and was packaged nicely. (Came with Wet N Wild Lipstick Bare It All #902C)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liked:&lt;br /&gt;I like how it&#x27;s easy to put on, and the pink isn&#x27;t bold so that I don&#x27;t stand out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislike:&lt;br /&gt;I dislike how dry it is, but with some lip balm it&#x27;s perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend:&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to my sister and mom!&lt;br /&gt;I will buy from this shop again! :)</li>
    <li> Cute color, lasts for quite some time and decent quality. I think that for the price, you just can&#x27;t beat it! :-D</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s just not the best for me because it doesn&#x27;t glide on flawlessly; however, this lipstick is highly pigmented.</li>
    <li> Like Whoa! LOL  This cheap $2.49 lip stick from Wallgreens is Fun. I don&#x27;t have chapped lips or lines but in the winter they do get a little dry.  It shows your flaws,such as,cracked chapped lips and fine lines if you have any. It does stay on even after a KISS but when i drink water it does remove it somewhat.  I wear lip balm underneath for moisturization and it glides on and stays on for a long time. It is very matte and hard to remove.. It Really WORKS!!   Very Neon Pink,i LIKE it! Glowing neon Lips. LOL!</li>
    <li> Works great I like the color</li>
    <li> Since this is beautiful natural pink in a neutral color and the original lip is shown more finely, I like this lipstick very!</li>
    <li> it very pink for my lips . I mix it with other lip gloss . if your light skin you might not like this . it is a nice affordable matte lipsticks.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for something to make your lips look full, this is it. My friend let me use hers once and it was so pretty I kept trying to steal it until I finally bought my own lol. It&#x27;s a good choice and I dont even wear lipstick on the regular</li>
    <li> Okay the color on the packaging is a light pink the actual color is a bright icy pink. Packaging is inexpensive but it only costs 0.97. Second of all it is very drying on your lips and makes lines and cracks in lips more noticeable. Overall moisturize lips before use and apply to get best results.</li>
    <li> great product. would totally recommend~~~~ same quality as mac lipstick!... dont waste money on mac this is the best... t</li>
    <li> to pink dont really like it</li>
    <li> Great for the money, but the consistency is too thick and chalky by itself. I&#x27;d reccomends layering it with a smoother lipstick so it doesn&#x27;t crack and look ridiculous.</li>
    <li> Not the PINK i was hoping for but glides on well, just no my color but potentially someone else would love it I prefer more nude colors</li>
    <li> Pretty color and it was cheap.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really chalky and I wasn&#x27;t expecting the color to be so bright. You can see every crack in your lips if you do not moisturize your lips beforehand. I was hoping this would moisturize as well as color but I was disappointed. I will give it praise for its very pigmented color, even though I&#x27;m not a fan of the bright pink it is.</li>
    <li> If you have chapped lips even a little this will look all flaky. It also doesn&#x27;t stay on as long.</li>
    <li> I am a pretty big cosmetics guru but never got into lipstick too much...I always thought it felt to heavy and fake and tasted bad and looked unnatural.  I tried these matte lipsticks and I was pleasantly suprised.  I purchased red velvent and think pink and I am happy with the both of them.  They look a lot less cakey than other lipsticks I have attempted, and at the price you really cannot go wrong. I definitely plan to buy more of these.</li>
    <li> I sort of like the color, it came much brighter then I thought it would be.&lt;br /&gt;I pictured more of a dark beige color when purchasing it. Still like it though.&lt;br /&gt;Does not have long lasting coverage.&lt;br /&gt;Caseing is cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> Color is much to light for me but I layer it with other colors and I can make it work. Too dry and matte but some like the matte look so it would be fine for you if you do. I add lipgloss and it works for me. It makes a nice long lasting base though.</li>
