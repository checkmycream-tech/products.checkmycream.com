      <li>I love this product so much!!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use, thanks to the great little heat protectant glove for your hand, and it curls your hair perfectly.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quick and you don&#x27;t have to do many curls, just the top layer of your hair.  </li>

      <li>If you are searching for the perfect curling iron then search no more because this is the one and the price is right</li>
      <li>I have the flat irons and loved them</li>
      <li>I have 2 burns from not wearing the glove :) the only thing is I wish I had more attachments.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to buy this curling iron because I love how the clipless barrels give your hair a natural wave.</li>
      <li>The iron itself heats up quite fast and is comfortable to hold in hand.</li>
      <li>they  like it  ,and most of them  ask me to bring HSI PROFESSIONAL  for them</li>
      <li>For what you get in this box, the price is so worth it.</li>
      <li>I had found I liked the larger barrel size as I have medium-long hair.</li>

      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not even like this is &amp;#34;SO MUCH MONEY&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Very dissapointed bc</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this iron to all of you have tried a million others and given up like I had!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this company and its products!</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re all made in China and rip offs from each other.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, due to many of these reviews, I anticipated receiving the mult-barrel version.</li>
      <li>The glove that&#x27;s included is not only handy but necessary as I am new to wand curling my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many others in an attempt to get that slightly wavy, curly \\&quot;beach hair\\&quot; look that looks so natural on everyone else, and have never been able to achieve it, UNTIL I got this little wonder.  </li>
      <li>I sprayed hairspray on my hair to keep the curl (even though I didn&#x27;t need to - the curls stood until I had to wash my hair) and it was not hard at all.</li>
      <li>I got my item looking brand new</li>
      <li>I have never spent this much money on a hair styling tool.</li>
      <li>Normally, I wear my hair straight, but I live in a humid area, and in the summertime, I often let it just dry naturally.  </li>
      <li>So far no problem</li>
      <li>Well, my hair takes very easily to different hairstyles, so the Revlon worked very well</li>
      <li>When I received HSI PROFESSIONAL  </li>
      <li>You know this because the LED light changes from a solid blue to a green color.</li>
      <li>ITS AMAZING WHAT THIS WAND CAN DO ITS A LITTLE DIFFICULT AT FIRST</li>
      <li>This curling iron works very well, just as described in previous reviews.  </li>

<li> Works fine, just disappointed I didn&#x27;t hit the jackpot.</li>
<li> She has thick long hair and that was no problem for this curling iron.</li>
<li> With the Revlon curling iron, my hair would get a little stiff after spraying hairspray.</li>
<li> I was skeptical about buying this, but no regrets!!!</li>
<li> Alas, I was one of those who received just the single barrel version.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s hard to work with your hair with the glove on.</li>
<li> The only problem is that the gloves are NOT heat proof which was disappointing</li>
<li> it was so expensive.</li>

    <li> Unfortunately, due to many of these reviews, I anticipated receiving the mult-barrel version. Alas, I was one of those who received just the single barrel version. Works fine, just disappointed I didn&#x27;t hit the jackpot.</li>
    <li> When I received HSI PROFESSIONAL  it was very good there is many options ,nice design easy to use ,the most thing I like it the new technology &amp; the packing was wonderful , at the end the result is perfect , all my family, all friends they  like it  ,and most of them  ask me to bring HSI PROFESSIONAL  for them</li>
    <li> So far I am enjoying my curling wand. The service was great.  I got my item looking brand new and it didn&#x27;t take long to be shipped and received.  I plan on order HSI blow dryer as well.</li>
    <li> This is a really great item for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;It has a glove which helps a lot and which I love. Curls stay in place for a long time and I have straight difficult to curl hair!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;It looks and performs as a high end product and is so very reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend it and I tried lots and lots of different products!</li>
    <li> I always wondered how people got those curls and now I can get them too.  The only negative is the glove, you really need to wear it so you don&#x27;t burn yourself but it&#x27;s hard to work with your hair with the glove on.</li>
    <li> Has a short dosent stay heated. Very dissapointed bc it was so expensive. Would not buy! Temp keeps changing while just sitting there...down and up</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great wand!  It heats fast and works great! Easy to travel with. Just be careful not to burn yourself!</li>
    <li> Gives hair lovely curls and waves!  The only problem is that the gloves are NOT heat proof which was disappointing</li>
    <li> Normally, I wear my hair straight, but I live in a humid area, and in the summertime, I often let it just dry naturally.  When I do, it doesn&#x27;t exactly look great!  So, I decided to try this curling iron.  I&#x27;ve tried many others in an attempt to get that slightly wavy, curly \\&quot;beach hair\\&quot; look that looks so natural on everyone else, and have never been able to achieve it, UNTIL I got this little wonder.  Don&#x27;t know what the difference is, but man, it does the trick!  It&#x27;s very easy to use, thanks to the great little heat protectant glove for your hand, and it curls your hair perfectly.  I read the instructions and did exactly what it said, and voila, perfect beachy waves.  It&#x27;s quick and you don&#x27;t have to do many curls, just the top layer of your hair.  I love it!  Highly recommend this iron to all of you have tried a million others and given up like I had!</li>
    <li> Its a good product, quick warm up, but time consuming . it takes along time to.get hair really nice. over all good product.</li>
    <li> I bought this curling iron for my girlfriend and I must say it is amazing! She used it right after I gave it to her and it works wonders on hair. She has thick long hair and that was no problem for this curling iron. It creates beautiful curls! The iron itself heats up quite fast and is comfortable to hold in hand. My girlfriend and I were very impressed by the quality of this product and have since then bought other things from the company. Highly recommend this company and its products!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to buy this curling iron because I love how the clipless barrels give your hair a natural wave. I had found I liked the larger barrel size as I have medium-long hair. After about two weeks a ERROR message was showing up on the curling iron when I had the largest barrel in. I tried everything from adjusting the heat to unplugging it and nothing worked. Amazon took it back and I ordered another brand and it looks identical. So far no problem but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re all made in China and rip offs from each other. Keep the box incase it breaks so you can send it back.</li>
    <li> I have never spent this much money on a hair styling tool. It&#x27;s not even like this is &amp;#34;SO MUCH MONEY&amp;#34;. For what you get in this box, the price is so worth it. I was used to curling my hair with the Revlon curling iron from Walmart that cost $12. Well, my hair takes very easily to different hairstyles, so the Revlon worked very well (if you&#x27;re on a budget), but this curling iron is just .. so much better. It leaves your hair silky and shiny! I sprayed hairspray on my hair to keep the curl (even though I didn&#x27;t need to - the curls stood until I had to wash my hair) and it was not hard at all. With the Revlon curling iron, my hair would get a little stiff after spraying hairspray. This curling iron just makes all the difference! Also, it heats up so quickly! I used it at 400 degrees, and it heated up after about a minute. ALSO, as you are curling your hair, the curling iron itself is bound to lose heat, but this curling iron starts heating up again. You know this because the LED light changes from a solid blue to a green color. When it is off, it turns red. Buy this! Don&#x27;t hesitate.</li>
    <li> I purchased the single barrel wand. I like the temperature control on the wand so that it doesn&#x27;t burn your hair. Its a plus that the glove came with it. I plan on buying another one as a gift for my sister.</li>
    <li> I have bought several curling irons (ranging from $20 - $100) but this one knocks all of them out of the ball park. My curls hold all day. If you are searching for the perfect curling iron then search no more because this is the one and the price is right (this could sell for a lot more).</li>
    <li> I just purchased this product last week and I love it.  I did my niece&#x27;s hair and my hair for her graduation and the results were great.</li>
    <li> ITS AMAZING WHAT THIS WAND CAN DO ITS A LITTLE DIFFICULT AT FIRST BUT ONCE YOU GET THE HANG OF IT. IT WAS LIKE A CHARM I MUST WARN IT GETS REALLY HOT BUT OT LEAVES YOUR HAIR BEAUTIFUL THEN EVER</li>
    <li> No grip to hold the hair in place to curl it, I am African American and my texture hair is not for this curling iron.</li>
    <li> This curling iron works very well, just as described in previous reviews.  The only thing I wished I&#x27;d known was how to turn it on.  The instructions don&#x27;t explain that you need to hold down the power button and simultaneously push the + button.  Once I figured that out, it worked like a charm.</li>
    <li> This iron gets very very hot! Be careful! That aside, awesome tool and provided exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I have the flat irons and loved them so I decided to try the curling irons and they are great. They work just as well as the Chi irons with have the price.</li>
    <li> HSI is really a great product. My wife loves this and uses it almost daily. Still working like mew! Thanks</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;m still getting used to it. But it works. It heats up fast and gets real hot. The glove that&#x27;s included is not only handy but necessary as I am new to wand curling my hair. I have 2 burns from not wearing the glove :) the only thing is I wish I had more attachments. Like different size barrels that I could enter change. That&#x27;s the only real down side. But it&#x27;s cheaper than a lot of wands I was looking at so that&#x27;s a plus. :)</li>
    <li> I love this product so much!!!! Thick wavy hair into perfect beach waves!! You tube videos for help!!! I was skeptical about buying this, but no regrets!!!</li>
