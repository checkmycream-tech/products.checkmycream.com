    <li> Deep Sea Cosmetics Energizing body butter is the best body cream I have ever used. Put it on and your skin stays soft all day long until you wash it off. My skin stays as soft as silk. I like the fresh smell of the green tea and cucumber. I ordered two jars the last time I ordered and gave my sister one jar. I will be buying more of this. It lasts a long time too. If you ever try it you will be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item at the mall kiosk many times.  The lotion I received in the mail was OK but not as rich and thick as my previous purchases.</li>
    <li> I started buying this product back in early summer of 2011 and once I used it I loved it! After using this, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to lotions again. They just don&#x27;t compare. This body butter goes on smooth and absorbs well into your skin. It also works great on winter dry hands. The scent is very subtle, and won&#x27;t interfere with the cologne you may wear. I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. I tried the Lavender and Calendula scent and it is nice, but I like the Cucumber and Green Tea Body Butter the best. Try it, you&#x27;ll say bye bye to your bottle of body lotion! I bought my first jar at the kiosk in the mall that sold Deep Sea Cosmetics. Then I discovered that it could be purchased from Amazon at a much more affordable price. Its all good![[ASIN:B000VG01K2 Deep Sea Cosmetics Energizing body butter - green tea and cucumber]]</li>
    <li> I started using their body scrub, body butter, and hand/body lotion over a year ago and just love the line. My elbows and feet are \\&quot;smooth as buttah\\&quot;. Funny, I started running out of everything about the same time, so they last about a year. I first bought from DS Cosmetics kiosk at the mall and it was MUCH more expensive than at Yahoo. Now, it&#x27;s even more economical. I compared the full label, aroma, etc, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the same. In short - LOVE the line.</li>
    <li> This product is no better than a lotion you can buy at Walmart.  A few years ago I bought this from a vendor at a mall.  It was luxurious, made with a variety of oils and other  natural ingredients.  I have VERY dry skin and I could tell the difference from the original product even at the end of the day.  My most recent purchase will be returned.</li>
    <li> love this stuff! Leaves your skin so soft, my husband loved it also.  Works well on the whole body, dry skin doesn&#x27;t stand a chance with this body butter.  I got the green tea and cucumber which is a nice clean and refreshing smell.</li>
    <li> Before using this cream, my hands in winter months, were so red and cracked, I had to take Ibuprofen for pain and soreness.  Cracks around my fingertips were so bad I had to use band aids.  I discovered this cream at a mall kiosk, and it&#x27;s one of the best things that has ever happened to me.  Believe me when I say I had tried just about everything on the market.  Even went to a dermatologist.  And for the first time in my life, I had LONG healthy nails.  I start using it on a daily basis in October.</li>
    <li> Once you try this, you will wonder how you did without it.  I&#x27;m hooked in it.  Very soothing after a hot bath.</li>
    <li> Like their other products they have cut down on the ingredients I&#x27;m guessing to save some costs. For a man with weather beaten hands I might not suggest this product to you guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My medicine cabinet is filled with hand lotions I don&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still searching for the right product. When I find it I&#x27;ll buy a few cases.</li>
    <li> MAKES YOUR SKIN FEEL GREAT. LIKE NEW. LOVE IT. IS NOT GREASY AND HELPS AID IN DRY SKIN. SHIPPING IS FAST. THE COMPANY IS WONDERFUL. ITS A GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the other cremes from Deep Sea, etc.  This one beats all.  It&#x27;s better than the Origins product I used to buy. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy, just glowing and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I love this product. First time I purchased it at a mall and paid a lot more for it, I really liked it so tried amazon and they had it for a lot less. Use it daily and it has really helped with my dry skin. I would recommend this if your skin is dry.</li>
    <li> This is my third purchase, which brings me to a total of 10.  As I said my family only use these. They are lightweight yet super nourishing.  Compare to $50 you need to spent in the mall, this is a great bargain!  Recommend to all buyers!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Will continue to use and purchase it. Very good to find a product worth sticking with. Most of the time we just waste our money.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and met all my expectations.</li>
    <li> Love the product, thanks. People who are not deep sea users, give it a try you will really like it.</li>
    <li> My mom gave me some of this in a green-ish color for Eczema but I forget the exact one. It smelled good, a little girly for me but, it worked very well and much better than any other lotion or cream I have used except antibiotic ointment like Neosporin. Steroid creams and Working Hands helped but not as good as this DSM. Neosporin worked best over the counter but it was the prednisone steroid prescription (i believe) that instantly cleared it up. The eczema has not returned since. I think the Eczema was caused by some allergic reaction to a plant. I had absolutely no issues with the prescription and would take it again if I needed to and prescribed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lost my original DSM to the TSA agents so I purchased this cucumber green tea. I didnt see the same one I had on Amazon by color but didn&#x27;t know the scent. I could not tell for sure what color this was due to the poor quality pictures. The picture looks a bit green but the product is actually white. I don&#x27;t like the smell and this one only works half as good as my other one.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes one&#x27;s body feel so soft and smell so great!  My skin feels deprived without it!  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is very close to a VERY favorite Deep Sea Body Cream that has been discontinued and cannot buy any longer.  The closest I&#x27;ve found.  The price is less than the other, as well.  So all in all, I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love deep sea products and this is A Number 1 ! I use this after I use the deep sea scrub which is also amazing and my skin is so so soft.</li>
