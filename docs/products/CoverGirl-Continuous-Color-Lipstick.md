<li> I have looked high and low for this product in all the local drug stores and big store chains.  </li>
<li> They go on smoothly, don&#x27;t dry out my lips and the color actually stays on for hours.  </li>
<li> If you don&#x27;t have sensitive lips then you may really like this product, but it&#x27;s a big fail for me.</li>
<li> I bought this lipstick based on reviews from other users, but obviously one shouldn&#x27;t go by other reviews, because colors are such a personal choice.  </li>
<li> I will try other colors, but perhaps not online.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not as long-lasting as other lipsticks of a similar ilk, but what is worse is that, after a couple of weeks of wear, it has made my lips extremely sore, extremely dry and they are now peeling.  </li>
<li> And now I have to hunt it down because it has been discontinued.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a mess.  </li>
<li> The color was close but not the same as my old lipstick, and the taste and consistency is awful.  </li>
<li> Its thick and greasy</li>
<li> The colour is subtle and I like the mother of pearl shine in it.  </li>
<li> False advertising.</li>
<li> In my book, that is illegal.</li>
<li> So sad Cover Girl discontinued it.</li>
<li> This is a lipstick I have been wearing for years until the stores took it off the shelf which was very frustrating</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is all I have used for a decade now. I like the way it looks. I like the way it feels. I use it like chapstick. And now I have to hunt it down because it has been discontinued. Keep selling it, Amazon!</li>
    <li> False advertising. Says \\&quot;pack of 2\\&quot;. Not! Only one was shipped. In my book, that is illegal. AmericaRX dot com will be removed from my sellers list. I don&#x27;t like liars.</li>
    <li> I have looked high and low for this product in all the local drug stores and big store chains.  Finally researched it on the Cover Girl Website and find it is now discontinued.  Thank goodness I was able to order it by mail through Amazon.  Amazon always saves the day on many discontinued items.  Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> I cannot find this lipstick in stores so was thrilled when my sister found it online. This is the only lipstick that does not turn to a darker color on my lips. I love this one and 010. I hope they continue making these two lipsticks!</li>
    <li> Cover Girl continuous lipstick makes my lips feel silky and soft. I love the fact that it comes in so many beautiful colors.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and all of a sudden this shade and case were no longer on the shelves at the retailer. Turns out I can still buy it on-line and ordered a supply just in case it disappears altogether!  Great color, great quality for the price...shipment was fast.  All around five stars!</li>
    <li> I was afraid I might never find this lipstick again, so I am very happy to be able to buy it!  I have worn it for years, and I have never found a pink lipstick that is that &amp;#34;exact&amp;#34; perfect pink like this one is!</li>

    <li> I love the Covergirl lipsticks -very smooth application and the colours don&#x27;t change. I&#x27;ve been using Covergirl products for some years now and they always deliver.</li>
    <li> Like everyone else, I&#x27;m having to cut-back on spending. Therefore, instead of buying my fav. Estee Lauder products, I went to the store with coupons in hand and purchased 4 tubes of CoverGirl Continuous Color: 2-Sugar Almond, 1-Rose Quartz and 1-Bronzed Peach. I am beyond shocked - these are great!!!  They go on smoothly, don&#x27;t dry out my lips and the color actually stays on for hours.  I am very impressed with it, and even more impressed when I receive Sunday-paper coupons and save money on CoverGirl products.  This is my new favorite lipstick and naturally, as is my luck, it must have been discontinued in stores since most all other reviewers say that it did.  I must have lucked up and gotten the last of them at the huge smiley-face store. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I did NOT purchase the lipstick from Amazon, I felt like I needed to give it a good review.

It&#x27;s not as long-lasting as other lipsticks of a similar ilk, but what is worse is that, after a couple of weeks of wear, it has made my lips extremely sore, extremely dry and they are now peeling.  And nothing is helping to soothe them.  It&#x27;s a mess.  I do find I&#x27;m extremely sensitive to several lipsticks - ones containing gloss or moisturizer, for example - but this is the first long-lasting lippy I&#x27;ve had a problem with.  There&#x27;s definitely some ingredient(s) to which I&#x27;m allergic.  If you don&#x27;t have sensitive lips then you may really like this product, but it&#x27;s a big fail for me.</li>
    <li> Great lipstick that I&#x27;ve been using for years. So sad Cover Girl discontinued it. Happy I found some here. I stocked up...thanks Amazon for always having what I need!</li>

    <li> I have been using it for years with a lip liner.  It is the best combination for my complexion and look. The colour is subtle and I like the mother of pearl shine in it.  I hope they keep producing it until I am around.</li>
    <li> always use the same color love cover girl</li>
