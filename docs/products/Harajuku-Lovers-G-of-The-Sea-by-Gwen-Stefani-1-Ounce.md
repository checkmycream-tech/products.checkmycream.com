<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a really nice-fresh fragrance, like a candy but not a sweet boring candy.</li>
<li> I have been looking for this for a while,but some people were selling it for crazy prices.</li>

It&#x27;s like an apple candy, a fresh apple candy, because it&#x27;s not cloying like classic sweet-candy but it&#x27;s not too floral-fresh either. It&#x27;s a really great smell.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if this scent can be the &amp;#34;signature fragrance&amp;#34; of someone but it&#x27;s nice to use in summer-spring days, you can take the little bottle with you in your purse and spray it wherever you are.&lt;br /&gt;This kind of smell could be great as a shampoo or body lotion or bodymist because it&#x27;s soft and nice for any girl or woman</li>

Two stars for cuteness, three for aroma.</li>
