### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the greatest mascara ever!  </li>
      <li>THIS IS THE BEST MASCARA</li>
      <li>After using supposedly the best drug store mascara for years and looking like a racoon at the end of the day, I saw this in a listmania list and all the 5 star ratings got me to buy it.</li>
      <li>and yes this is the best won&#x27;t move from your eyes or run and stays</li>
      <li>and you be saying what iA&#x27;m saying the best is dior</li>
      <li>This takes the fewest coats and looks the best.</li>
      <li>This application method I would not wear to work but for evening, its perfect.</li>
      <li>Amazon gave me excellent service.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used, including department store brands.  </li>
      <li>The best mascara - and</li>
      <li>I had seen an advertisement in a magazine &amp; was impressed with the volume that it claimed to give the customer - the photos looked amazing!</li>
      <li>Beautiful lashes with lots of compliments.  </li>
      <li>, they look great.</li>
      <li>This mascara is great.</li>
      <li>I love it!!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s good to go, never a touch up.</li>
      <li>Ok - this is a great mascara - not clumpy, not gooey, volumizing,</li>
      <li>Your lashes aren&#x27;t going to magically thicken or grow, but you will still look great by the end of the day.</li>
      <li>Gotta love Diorshow!</li>
      <li>Will be buying again for sure!</li>
      <li>This is my favorite mascara!  </li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>Great product, goes on real smooth and easy.</li>
      <li>, Basically, it dries out on you, but i would still buy it, because in the beginning it is so amazing</li>
      <li>Honestly, I&#x27;d say save your money and head to the drugstore.</li>
      <li>Despite the price, I was seduced into buying this mascara by a number of effectively misleading ads.</li>
      <li>but I would like to see a super lengthening/plumping mascara w/Diorshow&#x27;s great properties.</li>
      <li>This is the most amazing mascara I have ever used.</li>
      <li>It has its pros and cons just like any product, but it&#x27;s the best mascara I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
      <li>This is the best mascara I have found so far, and I&#x27;ve tried many kinds.  </li>
      <li>: this is perfect to use if you are in the habit of using two mascara&#x27;s (a lengthening and a volumizing together) for dramatic look; The best combination I&#x27;ve found is to use is a couple swipes of maybelline \\&quot;define-a-lash\\</li>
      <li>One quick coat &amp; you are done for the day &amp; night!!</li>
      <li>The nice thing is it is easy to remove and it doesnt take your eyelashes with it when you remove it.</li>
      <li>I love high-end beauty products and this one is no exception.</li>
      <li>Came across this one Dior and fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>I love the brush on this mascara.  </li>
      <li>OMG.. Love it..</li>
      <li>It applies okay overall nothing overly impressive.</li>
      <li>I wanted to try Diorshow however because I&#x27;d heard so many good things about it and thought it might be worth it.</li>
      <li>every lash- but for anyone that isn&#x27;t skilled at applying mascara-</li>
      <li>I love it for a staple mascara</li>
      <li>buy 2, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
      <li>My favorite thing about this mascara is that it doesn&#x27;t ever smudge off, it stays put until you wash it off.  </li>
      <li>and then on top of that immediately applied the Diorshow.</li>
      <li>I love makeup and try a bunch</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve since found MUCH better mascaras at a fraction of the cost.</li>
      <li>It is one of the better mascaras on the market.  </li>
      <li>But as I&#x27;ve discovered, this mascara along with many others, has</li>
      <li>I was able to deal with the huge brush</li>
      <li>But most importantly-</li>
      <li>lashes\\&quot; is length and most importantly...  </li>
      <li>I think my good old Maybelline Full N Soft does the best job of any mascara out there.  </li>
      <li>However, Dior&#x27;s Diorshow Mascara is, hands down, the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>
      <li>It is a pretty good mascara, and the floral scent is nice, but it&#x27;s really not that amazing.  </li>
      <li>I feel like when I&#x27;m putting it on its like a huge bumble bee with out the buzzing.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth..</li>
      <li>It definately is a great mascara - but does not last or preserve well at all.</li>
      <li>DiorShow is worth the money!</li>
      <li>I tried DiorShow Blackout first and fell in love.  </li>
      <li>DiorShow wins!</li>
      <li>I really expected great things from this mascara;</li>
      <li>A true test of it was when I forgot and wore it to the gym</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and this mascara really lengthens and makes my eyelashes stand out!</li>
      <li>im pretty much the pickiest mascara wearer ever, but i really love this stuff, it goes on like butter.</li>
      <li>Worth it if money is no object.  </li>
      <li>Diorshow is fun to try once, but I&#x27;m not dropping $23</li>
      <li>This mascara stays un-clumpy for between 4 and 6 months, making it worth the money.  </li>
      <li>worth the price.  </li>
      <li>You could feel confident to wear it in a professional environment if your job is conservative and not feel overly made up.</li>
      <li>worth the money .</li>
      <li>I mean, it&#x27;s still good - still Dior, but I think Blackout gave me much more longer and thicker lashes and never smudged.</li>
      <li>It goes on easy and clump free, giving you long, full, and seperated lashes.  </li>
      <li>, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
      <li>like you did in the first week</li>
      <li>I will keep buying this mascara for a long time :)</li>
      <li>&quot; make sure lashes are seperated,let dry momentarily(don&#x27;t</li>
      <li>For the money Estee Lauder&#x27;s More Than Mascara wins hands down.  </li>
      <li>#1 the brush is EXTREMELY large</li>
      <li>The price was very high and the product was nothing as advertised.  </li>
      <li>put the whole times till your ready to take it off</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very picky about mascara.  </li>
      <li>Plus, about 1/3 of the cost and lasts much longer.</li>
      <li>I really like this mascara</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad to finally find one that works since it really matter I have long full lashes</li>
      <li>Perhaps other customers had better luck with the product.</li>
      <li>Although the cost is higher than what you would pay at the local drug store I think it is definately worth it.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many different brands and types of mascara over the years to help lengthen my short straight stubby lashes.</li>
      <li>Lashes look a little thicker and longer, but the big thing is by the end of the day, your lashes still look good and no racoon.</li>
      <li>the wand is huge too, which helps your eyelashes not look nasty and clumpy, pretty much the best mascara ever.</li>
      <li>If money is no object for youI would highly reccomend this mascara.</li>
      <li>I have also used the Dior Blackout, but I find this one just a little bit better....</li>
      <li>make one&#x27;s eyelashes look full and long.  </li>
      <li>Can you say full long lashes ..</li>
      <li>So my recommendation is Diorshow alone just for normal wear</li>
      <li>and then when you need something a little more dramatic, use Diorshow in conjunction with a good \\&quot;tip\\&quot; mascara.</li>
      <li>I recently purchased DiorShow Mascara in black and it lives up to most of the positive reviews I have seen for it.</li>
      <li>I need new mascara.</li>
      <li>and then carefully apply the Dior on top (without overdoing obviously, or you&#x27;ll get spiderlashes).</li>
      <li>I was very surprised that this product was not at all what I thought it would be.  </li>
      <li>After reading several magazine reviews for this product I decided to give it a try, all my other favorite products have been discontinued.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is one of the better mascaras on the market.  When you curl your eyelashes, and brush this on, it enhances your lashes while keeping the curl.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed in this product but it was not the fault of Amazon. Amazon gave me excellent service. I had seen an advertisement in a magazine &amp; was impressed with the volume that it claimed to give the customer - the photos looked amazing! When I used the product it did not give me the volume I was looking for. Perhaps other customers had better luck with the product.</li>
    <li> Love this! I have also used the Dior Blackout, but I find this one just a little bit better....I have fine hair and this mascara really lengthens and makes my eyelashes stand out! Will be buying again for sure!</li>
    <li> in the beginning, wow, boom bam, goes your lashes, after a month, youll need like 10 coats of mascara to come somewhat close like you did in the first week, Basically, it dries out on you, but i would still buy it, because in the beginning it is so amazing</li>
    <li> Ok - this is a great mascara - not clumpy, not gooey, volumizing, no flaking - FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS :(  And then it dries out and you feel like there is no product left or you just can&#x27;t get enough on your lashes. For the amount of money - I would hope that it would last a little longer. It definately is a great mascara - but does not last or preserve well at all. The best mascara - and I love makeup and try a bunch - is Max Factor 2000 plus. Plus, about 1/3 of the cost and lasts much longer.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different brands and types of mascara over the years to help lengthen my short straight stubby lashes. This takes the fewest coats and looks the best. DiorShow is worth the money!</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t seen this mascara before I bought it online and I have to say I&#x27;m petite and the wand is gigantic! I feel like when I&#x27;m putting it on its like a huge bumble bee with out the buzzing. It applies okay overall nothing overly impressive. I think I&#x27;ll stick to my Lancome Definicils.</li>
    <li> For the money Estee Lauder&#x27;s More Than Mascara wins hands down.  I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased DiorShow Mascara in black and it lives up to most of the positive reviews I have seen for it. It truly does lengthen and its not overly heavy in appearance. You could feel confident to wear it in a professional environment if your job is conservative and not feel overly made up. What I ended up doing with it is using it in conjunction with a standard Loreal lengthening product. I used the white \\&quot;tips\\&quot; for extra length and then on top of that immediately applied the Diorshow. This gave me ultra dramatic volume and length. This application method I would not wear to work but for evening, its perfect. So my recommendation is Diorshow alone just for normal wear and then when you need something a little more dramatic, use Diorshow in conjunction with a good \\&quot;tip\\&quot; mascara. What I mean by \\&quot;tip\\&quot; is any mascara that is white and coats for length.</li>
    <li> I was able to deal with the huge brush and I do admit that it really plumps up one&#x27;s lashes, but the excessive amount of fragrance in the formula made my eyes water. I had to exchange it for my old standby - Lancome Definicils.</li>
    <li> After using supposedly the best drug store mascara for years and looking like a racoon at the end of the day, I saw this in a listmania list and all the 5 star ratings got me to buy it. I was a little nervous about it not being waterproof, because I wear contacts and I tear a lot, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter. This mascara is great. Lashes look a little thicker and longer, but the big thing is by the end of the day, your lashes still look good and no racoon. AND absolutely no flaking, smudging, or racooning even when I tear. Your lashes aren&#x27;t going to magically thicken or grow, but you will still look great by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing mascara I have ever used. I love it!! It stays put, does not smudge or smear AT ALL.  I have dry eyes &amp; use eye drops quite frequently &amp; this mascara, although not waterproof, stays put!  You barely have to touch your eyelashes with this stuff &amp; WOW, they look great. One quick coat &amp; you are done for the day &amp; night!!</li>
    <li> Gotta love Diorshow! My staple mascara. It&#x27;s your basic mascara, it doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes anything worthy of the word miraculous, but it doesn&#x27;t flake or fall down on my dark circles like other mascaras. I wear it all day and it&#x27;s good to go, never a touch up. I love it for a staple mascara but I would like to see a super lengthening/plumping mascara w/Diorshow&#x27;s great properties.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised that this product was not at all what I thought it would be.  I felt as though I had been ripped off.  The price was very high and the product was nothing as advertised.  The brush is very large which made it difficult to spread on my lashes without getting on my eye lids. The color was not as black as advertised. I should have just stuck to my Maybeline mascara.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a masacara fiend and have tried them all; drug store mascara to department store. This one beats them all. It thickens and lengthens beautifully, not to mention curling. I never curl my lashes beforehand either. I have a curler but just find it to be too much trouble. It stays put well with too much smudgeing and smells like expensive perfum. A true test of it was when I forgot and wore it to the gym and it was still in place after a 3 mile run!</li>
    <li> OMG.. Love it.. Can you say full long lashes ..i never want to use anything else</li>
    <li> I am a mascara FREAK, so I just had to try Diorshow after all the hype it&#x27;s been getting.  It is a pretty good mascara, and the floral scent is nice, but it&#x27;s really not that amazing.  I think my good old Maybelline Full N Soft does the best job of any mascara out there.  Diorshow is fun to try once, but I&#x27;m not dropping $23 everytime I need new mascara.</li>
    <li> worth the price.  creates thick dark eye lashes.  make one&#x27;s eyelashes look full and long.  expensive and dries up quickly so use it and enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I love the brush on this mascara.  However, I don&#x27;t think the coverage is enough.  I like a lot of lashes.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara!  It goes on easy and clump free, giving you long, full, and seperated lashes.  Beautiful lashes with lots of compliments.  The nice thing is it is easy to remove and it doesnt take your eyelashes with it when you remove it.</li>
    <li> I have compare it to lancome and yes this is the best won&#x27;t move from your eyes or run and stays put the whole times till your ready to take it off I&#x27;m glad to finally find one that works since it really matter I have long full lashes so I needed the mascara to stay on my lashes and not under my eyes like the new lancome mascara vertol which does if you never want to waste your time and money get this one and you be saying what iA&#x27;m saying the best is dior</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I have found so far, and I&#x27;ve tried many kinds.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because of the brush, I wish it was curved or smaller, making it easier to apply even coverage.  My favorite thing about this mascara is that it doesn&#x27;t ever smudge off, it stays put until you wash it off.  This mascara stays un-clumpy for between 4 and 6 months, making it worth the money.  I will keep buying this mascara for a long time :)</li>
    <li> im pretty much the pickiest mascara wearer ever, but i really love this stuff, it goes on like butter. the wand is huge too, which helps your eyelashes not look nasty and clumpy, pretty much the best mascara ever. buy 2, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product at all ! The mascara did not go on smoothly, it was clumpy and required me to use a brush to make it look \\&quot;somewhat\\&quot; natural, it&#x27;s very heavy masacra. At the end of the day I had little black flakes under my eyes.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST MASCARA SO FAR, TRIED ALL MAC, COVER GIRL, REVLON, CHANNEL YOU NAME IT, SO LONG FAKE EYE LASHES I&#x27;M STICKING TO DIOR, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> Dramatic, doesn&#x27;t clump, goes on very nicely, no smudging.  Has a chemical smell, but it goes away after it dries. It&#x27;s the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used, including department store brands.  The only reason I only gave it 4 stars is price, but I haven&#x27;t yet seen how long it will last.  Worth it if money is no object.  I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> This mascara definitely works at creating a longer lash look. Goes on smooth..no clumps and lasts all day. I have bought again and wil buy again in future. worth the money .</li>
    <li> I have used others well known brands, usually buy at department stores. Came across this one Dior and fell in love with it. Great product, goes on real smooth and easy.</li>
    <li> Despite the price, I was seduced into buying this mascara by a number of effectively misleading ads. While it wasn&#x27;t terrible, it certainly didn&#x27;t live up to expectations, the hype, or the high cost. I found the mascara exceedingly thick and very prone to clumping if I didn&#x27;t first rigorously scrape the excess from the brush (a bit of a pain, and a problem I&#x27;ve not had with many other mascaras, even drugstore brands). It also had a tendency to flake after only a few hours, had a strange smell, and made my eyes burn slightly upon application (again, a pain, and a problem I&#x27;ve not often had).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, just to note, I&#x27;ve been wearing and applying mascara for well over a decade at this point, so it&#x27;s not as if I&#x27;m simply ignorant of the proper procedure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Overall, I was unimpressed. I&#x27;ve since found MUCH better mascaras at a fraction of the cost. Honestly, I&#x27;d say save your money and head to the drugstore.</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara but doubt I would shell out the cash for it again.  I just had to try it because I had been reading about it.  If money is no object for youI would highly reccomend this mascara.</li>
    <li> I love high-end beauty products and this one is no exception. It has its pros and cons just like any product, but it&#x27;s the best mascara I&#x27;ve tried so far. I have half-decent lashes to start with, but this mascara really does get them long, lush and dramatic the way I like them! It can be a bit clumpy if you&#x27;re not careful, but that&#x27;s nothing a careful application and an eyelash comb can&#x27;t fix. With that said, this product probably isn&#x27;t for the casual makeup wearer. It comes off completely and easily with water and your usual face wash, but that also means you have to be careful if you cry. The first dramatic mascara I tried was Benefit&#x27;s BagGal Lash, but I found that it didn&#x27;t get my lashes as thick as DiorShow, and it dried out very quickly, within a month (and no, I do not pump the wand!) DiorShow wins! I am now a repeat customer. I give it about a 4 1/2 out of 5.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest mascara ever!  It makes your eyelashes look as thick and beautiful as false eyelashes.</li>
    <li> After reading several magazine reviews for this product I decided to give it a try, all my other favorite products have been discontinued.  Although the cost is higher than what you would pay at the local drug store I think it is definately worth it.  No bleed all day!!! The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I was hoping it would make my lashes REALLY long, and it just does long.  I do love it enough to keep buying it, no more messing around with drug store or counter brands.</li>
    <li> The way everyone raves about this mascara you&#x27;d think it&#x27;d be the end all be all- but the fact is, it&#x27;s just not. For such a hefty price and the Dior label behind it- I really expected great things from this mascara; But as I&#x27;ve discovered, this mascara along with many others, has it&#x27;s limits.  #1 the brush is EXTREMELY large (long /wide)- I guess the point of that is to provide for lift and to coat every lash- but for anyone that isn&#x27;t skilled at applying mascara- and even those that are- applying becomes an arduous task (especially for lower lashes).It is the same shape on both sides- the picture looks decieving.  #2 this mascara does not lengthen- I don&#x27;t think it claims to anyway- but half of the affect of \\&quot;the look of false lashes\\&quot; is length and most importantly...  #3 if you try to get the tops of lashes the mascara CLUMPS; it&#x27;s this last attribute that seriously dissapointed me- which brings me back to the idea that maybe all mascaras have their limits. Too bad too..Along with the clumping it does not seperate the lashes well- and when I ran a eyelash comb through, it made my eyelashes \\&quot;wire out\\&quot; -not very flattering.  Now for the pro&#x27;s of Dior Show: it does thicken (but you have to do it just so to avoid as much as possible things stated above). But most importantly- why I still gave it three stars- is b/c it lasts through the day- your eyelashes will not \\&quot;fall\\&quot; by the end of the day/night- which is a huge plus; But don&#x27;t expect dramatic false looking lashes unless you are already born with naturally curling long lashes and you have the time to be very precise.    6/6/07 update: this is perfect to use if you are in the habit of using two mascara&#x27;s (a lengthening and a volumizing together) for dramatic look; The best combination I&#x27;ve found is to use is a couple swipes of maybelline \\&quot;define-a-lash\\&quot; make sure lashes are seperated,let dry momentarily(don&#x27;t wait too long)- and then carefully apply the Dior on top (without overdoing obviously, or you&#x27;ll get spiderlashes). This has worked wonders for me with the maybelline achieving length and seperation and the Dior giving volume and hold.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very picky about mascara.  However, Dior&#x27;s Diorshow Mascara is, hands down, the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used!  It makes me look like I have false lashes on.  I will NEVER use another brand of mascara!</li>
    <li> I tried DiorShow Blackout first and fell in love.  I wanted to try Diorshow however because I&#x27;d heard so many good things about it and thought it might be worth it. I have to say I&#x27;m very disappointed - I mean, it&#x27;s still good - still Dior, but I think Blackout gave me much more longer and thicker lashes and never smudged. Diorshow however always runs when I cry which is so unbecoming! If you are stuck between Blackout and Diorshow, I&#x27;d say go with Blackout.</li>
