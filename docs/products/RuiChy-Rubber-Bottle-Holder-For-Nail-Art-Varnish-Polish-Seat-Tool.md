<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great with nail polish.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Very small.</li>
    <li> Soft plastic, hugs the bottle Nicely. Took a little long to receive, worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Thank these are the best i could ever find nothing like these here in my town i would of had to asked my nail tech to buy them for me but i used Amazon i love their web site thank u much.</li>
    <li> gifts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my sister and her kids like them..</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this item it sits well on a flat top area like a table or my dinner tray. I love it.</li>
    <li> Works just as expected.</li>
    <li> this nail polish holder works great keeps me from smearing polish on my nails</li>
    <li> Bought for daughters x-mas stocking.she loved them.no more accidental spilling of nail polish.</li>
    <li> Says one round and one oval bottle holder. Not truth ful. They sent me two round ones.</li>
    <li> My 12 y.o. Grand Daughter live across the country from me and wanted get her these since she is in the nail polish styling almost every day.  She like other was doing that juggling act of holding the bottle in one hand while trying to polish with the other hand.  She said it is now so easy to do her nails.  And since you get two holders with the purchase, she can have two colors going at on time.  She liked them.</li>
    <li> These make painting my nails so much easier!  The polish sits comfortably inside and I love that you can tilt it to get to the polish easier.</li>
    <li> Great product! Great price! Works perfect to hold primer and glue bottles upright!</li>
    <li> It sounds silly but now that I have these I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without them. There are amazing. It makes it nice when you are doing nails of a little girl. You don&#x27;t have to worry about them knocking over. And if you are like me and have sat in bed with the nail polish bottle between your knees while you paint them, ugh. With this you can pop it in and set it on your bed with no spill worries. It also stayed put when I had it on a slight incline (wouldn&#x27;t recommend, but it did stay put). Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t hold large round or square bottles. only small and minnie bottles.</li>
    <li> I like these as nail polish holders.&lt;br /&gt;They are a stiff rubber type material.&lt;br /&gt;I received a white three holed round and a small one holed pink holder.&lt;br /&gt;The white round has a removable bottom and the pink does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The annoying problem I encountered was with the size of bottles they do not accommodate especially in the tilt function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;China glaze fit good in the round three opening holder good. It securely laid almost horizontal rather then tilted which is great when almost empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seche Vite type also fit okay in the round holder. However the tilt function was not good. Had to find just the right spot for it to securely stay tilted and not pop back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither went into the smaller holder without force. Zero tilt function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried Sally Hansen Xtreme wear smaller bottle in the small holder and fit fine but when tilted kept popping back upright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have success with the smaller holder with a small round Rimmel bottle which fit perfect and tilted well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instability of the tilt function makes this product half usable for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size of these must have been molded for salon size bottles. Short and stout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would have been helpful to have the description actually say the type and size of bottle these could accommodate in the hold position and the tilt position.</li>
    <li> This product has to be one of the best things I&#x27;ve ever bought. For everyone who enjoys doing their nails a lot, this is a must! No more worries about keeping the polish in place or from falling over. As I said , this is a must have.</li>
    <li> It fits all my nail polish bottles. Do not need to worry the bottle fall and pour again. Will order more.</li>
    <li> helps keep bottles from falling over. love that they are rubber</li>
    <li> Dont bother. Barely fit even my cheap NYC bottles which are fairly small compared to OPI. Cheap plastic. I got two of the same styles, which would be the pink one in the picture. I did not receive the white one pictured. Ugh. Just putting polish on the table would be less of a headache.</li>
    <li> Love these especially at such a great price!</li>
    <li> great product, great seller</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t real care for these holders. The material isn&#x27;t very flexible and not all bottles will fit in these holders.</li>
    <li> The holders were too small it was hard getting the bottles into the holder.&lt;br /&gt;This would help getting to the polish. the bottles would not tilt.</li>
    <li> I really like these!  They keep me from accidentally knocking over my polish while I&#x27;m doing my nails and hold a well-used bottle at a nice angle so I can still get my brush full without constantly picking up the bottle and tilting it to get at the polish.</li>
    <li> GREAT ITEM THANK YOU!!</li>
    <li> Great product and affordable</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold all polish but still works !</li>
    <li> I received these yesterday but it didn&#x27;t go through I really like to give you 10 stars if I could because I think it&#x27;s really hard to paint your nails and hold the bottle thank you and God bless</li>
    <li> Only hold small bottle polishes</li>
    <li> Item is not as described in picture</li>
    <li> The white one is great, but the pink one doesn&#x27;t seem to fit most polish bottles.</li>
    <li> So glad I bought these! I needed something to keep my polishes from tipping over while I was using them without having to use both hands, and these are perfect. It is difficult to get larger bottles in &amp; out of them, but the larger bottles have less tendency to tip, so that&#x27;s just fine with me. And the slit in the front is great for putting bottles at an angle so you can get at the polish when the bottle&#x27;s running low. I&#x27;m thinking of ordering another pair for when I&#x27;m doing nail art with several different colors at once.</li>
    <li> I love these I got two of the pink kind, They hold china glaze polish really well. I am not sure about many others but I really like how easy it is to use and keep the p[olish from tipping over</li>
    <li> I love this creation. So handy</li>
    <li> These do not work as shown or described. Only holds smaller bottles of polish. Larger bottles make the plastic flare out and they wont stay. Slow shipping.Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the polish holders I got them rite in time can&#x27;t wait to order again ! Thank u so much !</li>
    <li> They were a waste of money. Only a couple of my bottles will fit in them. Glad they didn&#x27;t cost much.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t really fit most bottles</li>
    <li> Luv these! they are so convenient!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! The creator is an absolute genius.  I can&#x27;t even imagine how I ever polished my nails without these handy little tools!!!</li>
    <li> Be aware this is plastic...and when you put your bottle in it sits kinda funny but I get it cuz with all of the different shape and size nail polishes out there you would have to make it plastic...its kind quirky but works.</li>
    <li> I have used these 2t times so far and they hold the polish jars pretty well.  You can use square and round bottles.  It is better than using 2 hands for sure.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE!! i would always spilled my bottles and now that i have these lovely holder i dont worry.</li>
    <li> Love these things.  Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about my daughter knocking over her fingernail polish onto the carpet.</li>
    <li> Ya I would recommend, makes painting your nails easy when your laying in bed. There kinda rubber which I like.</li>
    <li> this was a pretty quick delivery. works great you dont have to worry about the polish spilling all over. great idea</li>
    <li> Grand daughter loved this.</li>
    <li> Bottles do not fit or work as seen</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used them a lot but I&#x27;m getting ready to do my nails so I&#x27;m hoping it will help lean over the base coat bottle that&#x27;s getting empty.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because the item just doesn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would when I ordered it...I use it sometimes, other times I don&#x27;t...</li>
    <li> These are both pretty much the same, I can&#x27;t tell which is for round and which is for oval, but I can fit all my bottles into both of them so it doesn&#x27;t make a difference. They are great, don&#x27;t know how or why I lived without them for so long! They hold bottles at the right angle for use, and for getting all the polish from the very bottom, they are rubbery so they don&#x27;t slide around on the table, and I feel like I will never again spill a bottle of polish. Yay! I use one for when I am doing my mani, and one holds my bottle of cuticle oil all the time on my kitchen table so I remember to use it throughout the day. I wish they came in more neutral colors, I&#x27;d rather have a tan and a dark brown instead of pink and bright white, but whatever. Love &#x27;em!</li>
    <li> The bottles fit a little tight but it holds them at a nice angle making it easier to paint.  I use them everyday at work.</li>
    <li> awesome products, thanks</li>
    <li> Very small and rigid openings. One of mine isn&#x27;t even the one pictured. You can only use narrow and small bottles. OPI or China Glaze bottles won&#x27;t fit. Horrible design.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish holder. It keep your nail polish from turning over and you are able to get just the right amount of polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it</li>
    <li> I ordered the oval and the round, but I received 2 ovals. They work ok, but I was wanting one of each so I&#x27;d have something that would hold all the different shape bottles I have. That&#x27;s why I only gave a 3 star rating.</li>
    <li> I received them today I thought I was going to get them next month because it said estimated time was between July 9th to July 27th so that was awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars because on the white nail polish holder the bottom keeps coming off but I guess I can try gluing it so it doesn&#x27;t come off.&lt;br /&gt;But I do appreciate that it came sooner than it said it was suppose to so thank you it does fit my polishes and that&#x27;s good because I&#x27;m tired of placing my polish on my bed and it sliding off or spilling.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth what I paid once again thank you.</li>
    <li> i got this within the week i ordered it some bottles don&#x27;t fit but its fine now i don&#x27;t have to worry about  the bottle slipping when I&#x27;m painting my nails on my lap</li>
    <li> They were exactly what i expected. I bought these because they were the cheapest around that would arrive quickly (and you got two for the price of what most other sellers offered for one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic is a little rigid (which is a good feature) However its hard to wedge a LARGER bottles into in (BUT It can be done!! ha ha)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would just recommend placing the bottles in there BEFORE you start painting your nails or run the risk of ruining your base color etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> I really liked this item. It holds your nail polish so that it won&#x27;t spill while you are using it. I got 2 of them and use them all the time. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Great idea, but not all nail polish bottles fit.</li>
    <li> Disappoint in this purchase.  I have polish bottles that did not fit.</li>
    <li> The items that I ordered were exactly what I wanted.  My daughter will be so happy to open this gift for Christmas!</li>
    <li> welcome gift by one who frequently polishes her nails</li>
    <li> They are very small and i find it hard to fit bottles in them.</li>
    <li> When i received them and can&#x27;t put OPI , ORLY. ....else polish color in. Just holder design color that fix them.&lt;br /&gt;Never buy this item again.</li>
    <li> This product is a great idea but it does not work with all polish bottles. I will use it with traditional bottles.</li>
    <li> Helpful in keeping the bottles of polish from falling over and damaging my table. It frees up both hands to now have to hang onto the bottle as you paint your nails.</li>
    <li> They are a great price and definitely help me while I do my nails. Sometimes I do my nails while I&#x27;m on the bed so they definitely hold my nail polishes upright without falling over. Makes my life easier!</li>
    <li> These are Christmas gifts for my young grand daughter….seem like they will be great for her and help with spills.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE these!  So much better than trying to hold a bottle of polish between your knees!  Great gifts for anyone who polishes their nails.  I will be ordering more for Mothers Day or Christmas!!!</li>
    <li> This really helps me with applying my polish. I dont have to hold it in my hand lay it on something that will make it spill. I am enjoying this iteam. thank you</li>
    <li> Holds your polish steady. Love these.</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t worth the money.  I&#x27;ve tried to use Essie, OPI, China Glaze, Butter, Julep and even The smaller New Black bottles in these and they don&#x27;t work.  The ends bow up and the holder slides all over the place.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I loved it!!! Very useful product! It&#x27;s durable and made painting my nails much easier. Might just order more for gifts.</li>
    <li> While this product was in great condition I thought that I would be getting the two different polish holders but I got two of the same one.&lt;br /&gt;and it took forever for me to get them I forgot I had ordered them.</li>
    <li> The picture is misleading. It depicts a nail polish bottle leaning neatly to one side, with plenty of room to insert and remove the bottle. In reality, my OPI bottles don&#x27;t even fit. I have to fight with BOTH of these to get it in the holder, and even then it sits all wonky because the bottle has caused the base of this rubber holder to arch and it no longer sits flat. Dip your brush in and every time it feels like it&#x27;s going to tip over. Skip this purchase.</li>
    <li> These work great. Well worth the price. My daughter in law loves them&lt;br /&gt;Uses them a lot. Would recommend to buy.</li>
    <li> It took a very, very long time to receive this product and when it finally arrived it was &#x27;not exactly&#x27; as ordered.  It was supposed to be 1 round holder and 1 oval which would have been great since nail polish comes in differently shaped bottles(Unfortunately, I received 2 round ones instead.) I couldn&#x27;t find these holders in any stores so this worked for me.The people overseas who contacted me were very nice and try very hard to please the customer. Overall the product itself is good.  If you&#x27;re not in a hurry you will most likely be satisfied.</li>
    <li> They work really well.  I like the fact that I can put my nail color bottle in this holder and I don&#x27;t have to hold the bottle and try to keep my manicure from smudging.  The only problem that I have with this is not the product, but it took a long period of time to receive it after I ordered them.  The price is well worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> These are nothing special, but they do work. Took me months to find them and I believe it&#x27;s from a lack of desire to buy tiny plastic nail polish holders. thanks to the daughter they were found and purchased. The do the job, less change of tip overs and you can use all bottle size and shapes.</li>
    <li> the idea is good but the hole is too small to hold bigger nail polishes. the only nail polish that it holds is the small round sally nail polish sizes. it will not work for square like essie or big round one like finger paints and orly. the holder isn&#x27;t flexible so you can&#x27;t stretch or mold it to your own nail polish</li>
    <li> it gives u an extra hand when polishing your nails and it makes a big difference.  love it and highly recommend it</li>
    <li> My nieces are going to love theses xmas presents. I have boys so i kinda get to spoil my nieces with amazon fun stuff...thank god for little girls huh...amazon has been great for spoiling the girls</li>
    <li> These did not come in the two shapes listed - I got 4 identical holders (tho two pink and two white) that are all upright and with an opening only large enough for a very small bottle of nail polish. VERY DISAPPOINTED but were real cheap so, I should have known better</li>
    <li> Works for all diff. size bottles of polish &amp; the material its made of makes it easy to clean up any drips or spills. Great purchase at a great price :)</li>
    <li> Unless you use tall, skinny nail polish bottles - like Sally Hansen Hard As Nails - your bottles will pop out of these holders. The u-shaped cutouts are SUPPOSED to allow you to lean a bottle over to better access the polish inside, but the cutouts are too narrow to allow this and will pop the bottle back upright. Absolutely useless for Opi, Orly, Revlon, and like-sized bottles. Cannot recommend.</li>
    <li> worked as expecected. no issues holding different types of bottles. i like the product.</li>
    <li> these fit certain styles of nail polish bottles, my daughter uses them all the time. Helps with no spills</li>
    <li> Great product! Fit all of my main nail polish. Very much worth the money. It also came before the original date.</li>
    <li> Looking at the picture it&#x27;s not exactly what you get. You do get 2 and they&#x27;re tilted at an angle, not sitting upright which is nice!! The rubber is kind of hard, not soft so you do have to squeeze the rubber pretty good to get the polish in there. Once it is, it works nice and gets the job done! Easy, I don&#x27;t see myself spilling anymore! I recommend for the good price.</li>
    <li> Needs to be bigger to hold full size bottles like China glaze &amp; opi</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy I only paid $3 for 2 of these. It holds my nail polishes as I would have expected it too. It&#x27;s not a completely perfect fit but it does exactly what it was intended to do.... hold my nail polishes.</li>
    <li> Good idea, good product.  Also, clever to send two different styles so you can fit any of the hundreds of bottle variations.  So glad I won&#x27;t break any more bottles on the bathroom floor!</li>
    <li> Works just like you expect. The plastic is soft, but durable and they are easy to clean. What else can you say?</li>
    <li> It is so nice not to have to keep holding these every time to re-wet the brush!  Love them!  I recommend the seller and item very highly.</li>
    <li> product works as described, don&#x27;t really have any complaints so far, when an issue arrises I will put in another review</li>
    <li> Holds the finger polish while I paint my nails so that it doesn&#x27;t spill. I love it!!! I like having two different shapes also for different shaped nail polish bottles.</li>
    <li> I love these and need to order a few more as they are a huge help when doing your nail painting</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter who is 11 years old.  She has a problem using nail polish because the bottle moves on her or she cannot get the right amount of nail polish off the brush because of it being up and down.  This solves that problem!  It keeps your nail polish bottles still and offers you an angle so that you can polish your nails with ease!</li>
    <li> There is not too much to say about this product because it holds nail polish.  It works great.  I have some small bottles it holds those just fine too!</li>
    <li> These holders are very yseful. They help when i am doing my nails. It holds the bottle fine. might not work well if the bottle is skinny.</li>
    <li> When I first saw these I thought they were going to be great, but they are far from it. Not a single nail polish bottle I own (and I own over 100+) fit in the pink holder. The bottles do fit in the white holder but very awkwardly to the point you might as well not even use it. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money! The only reason I didn&#x27;t send them back is because they are located outside of the US and they were so cheap.</li>
    <li> I give these polish holders a 5 because they can hold any shape bottle of polish secure,the bottom my white holder came out but it didn&#x27;t affect the hold on the polish bottle,its made of thick rubber or plastic, I&#x27;m gonna buy another set.</li>
    <li> These are so great when doing one&#x27;s own nails!  I don&#x27;t have to worry about knocking my nail polish over especially when the cover is off.</li>
    <li> As it is. Everything is great!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these as nail polish holders. They are very sturdy and will not fall over whatsoever. I&#x27;ve been doing my own nails trying to save money and these makes it so much easier. Love my nail polish holders. Yay!!!</li>
    <li> The bottom falls off of the white one but other than that good.</li>
    <li> These arrived just in the nick of time to be stocking stuffers for my two girls.  The holders work well though I thought they would tilt the bottle a bit more.  We will continue to try them with different bottles of polish.  They do work very well at keeping the bottle steady.</li>
    <li> These are flexible and easy to travel with. They fit in my cosmetic box. They are convenient and help keep my nail polish from knocking over.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price on these little guys!</li>
    <li> work great and holds all shaped bottles</li>
    <li> This is super cute and convenient! This makes the perfect stocking stuffer for any girl who loves painting her nails!</li>
    <li> Great idea.works well to prevent nail polish spills.took longer than&lt;br /&gt;expected for delivery by regular mail.to large for smaller size nail polish containers</li>
    <li> super helpful when doing your own nails</li>
    <li> Sometimes I need the extra help of a polish holder.  These two pieces are just the trick to keep the bottle from moving around. You can also use these to tilt a partially full bottle to get the most out of it.</li>
    <li> They do the job! No more knocking over polish bottles! :)</li>
    <li> The bottoms of these fell off after just a few uses.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit any of my polishes</li>
    <li> These nail polish holders are wonderful.  They hold any and all of my polish bottles and keep them secure and tilted so I can use the very last of the polish.  AAAAA++++++++.  Fast ship and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE WONDERFUL. THE NAIL POLISH BOTTLE STAYS PUT!</li>
    <li> They have arrived, but as I am moving they were immediately packed without trying them out.</li>
    <li> Just got my package today and can&#x27;t wait to use it and see if it will make polishing my nails quicker! Like the fact that one is for thinner bottles and the other is for bulker bottles.</li>
    <li> Both holders were oval.</li>
    <li> I much prefer doing my own nails, so I much appreciate the  holders.  They allow me to get every last drop from the bottles.&lt;br /&gt;No spilling, no ruined nails from trying to tilt the bottle each time.</li>
    <li> The picture is not totally accurate.  I did receive the pink holder, but the white holder is not what the picture presents.</li>
    <li> Got these for my daughters and they were perfect stocking stuffers.  They love doing their nails and any little extra goodies I find for them to use are just a great bonus! They really like these.</li>
    <li> This item is amazing. I been looking for something like this to hold my polishes so I wouldn&#x27;t have to hold them in my hand.</li>
    <li> This does what it says, although it doesn&#x27;t have anything to anchor it to the table or whatever surface you&#x27;re using.  It does hold the nail polish but it can be knocked over easy.  I will still use this but very carefully.  :)</li>
    <li> These are amazing to use with the bottles that fit in these. It tilts them just perfectly to get your brush down into the polish. Some of the bigger bottles like OPI, ButterLONDON and Deborah Lippman were awkward in them and didn&#x27;t stay properly. Some of the bottles that did fit were China Glaze, Zoya, Essie, Sally Hansen, Orly and most of my indie polishes.</li>
    <li> Great products. They hold the bottles very still. Not all bottles fit.</li>
    <li> I do not use these polish holders much at all since purchasing them few months ago.  Very few of my polish bottles will fit in them for one thing; and those that do are not held securely enough for me.  I always fear they will tip over and spill.  I do have a few bottles that fit and for those the holders are okay.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my daughter.  She has not used them.  May give to my nail tech.</li>
    <li> I think that these holders will be a better choice for my nail polish bottles  They seem to hold the bottles tighter than the grip and tip holder.  :)</li>
    <li> I love these polish holders!  They are really useful and make painting your nails easier every time.  They are rubber feeling and hug any shape polish container.  They tip the bottle slightly so your brush can reach the polish when you have used it down some.  I keep my top coat and base coat in these at all times since I use them the most and then I rotate in my color choice as needed.  I recommend these holders and this seller to nail polish users!</li>
    <li> This has saved me from spilling.  Most bottles fit inside the holders.  I use them every week when I change my polish.</li>
    <li> I got these as a gift for my daughter.  She uses her artistic flair to draw designs on her nails and I wanted her to have a stand to hold her polish.  These are much smaller than I&#x27;d thought they&#x27;d be.  Out of over two dozen bottles of polish only 2 will fit into these.  I feel it was money poorly spent.</li>
    <li> Actually had one of these long time ago- it really held the bottles in place. Even when polishing in bed! I&#x27;ve got all kinds of polish and they do hold them all at a good angle-- I haven&#x27;t tried those \\&quot;smaller\\&quot; ones like sally hansen has come out with for like $2. so I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ll work for those but regular sizes do well. I DID wonder where they were coming from- got a \\&quot;shipped\\&quot; e-mail the day after ordering- but it took weeks to get them- almmost forgot I ordered them!</li>
    <li> now i canget to the bottom of the bottle...they arrived faster than stated..they seem to fit all the bottles that i have..great</li>
    <li> I would like to give a feet back but I haven&#x27;t got my 2 things how could I rate them?!!</li>
    <li> Great quality items for a good price - using them daily!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really hold polish well.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves it!</li>
    <li> The product is sturdy. I can polish now mess free.</li>
    <li> I like them very much.</li>
    <li> These are great! No more spills, love em!</li>
    <li> This is just what I needed especially when you have to tilt your bottle to get more polish on the brush. Great invention.</li>
    <li> My friend loves to do her nails so bought these as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;She said they worked great and helped with holding polish.</li>
    <li> I got these for my 7 year old who is learning to paint her own nails, so she doesn&#x27;t tip over the bottle. they work great. She can dip back and forth without worrying about the bottle falling over, since they give it a broader base.</li>
    <li> If you just need something to hold the bottle upright this will work for most bottles. But if you (like me) need something to hold the bottle at an angle to get the last of the polish this barely works. I&#x27;m going to get a &amp;#34;Tip &amp; grip holder&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> The bottom of the white 1  fell out as soon as I used it was disappointed</li>
    <li> I just love these nail polish holders, especially when I am doing my toes... ladies this simple litlle things can make our beauty routine so much enjoyable and easy for our back and neck too! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> A must! These have helped doing my bails so much. Keeps the bottle at a much getter angle.</li>
    <li> Great idea. I just jam the bigger nail polishes in and it seems to work. Works great for the price.</li>
    <li> these little things work to keep polish tilted at a great angle to keep just enough into the brush area without spills</li>
    <li> These are nice holders, but my teenage daughter does not use them as much as I thought she would. They are sitting on her vanity table for decoration only.</li>
    <li> Nail Polish Holders (Oval &amp; Round Style) (2 Pcs Total) The work just fine . They do hold all my different brans bottles well.</li>
    <li> Nail Polish Holders (Oval &amp; Round Style) (2 Pcs Total) THESE ARE GOOD, THEY HAD A GREAT PRICE AS WELL</li>
    <li> Really helps when I am trying to paint my nails with my non dominant hand. Can&#x27;t complain at all! I would def recommend.</li>
    <li> The price was good, this set was just as described and it&#x27;s a handy tool to have--makes the bottle stay where you want it and allows you to get the most out of contents when they get low.</li>
    <li> If I could put 0 I would! it&#x27;s way too small for these bottles here: so if you are using those on the list, forget about these holders, it won&#x27;t fit, it fits only the ART nails polish bottles, the ones that are tall and narrow, I had to throw mines out, don&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of sending back or refund, not worth the time and the money!</li>
    <li> Perfect! Exactly what I needed...some of my polish bottles fit a tight but its fine..better then it falling over while im polishing my nails.&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> These are great! They&#x27;d be even better if they had suction cups on the bottom.</li>
    <li> I love these things.  My polish use to slide around and sometimes tip over.  Now I can put my color polish and topcoat in them and not worry.  The only complaint I have is that the bottom piece of the white one kept falling off and won&#x27;t stay on now,  so I&#x27;ll have to tape it.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and it worked as advertised.</li>
    <li> Product does what its suppose to holds the polish bottle and keeps it from falling. Makes it easier to paint your own nails especially your toes.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit all bottles but I like the creativity. Helps out when you are multitasking or letting the nails dry;)</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to buy these based on previous reviews but am happy I did. First, they came earlier than expected. The 2 I received are the same size and shape; one white, one pink. So far, I have been able to use all the different sizes and shapes of nail polish bottles in these holders. My polish brands include Zoya, OPI, Sparitual, Essie, Julep, LAQA&amp;Co, Seche Vite, China Glaze, Deborah Lippman and more. The bigger sized bottles fit, just not all the way down (which isn&#x27;t necessary) and are easily put in at a tilted angle which I believe to be the manufacturers intention. As for the smaller circumferenced bottles like Julep, they of course do not get held tightly but with the bottle put in at an angle, the rubbery, &amp;#34;grippy&amp;#34; material of the holder keeps the bottle from moving around while applying polish. I give these polish holders two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> i love these and i cant belive i waited to get these nomore polish spilling!!! i have no proble fitting my polish in them some you have to push harder to fit but i love them!!!</li>
    <li> Bought as Christmas gift and she has already enjoyed the closeness that it has given her to her niece and to the fun that they and her friends have.</li>
    <li> I have always done my own nails  and I always thought, there must be an easier way, ta da, here it is, a little helper.</li>
    <li> I really like these. They hold square and other shapes as well.</li>
    <li> Very cheap. Barely holds bottle. More of a pain to use than not.</li>
    <li> It is made of a stiffer plastic which I like. I expected soft super flexible silicone and almost dreaded the thought of it popping out. I like mine. Also it&#x27;s two dif styles for pennies.</li>
    <li> The holders I received were exactly as the pictures showed and I got them in the time they said I would.</li>
    <li> Fits most round bottles, do not fit the square kind very well.</li>
    <li> These little holders are a godsend!  I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve tipped polish over. These work great with all of my polish bottles--OPI, Essie, square, round, whatever.  I kept one and gave the other to my niece, who is as pleased with them as I am.</li>
    <li> a must buy especially if your clumsy or you opperate very quickly around your work station. Just one less thing to worry about.</li>
    <li> The holders are to small for OPI, so I use it for my base and top coat which are smaller bottles but I have only have OPI so it doesn&#x27;t help much with that.</li>
    <li> These work fine on smaller round and oval bottles but not so well on larger ones such as SP.  Need a square one for some brands.  Great to have for DIY nail work.</li>
    <li> I love them. They hold my polish bottles very nice so I don&#x27;t have to worry about knocking them over while I&#x27;m working on my client.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Arrived b4 delivery date. Look a little small for my nail polish bottles which are a little bigger then the holes.</li>
    <li> So convenient while polishing your nails. Makes the job easier&#x27; without spills and messes. Love theses especially when my nail polish are running low, I does the tilting for me to get the product I need.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good to have it when you apply your own nail polish. I would recomend it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I went w/ this product b/c of the style (one oval &amp; one round. That&#x27;s not what I received. I received two rounds.</li>
    <li> Arrived early then expected my daughter loves it , I order two sets one to sent out as a gift and the other for her to use she said is very convinent she doesn&#x27;t have to hold the nail polish bottle in her hand anymore..</li>
    <li> Most of my nail polish bottles are square or circular so it doesn&#x27;t fit so well. I thought the bottom of the nail polish holder would have more grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying this wasn&#x27;t necessary.</li>
    <li> Love these no more spills</li>
    <li> these are awesome prevents spill and has a nice slant</li>
    <li> Got both oval ones but pink and white.</li>
    <li> I find these to be practical. The price was low.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that one of the bottoms came off however it is still totally usable.</li>
    <li> All nail polish bottles are so did. That these will not fit all😴</li>
    <li> These work BUT they hardly fit the China Glaze and OPI polish bottles. and guess what the majority of my polishes are! So if they would stretch to comfortably fit those i would have given it 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I was able to paint my nails in my bed and on carpet, so I am impressed! Too, these were super cheap!</li>
    <li> took 2-3 weeks to arrive. the holders i received were shaped different then the ones in the picture...mine work better with smaller bottles (julep, essie, etc) and larger bottles (OPI) wouldnt fit. One of the holders (the white one) was very rubbery and could fit many different sizes of bottles. the other (pink) was more of a hard plastic and cant hold my larger bottles. i will be giving it to a friend who uses lots of gel bottles (they are always on the smaller side). still worth the price if you are a nail junkie, i love adding new tools to my nail kit. and speeds up my mani time!!</li>
    <li> perfect ... wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect have never seen these before and think that they will come in handy</li>
    <li> These are awesome. I hate knocking my polishes over and loosing the liquids and making a mess. These prevent you from knocking them over, holds all sizes perfectly. Not intended for nail art polish. But is awesome for everything else. I need like a million of these, they work so good!</li>
    <li> Waste of space and not useful</li>
    <li> Simple and easy. If I could make one change it would be some kind of suction on the bottom to hold them better. But items were exactly as described and a great price. No complaints here.</li>
    <li> Kind of hard to get bottles to go into them</li>
    <li> only holds smaller bottles like the xtreme kind..</li>
    <li> Great ! Holds any size or shape of the bottle!</li>
    <li> I really like these but they only fit most bottle sizes. I have a few brands I have to fight with some to get them inside the holders. Just something to be aware of. The seller was a 5 star seller.</li>
    <li> daughter loves these!  great for nail polish enthusiasts.</li>
    <li> I love these! They work just as described. I use several bottles when I&#x27;m doing my nails. I will be buying more of these to hold all the bottles while I&#x27;m doing my nails.</li>
    <li> I love these things I use them every time I paint my nails which is about once a week. I like how they fit every type of bottle and keep the polish from spilling. A must have for anyone who paints their nails.</li>
    <li> I have the round, pink holder and it is very good. I can put all my different size bottles into it and it works great! Hold the polish so you don&#x27;t spill and you can &amp;#34;tip&amp;#34; most of the bottles about 1/4 way so you can get the polish lower in the bottle. I would definitely recommend this product to my friends and family!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product holds her nail polish while working on her nails</li>
    <li> needed it just the other day while doing my little girls nails since she will most likely knocked it down  will recommend</li>
    <li> This makes it easier to keep your polish from tipping over which I have had happen before. Less mess and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Just what I was needed.</li>
    <li> Only used it once so far, but it worked. It looks like it fits all of my various bottle sizes. I am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> These have made painting my nails SO much easier!! Love these.</li>
    <li> Great product! Keeps bottles from tipping over.they are inexpensive, and easy to use. Great for young and old to use.</li>
    <li> Omg! I love these! I&#x27;m a nail artist and these are soooooo helpful! I couldn&#x27;t be more happier! Thank you.</li>
    <li> They are superb little finger nail polish holders. Man, I don&#x27;t know what I ever did without them! Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really liking these polish holders.  I recommend purchasing both styles to make sure you have the right shape for any bottle.  They do a great job of keeping the polish from sliding around so that you don&#x27;t have to worry about knocking over the polish bottle or spilling.  Between the 2 shapes, all of my brands of polish have worked out.</li>
    <li> These hold my bottles of polish just right, without tipping over. I looked at some of the fancier nail holders, but worried that they would tip over and spill my polish.</li>
    <li> Cool product.  Got for a friend who loves nail polish.</li>
    <li> The white holder that i received does not hold. Everytime you place the polish in the holder that back falls out. All in all this was not helpful to me it was defective</li>
    <li> They are cheap but do what they say.  Although it says there are 2 holder types, both of the ones I received were like the pink one.  For the $2 I paid it isn&#x27;t worth the effort to get them exchanged.  The bottles are very tight in these holders.  I have to force the Seche Vite in the holder and the Gelous vials fit tightly also.  Forget using them with China Glaze...they don&#x27;t fit at all.  OPI vials fit nicely.  I have a bottle of Fuzzy Coat by Sally Hanson that fits well also.  So, 2 stars off because the item description does not match what I received and they are not a one size fits all.</li>
    <li> I ordered an oval and a round style. I got two round styles. Not about to send it back since it took so long to get them to start with. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Have you ever tried to dip your brush to get more polish, with only one hand?  I have and I spilled the bottles.  Not any more!!  Just set these on a flat surface-like your counter-insert the bottle, and Voila!  No more spills...</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered very useful. I change my nail color frequently and the nail polish holders come in handy.&lt;br /&gt;no more spilling my nail polish with these handy nail polish holders.&lt;br /&gt;I recommended to all my friends. even got my sister one.</li>
    <li> This product took a long time to get to me.  and then I was disappointed that NONE of my polish bottles would fit in it. I threw them away.</li>
    <li> I do nails from my house. My little cousin things she&#x27;s the worlds greatest help when it comes to doing nails and I&#x27;m always scared to death she&#x27;s going to hit the polish and knock it over. Got these for that very reason. Stands up on it&#x27;s own with even with carpet. VERY pleased with these products. I would like to buy more as gifts for my friends. They&#x27;re just so great!</li>
    <li> these are silicone or rubber not hard plastic,will fit most if not all nail polish bottles. i got for my 6 year old to help keep bottles off carpet. These are better than i expected!</li>
    <li> These work well and keep polish from spilling. The only problem is they don&#x27;t fit bottles like OPI. Which is what I love. They fit smaller bottles very nice.</li>
    <li> These are pretty great, although they&#x27;re a little on the tight side for certain brands &amp; bottle sizes. They&#x27;re flexible enough to make it work, though. The only hitch is that they don&#x27;t necessarily sit totally flat on a surface when holding a bottle (you can see in the photo that the base lifts a little), but the material is grippy enough to stay in place anyway. Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with these little guys!</li>
    <li> These are great.  Very useful for holding nail polish and angling it.  I am using the pink one right now.</li>
    <li> I gave this three stars because while both holders work, I find that the pink one doesn&#x27;t quite hold my OPI bottles tilted in a stable position.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it came with the white and pink one which is a plus you definitely get what u pay for I expected it to be plastic but it&#x27;s a soft material like Tupperware lids for the price I can&#x27;t complain</li>
    <li> i wish i had bought this along time ago, it comes in handy. i wish they came in different colors.</li>
    <li> I love the holders, it lkeeps me from having to hold then when I&#x27;m trying to do my nails. Plus another great feature is when the bottle gets low, the holder allows you to tilt the bottle, so you can get it all.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girls, they said that it didn&#x27;t hold the bottles too well, but they still used them and were happy</li>
    <li> The bottles of polish we have don&#x27;t fit. this product only fit standard polish bottles, and it does&#x27;t stretch. didn&#x27;t work out</li>
    <li> Was a tad bigger than expected but will definitely be happily used and abused!</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t big enough to hold any of my polishes except my mini bottles.</li>
    <li> This is so helpful to hold my polish while I&#x27;m putting it on. I should have bought more for presents for the girls. Don&#x27;t worry it will spill.</li>
    <li> To me, this product was a waste of my money. At first glance I thought I could put my polish bottles on a slant for easier use of polish that is more then halfway gone. I have some large bottles that didn&#x27;t fit properly. Overall, it just wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> They fell apart before I could use them.  I through them in the trash!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Inexpensive and works well. Beware - this doesn&#x27;t work well with ALL bottles. Wide or oddly shaped ones may not fit. But, overall it&#x27;s a great addition to my nail set.</li>
    <li> its good for price but only works well with round nail polishes. the rest dont fit. OPI def does not fit in this</li>
    <li> Perfect little polish holders.  Served their purpose well.</li>
    <li> Received my holders to day the colors are very clear and the pink is very perky and bright.  The base fits in the middle of my hand.  It is a soft rubber holder which bends to hold the polish bottles that are a little larger.  I think they will work out fine.  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I never saw this product before.  I always fumbled with the nail polish bottles especially when they&#x27;re half full.  With this, all you do is put any shape bottle in it and put it on a slant and it holds the bottle for you!  The bottom is rubber so it never moves.  I bought a set for myself and both my daughters and they love it to.  Can&#x27;t beat the price either.  Only negative is, it takes a long time to arrive.  Well worth the wait.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter uses thes all the time. She is not allowed to use polish in the house usless the bottle is set in one of these. My daughter loves these! They work really well. No spills. Very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Took to long to ship but it shipped from China. I like the concept though...it has saved my tables from my daughter doing her nails and the bottle not tipping over.</li>
    <li> I get the urge to paint my nails in the most awkward places, and due to this, my polish bottles are usually balanced quite precariously, or I nearly knock them over when reaching for them. These nail polish holders are absolutely awesome for preventing my spasmatic accidents. They hold most bottles steady, and thanks to the rubber-like base, they don&#x27;t slide all over the place. I received these as a gift, and absolutely love them.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used these yet but they are well made.  I would recommend this to everyone.  Would purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;wish they came in a bunch of different sizes</li>
    <li> Great price, product, and shipping arrival timing!</li>
    <li> Love love love love love love love love love love this it help you out when you sre doing you nail art designs it work  ppl so get you some i am going to by 9 more i use a lot of nail polish at the same time</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t give this 5 stars only because a great deal of my polish bottles are larger than these holders.</li>
    <li> I used the large and small holder with my nail polishes. Worked without tipping or moving around. Impressed that it worked.  Bought from amazon they never let me down!</li>
    <li> I thought these might not work for oval bottles of polish but you can actually use either one of these polish holders and they work, well.  I don&#x27;t know how I ever did without them.  The price is unbelievable for such a useful little gadget.  It&#x27;s like having 3 hands now!</li>
    <li> THESE WORK GREAT FOR HOLDING MY GEL NAIL POLISH AND GEL TOP COAT!!!  THE PRICE WAS FABULOUS AND THE SHIPPING WAS GROOVY ON THESE!!!  IF YOU DO YOUR OWN POLISH, THEN YOU REALLY NEED THESE HOLDERS!!!</li>
    <li> a little hard to get the bottle in, but overall a decent product</li>
    <li> Flexable  keeps from tipping over</li>
    <li> I really like these! I get lots of compliments about them in class, and they are very helpful!</li>
    <li> Works great. Have prevented many spills. One fits smaller bottles like Wet&#x27;n&#x27;Wild and the other fits larger like Opy. I recommend these to everyone. It works on almost all surfaces, and keeps them in place and from falling over. Great gift idea for bridal parties or as party favors. If you do your nails a lot you will want these.</li>
    <li> Worked. If you push the bottles in too far they might tip over. I liked them.</li>
    <li> Holds average bottle nicely.  Striper bottles, not so much.  I&#x27;ve stuck rather fat bottles in these with no worries as well as thinner ones. I ordered http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FBT6M0/ the same day as these and am glad I did, between them, every bottle I currently have can be held by one of the three. :-)  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love these.. I use them everytime i paint nails.. It keeps my nail polish in place...</li>
    <li> Great product, great price!</li>
    <li> Gave these as gifts love em</li>
    <li> Keeps my nail polish from falling on its side and spilling its contents. Quality of construction is very good with both styles.</li>
    <li> these holders do exactly whats its meant to do,now i can paint my nails and never worry of accidental spills or knocking it off hard surfaces.</li>
    <li> now I can get to the bottom of the bottle without ruining the other nails I just finished. it actually saves money if I can use all the product. great item and great seller. thanks</li>
    <li> Ok ok ok we&#x27;re do I start here this is a life saver I will not spill finger nail polish again hurray yes no more spills every nursing home rehabilitating home need these in there this will help out a lot.</li>
    <li> It works, but you get what you pay.</li>
    <li> These turned out to be different than what I thought they would be when I purchased them.  I ended up giving them to my sister-in-law to use.</li>
    <li> These are too small for today&#x27;s nail polish bottles. They do not fit. I threw them away</li>
    <li> This product works ok. I was very disappointed that it took so long to get it. It was part of a gift &amp; it was so late getting here that I had to give to the person later. I&#x27;m glad that this didn&#x27;t cost that much. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> With both of these holders. It will hold most of your bottles. I do hope they bring out one to hold the mini bottles we get from nail polish world. I am glad to have these and not worry about tipping bottles spilling my one of kind polishes I get.</li>
    <li> The oval piece doesn&#x27;t hold bigger bottle shapes, and some even slip out, which sucks because I&#x27;m partial to it. They both get the job done though. They&#x27;ve definitely made painting my nails with half empty bottles MUCH easier.</li>
    <li> I have spilled my share of nail polish!  I really like that you get these 2 different shaped holders, cause there are so many different shaped bottles of nail polish.</li>
    <li> Item works great. Holds various sized bottles well and holds them securely. Allows bottle to be held in a tipped position.</li>
    <li> Had been looking for some polish holders but these just refuse to hold any bottles, regardless of size that I have. The rubber is too stiff and the bottle just slowly start popping out of these.</li>
    <li> I love them! No spills, no nicks in the polished nail. It was much easier to use -- and saves every drop of polish.</li>
    <li> One for me and one for a friend.Already using mine and it really helps hold the polish bottle steady</li>
    <li> I thought that these nail holders were hard plastic, but they aren&#x27;t! To my surprise they are made of soft plastic that is pretty durable. Look better in person and came faster than I expected. Very pleased with the product!!! Will recommend to family and friends.</li>
    <li> I got these to help hold my nail polishes but the pink one doesn&#x27;t fit any of my polishes except the mini bottles which sucks because I don&#x27;t have many of them. I wish I could use both of them the way I want but you get what you pay for.</li>
