### Positive Reviews

<ol>

      <li>This 7 pack is a good deal.</li>
      <li>Teeth are good they chew stuff and lots of delish s</li>
      <li>Good price on the multi-pack.  </li>
      <li>This product is awesome; setting variety is great; look and feel great; I would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with the 7-pack ProResults brush heads.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a very pleased customer.</li>
      <li>I bet Philips is showing some amazing financials lately....hahaha</li>
      <li>The good news is that everyone in our family has gotten great dental checkups since switching to this system, so I suppose they&#x27;re worth it.</li>
      <li>very so you may want to shop around for the best price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I was thrilled to find this product offered for this price.</li>
      <li>This 7 brush purchase is the most cost effective way to buy Sonicare brush heads.  </li>
      <li>The Sonicare product is by far the best toothbrush system I have used.</li>
      <li>Purchasing from Amazon is always a good experience and the product was delivetd quickly.</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>and I change them every 6 months, they say every 3 months, but, unless the bristles are frayed, I only change every 6, and that is perfect!</li>
      <li>fit well on my sonicare toothbrush that i own.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps Phillips could lower the price in an attempt to lure more customers into the fold?</li>
      <li>Sure they are cheaper but don&#x27;t come close to the quality of Sonicare.</li>
      <li>But for the love of God Sonicare do you have to rip us off on the replacement brushes?</li>
      <li>So, you dont have to buy as many at a time and save $1.53 each head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, there are many superlative reviews, leading me to doubt the validity or objectiveness of the reviews.  </li>
      <li>I love this toothbrush and so does my hygenist....</li>
      <li>Give us a break for the love of God.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>This pack of 7 is cheaper and is a great deal, I now find myself replacing the brush head more often, not because it wears out sooner, but because I can put a new head on it after it wears out without guilt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I personally like the Phillips Sonicare, as it does a very good job at removing plaque from the teeth.</li>
      <li>Yes Sonicare has cornered the market on a toothbrush system that really works and dentists highly recommend this Sonicare System for the best dental and preventative care out there.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t fit into the very back of my mouth (I recommend switching to the Compact Brush Heads for that), but otherwise they provide the best clean I have ever had.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the best price I&#x27;ve found, even considering the use of coupons with other vendors.</li>
      <li>Shipment was very quick.</li>
      <li>So remember: use a light touch putting them on and taking them off.</li>
      <li>these fit my Sonicare</li>
      <li>best part is this is one of the few sellers who carries a 7-pack of these replacement heads.</li>
      <li>I should have taken the time to read the seller reviews for &amp;#34;goodidea0113&amp;#34;, as many noted not being aware of where the products were coming from.  </li>
      <li>After brushing my teeth feel delightfully clean.</li>
      <li>The brushes them selves really clean teeth</li>
      <li>Honestly, made in China and more than likely costs about 2 cents a brush to make.</li>
      <li>i would recommend this toothbrush to anyone, keeps teeth clean.</li>
      <li>Hmmmmm.....  OK, so I love my Sonicare toothbrush (I started using Sonicare in the mid &#x27;90&#x27;s!)  </li>
      <li>This would allow customers to make more informed decisions as to whether to buy from a particular seller or not.</li>
      <li>This would allow customers to make more informed decisions as to whether to buy from a particular seller or not.roduct way beyond the supposed due-date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have purchased this in the 3 pack before, am glad to find a larger package to save more money on.......</li>
      <li>The first couple of times we were able to pop the top part of the head back onto the bottom part.</li>
      <li>I would seriously recommend this product to any one who&#x27;s interested in obtaining and maintaining excellent oral care for themselves and family..</li>
      <li>The seller I delt with delivered my order earlier than expected,which was a nice surprise.</li>
      <li>order was received quickly and was exactly as specified.  </li>
      <li>I paid the same price for a 5-pack of brush heads from somewhere else last year, so I was happy to spend the same amount for 2 more brush</li>
      <li>Undoubtedly, Philips&#x27; business plan for this is to make more money on replacement heads than the initial product&#x27;s sale price.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;In closing, Amazon PLEASE do a better job of identifying the location of your international sellers.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;In closing, Amazon PLEASE do a better job of identifying the location of your international sellers.  </li>
      <li>The Sonicare ProResult Heads work very well.</li>
      <li>What is there to really say about a toothbrush?</li>
      <li>Came fast too.  </li>
      <li>confirmed the following day (27 March).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;However, my 1-star review is for the fact that the particular seller that supplied these - a seller named &amp;#34;goodidea0113&amp;#34; - was unknowingly located in South Korea.  </li>
      <li>The problem I have with this product is the price, which seems rather high for replacement heads.</li>
      <li>Replacing these gets expensive, but I keep paying because they really do give me a superior cleaning.</li>
      <li>This 7-pack is a very economical purchase compared to buying these in the smaller packs at our local retailers.</li>
      <li>Considering the relative simplicity of the product, this seems more like a revenue-generating stream by Philips and a cash grab, but I guess you don&#x27;t have any other choices if you want to keep using the power brush.  </li>
      <li>While it cannot be proven, too many superlative reviews, often written with similar phraseology, are a red flag that the seller is &amp;#34;stacking the deck&amp;#34; in their favor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest Amazon adopt what eBay does - please note the seller&#x27;s location next to their name, especially if it is an international seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>hard to find a bigger package like this that contains more than 3, this was one of the only ones, thanks!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure any of these electrics are necessarily better than another, given a similar price range.</li>
      <li>I could understand if this part was sourced internationally, but it clearly states on the box that the product is &amp;#34;Made in USA&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>you really must handle them carefully when removing them from the brushing handle device or the head will break.</li>
      <li>The only problem that I can see is that the tells tend to show excessive ware for change almost iImmediately after use beginning, but other than that we are very comfortable with these</li>
      <li>/&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s a cultural thing, but &amp;#34;goodidea0113&amp;#34; also included a brown rice tea bag as a &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34;,  Personally, I find this a bit off-putting, seeing how it is essentially a food product that has been shipped to the US without any inspection.  </li>

<li> The little blue strip turns white when it needs to be replaced which I&#x27;ve noticed</li>
<li> Tried other brands including generic brands but not was a mistake.</li>
<li> The first failed from a non-charging battery that is not replaceable.</li>
<li> But each head breaks down to close to $8 a head, or about $2.66 a month.</li>
<li> So it is a bit odd</li>
<li> Each brush head was less than $8 a head.</li>
<li> When I purchased this pack of 7 it seemed to be a little cheaper</li>
<li> I brush three times a day for a few minutes each time.</li>
<li> I purchased the multipack and they are the same as the ones you buy at the drugstore, but much less expensive.</li>
<li> The second failed from a small plastic piece that broke inside the head that the brush fits onto.</li>
<li> This has happened at least three times to my wife.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;m not sure any of these electrics are necessarily better than another, given a similar price range. What is there to really say about a toothbrush? I&#x27;ve not had any problems with these.</li>
    <li> What a difference using Philips Sonicare ProResults has made in my dental health. This 7 pack is a good deal.</li>
    <li> Hmmmmm.....  OK, so I love my Sonicare toothbrush (I started using Sonicare in the mid &#x27;90&#x27;s!)  The replacement heads are just that - replacement heads.  If you like sonicare, you like the replacement heads.  The question here is the price - this product offering is 7 heads for 64.35, or $9.19/head.  Meanwhile, Amazon sells a 3-head pack for $23, or $7.66/head.  So, you dont have to buy as many at a time and save $1.53 each head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this vendor needs to rethink their pricing (or perpahs they dont actually want to sell this product?)</li>
    <li> I have purchased this in the 3 pack before, am glad to find a larger package to save more money on.......these fit my Sonicare and I change them every 6 months, they say every 3 months, but, unless the bristles are frayed, I only change every 6, and that is perfect!</li>
    <li> Yes Sonicare has cornered the market on a toothbrush system that really works and dentists highly recommend this Sonicare System for the best dental and preventative care out there. But for the love of God Sonicare do you have to rip us off on the replacement brushes? Honestly, made in China and more than likely costs about 2 cents a brush to make. Give us a break for the love of God. You should be wearing masks when you sell these to the public if you get my meaning here.</li>
    <li> these brush heads are for the sonicare proresults toothbrush.  i found the 7 heads to be the best value around.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very good at cleaning teeth. They don&#x27;t fit into the very back of my mouth (I recommend switching to the Compact Brush Heads for that), but otherwise they provide the best clean I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is a problem: each brush head lasts me about a week. I brush three times a day for a few minutes each time. Replacing these gets expensive, but I keep paying because they really do give me a superior cleaning.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the 7-pack ProResults brush heads. Shipment was very quick. This 7-pack is a very economical purchase compared to buying these in the smaller packs at our local retailers. I would buy this product from Amazon again.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My husband &amp; I each have have a Phillips Sonicare Toothbrush. Item was recommended by our Dental Hygenist &amp; Tech.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this pack of 7 it seemed to be a little cheaper then it currently is. They price looks to very so you may want to shop around for the best price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is this is one of the few sellers who carries a 7-pack of these replacement heads.</li>
    <li> Good price on the multi-pack.  I paid the same price for a 5-pack of brush heads from somewhere else last year, so I was happy to spend the same amount for 2 more brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;My order was received quickly and was exactly as specified.  I will return to this seller in the future.</li>
    <li> Been finding buying these on Amazon is cost-effective compared to other means, and with the subscription you don&#x27;t even have to keep tabs on how old your current toothbrush head is, which is an added benefit.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare product is by far the best toothbrush system I have used. The brushes them selves really clean teeth well and the indicator seems to work too. However, Philips could spend a little more time on quality control because the last two Sonicare Systems I owned fail prematurely. The first failed from a non-charging battery that is not replaceable. The second failed from a small plastic piece that broke inside the head that the brush fits onto. Both of the failures happened outside the warranty period. I would think they should last 2-3 years for the price we pay for them.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I used to brush my teeth with a regular toothbrush. This product is awesome; setting variety is great; look and feel great; I would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product. Came fast too.  Quality is the same as the more expensive store bought ones. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> fit well on my sonicare toothbrush that i own.  hard to find a bigger package like this that contains more than 3, this was one of the only ones, thanks!</li>
    <li> Tried other brands including generic brands but not was a mistake. Sure they are cheaper but don&#x27;t come close to the quality of Sonicare.</li>
    <li> These are not an inexpensive investment in oral health so I was thrilled to find this product offered for this price. Each brush head was less than $8 a head. This is the best price I&#x27;ve found, even considering the use of coupons with other vendors. I&#x27;m a very pleased customer.</li>
    <li> These work perfectly with my pro-white sonic care toothbrush, these are oringal equipment replacements. Great value with this size pack.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare ProResult Heads work very well. After brushing my teeth feel delightfully clean. I would reccommend theses heads to a friend. I would also reccommend ordering from Amazon if you can&#x27;t get it at Costco on sale. The seller I delt with delivered my order earlier than expected,which was a nice surprise. My order was packed well,new as stated. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I purchased the multipack and they are the same as the ones you buy at the drugstore, but much less expensive.</li>
    <li> I used to buy refills at costco or bed bath and beyond where they sold them in packs of 3 or 5.  This pack of 7 is cheaper and is a great deal, I now find myself replacing the brush head more often, not because it wears out sooner, but because I can put a new head on it after it wears out without guilt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These worked identically to the ones I bought in the store.</li>
    <li> As many of the reviewers here, I must also note that these Philips SoniCare replacement brush heads are unnecessarily expensive - roughly $10 for each head.  Considering the relative simplicity of the product, this seems more like a revenue-generating stream by Philips and a cash grab, but I guess you don&#x27;t have any other choices if you want to keep using the power brush.  Undoubtedly, Philips&#x27; business plan for this is to make more money on replacement heads than the initial product&#x27;s sale price.  The Philips brush heads get 2 stars for being overly expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my 1-star review is for the fact that the particular seller that supplied these - a seller named &amp;#34;goodidea0113&amp;#34; - was unknowingly located in South Korea.

The order was placed on 26 March 2014 with shipping confirmed the following day (27 March).  But it took 3 weeks (21 days) to receive the order, even though the Amazon ad showed it was &amp;#34;in stock&amp;#34; and had a standard delivery of 5 to 8 business days.  Obviously, international shipping and customs clearance delayed this product way beyond the supposed due-date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s a cultural thing, but &amp;#34;goodidea0113&amp;#34; also included a brown rice tea bag as a &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34;,  Personally, I find this a bit off-putting, seeing how it is essentially a food product that has been shipped to the US without any inspection.

    <li> Teeth are good they chew stuff and lots of delish s***. Don&#x27;t lose your teeth to meth brush them s***s</li>
    <li> This 7 brush purchase is the most cost effective way to buy Sonicare brush heads.  Purchasing from Amazon is always a good experience and the product was delivetd quickly.</li>
    <li> I love my sonic are toothbrush but these brush heads are soooo expensive. They prob make them for 50 cents in china and they are banging them out for mega profit. I bet Philips is showing some amazing financials lately....hahaha</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush and so does my hygenist.... if you dont have one get one I use it daily</li>
    <li> I personally like the Phillips Sonicare, as it does a very good job at removing plaque from the teeth. The problem I have with this product is the price, which seems rather high for replacement heads. Perhaps Phillips could lower the price in an attempt to lure more customers into the fold?</li>
    <li> will be re-ordering this type again.  works well</li>
    <li> i have ordered this product before, its great.  i would recommend this toothbrush to anyone, keeps teeth clean. love it.</li>
    <li> For someone who uses Sonicare ProResult products, this price for 7 heads is a steal.  The little blue strip turns white when it needs to be replaced which I&#x27;ve noticed is every 2/4 months.</li>
    <li> The only problem that I can see is that the tells tend to show excessive ware for change almost iImmediately after use beginning, but other than that we are very comfortable with these</li>
    <li> I would seriously recommend this product to any one who&#x27;s interested in obtaining and maintaining excellent oral care for themselves and family..</li>
    <li> The good news is that everyone in our family has gotten great dental checkups since switching to this system, so I suppose they&#x27;re worth it. But each head breaks down to close to $8 a head, or about $2.66 a month. That&#x27;s highway robbery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND you really must handle them carefully when removing them from the brushing handle device or the head will break. This has happened at least three times to my wife. The first couple of times we were able to pop the top part of the head back onto the bottom part. The third time we weren&#x27;t, and lost $8. Man. So remember: use a light touch putting them on and taking them off.</li>
