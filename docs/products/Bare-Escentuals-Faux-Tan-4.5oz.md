      <li>Pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>It does have a pleasant smell and no self tanner stink.</li>
      <li>- This product has an unexpectedly pleasant almond smell, and I haven&#x27;t noticed the tell tell \\&quot;self-tanner fragrance\\&quot; while using it.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use (I did wear rubber loves when applying), no smell, and best of all, the \\&quot;tan\\</li>
      <li>Loved the way the tan looked but could not tolerate the smell.....</li>
      <li>I am fair and one coat is all I needed for a week</li>
      <li>My experience has been a good one..</li>
      <li>color isn&#x27;t that superior when compared to something like Jergens.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is good when you put it</li>
      <li>Surely there exists a happy medium.</li>
      <li>Good product providing a nice \\&quot;normal\\&quot; looking tan.</li>
      <li>If you re-apply twice a week, your skin will look healthy and sun-kissed all the time, without the UV rays and skin damage!</li>
      <li>This has been the most amazing self tan product ever, and I have tried them all!  </li>
      <li>One of the best things is that you see EXACTLY where this product is going on your skin.  </li>
      <li>Love the color!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had better luck with cheaper self-tanners and I&#x27;m going to continue using them!</li>
      <li>this stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>But, like i said it does give great color which is a huge plus</li>
      <li>It was a nice tan on me too.</li>
      <li>I have been using self tanning lotions for quite a few years now and this is the best of the best!</li>
      <li>It was kind of streaky in some areas.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It gives my skin a warm sun kissed glow even on my face.</li>
      <li>Judging from my hands and how many times I had to wash them to get the brown off, makes me think this self tanner is simply a really good stain.</li>
      <li>For those of you who choose to shave your legs and not wax, a nice touch up after shaving is to mix some Faux Tan with lotion and apply it on your lower legs.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a nice bronzed tan.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use, does transfer to your clothes, but washes out.</li>
      <li>I had a great application the very first time.</li>
      <li>This is the best self tanner that I have found so far.  </li>
      <li>This is, BY FAR, the best sunless tanner there is out there.</li>
      <li>I love love love this product!</li>
      <li>and you know with Bare Escentuals you&#x27;re getting the best thing for your skin.</li>
      <li>Again, get a brush it made a huge difference!</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this formula.  </li>
      <li>This is an OK self tanner.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It took me a couple of times to figure out how much to use, etc., but it works great.</li>
      <li>I can not be in the sun or use suntan beds so this is the next best thing.</li>
      <li>so I make sure I don&#x27;t go out when I use it.</li>
      <li>Absolutely in love already, just used it this morning and love every thing about it.</li>
      <li>I think wearing latex gloves would be better though.</li>
      <li>I think there are better options.</li>
      <li>You start to see color in about a 1/2 hr, and fully develops with more time.</li>
      <li>I am Hispanic but it looks better than a tan I would get from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Overall good product in my opinion!!</li>
      <li>Love the scent (smells like Almond Extract).</li>
      <li>Ive used them all and this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite self tanner.</li>
      <li>In my opinion, the scent is lovely - sort of almond like.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this is just an OK self tanner.</li>
      <li>I like this product for the most part.</li>
      <li>Have used it for years and have turned it on to many friends.  </li>
      <li>You will darken over night so dont apply more than one coat at a time.</li>
      <li>If that is the case just make sure to put lotion on your hands before applying the Faux Tan</li>
      <li>the tanner on evenly, don&#x27;t do too many layers because it will start to get sticky and then can get uneven/hard to apply</li>
      <li>I use this all the time and have used it for many years.</li>
      <li>One person wrote to purchase the blending brush to assure a more even coat.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d think it would work better for the price.</li>
      <li>You will LOVE it :)</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>This product is so much more and holds to its word \\&quot;better than real\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I;ve used better self tanner than this one.</li>
      <li>Love the product.</li>
      <li>Perhaps better than erring on the side of being an Oompa-Loompa?  </li>
      <li>They were OK, but orangy and smelled.  </li>
      <li>Still, quick nice color.</li>
      <li>I am very fair and never tan, especially on my legs.  </li>
      <li>3x&#x27;s more and felt totally comfortable wearing my dress w/o hose.  </li>
      <li>No streaks, NO ORANGE -&amp;#62; the most important thing to me.  </li>
      <li>never orange!I bought the brush also for easy application</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Well, I was a skeptic, but I am so easily swayed by positive reviews!I read so many great reviews on this tanning cream that I was &#x27;sold&#x27;! My experience has been a good one..I didn&#x27;t like the color coming out of the bottle but I guess it does help see what&#x27;s rubbed all the way in and whats not. I didn&#x27;t mind the smell, and more importantly, I couldn&#x27;t smell the smell on me for hours afterwards like most other tanning creams. In fact, I really didn&#x27;t smell it at all except for during the process of putting it on! That&#x27;s a plus for me. It was a nice tan on me too. I&#x27;m pretty pale and I usually get organgey no matter what. I&#x27;d say I still have a little splotchyness on my feet, even though it all looked rubbed in, and it looks a tiny bit orange on my feet but might just appear organgey because it didn&#x27;t rub in evenly over my feet. I&#x27;m happy with it! It isn&#x27;t a very big bottle and it wasn&#x27;t cheap, in my opinion, for the amount that you get, but if it does the job right (which I feel it did) then I&#x27;ll pay the price! A tan ALWAYS looks better than being pale! Overall good product in my opinion!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried a lot of self-tanning, tanning lotions, but this is a great product. The color will wash off your hands fairly easily after application. You&#x27;ll see enhanced color in your skin within hours, and it will last a few days. If you re-apply twice a week, your skin will look healthy and sun-kissed all the time, without the UV rays and skin damage! (I usually apply, give it 20-30 minutes, then put clothes on and go about my day -- trying not to shower for 4-6 hours for max color development.)</li>
    <li> This is a great self tanner.  First off it does not smell like most of those on the market, this has a light fragrance similar to Jergens Cherry Almond in my opinion.  I am fair and one coat is all I needed for a week, it&#x27;s a nice bronzed tan.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product after reading some of the reviews. One person wrote to purchase the blending brush to assure a more even coat. After trying the product I was not only orange for the first day but also had streaks. I almost felt as though I went back about thirty years when the only thing available was QT. After taking a shower, the color did subside to a more normal tanning color and did last about five days. I will not purchase any additional bottles of this for the price. I will stick with my Jergen&#x27;s tanning lotion that gradually colors your skin for a about half the cost.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t a self-tanner I haven&#x27;t tried. I started using Faux Tan about three years ago and it&#x27;s become part of my regular beauty routine.  I try to protect my skin as much as possible, but I love being tan. This is the most natural product I&#x27;ve found. There is a \\&quot;body brush\\&quot; available on QVC...make the investment as it makes application a breeze even for the face. You won&#x27;t be disapointed with this purchase. There is a very slight smell to it...the typical smell, but much less than any other product.  The tan lasts for at least 4 days as long as you don&#x27;t exfoliate. Again, get a brush it made a huge difference!</li>
    <li> Bought this because I had to wear a dress to a wedding and didn&#x27;t want to wear pantyhose.  First time I put it on saw beautiful color on my pale legs.  3x&#x27;s more and felt totally comfortable wearing my dress w/o hose.  Have to apply quickly and get it off your palms or they too will have a beautiful tanned glow!</li>
    <li> LADIES this stuff is amazing. The first time I bought it was in Vegas at a super upscale salon that charged 3X what Amazon.com is charging. I used it till I scrapped the bottle out! This stuff has no nasty smell, it leaves you with a dark natural tan. I am forever a customer of Faux Tan and recommend it to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> Bare Escentuals Faux Tan  tan goes on evenly and bronzes you immediately.  I use it on my arms and legs.  Just wash your hands right after applying or use the brush in a circular motion.  The small size is great for travel.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product! I had a great application the very first time. Everyone was amazed that I obtained such a natural tan so fast. I am very pale and this gives me that end-of-summer glow everyday. I re-apply once a week and there is so strong odor that lingers like some other products I have tried in the past.   Everyone should try this... you will never use another product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely in love already, just used it this morning and love every thing about it. Real deep looking tan, easy to apply I just took one section of my body at a time so that I could work it in before it started to dry, since it does dry fast and I used very little product, much less than you are probably used to with other products which is what I think explains some of the more negitive reviews. Not rubbing off on my white pants, which is fantastic. Blended perfectly, since you can see it as you apply it. Gave me an instant tanned look. It does leave your hands hard to clean, however I had read a previous review somewhere saying to use whitening toothpaste to clean your hands when you are finished, and IT WORKED like a charm!! 5 stars, A+, I will be canceling my membership at the tanning salon.</li>
    <li> I have very fair, freckled skin that never had any business being in the sun, but I abused myself for years laying in the sun trying to get tan.  I finally stopped such foolishness, and turned to self tanners.  They were OK, but orangy and smelled.  Two years ago, a friend turned me on to Bare Escentuals Faux Tan.  OMG!!!  This has been the most amazing self tan product ever, and I have tried them all!  (I do recommend gloves with the application.)  I always exfoliate, shave, etc before application.  The product might seem odd coming out of the bottle, with its dark, muddy green color.  Rest assured, you will not turn green.  In my opinion, the scent is lovely - sort of almond like.  I apply it in circular motions all over.  Afterward, I use a damp cotton ball to dab my knees, elbows, etc. so that these naturally rougher areas of the body don&#x27;t absorb more color and appear too dark.  Faux Tan will give you some instant color upon application, but continues to darken over the next few hours.  I apply it at night, then I go to bed (I often lay an old sheet on top of my nice sheets on the nights I jump into bed with a fresh application of Faux Tan on.)  Then in the morning - voila!!  Tanned!  Bare Escentuals Faux Tan is so natural looking, doesn&#x27;t smell, gives you rich lovely color, and makes you feel good all over!!  For those of you who choose to shave your legs and not wax, a nice touch up after shaving is to mix some Faux Tan with lotion and apply it on your lower legs.  If you desire a darker tan, just apply it 2  - 3 nights in a row.  If you are new to self tanning products, the application process may sound like a lot of work.  Once you get the hang of it, it isn&#x27;t.  I can get it applied and dab the excess off my knees and elbows in 3 - 5 minutes max.  Happy Tanning!</li>
    <li> Formula degraded after a few months.  I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between using it and not when I put it on one leg.  I think there are better options.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and it does give a nice tan but not any better than the stuff I usually get at the local drug-store for half the price. I do like the smell and the result but I probably won&#x27;t order this product again.</li>
    <li> This is, BY FAR, the best sunless tanner there is out there. When I tell you I have tried EVERYTHING, I am not kidding. I am probably the palest person in the entire world. The lightest shade they sell of makeup is usually too dark for my skin. Therefore, I do not tan and am constantly looking for a solution. I always stuck with the typical Jergens or Neutrogena, never completely satisfied, but when my mom introduced me to this, I refused to use anything else. It is completely streak free because its already brown when you are putting it on. It instantly makes you darker and the darkness increases over about 12 hours I would say. It barely smells in comparison to most. It makes you golden brown, not orange in the slightest. When you are putting it on, you can see it almost has a greenish tint to it, which makes complete sense because green is the opposite of orange (you don&#x27;t turn green from it, I promise, I&#x27;m assuming this has to do with making it non-orange). It is very expensive, however, it is absolutely worth the price if you ask me. The only thing I suggest is that you buy some sort of pumice stone so that you can get it off of your hands after putting it on because it makes them VERY dark, and its not that easy to get off. I&#x27;ve found a pumice stone is perfect for removing it from my palms. Anyway, everyone thinks it&#x27;s a natural tan, and that&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;m always looking for. I refuse to look orange and streaky. Faux Tan really is better than a real one. Buy this, you will not be disappointed, I promise!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see think this products works as well as everyone says. It says the color should last 3 days and I don&#x27;t think it last more than one day.</li>
    <li> I was hopeful about this self tanner. Great reviews and the fact that it didn&#x27;t have an overpowering self tanner smell or overly fragranced to mask the self tanner smell. But I found it unimpressive. It does have a pleasant smell and no self tanner stink. But that makes me wonder if the ingredient that makes your skin tan is not very plentiful in this tanner. That&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t have that strong self tanner smell. Because I don&#x27;t think my skin actually \\&quot;tanned\\&quot;. I think it only stained my skin. Judging from my hands and how many times I had to wash them to get the brown off, makes me think this self tanner is simply a really good stain. I only applied it every other day and found that by the next application the color was fading and not fading evenly. I didn&#x27;t think I looked horribly blotchy, but I could see areas on my legs that definitely looked more faded than others. The day of application, I looked pretty evenly tanned and not orange or fake. But by the second day, uneven fading and sort of orangey. I think I&#x27;ve gotten better results with Loreal&#x27;s Deep Bronzer. Just wish the tanners that work didn&#x27;t stink or didn&#x27;t have some horrible fragrance. This would have been good if it only produced better results.</li>
    <li> OK, so I have used soon many different types of self tanners and this one blows so many out of the water. I strictly use this on my face. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores,it shows up instantly &amp; just looks like a natural glow on your face. Although you can use it on your whole body,I personally use sprays on my body and keep this gem for my face&amp; neck,plus that way it lasts away longer. Loooves it!! By the way. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5yrs &amp; was super exited to see it on amazon because obviously alot cheaper than in the stores.And to boot, this company has it shipped to me asap,like that too!</li>
    <li> After reading awesome reviews about this product, I decided to order it as I have tried many self-tanners over the years.  However, I was really disappointed with this self-tanner.  I felt that I only had color for a day or two and it faded quickly.  I also like to use lotions that have a bit of a bronzer in them but that didn&#x27;t even help.  It also didn&#x27;t stick very well to my hands and feet.  I&#x27;ve had better luck with cheaper self-tanners and I&#x27;m going to continue using them!</li>
    <li> This is a WONDERFUL product!  Easy to use (I did wear rubber loves when applying), no smell, and best of all, the \\&quot;tan\\&quot; it gives you looks so real.  No one will know, unless you tell them.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunless tanner I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve tried St. Tropez, Fake Bake, Clinique etc. and they&#x27;ve never given me any color. I tried the Bare Escentuals Faux Tan, and it&#x27;s non greasy, dries quickly and has a pleasant smell. I woke up to a beautiful, natural golden color. Twenty two dollars may seem a bit pricey, but it&#x27;s well worth it. I spent almost fifty dollars on St. Tropez and had to practically use the whole bottle in a week to see any color change. Faux tan is definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great tanner. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> The other great reviews prompted me to try this self tanner... and I&#x27;m totally happy I did!  First off, it&#x27;s actually NATURAL looking.  Even on my fair skin I actually look instantly bronzed rather than like I have somehow morphed into a oompa-loompa&#x27;s cousin.  I also despise the funky odor associated with most self-tanners...and this one has a light natural fragrance that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  My skin is pretty sensitive and break-out prone, so I was happy to find that my temperamental skin had no issues with faux tan.  Finally, I LOVE that you get an instant tan from this product and can actually see where you will develop a tan before it happens... makes it kind of goof proof.  You definitely have to wash your hands well after applying... lots of soap and water to avoid the dead give-away brown finger effect (yuck, not a good look).</li>
    <li> Best tanner at home product out there you will not be let down must have for the winter months when u want some color</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion works great! Love the scent (smells like Almond Extract). Does not dry out my skin and leaves a very natural color. The only downside is you have to scrub your hands to get the lotion off after applying.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve used as a cream, but when I put it on it&#x27;ll turn my skin brown so I make sure I don&#x27;t go out when I use it. It lasts about 2 days until you have to reapply it. I&#x27;d think it would work better for the price.</li>
    <li> So, im very pale and so i dont like to go tanning because im scared of skin cancer and all that, its hard to find a self tanner that doesnt make me look orange or streaky! This tanner does a great job at giving me great color, the only problem id say is that within 2 days it seems to look quite a bit lighter (almost back to my orignal pale state) so i have to use it every 2 days if i want to keep that golden tan, unlike the product says it will last 5 days, it doesnt. But, like i said it does give great color which is a huge plus, i just wish i didnt have to apply it so often. I give this 4 out of 5 stars, if it stayed on a day or 2 longer i&#x27;d give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also i should mention, it tans pretty quickly so its important to rub it in right away or else you will get blotches, but i suppose thats pretty common. I mean, no longer then 10 seconds befor rubbing it in!</li>
    <li> This is an OK self tanner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;The smell is good when you put it on.&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t that noticeable after I took my first shower.&lt;br /&gt;It has a color guard.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;When I put it on, it looked even. But It wasn&#x27;t the same after it set. It was kind of streaky in some areas.&lt;br /&gt;The color isn&#x27;t that superior when compared to something like Jergens. I feel like I could use another, cheaper self tanner and get the same color.&lt;br /&gt;Takes a while to put on, especially with the brush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is just an OK self tanner. I am going to wait for it to fade and try a different one. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Faux self tanner is as good as it gets! I have always loveed Jergens Natural Glow Foam, But Faux takes it up a notch. I am a Bodybuilder for 25 years or more and if spray-tanning is too expensive- which it is, this this is the way to go. It dry&#x27;s jet fast so were gloves or do the brush. You can dress in 10 minutes but wait at least 3 0r 4 hours to shower and maybe swim the next day. One thing not covered by anyone is if you appily Faux before bedtime ( As I Do ) I go too the Gym in the Morning before work and when you sweat the BRONSER WILL DESTROY YOUR CLOTHING; The BRONSER or COLOR MARKER will naturaly come OFF. SHOWER IN THE MORNING, the dark color goinging into drains is the color Marker not your TAN ! A fter the shower you will have a wonderfull Natural Tan ! P.S If you have a very romantic night with your love one after you appiled Faux at night you will sweat Faux Tanner off.</li>
    <li> I like this product for the most part. I like self tanners that actually show up - the subtle ones that develop \\&quot;over time\\&quot; don&#x27;t do it for me. This one definitely gives you a good tan and I use it when I can&#x27;t get a professional spray tan. You just have to be careful applying. A couple tips I have found work well (from reading reviews and doing it myself):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Exfoliate beforehand with exfoliating gloves in the shower&lt;br /&gt;-Coat hands with normal lotion BEFORE pouring the tanning lotion into your hand (my hands tend to get VERY streaky and this lotion is DARK brown, so this is a must)&lt;br /&gt;-Rub the tanner on evenly, don&#x27;t do too many layers because it will start to get sticky and then can get uneven/hard to apply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wait to shower until the next day, and you will definitely see some come off in the shower, but then it looks pretty good. If you have white sheets, try to wear loose, dark soft pants to bed because it can definitely get on your sheets before you shower it off. Also, it may get on light colored towels, but will come off in the wash.</li>
    <li> This is the best Self Tanner on the market. I have tired probably 20 different ones over the years and nothing works as easily or as well.. A hint... I mix mine with a little Jergens lotion, it goes on smoothly and you use a little less so the bottle lasts longer. I just mix the two together in my hand and keep my hands washed immediately, no stain on hands at all. Yes, I do it quickly.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I wanted to stop using the tanning bed for obvious reasons but I like to go bare-legged. I tried a few of the department store brands of tanning lotion but they look fake and don&#x27;t blend in evenly. This product is easy to apply and looks like a natural tan. I can make it as light or dark as I want. It only takes a few minutes to apply and lasts for several days even after I shower. It costs a little more but it&#x27;s worth it. If I don&#x27;t have time to tan, no problem; besides, tanning causes wrinkles and dry skin. I saved money by driving past the tanning salon, enough to purchase the Faux Tan. Denise Massey</li>
    <li> I have used this product all summer and still haven&#x27;t had to replace it.  I am outdoors a lot and it is really great the first time you go out and are white.  This takes care of that.</li>
    <li> Ladies,&lt;br /&gt;Please,please,please look at the ingredient list.  Make yourself aware of chemicals that are absorbed into your body.  Parabens as well as dyes are cancer causing agents.  Is it worth the risk? Not for me, I don&#x27;t want to die to have a tan.</li>
    <li> This product is great!!!!  The smell is similar to a cherry-almond scent.  Used it with a mitt that was purchased with another tanner, which worked perfectly. It takes a little bit of time to get it on smoothly to prevent streaking. It looks like it has a green tint when opened, but goes on with the most beautiful brown tan ever!! Received so many compliments while using this!! Will be purchasing the bigger size when I&#x27;m out :)</li>
    <li> I have avoided tanning lotions up until now.  To avoid the &amp;#34;farmers-tan&amp;#34; look, I use Faux tan mixed with my regular lotion for a subtle effect.  I highly recommend this brand, as it&#x27;s a gorgeous color and looks very natural on my olive skin.</li>
    <li> I have used tanning beds and self tanning lotions. This is a good lotion for beginners and anyone looking for a basic light tan.</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered.  Love the product. Would recommend to friends.  have used it before and it works just as advertised</li>
    <li> Love the color! So easy to apply and does not turn your skin orange whats so ever. It honestly looks like ive been going tanning with only one application. Recommend to anyone that loves to tan!The brush that comes with faux tan is awesome, I recommend buying them together</li>
    <li> I use this all the time and have used it for many years. This will always be my go to for looking tanner. I did find it a lot easier to wear gloves because your hands may end up a shade darker than your body. If that is the case just make sure to put lotion on your hands before applying the Faux Tan</li>
    <li> Have used it for years and have turned it on to many friends.  Looks natural and doesn&#x27;t have that horrible odor many do.</li>
    <li> Nice tan, best to use gloves to apply. Lasts about 3 days strong. Very easy to use, does transfer to your clothes, but washes out. It&#x27;s my favorite self tanner.</li>
    <li> I have been using self tanning lotions for quite a few years now and this is the best of the best! You can&#x27;t beat the price and you know with Bare Escentuals you&#x27;re getting the best thing for your skin. There is a very slight hint of self tanner smell but it&#x27;s so faint and doesn&#x27;t have the usual self tanner smell. Goes on very smoothly and absorbs quickly. You start to see color in about a 1/2 hr, and fully develops with more time. I did buy the brush...I think wearing latex gloves would be better though. The only slightly negative thing I have to say is it really stains your palms if you don&#x27;t wear gloves or use the brush so beware of that. Otherwise this is literally the best self tanner I have ever used. I had researched it for a few months before I bought it. Save yourself the trouble. It&#x27;s the best. Period. You will LOVE it :)</li>
    <li> I love the golden glow that Faux Tan gives my skin.  I am not \\&quot;ashy\\&quot; or \\&quot;orange\\&quot; looking.  Think of J Lo&#x27;s skin color and that&#x27;s the color that you achieve from this product.  I am Hispanic but it looks better than a tan I would get from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a scrub to remove any dead skin cells and then put on my Faux Tan.  One of the best things is that you see EXACTLY where this product is going on your skin.  You cannot mess up.  Color lasts for at least 1 - 2 months.  This is the best self tanner that I have found so far.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> My quest for the perfect self-tanner continues...    Pros:  - This product has an unexpectedly pleasant almond smell, and I haven&#x27;t noticed the tell tell \\&quot;self-tanner fragrance\\&quot; while using it.  - The color is not orange.  - It applies smoothly and feels soft, not sticky on skin.  - Blends very well with the Bare Escentuals tan brush which I HIGHLY recommend.    Cons:  - While the product description says that you can see it going on it is VERY subtle and while large clumps of product are visible to be rubbed in, missed spots can (and in my case did) happen.  - The color is a little yellow/green, not quite the bronze glow I was hoping for. Perhaps better than erring on the side of being an Oompa-Loompa?  Surely there exists a happy medium.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this formula.  No streaks, NO ORANGE -&amp;#62; the most important thing to me.  Even my boyfriend secretly uses it!  This is on my MUST HAVEs and it should be on yours too!</li>
    <li> BEST self tanner I have ever used!!!!!  And I have tried them all</li>
    <li> Ive used them all and this is my favorite. Easy to see where it is going. I apply it with gloves the night before and rinse off the next morning. That gets rid of the slight odor, but is long enough to let the color set in. The brush is hard to use and waste a lot of the product. You will darken over night so dont apply more than one coat at a time.</li>
    <li> Good product providing a nice \\&quot;normal\\&quot; looking tan. Pleasant smell. Lasts a few days with a single application.  Deepen tan with 2 layers in one day.</li>
    <li> I am naturally pale skinned and I hate using sunless tanners just because it normaly makes me orange. This product is so much more and holds to its word \\&quot;better than real\\&quot;. It gives my skin a warm sun kissed glow even on my face. I can officially say I love this product!!</li>
    <li> I;ve used better self tanner than this one. I&#x27;ve used a lot and would say this is medocre.  It is similar to sunlabs accept for my skin tone sunlabs works better.  I have light hair with freckles.</li>
    <li> Best self tanner EVER. But where is the 16oz size that I&#x27;ve been able to order in the past???</li>
    <li> I have tried probably 30+ different products, and by far I personally consider this one the BEST. Why? Easy to apply, smooth, no streaks, double layer makes my skin look like I spend last two months sunbathing in Hawaii! I get this nice deep mature tan! LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;When its time to fade a bit, its not orangy, but goes away like a real tan, gradually. I highly recommend this product, eben if it costs a bit more - this one is actually WORTH every cent.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin  and this color is very natural for my face and neck. Exfoliate and moisturize and you&#x27;re all set</li>
    <li> Stains your hands big time. I work fast at application..,but my hands still end up with telltale signs of a faux tan. I think the are other products out there that work a little better and don&#x27;t do this.</li>
    <li> Loved the way the tan looked but could not tolerate the smell.....good results as far as the product though</li>
    <li> I find this product to be the most natural looking of the self-tanning lotions.  I have tried them all, sprays included.  It stays on for a few days, and just needs a light touch-up. I am very fair and never tan, especially on my legs.  This is the perfect answer.</li>
    <li> I can not be in the sun or use suntan beds so this is the next best thing. It took me a couple of times to figure out how much to use, etc., but it works great. It has a brush that you use with it and that makes it easier to apply and you don&#x27;t get it all over your hands.</li>
    <li> Very strong color; stain-prone, so be careful. Small bottle. Still, quick nice color.</li>
    <li> cant say enough good things about this tanner its amazing ... never orange!I bought the brush also for easy application this is a must have !</li>
    <li> This tanner smells great going on but very soon the smell is like every other tanner.  It is dark which makes it easy to see where you have applied and where you haven&#x27;t. I would recommend this.</li>
