      <li>I was very pleased with the size bag I got.</li>
      <li>Love this!  </li>
      <li>Used for making my own sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Got this product to make my own sunscreen.....</li>
      <li>made my own DIY sunscreen and noticed it became clumpy</li>
      <li>I made my own sunscreen and it works good.:)</li>
      <li>This made for a perfect natural sunscreen for me and baby!!  </li>
      <li>Product is exactly as described and works great.  </li>
      <li>Exactly as discribed, great price and quality.</li>

      <li>I just added this to my favorite cream.</li>
      <li>It made a fantastic diaper rash cream!</li>
      <li>Wish it protected against the sun better.</li>
      <li>Great for concocting a natural sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I will certainly buy more from them when I use this up!</li>
      <li>Worked great for making sunscreen with essential oils.</li>
      <li>For the first time in my life, my armpits are smooth!</li>
      <li>I like the fact that it doesnt have a super strong smell to it, but it is so slimy and sticky that it doesnt do very much.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and well packaged.  </li>
      <li>And so very affordable!!  </li>
      <li>I use this as a sunblock and it works exactly as described.</li>
      <li>This really helped with odor control!</li>
      <li>Seems to work pretty well.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.</li>
      <li>It is exactly what it says it is.</li>
      <li>I like that it is Non-nano and 100% Pure Pharmaceutical Grade.</li>
      <li>Lol anyways, it is super water repellent which is nice,  </li>
      <li>And it really is I suppose, if you don&#x27;t have allergic reactions to nuts, soy, etc.</li>
      <li>The body butter by itself caused no issues, so this zinc oxide really got &amp;#34;contaminated&amp;#34; by the facility where it is processed with tools used for nuts, soy, etc.</li>
      <li>The packaging was very sufficient.  </li>
      <li>It doesnt mix well with anything and doesnt protect from sunburn unless you use so much of it that you look like a ghost.</li>
      <li>However, I was annoyed with the fact that free shipping was advertised and I was still charged 4.99 for shipping (still one of the most affordable options out there).  </li>
      <li>This was much easier to use than I expected and saved me buying special sun block with zinc oxide.</li>
      <li>I put half the bag and mixed it in 3 ounces of raw melted Shea butter and made the most phenomenal sunscreen ever.</li>
      <li>i recently became sunburned using an inexpenive dollar general brand 85 sunscreen and was determined to quickly recover, hence the reason for purchasing such a large size of the zinc oxide.</li>
      <li>I found it easy enough to incorporate with all other ingredients.</li>
      <li>You will be white, though, using as much zinc oxide as I did in my recipe.</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly, packaged well, the bag was tightly sealed and resealable.  </li>
      <li>my arms and face typically will become completely discolored, peel and flake and fortunately with my lotion, the peeling is still the residual from my previous exposure but the skin tone is the same caramel color on the inside of my arms and the outside of my arms.</li>

<li> I found this out the hard way.</li>
<li> Mixed it with some lotion and essential oils to make sunscreen and insect repellent.</li>
<li> sad that I have to throw away my body butter mixture and put away the product</li>

    <li> Great for concocting a natural sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Made sunscreen with this and it worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> This was much easier to use than I expected and saved me buying special sun block with zinc oxide. I just added this to my favorite cream.</li>
    <li> I use this for sun block in moisturizers. Works great!</li>
    <li> Work great for what I needed it for. It is exactly what it says it is. I like that it is Non-nano and 100% Pure Pharmaceutical Grade. I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for Zinc Oxide.</li>
    <li> Used this stuff to make some foot powder. I have some vibrams five finger shoes that I don&#x27;t use socks with. This really helped with odor control!</li>
    <li> Very good quality product.  Shipped quickly, packaged well, the bag was tightly sealed and resealable.  Very happy with it, the amount you get was amazing for the price!  I will certainly buy more from them when I use this up!</li>
    <li> Used to make sunscreen and it worked perfectly!</li>
    <li> Used for making my own sunscreen. Just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I have tried for sunblock, which works but makes such a mess! The reason I have bought this is because I discovered a great replacement for store deoderant, and even the online recipes! 1 part this powder, 1 part corn starch, and some essential oils. It works so well! I discovered I was allergic to store deoderant, which was the cause of really bumpy ugly armpits. For the first time in my life, my armpits are smooth! All the recipes online use b. soda, which burns me. This zinc is a lifesaver! It is a little messy to apply, but once you get used to it(use powder puff!)... Per one cup of this mix, add 20 drops each tea tree, lavender, then like 10 of frankincense. Adjust as you wish. I have not been smelly!</li>
    <li> GREAT price, great Qulity.</li>
    <li> Used this to make homemade sunscreen. Worked great!</li>
    <li> This took a long time to arrive. I made my own sunscreen and it works good.:)</li>
    <li> Just as expected. Worked great for making sunscreen with essential oils.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I have been using it to make my homemade bath bombs and toilet tabs, and it has not let me down. Great price, too.</li>
    <li> made my own DIY sunscreen and noticed it became clumpy so i double boiled the pre-made sunscreen and filtered twice with a  metal strainer. i used today in 100 degree austin, tx heat and i got no irritation or tan or sunburn. i am caramel complexioned and when i unfortunately don&#x27;t have any products nearby while working out in the sun, i can burn to the color of milk chocolate which is uncomfortable because my face will feel tight, become bright red and peel excessively. i recently became sunburned using an inexpenive dollar general brand 85 sunscreen and was determined to quickly recover, hence the reason for purchasing such a large size of the zinc oxide. my arms and face typically will become completely discolored, peel and flake and fortunately with my lotion, the peeling is still the residual from my previous exposure but the skin tone is the same caramel color on the inside of my arms and the outside of my arms. my face hasn&#x27;t tanned or sunburned.</li>
    <li> Seems to work pretty well. Mixed it with some lotion and essential oils to make sunscreen and insect repellent. No burns or bites yet.</li>
    <li> Broke out in red rashes/bumps when using this zinc oxide in body butter mixture. The body butter by itself caused no issues, so this zinc oxide really got &amp;#34;contaminated&amp;#34; by the facility where it is processed with tools used for nuts, soy, etc. So, beware if you have allergic reactions to these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very sad that I have to throw away my body butter mixture and put away the product, I thought it was really good value when I bought it. And it really is I suppose, if you don&#x27;t have allergic reactions to nuts, soy, etc.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t wait to try this...</li>
    <li> The packaging was very sufficient.  I have already tried it in a lotion Sunscreen. I found it easy enough to incorporate with all other ingredients. Great coverage!</li>
    <li> Used for home made suncreen. Good value , but leaked out a bit in transit. No big deal</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and well packaged.  Product is exactly as described and works great.  I will order again.</li>
    <li> Love this!  I use it to make my own sunblock that doesn&#x27;t include all the crap!  This stuff works!</li>
    <li> I use this as a sunblock and it works exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Zinc Oxide - NON NANO - 100% Pure Pharmaceutical Grade works great in my soaps and lotion bars. My nest project is screen block. Great service.</li>
    <li> prompt shipping, good value. I look forward to using in my lotions. It would be great if the product came in a re sealable bag thoug.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. I purchased for use in sunscreen bars and it has worked well.</li>
    <li> The product was just what I expected.  Arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> We made home&lt;br /&gt;Made sunscreen and it worked well.</li>
    <li> Exactly as discribed, great price and quality. It made a fantastic diaper rash cream!</li>
    <li> works great in my homemade sunscreen</li>
    <li> I put half the bag and mixed it in 3 ounces of raw melted Shea butter and made the most phenomenal sunscreen ever. It will be creamy and white. The water doesn&#x27;t get through it for about 4 hours. I never imagined this would be waterproof, but it is. I used it at Aquatica in Orlando for 4 hours and I was still covered in sunscreen when I got home. The zinc oxide just binds to the skin and nothing gets through it. It&#x27;s great. No sunburn at all. You only need to apply very little sunscreen to the skin. You will be white, though, using as much zinc oxide as I did in my recipe. It works.</li>
    <li> Item arrived in a timely manner. Very happy.</li>
    <li> This made for a perfect natural sunscreen for me and baby!!  No more worries about spending a fortune on wholesome products or using harsh chemicals on her soft skin.  This was a wonderful solution.  And so very affordable!!  However, I was annoyed with the fact that free shipping was advertised and I was still charged 4.99 for shipping (still one of the most affordable options out there).  If it had not been for the shipping incident, this was an easy 5 stars!!</li>
    <li> Worked great in homemade sunscreen and Chapstick.</li>
    <li> Got this product to make my own sunscreen..... Great product !</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the size bag I got. However, I dont think this is very good quality powder. It doesnt mix well with anything and doesnt protect from sunburn unless you use so much of it that you look like a ghost. I like the fact that it doesnt have a super strong smell to it, but it is so slimy and sticky that it doesnt do very much. DO NOT USE ZINC OXIDE IN CLOTH DIAPERS UNLESS YOU STRIP THEM. I found this out the hard way. Lol anyways, it is super water repellent which is nice,  and it comes off with soap and water. Wish it protected against the sun better.</li>
