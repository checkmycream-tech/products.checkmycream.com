      <li>I&#x27;m not even sure why Amazon is allowing this to be sold.  </li>

      <li>AND GOT A BETTER DEAL.</li>
      <li>I realized that many of the items were also expired.   </li>
      <li>TO ME I COULD HAVE DONE BETTER AT THE THE DOLLAR STORE.</li>
      <li>lol thanks for the products</li>
      <li>but I found over 80 usefull items, packaging was good, it can be better if they add some shipping nuts in them to secure the package,  but honestly such a great deal, most of the items have a tags of $4.99 and up.</li>
      <li>You could easily get just as much in better quality and the colours you want just by hunting bargain sales at CVS or wal-mart.</li>
      <li>there were so many great items in there such as many diffrent shades of foundation and lip gloss, so</li>
      <li>They break easily.</li>
      <li>Someone taking broke &amp; expired makeup that sells in cheap drugstores.... and turning around to sell to u for a LOT MORE than it&#x27;ll ever be worth!</li>
      <li>Super warehouse bargain!</li>
      <li>and there is the HUGE chance ur not gonna get the colors u want or the colors that go with ur skin tone.</li>
      <li>I was happy with the items received and would definitely re purchase.</li>
      <li>Of course, there were some things that I didn&#x27;t love, so I just gave them away as gifts (everyone wins in this situation).</li>
      <li>overall great investment.</li>
      <li>I knew it was cheap dollar store junk.</li>
      <li>Okay so, i did not buy this product, but honestly, from the picture, it&#x27;s obvious that the makeup is cheap.</li>
      <li>One of these supposed \\&quot;happy customers\\&quot; wrote the exact same review 12 times.</li>
      <li>is not that good one 100 piece same price of indivedual not worht it</li>
      <li>I really like most of the makeup I have received.</li>
      <li>First off if you look at their pictures, their \\&quot;department\\&quot; \\&quot;high-end\\&quot; designer make-up brands are all cheap drug store brands.  </li>
      <li>Most of the products are old and expired and you can get 99.9% of it at a Dollar Store!</li>
      <li>I own the same pallets that were on the pics..</li>
      <li>so i know that this is not at all worth the money.</li>
      <li>The fact that the items were a surprise was exciting and fun..</li>
      <li>and it is well worth the investment.  </li>
      <li>I have purchased this lot many times ,especially for christmass time and gave out more than 30-40 gift basket full of NEW makeup, lot was assorted, however it has some repeat in it.</li>
      <li>Eyeliner came in very,very light blue and light gray.</li>
      <li>I was skeptical about ordering this at first, but am happy that I did!</li>
      <li>I WILL SEEK LEGAL ACTIONS NOW!</li>
      <li>First off...</li>
      <li>After finally being able to mail it back ( over 18.00 more dollars) I recieve a 10.00 credit thats it .</li>
      <li>and my girls love red</li>
      <li>and there were way to many red lipsticks.</li>
      <li>I would&#x27;ve liked to have known, the blushes would be broken, no eye shadows would be in it and that the eye liner colors are colors no one wears for the most part.</li>
      <li>None of the positive reviews that I saw were verified.</li>
      <li>Before you buy this please look at the positive reviews.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and efficient.</li>
      <li>Absolute trustworthy supplier.</li>
      <li>and I got a whole bunch of crappy,  expired ,</li>
      <li>I wish I would have spent that amount of money on something more dependable.</li>
      <li>Its a scam more or less.</li>
      <li>The only thing that was nice was the translucent powders,lip gloss and a few foundations.</li>
      <li>The make up looks very old and looks nothing like the picture here.</li>
      <li>Most of these products, in the drug store, are usually $5.00 and up</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all old expired makeup!</li>
      <li>Amazon actually verified the purchase, and all the positive reviews all seem to not be verified by amazon...</li>
      <li>Half of all this make up on this sellers pics you can buy in whole sale!!!</li>
      <li>i read both good and bad reviews here and thought 100 bucks is worth to risk</li>
      <li>(all with OLD discontinued packaging).  </li>
      <li>n Wild, Cover Girl or NYC.</li>
      <li>Do not buy this the make up you get is old.</li>
      <li>n Wild, Maybelline, and Cover Girl</li>
      <li>It seems to me that the company is trying to make money by selling old and damage items, this is a scam.  </li>
      <li>The name brand like wetn&#x27; wild.</li>
      <li>The cover girl brand make up was old, some of it still had the clearance stickers on it.</li>
      <li>Makeup is obviously clearance items from other stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You would be lucky to get 20 pieces of quality makeup for $100.</li>
      <li>Its not Wet</li>
      <li>when i finally bought it i was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>Some of he make up I got was for African American and some looked like it was pla makeup for a three year old.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i read both good and bad reviews here and thought 100 bucks is worth to risk bc i work at a beauty salon and my colleagues and i need lots of diffrent types and shades of make up on the daily basis and we spend over 200 a month for way less make up than there was in this purchase. when i finally bought it i was very pleasantly surprised. there were so many great items in there such as many diffrent shades of foundation and lip gloss, so i dont know if they changed the quality as the result of the bad reviews or that the other people in here had way high expectations on a 100$ wholesale purchase!!! either way im very happy with mine.</li>
    <li> Half of all this make up on this sellers pics you can buy in whole sale!!! I have.... I didnt buy this and I never will!!! The eye shadow shown LA Color sucks.. I own the same pallets that were on the pics.. The pigmentation on them suck.. They break easily. The make up bottels look like Cover Girl Make up.... DO NOT BUY!!!!</li>
    <li> I have not and will not purchase this. Read through the reviews, all the negative ones were from people Amazon actually verified the purchase, and all the positive reviews all seem to not be verified by amazon...gee I wonder why???</li>
    <li> This was the worst deal ever!! 90% of all make up was expired since 2008,the blushes came broken and all the eye liners were complitely dried. There are some nail polishes that I can use it but for this price $119,00 + shipping I should had spent in a drugstore!! DO NOT BUY IT !!</li>
    <li> i was so disappointed. Everything was old and some pieces were broken. Some had even been used. I threw 75% of it out and just gave the rest away to someone. I don&#x27;t reccoment it at all. Look to somewhere else for a similar purchase. Waste of money completely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not even sure why Amazon is allowing this to be sold.  First off...I have not bought this and never would.  First off if you look at their pictures, their \\&quot;department\\&quot; \\&quot;high-end\\&quot; designer make-up brands are all cheap drug store brands.  LA Looks? That line was discontinued YEARS ago which means you are getting expired make-up.  Other brands I have noticed in the pics are Wet n Wild, Maybelline, and Cover Girl (all with OLD discontinued packaging).  Ladies do your research before buying this...and don&#x27;t do it!  This is not wholesale, this is clearance drug-store expired brands which they are trying to pass off to you.</li>
    <li> I took a chance on this item. The person I bought this from had a few reviews and I choose them because even though the other seller had tons of positive reviews they also had quite a lot of negative reviews and were more expensive. I really like most of the makeup I have received. The makeup had great quality and good brand I would recommend this for anyone who wants to start a good makeup set.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about ordering this at first, but am happy that I did! I received an awesome variety of stuff. The fact that the items were a surprise was exciting and fun..it was like Christmas in February! Of course, there were some things that I didn&#x27;t love, so I just gave them away as gifts (everyone wins in this situation). Shipping was fast and efficient.</li>
    <li> Before you buy this please look at the positive reviews. Are they Amazon verified? Meaning it was purchased through Amazon. None of the positive reviews that I saw were verified. Do the reviewers have any other reviews? One of these supposed \\&quot;happy customers\\&quot; wrote the exact same review 12 times. Just be careful.</li>
    <li> Old, Broken... and there is the HUGE chance ur not gonna get the colors u want or the colors that go with ur skin tone. Amazon should be ashamed to let this be sold. Its a scam more or less. Someone taking broke &amp; expired makeup that sells in cheap drugstores.... and turning around to sell to u for a LOT MORE than it&#x27;ll ever be worth! Wake up People &amp; DO NOT BUY THIS PLZ! U&#x27;ll regret it!</li>
    <li> 10% of the order was damaged upon arrival, when I emailed the company, they never responded. The items that really old products, and colors choices I was not happy, for example, green, blue for nail polish. The name brand like wetn&#x27; wild. The cover girl brand make up was old, some of it still had the clearance stickers on it.</li>
    <li> just to let u know the products i recieved were not that bad. the 2 mascaras were dries up two blushes were broke and there were way to many red lipsticks. but all in all i did love the rest of it. and my girls love red so they got all 6 tubes of red lipstick lol thanks for the products</li>
    <li> I totally regret wasting my money on this, it was about $100 and I got a whole bunch of crappy,  expired , low end , dried out makeup products. only about 10% were actually wearable . it was horrible. I wish there was a refunding option for it. Some of the stuff was even so dry that it cracked. I don&#x27;t reccomend it to anybody.</li>
    <li> Stuff is really poor most of the products are heavily scuffed and wear out marks. There was some cosmetic liquid over like 15 items in the box. Alot of the lipsticks were damaged and covered by discount stickers !!!!. PLEASE AVOID THIS ITEM !!!</li>
    <li> This is not a good deal. It&#x27;s all old expired makeup! Only buy this if your getting it for a little girl to play dress up in and destroy, Because that&#x27;s all it&#x27;s worth!  Most of the products are old and expired and you can get 99.9% of it at a Dollar Store!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed when I received my package as I could tell that some makeup items were damage by the powder that was coming out through the tape, once I opened I realized how careless the company was when the items were placed in the box; then looking for the damaged items (which were many) I realized that many of the items were also expired.   It seems to me that the company is trying to make money by selling old and damage items, this is a scam.  Vanessa.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this lot many times ,especially for christmass time and gave out more than 30-40 gift basket full of NEW makeup, lot was assorted, however it has some repeat in it. overall great investment.</li>
    <li> Great selection of products  I got nail polish, eyeshadow, blush, bronzer, eyeliner, mascara, foundation, concealer and more -good value for money</li>
    <li> If you are on the fence about purchasing this lot, I say jump off now!!!  Most of these products, in the drug store, are usually $5.00 and up and it is well worth the investment.  Differnt varieties of makeup with different colors....What can beat that?  I will definitely purchase again from this company!!!</li>
    <li> Okay so, i did not buy this product, but honestly, from the picture, it&#x27;s obvious that the makeup is cheap. Also, the title says \\&quot;wholesale\\&quot; in my experience, that is never a good sign. I&#x27;m a big make-up geek so i know that this is not at all worth the money. You could easily get just as much in better quality and the colours you want just by hunting bargain sales at CVS or wal-mart. Do not buy this.</li>
    <li> IN MY EYES I FEEL THAT I WAS DECIEVED AND I DO NOT LIKE THAY I FEEL THAT WAY!!! I COULD HAVE SPENT MY MONEY BUYING PIECE BY PIECE AND GOT A BETTER DEAL. YOUR PICTURES ARE NOT WHAT YOU GET. TO ME I COULD HAVE DONE BETTER AT THE THE DOLLAR STORE. I WANT WHAT I PAID FOR OR I WILL MAKE SURE THAT YOU NEVER SELL ON AMAZON AGAIN. CALL ME AT 806-584-8432. ASAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this the make up you get is old. Some of he make up I got was for African American and some looked like it was pla makeup for a three year old. DONT BUY unless you are planning on using this make up for a play.</li>
    <li> Loved the makeup. Bought it as a gift for someone and now I think I&#x27;m going to buy myself one too.</li>
    <li> I was laughing reading these reviews. Who would buy this? Just look at the picture. Designer make-up is Chanel, Estee Lauder, Clarins, MAC, Elizabeth Arden, Benefit, etc...anything sold at the makeup counter at the mall. Its not Wet n Wild, Cover Girl or NYC. This seller should be banned for selling this crud. The reviews the seller made up are hilarious. What a loser. I&#x27;d file an A-Z claim to anyone who actually purchased this junk.</li>
    <li> The product are excelent..!!! they give you ..more than 100 pcs of make up ..</li>
    <li> even there was some repeats in the box but I found over 80 usefull items, packaging was good, it can be better if they add some shipping nuts in them to secure the package,  but honestly such a great deal, most of the items have a tags of $4.99 and up.</li>
    <li> I was happy with the items received and would definitely re purchase. Very good customer service. Absolute trustworthy supplier.</li>
    <li> My husband ordered this kit for me and all of the blushes was broken, there was no eye shadows. Eyeliner came in very,very light blue and light gray. All of  mascaras were all dried up.The only thing that was nice was the translucent powders,lip gloss and a few foundations.The make up looks very old and looks nothing like the picture here. I would&#x27;ve liked to have known, the blushes would be broken, no eye shadows would be in it and that the eye liner colors are colors no one wears for the most part.This would be a great gift for a teenager but not for someone in their 30&#x27;s. I&#x27;m truly disappointed overall.</li>
    <li> I ordered this so called make up and less then a minute of looking at what was is the box I knew it was cheap dollar store junk.After finally being able to mail it back ( over 18.00 more dollars) I recieve a 10.00 credit thats it . Im out of like 130.00 .It has been over a month of complaing and still no refund. I would never advise anyone to buy from this seller, just throw your money out the window, its the same result. BUYER BEWARE ! This seller kept my MONEY AND NEVER CONTACTED ME!!!! Is that not theft? DO NOT FEED INTO THIS SELLER I WILL SEEK LEGAL ACTIONS NOW!</li>
    <li> Makeup is obviously clearance items from other stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You would be lucky to get 20 pieces of quality makeup for $100. So 100 pieces is just red flag city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone want to buy 10 BMW&#x27;s for 40,000? Super warehouse bargain! Just think, you could give all your friends one, plus keep one for yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*rolls eyes*</li>
    <li> I was somewhat disappointed because it was just a hodge-podge of makeup, which also seemed like it was old.  I wish I would have spent that amount of money on something more dependable.</li>
    <li> is not that good one 100 piece same price of indivedual not worht it&lt;br /&gt;you can buy the same from stores with same value and same stuff</li>
</ol>
