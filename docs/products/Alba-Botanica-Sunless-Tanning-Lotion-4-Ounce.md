      <li>a nice \\&quot;golden\\&quot; type tan..of course, gotta watch the ankles and wrists, tops of toes....</li>
      <li>Good results and love the smell of this tanning cream.  </li>
      <li>I choose to discontinue using it, as much as I liked the results.</li>
      <li>So if you believe the stink is worth it give it a try!!!</li>
      <li>I get a nice healthy un-fake looking tan that isn&#x27;t orange</li>
      <li>By far the best sunless tanner</li>
      <li>I wish I could say I loved this product because as I was putting it on, it felt smooth, smelled nice, and applied easily on my skin.  </li>
      <li>First application is great and lasts 1 to 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>I have very fair skin though I am able to tan naturally, maybe this has something to do with how a sunless will turn out.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I would recommend this</li>
      <li>I love this stuff and will probably continue to buy it forever.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t overwhelm like most do.</li>
      <li>Most spray or lotions get to streaky or dont work at all....</li>
      <li>I typically love Alba products.</li>
      <li>My favorite self tanner.  </li>
      <li>I got many compliments on it.</li>
      <li>Produces great color fast without being streaky and I love the way it smells</li>
      <li>I started self-tanning a year ago so that my translucent self would stay out of the tanning beds, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with the results with products like fake bake flawless and Xen-tan.  </li>
      <li>and I won&#x27;t be buying any more.  </li>
      <li>I just put in another order for this tanner of Alba Botanica and will buy more of it again</li>
      <li>A much better tanner to try is also found here on amazon, &#x27;Carribean Solutions Beach Colours Self Tanner&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>There are just too many chemicals in it though.  </li>
      <li>If done right, you&#x27;ll look good.</li>
      <li>The rich feel of your skin is being pampered while you tan is nice.</li>
      <li>The color is great and realistic as well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Tan wasn&#x27;t super orange or anything like and had a nice tone to it.</li>
      <li>I have to do three applications to get a good tan, and at that point it&#x27;s a somewhat orange tinted tan in certain lighting.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great product - spreads evenly and looks natural.</li>
      <li>Turns out it really works good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is easy to use</li>
      <li>It tans nicely, leaving skin nice and soft.</li>
      <li>But product left nice color and smelled good.</li>
      <li>For months, I used this on my body and it worked out fine.  </li>
      <li>* Goes on smoothly and the scent is not too strong  </li>
      <li>Pleasant smell, and it leaves my skin soft and lightly tanned.  </li>
      <li>however I leave it on over nite and wake up to a lovely golden tan.</li>
      <li>I called Alba and fortunately they are sending me a coupon for their store.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a cruelty free sunless tanner</li>
      <li>and it goes on smooth.  </li>
      <li>I love the golden color this gave after just one use.</li>
      <li>It has a light scent that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all</li>
      <li>I only ever put it on my legs but they have a great sun kissed glow.</li>
      <li>so i tried this out cause it was relatively cheap.</li>
      <li>Subtle on my fair skin, smells great, and so moisturizing I don&#x27;t have to add lotion when I use it.</li>
      <li>But as long as you rub it in well there shouldn&#x27;t be any streaking, and the color is great once it darkens.  </li>
      <li>I appreciate a clean smelling self tanner.  </li>
      <li>Read lots of great reviews but this product did not live up to the hype.</li>
      <li>I have tried tons of sunless tanners and this is by far my favorite!</li>
      <li>seed oil¹, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond)</li>
      <li>It has a non-offensive smell and it&#x27;s nice to know it&#x27;s all natural and organic.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would suggest natures gate glow lotion if you want a natural product, the color isn&#x27;t as nice as the alba product, but it builds gradually so the streaking is manageable.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend! :)</li>
      <li>When I tried this product I was not expecting a dark beautiful tan, just an even glow to take the edge of my casper-like complexion.</li>
      <li>The smell is pretty strong.</li>
      <li>I absolutley LOVE this new formula!</li>
      <li>Or you could apply quicker than I did and wash your hands quickly</li>
      <li>Then I became pregnant and didnt want to inhale the spray.</li>
      <li>* Had to get a shot, luckily the hotel at that time had a doctor office, talk about lucky for staying at that hotel</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and starts to darken pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>It has a very mild scent when I first apply it which goes away completely right away.  </li>
      <li>Colors starts to develop after three hours, and does not give a very good amount of color at all if you are very pale like me.</li>
      <li>I really like it!!</li>
      <li>I have gotten hives from previous sunless tanning creams I&#x27;ve tried, and I liked that this one did not make me break out because it&#x27;s hypoallergenic and doesn&#x27;t have quite as many impossible-to-pronounce ingredients in it.</li>
      <li>Very streaky and the light, fruity smell quickly turns foul after application.</li>
      <li>I applied my favorite moisturizer - and am trying Jergens Natural Glow FOAMING gradual tanner.</li>
      <li>It smells good or at least okay when you put it on.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the first and only one I&#x27;ve used, but I&#x27;ve really liked the results with one exception.</li>
      <li>Here are the ingredients in the Alba Sunless very emollient sunless tanner; its a step up from some tanners, but just not as clean as I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Seems to develop less green/brown and more orange/yellow than most sunless tanners.</li>
      <li>I first found this when I was looking for a hypo-allergenic sunless tanning lotion.  </li>
      <li>It does smell a bit funny once it darkens (but not at first), so</li>
      <li>I use Alba for my regular lotion too and love it.</li>
      <li>Much improved over the other more traditional brands like Nivea - no streaking - and a nice warm color rather than the orange that came with the other products.</li>
      <li>very decent smell for tanning lotion.</li>
      <li>Best of all, it is less expensive than many brands.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My favorite self tanner.  Doesn&#x27;t smell or streak.</li>
    <li> I have been using this self-tanner for a long time now.  I did not like it as much when they changed to the orange tube, but the newer brown tube is much nicer.  Tan is natural looking, does not fade unevenly, and does not cause me any problems and I am sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use silicone gloves to apply, and tan stays four days at least.  This performed side by side equally with the very expensive Clarins sunless tanner, looked the same and behaved the same.  I always go back to Alba Botanica as it is the most natural looking and behaving sunless tanner I have used without any problems.</li>
    <li> I have gotten hives from previous sunless tanning creams I&#x27;ve tried, and I liked that this one did not make me break out because it&#x27;s hypoallergenic and doesn&#x27;t have quite as many impossible-to-pronounce ingredients in it. It smelled fantastic while applying, but as the nice smell wears off, the smell of the DHA does linger for hours and hours, until your next shower, which was a little nauseating to my sensitive nose. The biggest problem I had with this is that no matter how much I tried to apply evenly it did streak a little on my feet and toes. I had to exfoliate them in the shower again the next day to even it out. It also has a bit of an orange tint that all the other tanners give your skin, too.     Overall, not a bad purchase. ill probably use it again, but not all that I hoped it would be.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I am biased because I love all the Alba products but their sunless tanner is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve tried products costing four times as much but this is the best. Alba moisturizes the skin with its thick lotion, and gives a lovely color that looks very real. I was ghost white until after I used Alba Sunless. I refuse to tan outdoors or in booths because I have had skin cancer. Alba allows you to build color gradually; just add another coat the next day until you are as dark as you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alba doesn&#x27;t have an obnoxious odor, either, like the other products. You cannot smell it at all and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, even after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, Alba does not work well on my face but that might be because I don&#x27;t exfoliate it enough.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so much better than any other self-tanner I&#x27;ve used. The color is great and realistic as well. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is that it can be a little streaky.</li>
    <li> Produces great color fast without being streaky and I love the way it smells</li>
    <li> If you like moisturizing lotions, and want a little more color to your skin, just buy this now.    I use this for a full-body application (minus face) after a thorough shower and exfoliation once a week. During the week I maintain with other products that are a bit quicker/easier to apply (Loreal Sublime Bronze Gelee for the body and Jergens Foaming Daily Moisturizer for the face/neck).    Any sunless tanning product can turn you \\&quot;orange\\&quot; - it&#x27;s all in the application. If done right, you&#x27;ll look good.</li>
    <li> I really like this sunless tanner. It&#x27;s the first and only one I&#x27;ve used, but I&#x27;ve really liked the results with one exception. Because it takes awhile to set (says 3 hours after application without sweating) it can be a little inconvenient if you have to schedule to use it on a hot day or before something you know you&#x27;ll be sweating during anyway. In lieu of that, I&#x27;ve had a few instances where it wore away from my wrists or some place specific because of the waiting time. Regardless, I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
    <li> I am as pale as they come. And since i had a baby i dont really have time to go to tanning salons and im not ready to show my hot bod off at the beach or pools. Hahaha so i tried this out cause it was relatively cheap. Turns out it really works good. And the smell isnt too bad either. It lasted me about 6 months and i just ordered another one. I only ever put it on my legs but they have a great sun kissed glow.</li>
    <li> * Like the Sunless Tan Glow from  Alba Botanica  * Goes on smoothly and the scent is not too strong  * Though if it makes you itch, it could be the Cetyl Alcohol in the product  * Once I used the Clarins Sunless tan lotion and broke out on hives just before meeting a date in Vegas  * Had to get a shot, luckily the hotel at that time had a doctor office, talk about lucky for staying at that hotel</li>
    <li> I absolutley LOVE this new formula! Pleasant smell, and it leaves my skin soft and lightly tanned.  Not orange-y, or cakey.  By far the best sunless tanner I&#x27;ve used to date!!</li>
    <li> I tried this sunless tanning lotion because it&#x27;s paraben-free and was pleased to discover that it also works very well and doesn&#x27;t come off as easily as other lotions. As a bonus, it also has a really pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> Works great and smells good!</li>
    <li> I usually dont use lotions to tan, only micro mist sprays (for more even coverage). Then I became pregnant and didnt want to inhale the spray. I searched high and low, reading review after review... I settled on Alba, and am SO happy that I did! The color is great! I got many compliments on it. The only minor issue I had was around my wrists, but that was probably my fault, and honestly you cant eve seen it unless pointed out. I always put a layer of regular lotion on my feet, hands, elbows, and knees before application to minimize clumping at creases. It works like a charm. I had no streaking, no missed areas, and a perfectly blended tan. Highly recommend! :)</li>
    <li> Subtle on my fair skin, smells great, and so moisturizing I don&#x27;t have to add lotion when I use it. I&#x27;ve been using it about 2 x a week to maintain some color and it has worked like a dream.</li>
    <li> I get compliments all the time on my legs when I use this tanner. It is a very natural glow and not orange. Also, some tanners turn really dark on the first application and then need to be washed. Not with this tanner. First application is great and lasts 1 to 2 weeks. I shave my legs daily and apply this every to every other week depending on the weather. Plus this tanner doesn&#x27;t have that awful tanning lotion smell.</li>
    <li> I have tried tons of sunless tanners and this is by far my favorite! It does not give a bad odor and rubs I very well!! Perfect glowing tan every time! I will definitely buy this again! I really like it!!</li>
    <li> It tans nicely, leaving skin nice and soft.</li>
    <li> The best tanning lotion!!! Doesn&#x27;t streak or smell bad ( well as bad as most of them out there) as soon as you bathe the scent is gone!</li>
    <li> I order this product because it states it&#x27;s hypoallergenic, but it was not! I broke out in a rash the day after I applied the lotion.</li>
    <li> I have slowly been phasing out all of my chemical-laden beauty products for more natural alternatives, and I&#x27;ve had to compromise a lot as far as quality but it was worth it to know I wasn&#x27;t putting horrible things on my body!  I started self-tanning a year ago so that my translucent self would stay out of the tanning beds, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with the results with products like fake bake flawless and Xen-tan.  When I tried this product I was not expecting a dark beautiful tan, just an even glow to take the edge of my casper-like complexion. I am sort of a self tanning veteran, so I&#x27;m very thorough in my shaving and exfoliation routine, and I&#x27;ve tried several different ways of applying and I have the same results each time. Horrible streaking, dark patches, pale patches, and it made my face very very red for about an hour.  I have never had any allergies to products, even other alba stuff, I&#x27;m not sure what it is about this product that irritates my face so much! The smell is horrid and it takes forever to soak into your skin so you can&#x27;t put clothes on for a long time. The streaks aside, the actual color is very natural and nice, if only it would go on even! I have used up both bottles that I bought of this (hoping I just got a bad batch) and I won&#x27;t be buying any more.  I would suggest natures gate glow lotion if you want a natural product, the color isn&#x27;t as nice as the alba product, but it builds gradually so the streaking is manageable.</li>
    <li> Colors starts to develop after three hours, and does not give a very good amount of color at all if you are very pale like me. I have to do three applications to get a good tan, and at that point it&#x27;s a somewhat orange tinted tan in certain lighting.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use&lt;br /&gt;No scent that I noticed&lt;br /&gt;A bit expensive for the amount you get&lt;br /&gt;Dries/absorbs very quickly&lt;br /&gt;Wait for it to dry before getting dressed or letting it touch any material you do not want stained</li>
    <li> This was advertised as one of the best self tanning lotions.  I was very disappointed in it.  It didn&#x27;t do what it said it would.  I would not recommend this product</li>
    <li> I typically love Alba products. I use all of their sunscreen lines. This self tanner has a terrible smell though, and I can&#x27;t get past it.</li>
    <li> Great product - spreads evenly and looks natural. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else for a fake &amp;#34;tan.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cruelty free sunless tanner so I tried this one. It smells good or at least okay when you put it on. It definitely does start to smell very &amp;#34;sunless tannerish&amp;#34; over the next three hours but since that&#x27;s exactly what it is it didn&#x27;t bother me. It gave me a perfect golden tan look with not a steak in sight. (I am not a novice to sunless tanners so I know to blend blend blend and wash those hands) I didn&#x27;t try it on my face since I use bronzer so I&#x27;m not sure about that but it worked perfectly and I will definitely be using it again.</li>
    <li> RETURNED IT! I have small tight pores on my face &amp; nose - this opened my pores and left VERY DARK pigmentation inside my pores - had to squeeze each one to pop out the dark spots inside my pores. After I got my pores back to normal I applied my favorite moisturizer - and am trying Jergens Natural Glow FOAMING gradual tanner. We&#x27;ll see - I&#x27;ll keep you posted!</li>
    <li> This product gives me a golden, even tan that looks natural.  It does not have a perfumy smell.  It has a very mild scent when I first apply it which goes away completely right away.  Best of all, it is less expensive than many brands.  I am totally happy.</li>
    <li> I like the Alba brand a lot and this tanning lotion is no exception.  It goes on smooth and starts to darken pretty quickly.  Just make sure to rub it in well and then WASH YOUR HANDS because it isn&#x27;t dark when you first put it on so if you are new to sunless tanning you might end up a bit streaky or with brown palms.  But as long as you rub it in well there shouldn&#x27;t be any streaking, and the color is great once it darkens.  It does smell a bit funny once it darkens (but not at first), so when I use it I put it on at night so that I can shower the odor away in the morning but still have the color.  The color lasts about 2-3 days if you don&#x27;t reapply and shower daily.  If you reapply, it would last for as long as you used it.  I took off one star because it&#x27;s a smallish tube for the price, and because I was hoping it would be gentle enough to use on my face since it&#x27;s Alba. Unfortunately it does sometimes make me break out if I use it on my face.</li>
    <li> Read lots of great reviews but this product did not live up to the hype. Very streaky and the light, fruity smell quickly turns foul after application. Seems to develop less green/brown and more orange/yellow than most sunless tanners.</li>
    <li> Good results and love the smell of this tanning cream.  I appreciate a clean smelling self tanner.  Product line is one that I purchase often.</li>
    <li> I love the golden color this gave after just one use. Its not orange on me at all. I have very fair skin though I am able to tan naturally, maybe this has something to do with how a sunless will turn out.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I would recommend this</li>
    <li> Use this product all the time. No strange smells, no weird residue. The color streaks sometimes but that&#x27;s probably because I don&#x27;t put much effort into application and I have chronic dry skin already. The tan that comes from the product looks real. People always think it is a real tan.</li>
    <li> I have used this for some time and always happy with it. They used to make one with spf and I wish Alba brought this product back.</li>
    <li> I am a very pale person. I love that this tanner is all natural, but on me it comes out looking a little orangey if i don&#x27;t have a slight base tan.</li>
    <li> Oh, dear.  I wish I could say I loved this product because as I was putting it on, it felt smooth, smelled nice, and applied easily on my skin.  However, the next day, I woke up in a rash.  When I stopped using the product, the rash went away immediately.  I called Alba and fortunately they are sending me a coupon for their store.  Bummer that it didn&#x27;t agree with my skin though!</li>
    <li> This stuff looks great, looks natural, smells wonderful, and tans beautifully. But after five years of use I have decided it&#x27;s not worth it. Look for yourself at the ingredients. If you do a search such as \\&quot;skin, environmental, safety, products\\&quot; -- you can use one of the review sites listed there to search this item and see what you think. It looks natural but please check it out first. I choose to discontinue using it, as much as I liked the results.</li>
    <li> This product says it&#x27;s hypoallergentic and since I have sesitive skin and some sunless tanning lotions cause red itchy spots on my skin, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try........It&#x27;s not hypoallergetic!!like it states on the package.I&#x27;m still itching!!</li>
    <li> very decent smell for tanning lotion. Didn&#x27;t overwhelm like most do. I was personally allergic to it like I am with all tanning products. thought the natural aspect would change that. But product left nice color and smelled good.</li>
    <li> It was slightly streaky, but I&#x27;ll blame that on user error (impatience) on my part. It really does smell good - none of that weird burning flesh smell. Plus I ordered this because it was recommended as a cruelty-free product from another source.</li>
    <li> Great sunless tanning cream so far i found, i tried a lots of brands and this one looks the best, no orange streaks and great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I bought this small tube at a Walgreen&#x27;s on CLEARANCE for $2!I thought why not.Most spray or lotions get to streaky or dont work at all....but this is great..a nice \\&quot;golden\\&quot; type tan..of course, gotta watch the ankles and wrists, tops of toes....but that&#x27;s a given...you can touch up for a slightly darker effect! Best self tanner I have ever tried hands down!!!  Beats Jergan&#x27;s GLOW and Loreal anyday! Cheaper too!  Thats why I am On AMAZON looking for more!  Creamy too!  And of course, wash palms of hands..I used a pumus stone. Perfect solution.  I have sensitive skin, and no issues...&lt;br /&gt;My only adivse would be when putting behind the legs/knee let dry all the way...I had &#x27;white area&#x27; where legs were either bent ot sitting prior to drying..but under control now.  Last a few days...GREAT PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> I first found this when I was looking for a hypo-allergenic sunless tanning lotion.  This stuff rocks!  It has a light scent that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and it goes on smooth.  It fades but never streaks or looks fake.  I love this stuff and will probably continue to buy it forever.</li>
    <li> The best self tanner there is no ugly smell like others I have tried, this scent to me smells like bubble gum. The scent is much nicer and I don&#x27;t mind it being on my skin. The rich feel of your skin is being pampered while you tan is nice. The tanner tans in about 3 hours however I leave it on over nite and wake up to a lovely golden tan. I just put in another order for this tanner of Alba Botanica and will buy more of it again so I can keep the golden tan all year round.</li>
    <li> For months, I used this on my body and it worked out fine.  It has a non-offensive smell and it&#x27;s nice to know it&#x27;s all natural and organic.&lt;br /&gt;However, today I used it on my face.  I had to wash it off in five minutes but I am still covered in red blotches and my face feels like its burning.  I just wanted to post this as a warning to others - don&#x27;t use it on your face.  I suspect it is interacting with some other thing that may be on my skin, like my face wash or moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Much improved over the other more traditional brands like Nivea - no streaking - and a nice warm color rather than the orange that came with the other products.</li>
    <li> Its makes you tan fast. Put it on one day and next day I had golden tan and it lasts up too 5-7days, untill your skin cells naturally come to surface. I use exfoliating gloves from target before I put lotion on and the 5-7day period after to help shed the old skin.</li>
    <li> I believe I have tried almost every sunless tanning cream under the sun.  My coloring is pale/pink and my skin is sensitive.  I tried this lotion before swearing off chemicals as much as possible.  It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin too much, a little goes a long way and it did leave me with decent color.  I don&#x27;t aim for &#x27;just back from Brazil&#x27; dark sunless tanners, because it&#x27;s just too many problems with streaking. This one gave me barely any streaking and lasted a couple of days, same as most.  There are just too many chemicals in it though.  I have added the list of ingredients at the end of this review.  A much better tanner to try is also found here on amazon, &#x27;Carribean Solutions Beach Colours Self Tanner&amp;#34;.  Its  comparable in cost, much cleaner and actually leaves a much prettier, and still natural looking color.  Here are the ingredients in the Alba Sunless very emollient sunless tanner; its a step up from some tanners, but just not as clean as I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Aqua (water), dihydroxyacetone, glyceryl stearate SE, C12-15 alkylbenzoate, carthamus tintorius (safflower) seed oil¹, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, dimethicone, cetearyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, glycerin, stearic acid, ceteareth-20, butyrospermum parkii (shea butter), calendula officinalis flower extract, camellia sinensis leaf extract, chamomilla recutita (matricaria) flower extract, echinacea angustifolia extract, ginkgo biloba leaf extract, citric acid, erythrulose, isopropyl palmitate, lactic acid, retinyl palmitate, sodium citrate, steareth-20, tocopherol, xanthan gum, benzyl alcohol, potassium sorbate, phenoxyethanol, benzyl benzoate, benzyl salicylate, butylphenyl methylpropional, geraniol, hydroxycitronellal, hydroxyisohexyl 3-cyclohexene carboxaldehyde, limonene, linalool, fragrance (parfum).&lt;br /&gt;¹Certified Organic Ingredient.</li>
    <li> I have used about 5 other brands and this is the one I will used again and again.  It looks great, doesn&#x27;t smell funky and it&#x27;s moisturizing.  Others brands would streak and leave my skin dry, so I always had to follow up with lotions or do lotion first and wait around till it soak in enough to apply the tanner.  I use Alba for my regular lotion too and love it.</li>
    <li> When I put the product on it smelled really good. Did not that self tanner odor. After about an hour, my fiance and I were sitting on the couch and he kept thinking the smell he was smelling was from our new puppy peeing on something. It was from me. The smell is pretty strong. It gave a really good bronzed glow! It lasted for about three days on one application. So if you believe the stink is worth it give it a try!!!</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s name should have clued me in, but this is an extremely heavy formula. It does not sink in without a greasy feeling &amp; i found that it developed splotchy. When it starts to wear off, it gets very uneven &amp; it&#x27;s clear that you used a sunless product. I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Very streaky, will not be using again.</li>
    <li> As a super pale person, I had to do two layers (after scrubbing down with my loofah &amp; moisturizing bodywash before) but it ultimately gave me very even coverage and I looked like someone who belonged on the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend possibly wearing gloves because my hands ended up looking a little orange and grubby. Or you could apply quicker than I did and wash your hands quickly after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tan wasn&#x27;t super orange or anything like and had a nice tone to it.</li>
    <li> The great thing about this cream is that it doesn&#x27;t smell weird like all those chemical laden ones.  I get a nice healthy un-fake looking tan that isn&#x27;t orange and it makes my skin soft too.</li>
    <li> I was told about Alba by a friend and tried it and have not gone back.  It works as well or better than the much more expensive sunless tanning products I have used.</li>
