      <li>Ok so i recievd this item early so great bonus, after looking over the items and testing the equipment it is as the showed good buy, every thing arrived in sterile packaging as well so great, these items are not high end</li>
      <li>This company is very quick on sending my order out.</li>
      <li>itll fit in the palm of your hand.</li>
      <li>so I suggest to order some different ink but a great deal for the price</li>
      <li>Overall really great quality supplies and clean.</li>
      <li>But over all, beside the minor issues.. Good buy for 50.00  :)</li>
      <li>and it is most deffinetly worth the money, i know alot of reviews make people sketchy about these items just as i was but dont doubt this item, again, it was well worth it,</li>
      <li>the only thing i didnt like was that metal tips are of cheap quality but everything else was good.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my sister who is a true artist at drawing,</li>
      <li>The machines are cool for beginners like me.</li>
      <li>the only thing this kits got good is the guns, that is the ink that sent me to the doctor and hospital  around a year ago the bottles have TATTOOOO.COM AND A DRAGON on the bottles.use</li>
      <li>Not a bad starter kit at all .&lt;br</li>
      <li>It came quick and it works well</li>
      <li>Quick shipping but foot pedal was broke, but they did replace it quickly...</li>
      <li>I would say that you should invest in some better ink but other than that this kit is great I have done over 50 tattoos with it so far</li>
      <li>the power box works good but only goes so high but cool as hell</li>
      <li>Thus kit works very well for hiw cheap</li>
      <li>,came a day early before estimated day,cant figure out how to use this transfer paper tho, but im satisfied with what i got</li>
      <li>; This Isn&#x27;t Worth</li>
      <li>excited as i was worked a whole 9 hrs knowing when i get off work</li>
      <li>Although, they made it right immediately</li>

      <li>thank you very much</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve searched vids and none go into detail enough for me to be sure.  </li>
      <li>It arrived on the first day</li>
      <li>first off i didnt give it 5 stars because wish it came with a case and</li>
      <li>But only issue I have is they are more of a pastel shade .</li>
      <li>I am very unsatisfied, it didn&#x27;t come with everything you need to tattoo, nothing runs right, the ink is junk.</li>
      <li>The ink was good and the needles were as well but as far as the other contents of the kit..</li>
      <li>ive done some small things with it already and are good</li>
      <li>Then only got 1 oinment pack (i know minor).The shader works fine.</li>
      <li>Everything was intact and worked fine, which is the only reason why it gets 3 stars.</li>
      <li>get tis kit about two months ago and wasn&#x27;t really expecting a lot out of it because of the price</li>
      <li>Thanks for creating a beginners kit.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It came quick and it works well, everything was great.</li>
    <li> I see ppl tAlking about the ink . But only issue I have is they are more of a pastel shade . They aren&#x27;t really bright. I have had no reactions at all to this ink . Not a bad starter kit at all .&lt;br /&gt; .</li>
    <li> I ordered the kit and the shipping was pretty fast, but when I received the product, one of the guns was broken and the power supply was not working. I contacted the seller to let them know the problem, but they told me not to worry about it and never resolved the problem. I ended up ordering a different power supply and another gun from a different seller. The ink was good and the needles were as well but as far as the other contents of the kit..totally not a good starter kit.</li>
    <li> would buy again... done two tatts  it payed for its self you da best.. pick this one for sure thanks amazon</li>
    <li> The ink was bad the guns hit rong the needles were spred apart and the power supply quit on me other then that the nothing was good at all</li>
    <li> I just received my tattoo kit from insassy and i cant wait to use it, i would highly recomend insassy for a tattoo kit if you are looking for one.</li>
    <li> ive read most reviews for all the tattoo kits including this one and this one seemed best out to try so i ordered it \\&quot;as a begginner\\&quot; i must say everything is good, everything was there,works exellent,both machines good,power supply good, ink is good ive done some small things with it already and are good,came a day early before estimated day,cant figure out how to use this transfer paper tho, but im satisfied with what i got and it is most deffinetly worth the money, i know alot of reviews make people sketchy about these items just as i was but dont doubt this item, again, it was well worth it,with that said i hope this helps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;whitemice out !!</li>
    <li> get tis kit about two months ago and wasn&#x27;t really expecting a lot out of it because of the price but I was impressed with it. everything worked well and it was a decent kit. have done a few tattoos with it with no problems at all. would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought the kit i got everything i was suppose to nothing was broken loved the kit  my boyfriend did a tat on me and i had a reaction to the ink&lt;br /&gt;He also had one done on him with same ink and he didnt have a reaction&lt;br /&gt;was very happy with what i got</li>
    <li> great starter kit! got everything i was supposed to get on the day it was supposed to show up. the only thing i didnt like was that metal tips are of cheap quality but everything else was good. did a tattoo w it already and it turned out great.</li>
    <li> MY GUN BROKE AND THE FOOT PEDAL DOESNT WORK EITHER</li>
    <li> ok so i orderded this kit cause it had 2 machines and i was looking for a new kit,&lt;br /&gt;good things- it cames with everything they tell u it has,it got here before the date it was supposed to,package great&lt;br /&gt;BUT The bad things are- neither of the 2 machines work,the pedal it half broken,the inks are not that good..i sent an email and waiting for an answer either they change the stuff or return my money..ill keep u updated..so far i wouldnt buy this kit again..</li>
    <li> it was a great product i would recomend this site to everyone i know and its a great site thank you very much</li>
    <li> The power box went out so had to by a new one from a friend thank god he had one because i was in the middle of giving a tattoo to someone</li>
    <li> This company is very quick on sending my order out. I got it in a timely manner. I did have an issue where my power supply crapped out half way through my first tattoo but I email them and I kid you not not even five minutes later I had a response that they are sending a a replacement pack and gave me a tracking number.I would definitively recommend this company to all of my friends and anyone else that ask me how to get a starter set. Oh yeah I read a couple reviews about the ink. I does say on the order list what size ink bottles they are and the ink also depends on your skin type wether or not it will stick. Prism is the same way and any other ink out there...</li>
    <li> Dont buy this cheap thing!!! I only used it ones and got burn!! Now the power supp doesnt work at all!! And now i have to buy another one!!😡😡😡</li>
    <li> I would recommend this kit to anyone that is just starting out as a tattoo artist or those that are seasoned. The guns are made very well and hold up to even me dropping them a few times with absolutley NO damage! The kit was missing the razor and the transfer oil which was no big deal. I would say that you should invest in some better ink but other than that this kit is great I have done over 50 tattoos with it so far and I am still rockin!</li>
    <li> All i have to say is whoa my package got here almost a week before it was sappose to which i wasnt expecting, but AWESOME</li>
    <li> I am very unsatisfied, it didn&#x27;t come with everything you need to tattoo, nothing runs right, the ink is junk.</li>
    <li> Very nice guns and all equipment is here but power box broke right off the get metal prongs in back where power cord goes broke off</li>
    <li> was not the kit i wanted and overall when i pluged it up it was useless power supply didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Everything was great except the liner machine didn&#x27;t work. Although, they made it right immediately and I completely recommend this item!</li>
    <li> Great customer care on replacement articals Awsome little starter kit for the begginer. It has well paid for its self.</li>
    <li> Perfect had no issues at all I got my item quickly and was very happy with everything I would recommend  this product to anyone who wants to tattoo</li>
    <li> This was a great deal ND I was surprised with everything it came with.</li>
    <li> i like everything but the power supply and the foot pedal cuz i feel like im break it by stepping on it but everything else is good love the guns especially with the blue one with the skull on it</li>
    <li> Piece of crap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont buy it ,</li>
    <li> Ok so i recievd this item early so great bonus, after looking over the items and testing the equipment it is as the showed good buy, every thing arrived in sterile packaging as well so great, these items are not high end but its good for what most are buyibg this for to build them self up. As far as the ink i have been going back and forth i have found a lot of reviews stating the ink is toxic some say it was a bad batch  others say poor care of tattoo, my opinion ill go with a bigger name and personal opinion. Overall i give this tattoo kit 4 stars</li>
    <li> This is a nice looking tattoo set. Particularly if you&#x27;ve never seen a pro set. The items in this bundle are basically, smaller, weaker, versions of the pro tools. They look the same from afar, but on closer examination, you will notice that the manufacture took no pride in their work. This set if excellent for learning how to tattoo. A small investment to get your feet wet before buying the quality stuff. Don&#x27;t get me wrong; YOU CAN DO REAL TATTOOS WITH THIS KIT,  BUT A PROFESSIONAL WOULDN&#x27;T!</li>
    <li> some items in this kit are recalled!</li>
    <li> Got one does good work ink isn&#x27;t good you need a lot for coloring everything else deceeent ✌</li>
    <li> DO NOT USE THE BLACK INK. I&#x27;ve gotten many tattoos but when I tatted myself with this cheap black in I now have an allergic reaction. The guns and everything else is perfect but I DO NOT RECOMMEND USEING THE INK IN KIT!!!!!!</li>
    <li> this is a great starter kit has everything i need and more just finished my first tat and it was great</li>
    <li> Great for the price...</li>
    <li> Quick shipping but foot pedal was broke, but they did replace it quickly...now my only cencern is the ink that comes with the kit and the current recall</li>
    <li> first off i didnt give it 5 stars because wish it came with a case and the power box works good but only goes so high but cool as hell it small itll fit in the palm of your hand. the ink works good so far recomind u byeing another bottle of black though and the guns are niceley made i realy caint complain for what i paid for it i love it</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister who is a true artist at drawing, well she was going to teach herself how to use this machine. WELL, the DVD didnt work at all, so that means she cant put the inking guns together without the instructions or learn tips on tattooing because she doesnt have anything to learn from. I will not buy from this seller again and i will now have to find her an instructional video hopefully they will have the same inking guns for her to learn how to put them together.</li>
    <li> i love this product. my boyfriend loves it. he has already given a bunch of tattoo to family and friends.</li>
    <li> evey thing worx great just had the power box die on me one time did pro work on brother in law with blue tat gun red is toxic any were u buy n the yellow to</li>
    <li> Its ok.. Was speedy to have gotten to me with in a couple of days.I didnt get all that it claimed to have sent.I know its minor, but didnt get razzor (i know minor). Then only got 1 oinment pack (i know minor).The shader works fine. Plugged it in and off it ran.The liner having issues with settings. Instead of a dvd. Would have been better to have gotten an instructional booklet for settings. Versus a dvd thats later mentioned.The ink pics are deseptive. They look semi good size. Once got which where alot, still small. For beginner.Was good. The pictures, and videos that were on the dvd were taken from a chinese video (whatch out) copyright laws.. (hint)-(hint)...But over all, beside the minor issues.. Good buy for 50.00  :)~</li>
    <li> Everything was good except the power box that you plug the petal in was broke and didn&#x27;t work but then they sent me another one for free!!</li>
    <li> this kit i&#x27;m not ordering its junk and i&#x27;ve warned people on the internet about that ink tatooo0.com with the dragon,that ink is china piss and toxic,if you like infection order, crazy rick. the only thing this kits got good is the guns, that is the ink that sent me to the doctor and hospital  around a year ago the bottles have TATTOOOO.COM AND A DRAGON on the bottles.use the ink on practice skin,or pig skin,only WARNING DONOT USE THIS INK ON ANYONE OR YOURSELF ITS TOXIC. THERE IS ONE GUN IN THIS KIT  ,AND ITS THE GOLD ONE AND ITs A NICE TAT GUN, I DON&#x27;NT NO ABOUT THE BLUE ONE, YOU CAN BUY THE GOLD GUN FROM CRAZY CART FOR 8.00 AND IT RUNS LIKE A 50.00 MACHINE,I GOT TWO OF THEM .,BUT THE INK IS toxic. there is one thing in this kit that is good, and that is the gold tattoo gun, with the snakeskin coils i got two off them from crazy cart of them and they are the best guns i&#x27;ve ever bought</li>
    <li> Thus kit works very well for hiw cheap it is. I just did not like the inks.. I did quite a few tattoos with these machines and the work wasnt to bad</li>
    <li> first its not strong enough to make clean lines almost like the homemade tattoo gun witch i made the colors is  poor  its for rocky people i see and good for only basic tattoos</li>
    <li> The machines are cool for beginners like me. I was also looking for a how-to set up video and safety instructions. Thanks for creating a beginners kit.</li>
    <li> The gun is great. Various needle sizes and the foot pedal is sturdy (still works after having been kicked and dropped several times). However, the ink is shoddy. When applying, it looks as though the tattoo will be dark and thick, but it isn&#x27;t. In fact, it&#x27;s the complete opposite. The colors are beautiful, but the black merely resembles a dark gray and to be seen, you have to go over the tattooed area at LEAST a dozen times - and we all know how painful that can be. Also, the black ink irritated my skin. As all my other tattoos have always itched a bit and healed, the black ink in this kit took led to flaky, itchy skin, which scabbed before a good bit of the color fell off. All in all, use the gun, purchase different ink.</li>
    <li> Love it my power supply, they save my space. However, I wish there have more information like process maunal and tell how steps do on tattoo. But still best deal.</li>
    <li> This kit had everything I needed.  I was a little disappointed that it didn&#x27;t come with the case that was shown in the listing.</li>
    <li> If you are a beginner at tattooing this the kit is for you. Two great guns with extra needles, extra gromets, practice skin, and ink. Overall really great quality supplies and clean. Also provided is a foot petal to control the machines.</li>
    <li> I love this kit! It arrived on the first day they said it would and aside from the power supply and the gold machine,( which they replaced, free of charge) everything has worked great!</li>
    <li> so i get my kit a day before it supposed to come..excited as i was worked a whole 9 hrs knowing when i get off work im goin to practice with my new toys...damn..damn..damn..the power supply dont work.i emailed them they better return contact before i open the back and try to fix it my damnself..POWER OF DREAM</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Suppose To Come With 28 Inks I Only Got 9 And There Not That Good To Begin With And Also The Power Supply Sucks Smh ; This Isn&#x27;t Worth The Money Nor The Price It&#x27;s Labeled And The DVD Is Pointless -_- This Isn&#x27;t Even A 1 Star</li>
    <li> Well this kit seems descent I ordered it for a girlfriend as a gift and here I am a year later with it.  The problem is she never used it because we have no idea how to put it together.  Me and a friend managed to get some sort of proper looking tat gun but it does not turn on because I figure it&#x27;s not together right.  I&#x27;ve searched vids and none go into detail enough for me to be sure.  So can anyone help me put this together?</li>
    <li> Everything works well for the most part. I am having some trouble with the tattoo gun but it&#x27;s not even that big of a deal. All of the paints are good. the tattoo guns are nice its a good deal for sure!</li>
    <li> when i got the kit i loved it i thought nothing was wrong until i found out little parts were missing off the shader gun an the gun diddent work so i wrote the ppl an told them i dident want my money back or anything i just wanted a new shader to replace the broken one they still wont get in contact with me</li>
    <li> Was happy. you get what u pay for.</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect except one of the guns does not work other than that it was a great buy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband and I thought it was a great deal. Everything was intact and worked fine, which is the only reason why it gets 3 stars. The ink (which it comes with alot of nice colors) was no good! It fades completely away like the tattoo was never even there, and even worse in some tattoos it left scaring! If you want a practice kit then I would tell you to purchase, but do not purchase if you want a real tattoo.</li>
    <li> Anybody thats never given a tattoo can open this box and go to work if they have artistic skill.  The colors are untested as I purchased this for my brother, but he says they look good.  I live in Ark and the 5 days it took to get from California was a little longer than we wanted and in the end, we recieved a fairly ok item, but the less than Grade-A American standards makes me wary.</li>
    <li> Good buy I have been using these guns did a couple tats I am a beginner not trying to be a professional just learning maybe I will pursue it one day. Good starter kit great price for all that was provided. I did end up purchasing a better foot peddle.</li>
    <li> guns are great love the small power supply the ink it comes with is kinda thick for my likening so I suggest to order some different ink but a great deal for the price and I know its Minor but my kit didn&#x27;t come with gloves or  the razor and this kit ...DOES NOT ... Come with a case so u do half to order one</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in the inks the colors do not stay in they fade really bad</li>
    <li> great starter set, don&#x27;t use the inks from any starter set though unless they are a quality brand!!!</li>
