### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and I just loved it!!!</li>
      <li>Excellent  </li>
      <li>A great line of men&#x27;s products.  </li>
      <li>This is just a great product, not greasy, very effective</li>
      <li>good lord....</li>
      <li>Good price.</li>
      <li>Have been using this for many years with good results.  </li>
      <li>think the most important you can do for your face is to use a good moisturizer during the day, esp in cold&lt;</li>
      <li>I have been using Lab Series for almost a year and am really enjoying the results.  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t a magic solution</li>
      <li>I do recommend it to anyone :-)</li>
      <li>My favorite anti aging product</li>
      <li>Seems to last forever and works great.</li>
      <li>stuff really help reduce fine lines and wrinkles, and it makes your face look firmer and more</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the Lab Series Power Wash and the Light Moisture Lotion which do a fantastic job and are FAR better buys.</li>
      <li>the morning, I wash with cool water and mild liquid cleanser, then I use a moisturizer, like Clinique or (way&lt;br /&gt;cheaper)</li>
      <li>but it does exactly what it should.  </li>
      <li>Timely and efficient and exactly what was ordered.</li>
      <li>is my first intro to the Lab Series line of men&#x27;s products.</li>
      <li>Right after you clean your face (and dry it).</li>
      <li>Does a fantastic job at healing dry skin, or even just tightening skin after exfoliating your face.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recomend this line.  </li>
      <li>recommend giving this a try, it may take several days before you see a difference, and maybe you wont see&lt;br /&gt;any, but it&#x27;s worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The sample was fresh and white in color.  </li>
      <li>His product is absorbed into skin quickly, but then my skin gets a bit dried.</li>
      <li>Would recommend it completely!</li>
      <li>Definitely see and feel a difference from the first night of use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 35, and this keeps my skin looking firm, smooth &amp; even.  </li>
      <li>Then I bought this and it seemed old.  </li>
      <li>have sensitive, somewhat oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>It is a bit expensive, but has been a wise investment for me.</li>
      <li>, everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so just because you see rave reviews, does not mean it will&lt;br</li>

<li> Waste of money.  </li>
<li> I bought a few lab products all at once</li>
<li> Have read lots of recommendations from professionals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply a small amount of Lab&#x27;s &amp;#34;Treat&amp;#34; formula and rub it in well.</li>
<li> /&gt;It can be a bit irritating for some people, esp if you use it twice</li>
<li> Unfortunately this does not work for my skin type..</li>
<li> The stuff was tan colored like it was going bad.  </li>
<li> Like all products like this, the customer reviews are all over the place, from terrible to wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Trouble</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Did nothing. Used for a month, no change.</li>
    <li> I have been using Lab Series for almost a year and am really enjoying the results.  I&#x27;m 35, and this keeps my skin looking firm, smooth &amp; even.  It is a bit expensive, but has been a wise investment for me.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended.  No ingredients that don&#x27;t belong (but are often found) in a serum like botanicals, fragrances and alcohol.  Excellent  ingredients with a lot of solid moisturizers and antioxidants.  Have been using this for many years with good results.  It isn&#x27;t a magic solution but it does exactly what it should.  Penetrates well and doesn&#x27;t leave a shiny or oily finish.  My favorite anti aging product</li>
    <li> This is just a great product, not greasy, very effective and I just loved it!!! I do recommend it to anyone :-)</li>
    <li> Waste of money.  This product has done nothing for me accept moisten skin temporarily.  There is no visible change in my skin from this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I got a sample at nordstroms.  The sample was fresh and white in color.  Then I bought this and it seemed old.  The stuff was tan colored like it was going bad.  It is also a minuscule amount for $50.  1 oz?  Im over halfway done and I havent had it 2 weeks!</li>
    <li> Using this will make your skin feel softer and smoother, but good lord....there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;ll be paying 50 bucks for an ounce of this stuff again.  I&#x27;ve used the Lab Series Power Wash and the Light Moisture Lotion which do a fantastic job and are FAR better buys.</li>
    <li> Seems to last forever and works great. Although, doesn&#x27;t look/smell/feel any different than cheaper versions, I do still use this product and will reorder when it comes time.</li>
    <li> Good price. Delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Like all products like this, the customer reviews are all over the place, from terrible to wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Trouble is, everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so just because you see rave reviews, does not mean it will&lt;br /&gt;work for you.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive, somewhat oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really help reduce fine lines and wrinkles, and it makes your face look firmer and more healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be a bit irritating for some people, esp if you use it twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use it before bed, with &#x27;Every Man Jack&#x27; under eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;In the morning, I wash with cool water and mild liquid cleanser, then I use a moisturizer, like Clinique or (way&lt;br /&gt;cheaper) CerVe AM formula).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first intro to the Lab Series line of men&#x27;s products. Have read lots of recommendations from professionals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply a small amount of Lab&#x27;s &amp;#34;Treat&amp;#34; formula and rub it in well. It completely disappears into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;After a minute, I can feel a slight &#x27;tightening&amp;#34; of the skin, but no tingling or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;It is expensive, and you only get 1oz, but I haven&#x27;t found a better product for firming the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend giving this a try, it may take several days before you see a difference, and maybe you wont see&lt;br /&gt;any, but it&#x27;s worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the most important you can do for your face is to use a good moisturizer during the day, esp in cold&lt;br /&gt;weather. Even if you put nothing else on your face.</li>
    <li> Timely and efficient and exactly what was ordered.</li>
    <li> A great line of men&#x27;s products.  I would highly recomend this line.  Also use their hair gel, face wash and exfolient.</li>
    <li> I read some reviews that this would maintain moisture underneath the skin and repair minor wrinkles. I have been using this for almost four weeks but I do not see any improvement on skin condition. His product is absorbed into skin quickly, but then my skin gets a bit dried. It does not seem to hold moisture well. So that the minor wrinkles would appear back. Unfortunately this does not work for my skin type..</li>
    <li> Does a fantastic job at healing dry skin, or even just tightening skin after exfoliating your face. Would recommend it completely!</li>
    <li> I bought a few lab products all at once and I don&#x27;t use this (or any of the other ones) because they make my face red and sore, especially after multiple consecutive days. I googled &amp;#34;lab skin care burning face&amp;#34; and didnt find anyone else with a similar problem, so I guess it might just be me. I gave it three stars because I want to use it but I can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Definitely see and feel a difference from the first night of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see all reviews truly are all over the place and can only say what has already been said... &amp;#34;Everyone has different skin types.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the product didnt work for you, then it just didnt work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to use as directed. Right after you clean your face (and dry it).</li>
