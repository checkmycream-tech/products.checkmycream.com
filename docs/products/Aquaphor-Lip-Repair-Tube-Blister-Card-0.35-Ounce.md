<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have super dry lips and this product helped me through a terribly cold winter. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey, I go through it pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> I use this product for dry, chapped, cracking, you name it... lips. It works immediately and always improves the condition of my lips. It works great in the winter when my lips crack from being outside too much. I am also currently using Accutane. There is a reason why all doctors recommend this product for your lips when you are taking Accutane; it works. I simply never leave my house without a bottle of Aquaphor in my pocket.</li>
    <li> as promised arrived early</li>
    <li> Not impressed. Think my lips are dryer!</li>
    <li> Best lip moisturizer out there!</li>
    <li> Was not anything special.  Other lip balms work just as well.</li>
    <li> Moove over Chapstick &amp; Vaseline, this stuff is awesome!</li>
    <li> Thicker consistency, but not uncomfortable and definitely not waxy. Heals my lips and works great.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. My little cousin always has a dry and cracked lip after applying it I could see the quick relieve.Totally recommend this product.!</li>
    <li> Moisturized well! Does the job! would buy again!</li>
    <li> this past winter caused me to have severely dry lips and this did not work well for my dry, cracked and peeling lips.&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, after I used this up with no improvement I bought nuetrogena Norwegian formula Chapstick and it worked much better for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this with the biggest purpose to help my son&#x27;s extremely chapped lips! He had the red ring above his upper lip.  This got rid of it in about 3 days.  Now, he&#x27;s got a ring under his lower lip...back to work!</li>
    <li> My doctor is the one that recommended this product. I recently had surgery and needed something for my lips. It&#x27;s fine if you like petroleum based products like Vaseline. But I found one that wasn&#x27;t and gave this to my husband to use.&lt;br /&gt;Summary of Aquaphor vs Vaseline:&lt;br /&gt;1. Vaseline is 100% petrolatum while aquaphor is not entirely petrolatum (about 41%).&lt;br /&gt;2. Aquaphor is more miscible with aqueous solutions than Vaseline.&lt;br /&gt;3. Aquaphor contains ingredients like lanolin and glycerin while Vaseline does not.&lt;br /&gt;4. Vaseline (petrolatum) may be used as a lubricating ingredient in lotions whereas aquaphor is not used in lotions.&lt;br /&gt;5. Aquaphor is used as a base for pharmaceutical ointments unlike Vaseline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read more: Difference Between Aquaphor and Vaseline | Difference Between | Aquaphor vs Vaseline [...]</li>
    <li> This is the product that switched me over from chapstick to lip balms. It&#x27;s great, but sits on the lips a little thickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend Kiehl&#x27;s lip balm over this. But if you don&#x27;t wanna pay the extra money for it, this definitely gets the job done.</li>
    <li> bought for daughter who has very very dry lips.  this was horrible.  thought it would be great, because of aquaphor name.  it dried her lips out even more!  very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like the smooth feel and the sunscreen. It.s an improvement over plain Vaseline Lip Therapy. Unless you are sensitive to sunscreens this one is great!</li>
    <li> I was passing it out to other burners who had chapped lips.  No better test ground for this than the Playa, and it works great.</li>
    <li> Unlike other lip balms, Azuaphor Lip repair last.  I use it when my lips feel dry and every night as part of my bed time ritual.  I live in a very dry climate and dry lips can really be a problem.</li>
    <li> I bought the jar because I couldn&#x27;t squeeze out all the product inside the tube. Bought many small containers to put the stuff in. Have a jar everywhere. The BEST lip balm ever. Smooth and light but sticks which is important. Washes off easily. My lips are smooth and the skin is pliant.</li>
    <li> This is the lip balm I go to when my lips are badly chapped. It does wonders. I usually use it before bed but also throughout the day if I really need it. It does not have a fragrance or much of one, and it doesn&#x27;t sting when my lips are cracked. Great stuff and hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> I bought this Aquaphor lip repair for my 8 year old daughter lips. She had dry and cracked lips before she started using this lip balm. This lip repair heals dried lips, so try it and your lips will be healed and protected.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my Dermatologist and I have used it since then.  I use it daily and it has been a lifesaver especially in the dry winter months!</li>
    <li> this product works very well for son lips. I would order this item agian.  and tell my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Lightweight and easy to put on</li>
    <li> Easy to use and makes my lips very smooth. Will use as a go to lip balm in the future!</li>
    <li> This was recommended on one of the national morning tv broadcasts. The segment was on helping protect our badly dried out skin. I don&#x27;t as a rule pay attention to infomercials and products pushed that may be one of the shows sponsors. This winter has been so brutal on my skin I was desperate. I am pleased with the results I have received so far. I&#x27;ve only had it for a month.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff - great for chapped lips - Great to keep your lips from getting dry</li>
    <li> 2 years ago I decided to start using natural lip balm on my lips, I kept waiting for my lips to adjust to the natural ingredients but it never did!  In March of 2015 my lips got worse and I started to see dry rough patches on my lips that would not go away, that&#x27;s when I decided to try Aquaphor Lip Repair and this product along with vitamin E ( directly from the gel-caps) applied to my lips worked wonders! I will never stop using Aquaphor Lip Repair</li>
    <li> I know a lot of people bash the Aquaphor products but I am not a member of that club. I want a product that works to protect my lips in the dry winter when the indoor heat sucks moisture from every pore. This product does just that! I tried multiple products from the inexpensive drugstore brands to the cosmetic counters and little tube just works. Try it.</li>
    <li> leave my lips soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly especially during this very cold winter</li>
    <li> You need this lip balm for winter days with low humidity!</li>
    <li> For the on the go applier of lip treatment - this one is a winner. Love aquaphor with my all the might of my heart and this product is perfect when I have to reapply in the mid of NY winter while on the go.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It&#x27;s not very expensive and lasts for several hours on my lips.  It works much better than most chap sticks, even the more natural ones.  I use it in the morning and at night. This summer I may use it during the day since I will be outside more often.</li>
    <li> I used to love this product, and I still use it everyday, especially when I get ready for bed.  Recently, there seems to be a little grit in it, and my lips dry out a little faster than they used to.  It&#x27;s still a good product, but somewhat expensive.  I have used it for several years and liked that it was thicker than other lip balms, but now it seems to have a thinner consistency.</li>
    <li> I love having these to put in my purse. Works great for chapped or dry lips or dry skin.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to carry and travel with.  It moisturized my lips and kept them from cracking even in the winds of China.</li>
    <li> This is just OK.  Do not feel any difference using it so I stopped.  Maybe I&#x27;ll try using it again someday - but - for now - it&#x27;s just taking up room on the shelf.</li>
    <li> I love this lip product.  It is the only thing that will moisturize my daughters severely dry chapped lips in the winter. I put some on at night and the morning her lips are not nearly as irritated and chapped.  A toothbrush run under very warm water and then over her lips helps get the dry skin off and then another layer of this lip balm and her lips are good to go! :)  Does not have a mint flavor so there is no stinging either (big bonus).</li>
    <li> I have used many Lip Balm products, and they were OK, but this one is terrific. It really helps heal chapped lips - even severely chapped lips.  It is not waxy, and it works quickly (make allowences there for how bad off your lips are to begin with). I recommend it.</li>
    <li> the best!!!  I live with aquaphor cream in my purse..car and a tub by my bed. I am always using it on my hands and feet. I was excited to try the lip repair.  It is the best.. I was with my sister in law and she had it also..and loves it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great - I&#x27;ve been having issues with flaky, chapped lips for several months now and different chap sticks and lip balms were not really helping me with this problem.  LOVE the immediate relief I have when I apply this product and slowly but surely my lips are finally getting better!</li>
    <li> Aquaphor is basically petroleum jelly (vaseline) that has been amped up.  But the additional ingredients seem to make all the difference.  I love this for last thing at night when I am going to bed.  It smooths and lubricates and softens my lips overnight and does not seem heavy or stifling the way straight petroleum jelly does.  I used to use Vaseline Overnight Lip Balm until they quit making it.  I searched and searched for a workable replacement and Aquaphor Lip Repair seems to be the best.  Also great for chapped lips in cold weather or when at the beach.</li>
    <li> I have tried hundreds of lip balms.glosses, etc. I am so glad Hot &amp; Flasy recommended this one!</li>
    <li> Aquaphor is the only thing that helps my chapped lips. I get immediate relief.</li>
    <li> I put this on before sleeping, expecting it to work like any other lip balm, and I was so surprised. Within 30 minutes, the dead skin came off my lips (I almost always have chapped, flaky lips), leaving behind soft, moist lips. When I woke, the lip repair was STILL ON MY LIPS. Vaseline and lip balm almost always wears off while I sleep, giving my lips plenty of time to start getting chapped again before I wake. I would definitely purchase again. I love this as an overnight lip treatment.</li>
    <li> This has been the ONLY lip balm to ever help my chapped lips. Have tried multiple more expensive brands in the past, but this seems to be the only one that worked for me.</li>
    <li> this stuff works great, I live in a real dry climate and this heals the lips and I use it in my nasal passages. a lot of product gets caught in the applicator tip and in the end of the tube so I cut it open. scoop it out with a bread knife and put it in the cap for use. hate to waste it.</li>
    <li> I was recently on accutane which makes your lips incredibly dry. I even tried putting Vaseline on them for the first month to no avail! This is the only product I have tried that alleviated my chapped lips after about a week of use. I heartily recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I had a small lump removed from my lip, and this was soothing to use as it healed.  I still use it often, and expect to use it several times a day in the winter.  Good stuff.  Much better than chapstick type products, and even better than Vaseline.</li>
    <li> I love using this stuff on my dry cracked lips. It works like a charm and by the end of the day, my lips are back to normal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been addicted to this stuff since I went on accutane 10 years ago and my derm recommended it. It&#x27;s the ONLY thing that comforts my lips and doesn&#x27;t make them peel or more dry like the other lip products I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve gotten family members and friends hooked, as well. Even my boyfriend relies on Aquaphor now!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. You only need a little. The only drawback is it smells kinda funny if you focus too much on that.</li>
    <li> Best thing I have found to sooth my extremely sensitive and dry lips.  It also comes with sunscreen, but I like this one better.</li>
    <li> I am an ex-chapstick addict. I used to apply lip balm every fifteen minutes or so or else my lips would start BURNING. Aquaphor is what finally helped me kick the habit, and now my lips are smooth and healthy. I still apply once or twice a day, but that&#x27;s a normal amount, I think... and anyway, if I forget to apply, at least my lips don&#x27;t catch ON FIRE. I like Aquaphor because it doesn&#x27;t hate a weird taste or smell like the Neosporin kind and the balm itself is very smooth. I&#x27;ll never go back to old chapstick again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I&#x27;m taking accutane, and it works better than other over the counter products and better than what my dermatologist gave me. I use this one as well as the one with SPF, keep one in my purse, one in my nightstand, one at my desk...you get the idea. Seriously a lifesaver for people taking Accutane. I plan on using it once I&#x27;m off, too, because it doesn&#x27;t really taste like anything, is colorless, and provides awesome moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s hard to find in stores but it&#x27;s usually there (albeit overpriced). It&#x27;s sometimes with Chapstick, sometimes around medicine, sometimes hanging in a display kind of on its own. Target sells it for as low as I&#x27;ve seen it in store (3.99).</li>
    <li> I recently started getting eczema on my lips.  They can burn, sting, itch, feel dry and start to flake.  This is one of the few lips products that will not aggravate my lips but even calm them down during a flare up.  I use this so much that I order it by monthly subscription!  I wish the SPF version didn&#x27;t have a harmful sunscreen ingredient (oxybenzone) otherwise I&#x27;d be buying that version too.</li>
    <li> Aquaphor Lip Repair has literally saved my lips. I’ve taken the acne medication Accutate multiple times and the main side effect is dry lips. Try using anything other than Aquaphor Lip Repair while on Accutane and your lips will be in constant pain as they crack and split. This is especially prevalent at the sides where your top and bottom lips meet. The only other product that comes close is Carmex, but it’s still not as good. Aquaphor Lip Repair costs more than other products, but it is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> This works great. I just got braces and my lips have been dry, this is the only thing that really works.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s normal Aquaphor, just in an easy-apply container. It&#x27;s great lip and skin repair and I never go anywhere without it.</li>
    <li> you can NEVER go wrong with Aquaphor.  Just wish it COULD BE SHIPPED WITHOUT SO MUCH HASSLE OF ORDER AMTS OR ACCORDING TO WHOM IS SHIPPING PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I am a lifetime user</li>
    <li> Very  moisturizing, but doesn&#x27;t last as long as a stick style lip balm.  But, I really like its more powerful moisturizing and tend to use it before using the stick type.  Adds a little volume to your lips as well as moisturizing.</li>
    <li> When lips are really chapped or cracked this is our go to lip balm. It feels good and lip heal quickly.</li>
    <li> This will immediately soothe chapped lips without feeling waxy - just as the regular Aquaphor (in the larger tube) does. There is a bit of a sweet flavor to this that doesn&#x27;t do much for me (they could have left it off for me), but it doesn&#x27;t detract from the product. This is completely invisible; nothing shows on your lips at all. It&#x27;s a great product, if a little pricey in this form.</li>
    <li> Very effective. Smooths and heals torn or bleeding lips. Great for someone who bites at their lips all the time!</li>
    <li> Waxy, oily, horrible taste, ineffectual.</li>
    <li> I love this i put it on before i go to sleep!</li>
    <li> I choses this because of its reviews and ratings, but I find it to not be either soothing or healing.  I&#x27;m sorry, but I am going back to my Blistex.  It leaves my lips smooth and protects them from overnight dryness.</li>
    <li> Well it is highly cost effective. I like it.</li>
    <li> Nice hydrating lip gel!  I apply nightly before bed to keep my lip hydrated in this cold weather!  Note it is more of a gel than a balm, but works better in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm! It&#x27;s fragrance free, and very moisturizing. It doesn&#x27;t last a super long time on the lips, but it doesn&#x27;t make my lips feel dry after it&#x27;s worn off like most lip balms tend to do. It doesn&#x27;t feel (or look) greasy or gooey. Adds a tiny bit of shine, but nothing that looks out of place. Good for men or women who don&#x27;t want to look like they&#x27;re wearing something very shiny on their lips.&lt;br /&gt;I have and will continue to repurchase this, my only issue is the packaging. Occasionally the tube will have a sharp piece on the applicator area where the plastic isn&#x27;t quite smooth, nothing harmful, but can be uncomfortable if I&#x27;m not paying attention when applying. When I&#x27;m at home I tend to put some on my finger and apply that way for this reason.</li>
    <li> Works great. So much better than the non-Lip Therapy Aquaphor. Also, try the kind w/ sunscreen if you are going out on sunny days. Works just as well.</li>
    <li> this is by far the best solution I&#x27;ve tried for my dry, cracked lips. I think I&#x27;m sticking with it.</li>
    <li> I use inside home and to sleep. Great!</li>
    <li> Good, just does not last enough!</li>
    <li> My kids (ages 6 &amp; 7) swear by this stuff. They both love it.</li>
    <li> THE BEST!!! don&#x27;t buy anything else!!!</li>
    <li> AWESOME for dry, chapped winter time lips! I ordered one for both me and my husband and it is helping so much!!!</li>
    <li> Basically a Vaseline type moisturizer. Works better than typical waxy chap sticks but more costly.  Limited sun block function. Easy to carry in pocket and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Great product. Not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> I suffer from extremely dry cracked lips in the Wintertime.  I have tried so many different brands, including one with antibiotic in it.  I bought this two days ago and my lips are almost completely healed.  It&#x27;s a miracle.  Will not ever be without it again.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my son.he is 1 and i need a lip balm to use on him as he gets chapped lips very fast during winter and we live in a very cold place. keeps his mouth moisturized and i used it on this cheeks too:)</li>
    <li> my 3 year old son is a mouth breather &amp; wakes up with the dries, crusty lips. then he&#x27;ll pick &amp; bit at the dryness or it&#x27;ll become soggy white lips if in the water. poor guy. big improvement after just 2 days</li>
    <li> i love it sooooo much , it&#x27;s sooo good and i put it on all the timme.&lt;br /&gt;it feels good and it wont be all nasty and oily. it helped my lips feel nice ;)</li>
    <li> This lip balm works exceedingly well, and works far better than just a moisture barrier.  While other lip balms have worked to stop further damage to chapped / weathered lips, this is the first non-prescription one we have found that actually speeds repair and healing.  On top of it, it is not thick, and seems to have no real smell / taste.</li>
    <li> This little container goes a long way, and it brings instant relief to my chapped lips. Even though it&#x27;s a little more expensive than other products, it is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Very nice for dry winter lips. Not greasy , applies  smoothly, no odor or taste.</li>
    <li> Boy, this really works!  My son gets terribly dry and split lips.  This is because he reflexively scrubs his lips dry after every sip or drink (OCD).  Honestly, sometimes when I wake him up, he looks as if he&#x27;s been out all night with the vampires because he&#x27;s got dried blood on his mouth, or his pillow has blood on it.  He also pushes large chips all the way into his mouth before biting down, causing the corners of his mouth to get cut.  I was worried that these split corners meant he had a vitamin deficiency until I realized what he was doing.  I tried everything to heal his mouth; petroleum jelly, Chapstik, medicated sticks, etc. and nothing worked until I used this stuff.  It made a difference right away and even the difficult-to-heal mouth corners are almost completely healed after a week.  Now people won&#x27;t think he&#x27;s abused or neglected, and I won&#x27;t be worried about him being in a gang of undead.</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED THIS FOR MY 6 YEAR OLD SON WHO SUFFERS FROM EXTREMELY DRY, CRACKED LIPS AND IT HAS DONE WONDERS ON HIM....</li>
    <li> The only lip treatment/chapstick I use since discovering it. It also comes with SPF for days I spend most of the time outside. Long lasting, never sticky, I put it on at night and wake up with m lips still soft.</li>
    <li> After \\&quot;Lip Butter\\&quot; by Chapstick, was discontinued, this was what I went to amongst other things I have tried. So far even compared to organic products such as Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint, and Yes To Carrots, this has worked the best. It would be great if the price was a bit better since I have these laying all over the house. Even three dollars would make this so much more affordable. Over all a great product however that seems to do better than others that I have tried and I have tried a lot including, Yes to Carrots, Bronners, Chapstick, Blistex (several including the stick and lip medix), Vasiline, Carmex (tube and stick), and Burt&#x27;s Bees amongst many others. I hope Aquaphor keeps making this one!!</li>
    <li> I was a actually surprised how good this stuff works! I have a problem with chapped lips and always forget to use stuff like this. It only took one day of a couple applications and my lips were soft!</li>
    <li> bought this to use while on Accutane. I cannot live without this stuff! it is amazing!!!!!!!!! it instantly repairs chapped dry lips and I feel as I can&#x27;t live without this. I am definitely stocking up on more.</li>
    <li> Great for chapped lips</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would love it as much as I did but even just a small amount lasts so long and really heals your lips</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service.  Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and Aquaphor is the only thing I can use that doesn&#x27;t cause a reaction. It keeps my lips hydrated all day!</li>
    <li> Best lip repair ever especially if you are an Accutane user!</li>
    <li> This acts as a gloss as well as hydrating and repairing your lips.  No taste to distort what you eat or drink.</li>
    <li> love this stuff.  keep one on my nightstand and one in my handbag, it works so great at preventing overnight chap, and I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a product that could do that.</li>
    <li> Other lip balms irritate my lips, but this works well.</li>
    <li> Aquaphor has been making quality creams for quite some time.  They&#x27;ve finally packaged it as a lip balm.  The lip balm is of a slightly different consistency than the standard aquaphor as it&#x27;s made specially for dry lips.  As someone who suffers severely from dry and cracking lips this stuff is amazing.  I put it on at night before going to bed and my lips remain moist until I wake up the next day.  This is sometimes 12 hours later.  The best part is it does not have to be applied with the frequency of standard lip balms such as chapstick which strip the natural oils out of your lips and is much thicker with a more rejuvenating characteristic than Vaseline which dries quickly and has to be applied frequently.  If you need a quality lip balm that you don&#x27;t have to apply frequently and will moisten your lips significantly this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> This is the only treatment that actually worked to cure my dry, chapped lips - and I&#x27;ve tried everything.  I use it alone during the night and under lipstick during the day.  It&#x27;s inexpensive and convenient, so I keep little tubes everywhere: purse, car, dresser, kitchen.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, excellent price. This beats much more expensive products.</li>
    <li> I use normal Aquaphor on my lips, and for some reason it works much better than this balm that&#x27;s specifically for lips! I&#x27;d also recommend Aden &amp; Anais Mum Bub soothing ointment. That stuff is magic.</li>
    <li> Best and only product that solved my chronic chapped lips. Creamy, tasteless and odorless.  I have tried so many other brands, many actually make it worse.  Summertime I would switch to a similar product with sunscreen. Price on Amazon is the best, I paid full price at the local big chain.</li>
    <li> Everyone in my family uses these during cold season. Great product for men and women and kiddos.</li>
    <li> I spend the entire winter with chapped lips.  It seems like no matter what I do I end up with dry, chapped lips.  Often I find that my lips will crack and bleed which can be annoying and painful.  I ordered this lip balm through subscribe and save because it really seems to work for me.  I receive a new tube every two months because I use it often.  I&#x27;m glad I found something that works.</li>
    <li> A good, basic lip balm.  My only complaint is that it has a heavy vaseline base.  But aside from that it is pretty good and worth the price.</li>
    <li> Let me say I am a lip product addict. I have probably 50+ lip balms, chap stick etc. plus lipstick. At the pediatricians office one day she said use nothing else but Aquafor or Vaseline and nothing else. So we went straight to Walmart and purchased the small carry tubes. I loved it so much I found the lip one on here and I have on auto delivery. I have them everywhere and so do my kids. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> The best lip balm I have found as of yet.  Second in line to badger balms.  I have a lot of chemical sensitivities and this is the least reactant of any lip balms I have encountered.</li>
    <li> Convenient packaging, but formulation is not as good as the Aquaphor Healing Ointment for lips.  It&#x27;s alright... on par with regular chapstick. Although it does seem to moisturize my lips, the formulation feels dry in comparison to the more petroleum feel of the Aquaphor Healing Ointment, which I prefer.</li>
    <li> OK, but not much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. Best thing I&#x27;ve found yet is Eucerin Intensive Repair Extra-Enriched HAND CREAM. Tastes terrible, but works better than any lip stuff I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> This has no smell to it and no harsh chemical.  Really helped with my chapped lips.  I put it on before I sleep and the next day my lips stopped feeling chapped and dry.  Ladies, definitely carry one in your purse!</li>
    <li> I like Aquaphor, but I found that this stuff doesn&#x27;t work as well on lips as regular Aquaphor.  It is thinner, and just seems to get your lips wet for a little while - It doesn&#x27;t last very long.  Regular Aquaphor can also be purchased in 0.35 oz tubes for roughly the same price, so I&#x27;d recommend getting one of those in place of this.</li>
    <li> Great stuff when you can&#x27;t find or can&#x27;t afford DermStore products.</li>
    <li> Of all the lip balms I use at bedtime, this one works the best.  I live in Minnesota, and this definitely works to repair my chapped lips.  One tube lasts a long time.  Also great for repairing lips that get dried by lipstick.</li>
    <li> I did not like this at all. it felt like I slapped oil all over my lips. it did not hydrate my lips either. I am disappointed. I usually like lip balms that have a thick consistency and this did not.</li>
    <li> This, combined with Cortibalm, have kept my lips chapped-free for the last three months while on Claravis.  My dermatologist even commented on how well my lips look and she started to recommend my regimen to clients.  First thing in the morning, I gently wipe my face with a Salux cloth, then gently buff my lips.  I rinse thoroughly - at least ten splashes of water - and then I apply a coat of Cortibalm.  Immediately after, I apply a coat of Aquaphor and voila!  I am nice and moisturized for about four hours.  I reapply Aquaphor throughout the day as needed.  At night, I simply wash my face with a bit of gentle soap (Dermalogica Special Cleansing Gel), rinse thoroughly, and apply another thick coat of Aquaphor.&lt;br /&gt;I have now purchased about four of these tubes and keep one in my purse, one next to my bed, one in my bathroom, and one in my car.  I&#x27;m never without it!  Definitely recommend this for those people on Accutane.</li>
    <li> Works well, stays on for hours.  Light pleasant scent.  It comes out of the tube smoothly instead of too much blasting out.</li>
