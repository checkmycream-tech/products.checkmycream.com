      <li>I  was lucky to receive this product at discount for my honest unbiased opinion.</li>

      <li>It has slip on for easy grip.</li>
      <li>It does take a little more soap to get the suds that I am used to but still well worth it because my skin feels great!</li>
      <li>Just add a little soapand put in your hand and clean away and they create the perfect amount of suds .</li>
      <li>This one is very nice because not only does it have an exfoliating side</li>
      <li>I normally use body poufs but this was a nice treat for my skin.</li>
      <li>The soft side is very soft and feels like microfiber which makes a great washing material.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and so it&#x27;s worth the price.  </li>
      <li>My family has skin sensitive when touching the chemical products except me.</li>
      <li>Its also so comfortable in your hand with especially with the easy to use slip in handle</li>

      <li>Much better than an actual rag.</li>
      <li>and then you have the soft side for smooth cleaning of your body.</li>
      <li>Great coverage and not too soft or too hard.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the creator.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really versatile unlike the cheaper ones out there</li>
      <li>They weren&#x27;t scratchy and helped the soap lather really well</li>
      <li>When I pour the water on it, the loofah&#x27;s part began to raise and it makes it ready to be used for shower.</li>
      <li>I used it to scrub my face too with gentle circular motion.</li>
      <li>I really like the product</li>
      <li>main issue I&#x27;ve noticed is that the threads are already - after using it twice - loosening around the edges (at the top).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>was very surprised at how much lather the sponge produced.</li>
      <li>After using this Loofah twice I can say that it&#x27;s not really for people who prefer to really &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; themselves clean.</li>
      <li>Now, with this 100% natural made sponge, whole of my family will take part of their responsibility for completing their works and ease my burden too.</li>
      <li>I like to try new sponges</li>
      <li>but it has a very soft side as well.</li>
      <li>I expected more than a single shower out of a sponge.</li>
      <li>Then there is a little handle that my hand slips comfortably into while using.</li>
      <li>I should have followed my first mind and purchased the other sponges I looked at.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s not extremely scratchy where it</li>
      <li>I wish I had not spent the money for them.</li>

<li> /&gt;I&#x27;m still concerned about the thin handle though... even when used gently it might not last very long, but I&#x27;ll update the review if it does in fact become an issue after a while.</li>
<li> It only took a little bit of soap to make a lot of lather.</li>
<li> Not performing as expected</li>
<li> They are larger than expected, evenly shaped and texture is firm.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s soft on one side and not too hard on the other.</li>
<li> first you have the rough lufa side to remove tough grime and grease dead skin</li>
<li> My dead skin around my feet is slowly vanished, this loofah sponge can be rough or too soft.</li>
<li> I used to use these years ago and they helped to trim down cellulite on my thighs</li>
<li> Gets too dirty &amp; absorbs too much soap</li>
<li> They exfoliate my skin thoroughly, I can feel my skin is smoother after using it for a few days.</li>
<li> But, my hand has appear irritating when long hours to apply with chemical products.</li>
<li> These sponges have very little expoliating quality.</li>
<li> Not too harsh, not to shabby!  </li>
<li> They are not much better than using a washclotrh.</li>
<li> The sponge is thick and it can hold the water.</li>
<li> so I am anxious to try them again!  </li>
<li> After a few days of use, the sponge changed shape and it is difficult to use it for what it is meant to be used.</li>
<li> These things are awful with a capital &amp;#34;A&amp;#34;!!</li>

    <li> OH I loved how well these worked. They weren&#x27;t scratchy and helped the soap lather really well</li>
    <li> in the web offering set of 4 I receive only 3 so upset we are 4 person we got 3 not 4</li>
    <li> Really great deal for 4 loofah body sponges. They are larger than expected, evenly shaped and texture is firm. This Loofah sponge was durable, it&#x27;s a perfect package for my entire family. It scrubbed well, it needed to soften it with water for a while, then it&#x27;s perfect to use for shower or bath . I  was lucky to receive this product at discount for my honest unbiased opinion.</li>

    <li> I got this product during launching promotion and here is my honest opinion about this 4 pack body wash sponge. These are worth it for their price,you got 4 pack of nice body bath sponges. They exfoliate my skin thoroughly, I can feel my skin is smoother after using it for a few days. My dead skin around my feet is slowly vanished, this loofah sponge can be rough or too soft. All depends on your relative opinions, but for me it is perfect. I used it to scrub my face too with gentle circular motion. It works amazingly! The sponge is thick and it can hold the water. When I pour the water on it, the loofah&#x27;s part began to raise and it makes it ready to be used for shower. Recommended buy!</li>
    <li> This is really good product. I used this product about 1 year ago. It&#x27;s very good for building up suds and washing your skin while exfoliating. I really love that part because let&#x27;s face it, things can get slippery in the shower. The loofah side is very effective at exfoliating my skin in a gentle way, without scratching.  I got these at a promotional price and was asked to give my honest and unbiased opinion. I would definitely recommend this product to my friends and family and will be returning in the future for all my Loofah needs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad that I found the eco-friendly sponges for bathing or washing the kitchen utensil. My family has skin sensitive when touching the chemical products except me. So, I&#x27;m the person who will be assigned for doing a lot of houseworks. But, my hand has appear irritating when long hours to apply with chemical products. Now, with this 100% natural made sponge, whole of my family will take part of their responsibility for completing their works and ease my burden too. Thanks for the creator.</li>

    <li> This here was bought for whenever I needed a long 30 min to 1 hour bath. It&#x27;s really versatile unlike the cheaper ones out there and so it&#x27;s worth the price.  It will last for quite a long time especially since you get four of them. It&#x27;s soft on one side and not too hard on the other. The handle it comes with is durable even with my big hands, it stretches without damage.  Freshly great buy here with good packaging and overall customer service.  I would definitely recommend to all the bathing lovers out there. Much better than the ones in supermarkets!</li>
    <li> Good Deal !! and recommended to buy it !!</li>
    <li> The pack of 4 contained only 3 sponges. After a few days of use, the sponge changed shape and it is difficult to use it for what it is meant to be used. No exfoliation achieved.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive my loofah sponges!  I used to use these years ago and they helped to trim down cellulite on my thighs so I am anxious to try them again!  These sponges are a great hand size sponge with a terry band to be able to put your hand through to hold the sponge steady.  Not too harsh, not to shabby!  I would definitely recommend to a friend!

    <li> Loofah bath sponge is two great thing combine to one.  I really like the product I it feel very nice on your skin.  I recommend the product.</li>
    <li> Gets too dirty &amp; absorbs too much soap</li>
    <li> Very good product. My daughter love this product as well. It has slip on for easy grip. It exfoliate but not too scruffy that it will hurt your skin. I&#x27;m enjoying a nice relaxing bath with this amazing loofah bath sponge! I definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Great to bath children with. Great coverage and not too soft or too hard. Much better than an actual rag.</li>
    <li> I like to try new sponges and I love loofahs they make my skin feel amazing because they have exfoliating properties. This one is very nice because not only does it have an exfoliating side but it has a very soft side as well. The soft side is very soft and feels like microfiber which makes a great washing material.&lt;br /&gt;I was very surprised at how much lather the sponge produced. It only took a little bit of soap to make a lot of lather. Then there is a little handle that my hand slips comfortably into while using. The loofah side is scratchy so it exfoliates my skin whether it&#x27;s on my face or body. But it&#x27;s not extremely scratchy where it hurts.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion but the opinion expressed is all my own.</li>
    <li> These things are awful with a capital &amp;#34;A&amp;#34;!! The first time I used one in the shower, it virtually fell apart upon contact with water. What good is a sponge that cannot handle water!? I expected more than a single shower out of a sponge. No wonder they give you 4 in a pack. They don&#x27;t expect these things to hold up. I should have followed my first mind and purchased the other sponges I looked at. This deal looked to good to be true and it was!</li>
    <li> After using this Loofah twice I can say that it&#x27;s not really for people who prefer to really &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; themselves clean.
