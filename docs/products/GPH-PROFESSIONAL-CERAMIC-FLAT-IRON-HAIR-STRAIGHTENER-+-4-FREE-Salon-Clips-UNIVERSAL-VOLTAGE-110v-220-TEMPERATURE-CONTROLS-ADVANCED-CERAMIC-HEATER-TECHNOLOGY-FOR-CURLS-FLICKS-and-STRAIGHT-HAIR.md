    <li> I have very thick hair and it&#x27;s not good enough for it. :(</li>
    <li> This is a nice ceramic straightener. My wife uses it a lot more than me but I use it sometimes when I do modeling shoots. This heats up very fast and it doesn&#x27;t stick to my hair or burn it. The multiple temperature settings make it very easy to adjust the temperature accordingly depending on how hot you like to iron your hair. Overall I am very satisfied with this product. I received this product at no cost in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> The iron for hair is an excellent product. I use it frequently. my hair looks super smooth and polished. It removes dryness. It has a temperature control that regulates how hot you want the plate. It has an ideal location for all types of hair size.</li>
    <li> Fast and reliable. It heats up fast, I have long thick hair and can do a pretty good job in ten minutes of straightening it. It comes with clips to portion out your hair. Great product.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot nor straighten African American natural hair.</li>

    <li> this plate is one of the best in the world because at the time of use will not burn or mistreated hair, is economical and easy to handle and very comfortable for when I travel and carry with me, all women need our partner us regale an iron like this</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for a relative and she loves it. Very good quality and durability, and it serves it&#x27;s purpose very well. She said it is by far the best Hair Iron she has ever used. This product is a must buy for anyone looking for a good hair ironer.</li>
    <li> Great product, worth the money.</li>
    <li> This hair straightener is hot and effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been seeing a bunch of skeptical comments so I wanted to revise my previous review. I agree that it&#x27;s a bit weird that this is originally a $200 dollar straightener and I only paid $40 for it... But this is a really nice, high quality flat iron. I was not given any extra money for writing a good review and I paid full price for this product. I honestly think this is a steal considering it&#x27;s so cheap and such nice quality. It heats up really fast and leaves my hair feeling really soft. I&#x27;ve been nothing but pleased with this product and I hope this helps clear up any doubt. I would definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also read some comments hoping to see proof of purchase so I hope this is what you were hoping for?</li>
    <li> I am someone whose hair absolutely hates any sort of flat iron. Seriously, within a few minutes my hair instantly starts curling right back up. Let&#x27;s talk about annoying for a second. Within an hour of straightening my hair looks as though it&#x27;s never been touched. So, I decided to put this ceramic flat iron to the test. And let me tell you, I love it! The pictures you will see below are my hair on it&#x27;s everyday mission. What&#x27;s that mission? To curl as weird as possible. The one next to it is 3 hours after I straightened it. It still looks AMAZING. This flat iron gives off so much heat that it leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth. It took me roughly 20 minutes to straighten my whole head. I added a little argon oil afterwards (heat can hurt your hair, ladies, so make sure to take care afterwards) and I was good to go! It&#x27;s now been another 2 hours since I took the after shot, and it&#x27;s still perfect. One little impossible wave, and that&#x27;s all. Ladies, if you are looking for a flat iron that will keep your hair smooth and straight, this is the one. The price is great, the heat is right. What more could you ask for?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. All opinions are my own*</li>
    <li> Great.  No over heating.  I love it.</li>
    <li> The ceramic is the secret for the hair. The professional ceramic hair is one product unique, is ideal for transforming frizzy, dull hair into perfectly straight, sleek locks. This product has the advanced ceramic heater technology disperses heat evenly for safe styling, as well as allowing the hair to be smoothed more quickly.</li>
    <li> This is the professional ceramic for my hair, my hair never has been happy, but with professional ceramic is other style, is the secret for my hair, I thought I could never get such a fantastic product. i recommend the ceramic professional.</li>
    <li> Be careful with the 5 star reviews. Out of 25 reviews only one is a Verified purchase. If you look at the other products that some of this reviewers have rated are for the same products and almost all are 5 stars. It looks like this product is Paying to get reviews. Amazon should investigate. I will avoid this product until it has more verified reviews.</li>
    <li> This straightener does not work.  It does not heat up, or rather it heats up but only minimally, and takes a while to do that.  It doesn&#x27;t get nearly hot enough to straighten thick or curly hair, it hardly straightened my thin straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair.  It looks nice, came in a really nice box, and the salon clips it comes with were a nice touch.  Just wish it worked.  Perhaps I got a defective one, since there seem to be a lot of good reviews.</li>
    <li> It is the best gift you can give to any woman (mother, sister , girlfriends or wife) . she can do any style alone, now we reduce cost in hairdressing and the long time lost here. my wife is be happy with the ceramic flat.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for style in a professional way this is for you . Like me . Fast and easy to use. And comfortably . The lysate hair style and certainly looks after initial use . I highly recommend for those seeking the best for your hair.</li>
    <li> i love it! i received this as a gift and it&#x27;s great, I take it in my suitcase to go everywhere , reaches the ideal temperature in seconds so I can be ready for anything quickly and what I like the most is that it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair like the one I had before, which made me spend much money on moisturizing treatments... with this the usual care is ok, more than fine</li>
