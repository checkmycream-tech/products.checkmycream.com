      <li>Its ok but have not seen a true change or difference.</li>
      <li>I use the shampoo and conditioner of this brand religiously and it&#x27;s pretty awesome.</li>
      <li>I have only used it twice now, so will continue to use it and see how it goes, but my first 2 uses haven&#x27;t been great to be honest.</li>
      <li>My little girls (11 and 12) its awesome on there hair too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It smells nice, but didn&#x27;t really help my hair.</li>

      <li>People stop me a lot to comment that they love my hair cause its so shiny and looks so soft which my husband would agree with :).</li>
      <li>It was worth a try, I have fine 4C hair.</li>
      <li>Masks for hair thick, perfectly nourishes volosy.</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m trying to take care of it better and don&#x27;t know really what to use on my hair.</li>
      <li>I have not used it long enough to give it a fair rating but my skin feels so good after using it</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a fantastic product I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a product that leaves your hair healthy manageable silky soft looking .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I use only salon products normally, but this mask is great</li>
      <li>its worth it 100%.</li>
      <li>However, I thought by paying this much for this product and it having reasonable reviews, this may be better than the conditioner itself.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many masques so far because I have damaged, brittle hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is sooo soft and hydrated.it FEELS healthy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just not the right product.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t find it anywhere near as good as the standard conditioner.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine and most products tend to weigh it down and make it look greasy.  </li>
      <li>When I washed it out my hair was somewhat soft and some of my curls had loosen up a bit but nothing fantastic.</li>
      <li>it came in soo fast!</li>
      <li>it really works, i used it right away</li>
      <li>Additionally, once it dried it was super soft even though it can be kind of brittle without this product.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t have that she sprayed on too much jordache scent....</li>
      <li>and it has a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t straighten my hair at all really, but it was a bit easier to comb.</li>
      <li>Made my hair very manageable and silky.</li>
      <li>LIKE SO MUCH</li>
      <li>This is a quality product at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>and I really like it.  </li>
      <li>Really like this product.  </li>
      <li>i did a keratin treatment and using this product to keep it straight.</li>
      <li>It took me a week of deep conditioning with my favorite conditioner, Dove, to get it soft again.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Shipment was good - and the product works wonders for my rough dry hair....</li>
      <li>Worked wonders in smoothing out the hair and getting rid of my natural waves when used first time.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
      <li>would highly recommend it</li>
      <li>Made hair soft and straight</li>
      <li>I did try it one more time, but still no real change in my hair, so I&#x27;ve gone back to argon oil, which does work..</li>
      <li>Dried hair become more alive.</li>
      <li>, madey hair feel very soft and</li>
      <li>My hair felt okay after use, not more manageable than otherwise.</li>
      <li>its not a waste of money!</li>
      <li>Since this product isn&#x27;t completely organic I will not be repurchasing or trying it again.</li>
      <li>but my hair is so so soft &amp; shiny .</li>
      <li>My hair is so soft and silky after using this masque.</li>
      <li>I coated my dry hair in the masque and it stayed SUPER soft through several washes!</li>
      <li>&amp; my hair instantly got soft &amp; shiny!</li>
      <li>I have virgin African American hair which is naturally an afro.</li>
      <li>For regular dry hair, find a mask that does not include protein, and instead mainly oils and conditioners.</li>
      <li>Keratin is a protein, so if you already have a regular amount of protein in your hair, adding more will actually make your hair worse.</li>
      <li>I like the thin oils much better after I blow dry</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair, which was disappointing. As a keratin masque I expected at least some results - none whatsoever, though.</li>
    <li> It made my hair feel like straw and a devil to get tangles out while blow drying! It took me a week of deep conditioning with my favorite conditioner, Dove, to get it soft again.  I will not be using again!  Their keratin spray instant repair is the BOMB though.  I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> Very nice masque I love it, madey hair feel very soft and healthy would buy again from this supplier.</li>
    <li> Worked wonders in smoothing out the hair and getting rid of my natural waves when used first time. Strangely, didnt work the same way afterwards..</li>
    <li> Best deep conditioner have ever hair specialist made ..cant live with out it ..sincerly</li>
    <li> Naturally, long curly hair necessity!</li>
    <li> The best products!! amazing price and they do work! I have purchased lots of Organix products and they are all incredible! and the smell is just amazing as well!</li>
    <li> Masks for hair thick, perfectly nourishes volosy.Posle use good comb. Dried hair become more alive. Recommend the use of a complex with shampoo.</li>
    <li> My hair felt okay after use, not more manageable than otherwise. It was worth a try, I have fine 4C hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product prior to this purchase but was having difficulty finding it. I love the way my un-rulely hair responds to it. If you have wavey, frizzy, un- rulely hair ( and you know what I mean!) - I think you&#x27;ll agree!</li>
    <li> I was expecting a bigger size, didn&#x27;t realized  that it was a very small hair cream . I haven&#x27;t try yet but smells really nice.</li>
    <li> I use this masque in the ends of my hair every 2-3 days. It smells wonderful and leaves my hair soft and shiny. It has also helped reduce the amount of split ends I get from flat ironing my hair. This is a quality product at a reasonable price. It works just as well as its much more expensive salon counterparts!</li>
    <li> It is a value for money mask. Not even the expensive ones perform like this. I strongly recommend it even if hair is not keratin treated.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions but didn&#x27;t find that my hair was better hydrated than before.  I did try it one more time, but still no real change in my hair, so I&#x27;ve gone back to argon oil, which does work..</li>
    <li> If you want soft, shiny, healthy and beautiful hair, you must give this a try. I am 63 and my hair looks better now than it ever did.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good stuff and I like it and it has a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT RECOMMEND ME LIKE SO MUCH WITH MY FRIENDS, AMAZON SELLS CUTE THINGS AND GOOD PRICE, I AM VERY SATISFIED</li>
    <li> Its ok but have not seen a true change or difference. Will probably not buy again. I used with the shampoo and its as creamy as expected.</li>
    <li> I use only salon products normally, but this mask is great and I really like it.  I put it in my hair before I go to bed and leave it in there all night.  Next day when I shower and wash my hair, my hair comes out hydrated and silky.  Price is awesome.  Really like this product.  Hydrates without being oily.</li>
    <li> I have virgin African American hair which is naturally an afro. It was awesome! It didn&#x27;t straighten my hair at all really, but it was a bit easier to comb. Additionally, once it dried it was super soft even though it can be kind of brittle without this product. GREAT!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. I take a generous amount &amp; saturate my hair with this once a week. Way more than suggested but my hair is so so soft &amp; shiny . I have hair that I color and its very long. People stop me a lot to comment that they love my hair cause its so shiny and looks so soft which my husband would agree with :). I&#x27;ve used salon products that were very expensive and nothing works like this !!!!! So save your money on all those high priced products!!!!!.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine and most products tend to weigh it down and make it look greasy.  That being said, I need something to keep my frizz in check because I live in what seems like the most humid place in the world!  This masque smells great and keeps my hair soft, silky, and frizz free for days; another great OGX product!</li>
    <li> Just OK. Did not make my hair feel one way or the other. Just another product I spent money on. I like the thin oils much better after I blow dry, just put some on my hands and run it through the dry hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent Masque. It made my hair healthier, smoother and shining. I&#x27;ve tried many masques so far because I have damaged, brittle hair. I could easily say this was one of the best.</li>
    <li> My hair is so soft and silky after using this masque.</li>
    <li> Made hair soft and straight</li>
    <li> I found this stuff to smell like chocolate/coconut.  You actually spread it on your hair (after you have shampooed) and let it sit.  After rinsing, you will notice that your hair has more shine, and seems to be healthier.  I use it twice a week and love it.</li>
    <li> I have not used it long enough to give it a fair rating but my skin feels so good after using it</li>
    <li> Amazing product. i did a keratin treatment and using this product to keep it straight.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff ever.  I have yet to be disappointed with any of the Organix care line.&lt;br /&gt;Shipment was good - and the product works wonders for my rough dry hair....I mean miracles.  It smells so good, you&#x27;ll want to eat it...lol</li>
    <li> this makes your hair feel amazing</li>
    <li> I was really excited once I got this in the mail. I immediately opened it up and loved the smell. Once I decided to use it I put a little bit in my hair and let it sit for about 10 mins since my hair isn&#x27;t that long nor doesn&#x27;t need as long for the product to penetrate it. When I washed it out my hair was somewhat soft and some of my curls had loosen up a bit but nothing fantastic. Once my hair dried it was hard and tangled and definitely not soft. I was unhappy. Then I went online to see other reviews and notice I wasn&#x27;t the only one. Since this product isn&#x27;t completely organic I will not be repurchasing or trying it again. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone with dry, frizzy, and curly hair like mine. It&#x27;s just not the right product.</li>
    <li> It left my hair stringy and  tangled. Not at all what I was going for. There was no strength gained at all.</li>
    <li> It smells nice, but didn&#x27;t really help my hair. I&#x27;ve actually noticed my hair was starting to get shorter and shorter on the sides. It&#x27;s been about 5-6 months since I stopped using it and my hair has grown back to match the rest of my hair. So basically, use this if you want nice smelling hair and nothing else.</li>
    <li> im giving this a 5 for two reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1. it came in soo fast! i got it in 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;2. it really works, i used it right away &amp; my hair instantly got soft &amp; shiny! its not a waste of money! its worth it 100%.</li>
    <li> For those who have had problems with their hair being stringy or straw-like after use, there is a reason for that. After bleaching my hair multiple times, my hairdresser told me that I needed a product that would add protein to my damaged hair. Keratin is a protein, so if you already have a regular amount of protein in your hair, adding more will actually make your hair worse. For regular dry hair, find a mask that does not include protein, and instead mainly oils and conditioners. If your hair is severely bleached or damaged from dyes, then adding a protein will improve the condition of your hair, if used in moderation.</li>
    <li> So far, not impressed. Trying to find something that relaxes the frizz and calms my hair. I use the shampoo and conditioner of this brand religiously and it&#x27;s pretty awesome. However, I thought by paying this much for this product and it having reasonable reviews, this may be better than the conditioner itself. I don&#x27;t find it anywhere near as good as the standard conditioner. And this is double the price. I have only used it twice now, so will continue to use it and see how it goes, but my first 2 uses haven&#x27;t been great to be honest.</li>
    <li> I have very processed, bleach blonde-white hair that is so hard to work with. I coated my dry hair in the masque and it stayed SUPER soft through several washes! Made my hair very manageable and silky. Good price but the product is a bit smaller than I imagined.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a fantastic product I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a product that leaves your hair healthy manageable silky soft looking .&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it I use it faithfully and I would definitely continue to buy this product over and over again.</li>
    <li> AN EXCELLENT &amp; VERY EFFECTIVE FOR ME HAIR CONDITIONING PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Excellent product , I recommend 100%</li>
    <li> This product gets my vote for frizz control</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS!!! I have NOT taken care of my hair the way I should in my 39 years. Now I&#x27;m trying to take care of it better and don&#x27;t know really what to use on my hair. ( I am African American with REALLY thick what people call 4C hair). this Masque is AMAZING! My hair is sooo soft and hydrated.it FEELS healthy. Not just look... it holds a curl and is just wonderful. My little girls (11 and 12) its awesome on there hair too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has an amazing scent as well... and it doesn&#x27;t have that she sprayed on too much jordache scent.... anyone that was young in the 80&#x27;s knows what I mean! LOL</li>
