      <li>Not only is the size perfect for my head and veil, the surface area of the top part of the comb is ideal for embellishing.  </li>
      <li>I was expecting (maybe at my own fault) that being \\&quot;interlocking\\&quot; there would be 2 for the price.</li>

      <li>I LOVE TO WEAR MY HAIR UP, AND THESE SUPPORT THEM</li>
      <li>It better be a pack of two and the color I ordered</li>
      <li>Make sure you order 2 they don&#x27;t come as a pair.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
      <li>I love this comb</li>
      <li>Again, I love these combs</li>
      <li>So glad to find them.  </li>
      <li>I easily glued a piece of felt to it and then added silk flowers and Swarovski crystals.  </li>
      <li>But they do work just fine.</li>
      <li>and I was so happy I finally found them.</li>
      <li>I awaited it excitedly.</li>
      <li>As someone who sought out this product relentlessly at pharmacies and beauty boutiques...I was excited to find it here.</li>
      <li>Yes, it does have to be replaced as time goes on because I use it so much!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so pleased that I&#x27;m planning to order more combs to embellish for everyday wear and to sell (embellished, of course!)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like a mini crown, which was exactly the effect I wanted.  </li>
      <li>I am looking for something a little different but this comb is just great.</li>
      <li>I have really missed these combs.  </li>
      <li>They hold my hair really well.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much.</li>
      <li>They hold my hair really snug.  </li>
      <li>Work great and hold well, but cost is a little too high, so only four stars.</li>
      <li>These are more flexible than the others offered, the teeth break easily on the hard plastic type, so this flexible plastic will last much longer.</li>
      <li>I have used this particular product for over 15 years.  </li>
      <li>When I found this product on Amazon, I had high hopes.  </li>
      <li>Pretty smart now they are making double the money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I searched high and low for a large, curved tortoise shell comb that I could embellish and place in front of my veil for my upcoming wedding.  </li>
      <li>I am frequently having to redo the locking of the combs.  </li>
      <li>If you hair is thin or fine, it may not hold it up at all.....</li>

<li> I am frequently having to redo the locking of the combs.  </li>
<li> If you hair is thin or fine, it may not hold it up at all.....</li>
<li> My hair is long in the front and short in the back (think Katie Holmes</li>
<li> It was advertised as being 7 1/4 inches, but they were actually 6 inches long.  </li>
<li> They probably won&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
<li> My hair is long with medium thickness.  </li>
<li> Also, the two combs do not stay locked together for long.  </li>
<li> This allows me to keep my long curls, away from the face, and still look chic!  </li>
<li> I have been looking for these interlocking hair combs for a very long time.  </li>
<li> No small feat since I have thick hair.</li>
<li> To my disappointment, I opened this box filled with packing peanuts to find a single comb.</li>
<li> and these combs do the trick because they are longer than other interlocking combs I have purchased from Amazon.</li>
<li> In all fairness, I did call the company, and they did reimburse half of the purchase price.</li>
<li> It also came as a black comb, not \\&quot;Tortoise Clear\\&quot;</li>
<li> I think the negative reviews came from skinny-haired people so these combs just fell right out and went through their sad hair and onto the ground.  </li>
<li> They are made from plastic that is just a little too brittle for my taste.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have to use bobby pins to hold the stray pieces up because these combs are long enough to catch those annoying loose ends.  </li>
<li> I HAVE THICK WAVY/CURLY HAIR, AND THESE COMBS HOLD MY HAIR TIGHTLY.  </li>
<li> Some idiot (to us consumers) figured out you could pull one side of your hair back by using it as you would any other comb.</li>
<li> Amazon, this is not a good seller for you to be associated with.  </li>
<li> I was disappointed in this product.  </li>
<li> I was very disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ordered this interlocking tortoise comb pack of two on May 13 2009. today is May 26, 2009 and I finally got an email that it was shipped.  12 days to ship.  I know someone who has an on line ebay business and if took 12 days to ship a product he&#x27;d be out of business.  I hope to have this tomorrow as it&#x27;s in transit. It better be a pack of two and the color I ordered or I&#x27;m going to hit the roof.  Amazon, this is not a good seller for you to be associated with.  I&#x27;ll be back writing another review it the product is not what I ordered.</li>
    <li> I too searched for these combs for several years.  I just happened upon this sight and read the review.  Now you do have to order 2 combs because they do not come as a pair and I did get the tortoise color.  I love this comb, I don&#x27;t understand why you can&#x27;t find it in the stores.  Thank You!</li>
    <li> These combs are great.  They hold my hair really snug.  My hair is long with medium thickness.  I totally recommend this item.</li>
    <li> and made for \\&quot;alot of hair\\&quot;! If you hair is thin or fine, it may not hold it up at all.....they are nice, but they keep \\&quot;slipping\\&quot;</li>
    <li> As someone who sought out this product relentlessly at pharmacies and beauty boutiques...I was excited to find it here. I had a pair of interlocking combs I paid $5.00 for back in the 90&#x27;s. I was expecting (maybe at my own fault) that being \\&quot;interlocking\\&quot; there would be 2 for the price. I awaited it excitedly. To my disappointment, I opened this box filled with packing peanuts to find a single comb. I can not \\&quot;interlock\\&quot; 1 comb. I was very disappointed. Oh yea...It also came as a black comb, not \\&quot;Tortoise Clear\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I have really missed these combs.  So glad to find them.  These are not quite perfect.  They are made from plastic that is just a little too brittle for my taste.  They probably won&#x27;t last very long.  But they do work just fine.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for these interlocking hair combs for a very long time.  They are strong and hold the hair in an amazing way!  I was extremely happy when I found them.  I don&#x27;t like short hair, but I don&#x27;t like the hair on my face either.  This allows me to keep my long curls, away from the face, and still look chic!  Terrific!!  I love them!!</li>
    <li> My hair is long in the front and short in the back (think Katie Holmes famous bob-look).  I like to wear my hair up and these combs do the trick because they are longer than other interlocking combs I have purchased from Amazon. I don&#x27;t have to use bobby pins to hold the stray pieces up because these combs are long enough to catch those annoying loose ends.  Just bought some more!</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have used this particular product for over 15 years.  Yes, it does have to be replaced as time goes on because I use it so much!  You can also throw it in the dishwasher for cleaning.</li>
    <li> I loooooove these hair products!! I&#x27;ve looked for years and I was so happy I finally found them. They hold my hair really well. No small feat since I have thick hair. I think the negative reviews came from skinny-haired people so these combs just fell right out and went through their sad hair and onto the ground.  Again, I love these combs</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  I HAVE THICK WAVY/CURLY HAIR, AND THESE COMBS HOLD MY HAIR TIGHTLY.  I LOVE TO WEAR MY HAIR UP, AND THESE SUPPORT THEM WELL.  I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR ANOTHER PAIR OF COMBS FOR YEARS, AND FINALLY FOUND THESE.  THEY COME IN A PAIR, AND I LOVE THE COLOR.  THE SERVICE WAS GREAT.  I GIVE IT A FIVE STAR RATING!!!  THE PRICE IS GREAT....DON&#x27;T BOTHER LOOKING FURTHER....BUY THESE!</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a set of interlocking combs for months, having gotten rid of a number of them about 15 years ago when I switched to very short hair.  The comb set gives me another option when it comes to styling/wearing my hair.      The product was received within a week of ordering, and I was very impressed with the speed they handled the order.  The combs are sturdy and the tortoiseshell look is stylish.</li>
    <li> Purchased to replace a set that someone stepped on.  Works just as great as what I was replacing.</li>
    <li> I am looking for something a little different but this comb is just great. I use it just about every day.</li>
    <li> I searched high and low for a large, curved tortoise shell comb that I could embellish and place in front of my veil for my upcoming wedding.  When I found this product on Amazon, I had high hopes.  And when it arrived in the mail, those hopes were surpassed!  Not only is the size perfect for my head and veil, the surface area of the top part of the comb is ideal for embellishing.  I easily glued a piece of felt to it and then added silk flowers and Swarovski crystals.  It turned out beautifully and is very durable.  It&#x27;s like a mini crown, which was exactly the effect I wanted.  I&#x27;m so pleased that I&#x27;m planning to order more combs to embellish for everyday wear and to sell (embellished, of course!) in my Etsy shop.</li>
    <li> Work great and hold well, but cost is a little too high, so only four stars.</li>
    <li> I love these combs. I looked for years to find them again.Make sure you order 2 they don&#x27;t come as a pair. I missed having them. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this product.  It was advertised as being 7 1/4 inches, but they were actually 6 inches long.  Also, the two combs do not stay locked together for long.  I am frequently having to redo the locking of the combs.  In all fairness, I did call the company, and they did reimburse half of the purchase price.</li>
    <li> You have to buy 2!! Some idiot (to us consumers) figured out you could pull one side of your hair back by using it as you would any other comb. Pull hair back w/one comb and reverse direction to lock in place. But if you want to pull back both sides as in a ponytail, it takes 2. Pretty smart now they are making double the money.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this PAIR (that&#x27;s how it came) maybe 2 years ago, from Amazon. I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. I used these 30-35 years ago when you could find them at the drug stores, as a pair then too of course. These are more flexible than the others offered, the teeth break easily on the hard plastic type, so this flexible plastic will last much longer.</li>
