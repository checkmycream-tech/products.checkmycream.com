      <li>The blade alignment is perfect, and better than on my 34c.  </li>

      <li>Razor is fine , does a good job , not</li>
      <li>Wow, it&#x27;s great!</li>
      <li>It is by far the best razor I have ever owned.</li>
      <li>far NONE has come close to a perfect shave.</li>
      <li>Old school and a great shave!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t grow beards, but they grow quickly so this razor is great for me because the blades are cheap but effective and that&#x27;s</li>
      <li>The many reasons this thing is great are true: cheap blades, well made, close shave</li>
      <li>I would love it even more if it was heavier.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
      <li>I am sure as I get used to it</li>
      <li>Been using this razor for a while now and have grown to love it.  </li>
      <li>However, I have discovered I need a more &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; razor for my tougher beard.</li>
      <li>The blade is slightly more exposed.</li>
      <li>&quot; (more like scraping than shaving)</li>
      <li>Glad I switched.</li>
      <li>This razor is fantastic!  </li>
      <li>I am very happy with this combination and the shave it gives with the Gillett Silver Blue blade</li>
      <li>Okay ladies out there, I&#x27;m speaking to you.  </li>
      <li>my favorite razor, love the longer handle, I don&#x27;t like the shorter handle razors for some reason, just got used to longer handles</li>
      <li>As a recent convert to the world of Safety Razors, I am extremely impressed with the merkur&#x27;s design and ease of shave...</li>
      <li>me sometime top decide after reading reviews till I couldn&#x27;t see</li>
      <li>Im sure</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>my shaves will get better.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am super super happy with my purchase and one day</li>
      <li>I used to think that my Gillette Fusion 5 blade or Schick Hydro was the best ever, but neither of these can compare to the shave you get with this razor with pretty much any titanium blade.  </li>
      <li>there are more agressive razors out there for the advanced but</li>
      <li>I can easily go through two or three so-called quality, name brand disposable razors.</li>
      <li>razor was so easy to get used to.</li>
      <li>It easily cuts neck hairs without any clogging.</li>
      <li>just what I thought it would be bur, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s much easier to use and effective....</li>

      <li>My wife noticed my face is now baby smooth.  </li>
      <li>This is one of the most useful shavers I have ever owned.</li>
      <li>Using a razor with a comb guard is fantastic because it never gets clogged.</li>
      <li>personally it&#x27;s a more satisfying shave (I highly recommend this item as well)&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll not quote my father&#x27;s response, as this is a family friendly site.</li>
      <li>It is a nice razor and a good introduction to modern DE or safety razor open comb razors</li>
      <li>For comparison I think the new Goodfella  and the vintage Gillette NEW are perfect for me, with the Gillette Old a bit more aggressive than I like.</li>
      <li>It is definitely more aggressive than the old Gillette, and gets to the top lip hairs under my nose that the Gillette couldn&#x27;t reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the area clean of hair, so it irritates the hair follicles and your skin while still leaving blotches of hair on it...</li>

      <li>This razor&#x27;s head alignment and/or positioning of the blade results in this most comfortable and smooth I have ever had by far.  </li>
      <li>This razor is solidly built and you can get a good shave from it</li>
      <li>i will look into getting a full set (Razor, shaving bowl, brush and stand)</li>
      <li>/&gt;It came with a blade that I didn&#x27;t especially care for, but with the Personna blades it gave a nice smooth shave.  </li>

      <li>The shaves have been exceedingly mild, with zero burn/</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was a nice bonus that the threads on the Merkur and Gillette both matched, so that I could use either head with the Merkur&#x27;s long, comfortable handle, if I needed to.&lt;br</li>

      <li>think my ideal razor is starting to present itself to me.  </li>
      <li>It is has completely changed the way I shave, and I love</li>
      <li>One giving a nice shave in the Merkur would be totally ineffective in the Gillette.</li>

      <li>I have difficulty getting the razor to expose just the right amount of blade.</li>
      <li>Good old German engineering.</li>
      <li>they will find the exact right equipment on the first go-round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like the screw in handle and solid top rather than the butterfly opening razors, this one holds the blade in place,</li>
      <li>or even most people- might not necessarily work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;ve used it with Merkur and Feather blades, and it is smooth as silk with both.</li>

    <li> I have difficulty getting the razor to expose just the right amount of blade. I&#x27;ve been using a safety razor for years, and never had trouble with any of them before. I am disappointed!</li>
    <li> Very well made razor. Gives a great close shave.</li>
    <li> This is one of the most useful shavers I have ever owned. The handle is longer just the way I like it. Heavy chrome will last a life time. Good old German engineering. Love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent! You need to be more careful with this than with the closed comb version. The blade is slightly more exposed. This also makes your average shave a bit closer.</li>
    <li> Great razor!  Old school and a great shave!</li>
    <li> This razor without guard is sensational for beard trimming. It easily cuts neck hairs without any clogging. By contrast, conventional razors rapidly clog making them substantially worthless in short order. I have wasted far too many years throwing all manner of razors away before learning this. This review relates to model: Merkur Safety Razor #25c, long without guard.</li>
    <li> Okay ladies out there, I&#x27;m speaking to you.  These aren&#x27;t only for guys anymore. I will not pay hard earned money on rediculously high priced pieces of plastic, silly lubricating strip with single, double, triple or quadruple semi-sharp blades made in Vietnam, Taiwan, China, Mexico or any third world country!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate shaving! Unlike many women, I  must shave daily, otherwise, I&#x27;d need to drag the string trimmer and blower into the bathroom. My legs are long and extremely difficult to shave.  I can easily go through two or three so-called quality, name brand disposable razors. I even use men&#x27;s disposable razors with half a can of Barbasol. Now you know why I hate shaving.  When I began shaving, I would sneak my father&#x27;s butterfly razor into the shower.  I&#x27;ll not quote my father&#x27;s response, as this is a family friendly site. I&#x27;ll only say, he was not happy when he began shaving with a dull blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try both a butterfly and a three piece double edge razor.  This razor is fantastic!  Add Feather double edge blades, and you&#x27;ll be amazed at the results.  You will effortlessly remove the dreaded stubble for a fraction of the cost of disposable razors. You can purchase large quantities of blades for very little cost here on Amazon, or in ebay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is absolutely no reason to fear shaving with a double edge razor and Feather or, any other quality double edge blade. You have everything to gain, and nothing to lose.</li>
    <li> Shaving is the men&#x27;s version of women&#x27;s cosmetics - completely overpriced. I got fed up with the ridiculous cost of disposable replacement heads for expensive plastic handles. I researched other options and found this Merkur razor. Wow, it&#x27;s great! It seems scary at first but it handles like a dream and works just as well, if not better, as all of those quintuplet-bladed super-duper-maxo-plastico razors. Yes, the original cost of this handle is quite a bit more but the cost savings for the blades is ridiculously cheaper. I figure that I will pay for this thing within three months with the savings from the blade purchases. After that, it&#x27;s all gravy. Next round is on me! Cheers.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving my entire head since 1979.  The switch back to this type of razor has been a revelation.  I get a closer shave with no irritation.  The blades are less expensive and last longer than the common multi-blade cartridges.  The simplicity of this razor&#x27;s design is wonderful.</li>
    <li> As a young whipper snapper (22 years old) I have been shaving for the past couple years with an electric shaver because I hated paying for god expensive razors. One day I saw a commercial that Rick Harrision from Pawn Stars and saw the double edge razor. I had known of them but I never really looked into getting one. After doing some research and watching some videos I went ahead and bought this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first shave went by very well I must say. Only a couple cuts but nothing super big or deep. I am sure as I get used to it my shaves will get better. I don&#x27;t grow beards, but they grow quickly so this razor is great for me because the blades are cheap but effective and that&#x27;s the key.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried using a brush and shaving soap. I bought the Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set (Soap, Bowl, Brush) as an add on item and I can say this is the way to have. It&#x27;s old school and to me personally it&#x27;s a more satisfying shave (I highly recommend this item as well)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am super super happy with my purchase and one day i will look into getting a full set (Razor, shaving bowl, brush and stand) one day soon.</li>
    <li> my husband loves this razor</li>
    <li> I have tried all the latest and greatest (?) razors available.&lt;br /&gt;So far NONE has come close to a perfect shave. My beard goes every which way!&lt;br /&gt;I have the long handle with comb guard, the regular type guard could not get close enough.&lt;br /&gt;This one is as close to perfect as I could hope to get.&lt;br /&gt;And after learning on the basic Feather razor, I found switching to this no problem.&lt;br /&gt;No nicks or cuts (YES I&#x27;ve been using this awhile!) and a great shave every time!&lt;br /&gt;Took me sometime top decide after reading reviews till I couldn&#x27;t see straight.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy I decided on this one.</li>
    <li> These reviews here at Amazon is covering all THREE models.&lt;br /&gt;My review is for the Long Handle with Comb Guard.&lt;br /&gt;The head for this razor is much smaller than the other two listed here.&lt;br /&gt;With this razor, I am able to shave under my nose since it has less bulk.</li>
    <li> Razor is fine , does a good job , not just what I thought it would be bur, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> A great razor. I bought the short one, and then I bought the long one. Always buy the long one. Also buy their razor blades.</li>
    <li> Nice razor. Just wished it opened butterfly style. I actually have to unscrew the whole top off take it apart to change razor. Could be dangerous. Did not say that it the write up on it.&lt;br /&gt;Frank</li>
    <li> As a recent convert to the world of Safety Razors, I am extremely impressed with the merkur&#x27;s design and ease of shave...I&#x27;ve gotten back to my pre-safety razor speed of shave with minimal blood loss.  I wish the Merkur&#x27;s handle was slightly longer for grip...but ultimately very pleased and will no longer be raped by Gillette and the like.  I paired this with some Israeli Personnas.</li>
    <li> Great razor !!!  I like the feel and the weight of it. Give me a great shave with this razor.</li>
    <li> The rule of thumb with any sort of alternative shaving method (straight razor, double-edge safety razor, etc) is YOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Choosing the right shaving equipment is a very personal decision.  Everyone&#x27;s face and skin are different, and what works really well for one person- or even most people- might not necessarily work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if the reviews are overwhelmingly positive, one needs to know going in that its unlikely they will find the exact right equipment on the first go-round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead let the reviews guide you toward which equipment is /well-made/, then go from there in finding what works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Backgound--&lt;br /&gt;I discovered DE (double edge) safety razor shaving after looking for a cheaper alternative to traditional cartridge razors.  While they always gave me a nice clean shave, I always hated having to drop $4 per cartridge only to have it dull after a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While helping a good friend clean out his grandfather&#x27;s garage, I discovered a 1940&#x27;s era Gillette razor in basically unused condition.  He let me keep it.  I took it home, and cleaned it to a nice shine.  I then went and bought some Personna blades from the local Walgreens, and off I went.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I found the handle on the Gillette too short for my liking, and combined with its weight made my fingers cramp.  The combination of blade+razor also did shave as close as I would have liked.  So I ordered some Feather blades (based off good reviews) as well a sampler package of different blades (definitely go this route starting out)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then went and ordered this.  I was initially on the fence about going with an open comb or with a guard.  But I figured if I didn&#x27;t like the open comb, I could always go back to the old Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--The Product--&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the package, I was really impressed.  Its a really beautiful looking tool.  It feels heavy enough to be substantial but light enough to be deft in one&#x27;s hands.  The finish work is really wonderful, and it looks and feels every bit the German-made tool that it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with a blade that I didn&#x27;t especially care for, but with the Personna blades it gave a nice smooth shave.  It is definitely more aggressive than the old Gillette, and gets to the top lip hairs under my nose that the Gillette couldn&#x27;t reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--On Blades--&lt;br /&gt;When I finally received the Feathers and Sampler pack, I found that different blades were picky about which of the two razors I used.  One giving a nice shave in the Merkur would be totally ineffective in the Gillette. (like the Personna)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or the reverse: one in the Gillette might give a smooth, comfortable shave but when in the Merkur would shred your face to a bloody mess. (the Feather was the worst offender, but could be controlled with a bit of practice)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a nice bonus that the threads on the Merkur and Gillette both matched, so that I could use either head with the Merkur&#x27;s long, comfortable handle, if I needed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end I found that I generally preferred the Merkur.  I also found that- much to my immense chagrin- the blades that paired best with it, lasted longest, and gave by fair the best shave, were the Gillettes I so wanted to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Conclusion--&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;ve said, you really can&#x27;t go off rating alone when purchasing shaving gear, so I&#x27;ve tried to relay as much about my own experiences as possible to help you make an informed decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only piece of advice: if you don&#x27;t already have a safety razor, you might want to start on one with a guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you&#x27;ve got the technique down, you can get a more aggressive one if you decide you really need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in the end this is just me, and my advice will only get you so far.one&#x27;s hands.

    <li> I always wanted a good safety razor after trying all the razors with 3 to 4 blades. This was one of the highest rated handles and It meets all my expectations.</li>
    <li> Well crafted, as you would expect from Germany. However, I have discovered I need a more &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; razor for my tougher beard. I&#x27;ll keep this one for when my senior, cat-whiskers days arrive! Would buy again, and will.</li>
    <li> This razor is solidly built and you can get a good shave from it but it&#x27;s not going to give you a very close shave.  the comb edges give it and almost idiot proof shave.I like using it when I&#x27;m in a hurry and I can just run it over my face as fast as I want with no worries about any cuts.</li>
    <li> Solid and reliable, Simple and clean</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe people still use these types of razors. Horrible.</li>
    <li> My razor was actually pretty nice especially compared to Merkur&#x27;s usual quality control with no finish issues or burs. It is a nice razor and a good introduction to modern DE or safety razor open comb razors but I find it a little mild. For comparison I think the new Goodfella  and the vintage Gillette NEW are perfect for me, with the Gillette Old a bit more aggressive than I like.</li>
    <li> Sturdy construction. Butterfly opening would have been better, but it works great nonetheless and I&#x27;m saving a fortune by not having to buy disposable razors.</li>
    <li> The many reasons this thing is great are true: cheap blades, well made, close shave if you do it right, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However there are couple things I really don&#x27;t like about this razor:&lt;br /&gt;1) I shave my head every day. It&#x27;s really tough to maintain the correct angle right on the back of my head even after a few months practice.&lt;br /&gt;2) I hate the three piece holder when changing the blades. It&#x27;s one more hassle when you&#x27;re holding a sharp blade to try to screw three things together with only two hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth a shot... If you&#x27;re cartridge user consider that you can buy this thing and a couple packs of razors for the same price as you&#x27;d pay for 8-10 gillette super-fancy refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I&#x27;ve tried every option on the market: electric, cartridges, and DE razors. I&#x27;m disappointed with the results here and will be going back to Dorco cartridges.</li>
    <li> Why didn&#x27;t I start using this sooner.  This does a better shave at a fraction of the cost of those gimickey Mach Turbo Fusion super expensive multi-blade razors with that silly moisture strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For moisture, I use O&#x27;lay body wash instead of shaving cream.  My girlfriend thinks I have the smoothest skin and I never get razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor was so easy to get used to.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. Glad I switched. I just got my 1st 100 pack of blades. I&#x27;m done with disposables.</li>
    <li> Awesome razor. If you do it correctly you will NOT cut your jugular open and bleed out in front of your friends. The irrational fear I had before I used this was based solely on me cutting my jugular open and killing myself because these things carry a stigma - and its very wrong. Razor blades are indeed sharp, just don&#x27;t be an idiot and cut your jugular open with them.</li>
    <li> I was under the impression I ordered the one without guides, Also a blde was to be included but received an empty package,</li>
    <li> Great Razor. Well balanced, substantial, feels good in your hand. So far I&#x27;ve used it with Merkur and Feather blades, and it is smooth as silk with both.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Safety razors since I&#x27;ve switched a few years ago. I have a heavy beard and shave maybe once a week. Using a razor with a comb guard is fantastic because it never gets clogged. I would love it even more if it was heavier. You won&#x27;t cut yourself so don&#x27;t hesitate</li>
    <li> The handle is slightly longer than HD Classic 34C and EJ89.  the handle diameter is slightly narrower.  The blade alignment is perfect, and better than on my 34c.  the blade exposure is also small, with a small gap between the open comb bottom plate and top plate.&lt;br /&gt;This shaves mild vs my other two razors.  the open comb design allows the soap/cream to stay on the skin as the blade passes.  It also has a milder blade angle due to smaller blade exposure.  It is also lighter than the 34c and EJ89, forcing you to keep a lighter touch with your hand.  The shaves have been exceedingly mild, with zero burn/irritation.&lt;br /&gt;I should have started using this razor when I began shaving with DE blades.  It is FAR milder and less intimidating than 34c, which is the razor everyone recommends to start with, on forums, and here on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I much prefer this razor on xtg and atg passes, but prefer using 34c and EJ for WTG.&lt;br /&gt;I think my ideal razor is starting to present itself to me.  I want machined stainless steel, like a feather or Icon, open comb design, with slightly more blade exposure than this.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to wet shaving, I cannot imagine a better starter razor.  This is the one I will recommend from now on.  If you ever purhcase a DE razor retail (at AOS) in a mall, you&#x27;re a fool</li>
    <li> It does it&#x27;s job without fanfare, vibrating, or swivel heads. It&#x27;s a great razor for the money that you won&#x27;t need to replace until you want to.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t shave clean, it irritates the skin and worse it leaves the patch of skin you&#x27;re attempting to shave in pain because you&#x27;re trying so hard to \\&quot;scrape\\&quot; (more like scraping than shaving) the area clean of hair, so it irritates the hair follicles and your skin while still leaving blotches of hair on it... should&#x27;ve just stayed with a gillette or braun shaver that&#x27;s much easier to use and effective.... in 1 to 3 seconds you&#x27;re done... as opposed to this.. which u run it through over and over again... and nothing gets removed and  you&#x27;re left with pain -- not worth it in my opinion</li>
    <li> I started shaving with Straight razors and safety razors about 3 years ago.  This razor&#x27;s head alignment and/or positioning of the blade results in this most comfortable and smooth I have ever had by far.  I can&#x27;t stress enough that this is the best razor due to it&#x27;s  head alignment and/or positioning of the blade.  I tried other safety razors and they were horrible!  Gashed my head up pretty bad.  This razor&#x27;s head alignment and/or positioning of the blade results in almost never nicking myself.  I love this razor! I used to think that my Gillette Fusion 5 blade or Schick Hydro was the best ever, but neither of these can compare to the shave you get with this razor with pretty much any titanium blade.  I shave my entire head every two days and I never have any major irritation.  I always had irritation when using the disposable cartridges.  I hope this helps anyone who is on the fence about using safety razors or this specific razor.</li>
    <li> Great product, great value.</li>
    <li> Yo-    I bought the long handle version with the open comb guard.  I am very happy with this combination and the shave it gives with the Gillett Silver Blue blade is nothing short of fantastic - not a single nick going both down and up!!  No irritation at all.    I have the Parker 99R, Feather, Gillette and a cheapo DE and this one is the best one yet!!!    Recommend A+++++</li>
    <li> I was tired of paying $20 for four Gillette cartridges and though they were quick and easy to use, they never gave a great shave.  I paired this Merkur up with Feather blades and clumsily gave it try.  It take some practice, but it won&#x27;t take long to learn how to use a safety razor.  In no time I was getting the smoothest shave ever.  My wife noticed my face is now baby smooth.  The closer shave looks great all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased a good quality badger brush, a bowl of shaving cream, and some aftershave.  Check out the Taylor of Old Bond Street products. I really like them.  Also check into an alum bar.  I wish I had known all about these products long ago.</li>
    <li> my favorite razor, love the longer handle, I don&#x27;t like the shorter handle razors for some reason, just got used to longer handles I guess, I&#x27;m 5&#x27;10&amp;#34; so not like I&#x27;m a 7&#x27; giant.  I was a little surprised at the rake edge that goes across the face, my other razors are flat edge all the way under the blade edge, don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s designed that way, perhaps to allow closer shave, which it does do.  You can feel the rake tips going over the skin, but it&#x27;s not a problem.  I like the screw in handle and solid top rather than the butterfly opening razors, this one holds the blade in place, very few moving parts, easy to clean, no hinges to get gunked up, just my preference.</li>
    <li> I needed a safety razor with a longer handle. This fits my hands perfect and makes my shaving passes much smoother. I can not attest to the longer term, yet, of this item. But if other merkur reviews are true, I expect it to hold up well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for a year now. It is has completely changed the way I shave, and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I use Poraso soaps, a boars hair brush, and any aftershave I care for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even take it traveling with me. It is by far the best razor I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> Been using this razor for a while now and have grown to love it.  Im sure there are more agressive razors out there for the advanced but as a entry level DE saftey razor you can&#x27;t go wrong with buying this.</li>
