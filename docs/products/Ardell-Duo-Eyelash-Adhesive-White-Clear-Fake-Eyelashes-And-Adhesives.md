<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> All right with the the purchase and delivery.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! I&#x27;m a beginner false eyelash wearer, and I tried applying falsies multiple times using the glue that comes with them. Nope! That stuff DOES NOT WORK. So I looked online for what kind I should order, a lot of people suggest Duo and it&#x27;s very cheap, so this is what I ordered! The first time I tried using THIS glue instead of the included glue was the first time I ever got them to apply correctly and look good on me! It worked great, my eyelashes never felt like they were falling off, and I found it even easier to use than the stuff that came with. Couldn&#x27;t recommend this more highly!</li>
    <li> Smells like fish, but does the job wonderfully. The smell goes away once it&#x27;s dry and it worked really well!</li>
    <li> Duo is a really good lash adhesive. I wear lashes multiple times a week and my tube of dark tone Duo has lasted me a very long time with great results. I was very disappointed when I received the Clear tone duo because it was extremely runny and did not do a good job of keeping my lashes on, especially if it is hot. My dark tone Duo is a great consistency and keeps my lashes on even while sweating. The clear tone formula is awful so if looking for a good lash adhesive, the the Duo dark tone.</li>
    <li> It has a horrible smell to it and takes to long to stick on.</li>
    <li> Dries white alone or whatever color foundation/ eye makeup you are using. Does not really stick and peels off very easily.</li>
    <li> It is white not clear.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best eye-lash glues I have ever used.  These dry pretty quickly, and they dry clear. They do not sting my eye, unlike some previous eye-lash glues I used.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best eyelash glue I have ever used. It sticks well and dries very quickly. It bonds quite strongly and comes off easily with make up remover. Be careful not to let it touch water though, it might come loose. But that&#x27;s expected, and other than that,I can&#x27;t really find any other flaw with it.</li>
    <li> Perfect!!! Very easy to use and works fantastically!</li>
    <li> Hands down-best eyelash adhesive on the market. This is the only one I ever use because it works so well. The glue goes on the (false) lashes easily. I usually squeeze a tiny bit out and use a toothpick to apply it to lashes, then let it dry for a minute before applying. It adheres perfectly and removes nicely with no effort, pain or pulling out of real lashes. The glue is easy to remove from your false lashes if you have the type that can be reused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I order Duo from Amazon regularly. I&#x27;ve had shipping issues with this adhesive before but they have always been easily remedied. The glue was sent along with other items and ended up squashed with some leakage. Amazon sent me a new one immediately. I find it easier to order from here than to buy it from Sephora.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so much better than the crappy glue that comes with most lashes.  Dries clear/invisible.  I recommend waiting longer than 30 seconds after applying to lashes before adhering to eyelid (more like 90 seconds).  Ignore the weird smell (it&#x27;s not that strong, and wouldn&#x27;t you rather it worked well than smelled delicious?).</li>
    <li> Great product but postage was very unreasonable. This item weighs 7 grams and is tiny.. how could it cost 8 times the product price!</li>
    <li> dries mostly clear unless you put a gob on</li>
    <li> I used this for false lashes and sticking rhinestones on my face and body.  None of the stones fell off unless they were disturbed by me picking at the stones or unless abrasive contact was made against the stones.</li>
    <li> I love the product but i received it scratched and the top was smashed so the upper  was dry i inserted a needle to reach out the un dry glue.</li>
    <li> I wish I just had more of it!!!!</li>
    <li> Works great. New to false lashes and the glue that came with mine had me so frustrated. With Duo I was able to get the lashes on first try and they stayed on all day. Just wish it didn&#x27;t have formaldehyde in the formula.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this adhesive.</li>
    <li> really like this glue</li>
    <li> I liked this glue but it came a little bit opened already so it wasn&#x27;t full. I was a tad bit upset but other than that it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products out there for fake lashes. a little goes and long way if you put to much it will dry white but it makes putting on lashes a breeze.I love the individual ones which give a very natural look.</li>
    <li> i think im ready to use this product. ive been having it for like a month already. i was just scared. whatever happens happens (:</li>
    <li> I have never put on false eyelashes until my wedding. I ordered this glue because of the fabulous reviews and the reviews were right! It&#x27;s amazing, it goes on so easily and dries clear. Get this glue!!!</li>
    <li> Having a hard time keeping the latches on, I will keep trying it, maybe I&#x27;ll get it right.</li>
    <li> I usually use the Duo black, but a friend of mine introduced the clear to me &amp; I love it! It dries clear &amp; has tremendous holding power!</li>
    <li> Duo is the best lash glue out there, but for some reason the white/clear is not as good as the black. I don&#x27;t really know why, but the black holds way better.</li>
    <li> I really like this glue. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is if you use a little too much glue, then it has more of a white look to it, than a clear look, which makes it look like you have eye crusties or like you didn&#x27;t wash your face or something. But, if you know what you&#x27;re doing and are mindful of how much you use, you should be fine.</li>
    <li> Non irritating, dries quickly and clear, and a little goes a long way. I love wearing my false lashes so much because this product makes it so simple.</li>
    <li> Sorry but this stuff does not hold at all.  I followed the directions and even not getting them wet for 48 hours they will not stay on longer than 2 days, before they start coming off,&amp; I didn&#x27;t even put eye makeup on.</li>
    <li> This really is the stuff!  Although, the selling info states this is waterproof the packaging does not confirm this.</li>
    <li> The glue doesn&#x27;t always want to stick. I have to hold it on for about a minute and a half to make sure it stays on but its manageable and as long as it sticks I&#x27;m fine!</li>
    <li> I ordered this twice. Both times I ordered the waterproof, yet both times received the red-pinkish packaging that was not water proof. I ordered it again thinking perhaps I was careless in my first order &amp; ordered the regular versus waterproof.This did not work any better than the other glues I already have. I have given up on strip lashes. I can&#x27;t apply them easily, all I make is a mess &amp;the glue never seems to dry.</li>
    <li> So, the white...not clear.</li>
    <li> I really can not rate it yet because I haven&#x27;t tried it.  I had ordered both dark and clear, which states they are waterproof; but no where on either package does it say \\&quot;waterproof.\\&quot;  I have contacted customer service about it and they have emailed who they came from to find that out and I have yet to hear from them.  Shouldn&#x27;t it state that it is \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot; on the packaging somewhere?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is why I haven&#x27;t tried it yet to be able to rate either.</li>
    <li> works great, makes gluing on lashes much easier</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive my eyelash adhesive. However, the glue did not work at all like I expected. It just didn&#x27;t seem to get tacky enough to keep the lashes properly stuck to my lash line. They kept sliding off and the ends wouldn&#x27;t stay on very well. I was told that this is one of the best brands of adhesive out there, but I&#x27;m still not very pleased with my experience.  As far as the shipping goes, it was great. Quick and easy!</li>
    <li> Smells funny but does the job. My lashes never fall off. I can shake my head at a rock concert and head bang all I want and my lashes wouldn&#x27;t fall off.</li>
    <li> I would tell people to use this instead because compared to the black adhesive glue. This one wouldn&#x27;t be noticeable if you made a mistake on your eye esp for amateurs like me who is still learning. It comes out white but later it turns glue. Also, I used color eyeliner. I would not want black glue to appear noticeable.</li>
    <li> Love it. Worked as described.</li>
    <li> Great product for your eyes!!!</li>
    <li> I used to work with a make-up artist and this was the only glue she ever used. So this is the only glue I ever use. Is it the best? Honestly, I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;ve never used other brands but I can tell you that it works really well and not to get it on your lashes themselves because it will work too well and may pull some out.</li>
    <li> I have used Duo adhesive since 1976 and it&#x27;s still the best.</li>
    <li> An absolute must have if you plan on wearing eyepashes don&#x27;t know how I went on without them</li>
    <li> Seriously the best glue ever! it comes out a little fast so easy on the squeezing. removing the glue was a nice too no mess</li>
    <li> This purse was advertised as being faux suede and it is nowhere near that. Instead it is faux leather.</li>
    <li> This adhesive works well, but the applicator tube is not very functional- the adhesive comes out in large amounts and way too quickly when squeezing lightly. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> The adhesive becomes less of a brightly- colored, pale white to a slightly translucent, somewhat darker-hued, almost light grey color, but on my brown, slightly-darker than milk chocolate skin, it was a no-go. Had to shelf it and opt for the same product in the dark tone. It blends in well with my eyeliner &amp; mascara, but the main thing is it&#x27;s more forgiving(less obvious) whenever my novice hands/skills get in the way &amp; it gets a lil messy while trying to apply false eyelashes!!</li>
    <li> I love this glue. I personally like the squeezy tube, because you are able to control how much you want to use. I think I might be allergic because it does make my eyes water a little after application, but other than that it is a great product. Also the shipping was fast like always.</li>
    <li> It came right on time, I used it, it works as it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
    <li> Great product and got it really fast.</li>
    <li> White Clear means white, so its not a clear glue :/ everything else is good.</li>
    <li> This glue is totally useless. It is watery and couldn&#x27;t even make a decent paste when I rubbed it between my fingers. I followed the instruction, but to no avail. It was annoying to say the least. Don&#x27;t waste your money on it, seriously!</li>
    <li> Like it in the time excellent</li>
    <li> It really does dry clear.  I am black - with dark brown skin and was worried when I first put it on that you would be able to see it on my skin, but it really does dry clear and is strong and dries faster than other lash glues.</li>
    <li> Was so thick coming out of tube would harldy come out. it was cured inside the tube. So I cut the tube to see. It was all hard. Cheap. For sure.</li>
    <li> If you are going to wear false lashes, there is no other choice for glue. I know some girls i know use the dark stuff but i preffer the clear.</li>
    <li> I had high expectations seeing that this was one of the most revered eyelash glues out there but this was a huge disappointment. I received it today, and the shipping was so quick--a week before it was expected. The glue, however, was watery and no matter how long I waited it would not become tacky and adhere properly:( Other lash glues I&#x27;ve tried have worked fine, so I think I&#x27;ll stick to those brands and not buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is the best lash adhesive I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s reliable and dries clear with no issues.</li>
    <li> Was old when I got it . Not like the same stuff I bought at the store</li>
    <li> Exactly as I expected.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyelash glue I have used. They stay on all day long. It smells like fish but it works amazing. I will use this glue forever</li>
    <li> My wife says great price for all day hold.</li>
    <li> I paid more for shipping than I paid for the product.  I felt the seller could have adjusted the shipping price once he/she realized that only one little item was being shipped, and it could have been mailed through the post office for less than a dollar.</li>
    <li> This is the best glue ever! It goes on white and dry clear... all you have to do is go over the band, once dried, with eyeliner and you have a pretty, natural look. It stays on all day and I have never lost a lash!!! The trick is to put the glue on the lashes and wait about 45 seconds to apply them. This way the glue is sticky and adheres to your eye without sliding around. It&#x27;s the best glue out there!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to used and popular products my friend want to use same me because it&#x27;s same natural not over</li>
    <li> Best eyelash adhesive, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and comes in a nice sized tubes. I love it. Wish Duo came in larger tubes though. It&#x27;s an add on item however so you can&#x27;t buy it by itself which is kind of sad but all in all, worth it &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> I got this to use with my new fake lashes. It is super easy to use. The lashes stay attached all night long, and come off easily when you want them to.</li>
    <li> i gave up on false eyelashes because i never had any luck with the adhesives.  i tried doing it myself (using shu uemura glue) and they lasted about two hours.  for my wedding, i had them professionally applied and one side came undone!  then i read a how-to article and it only recommended one brand - &amp;#34;it&#x27;s duo or dirt.&amp;#34;  well, i am definitely a believer.  i&#x27;ve worn them several times now without any problems.  and when i&#x27;m ready to remove the lashes, they come off very easily - no ripping out my natural lashes.  also, it&#x27;s cheap and you can find it pretty much anywhere.  love love love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing lashes for years and have tried lots of brands of glue including expensive ones from my beautician and cheap ones from Walmart. When I finally discovered Duo Clear it was like finding the holy grail. It works like a charm. It keeps my falsies in good condition so I can just keep wearing them and wearing them. It is super easy to just carefully pull the glue strip off the lash after removing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people prefer the dark color over this clear color, but I am not among them. I have both, but I prefer the clear. I like this one because I have shaky hands and if I am putting on the lashes and I accidentally \\&quot;miss\\&quot; and get a little bit of glue on say, the brow bone or something, I don&#x27;t have to worry about trying to go back remove a black glue smudge later and then reapplying shadow in that one spot. If I get a little bit of glue in the wrong spot; no biggie, it dries clear! Also, if you are going for a more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; look and don&#x27;t want a dark line above your eye or like to use other liner colors/shadows besides black, you really just want the clear glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps someone!</li>
    <li> DUO is the gold standard when it comes to false lashes! i absolutely LOVE this stuff! It doesn&#x27;t dry super fast, so you can adjust your lashes when applying them and it drys completely clear!</li>
    <li> not too great works ok.</li>
    <li> This is a great glue, I like that it is clear so you don&#x27;t necessarily have to wear liner. What can I say everyone uses this glue and it is highly recommended by a lot of make up artists.</li>
    <li> I always use it and will always be.</li>
    <li> Needed to replenish my lash glue supply and went with Duo because of its high reviews and affordability. I felt that I needed a bit more than the recommended amount of glue to get my lashes to stay, but otherwise it worked pretty well.</li>
    <li> Has to big a hole in the end and a lot comes out and gets all over eyelashes.  They need a smaller hole so it&#x27;s not such a mess.  If works but you have to be really careful with it.</li>
    <li> I DONT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS THING.IT IS NOT STICKY AT ALL. I TRIED ON MY FINGER IT FEELS LESS STICKY THAN COOKIE DOUGH. I MEAN SERIOUSLY!</li>
    <li> once you mess with it after it dry&#x27;s it turns white, I will try the dark colored one next time</li>
    <li> This is the only lash glue worth using!</li>
    <li> Very nice and it comes in 3 packs. Haven&#x27;t used them as yet tho</li>
    <li> I did not expect the size .. It was small to what i expect .. However .. The best lashs glue i ever use .. Last long and easy to cover</li>
    <li> Really amazing! It keeps my eyelashes on all day and is easy to clean off after! The glue dries clear so I don&#x27;t need to hide it with eyeliner.  5/5!</li>
    <li> This glue is amazing. I&#x27;m a newbie when it comes to fake eyelashes, but I&#x27;ve used them a few times already and have been thoroughly impressed with the results. I was actually watching a youtube video which suggested this was the best glue (although she used the waterproof; I just couldn&#x27;t find it at the store). Anyway, it takes a little while for the glue to set, but that&#x27;s normal. You don&#x27;t want the glue to be watery so it&#x27;s sliding all over your eyelid and getting in your real eyelashes so waiting around is so the glue can get sticky. It only takes about 30 - 45 seconds - not that bad. What&#x27;s also nice about this glue is it&#x27;s easy to peel off. I was afraid it was going to be extremely painful - not so much. I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the eyelashes coming off in the middle of the day either. Personally I think you shouldn&#x27;t have that problem unless you&#x27;re going through army boot camp...which means you probably shouldn&#x27;t be wearing fake lashes anyway. One downfall is this stuff does dry clear and looks slightly shiny; I just go over it with my gel eyeliner to hide it. I haven&#x27;t had anyone comment about seeing the glue, so I would say it works great! My suggestion is watch a youtube video based on how to apply the glue. It will be easier and you can see how much all the girls use.</li>
    <li> I have used Duo brand of eyelash glue before and loved it but this stuff is horrible!</li>
    <li> My favorite lash glue!</li>
    <li> I love this glue  keeps my eyelashes  on all day :)</li>
    <li> I had a horrible experience once with store bought eyelash glue that came in a kit. This product was recommend to me and now I won&#x27;t use anything else. I do t use false eyelashes every day, only for special occasions so when I am using this it gets alot of wear. This stand up like a champ against tears, sweating, rubbing, and make up application.</li>
    <li> I needed a lash adhesive that actually worked, and this was recommended to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was fighting with an inferior glue and trying to get my lashes to stick all day.  I was losing!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product, which came in 2 days, and tried it before a Christmas party I was attending.  I brought it along, just in case the lashes started lifting on me like usual.  I never had to use it!  The Duo adhesive holds perfectly, and the white glue color does dry completely clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and highly recommend it to keep your lashes on all day long with no lifting of the corners, or glue showing on your eyes.</li>
    <li> I personally do not like this eyelash glue. I&#x27;ve repurchased perhaps twice but I always find myself looking at the inner corners to slowly come off.. Even some of my friends experience the same thing. And when I try to curl my natural lashes and falsies to bind them together, it comes right off. I just prefer the Kiss eyelash glue as it&#x27;s waterproof, dries clear and is very strong.</li>
    <li> This glue is for people who don&#x27;t want their eyelashes to be ripped out. Its easy to apply to your lashes (the glue is very sensative nd comes out with a really lite squeeze) I used this and wore my lashes for more than 8 hours nd they stayed on just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the smell of this glue though. It coming off really easy makes up for it though. I only gave it a 4 star because I don&#x27;t like how fast the glue comes out. Its too sensative.</li>
    <li> So I have been using this forever now and somehow it still lasts me. Such a strong hold it has. Goes on easy and non messy. I have used this glue for my eyelashes and at the end of the day when I go to take my lashes off, I literally have to yank them off thats how good this glue works. I also have gotten it in my eye a couple of times and it doesnt burn as bad as other adhesives do. Which I believe is a good thing about this product do to it being so close to your eyes. The drying time as well is pretty fast so there isnt much room for messups with this eyelash adhesive.</li>
    <li> He glue doesn&#x27;t last long! Very very disappointed</li>
    <li> Very good hold. Nothing like the glue that comes with the lashes. It dries clear so that&#x27;s a plus. Would defiantly buy again.</li>
    <li> Nice eyelashes glue 👍&lt;br /&gt;Definitely going to purchase it again</li>
    <li> Best fake eyelash glue around! And believe me, I have tried many. This one does not irritate my eyes even if i accidently get some in them! Also it stays on all day, holding onto those lashes like a charm! It has passed the humid, hot summer test too ;)</li>
    <li> Duo ashesive is my go-to for falsies. Have been loyal to this brand as it is such a good product. Lasts really long and doesn&#x27;t take forever to dry. Tip: Put on eyeliner on top of glue/lash line once it dries... The glue doesn&#x27;t dry completely clear.</li>
    <li> Great fast drying adhesive for fake lashes.  Easy to put on and comes off really easy!! Definitely my go to lash glue!</li>
    <li> best lash glue i can find at a good price</li>
    <li> This glue is white, it is not clear at all. It was the main reason I bought it.  Pretty pissed.  It was extremely obvious and hard to remove from the lashes, it looked like I used white out.  I threw it in the garbage and will never purchase again, what a total scam.</li>
    <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt;deserve 5 stars</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> Do not like this glue do not recommend</li>
    <li> it doesnt stick, so unhappy :-(</li>
    <li> White lash glue dries clear. Easily picked off removed lashes enabling reuse of the strip lash. Reminds me of rubber cement when dried.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and works well. Can directly apply from the tube if you&#x27;re careful. Wait a few seconds for the glue to dry before you apply it. Pretty sticky but the ends of the lashes are still tricky and tend to stick up a bit unless you put extra glue there. Stayed on all night and easy to peel off.</li>
    <li> Love this product, the price is cheaper than in stores so that&#x27;s a plus</li>
    <li> Very hard to make &amp;#34;mistakes&amp;#34; and you end up with a lot of gunk on your eyelid if you decide you didn&#x27;t want to use the lashes.</li>
    <li> This stuff works! I have used eyelash glue where it starts to fall off halfway into the night but not this stuff. It is supposed to apply on clear but it is actually white. It is not a big deal for me because I usually put on black eyeliner over it anyways. It may seem like a problem for some people though - and if it is, buy the black version! Duo is such a great brand.</li>
    <li> Ladies make sure you actually work on the amount of glue you put on because it will ruin your eye lashes. I put way too much and now my eye lashes are ruined! Beginners take your time because it will become a waste of time. Also don&#x27;t act surprised when you bottle literally is very small the title does say 0.25 ounce you should expect much nor do you need much of the glue for all the times you put eye lashes on. I now know to put my glue on the tip of a old make up brush and rub it on my eyelashes than put it on my eyelid rather than put it directly on the eyelashes because it will get messy very quickly and the lashes will clunk together. I wish i could show a picture but i had to throw them out. Good luck though</li>
    <li> This is a staple item for fake eyelashes.  I bought this because I was buying eye lashes and thought the price was good.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the applicator tip because sometimes it comes out too much and messes up the false lash. I tried squeezing the glue out gently and slowly to control the outpour, but often times that doesn&#x27;t work too well. Otherwise, the glue is pretty good quality as compared to the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Has Formaldehyde. I thought this ingredient was banned. I got an allergic reaction. Not worth damaging your eyes over falsies. Buyer Beware. health hazard. I hope Amazon will stop selling this item.&lt;br /&gt;Deserves NO STARS.</li>
    <li> This works very well. I use it to but body gems on our groves members for festivals and feasts. I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Long lasting and waterproof. Ease of application and consistently provides excellant adhesion Great product that provides what is advetised Thanks</li>
    <li> This is the best eyelash adhesive ever! It is really strong, you just need a little bit and one tube lasts you a really long time. I use false lashes every single day with this adhesive and it&#x27;s been about 2 months and I still have lots of it left in the tube. It dries up clear so that is why I love it. Favorite Eyelash Adhesive.</li>
    <li> This glue did it&#x27;s job perfectly, I had huge false feather eyelashes and they stayed for a two hours dancing show without moving at all and when I came home it was easy to take them away, so recommended stuff!</li>
    <li> Be careful with how hard you squeeze it. Actually, don&#x27;t squeeze it at all, just let it drip out. It also smells like semen.</li>
    <li> I have been trying fake eyelashes for years and could never get them placed right or get the ends to stay in place, but with this product, they work like a charm! I have been telling all my friends about this and its one of the best makeup investments Ive ever made!!! It looks white when you put it on, but drys to a clear so you can see where the glue is intially, but then becomes invisible.  I found this product from watching a makeup tutorial, it Im so glad I Found it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY EYE LASHES WILL EVEN STAY ON OVERNIGHT, IN THE POOL, AND ALL DAY!!  I will be buying this product for the rest of my life, and wearing fake eye lashes on a daily basis, thank you DUO eye lash adheasive!!!</li>
    <li> I started wearing fake lashes last Fall, so I&#x27;m becoming more experienced. This glue okay, but you have to close the tube quickly to keep any residue from drying in the tip. Once that happens, you have to push the dried residue out and you lose a little. I prefer a tip that is more pointed because less comes out on the lash strip. You have to go slower with this tip. I prefer the white/clear over the black as it is more forgiving if you apply it heavier than what&#x27;s needed.</li>
    <li> LOOOOOOOVE this adhesive. I usually carry it in my bag while out, but really never need to reapply for security purposes. The best part is that it dries clear!</li>
    <li> You can wear your lashes for days and they will stay there!! Great product, great quality, I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> it works well with my fake lashes. i just wish it is transparent color and not white or black. ..</li>
    <li> I got these for my niece to go with her bundle of lashes. These had a good review and they were well priced.</li>
    <li> Be warned, this is a very small tube.  I previously purchased a DUO glue from MAC and it was a little pricey but came in a bigger tube than this.  I expected the same size, but I should&#x27;ve double checked the ounces.  I like this glue, however it is not &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; it is white.  and sometimes the white glue sticks to my normal eyelashes and you can still see white along my lid.  It disappears after I load on the eyeliner, however next time I am buying the black glue so I won&#x27;t have this problem again.  Also check the weight :P</li>
    <li> A good product since it keeps eyelashes on longer than other glues, however, it somewhat burns upon application.</li>
    <li> Made applying my eyelashes easy.  I followed the directions, making sure to let it sit for 30 seconds before applying to your eyelid.  They held all day and all night without lifting at all.  I even put some liquid liner over the edge of them to conceal them further.  It was awesome!  When it was time to remove them, they peeled right off my lids, and I could easily get the glue out of the lashes.  I recommend this product for anyone who is trying eyelashes for the first time.  It worked for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard not to be aggravated when trying to apply dang false eyelashes, but I know that the reason for my annoyance was not the adhesive but just my own ineptitude at the task. Once I actually attached the lashes they stayed on for a long time. It dries clear after a while, it got me worried for a minute when it was white for several minutes.</li>
    <li> Fake!!!be aware!! I compare it with one I bought from Sally beauty ,it&#x27;s different. It&#x27;s scam or garbage not worth even 1 cent!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with these came in good packaging came fast and there were quite a few great value !! Will reorder again</li>
    <li> Company should now increase the size in the same amount it&#x27;s one of the best selling glue now for the lashes</li>
    <li> the best lash adhesive! dries clear and very long lasting. stays put until you remove it. easy to peel off as well so you can re-use the lashes.</li>
    <li> I like wearing fake lashes but I love for them to look natural. This product glue helps give you that look because it goes on white but dries clear...Awesome. Lastly, very durable. Only have to apply one time. Best product for fake lashes.</li>
    <li> This glue sucks. It doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> DUO is the best brand on the market for eyelash adhesives. I can&#x27;t say anything else other than, place it on the band properly and give it enough time to get tacky and then place the lashes on your lid where you want them and prepare to look fabulous all day. I&#x27;ve never swam in them or showered in them so I can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s wearability in water but as far as this adhesive holding lashes in place all day and comfortably, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I have been using DUO in the moist humid heat of the southern U.S. so it holds well in humidity.</li>
    <li> So this glue is AMAZING!! I love wearing fake lashes and just as a proof of how good this glue is I&#x27;ll share a quick story; so I did a 5K just recently and well everyone wears costumes. I ofcourse wanted to rock my lashes to compliment the crazy neon make up. So I wore my lashes, at first I was worried that they would come off because I was going to be running and at the end of the race they have a huge party but I still wore them. Anyway, I ran like crazy, danced, jumped, sweated, AND took a shower and I still had the lashes on! of course while in the shower they started to come off but it&#x27;s only normal. I had my fake lashes on for about 9 hours and they never once came off! So worth the money!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know why the one I received did not stick at all, even on paper it doesn&#x27;t stick onto anything. The consistency of the tube I&#x27;ve received seems really runny rather than creamy or sticky, seem as though it&#x27;s starting to separate and you&#x27;re seeing some liquid specks.</li>
    <li> For my surprise this glue wasn&#x27;t as expected. I read a lot about it and I see most beauty gurus use it. The glue was very liquid (as in runny) which is not what&#x27;s expected, even though I applied with a slight pressure it ran all over my lash and I had to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the prob was with me not knowing how to use, however I called an expert friend who said this is not how it should be as she uses the black dou which isn&#x27;t the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glue took more than 30 seconds to become tacky, and it didn&#x27;t dry fast. I will admit it stock well on my lid when it dried, but when my eyes started watering it tore easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note if my discribtions did not match the real dou, then I got an expired product.</li>
    <li> works well. dries in a good amount of time in order to put on lashes. don&#x27;t push on tube to hard or to much will come out and cont. to come out. it&#x27;s easy to put on real lashes so practice makes perfect and be very close to mirror. also helpful if you put on false lashes then on you eyelid, then just use qtip to take off any xtra.</li>
    <li> I love how this adhesive really makes my falsies stay onto my eyes! Nice product!</li>
    <li> Thank you! Great item! Fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I like that this comes in a clear.  Easy to apply to lashes, not too sticky but enough to hold for the evening.</li>
    <li> I ordered because it was named best eyelash glue ever. I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I wanted to post to emphasize how fast the stuff got to my house. I know this brand is good because I have had friends that use this product it&#x27;s pretty awesome.</li>
    <li> This is a great glue it has the weirdest smell though lol it smells like fish flakes or something buts a great glue can&#x27;t complain to much</li>
    <li> It holds fairly well, as long as you don&#x27;t sweat!  Once you start to perspire, or if you cough and your eyes water, your eyelashes are OFF!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m a fan of this glue, it dries with pieces of glue that looks like you haven&#x27;t clean your eyes in the morning.  I&#x27;m not a pro with false eyelashes, so maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> To be fair, i&#x27;m still learning how to apply lashes, but after it dose get tacky (3-5 min) its really hard to remove if you make a mistake on placement. Also, did not dry clear.</li>
    <li> I only buy Duo Lash Adhesive, as it&#x27;s the only thing that works! Even when we buy less expensive lashes, this glue keeps them on and looking good.</li>
    <li> This glue is perfect for my needs. Easy to apply, and easy to peel of the lash band so that lashes can be reused.</li>
    <li> Product description misleading...product is not clear, but white (states will become clear when dry, but still remained visible). Also, didn&#x27;t adhere very well. And hard to remove.</li>
    <li> Do you want your lashes to fall off? Then buy another brand of lash glue! Swear my lashes would stick in a hurricane with this stuff.</li>
    <li> Lasts all day. Other reviews, ignore them and take it from me. Ms. Picky USA, IT WORKS. BUY!! READ NO MORE REVIEWS!!</li>
    <li> The best.. I wont ever use another. This keeps them on all day and removes easy!</li>
    <li> easy to apply, good quality</li>
    <li> This is the typical bond I have used for years but I recently found one on Amazon that last longer and adhears better.. Duo cannot compare to it.</li>
    <li> Duo lash glue is the best eyelash glue I have ever used! I am  so glad I purchased this glue to try, it keeps the lashes on all day with no haggle!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT &amp;#60;3 (-:</li>
    <li> This lash adhesive is really the only kind that I&#x27;ve tried that works, it stays on all day if used correctly, it&#x27;s not noticeable or anything.</li>
    <li> Not sure what exactly happened, but for some reason, I had an allergic reaction to the glue and my eyelid swelled up. I&#x27;ve used DUO lash glue in the past and never had this happen before.</li>
    <li> Glue works well but it stinks, though the smell does not stay. I won&#x27;t be buying it again but I am not disappointed.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Works well. 5 star seller. HIGHLY recommended!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This lash adhesive is good but lately I have an issue with it. It dry white instead of invisible. So I prefer dark.</li>
    <li> all the best! loved !!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Works pretty well but for some reason it smells really terrible. It&#x27;s not like I intentionally smell the glue but the odor is just so strong.</li>
    <li> my eyelashes don&#x27;t come off or move until I take them off at the end of the day. duo is good quality and dries clear.</li>
    <li> Works great, doesnt make a mess, dries clear and doesnt rip my eyelashes out when I remove the fake lashes</li>
    <li> The best adhesive out there at this pricepoint. and I have tried them all. Always go back to them time and time again. If you wear strip lashes or even individuals you should try this.</li>
    <li> good product. I like it a lot</li>
    <li> Great product, as described.</li>
    <li> As long as you don&#x27;t over apply and focus on getting the glue right on the ends, it is great product!</li>
    <li> Just a tip: a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> IM BARELY GETTING INTO THE FAKE EYE LASHES AND THIS IS THE PERFECT GLUE. I LOVE HOW MY LASHES STAY ON LONG AND ARE EASY TO TAKE OFF</li>
    <li> Any gal who wears mini lashes (like me - I usually buy a full pair and then cut each in half to make two pairs to make mini lashes) for the middle of my eye; this adhesive is the best and I&#x27;ve been using it for 15 years!  Just can&#x27;t war it in water and your lashes will come off if you cry!  Love it; it does the job when you want that extra bit of glam w/extra lashes.</li>
    <li> My daughter was in the nutcracker ballet this year and this was the first time we&#x27;ve done false eyelashes... over... and over.. and over again!  This glue worked great!  I saw some of the other dance moms struggle with other brands but we never had an issue with ours!  The trick is to be sure to let it get tacky on the false eyelash, about 20-30 seconds like the tube states, before attempting to attach to the eyelid.  That made all the difference!  I was also able to reuse the same set of eyelashes for several nights without this getting clumpy or gross.  Hers never came off during any of the shows, and yet it peeled off painlessly and easily every night.  I&#x27;m also a bit of a germaphobe, and the other kind with the applicator?  Yeah, that whole sticking the brush in and out and touching the eyelashes with it grossed me out, so I like that this tube is more sanitary, especially since someone is ALWAYS forgetting to get the glue!  Makes it easy to share!</li>
    <li> Was not up to the hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hole the glue comes out of is massive and in my opinion places waaaayyyt to much on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stick to revlon. Cheaper and a better product with the brush. Lasts longer too.</li>
    <li> Works well, goes dries clear.</li>
    <li> Has a smell but its a amazing  product</li>
    <li> Excellent received in Good condition</li>
    <li> As described, would buy again! Great with my false eye lashes!</li>
    <li> Amazing quality. It my 1st time to use an eyelash glue WITHOUT harming my True eyelash !! LOVED IT</li>
    <li> It took a little longer to bond then I thought it would but once it&#x27;s dried the lashes stayed in place all night.  I used this for a costume so I don&#x27;t know about it for everyday use but for my needs it was perfect.</li>
    <li> the best and lasts all day- no worries.</li>
    <li> Amazing lash glue. This stuff stays ON. You really don&#x27;t need a lot, just let a bubble of glue out through the tip and drag it along the lash, with a little extra on both ends. Wait about a minute maybe less, then put that sucker on your lash. It&#x27;s very forgiving of any mistakes so just adjust if you don&#x27;t get it spot on the first time around. The glue dries very quickly and securely and clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with my dolly wink upper and lower lashes, and it&#x27;s lasted through several nights of clubbing and halloween and windy conditions, and was still stuck on very firmly when I got home and removed my makeup - it goes the distance! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I really loved this product. It is so much better than the other ones. Yay, I am so happy and satisfied.</li>
    <li> Awesome glue. Came in perfectly packaged like from the store.</li>
    <li> Works well for fake lashes.  I use it with Ardell Natural Lashes, Demi Wispies Black.</li>
    <li> Duo white does NOT dry white. I dries translucent if you apply correctly. If you are using too much of the product, it will take very long to dry. FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS ON BOX IF YOU ARE A NEWBIE... Pros, we know this product is WELL WORTH IT!</li>
    <li> Nothing better than having this fr sticking lashes</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and glues in my fake lashes quickly.</li>
    <li> I Absolutely love this glue, it smells a bit awful but the outcome is worth it. Applying a thick line on the lash line takes quite a time to dry out , so it&#x27;s recommended to apply a thin line as said so in the instructions. But overall great product, definitely buying more.</li>
    <li> Works flawlessly and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a beginner at wearing eyelashes and this glue does the trick. I accidently fell asleep with my lashes on and they stayed on throughout the night. The glue hold really well</li>
    <li> I love this !  I usually wear strips of fake lashes but I tried out individuals and I loved it they stayed on my eyelashes for 3 days , until I took them off, there easy to take off but if I wanted them to stay a few days longer it would last !  The only thing is the glue is watery so it can shoot out if u squeeze to hard lol</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it offer.  I don&#x27;t that it can be used longer.</li>
    <li> Great product, the glue turns black once is dry,it doesn&#x27;t hurt when you peel them out at all. My own lashes don&#x27;t  suffer when I use this. This is a really great affordable glue.</li>
    <li> is the better adhesive. Jus I need!</li>
    <li> My lashes were on fleek. Any stronger and my skin would rip off. So I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good  adhesive for all types of eyelash users.</li>
    <li> This was easy to use and goes on white but dries clear. The glue did not irritate my eyes even when I worked up a sweat on a test run -- I wore the lashes during an exercise class to see what would happen and they stayed perfectly in place.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find any product that fulfils its promises nowadays, especially where adhesives are involved, but this product really does the job exactly as promised.  One of the few remaining &amp;#34;reliable old standbys&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Clear adhesive kind of sucks. It claims to dry clear but it doesnt. It makes you look like you  have crap in  your eyes and definitely makes your false lashes fake.</li>
    <li> This is absolute crap! When I opened my eyelash glue, it was obvious it has already been used. I brought two and the first one was fine but the second one was gross and had dried glue and smelled awful! Way worse than usual eyelash glue smell. It was definitely not brand new.</li>
    <li> This works well if you let it dry for about 30 seconds before applying the lash. It dries clear and holds my lashes all day. I put oil-free eye-makeup remover on a tissue and hold it on the lashes for a few seconds to loosen the lash, then wipe it off my lid.  It comes off the lashes easily so that I can reuse them. Just beware that it does contain latex. If you are sensitive to latex you will have swollen eyelids</li>
    <li> I have tried lots of glues. This one works best.  Even their brush on bonds quickly and easily.  It is easy to apply and less mess</li>
    <li> Not try yet, but everyone says works very well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this glue because of all of the positive reviews on Amazon, but for me personally it didn&#x27;t work that well. I used the Ardell waterproof glue before this, and Ardell held my lashes really well. When I switched to Duo, I noticed that even though I put extra glue on the ends and waited for the glue to become tacky, it never quite held the lashes in place. This morning on my way to work one of my eyelashes fell off. Not exactly the cutest look in the world. I&#x27;m going to try Revlon since I want to explore all my options. I hope Duo works out for others, but it just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm and higher quality than what you buy in stores there is no doubt I will buy more</li>
    <li> Easy to put on, and even it is easier for new lash user. After put some glue on the lush, just wait a few second, wait for it become clear. Use it for a long time.</li>
    <li> one of the best eyelash glues i love it  i tried many other brands at this one was one of the best</li>
    <li> This product was not what I had expected. For one thing, this product does not even keep the lashes stuck to you for long. However, the upside to this product is that there is no tearing of your regular lashes when you remove the false ones. Overall, this product was not worth the money. The seller was expedient in their delivery, and I received this product before the expected delivery date.</li>
    <li> It was alright. But, Was allergic to it so. Whatever. Still held those lashes though!</li>
    <li> It does its job pretty well.  Easy to apply and dries clear...but I found that a week after opening it starts to smell REALLY badly.  Something or chemical in the glue must be reacting badly to the air. I&#x27;m glad my eyelashes don&#x27;t have noses...If you can ignore that then it works well as a glue.</li>
    <li> Great item! It holds the lash in place.</li>
    <li> The Lash Adhesive is the same one that comes with most false eyelashes. The tube seals correctly, so the contents do not dry out before the next time it is used. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Worst eyelashes I ever bought. When you put them on they don&#x27;t look like you put any eyelashes on, its very light... It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
    <li> Works like its supposed to.  Just have to get used to how much to use.  Sometimes too little and they come loose.  Solid bead of adhesive and it stays all day - over 13 hours.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use any other eyelash glue.</li>
    <li> Love it, fast delivery and it works!</li>
    <li> Favorite Eyelash adhesive out there. I have tried the black one and there is something different about it, so I always go back to this one!</li>
    <li> Comes out in big goops, which gets all over my eyelashes and looks HORRIBLE. The product packaging is terrible, and the tiny bottle should most definitely have a tinier spout. However, the product itself (the lash adhesive) does its job.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money dosent work for s*** not good it&#x27;s not strong and will make your eyelashes fall in one day</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stick and will ruin your false lashes! Do not purchase. Also, it stinks. I put this on my eyelashes and ruined the pair because it ran. Not only that, it did not even stay on my eye. I even tried a second time thinking maybe it was too thin. Nope. This product is horrible.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s suppose to!</li>
    <li> Like many other lash adhesives..the smell is terrible, but I expected that.&lt;br /&gt;The adhesive takes a bit longer to become tacky, so just be patient when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;It does stay on all night though!</li>
    <li> its pricey for the amount it has. I usually buy this glue at the store for about the same price and it has more than the stuff here...oh and did I mention that some of the glue was a little dried up? so what do I recommend? Going to the store and buying this glue!! Trust me you&#x27;ll thank me!</li>
    <li> Perfect size. Great price!</li>
    <li> The best lash glue I&#x27;ve bought, and I&#x27;ve bought many. This actually works, dries fast, and leaves the tack you need.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully! It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or cakey and dries clear. It was recommended to me through a YouTube tutorial video and I&#x27;m definitely impressed! I&#x27;m never using the cheap stuff again and for the price and quality you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!!! :-)</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; makes the process easier.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Works very well stays on all day. Apply with a darning needle.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife as she added it to our cart. I assume it&#x27;s perfect due to zero complains from her on this project. Nice work Duo!</li>
    <li> Being a beginner to applying false lashes, ofcourse it was a bit difficult to work with this product, but once you keep practicing and make sure you have enough product for them to stick on well it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. Although I did expect there to be much more product inside the tube, a bit disappointed about that but whatever.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyelash glue I have ever used, hands down. My lashes will stay on for days with minimal touch up, but can be removed easily as well. This is the only eyelash glue I would ever recommend.</li>
    <li> the best eye lashs glow i ever tried&lt;br /&gt;white but turn to black after dried&lt;br /&gt;smell like fish :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and easy remove without harm the lashes</li>
    <li> This glue is awesome.. the best you can get.</li>
    <li> Not very useful. I tried really carefully to squeeze a little out at a time then a blop comes out.. doesn&#x27;t stick as well as i&#x27;d like at all, it comes off easily!! the duo brand with a brush is much easier to use.. better not buy this one!!</li>
    <li> Hold lashes on forever! I will buy more of this kind I have tired many but this is by for the best glue.</li>
    <li> A few girls on YouTube use this product so I decided to give it a try and I&#x27;m glad I did. My lashes stay in place without having to touch it up.</li>
    <li> I heard so many good things about this adhesive I just had to try it, it definitely holds way better and lasts longer than the ardell lash glue I had before! this is now my go to lash glue</li>
    <li> Good strong adhesive at a good price. I was able to sleep in my lashes &amp; still able to wake up &amp; have them flawless.</li>
    <li> I love it ..its amazing how light my falselashes feels after applying this glue it stays throughout the day and I almost forget that I&#x27;m wearing them, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin like the other ones I used, this glue is super easy to remove, no need for makeup remover or anything like that.  if you&#x27;re wondering what brand of falselashes to get, I&#x27;d recommend Red Cherry lashes! :)</li>
    <li> The glue gave me an allergic reaction and I had to throw it out</li>
    <li> Love this glue. Havnt had any problems with it. Dries clear. Just make sure you don&#x27;t use too much because it can become visible. Holds my lashes for a long time</li>
    <li> Great adheasive. Held lashes on quickly and all day. The box was damaged in my box of other shipment, but it wasn&#x27;t too concerning as the tube was still intact. Lashes were easy to get off too, didn&#x27;t feel like I  had to rip my eyelashes out in order to get the fake ones off</li>
    <li> The best thing I order I  recommend this item for all</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used falsies before and I disobeyed the instructions but the glue was pretty easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;Sticks but not icky sticky when dry.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really hars to find good lash glue for some reason. This is great for lighter strip lashes but if your lookinnfor dramtic lashes or long wear glue look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> this is really great glue, this is my first time using this for eyelashes, but I really like it .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years ive always gone back and forth between duo and revlon there both easy to use, this carrier has really fast shipping the product it self for me gets 4 stars i gave it 5 because the shipping was so fast.</li>
    <li> I have no more to say but beat glue ever, it stays there, doesn&#x27;t show color, doesn&#x27;t smell, I love it</li>
    <li> I got this to use with individual lashes because i didnt want them to be glued on for weeks at a time and it works perfectly! It dries quickly and also comes off pretty smoothly when using either makeup wipes or some baby oil. The only thing i didnt like about it, is it doesnt exactly dry clear unless you have a very minimal amount. It was easily covered up though with some mascara.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyelash glue I have used thus far. My lashes stayed on perfectly and didn&#x27;t look clumpy whatsoever. When it was time to remove them I applied some eye cream and they came right off without pulling my eyelashes. Great eyelash adhesive.</li>
    <li> Duo is my favorite eyelash glue! I have since learned that i am alergic to latex, so i have purchased Duo&#x27;s non latex version of this. I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I&#x27;m sure that it&#x27;s just as good as this one!</li>
    <li> Much more worth it than buying it at Walgreens even though they&#x27;re the exact same size. It doesn&#x27;t have that weird smell that the one I bought from Walgreens does too! Yay!</li>
    <li> the best eyelashes glue</li>
    <li> Didnt really care for this product. The lashes stay put but takes forever to dry and once its dried the glue turns white!</li>
    <li> I really like this product it does dry clear and I don&#x27;t use eyeliner cause I like a natural look and this helps me with the look. Also so far it has been on and not coming off.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eyelash glue. I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> pros:&lt;br /&gt;-it really does go clear&lt;br /&gt;-goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;-easy to remove from eye&lt;br /&gt;-doesnt leave eyelashes messy and its easy to remove it from them so u can reuse em&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;-its has a bad smell&lt;br /&gt;-NOT for sensitive eyes&lt;br /&gt;i have to reapply on the ends after every 4 hours (but i&#x27;ve had the same problem with every eyelash adhesive and those i have to reapply on the end every 2 hours)</li>
    <li> I love it, It is the best adhesive iv&#x27;e ever used. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and it dries clear.  good overall experience with both the product and the supplier.</li>
    <li> It is easy to apply to lashes. Not too sticky but enough to hold for the evening. It does not irritate my eyes.</li>
    <li> it took too long to dry, waste of money, i want something that isnt as watery as this one. #ew</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get my lashes to stay put with this glue.</li>
    <li> I love it... even it is light in color, however the color will disappear once it dry.. amazing product for eye lashes</li>
    <li> I prefer the dark glue.  This tends to dry and then there are &amp;#34;chunks&amp;#34; on my eye lashes.  I won&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> I just started using false eyelashes and I purchased a kit that already had the glue included. It was very thin to say the least and I was getting frustrated with the eyelashes. I saw the reviews here at Amazon and decided to try the Duo adhesive. It&#x27;s a very good adhesive and I have to say that I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> The best Lash Adhesive, especially better with the &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; color. Keeps lashes were you put them, and lasts allll day.</li>
    <li> Did not work very well at all.</li>
    <li> i did not get it it is block in our countre</li>
    <li> Does good and I plan on buying it again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Good product, received ahead of schedule.. Duo is always reliable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty new at this, but am so far happy with this adhesive. it&#x27;s good for my dark lashes. right now i&#x27;m using individuals and this keep them in all night, which is all i want.</li>
    <li> This glue did absolutely nothing to my lashes.  I rather use the lashes on their own without the glue since that sticks wayyy better.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best eyelash glues that I have tried so far. Just make sure that you let the glue get tacky before trying to apply false lashes or else they will not stick!</li>
    <li> Best lash glue ever. Keeps all of my heavy lashes on all day with no issues and comes off easilly when I want it to.</li>
    <li> This lash adhesive is better than others I&#x27;ve used. However, the product bought off Amazon sometimes has an issue where the tube can be a little dry or even old. The tube I got last time around was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re using it for the first time remember that it dispenses a lot of product if you&#x27;re not careful and then dries white rather than clear. My eyelashes felt cakey at first as I ended up dispensing too much product a few times. I also learned to wait before application as it takes time to get tacky. Unfortunately, if you make a mistake while applying lashes there is no going back and you have to start again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hold is great as it does not come off easily even if you cry!</li>
    <li> I use this for individual lashes...it works great!</li>
    <li> Great hold. Make sure that you don&#x27;t apply too much it might pull out your real lashes.</li>
    <li> Great product...have used it for years</li>
    <li> Today was actually my first day wearing fake eyelashes, well I put them on this morning with this glue &amp; Ive been busy all day, its 12AM now and my eyelashes are still on strong even after not doing so well applying them lol</li>
    <li> It hold my lashes perfectly, clear and it blend good with my eyeliner.</li>
    <li> It works to keep false eye lashes on very well, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or have any funny smells.</li>
    <li> THIS LEAVES THE NUDE COLOR RESIDUE ..YUK</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says! Easy to apply, didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, and dries clear! I would def purchase again in the future! Also I used makeover remover to clean off the end of the night!</li>
    <li> This adhesive is excellent... except for the smell. It does go away once it dries. However, it&#x27;s a product that works and it&#x27;s very affordable. I own this, the dark adhesive and the Duo brush-on. Each version has something unique about it. You can use this clear one on top of the lashes if you feel like the ends are not really sticking to your eyelids.</li>
    <li> Half the glue always ends up on my hand, or on the lashes itself and it do a good job of keeping my lashes on because they always end up falling</li>
    <li> The Duo Lash adhesive works fine, no problems. Just follow the directions and it should work out well for you.</li>
    <li> The best lash adhesive hands down. If you apply them right, they won&#x27;t budge until you take them off.</li>
    <li> This particular adhesive sucks, I used it and it still stayed white and my eyelashes came off not even 2 hours after use. i just took it right out easily. i do not recommend this product</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold for long.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Just as expected.</li>
    <li> It does what you would expect and want.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I would buy it again and since it dries clear no one can see my mistakes.</li>
    <li> Good adhesive for eyelashes and body jewelry. Does not irritate the skin or eyes like some products do.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I am fair skinned so I wear brown lashes and the black glue to way to dark for me since I don&#x27;t wear black liner.  This glue dries clear.  Put it on the lashes and wait about 30 sec until it gets tacky and then apply.</li>
    <li> Good adhesive!  Thank you</li>
    <li> It works great, love it</li>
    <li> duo is the best lash glue in my opinion</li>
    <li> stays on and is not clumpy</li>
    <li> Keeps my false lashes on all day.</li>
    <li> Bought this product from a store instead and absolutely hated it. It made my eyes extremely irritated, stuck my eyelashes together and took forever to get completely off. Worst part though is that it didn&#x27;t work, the eyelashes NEVER stuck when I used this product. Definitely won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> This product is very good and long lasting wear. I am very pleased. Recommend to anyone who used lash adhesive</li>
    <li> I worked at the MAC counter and used this glue and it works great but putting that toxic substance near your eye is terrifying!!</li>
    <li> Sticks well and the small brush applicator is more accurate and less messy than the tube version.</li>
    <li> i am happy with its consistency and quality.. it is really a great product .. not onlt natural falsies but with every type of lashes it can be used. and it works wonders.</li>
    <li> But takes a minute to dry before applying which is standard.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyelash glue I have, holds on all night. No corners popping up. Make sure you let it sit and get tacky before you apply lashes - don&#x27;t apply wet.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. I like that it dries clear.</li>
    <li> fast ship and great item!!!</li>
    <li> Although this product has good rating, it didn&#x27;t last on me.  It doesn&#x27;t stick.</li>
    <li> This is a must for falsies. It dries clear so no worries about mistakes. Just make sure to wait til it gets tacky.</li>
    <li> This is the only lash glue I&#x27;ve used, and I found it works just fine. I mean, it&#x27;s lash glue - I&#x27;m not expecting something life-changing, just something that works, and this does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glue does have a scent to it, as it does contain fragrance, but it&#x27;s not very noticeable. I&#x27;m not sure why eyelash glue needs fragrance, but it&#x27;s not bothering anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff dries pretty quickly, but peels off easily - which is a good thing, because a gentle squeeze of the tube is enough to send globs of glue everywhere. I found that the best way to apply this (whether applying directly to a lash or lash band, or straight on the eyelid) is to squeeze a small amount on a surface (the back of your hand, a makeup container, anything works!) and use a fine liner brush to pick up a small amount and apply it. You can apply the glue straight from the tube, but I found that wasted more glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way to remove this from your eyelids is with an oil-free makeup remover. Sometimes my lashes get loose enough over the day that I can just peel them off, but more often than not, it feels less than pleasant to peel the lashes off without breaking down the glue first. Anywhere that isn&#x27;t the eyelid, I just rub or peel the glue off. It removes easily from plastic and metal, but I haven&#x27;t tried - nor do I plan to try - clothes or carpet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve not found this anywhere over $6, and that&#x27;s a price I feel totally comfortable paying for what I&#x27;m getting out of the product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Allergic, but I am sensitive....</li>
    <li> Really works well compared to some generic brand</li>
    <li> worked like a charm! make sure to follow the directions exactly, it does take thirty seconds for the glue to get tacky enough to stick to the eyelid</li>
    <li> Works awesome!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Smell is really off and weird, though.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I have an awful time applying &amp; keeping on lashes. This stuff is awesome, get sticky &amp; tacky quick enough and stays on forever. Awesome &amp;#60;3</li>
</ol>
