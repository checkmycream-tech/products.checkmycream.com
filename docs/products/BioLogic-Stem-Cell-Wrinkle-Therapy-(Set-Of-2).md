      <li>my son, whom I hadn&#x27;t seen for 6 months said \\&quot;Mom what&#x27;s going on, your skin hasn&#x27;t looked so good since you were 40!\\</li>

      <li>LOVE this product and tell all my friends !</li>
      <li>I love the Stem Cell Therapy cream, and the price is good.</li>
      <li>This does not contain any stem cells, they&#x27;re just saying it boosts your own stem cells.  </li>
      <li>This is wonderful moisturizing cream, and makes my skin feel so good, and look a little better too!!  </li>
      <li>I am an Esthetician and have tried many products.  </li>

      <li>will buy more if it goes on sale.</li>
      <li>I like to think this stuff is making me look and feel better.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years and just love it.  </li>
      <li>Like most 40 something Women, I&#x27;m up to try any anti aging product.  </li>
      <li>I used this product for more than a year and found it to be everything I wanted in a cream - non greasy, easy to apply, no drama.</li>
      <li>Need more time to see results, but so far happy with hydration and feel</li>
      <li>It certainly feels good on my skin.</li>
      <li>The price is good and you don&#x27;t have to use a large amount to cover the face.</li>
      <li>and it did not reduce the fine lines or wrinkles around my eyes.  </li>
      <li>Stem Cells are an important part of functions of our body.  </li>
      <li>It blends beautifully with other moisturizers.</li>
      <li>Very well thank you very much!!!</li>
      <li>This was offered at a great price and arrived a day before expected.  </li>
      <li>Got a sample in the mail and decided to try the full size.  </li>
      <li>Hopefully by the end of the second jar I will be more pleased.</li>
      <li>I really do recommend this product!!</li>
      <li>The Stem Cell Therapy eye cream was only effective as a moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I rarely got junk mail and, within a month of ordering this product (which I returned), I started getting all manner of health-related junk mail.</li>
      <li>You must use it consistently.  </li>
      <li>Second, most of the ingredients are listed by Environmental Working Group [...]</li>
      <li>the next more.  </li>
      <li>I have just commenced using BioLogic face cream and found it to have a smooth non sticky coverage leaving my face soft</li>
      <li>I have almost finished the first jar</li>
      <li>So I am pleased to have access to this product at such a reasonable price through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Uses it for more than a year, says there are no new wrinkles.</li>
      <li>Would not recommend spending so much on this product.</li>
      <li>Really makes a difference with the wrinkles.</li>
      <li>It works very well on my aging skin</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t see the effects from it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t pull down on your skin.  </li>
      <li>The high-priced items actually contain stem cells to replace our own that have aged.</li>
      <li>This cream makes my face feel soft - but do not except it to work as advertised on older skin because it</li>
      <li>Fine lines seem to be less noticable.</li>
      <li>After I stopped using it for a while, my skin started to look old again.</li>
      <li>This product is light and you notice the difference in only a few days.  </li>
      <li>And by the way - if you&#x27;re not happy with your results, you&#x27;re probably looking for more dramatic change, so it may be an idea to look into a more drastic remedy, such as botox or even a face lift.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is an excellent product.  Stem Cells are an important part of functions of our body.  As one matures, the body makes less Stem Cells. I have noticed an improvement in my skin since I have been using this product.  So I am pleased to have access to this product at such a reasonable price through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Virginia A. Dickey</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t give me the results I thought it could have  went thru 2 jars and to me this is not a cheap product tho cheaper than  a lot&lt;br /&gt;that don&#x27;t do anything at all</li>
    <li> what a great product I have used it several times and it has always performed and done a great job on my skin reducing the wrinkles on my forehead and around my eyes and making my skin glow great great product.</li>
    <li> The Stem Cell Therapy eye cream was only effective as a moisturizer.  I used it for 6 weeks and it did not reduce the fine lines or wrinkles around my eyes.  I was disappointed as it claimed to do so much more!  It&#x27;s NOT worth the $$$</li>
    <li> I like the soft texture of it and use it everyday at home.  It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t pull down on your skin.  The two pack item is a what I like to buy.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Third bottle. Notice actual changes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for moisturizer under make up and as a night cream for several years.  I find it soothing and healing skin care.  Fine lines seem to be less noticable.</li>
    <li> Has not been as much of a vast improvement as the Q Therapy has but I like it and will stick with the product.  Still is a wonderful improvement to my skin.</li>
    <li> Like most 40 something Women, I&#x27;m up to try any anti aging product.  Truly didn&#x27;t notice any visible results on this one.  Would not recommend spending so much on this product.</li>
    <li> HAVE USED IN THE PAST AND NOT SURE WHY I STOPPED  - SHOULDN&#x27;T HAVE.  GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> The product name is deceptive. This does not contain any stem cells, they&#x27;re just saying it boosts your own stem cells.  The high-priced items actually contain stem cells to replace our own that have aged. Just wanted to point out the difference for those who may think this compares to those $290 stem cell serums.</li>
    <li> my skin was horribly dry and had tried everything possible.&lt;br /&gt;When I got this product my skin changed 1000% in 48 hrs&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this product and tell all my friends !</li>
    <li> Very well thank you very much!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and just love it.  Really makes a difference with the wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product faithfully, however, I do NOT see any results, I keep waiting.  Hopefully in the next few weeks.</li>
    <li> have used it for several years now, and have seen some results</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d  rather not use the product because in the before picture, it seems like the lady has hardly any wrinkles and in the after she gains a lot of wrinkles. I think they made a mistake with the pictures .</li>
    <li> I have almost finished the first jar and I do see some improvement.  Hopefully by the end of the second jar I will be more pleased.</li>
    <li> I have just commenced using BioLogic face cream and found it to have a smooth non sticky coverage leaving my face soft the next more.  Need more time to see results, but so far happy with hydration and feel</li>
    <li> I am an Esthetician and have tried many products.  This product is light and you notice the difference in only a few days.  It blends beautifully with other moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I like to think this stuff is making me look and feel better.  It certainly feels good on my skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best face cream I have ever used!!! After I stopped using it for a while, my skin started to look old again. Using it again and my skin looks beautiful again. Will not go back to the other creams again!!!!!</li>
    <li> I started using this product the day I got it. It feels good on my face but I have noticed no difference in the lines or wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year, wrinkles have faded drastically, it is not greasy. The price is good and you don&#x27;t have to use a large amount to cover the face. I would recomend this product to every one</li>
    <li> This product sucks. It does nothing. It is a total waste of money. No longer use it. Would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Thank you</li>
    <li> I love the Stem Cell Therapy cream, and the price is good. It comes in 2 packs by 1oz jars each. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says.  You must use it consistently.  This was offered at a great price and arrived a day before expected.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful moisturizing cream, and makes my skin feel so good, and look a little better too!!  I really do recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> It seemed okay for a while.  I really don&#x27;t see the effects from it.</li>
    <li> I baught it for my mother in low. She likes it. Uses it for more than a year, says there are no new wrinkles.</li>
    <li> First, they practice misleading advertising:  When you receive the product and the accompanying pamphlet, it reads \\&quot;results dramatized\\&quot; in small print beneath photos.  That means the before/after photos are touched up.  Second, most of the ingredients are listed by Environmental Working Group [...] as ones to avoid.  Third, and most annoying, is Biologic sells your address to junk mail lists.  I rarely got junk mail and, within a month of ordering this product (which I returned), I started getting all manner of health-related junk mail.</li>
    <li> The additional benefit, apart from getting rid of wrinkles, was it got rid of raised spots on my face.  One spot&#x27;s brown color changed to skin color.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Got a sample in the mail and decided to try the full size.  It works very well on my aging skin and I use daily.</li>
    <li> This cream makes my face feel soft - but do not except it to work as advertised on older skin because it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I am on my second jar with the third one in the cupboard.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t order anymore because it is expensive when it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> will buy more if it goes on sale.</li>
    <li> I used this product for more than a year and found it to be everything I wanted in a cream - non greasy, easy to apply, no drama. However, I did not notice a difference in wrinkles etc (I&#x27;m 68 and have a really good skin). Then I went back to my home country for a visit and my son, whom I hadn&#x27;t seen for 6 months said \\&quot;Mom what&#x27;s going on, your skin hasn&#x27;t looked so good since you were 40!\\&quot; Then I recently ran out of product and decided to try a cream from another well known company. After two weeks, my face feels like I&#x27;ve rubbed cornflour all over it. So, does Stem Cell Therapy work? You bet it does! If I could give it 10 stars I would. And by the way - if you&#x27;re not happy with your results, you&#x27;re probably looking for more dramatic change, so it may be an idea to look into a more drastic remedy, such as botox or even a face lift.</li>
