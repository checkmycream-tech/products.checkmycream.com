      <li>Okay ive wanted this for the longest.</li>
      <li>Great product and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Just love this lip balm.</li>
      <li>I love this product but it is a bit pricey.  </li>
      <li>I just love this lip treatment.  </li>
      <li>She loves it and has already ordered more.  </li>
      <li>Read more at [...]</li>
      <li>I have tried so many lip balms and treatments.  </li>
      <li>have heard that in warmer climates, Fresh lip treatment may melt, but we had a very warm summer, and my Fresh was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the best for dry chapped lips both summer and winter!  </li>
      <li>Though I can&#x27;t complain as I got it free for my birthday from Sephora, but I would love to get this product again.</li>
      <li>The Fresh Sugar Lip Treatment has a really nice sweet/lemony fragrance and no taste.  </li>
      <li>None is really more effective than the others (or I&#x27;d chuck the rest and keep just one) but fresh SUGAR is the slipperiest and for that reason has a special place in my lexicon.  </li>
      <li>It ain&#x27;t easy to give up stuff that works, but I&#x27;d rather go on the hunt than stick with stuff that could damage my health.</li>
      <li>I was beyond thrilled to discover that the mini Fresh Sugar Lip Treatment was the Sephora Beauty Insider birthday gift for February (the fabulous month of my birth).  </li>
      <li>All around perfect lip balm from a high quality health conscious brand.</li>
      <li>My lips were just fine.</li>
      <li>It is all natural and has light pleasant scent of lemon and brown sugar.</li>
      <li>These lip treatments nourish, smooth, and protect my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have tried everything , cheap and not so cheap,</li>
      <li>Fresh Sugar Lip Treatment is a refreshing product.</li>
      <li>I have Honey &amp; Petal &amp; they are great colors &amp; actually have staying power.</li>
      <li>Fresh is one of my favorite perfume and soap brands.</li>
      <li>my lips felt like I had been using a cheap waxy Chapstick.  </li>
      <li>I am a &#x27;Fresh&#x27; fan, and wear the sugar lip treatment most of the time.</li>
      <li>The balm itself tasted great, and after two days of using it, my lips felt a lot smoother from being chapped prior to use.</li>
      <li>Since using the lip treatment they are moist &amp; comfortable all the time.</li>
      <li>The Pacifica Color Quench is also just as good and has better showing color, especially if you have darker lips.</li>
      <li>It feels good going on, but the product is way too soft.</li>
      <li>I love it so much I have one for home and one for my purse and even purchased as Christmas gifts for my daughters!</li>
      <li>The staff is pretty nice and very moisture for lip.</li>
      <li>it is great, and was the first lip balm ever not have caused my lips to chap further after its gone.</li>
      <li>and I have been a loyal customer every since.  </li>
      <li>The rose has a lovely pink tint.  </li>
      <li>Texture is silky and super moisturizing.</li>
      <li>you get a full size Fresh Lip Treatmnt and a .28 sugar lip polish and a 3.4 oz body cream plus</li>
      <li>or if they changed something, but I love my new ones.  </li>
      <li>They get absorbed or licked off or heaven knows what so I&#x27;m always replenishing them.  </li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>however, to my amazement, I was so pleased that I decided to post reviews to help others - who are just like me desperately looking for the best value lip balm.    </li>
      <li>So fresh SUGAR is one of 9</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t buy it on Amazon; I went walked into a Sephora just to look around and ended up walking out with a Fresh sugar lip balm.</li>
      <li>If you have smile lines - try it on them at night.  </li>
      <li>It is a bit pricey but worth it.  </li>
      <li>I love the way it feels on my lips, silky and smooth, but that that same silky smoothness applies to the product in the tube as well and on warmer days it seems a little...melted.  </li>
      <li>BUT when my lips were beyond dry, rough, and sore when nothing worked, this is the BEST thing I have ever</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure what is in this, but it feels great, and my lips won&#x27;t let me go without it</li>
      <li>and I only need to reapply 2 or 3 times in the whole day at the most!</li>
      <li>But I can buy a good hand cream for a lot less money too.</li>
      <li>I really like this product!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> First purchased this several years ago and can&#x27;t live without it. Great at conditioning and must have in winter.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used for chapped lips. The first one was a gift and I have been a loyal customer every since.  Would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> you get a full size Fresh Lip Treatmnt and a .28 sugar lip polish and a 3.4 oz body cream plus a red make up bag all for $28 just $6 more than the lip treatmet itself!!</li>
    <li> I finally bought this product last week.... I kept on coming back &amp; trying it on at Sephora and I liked how it feels but it is so expensive! For $22 I can buy like 6 lip balms already. But I thought to my self I need a working and real Lip Balm so I FINALLY found one and I am very happy and please with the result!  I will totally buy it again.</li>
    <li> I was fortnate enough to receive this lipbalm as a gift so I didn&#x27;t have to fork over the $22 price tag. I heard it was a great product and all the hype was actually correct. Initially the lemon scent was overwhelming and it was a bit annoying, within a day&#x27;s use I got used to the smell. I apply this lip balm right before bedtime and in the morning, especially before I apply lipstick. It is very moisturizing and not heavy/greasy at all. Great for protecting the lips while snowboarding.</li>
    <li> I just love this lip treatment.  It works great and smells great.  I use it every day!  It is a bit pricey but worth it.  I have tried so many lip balms and treatments.  This is one of my favorites!</li>
    <li> I had been wanting this forever, but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay the $22, so I was thrilled to get the Sephora birthday gift of a mini 2 pack!  They feel amazing going on, silky and buttery, and they smell nice.  The rose has a lovely pink tint.  After wearing them for several hours my lips felt like I had been using a cheap waxy Chapstick.  It was kind of cakey feeling and my lips actually started peeling for the first time in forever.  I was so disappointed!  I&#x27;ve only been using them for a couple of days, so I&#x27;ll see if they get any better, but so far, I am not impressed.  What a bummer :(&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I was given another couple of the small size of these in different shades.  These new ones don&#x27;t have that waxy feeling at all!  I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad batch before or if they changed something, but I love my new ones.  The colors are a little more opaque so they really look more like a lipstick, but they feel wonderful!</li>
    <li> I love the slippery feel of this lip balm!  I have to say that my lips are extremely resistant to help with chronic dryness.  I spend hours at my computer and have surrounded myself with an assortment of lip balms in my desperate attempt to solve my problem.  So fresh SUGAR is one of 9 (count &#x27;em!) different lip balms at my fingertips.  I rotate through them during the day.  They get absorbed or licked off or heaven knows what so I&#x27;m always replenishing them.  None is really more effective than the others (or I&#x27;d chuck the rest and keep just one) but fresh SUGAR is the slipperiest and for that reason has a special place in my lexicon.  P.S. It&#x27;s the least expensive of my higher end choices as well.</li>
    <li> This is my go to lip product.Texture is silky and super moisturizing.It is all natural and has light pleasant scent of lemon and brown sugar. Tube is well made. I love the fact that it has twist top,to make sure it never opens accidentally.SPF does not hurt either.I mostly use colorless type but rose is nice too.It is very subtle gives my lips natural healthy color. All around perfect lip balm from a high quality health conscious brand.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few products I&#x27;ve tried that moisturizes without irritating my lips. This product makes them feel super soft even when they&#x27;re dry. The only downside is the price compared to other products out there. If your looking for a more economical choice that&#x27;s about half the price of this product without losing out on its quality then try Jane Iredale lip drink.  Other than its price, especially if your like me constantly reapplying, this is a great lip treatment.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I use on my lips during the winter. It smells and feels good, along with that it keeps my lips from peeling. Better than plain chapstick!</li>
    <li> This is her favorite lip balm ~</li>
    <li> Superior lip treatment, but price was outrageous for a tube of lip treatment.  I would buy this forever, if it wasn&#x27;t so costly.  Cost was so high I probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I used Sugar lip balm for months, and it was the best I could find for my lips (I actually used to use rose - the pink one)...it is great, and was the first lip balm ever not have caused my lips to chap further after its gone. I put up with the $22 price tag. on top of that it doesnt last since its very creamy. for my it used to last a month or so. A friend told me about Alba ($3 or so) and I was skeptical since I ve been disappointed with the cheaper ones. however, to my amazement, I was so pleased that I decided to post reviews to help others - who are just like me desperately looking for the best value lip balm.    quite frankly, I would rate this a 5 star if it weren&#x27;t for the price. a total rip off. especially for the colorless sugar lip balm. the rose has a beautiful sheen and natural color that that Alba doesnt have. however, I can use it sparingly and not a pay a $22 monthly \\&quot;tax\\&quot; as before.</li>
    <li> I love this product but it is a bit pricey.  However,, ti does moisturize my lips for extended periods of time.</li>
    <li> A great lip balm and it feels wonderful but not worth the money. Save your money and get Aquafor or blistex.</li>
    <li> Worth the money. This Chapstick will make the dryest lips soft! I recommend this product over any other Chapstick. You will be amazed!</li>
    <li> I am 56  &amp; though always have had very dry skin (except for oily eyelids,sigh), but since turning 50 my skin is even dryer.  Also I have allergies so often I sleep breathing through my mouth, making my lips even dryer.  I have tried everything , cheap and not so cheap, nothing works.  My lips are cracked and rough, I end up pulling of the rough dry skin ( I do mean dry, after off lips it is like thin, brittle paper with NO moister or softness.), this means I end up also pulling off new skin also, making sore spots and the cycle keeps going.  I have been like this and nothing helped, every day for the last week.  I forgot I had this in an older purse, for over a year, so I put some on, way to thick due to how dry my lips were and I was only going to be home.  I have used it 4 times in the last 24 hours;  ALL my rough dryness, and soreness is gone!  I used this when I only wanted to keep my lips moist, but not needing to also GET them moist and it was nice and did the job, but so did other cheaper things.  BUT when my lips were beyond dry, rough, and sore when nothing worked, this is the BEST thing I have ever used!&lt;br /&gt;I think those who do not like it do not have really dry lips. It can fill a bit messy but so much better then dry sore lips!  I use it off and on during the day and when I go to bed. Finally I can wear lipstick again!</li>
    <li> Best. Lip. Treatment. EVER.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm. I have allergies and very sensitive skin. This is one of the few lip products that I can wear with out any adverse reaction.</li>
    <li> I usually apply a little under any lipstick or alone for lubrication and protection; never had any irritation from the Fresh line of products.</li>
    <li> The Fresh Sugar Lip Treatment has a really nice sweet/lemony fragrance and no taste.  I&#x27;m used to glosses that smell and taste sweet, so I was a little surprised by the lack of a flavor, but it&#x27;s a refreshing change!  I love the way it feels on my lips, silky and smooth, but that that same silky smoothness applies to the product in the tube as well and on warmer days it seems a little...melted.  Because it&#x27;s so slick, I wear it alone.  Usually I&#x27;ll use a lip moisturizer or something under my lipstick, but in this case I just let my natural color show through.  The lip treatment lasts until I have a big meal or less if I drink a lot of coffee that day, so I&#x27;ll have to reapply at lunch time.  Fresh Sugar Lip Treatment is a refreshing product.</li>
    <li> I NEVER in my entire life wore lip balm or anything on my lips. I never understood why I always saw everyone putting it on. My lips never chapped. My lips were just fine. My lips were invincible!&lt;br /&gt;Then...this past Christmas my cousin gifted me this lip balm. I haven&#x27;t been the same since.&lt;br /&gt;First of all it&#x27;s mid-June and I only just now had to purchase the second tube, and I use it at least 3-22 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;I find myself NEEDING to put it on. My lips feel amazing. I&#x27;m not sure what is in this, but it feels great, and my lips won&#x27;t let me go without it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I sort of wish it didn&#x27;t look so much like lipstick...being a guy, and all, but you can discreetly put it on...or just not care what anyone thinks, because people see a lot weirder things in Manhattan than a guy putting on what appears to be lipstick.</li>
    <li> Okay ive wanted this for the longest. Heard great things about it so when i finally got it i was seriously excited. Im sad to say i was dissapointed. Maybe i got a bad one who knows. But this was nothing special especially for the price and it left my lips with little bumps on them. Almost like a heat rash. It got sticky and i had to keep reapplying it throught the day. Maybe it will work for others but it didn&#x27;t work for my sensitive dry lips. But thank the lord for aquaphor lip treatment. Cleared everything up in three days and my lips dont feel dry anymore. Even with nothing on them.</li>
    <li> I have to butt in and give a mediocre rating.  I saw this in Sephora and just &#x27;had&#x27; to get it because they said it was the best lip balm in existence.  Well I had it on my mind for a month and then I broke down and got it.  It smells and tastes fine, glides on smoothly, but I had mildly chapped lips initially and with this it took 2 days of constant application to soften them.  And with just daily (maintenance) use I can&#x27;t say I noticed any huge improvement in the moisture of my lips. It should have kept my lips moisturized between lunch and dinner at the least.    I&#x27;d give it a 3 or 4 star if it were just for the product quality, but the fact that it is so expensive I have to give it 2 stars.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I really like this product!  Like the way it goes on and the way my lips feel.</li>
    <li> best lip balm ever.. doesn&#x27;t get all cakey</li>
    <li> Love this product, super moisturizing and it smells great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this lip treatment. Not only is was it overpriced it does not give the moisture or treatment you would expect from an expensive lip balm. I would recommend buying any drugstore lip balm/treatment over this product. Fresh is one of my favorite perfume and soap brands. I wanted to give the lip treatment a try after reading all the reviews and bought this small pack to see if I would like it. The stick part broke after 3 uses and my lips actually got drier after use. I had to go buy another lip balm to relieve the chapping! The Nivea Milk and Honey lip balm I bought was incredible!! and there&#x27;s always the dependable Carmex.  This item is a rip off and Fresh should be ashamed to sell such a worthless product at such a price! Some things are worth paying the extra bucks .....but not this product.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this, but it&#x27;s too expensive and no improvement on a chapstick. I like the scent, but am not impressed with the barely-there tint in the rose version. It feels good going on, but the product is way too soft. I think that&#x27;s why they put it in such a sturdy container. I took my clear version, scooped it out into a small jar of face cream, microwaved it for a few seconds and mixed it, then put it in the refrigerator. It will thicken up the cream to be good on hands. But I can buy a good hand cream for a lot less money too. I like the containers. I might try mixing the tinted version with a chapstick by melting them together in the microwave with the leftovers of a lipstick, then pour it back into the tubes and see how that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, it&#x27;s too much money for what you get and you&#x27;re better served with a chapstick.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time which is the reason why I&#x27;m giving it two stars. It is not a good product for me. I believe it caused me to have a minor allergic reaction and it seemed to dry out my lips the more I used it. I don&#x27;t really recommend this but just because it didn&#x27;t work for me doesn&#x27;t it mean it won&#x27;t work for you.</li>
    <li> I first tried this as a sample - this stuff is INCREDIBLE.  It has super healing qualities!!  If you have smile lines - try it on them at night.  You&#x27;ll be amazed at what this little lip treatment will dog!</li>
    <li> I am a &#x27;Fresh&#x27; fan, and wear the sugar lip treatment most of the time. I like the colors, but I really prefer the colorless.&lt;br /&gt;The sugar lip treatment is enriched with moisture-preserving sugar, hydrating precious oils, antioxidant-rich polyphenols, and essential SPF 15 protection. These lip treatments nourish, smooth, and protect my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am older and my lips become dry. I should say used to be. Since using the lip treatment they are moist &amp; comfortable all the time. I have Honey &amp; Petal &amp; they are great colors &amp; actually have staying power. I put the clear on when I go to bed and since I started I have not had any trouble with dry, cracked lips. The smell is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have heard that in warmer climates, Fresh lip treatment may melt, but we had a very warm summer, and my Fresh was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 11-13-13</li>
    <li> So glad I can find this product on Amazon!  Best lip balm ever!</li>
    <li> The staff is pretty nice and very moisture for lip. It is good to put on this before use lipsticks. However, the product came without the small box for the lip treatment and also the version of the product seems like not be the newest version.</li>
    <li> The is THE BEST lip balm on the market.  Yes, it is much more expensive but your lips will thank you. The condition, color and smoothness of my lips has improved 110% since using this product on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> Just love this lip balm. The scent is fresh and it is much cheaper than in Canada!&lt;br /&gt;Will buy one in every colour!!!</li>
    <li> I was beyond thrilled to discover that the mini Fresh Sugar Lip Treatment was the Sephora Beauty Insider birthday gift for February (the fabulous month of my birth).  Who doesn&#x27;t love a free birthday gift!?!?  Considering all the hype around this product, I had some pretty high expectations - Was this it? Had my Holy Grail lip product been sitting on the shelves of my local Sephora all this time?  Sadly - no ... I was not at all impressed with this product.  The balm itself is very sense and waxy, with a tragically non-glossy finish.  It does a decent job of coating the lips, but doesn&#x27;t absorb well - I&#x27;m left with a thick/goopy film for at least an hour application.  When the product finally does dissipate, I find that my lips aren&#x27;t even significantly moisturized.  These shortcomings, combined with the fact that the lemony scent reminds me of a kitchen cleaning product, means I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.  Note: the Rose version left a beautiful tint on the lips, but the disappointing formula just isn&#x27;t worth the money.    Read more at [...]</li>
    <li> This is the best for dry chapped lips both summer and winter!  I love it so much I have one for home and one for my purse and even purchased as Christmas gifts for my daughters!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give 5 stars for quality, but with the price, I had to drop down to 4 stars... Though I can&#x27;t complain as I got it free for my birthday from Sephora, but I would love to get this product again. This stuff works amazingly. I think most lip balms have something in them that dry your lips out after an hour or two so you have to keep reapplying... but not this stuff! This works so wonderfully and I only need to reapply 2 or 3 times in the whole day at the most! Love it and will be on the lookout for less pricey product with similar ingredients.</li>
    <li> The price is a little steep for this product, but I absolutely love this product. It lasts a long time and goes on really smooth.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my sister in law for Christmas.  She loves it and has already ordered more.  Great product and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I have finally found my perfect summer lip balm. I like the SPF and that it is unscented. It is moisturizing without being oily or greasy.The cap has an extra feature that screws it in place so there is no risk of it falling of in a purse or bag. Worth the price. I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the tinted versions although this one is perfect under my lip glosses and lipsticks.</li>
    <li> My girls love this lip treatment.&lt;br /&gt;It is the best....delivery was fast and all went well with that.&lt;br /&gt;They received thse as gifts one year and have been ordering them ever since.</li>
    <li> I went on another site to read the ingredients on this and I wasn&#x27;t impressed. It has retinyl palmitate. An ingredient I do not trust. I&#x27;ve been looking for more natural, healthy alternatives to my usual products lately. And in doing that, I&#x27;ve found out a lot of negative things about a lot of widely used ingredients. It ain&#x27;t easy to give up stuff that works, but I&#x27;d rather go on the hunt than stick with stuff that could damage my health. I&#x27;ve thrown out A Lot recently.  I don&#x27;t know how much of various things I have to use before they cause trouble, but I&#x27;d rather avoid them altogether and not risk it.</li>
    <li> A little spendy, but it has transformed my lips from dry and cracked to smooth. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it on Amazon; I went walked into a Sephora just to look around and ended up walking out with a Fresh sugar lip balm. At first, I was NOT going to spend over $20 on a lip balm, but after trying it, I do not regret it at all. The balm itself tasted great, and after two days of using it, my lips felt a lot smoother from being chapped prior to use. I definitely recommend this product to those who&#x27;d like a tasty way to cure those chapped lips!</li>
    <li> I also got the samples provided by Sephora and I must say it is a VERY good chap stick but it is not any better than any other high end lip moisturizer that can be gotten for cheaper. I prefer the L&#x27;Occitane Lip Balm (not the stick, but the one in the squeeze tube). The Pacifica Color Quench is also just as good and has better showing color, especially if you have darker lips. I am anemic and drink way too much alcohol and not enough water. I know problem chapping and only use specialty brands, if it was better I would buy it. Sugar doesn&#x27;t do anything particularly good for the price.</li>
