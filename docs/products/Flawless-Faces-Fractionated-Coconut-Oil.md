      <li>love it, i will be buying more.</li>
      <li>I have been using Flawless Faces Coconut Oil for about a month, I bought more because I love how smooth it feels and how soft and nurishing it makes my skin feel.</li>
      <li>I shined my daughters car interior up with this oil and to top it off</li>
      <li>I have to say I love doterra oils and scented oils and this fractionated coconut oil</li>
      <li>She was in love.</li>
      <li>Thanks for s great product.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with this product overall.</li>
      <li>I Love the Coconut  Oil</li>
      <li>I love coconut oil  and have used it for years.</li>
      <li>I recently was offered this Fractionated Coconut Oil from Flawless Faces for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a bottle.</li>
      <li>It is easy to dispense and does not leak.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its feather lite not greasy and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It also works as a great massage oil, and a carrier oil to combine your essential oils with for aromatherapy.</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin smooth and itch free.</li>
      <li>You can also use it as a massage oil or clean your cars interior.</li>
      <li>I love it because there is no smell making it easy to use either by itself or adding your favorite essential oils to it.  </li>
      <li>I use it fresh out of the shower, while my skin is still damp, so it soaks into my pores more easily since they are more open from the steam of the shower.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t feel greasy to me and it soaked in to my skin rather quick.  </li>
      <li>This is definitely worth buying.  </li>
      <li>Everything is so natural and refreshing.  </li>
      <li>Leaves no detectable residue once it&#x27;s absorbed.</li>
      <li>The oil is thick, high quality and perfect for giving a massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>like right after I do a deeper peel on my face, this will go right on after that treatment...  </li>
      <li>The other bottles of coconut oil I had tried were one fourth this size, so when I was given the opportunity to try this during a promotion in exchange for my honest feedback and review, I was more than happy to get such a large amount of this natural, miraculous skin remedy.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.</li>
      <li>While using it the second day I spilled it on my favorite sweatshirt</li>
      <li>Works well with essential oils and penetrates , love it</li>
      <li>It dries quickly and leaves you feeling soft.  </li>
      <li>Thanks again.</li>
      <li>What I really got it for, however, is to use on my skin.</li>
      <li>It absorbs into the skin, but not too fast.</li>
      <li>I could really feel the difference.</li>
      <li>Fractionated Coconut Oil comes in a very generous size of 16oz.  </li>
      <li>It is non-greasy or oily and really feels like you are putting water on your skin.  </li>
      <li>This oil can be used as a moisturizer or as a carrier oil and many other uses.  </li>
      <li>There are so many other applications for Coconut Oil!  </li>
      <li>This is the first time that I have ever received coconut in a dark bottle, which to me helps preserve it for a long shelf life, no damaging light to get to the product!  </li>
      <li>It leaves my hair very soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is very reasonably priced, I may have to order another bottle to mix with essential oils.  </li>
      <li>It is smooth and long lasting!</li>
      <li>My husband has a condition on his right hand really dry and cracks</li>
      <li>I am told it works better in lotions than it does for hard soap bars.</li>
      <li>I use it as a moisturizer for my face, especially when I want to really want to hydrate it,</li>
      <li>I have been using it for about a week now and my skin is so soft.</li>
      <li>The first thing I wanted to try it on was my dry cracked feet and hands.</li>

    <li> The Flawless Faces Fractionated Coconut Oil comes in a very generous size of 16oz.  I just press the cap and it pops open.  This oil can be used as a moisturizer or as a carrier oil and many other uses.  It didn&#x27;t feel greasy to me and it soaked in to my skin rather quick.  The bottle has not leaked I say that because I knocked it over once on my table.  Ofcourse thankfully I didn&#x27;t have the cap open.  It seems to do what it claims and I have been very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**  I received this product for free  in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I have really bad eczema, especially during winter months. I recently started using coconut oil, under lotion, to help moisturize and soften my skin. It&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs quickly, which are wonderful. It&#x27;s also unscented, so I don&#x27;t walk around smelling like a coconut (not that it&#x27;s a bad thing) This is a large, 16 ounce bottle and a little goes a long way. I use it fresh out of the shower, while my skin is still damp, so it soaks into my pores more easily since they are more open from the steam of the shower. The other bottles of coconut oil I had tried were one fourth this size, so when I was given the opportunity to try this during a promotion in exchange for my honest feedback and review, I was more than happy to get such a large amount of this natural, miraculous skin remedy. It also works as a great massage oil, and a carrier oil to combine your essential oils with for aromatherapy. I am very happy with this product overall.</li>
    <li> I use coconut oil in recipes for soap making and have not tried fractionated coconut oil in that process yet. I am told it works better in lotions than it does for hard soap bars. What I really got it for, however, is to use on my skin. It soothes my psoriasis. This brand from Flawless Faces is a good one with a pleasant smell - it&#x27;s odor free! I tend to have allergic reactions to strong perfume smells and am so thrilled that I don&#x27;t have to worry about sinus headaches after using this great oil. Leaves my skin smooth and itch free.</li>
    <li> I received this in 2 days and it was well packaged. I have to say I love doterra oils and scented oils and this fractionated coconut oil is a must to use with my oils. My husband has a condition on his right hand really dry and cracks and we have been using the coconut oil every night and it is amazing how much better his hand looks. Its feather lite not greasy and easy to apply. While using it the second day I spilled it on my favorite sweatshirt and it didn&#x27;t even leave a stain I was so relieved. I also use the fractionated coconut oil mixed with oils in roller and spray bottles for my convenience. You can also use it as a massage oil or clean your cars interior. I shined my daughters car interior up with this oil and to top it off it smelled great. She was in love. I was able to get this product at a discount during a promotion and am happy to share my experience with it.</li>
    <li> Works well with essential oils and penetrates , love it</li>
    <li> I love this product! It arrived as promised with a pump and leaves my skin feeling soft...not greasy!  I also use it to dilute essential oils so I wanted a product that didn&#x27;t have a smell of it&#x27;s own.  This is definitely worth buying.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love coconut oil  and have used it for years. I recently was offered this Fractionated Coconut Oil from Flawless Faces for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a bottle. The first thing I wanted to try it on was my dry cracked feet and hands. I have been using it for about a week now and my skin is so soft. The nice thing is the coconut oil soaks in and isn&#x27;t greasy like most lotions are. I also took it to my massage this last weekend and asked her to try it out on me. She usually uses a coconut oil anyways, so I didn&#x27;t think this would be too weird. She actually said that this coconut oil was nicer than the last one she had been using.  I told her that I was going to bring it in for each appointment...lol. I definitely recommend this Fractionated Coconut Oil from Flawless Faces for anyone who wants a great oil with many great uses.</li>
    <li> I Love the Coconut  Oil it makes my Caramel Skin Look Flawless. I will recommend it to my friends. Thanks again.😆&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kimberley  Ryles  13 June 2015 Saturday</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome massage oil. It absorbs into the skin, but not too fast. Leaves no detectable residue once it&#x27;s absorbed. Holds it&#x27;s slipperyness well too. And has zero scent. I will be continuing to buy this one.</li>
    <li> From the moment I opened my box I knew I was going to love Flawless Faces Fractionated Coconut Oil.  This is the first time that I have ever received coconut in a dark bottle, which to me helps preserve it for a long shelf life, no damaging light to get to the product!  I love it because there is no smell making it easy to use either by itself or adding your favorite essential oils to it.

It comes with a 100% money back guarantee if not satisfied, but trust me you will never have to use that.  Great for giving as a gift also.</li>
    <li> I love this productI mostly, I keep it in my shower and use it as a moisturizer while my skin is still damp...  I use it again after I get dried a bit... It is like silk and absorbs beautifully...  It never transfers to my clothing, which I appreciate...  I also use this for a variety of other things...  There are so many other applications for Coconut Oil!  I use it as a moisturizer for my face, especially when I want to really want to hydrate it, like right after I do a deeper peel on my face, this will go right on after that treatment...  I use it on my hands prior to doing dishes to protect them a little bit...  It comes off, of course, but my hands have had a little treatment, then I reapply...  Sometimes, apply heavily on my hands and wear cotton gloves to bed...  It&#x27;s a wonderful scalp and hair treatment...  There are days I put a thick layer on my hair and massage my scalp, leave it on overnight, then wash hair...  It also works to take sticky labels off!  A product I love having!</li>
    <li> It is smooth and long lasting!</li>
    <li> great oil!  Perfect packaging, and fast shipping.  I will be buying this again!</li>
    <li> I have been using Flawless Faces Coconut Oil for about a month, I bought more because I love how smooth it feels and how soft and nurishing it makes my skin feel.

    <li> Love it!  Works just as described. So many uses. Thanks for s great product.</li>
    <li> Fractionated Coconut Oil by Flawless Faces comes in a very nice (and huge) bottle.  It would be a good gift.  It is easy to dispense and does not leak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately mixed some with lavender essential oil.  It blended perfectly.  The oil is thick, high quality and perfect for giving a massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry hair and am always trying different oils and moisturizers.  When I used this on my hair I could really feel the difference. I like that this oil is odorless, this allows me to leave it in my hair a long time, even overnight!  It leaves my hair very soft and manageable.  I will definitely be using this as a hair moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very reasonably priced, I may have to order another bottle to mix with essential oils.  I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Use it to mix with lavender oil.</li>
