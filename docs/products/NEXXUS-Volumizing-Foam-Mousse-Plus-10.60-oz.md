<ol>
      <li>Great foam styler!</li>
      <li>The end results are great.</li>
      <li>great product and service</li>
      <li>This is great.</li>
      <li>Very good, i love it.</li>
      <li>I would have Loved it, if I could have gotten it.</li>
      <li>Just the Superior Hold, which I do not like.</li>
      <li>Love this mousse!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to use after washing your hair, making it easy to style;  I don&#x27;t like the way my hair/head itches afterwards.</li>
      <li>product has a light to non-existent scent so it won&#x27;t interfere with your favorite perfume or cologne.</li>
      <li>My favorite mousse because it is Alcohol free.  </li>
      <li>She called me two days later to tell me she loved the product!</li>
      <li>It is easy to use, and blow-dries well.  </li>
      <li>is an easy product to use.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
      <li>This is a favorite product of mine because it is fast and easy to use, produces great results, is reasonably priced, available at most stores, and does exactly what it promises with some added benefits that aren&#x27;t listed on the label.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the price for sure.</li>
      <li>Picture of product indicates Alchol Free - product received was not Alchol Free.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m considering shaving my head because i loved the old version of this mousse and do not think I can deal with my hair without it.  </li>
      <li>THIS product, however, is the ONLY volumizing mousse I have been able to find that gives my hair a nice lift/bounce without any greasy residue feeling.</li>
      <li>I received the NEW FORMULATION (PINKISH BOTTLE WITH LIGHT CAP).  </li>
      <li>I am very happy with this product, not able to obtain it locally.</li>
      <li>I am keenly aware of this and am doing whatever I can to keep it looking volumized.</li>
      <li>Our first order contained a DOA unit.</li>
      <li>Great mousse, hard to find now!</li>
      <li>I have fine hair that is sun damaged which only seems to complicate my hair problems.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>As it turns out, I really like the Mousse, and would buy it again.  </li>
      <li>It is much heavier.</li>
      <li>Consequently, I only use it when I NEED to look special.</li>
      <li>Also since my hair is fine, it doesn&#x27;t take much to weigh it down.  </li>
      <li>I comb my hair and blow dry on a cool setting giving attention to the root area.</li>
      <li>The new formulation is available on amazon for half this price, so no reason to order from this listing.  </li>
      <li>I like the fact that it can be used on dry hair as most mousses won&#x27;t work with dry hair.</li>
      <li>NEXXUS BRING THE OLD FORMULATION</li>
      <li>This mousse is light to the touch but at the same time, adds volume and fullness to my otherwise limp hair.  </li>
      <li>I nomally use this on freshly shampooed towel dried hair.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just the reality of getting older, or if it&#x27;s due to the fact that I was dieting, but over the past year, my hair has gotten significantly thinner than it used to be.</li>
      <li>Not enough pouf for my fine but thick hair.</li>
      <li>so much so that I haven&#x27;t felt the need to continue looking for other volumizing mousse products.</li>

<li> so much so that I haven&#x27;t felt the need to continue looking for other volumizing mousse products.</li>
<li> I have fine hair and it adds lots of volume without looking fake or drying my hair.  </li>
<li> This product makes your hair very manageable while not getting heavy like some other products.  </li>
<li> My hair without any volumizer is very flat and devoid of volume.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
<li> Defeats the purpose of using mousse when it dry&#x27;s out your hair and leaves it brittle.  </li>
<li> This can also be used on dry hair to give hair &#x27;lift&#x27;.</li>
<li> BTW the new formulation sucks.  </li>
<li> Sometimes I dry my hair thoroughly and sometimes I leave it slightly damp and let my hair air dry.</li>
<li> I have tried other like products</li>
<li> made hair too stiff, and it didn&#x27;t say whether to use it on dry or wet hair.</li>
<li> I shake the can vigorously and pointing the can upside down dispense an amount of mousse about the size of a tennis ball or less.</li>
<li> My hair does not feel stiff, it is shiny, and this leaves no build-up or stickiness on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
<li> Living in Florida where my hair suffers sun and surf damage, I can truly appreciate that Nexxus Mousse Plus has no alcohol to dry my hair further.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if it looked greasy to others?</li>

    <li> Great foam styler! Our first order contained a DOA unit. The seller sent a replacement as we recycled the defective unit.</li>
    <li> This product makes your hair very manageable while not getting heavy like some other products.  And it&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just the reality of getting older, or if it&#x27;s due to the fact that I was dieting, but over the past year, my hair has gotten significantly thinner than it used to be. I am keenly aware of this and am doing whatever I can to keep it looking volumized. I used several different products, all of which gave my hair a \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; texture. I&#x27;m not sure if it looked greasy to others? But it felt greasy to me. THIS product, however, is the ONLY volumizing mousse I have been able to find that gives my hair a nice lift/bounce without any greasy residue feeling. I like it a lot, so much so that I haven&#x27;t felt the need to continue looking for other volumizing mousse products. It&#x27;s worth the price for sure.</li>
    <li> This mousse works for my hair!</li>
    <li> I would have Loved it, if I could have gotten it. I guess you do not make it anymore. Just the Superior Hold, which I do not like. It is much heavier. Thank you!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to use after washing your hair, making it easy to style;  I don&#x27;t like the way my hair/head itches afterwards. Consequently, I only use it when I NEED to look special.</li>
    <li> Picture of product indicates Alchol Free - product received was not Alchol Free.</li>
    <li> great product and service</li>
    <li> Love this mousse!  I have fine hair and it adds lots of volume without looking fake or drying my hair.  It is easy to use, and blow-dries well.  This one is a keeper...</li>
    <li> Living in Florida where my hair suffers sun and surf damage, I can truly appreciate that Nexxus Mousse Plus has no alcohol to dry my hair further.  Also since my hair is fine, it doesn&#x27;t take much to weigh it down.  This mousse is light to the touch but at the same time, adds volume and fullness to my otherwise limp hair.  I have tried other like products but I always come back to Nexxus.</li>
    <li> Very good, i love it. Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Nexxus Mousse Plus for quite some time now. I have fine hair that is sun damaged which only seems to complicate my hair problems. My hair without any volumizer is very flat and devoid of volume.&lt;br /&gt;This is an easy product to use. I nomally use this on freshly shampooed towel dried hair. I shake the can vigorously and pointing the can upside down dispense an amount of mousse about the size of a tennis ball or less. I  dip my fingertips in the mousse and apply it to the root area running from the front and sides to the back. I comb my hair and blow dry on a cool setting giving attention to the root area. Sometimes I dry my hair thoroughly and sometimes I leave it slightly damp and let my hair air dry. This can also be used on dry hair to give hair &#x27;lift&#x27;. I like the fact that it can be used on dry hair as most mousses won&#x27;t work with dry hair. The end results are great. I&#x27;ve used this on a shag cut and now my hair is shoulder length. I have plenty of volume which stands up to humid weather and windy winter weather. My hair does not feel stiff, it is shiny, and this leaves no build-up or stickiness on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;This product has a light to non-existent scent so it won&#x27;t interfere with your favorite perfume or cologne. This is a favorite product of mine because it is fast and easy to use, produces great results, is reasonably priced, available at most stores, and does exactly what it promises with some added benefits that aren&#x27;t listed on the label.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time. Works so well.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps hair where you want it to stay.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product, not able to obtain it locally.</li>
    <li> My favorite mousse because it is Alcohol free.  Defeats the purpose of using mousse when it dry&#x27;s out your hair and leaves it brittle.  This is great.</li>
    <li> I received this product by mistake.  I thought I ordered another product by Nexxus.  The distributing company was understanding and  helpful.  As it turns out, I really like the Mousse, and would buy it again.  I had ordered two, and gave one to a friend.  She called me two days later to tell me she loved the product!</li>
    <li> made hair too stiff, and it didn&#x27;t say whether to use it on dry or wet hair. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I received the NEW FORMULATION (PINKISH BOTTLE WITH LIGHT CAP).  BUYER BEWARE.  The new formulation is available on amazon for half this price, so no reason to order from this listing.  BTW the new formulation sucks.  I&#x27;m considering shaving my head because i loved the old version of this mousse and do not think I can deal with my hair without it.  NEXXUS BRING THE OLD FORMULATION BACK PLEASE.</li>
    <li> Not enough pouf for my fine but thick hair.</li>
    <li> Great mousse, hard to find now!</li>
