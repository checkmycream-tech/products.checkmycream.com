      <li>I have tried many of the Frizz Ease products.  </li>
      <li>i love this product.</li>
      <li>Fast shipment and great product to stop the frizz.</li>
      <li>i love it .it turned my hair curly and bouncy.</li>
      <li>i also learned that putting it in and blow drying it out adds volume and hold curl better from rollers or a curling iron.</li>
      <li>haven&#x27;t found anything I like better.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave that crunchy feel that most products do.</li>
      <li>I love the Frizz Ease line and I use the shampoo and conditioner along with this mousse.</li>
      <li>I used to use a Redken product that seems to have been discontinued, so I was glad to find that this does a comparable job.  </li>
      <li>many others have said, this mousse</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this mousse for years and love it.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>so I thought this would be even better.  </li>
      <li>The price is fabulous and works much better than salon products that I have tried.</li>
      <li>, my ends were curling in before I started using the round brush and the hair held curl much better :D</li>
      <li>Good mousse does exactly what it says it does, John Frieda products are pretty good quality for a decent price in my book!</li>
      <li>I use to use this and loved it, but this new formula coats my hair with an oily wax.</li>
      <li>However, I was in a pinch one day and this was what was available.</li>
      <li>This runs in the $7-$8 range at a brick and mortar so the price is great, &lt;$5, plus I got an extra discount for subscribing.  </li>
      <li>Smooth and luxuriant foam.</li>
      <li>I have lightly curly hair and have been using John Frieda Curl Perfecting Spray.  </li>
      <li>holds curls very well and feels and smells nice.</li>
      <li>This product is great, totally keeps my hair curly without frizz!</li>
      <li>Other than that, I love the hold it gives and it smells great.</li>
      <li>Been using this product for many years on my string straight baby fine hair</li>
      <li>This stuff, when used after just about any leave-in conditioning spray, does great things for my dry, curly hair.</li>
      <li>Best mousse I have every used, This mousse does not leave your have crunchy, My curls are soft and frizz free all day long even on windy days</li>
      <li>This works great and keeping my curls together, minus the frizz.</li>
      <li>Sweet customer service</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t imagine how this product got such good reviews.  </li>
      <li>If you have thinning curly hair, it&#x27;s a good product, puts the volume back</li>
      <li>This mouse is fantastic for my hair routine right now.</li>
      <li>I put it on every night after I towel dry my hair and in the morning my hair feels super soft and has the perfect amount of curls.</li>
      <li>If you have short naturally-curly/wavy hair and need something to \\&quot;direct\\&quot; the curl into a reasonable hairstyle, this is a great product to use.  </li>
      <li>Like many similar products, this mousse moisturizes a bit, and it holds the hair in place better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>and I have to curl it unnaturally to get a curl that falls out really quick.  </li>
      <li>I know, I have used it up way too quickly.  </li>
      <li>It keeps the curls soft and is the best frizz reducer I have used to date, which speaks very highly of John Frieda considering I live in a very humid climate.</li>
      <li>This does a good job of keeping frizz in check, though compared to the Pantene Curl Shaping Gel it doesn&#x27;t define my curls as well or hold them as long.</li>
      <li>sections off the very top, twist them a few times by hand, pin each one on top of my head</li>
      <li>(I don&#x27;t use it in the summer; because, like many other hair and face products with a strong scent, it attracts mosquitoes!  </li>
      <li>I have used cheaper non curl hair mousse and had success</li>
      <li>so for me the reduced frizz wins out.</li>
      <li>The only thing I mind is the very strong fragrance.</li>
      <li>Then I let it air dry, and my hair is wicked cute!</li>
      <li>It is much lighter and works better than the new brand.</li>
      <li>It keeps curls soft and frizz free for a while.</li>
      <li>Arrived so fast!</li>
      <li>Good holding of hair without being too stiff</li>
      <li>I have fine, thin hair that is also naturally curly and this lightweight mousse does a great job of both boosting my volume and keeping it frizz-free.  </li>
      <li>The scent is fine, it wore several hours pretty well.</li>
      <li>and it certainly didn&#x27;t revive my curls.  </li>
      <li>I like the mousse in the silver can better than the new blue can</li>
      <li>Smells very industrial.</li>
      <li>I have very curly, ringlet curly, hair and this</li>
      <li>This mousse works very well.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my hair in far better condition and while it may not add curl, it definitely doesn&#x27;t make my hair straight.</li>
      <li>I use this so much</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice much of anything</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for YEARS, but suddenly it&#x27;s no longer available at the drugstore.</li>
      <li>I really like this product for my wavy/curly hair, but it&#x27;s really aggravating when I can&#x27;t get any mousse to come out at 6:30 in the morning</li>
      <li>you should really buy it.</li>
      <li>I really like this mousse.</li>
      <li>I have straight hair.</li>
      <li>I used crimper and it worked well leaving my hairs curly for the  whole evening.</li>
      <li>Perhaps if your hair isn&#x27;t real dry like mine, it would work better.</li>
      <li>I can really feel this product every time, no matter how I use it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Leaves hair soft not crunchy.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t hold my Mediterranean curls. Smells very industrial.</li>
    <li> This is the only mousse that really works for me!  It adds body and holds a style.  I even bring it with me when I go to get my hair cut or colored, so that my stylist uses it when she styles me at the end of my appointment.  Although she works with the supposed &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; products of the salon, I don&#x27;t think they work as well as Frizz Ease!</li>
    <li> in summer my hair was really wavy, almost curly, but now that it&#x27;s winter, and so dry outside it doesn&#x27;t curl at all and I have to curl it unnaturally to get a curl that falls out really quick.  I just used this and diffused and then used a round brush to add curl to the dry hair, my ends were curling in before I started using the round brush and the hair held curl much better :D I then used moisture barrier hairspray to finish</li>
    <li> Holds the curl, no frizz and no crunch. The price is fabulous and works much better than salon products that I have tried.</li>
    <li> i have naturat curly hair so i bought it for this specifically. it makes my curls soft and loose and not crunchy. i also learned that putting it in and blow drying it out adds volume and hold curl better from rollers or a curling iron. i use it on all my styles now!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this mousse for years and love it.  I have fine, thin hair that is also naturally curly and this lightweight mousse does a great job of both boosting my volume and keeping it frizz-free.  And it&#x27;s not sticky or plastic looking on your hair either - very natural and soft after styling.  Happy to find it here at such a great price!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t imagine how this product got such good reviews.  I have naturally curly hair and tried it this morning. It left my hair very dry, with less curl than normal, and wispy.  My hair felt thin and looked awful.    I would highly recommend Nexxus&#x27; Youth Renewal: http://www.amazon.com/Nexxus-Spray-Youth-Renewal-Plump/dp/B00AE07GX0/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1424635247&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;nexxus+youth+renewal+hair  Or, you can get it at your local CVS.   It leaves my hair in far better condition and while it may not add curl, it definitely doesn&#x27;t make my hair straight.</li>
    <li> I put this in my hair after washing and conditioning it as I hoped to soften and defrizz my dry hair.  I didn&#x27;t really notice much of anything and it certainly didn&#x27;t revive my curls.  At best it added a bit of conditioning to my hair.  I was hoping to use this stuff as my only leave-in conditioner, but I ended up using my usual 4 products plus this.  Disappointed.  Perhaps if your hair isn&#x27;t real dry like mine, it would work better.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for many years on my string straight baby fine hair and I get great volume with out coating, buildup or stickiness. The formula has changed somewhat over the years but it is still my go-to for volumizing.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the only mousse that makes my curly hair look natural. and not crunchy. It also almost eliminates my frizz.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky or crunchy and it actually works.  I&#x27;m on the subscribe and save dealio I use this so much</li>
    <li> Best mousse I have every used, This mousse does not leave your have crunchy, My curls are soft and frizz free all day long even on windy days I do not end up with an afro. I use this mousse daily and have been for almost 1 year. I would highly recommend to anyone with curly hair.</li>
    <li> How have I not found this earlier?  I have long, straight, naturally blond hair.  This stuff keeps flyaways in check and makes hair so silky soft!  Doesn&#x27;t feel like a styling mousse (it&#x27;s so gentle), but holds curls from rollers and curling iron beautifully!  I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> It works, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well on my wife&#x27;s hair like other name brands.</li>
    <li> This mousse is great for giving you sexy curls without a lot of that unwanted crunch. I like to use it while my hair is still a little wet from my shower, and then scrunch the curls up, and put hair claws or duckbill hair clips at the top of my head to keep that area from getting flat. Then I let it air dry, and my hair is wicked cute!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got naturally long loosely curled hair. This works great and keeping my curls together, minus the frizz. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve migrated through many different mousses over the years trying to find the right one for my long, curly hair. I tend to switch my &amp;#34;favorite&amp;#34; every few years; maybe my hair needs a change or maybe I just do! This mouse is fantastic for my hair routine right now. I usually shower at night and put a curl cream in while it dries. In the morning, I add in this mousse, and after about 20 minutes, my curls are dry, defined, non-frizzy, and non-crunchy! I&#x27;d definitely recommend this mousse for anyone with wavy to curly hair.</li>
    <li> If you have short naturally-curly/wavy hair and need something to \\&quot;direct\\&quot; the curl into a reasonable hairstyle, this is a great product to use.  I don&#x27;t know about the \\&quot;frizz\\&quot; part, since that is not my problem.  I used to use a Redken product that seems to have been discontinued, so I was glad to find that this does a comparable job.  Nice fragrance, too, without being overpowering.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and my number one issue is frizz.  I have used cheaper non curl hair mousse and had success so I thought this would be even better.  Honestly I feel my hair is frizzier than it was before.  This one is a miss for me.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t purchase online, the bottle didn&#x27;t work once it was delivered. Waste of $ :(</li>
    <li> Excellent shipping, excellent product!  Holds well.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, curly hair and this is the only product that works for me. I put it on every night after I towel dry my hair and in the morning my hair feels super soft and has the perfect amount of curls.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair and this has a good hold without being crunchy.  When purchased through the subscribe and save program the price is great!</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for my hair at all - it made it frizzier than no product at all and completely flat, not to mention sticky and gross. Threw it out.</li>
    <li> I bought this around three months ago and after a handful of uses, the bottle stopped dispensing product. I bought a second, thinking it was one faulty bottle but still worth a try because I like the product and he price is fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same thing happened. And, they can&#x27;t be returned.</li>
    <li> Does its job, absolutely love it! Have tried various other mousse before, but this works just like it says it will.</li>
    <li> Better than their other mousse. This product tames the frizz, enhances my curls, &amp; is a great deal for the amount provided. I highly suggest the product.</li>
    <li> I frustrates me that all hair care products have changed their formulas and all seem &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; and heavy. I use to use this and loved it, but this new formula coats my hair with an oily wax.</li>
    <li> Good mousse does exactly what it says it does, John Frieda products are pretty good quality for a decent price in my book!</li>
    <li> If you have thinning curly hair, it&#x27;s a good product, puts the volume back</li>
    <li> in todays economy this is a product i can afford and I like this product for the way it seals in just enough curls</li>
    <li> Arrived so fast! This product is great, totally keeps my hair curly without frizz!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and I normally do not use mousse. However, I was in a pinch one day and this was what was available. I love it! It does not dry out my hair like other brands and it leaves my curls naturally and full! Love it!</li>
    <li> This does a good job of keeping frizz in check, though compared to the Pantene Curl Shaping Gel it doesn&#x27;t define my curls as well or hold them as long. I don&#x27;t mind the looser curls and having to re-style the next morning though, so for me the reduced frizz wins out. I could probably improve hold with a hairspray but I have low porosity hair and prefer to use as little product as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As many others have said, this mousse *can* make your hair a bit crunchy, but I&#x27;ve found that I can almost entirely eliminate crunch by applying a small amount of oil to my hair before I apply the mousse. As a bonus it comes in a TSA-compliant 2oz can that I&#x27;ve always found pretty easy to track down in drugstores. I hate checking bags when I fly so being able to bring a travel-size version of this in my carry-on is a godsend.</li>
    <li> Everything my perm needs to look great with no blow drying.</li>
    <li> This mousse helps to keep your curls in longer.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to style every day.</li>
    <li> Smooth and luxuriant foam. Speedy delivery. Sweet customer service</li>
    <li> I prefer a lighter, softer, natural texture to my hair.  I can really feel this product every time, no matter how I use it.</li>
    <li> Best mousse for my curly 3c hair!</li>
    <li> This mousse works very well.  I&#x27;m very happy with it and will buy more when I run out.  It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> This item I have used for years and like it because it contains no alcohol which is good for any one who colors their hair.  A little bit goes a long way.,</li>
    <li> I have medium curls...not wavy, and not tight curls.  I use this and it curls better and looks the same late in the day as it did in the morning.  I use this in combination with curl spray, then this, gel, then dry with a diffuser.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mouse for my curly/frizzy hair, in combination with curl locking hairspray it works great, even though it&#x27;s a little expensive .. haven&#x27;t found anything I like better.</li>
    <li> This is the best mousse I&#x27;ve tried for my hair. Takes it from crazy frizzy poofy to pretty and wavy.</li>
    <li> Okay so I was getting annoyed because I have flatness on the top of my head, so it looked kinda weird since I have curly hair. And I&#x27;m a volume-loving girl. So, I tried something new with this mousse. I applied my leave in after my shower as usual. Then I didn&#x27;t flip my hair, but I just scrunched it up with this mousse. Then I just applied moraccon oil on my ends. I usually wait an hour, then go to sleep. I wake up, and my hair looked so good! I love this mousse! My MOM likes my hair now, and she never used to complement me! By the way, I have 3a/3b curls.</li>
    <li> I have tried many of the Frizz Ease products.  I can&#x27;t find this product in my local stores anymore Frizz Ease has changed the product line and the new mousse doesn&#x27;t work as well as this does.  It is much lighter and works better than the new brand. I like the mousse in the silver can better than the new blue can</li>
    <li> does not hold the curls as tightly as i thought it would.</li>
    <li> leaves wet hair , the product came without lid</li>
    <li> It did not work as well on my naturally curl as I thought. Maybe the south&#x27;s humitidy is a bit much for Frizz Ease.</li>
    <li> Works well for curls. Does the job of keeping hair strands tidy.</li>
    <li> Actually this was not what I originally wanted to order. I did not pay attention but I like the product anyway.  I would order it again. It did not leave an oily feeling and it did not cake up on my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It keeps curls soft and frizz free for a while. Unlike other products that leave your hair stiff and dry, this reviver styling mousse leaves your curls soft and frizz free. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have dry, frizzy hair and this my hair soft and tamed. Doesn&#x27;t leave that crunchy feel that most products do.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb! I have very curly, ringlet curly, hair and this puts it in its place all day long. I flip my head upside down, work this all the way through, pull a pick through it all, and scrunch the bottom of the hair. Flip back up, shake, and DO NOT TOUCH for the rest of the day and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
    <li> Hard to go wrong here, this tames hair in even the worst climate conditions.  I know, I have used it up way too quickly.  It does exactly what it says, no more, no less.  I recommend this Firzz-Ease.  Try to find it on sale if you can, it tends to be expensive.</li>
    <li> I am Puerto Rican and find it  hard to find a mousse that makes my curls pretty but not crusty and hard. I dont have super thick hair but it has a lot of frizz.  I needed a mousse to make the frizz go away but also give me the volume and curls, with out the wet look or weighing it down.  This is the one, trust me I&#x27;ve been through several.</li>
    <li> Weighs down my hair a lot more than other products. I attempted to switch when my local stores stopped offering Tresemme&#x27;s curly hair product, and this one just isn&#x27;t for me. The scent is fine, it wore several hours pretty well. I&#x27;ve used for about 5 months with the matching shampoo and conditioner - all products were too heavy for my hair. My curls are not tight and my hair is not super thick.</li>
    <li> Like many similar products, this mousse moisturizes a bit, and it holds the hair in place better than others I&#x27;ve tried. The only thing I mind is the very strong fragrance. (I don&#x27;t use it in the summer; because, like many other hair and face products with a strong scent, it attracts mosquitoes!  Ever wonder why bugs swarm around your head?)</li>
    <li> I live in Louisiana....love it!</li>
    <li> Fast shipment and great product to stop the frizz.</li>
    <li> The first bottle I threw away nearly full, because no more would come out.  I assumed it was our fault - maybe the teen hadn&#x27;t shaken the bottle properly, and we used up all the schtuff that makes the mousse come out.  Yeah, no.  The next two bottles are exactly the same, and the second bottle&#x27;s nozzle actually cracked just from pressing on it with normal pressure.  I really like this product for my wavy/curly hair, but it&#x27;s really aggravating when I can&#x27;t get any mousse to come out at 6:30 in the morning and it&#x27;s too late to blow out my hair and I haven&#x27;t had my caffeine and I&#x27;m (literally) cursing a little plastic nozzle.  I&#x27;ve never had this problem with any other brand of mousse I&#x27;ve used the past 20+ years, and I&#x27;m actually not a complete idiot, so I really believe there&#x27;s something wrong with the design of this bottle/nozzle.</li>
    <li> My hais isnt naturally curly but this mousee worked good for them. I used crimper and it worked well leaving my hairs curly for the  whole evening. It doesnt stick hairs together, and dont make a fluffy mess. Very nice stuff.</li>
    <li> i love it .it turned my hair curly and bouncy. i love this product. you should really buy it.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price.  I love this mousse but the price was a little hefty for my pocketbook until I found it here on Amazon.  This runs in the $7-$8 range at a brick and mortar so the price is great, &lt;$5, plus I got an extra discount for subscribing.  This mousse works fabulously on my long curly hair.  It keeps the curls soft and is the best frizz reducer I have used to date, which speaks very highly of John Frieda considering I live in a very humid climate.</li>
    <li> Wow does this stuff have some hold!  Very little goes a long way.  I have super curly hair and using this not only makes it straight when I blow dry but it stays that way.</li>
    <li> I love the Frizz Ease line and I use the shampoo and conditioner along with this mousse. I really like this mousse. It leaves my hair shiny and defines my curls well while keeping frizz out. It works well when you use it with a hairdryer and diffuser. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it can dry a bit hard, and I wish it was a little softer to the touch. Other than that, I love the hold it gives and it smells great.</li>
    <li> I have straight hair. It never holds a curl, unless I use the frizz ease curl boost. It keeps my hair as I originally styled it, instead of falling out after 20 minutes like other mousses.</li>
    <li> I have lightly curly hair and have been using John Frieda Curl Perfecting Spray.  Decided to try the mousse and I am really impressed.  Definitely brings out the curl.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for YEARS, but suddenly it&#x27;s no longer available at the drugstore. Since I&#x27;ve been unable to find it, I&#x27;ve tried at least five other styling products for curly hair -- much more expensive -- and NONE of them are as good!  This product brings out the curl, gives you styling control, but doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.  And it isn&#x27;t drying. Thank heaven it&#x27;s on Amazon!  Please don&#x27;t take it away!</li>
    <li> I purchased John Frieda Frizz-Ease Curl Boosting Mousse in a travel size to take on a trip.  I&#x27;ve tried various styling&lt;br /&gt;products......this is by far the best.  This mousse adds texture and volume to my hair with no frizz and plenty of shine.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST mousse I have ever used!!</li>
    <li> This stuff, when used after just about any leave-in conditioning spray, does great things for my dry, curly hair. My hair naturally wants to curl into ringlets, but it&#x27;s so heavy and dry, that if I don&#x27;t use anything on it and let it dry naturally (or gods-forbid I blow-dry without product) it becomes an oddly kinky and wavy mess with a bunch of fly-aways. Many years ago, I used to get perms because I thought dry, kinky waves were all that my hair could do naturally. Then I stumbled onto a magic secret: leave-in spray conditioner, followed by frizz ease mousse on quite-damp hair. I pull some small-ish (1&amp;#34; or so?) sections off the very top, twist them a few times by hand, pin each one on top of my head (only 2-3 sections on each side), which allows the bottom layers to air-dry into a glorious mass of heavenly ringlets. I keep them the pinned sections up anywhere from 10 minutes to hours (if I forget about them), but in a pinch 5 minutes seems to work well enough. The longer the sections are held up, the more rigid the ringlets are when they come down. 10-15 minutes is about ideal for very natural looking ringlets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have mentioned it makes their hair crunchy. I don&#x27;t understand that. This can give me crunchy hair if I use a LOT of it. Occasionally I dispense too much product, suddenly finding myself with a tennis-ball sized mass of foam in my hand. I&#x27;ve learned to just throw out half of that, because using that much definitely makes my hair hard. My hair has been chin-length, shoulder-length, mid-back length. The only time I&#x27;ve ever felt the need to vary the amount of foam I use was when I hacked it all off up to my ears. Somewhere between a jaw-breaker and a billiard ball is the perfect amount for just about any length of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product for at least 10 years now, possibly 20? It&#x27;s divine.</li>
    <li> holds curls very well and feels and smells nice.</li>
    <li> Good holding of hair without being too stiff</li>
