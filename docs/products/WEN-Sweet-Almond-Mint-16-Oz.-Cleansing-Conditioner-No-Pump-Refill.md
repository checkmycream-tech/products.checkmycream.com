### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great Product!</li>
      <li>Excellent product.</li>
      <li>Good luck keeping this shampoo away from your daughters!</li>
      <li>Using Wen has made my hair beautiful and shiny again.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy with the product.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s great to buy on here</li>
      <li>Still LOVE WEN!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s that good.</li>
      <li>I love wen!  </li>
      <li>Love WEN!</li>
      <li>as opposed to &#x27;excellent&#x27; is because I had previously bought the WEN Summer Mango and coconut cleansing conditioner and it worked wonders and absolutley loved my medium thick-long-volumunous-dry hair</li>
      <li>WEN hair products have made a huge difference on my hair!</li>
      <li>Oh well! : )</li>
      <li>but this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>The tea tree is more &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34;, as it should be, and the Pomegranate was just ok.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t get my hair clean.  </li>
      <li>However, this Wen, Sweet Almond Mint dries my hair.</li>
      <li>I live in a very dry climate and this is the best Shampoo/Conditioner I have used. !</li>
      <li>From the first time I tried Wen, I determined to never use anything else to clean my hair.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEN ordered From WEN website first Ingredients:  Water, aloe vera gel, gylcerin, chamomile extract, cherry bark extract, calendula extract…...</li>
      <li>first ingredients:  water, glycerin, acetyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol,stearamidopropyl dimethylamine…</li>
      <li>This Cleansing conditioner brand is my absolute savior!</li>
      <li>, now the WEN Sweet Almond Mint is created for all types of hair so I decided to experiment since I am new to WEN products I like trying new smells, but unfortunatley Sweet Almond Mint does not hydrate my hair as much as the Summer mango.</li>
      <li>My coarse, curly hair is smooth and shiny.</li>
      <li>The only reason my rating is only an &#x27;okay&#x27;</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it</li>
      <li>At first I thought I was not using it correctly so the next time I went EXACTLY by the directions on the bottle same effect.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny I spent!</li>
      <li>The bottle looks essentially identical to previously ordered product from WEN website, however, the ingredient list differs significantly.  </li>
      <li>The first time I used it, my hair felt dry and lifeless the second day.</li>
      <li>Love what it does for dry , thin, wavy hair</li>

    <li> The bottle looks essentially identical to previously ordered product from WEN website, however, the ingredient list differs significantly.  Amazon was helpful with the return, however, I wanted to inform others not to make the same mistake.  I have ordered this product from other sellers on amazon in the past and had no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This products first ingredients:  water, glycerin, acetyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol,stearamidopropyl dimethylamine….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Versus&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEN ordered From WEN website first Ingredients:  Water, aloe vera gel, gylcerin, chamomile extract, cherry bark extract, calendula extract…...</li>
    <li> This is NOT for every hair type! I have  medium long hair that is thick and this make my hair feel UNCLEAN and greasy sometimes. At first I thought I was not using it correctly so the next time I went EXACTLY by the directions on the bottle same effect. I would not recommend this product for anyone with thick hair! YUCK!</li>
    <li> I keep telling people to try this. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years. My coarse, curly hair is smooth and shiny. Yes, I use a flat iron, but my hair stands up to the heat because I don&#x27;t strip it every time I wash it. Once in a while I use a clarifying shampoo. I deep condition once a week or so, as well. One friend did listen and she can&#x27;t believe the change. Oh well! : )</li>
    <li> Great Product! Using Wen has made my hair beautiful and shiny again. Worth every penny I spent!</li>
    <li> From the first time I tried Wen, I determined to never use anything else to clean my hair. It&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Wen&#x27;s products. However, this Wen, Sweet Almond Mint dries my hair. The first time I used it, my hair felt dry and lifeless the second day. I gave it another try, and indeed my hair felt dry and my scalp itched. I have returned  to my of faithful Wen products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not Recommended For Me. prisrob 05-29-14</li>
    <li> Love what it does for dry , thin, wavy hair</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> WEN hair products have made a huge difference on my hair! Love WEN!</li>
    <li> I have fine,frizzy hair and have been using it for at least a year now. I&#x27;ve also tried the Tea Tree and Pomegranate but this is my favorite. The tea tree is more &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34;, as it should be, and the Pomegranate was just ok. Good luck keeping this shampoo away from your daughters!</li>
    <li> I love wen!  My hair has never been healthier .....it&#x27;s great to buy on here so it&#x27;s not auto ship from the wen site.</li>
    <li> This Cleansing conditioner brand is my absolute savior! The only reason my rating is only an &#x27;okay&#x27; as opposed to &#x27;excellent&#x27; is because I had previously bought the WEN Summer Mango and coconut cleansing conditioner and it worked wonders and absolutley loved my medium thick-long-volumunous-dry hair, now the WEN Sweet Almond Mint is created for all types of hair so I decided to experiment since I am new to WEN products I like trying new smells, but unfortunatley Sweet Almond Mint does not hydrate my hair as much as the Summer mango. Still LOVE WEN!!</li>
    <li> This is all you need!</li>
    <li> I tried this for over a month and followed the instructions (thoroughly rinse, only wash your hair twice a week, etc) and my hair felt waxy. I went to get my hair cut and my hair dresser asked me what I did to my &amp;#34;beautiful hair&amp;#34;. I told her that I&#x27;d started using Wen and she immediately told me that Wen was a terrible and unhealthy product for hair. She stripped my hair with clarifying shampoo and I&#x27;m back to using Giovanni Olive Oil hair products.</li>
    <li> It just didn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;m not sure if I would tell anyone that it does want it says it would do.</li>
