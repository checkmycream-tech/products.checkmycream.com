      <li>Love this scent!</li>
      <li>However, I assumed that based on the name &amp;#34;Coconut Passion&amp;#34; the most noticeable fragrance would be COCONUT :p</li>
      <li>product arrived in perfect condition, thanks!</li>
      <li>Nice quality and finished.</li>
      <li>This is a really nice product, smells nice on my lady friend and she loves it.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product, highly recommended</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very tropical without being overwhelming - a perfect summer (and winter!)</li>
      <li>Pleasures fragrance is that it smells so clean and every time I get someone says something about how good it smells.</li>
      <li>fast delivery and very satisfied!</li>
      <li>i love this cream.</li>
      <li>I love this cream lasts several hours in the skin, its aroma is exquisite</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND WILL ORDER THIS AGAIN...  </li>
      <li>but I happen to love the smell of Coconut which led to this purchase.</li>
      <li>This product is amazing, the smell is very Girly and yummy, would recommend to any girl who wants her scent to be smelled by passersby, and complemented for her beautiful scent!</li>

      <li>Excelente servicio, el producto totalmente original hice una buena compra.</li>
      <li>Not very strong scent, but pleasant, doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as when you purchase in store unfortunately, &amp; is more costly.</li>
      <li>i love it, i like so much, thanks</li>
      <li>Is the best cream from Victoria Secret.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know what else to tell you than ITS WORTH</li>
      <li>All are right with this product</li>
      <li>Definitely keeping a stock of Coconut Passion cream available!</li>
      <li>While Victoria&#x27;s Secret is wonderful I usually do not like those kinds of lotions as they are greasy to me.  </li>
      <li>This smelled good but it wasn&#x27;t thick  like cream it was pretty runny.</li>
      <li>The domineering hint is actually Vanilla which is perfectly fine if you prefer Vanilla</li>
      <li>so I feel I definitely get my moneys worth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice thickness - it&#x27;s not watery and it&#x27;s not too thick.  </li>
      <li>Easily fixed - I rub a small amount of extra virgin coconut oil in with the Coconut Passion cream which creates the richly noticeable Coconut scent I desire. :-)</li>
      <li>I recommend it 100% for use only really a wonder in the world</li>
      <li>Hydrates well, non-greasy, leaves skin feeling super soft, always complimented on this scent (by both sexes), and its a long lasting fragrance</li>

    <li> I love sugar and Figure Pleasures fragrance is that it smells so clean and every time I get someone says something about how good it smells. I could not find in stores because they only take her on holidays or something so I had to have it because I ran out of my other and I was not going to wait until they got in store. I even asked for my best friend always asked about it. OH! fast delivery and very satisfied!</li>

Easily fixed - I rub a small amount of extra virgin coconut oil in with the Coconut Passion cream which creates the richly noticeable Coconut scent I desire. :-) Smells delicious! For others, if Vanilla with a hint of Coconut pleases you then no modifications needed. Definitely keeping a stock of Coconut Passion cream available!</li>
