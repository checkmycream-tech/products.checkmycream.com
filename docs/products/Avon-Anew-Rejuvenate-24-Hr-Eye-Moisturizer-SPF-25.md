### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>i am very happy</li>
      <li>But all in all this is a great product!</li>
      <li>This product seemed perfect.  </li>
      <li>Found this at a great price</li>
      <li>and I had great results.</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it!!  </li>
      <li>Awesome product and quality is outstanding,</li>
      <li>Item delivered on time and a good condition.</li>
      <li>I experience no pain at all with that product and it provides superior sun protection.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure of the brand but found out is a great eye moisturizer with sun protection.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to have something with an SPF.  </li>
      <li>This is even better because it has both the day cream with the SPF and the night cream without.</li>
      <li>and they have such great moisturizers!  </li>
      <li>Retina A was rather strong for the eye area.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive eyes at all, so this was surprising.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 35 now and most people (including mature adults) think I&#x27;m about 24!</li>
      <li>I use Neutrogena first because it absorbs quickly</li>
      <li>I dont know if it was expire or why it didnt look the right color.</li>
      <li>my skin was rough and dry and the lines around my eyes were becoming more prominent .</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the day version for several days, and it seems fine.  </li>
      <li>It is OK, but not what I was expected.</li>
      <li>I really like that this has a morning and evening moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I wish I could use it because I really like avon products.</li>
      <li>This does its job, though, just not as much as I&#x27;d like it to.</li>
      <li>I was looking for an eye cream, in a jar, with a decent SPF, at a reasonable cost.  </li>
      <li>And yes, I should have paid more attention to the words and less to the photo.  </li>
      <li>Have tried this product twice, only because I couldn&#x27;t believe the stinging in my eyes the first time.  </li>
      <li>Because this container is divided into both day and night cream, the night side is smaller, and I tend to run out of that much quicker than I run out of the day stuff.  </li>
      <li>I would apply this product, then instantly tear up and have intense pain in my eyes.</li>
      <li>but it really wasn&#x27;t makin a big difference.</li>
      <li>Not sure that it&#x27;s making a huge difference in my wrinkles, but it is helping with under eye circles and puffiness.</li>
      <li>Avon will not be around much longer, last report they are predicted to belly up in the near future.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Yes, I was in a hurry when I ordered this.  And yes, I should have paid more attention to the words and less to the photo.  I was looking for an eye cream, in a jar, with a decent SPF, at a reasonable cost.  This product seemed perfect.  However, it is not what I&#x27;d hoped for.  The jar is actually divided into 2 separate sections, one for the \\&quot;day\\&quot; eye cream with SPF 25, and the other with \\&quot;night\\&quot; eye cream with no SPF.  The inner cover drops into place to hold the contents of the two sections separated.  I really have no need for the night version, and the day version is such a small amount that it fits into a little sample size jar (from another cosmetic company).&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve used the day version for several days, and it seems fine.  However, I won&#x27;t order this product again, and suggest that you understand what you&#x27;ll be getting before placing your order.</li>
    <li> I have dark, puffy circles under my eyes, so I tried this, in hopes of getting rid of them.  While this product reduces them (the circles aren&#x27;t so dark, and they&#x27;re less puffy), it doesn&#x27;t get rid of either completely.  I also have wrinkles around my eyes, and this does nothing to get rid of those.  Because this container is divided into both day and night cream, the night side is smaller, and I tend to run out of that much quicker than I run out of the day stuff.  Because of these issues, I do not intend to use this product again.  Instead, I&#x27;m thinking of trying the Reversalist eye products, or looking for a completely different line of makeup, one that doesn&#x27;t test on animals.  This does its job, though, just not as much as I&#x27;d like it to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 27 year old with bad under eye lines and I was using Neutrogena intensive deep wrinkle eye cream but it really wasn&#x27;t makin a big difference. I started using this and in TWO days I saw a difference! It kinda puffed my under eye area but that made the wrinkles less noticeable. I use Neutrogena first because it absorbs quickly then I follow with this because it absorbs slower, its kinda thick so a little goes a long way. I purchased both items outside of Amazon but now I&#x27;m obsessed with Amazon and get everything here! I also keep using the Neutrogena because it contains Retinol. Yes probably a small amount but I read Retina A was rather strong for the eye area. But all in all this is a great product!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find eye moisturizer with SPF at any store.  Found this at a great price and I absolutely love it!!  Plus it&#x27;s Avon and they have such great moisturizers!  This is even better because it has both the day cream with the SPF and the night cream without.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product.</li>
    <li> Broke me out around my eyes</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t review how this eye cream performs in regard to smoothing lines because every time I applied this my eyes stung terribly. I would apply this product, then instantly tear up and have intense pain in my eyes. I don&#x27;t have sensitive eyes at all, so this was surprising. I would wash off the eye cream, but my eyes would still sting for up to half an hour later. My eye area would be incredibly red and irritated. I attempted to alleviate the issue by only applying the product to the orbital bone and nowhere else, but it still managed to somehow migrate into my eyes and cause pain. This happened with both the night eye cream and the morning eye cream as well. I bought this product because of the SPF. We know that we&#x27;re supposed to apply SPF to our face everyday, but not many talk of the importance of protecting the gentle eye area from the sun as well. This is not the product for those looking for eye area SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After tossing this product out, I purchased La Roche Posay&#x27;s Anthelios Mineral SPF 50 Sunscreen Fluid. It&#x27;s made for your face, but I apply it to my eye area over my eye cream in the morning in addition to all over my face. I experience no pain at all with that product and it provides superior sun protection. I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> I would give a zero rating, but that was not an option.  Have tried this product twice, only because I couldn&#x27;t believe the stinging in my eyes the first time.  I am at the point of not recommending any Avon products since they are horribly overpriced and don&#x27;t seem to do as advertised.  Can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m always in the 2-15% of women that the product doesn&#x27;t work as advertised.  Avon will not be around much longer, last report they are predicted to belly up in the near future.  REad up on the number of layoffs, countries they are pulling out of and the poor quality of offshore customer support.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time and a good condition. I wasn&#x27;t sure of the brand but found out is a great eye moisturizer with sun protection.</li>
    <li> it works !  plain and simple. i got away from avon for a couple of years . my skin was rough and dry and the lines around my eyes were becoming more prominent . i realized that i needed to go back to the anew line. i did and everything has improved. i am very happy</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past when I sold Avon and I had great results. However this time it itched and burned my eyes and everyone commented I looked more tired than usual because my eyes were so blood shot.</li>
    <li> I used the entire jar and I did not see any improvements to  my eye area whatsoever.  If you want a serious eye cream this is probably not for you.</li>
    <li> Although the scent does make my eyes water, I use this product to get rid of eye puffiness caused by sleep deprivation. Noticeably reduces redness and eye circles that are not hereditary.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t use this. It made my eyes burn and water. This resulted in puffy, red eyes-- the opposite of what I was going for. I wish I could use it because I really like avon products.</li>
    <li> I continue to buy this 24 hour eye cream.  It gives you what you need for your daily eye moisturizing needs.  Awesome product and quality is outstanding,</li>
    <li> I really like that this has a morning and evening moisturizer.  It&#x27;s nice to have something with an SPF.  Not sure that it&#x27;s making a huge difference in my wrinkles, but it is helping with under eye circles and puffiness.</li>
    <li> It is OK, but not what I was expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product and the one before it. It&#x27;s been almost 10 yrs. I&#x27;m 35 now and most people (including mature adults) think I&#x27;m about 24!</li>
    <li> My experience was horrible with this product because the person i brought it from sold it to me with it expiring 2weeks after I brought it.  Product was burning my eyes and i couldn&#x27;t understand why. Until i looked at expiration.</li>
    <li> The night cream did not look blue like its suppose to. I dont know if it was expire or why it didnt look the right color.</li>
