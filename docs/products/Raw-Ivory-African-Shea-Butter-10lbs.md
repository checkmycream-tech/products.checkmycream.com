      <li>Within 1 business day, Smell Good resolved the matter by contacting my local post office and obtaining the information I needed to pick up my package.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered from this company twice each time the shea butter arrived in less than a week and worked great for my skin.</li>
      <li>I have ordered shea butter from smellgood several times now and absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>You can tell it&#x27;s kept so fresh.</li>
      <li>smellgood, you get the products you want and service with a smile.</li>
      <li>Shea butter is soft and melts easily when you rub it on your skin.</li>
      <li>The Shea Butter is soft and easy to work with.</li>
      <li>This seller is dishonest and trying to scam people, which I should&#x27;ve figured since the price sounded too good to be true.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery as always!  </li>
      <li>But... it smells funny</li>

      <li>whole family uses ivory shea</li>
      <li>but now I use it all the time with clear smooth and soft hands</li>
      <li>I immediately contacted Smell Good and complained.</li>
      <li>The review that said its mixed with something else is absolutely true.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended</li>
      <li>I found that in warmer climates or during periods of high temperatures the product may become grainy.</li>

      <li>Very soft and silky consistency and</li>
      <li>Simple matter of melting over low heat and pouring into your container thru a piece of clean pantyhose.  </li>
      <li>I was hesitant to buy such a large quantity unfiltered</li>
      <li>I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have been so cheap and just spent the extra $ to get the stuff off ebay</li>
      <li>The natural smell of Shea butter can be a bit offensive for some, though the aroma vanishes once it has been applied to your skin within minutes.</li>
      <li>Natural healing and lubrication plus no stains on clothes.</li>
      <li>if you don&#x27;t like the smell of it put some essential oils of your choice to smellgood, thanks Brother Paul</li>
      <li>Your hair isn’t weighed down; but instead, full of body and life.</li>
      <li>My products have a nice, even, creamy texture that I just couldn&#x27;t obtain using other brands of Raw Shea.  </li>
      <li>I have also purchased shea butter from another company on Amazon (Aurora International) and as far as I am concerned, they both deserve 5 stars.  </li>
      <li>You can also try using all natural oils such as Peppermint, Lemon, Etc.</li>
      <li>Shea butter is the best medicine for all the skin problems you can have , I had very bad cracked hands and feet&lt;</li>

<li> I contacted them once because my package took longer than usual to arrive.</li>
<li> a huge mess,,,the crap was still in there!</li>
<li> This company had some negative reviews which I didn&#x27;t see until after I placed my order, but I chose to believe the statement on their website of:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> As usual, Grade A Shea Butter from Ghana Africa!  </li>
<li> We’re not happy until you’re happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Wrong!</li>

I am happy to say that it smells basically no different than the refined.  Very soft and silky consistency and one can tell just by feeling it that it is superior quality. You will need to melt it down and filter it, yes, as there are bits of debris that you will not want to fish out when using in your products.  Simple matter of melting over low heat and pouring into your container thru a piece of clean pantyhose.  I was not shorted, as some have reported...there was a full 10 lbs.  I am very happy with this and will buy it again when this is used up.</li>
    <li> I have ordered shea butter from smellgood several times now and absolutely love it! Minimal packaging is a plus.</li>
    <li> excellent product, dont like the packing</li>
    <li> The product does not match the displayed image</li>
    <li> I read reviews before I purchased this and of course I seen the negative ones but thought well there&#x27;s only a few maybe they got a bad batch or aren&#x27;t familiar with shea butter,  Wrong! I wish I would have listened, Its awful. Trust me I have experience with shea butter and make numerous body products with it. The review that said its mixed with something else is absolutely true. Shea butter is soft and melts easily when you rub it on your skin. This does not! there&#x27;s some form of hard substance mixed in with it. You can see it plain as day. Its a lighter color and it crumbles when you try to rub it on your skin. Worst I have ever seen. PLEASE BEWARE this seller is definitely ripping you off. Total scam. I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have been so cheap and just spent the extra $ to get the stuff off ebay like I always have.</li>
    <li> Great product. I love the texture&amp; it arrived earlier than expected. I will definitely re-order from this seller.</li>
    <li> Fantastic quality. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Great quality product !</li>
    <li> I recently order the African Shea Butter and I love it so much &amp;#62; I will be ordering some more soon.</li>
    <li> Shea butter is the best medicine for all the skin problems you can have , I had very bad cracked hands and feet&lt;br /&gt;that all year long then would crack and bleed all the time but now I use it all the time with clear smooth and soft hands ask my wife she could tell you and if you don&#x27;t like the smell of it put some essential oils of your choice to smellgood, thanks Brother Paul</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy such a large quantity unfiltered but I have gone through my 10lb order and there was no debris of any sort in it and it was of excellent quality! You can tell it&#x27;s kept so fresh. I guess some people have to get used to the smell but I absolutely love it. Will be purchasing again!!!</li>
    <li> Best deal I&#x27;ve found for Shea butter.</li>
    <li> Product is nice and creamy. Nice color and consistency. Would have given 5 star rating but packaging needs to be improved.</li>
    <li> I ordered 40 lbs. of the Ivory Shea Butter, which I just received.  I went through the bags thoroughly, and I am very happy with my purchase.  This company had some negative reviews which I didn&#x27;t see until after I placed my order, but I chose to believe the statement on their website of:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;A satisfied customer is a repeat customer, and we want you choosing us first whenever our products can meet your needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If ever you have a question or concern about doing business with us, you can use the information on our Contact Us page to reach us.

So please check back with us often, as our style an selections are updated often.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this statement of smellgood to be true when it comes to my order.  I have also purchased shea butter from another company on Amazon (Aurora International) and as far as I am concerned, they both deserve 5 stars.  I would definitely recommend smellgood and Aurora.  I love supporting small businesses and they both have earned my trust and satisfaction as a new and now a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely Amazing!!! It is indeed 100 % Top Grade Raw Unrefined Shea Butter. I&#x27;ve used other brands in the past and this one is Number 1 on my list. I started purchasing this Shea Butter 2 years ago.  I needed an all-natural Shea Butter to use for my Hair and Skin product line. I was very pleased with the fast shipping of my order and even more pleased with the quality of the product. The Shea Butter is soft and easy to work with. It blends well with other essential oils I use. My products have a nice, even, creamy texture that I just couldn&#x27;t obtain using other brands of Raw Shea.  Other brands required me to use mass amounts of essential oils to try to obtain the texture I get with this Shea and it never really hit the mark. With this Shea, I use very minimal amounts of essential oils to obtain the creamy texture I desire for my products. This Shea is very easy to apply to your hair and skin. Your hair isn’t weighed down; but instead, full of body and life. The natural smell of Shea butter can be a bit offensive for some, though the aroma vanishes once it has been applied to your skin within minutes. You can also try using all natural oils such as Peppermint, Lemon, Etc. to hold it at bay. The folks at Smell Good are also very professional. I contacted them once because my package took longer than usual to arrive. Within 1 business day, Smell Good resolved the matter by contacting my local post office and obtaining the information I needed to pick up my package. Another time I noticed a gritty texture and thought Smell Good had sent me a bad batch of Shea. I was upset because I had to refund one of my customers because they claimed they found salt in the product. I immediately contacted Smell Good and complained. While I awaited a response, I researched and found hundreds of blogs on this issue. I found that in warmer climates or during periods of high temperatures the product may become grainy. Smell Good replied with the same information and eased my mind. In my profession it is very important to have a quality product but it is equally important to do business with a professional company. I appreciate Smell Good for providing both.ased my mind. In my profession it is very important to have a quality product but it is equally important to do business with a professional company.

    <li> This shea butter is the most moisturizing thing I have ever used! But... it smells funny, I guess I don&#x27;t have anything to compare the smell to but its an almost unbearable scent. I will try to add an essential oil and see if the smell goes away. Besides that it is a good price and last a long time.</li>
    <li> this is my second order from atl and i&#x27;m very pleased&lt;br /&gt;the texture is smooth and creamy i used it rite away&lt;br /&gt;the amount was great for the price i paid&lt;br /&gt;i will definitely be re-ordering in the future&lt;br /&gt;the whole family uses ivory shea butter(wish i came across this years ago)&lt;br /&gt;initially got it for my sons eczema and his skin is looking better and better&lt;br /&gt;this combined with african black soap(dudu osun) and castor oil seams to work wonders</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered from this company twice each time the shea butter arrived in less than a week and worked great for my skin.</li>
    <li> Great price and quality! This is the 3rd box we have purchased use it liberally. Natural healing and lubrication plus no stains on clothes.</li>
    <li> It was very creamy and fresh. I got the full amount that was advertised. I was very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best shea butters I have encountered in a long time.  It is very soft and fresh as it should be.  When ordering online you never know what you will get.  The price is extremely reasonable as well.</li>
    <li> As usual, Grade A Shea Butter from Ghana Africa!  Fast delivery as always!  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> This is supposed to be shea butter...it is not. It is a mixture of shea and something else. I&#x27;m thinking bee&#x27;s wax maybe. Either way this product is USELESS! When you use it there are lumps and beads of crap that do not dissolve! I tried melting it all and sifting it out which took forever and was a huge mess,,,the crap was still in there! This seller is dishonest and trying to scam people, which I should&#x27;ve figured since the price sounded too good to be true. It seems like this may have happened only recently though because most of the other bad reviews about the same problem are of recent, August, Sept. Quality over quantity for me... I&#x27;d rather spend a bit more for the real thing instead of rub God knows what onto my skin. DO NOT BUY!</li>
