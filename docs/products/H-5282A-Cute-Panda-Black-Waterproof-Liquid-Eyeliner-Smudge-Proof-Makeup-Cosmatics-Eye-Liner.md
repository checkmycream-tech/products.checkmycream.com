      <li>I am enjoying this product.  </li>
      <li>Love it .</li>
      <li>love this eyeliner~</li>
      <li>it works fine and is in a cute bottle</li>
      <li>Well first off, it comes in a very cute bottle.</li>
      <li>The felt tip brush makes application SO easy, and for me it makes it easier to control the thickness of the line.</li>
      <li>It does come off easily so just don&#x27;t rub your eyes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just ok, nothing special.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s pretty nice, i like it</li>
      <li>The eyeliner itself was fine and works well.</li>
      <li>super cute &amp; useful&lt;</li>
      <li>I know its super cute but its cheap plastic</li>
      <li>only problem with this great eyeliner is the cheap container</li>
      <li>A great wear for school actually.</li>
      <li>Although it was really cheap, I regret buying this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super adorable, super amazing, and this is certainly the liner I&#x27;ll be purchasing from now on.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;it wasn&#x27;t all the way full and it looked like as if some of the contents spilled on the container.</li>
      <li>All in all I just loved the product and will definitely buy again.</li>
      <li>I ordered this product, and always go cheap on the shipping (I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only one who does this).</li>
      <li>The liner is excellent and I was too tired wash off before bed</li>
      <li>The bottle is super cute, but not very big.</li>
      <li>I love this eyeliner for the bottom part of my eye, but to do the top part I have to use something a little bit thicker.</li>
      <li>I bought this with another eyeliner, the cute bear liquid eyeliner by the same person.</li>
      <li>I actually like this a bit more than i thought i would.</li>
      <li>Will order more shortly, this will be my product for life.</li>
      <li>and I would definitely buy it again. :)</li>
      <li>I emailed them and they wrote back sure we can do that no problem ..</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s pretty nice.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The eyeliner is strong, glides well and can last for hours.</li>
      <li>JUST clean off the brush occasionally to prevent this, do this and it WILL last you well over two months or more depending on how much you wear</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really like it at all</li>
      <li>, well it really ISN&#x27;T a brush like what you&#x27;d think.</li>
      <li>But I tried, I really did, and this liner will not smudge.</li>
      <li>The bottle is really cute too, mine came in pink.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t get much out of it for makeup</li>
      <li>Though the main reason why i like this is because its the only eyeliner where the stick ( connecting from the brush to the handle) wasn&#x27;t super long, so i could put it on better.</li>
      <li>It is sold at a decent price.</li>
      <li>The bottle is very cute, but the eyeliner itself is very wet, &amp; goes on pretty oddly.</li>
      <li>I used the liner as soon as I opened the package with glee (lame, I know), and it was great.</li>
      <li>I was a little weary of the eyeliner since it was so cheap, but it works really well.</li>
      <li>I got the white one~ very kawaii!</li>
      <li>You can also peel it off your eye.. but its dark (which is good) but its not easy to apply.</li>
      <li>it wears a long time.it was very reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>The only tip I can give is to have a q-tip ready in case</li>
      <li>But Only Got One - Other Than That : So Going To Buy More In The Future.</li>
      <li>It certainly is a true black, an has yet to fade.</li>
      <li>The seller should really tell people that they&#x27;ll only be getting one thing of eyeliner instead of an entire box.</li>
      <li>*, it breaks easily if you don&#x27;t clean the brush because it will clump on you and dry out on the brush stick, making it stiff and hard to twist off.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered through other sellers with a 95% rating or higher, and had to settle in and wait the standard week to ten days.</li>

<li> but it last long time</li>
<li> I had to dip a q-tip into some hypoallergenic eye makeup remover, squeeze out the excess (thus forming a flat tip) and remove the unwanted liner.</li>
<li> It was in my mailbox only 3 days later, along with 2 other beauty products I had ordered at the same time.</li>
<li> It does smudge, &amp; doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this eyeliner for the bottom part of my eye, but to do the top part I have to use something a little bit thicker. It&#x27;s easy to apply this eyeliner and it stays on for a really long time without looking bad. I definitely would recommend at least trying out this eyeliner. Also the shipping time was great considering it came from out of the country.</li>
    <li> this eyeliner is a great deal the packaging is so adorable!!! i absolutely loved it. and will repurchase more.</li>
    <li> I got it and I think it is the cutes thing ever not only that but it last long time</li>
    <li> I was a little weary of the eyeliner since it was so cheap, but it works really well. It has a felt tip applicator and I thought it was going to be a brush, but it still works great, and lasts.</li>
    <li> It applies so smoothly and the bottle is so cute!! It is the best eyeliner I ever had and I would definitely buy it again. :)</li>
    <li> The bottle is very cute, but the eyeliner itself is very wet, &amp; goes on pretty oddly. It does smudge, &amp; doesn&#x27;t last very long. Although it was really cheap, I regret buying this. All it does is sit in my makeup box collecting dust. And the color said black, but came out a charcoal greyish color.</li>
    <li> This stuff is probably my favorite eyeliner, the felt tip is easy to use and very precise, it lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t budge, even with my allergies!!</li>
    <li> i got this eyeliner cuz the price and its wonderful it has amazing love lasting strokes and it has an amazing design it stays on all day and i love it!  not to mention all the compliments i get when putting it on!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m doing the review after few months of having this order in my hand so i&#x27;m going off of what i can sorta remember. I remember 2 things for sure... 1. cute packaging 2) for some reason I was thinking I was going to receive more than 1 smh</li>
    <li> I really like this, and to all the people saying stuff about quantity, IT SAYS ONE IN THE DESCRIPTION!!!!! Learn to read... by  it works fine and is in a cute bottle</li>
    <li> Love it . Goes on well , and it&#x27;s so adorable . Everyone should have this liquid eyeliner it&#x27;s amazing</li>
    <li> Thrilled with this and will be shopping  a lot more with them.  The liner is excellent and I was too tired wash off before bed and I got up in the morning and It was still 3/4 on!  I love the Panda Bottle too, it looks so cute on my vanity!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product, and always go cheap on the shipping (I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only one who does this). It was in my mailbox only 3 days later, along with 2 other beauty products I had ordered at the same time. I was amazed. I&#x27;ve ordered through other sellers with a 95% rating or higher, and had to settle in and wait the standard week to ten days. I used the liner as soon as I opened the package with glee (lame, I know), and it was great. The only tip I can give is to have a q-tip ready in case you don&#x27;t get the line perfect, because it truly is smudgeproof once it dries. I had to dip a q-tip into some hypoallergenic eye makeup remover, squeeze out the excess (thus forming a flat tip) and remove the unwanted liner. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> It is as good as any $20-30 dollar eyeliner you would find anywhere. If you don&#x27;t have a steady hand then this may be hard for you to apply to get perfectly thin lines. It will not smudge or run after a long night clubbing or being out and about.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem with this great eyeliner is the cheap container *I know its super cute but its cheap plastic*, it breaks easily if you don&#x27;t clean the brush because it will clump on you and dry out on the brush stick, making it stiff and hard to twist off.  JUST clean off the brush occasionally to prevent this, do this and it WILL last you well over two months or more depending on how much you wear it.&lt;br /&gt;I love this eyeliner~ I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now. :)</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be as a good quality because of the price. I got it because it was cute and I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just ok, nothing special. I was expecting the tip brush would be a bit softer, just too hard for me.</li>
    <li> Mine just arrived today, I got the white bottle. I absolutely love this liner. The felt tip brush makes application SO easy, and for me it makes it easier to control the thickness of the line. It certainly is a true black, an has yet to fade. It also dries in seconds. The best part though, I have to admit is that it&#x27;s smudge proof. Usually when I get a smudge prof liner, it can smudge anyway. But I tried, I really did, and this liner will not smudge. It&#x27;s super adorable, super amazing, and this is certainly the liner I&#x27;ll be purchasing from now on.</li>
    <li> for it&#x27;s price, this eye-liner is very good!</li>
    <li> - Great &amp; Amazing ; Product. Expected To Get 3 But Only Got One - Other Than That : So Going To Buy More In The Future.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is wonderful fully went above and beyond expectations and as a bonus is in the cutest bottle ever!</li>
    <li> It works like liquid eyeliner should work. The bottle is so so cute too. I will probably order it again.</li>
    <li> This product I feel peels off and does not go on very smooth ... I didn&#x27;t really like it at all</li>
    <li> The brush is really hard and it hurts my eye and irritates it. You can also peel it off your eye.. but its dark (which is good) but its not easy to apply. (Atleast for me) so I rated it a 3.</li>
    <li> Every time I tried to use this product it seemed like it was always dried up. I didn&#x27;t get much out of it for makeup but it did help for coloring in dark spots on clothing.</li>
    <li> loved its quality but when I received the package, it was in poor(ish) condition&lt;br /&gt;it wasn&#x27;t all the way full and it looked like as if some of the contents spilled on the container.</li>
    <li> Upon receiving I thought I was getting a pack and I ended up getting only 2 random colors,  turn they were broken, so when I opened it you can only imagine the mess it made on the floor and my shirt.....</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter. It says you get 1 at random color if you want a specific color email them....well my daughter wanted pink. I emailed them and they wrote back sure we can do that no problem .. well few days later. I received a random color anyways . But the eye liner is great and easy for my daughter to use .</li>
    <li> Well first off, it comes in a very cute bottle. It is sold at a decent price. The eyeliner is strong, glides well and can last for hours. A great wear for school actually. Plus with makeup remover it comes off faster than the blink of the eye! A very satisfying purchase. Also, the tip is very stiff, but it gives me good/nice straight lines for when I am doing my winged eye looks! :) I got the white one~ very kawaii!</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this product.  Works on my skin tone, African American.  Will order more shortly, this will be my product for life.</li>
    <li> cutest lil containers and it wears a long time.it was very reasonably priced. i love them id reccomend them to any one</li>
    <li> I actually like this a bit more than i thought i would. The bottle is really cute too, mine came in pink. Though i thought i was going to get three.&lt;br /&gt; I bought this with another eyeliner, the cute bear liquid eyeliner by the same person. I thought i was going to spend AT LEAST 5 dollars for them both, ended up spending about 15 dollars (what the hell? for two little bottles of eyeliner..) Anyway, it&#x27;s the shipping and handling that gets you with the price. Just and FYI.&lt;br /&gt; The bottle is super cute, but not very big. Though the main reason why i like this is because its the only eyeliner where the stick ( connecting from the brush to the handle) wasn&#x27;t super long, so i could put it on better. So the bottle is rather tiny.&lt;br /&gt;The brush, well it really ISN&#x27;T a brush like what you&#x27;d think. it&#x27;s rather hard and kinda feels like just plastic, i found my self dipping it back in the bottle quite a bit. Although, because it&#x27;s harder its wayy easy to make those thin lines i always try to do. And it&#x27;s pretty nice.&lt;br /&gt; It lasts longer than i expected and didnt start chipping until i got home and started my eyes ( im saying this cause i have a liquid eyeliner that doesnt come off for ANYTHING! @.@) which is nice, and it also comes of nicely with a makeup remover cloth, i didnt have to spend 15 minutes rubbing my eye. only about a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty nice, i like it and i usually use it when i wear liquid eyeliner. However, it could be a better.</li>
    <li> super cute &amp; useful&lt;br /&gt;best eyeliner i&#x27;ve ever used &lt;3 . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . .</li>
    <li> ok soo i loved them there the best liquid eyeliner iv ever used but the owner should tell how many your going to get...............they did come excatly the day that it said  GREAT DEAL</li>
    <li> I got this today and it came earlier than expected. I really loved the cute panda look.  It does come off easily so just don&#x27;t rub your eyes. I did take a nap and and about 3/4 of the liner was still there. I like the tiny brush,so  I can do teenie tiny lines on my eyes. This is perfect for an easy cateye/winged liner look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  All in all I just loved the product and will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> i like it but it makes my eyes water and itch which causes it to rub off..</li>
    <li> The eyeliner itself was fine and works well. However, I expected to get a box of them but only got one. The seller should really tell people that they&#x27;ll only be getting one thing of eyeliner instead of an entire box.</li>
