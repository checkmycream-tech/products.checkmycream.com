      <li>I wanted to make sure it wasn&#x27;t too staticy and hold onto hair.  </li>
      <li>What more can a person say?</li>
      <li>I ordered two capes and I am so glad I did.  </li>
      <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>I love this cape.</li>
      <li>but it is great not having so much hair all over their pants and shirts.  </li>
      <li>what it is, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find any better.</li>
      <li>You have to kind of bend the velcro around pulling on the cape to match the other velcro piece perfectly; A faster, more comfortable way to fasten the cape onto my neck would be nice.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a full size nice quality cape.  </li>
      <li>It feels ok and doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
      <li>: Their waterproof, give excellent coverage if coloring hair or to keep clothes extremely clean, dry and everything else under the sun.</li>
      <li>For years, I always used those cheap capes that came with scissors and razor kits...hated those things.  </li>
      <li>You may want to wear a light cloth, expendable dishcloth around your neck before fastening.  </li>
      <li>I have yet to use it on a customer with a huge neck, but think that when I do, it will fit him.  </li>
      <li>Not too light</li>
      <li>dis product is really good,i bought it as part of the items i need in school,the quality is indeed a good one and so far i love it,i will order more</li>
      <li>Reviews made it out to sound thicker but for the price and free shipping they almost gave it away</li>
      <li>Because of it&#x27;s light weight</li>
      <li>It was easy to clean.</li>
      <li>It does just find, but the extra coverage would have been great.  </li>
      <li>Very useful product, during hair treatment and hair color.</li>
      <li>wipe clean</li>
      <li>It is not only beautiful, but made of a very stron material.  </li>
      <li>The only thing that would have made this cape perfect, would have been if it was longer in the back.  </li>
      <li>my clients loved it and it felt gd like and expensive shampoo cape great buy</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly, in about 2 days.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo cape is good for shampooing and keeping your body dry over a sink.</li>
      <li>The neck is too large for my kids, but with a hair clip it stays shut just fine.</li>
      <li>you make a purchase, hope you enjoy it as much as I do…</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s also useful to keep hair off if you&#x27;re getting your haircut.</li>
      <li>Hair doesn&#x27;t stick to it and drops or brushes right</li>
      <li>I highly recommended this product as we are VERY satified!!!</li>
      <li>Good value for the money, does the job just fine, keeping hair off my husband and son and is long enough</li>
      <li>/&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the purchase of this cape, it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for and that&#x27;s protecting someone from getting wet with water or their clothes from getting hair dye and other products on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The price was very reasonable.  </li>
      <li>This is easy to use and I love the metallic black color.  </li>
      <li>sure enough, here it is!  </li>
      <li>With this it didn&#x27;t exactly solve the problem by the neck</li>
      <li>If you have it on for an extended period of time it gets pretty hot underneath, but if you&#x27;re using it to shampoo like you&#x27;re supposed to won&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
      <li>Got this to dye my hair with and it did exactly what I wanted it to do.</li>
      <li>they got all sweaty and were quite uncomfortably hot.</li>
      <li>It might get hot</li>
      <li>This cape was exactly what I needed.  </li>
      <li>Great price, still decently thick.  </li>
      <li>This does exactly what it is suppose to do.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>The material is heavy and good quality.</li>
      <li>Skin contact will only make you sweat more haha.</li>
      <li>The cape its self, is a nice thick plastic material and seems far sturdier than many of the cheaper capes I&#x27;ve purchased throughout the years.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>The neckhole is much too large for my 6 yr olds neck.</li>
      <li>It is sizable enough to fit almost anyone.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t really beat the price.</li>
      <li>It protected me from the dye haha.</li>
      <li>This product is excellent for cutting hair.</li>
      <li>Works very well for hair cuts.  </li>
      <li>The Velcro closure on these is plentiful, gets attached very well</li>
      <li>A must-have if you&#x27;re really serios about hair-style.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> For years I have been talking about replacing the cape that came with our Oster clippers, as it was paper thin and tore within the first few uses.  This cape was exactly what I needed.  I only average a few hair-cuts each month, but I wanted something that would clean-up easily and be durable.  This cape is a nice weight and you can&#x27;t beat the price being offered by Amazon!</li>
    <li> i like it alot, seems to be good quality.  I cute hair at my house for family and friends and it works just great!!</li>
    <li> The item came on time and I will be using it as a cape for haircuts at home.  No complaints here.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I needed something to protect my skin and clothing when I dye my hair after ruining many nice towels!  I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t think of getting one of these before. . . on a whim I thought I would see whether Amazon carried it and sure enough, here it is!  I love it!  I also clip my boys hair once in awhile and they hate getting hair in their shirts.  This simple and inexpensive cape is the perfect solution! And I am in total agreement with the other reviewers, this is a great thick plastic material that looks like it will last a long time!  Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> Not much to say about this cape.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.    Likes:   keeps hair from clothes  gives you the \\&quot;caped crusader\\&quot; look  Dislikes:  none</li>
    <li> This is an excellent quality Shampoo Cape, and I am a hairdresser who knows good when I see it. Great size, and I can tell it will hold up for a long time... possibly years... that&#x27;s how long my last cape lasted. I would buy this item again in a heartbeat, and the service from this seller was excellent!</li>
    <li> I ordered two capes and I am so glad I did.  They are extra long and cover beyond the knees.  They are great!  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This was so cheap but the product is NOT - excellent quality!!  LOVE it and use it a lot!</li>
    <li> This is a seriously high quality hair cutting cape. Well, that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re going to use it for anyways. It&#x27;s nice and thick. I was very impressed, especially for the price! Awesome!</li>
    <li> The shampoo cape is good for shampooing and keeping your body dry over a sink. But it&#x27;s also useful to keep hair off if you&#x27;re getting your haircut.</li>
    <li> The neckhole is much too large for my 6 yr olds neck. Had to improvise to get it to stay in place. I&#x27;d rather have it too large than too small though. Good coverage. No complaints of itchiness after his haircut, so everyone&#x27;s happy.</li>
    <li> Does the job of keeping hair off of your clothes during a haircut.  It doesn&#x27;t really cover your back as its not long enough.</li>
    <li> This cape is solid quality.  It is very durable and will last for a long time.  I use it for my husband and my children.  The neck is too large for my kids, but with a hair clip it stays shut just fine.</li>
    <li> It was inexpensive but it looks great and works well. The material is heavy and good quality. It might get hot but I only use it to cut my son or husband&#x27;s hair so they aren&#x27;t wearing it for very long...no complaints from them yet.</li>
    <li> Although the cape is rather cheap, it is made with strong material that should last a long time. I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> The size of the cape worked well when dying my hair. It was easy to clean. I liked the Velcro around the neck.</li>
    <li> For years, I always used those cheap capes that came with scissors and razor kits...hated those things.  I finally broke down and decided to get a proper cape.  WHY didn&#x27;t I do it sooner?!  This cape is heavy and well made - even my husband likes it!  I waited to write a review about it until I actually got to use it.  I wanted to make sure it wasn&#x27;t too staticy and hold onto hair.  So far, I find it seems to shake off with no problems.  The only thing that would have made this cape perfect, would have been if it was longer in the back.  It&#x27;s a barber style, so it&#x27;s shorter in the back.  It does just find, but the extra coverage would have been great.  Anyway, it was a great deal and we&#x27;re very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Hook and loop closure at the neck is a little rough and allows for edges of plastic piping to jab into your skin.  You may want to wear a light cloth, expendable dishcloth around your neck before fastening.  Excellent coverage, easy to move around in (if you&#x27;re doing your own hair).  High on the stinky plastic smell, but hopefully airing out will get rid of that.</li>
    <li> works great, easy to clean. just as described. client thought it was comfy and i would highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> We bought this cape as a way to replace our hair cutting cape because it was a low cost option. It does great job of keep everything off the cape and so it works wonderfully. If you have it on for an extended period of time it gets pretty hot underneath, but if you&#x27;re using it to shampoo like you&#x27;re supposed to won&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  It&#x27;s heavy enough not to be flyaway.  Hair doesn&#x27;t stick to it and drops or brushes right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But -&lt;br /&gt;1. It is hot.&lt;br /&gt;2. The neck seam is a litte irritating to the skin, especially at the hook-and-loop closure.&lt;br /&gt;3. There is not enough coverage at the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a good value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But - Did I mention it&#x27;s HOT?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be looking to buy something else with a little more coverage and maybe some kind of nylon weave for a little breathability.</li>
    <li> My husband and son loved wearing this cape the first time I cut their hair, but the 2nd time I cut it outside on our back deck, and it was a hot day- they got all sweaty and were quite uncomfortably hot. It does a great job of keeping the hair off of them though, and the hair just slides off the cape, so that&#x27;s nice. Anyway, next time I will give haircuts in the a/c&#x27;d house!</li>
    <li> This is a plastic cape. It feels ok and doesn&#x27;t look cheap. If you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive cape that looks and feels good , this will do the job.</li>
    <li> I love this cape. It makes it easier to color or shampoo my hair.  The price was very reasonable.  It arrived quickly, in about 2 days.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for cutting hair. It is not only beautiful, but made of a very stron material.  It is better and stronger than more expensive products on the market. I give it 5 stars....</li>
    <li> We use this as a hair cutting cape, rather than a shampoo cape, and it works great for our preschooler.  It is short in the back, but still PLENTY long to protect him from all that itchy hair!  Just what we were looking for at a great price!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Good value.</li>
    <li> This cape is professional grade....well constructed with a heavier weight plastic.  I use at home for trimming my husbands hair and my teenage daughter uses on her girlfriends hair as they are deciding on what the color of the week is going to be...lol.  Will definitely be using this cape for years to come.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t help but give these wonderful capes five stars because everything they write in the description is exactly what comes out of the package. These capes are a little heavy but that&#x27;s to be expected from a product which is waterproof and meant for protecting people from products and water. Not too light but I can definitely say that they are waterproof and should hold up for quite a while. For reasons like that is why I not only purchased one but I purchased three of them after having this same product which lasted in excess of one year before it failed in the hands of a friend. If you&#x27;re looking for a waterproof clothes protector that should last six months to a year, then you found the right product and definitely the when you&#x27;re looking for right here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the purchase of this cape, it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for and that&#x27;s protecting someone from getting wet with water or their clothes from getting hair dye and other products on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Their waterproof, give excellent coverage if coloring hair or to keep clothes extremely clean, dry and everything else under the sun. There are nice medium weight nylon with some sort of fabric reinforcement (not plastic) and seemed to last a long time. The Velcro closure on these is plentiful, gets attached very well and I imagine it will last much longer than any other cape of the same price range if not longer. Because this cape is waterproof, it will be warmer than a light fabric cape used for cutting hair which is to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Because this cape is waterproof it will be warmer a light weight breathable, haircutting cape which was only to be expected. If you want a cape for haircutting, purchase one for haircutting because this one is not for you. This one will protect close from anything under the sun or pretty near and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you make a purchase, hope you enjoy it as much as I do…</li>
    <li> I needed something for at home use and this worked well.  I use only for hair cutting and not for shampooing though.</li>
    <li> With wanting to do home haircuts I read reviews and decided to go with this one. I&#x27;m very satisfied and it&#x27;s a great length and is made very well. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Wow... these capes are of super quality for the price...and they are quite stylish in the metallic black color.  My daughters use the capes when we color/highlight their hair at home by wearing the cape backwards (it protects their shirt/back from their long hair dripping color).  I highly recommended this product as we are VERY satified!!!</li>
    <li> I am using this for when I cut my own hair (so the hair doesn&#x27;t stick to my back and shoulders).  The problem is I get sweaty because this cape doesn&#x27;t breath; But it is not suppose to because it is for using when shampooing your hair.  The velcro strap around the neck is nice, but it is hard to center the velcro pieces together straight and it itches my neck often (like wool).  You have to kind of bend the velcro around pulling on the cape to match the other velcro piece perfectly; A faster, more comfortable way to fasten the cape onto my neck would be nice.  Overall I like this cape; It does what I bought it for.  It&#x27;s attractive.</li>
    <li> Good value for the money, does the job just fine, keeping hair off my husband and son and is long enough</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a full size nice quality cape.  The velcro neck is large enough and hooks the cape up well on the neck.  I have yet to use it on a customer with a huge neck, but think that when I do, it will fit him.  The cape its self, is a nice thick plastic material and seems far sturdier than many of the cheaper capes I&#x27;ve purchased throughout the years.&lt;br /&gt;For what it is, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find any better.</li>
    <li> Simply a cape. The product is as described, works as expected, and will not make you fly due to the lack of the &amp;#34;S&amp;#34; on it. Seems durable enough to last years.</li>
    <li> This does exactly what it is suppose to do. Keep the hair off clothes and skin. But the black is simple and nice.</li>
    <li> keeps the hair off the chair and a good seal around the neck too keep the hair out and off clothing</li>
    <li> dis product is really good,i bought it as part of the items i need in school,the quality is indeed a good one and so far i love it,i will order more and i recommend dis product.</li>
    <li> I like this alot. It keeps my clothes protected when I dye and it doesn&#x27;t have any problems washing it in the machine then letting it air dry. Glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Got this to dye my hair with and it did exactly what I wanted it to do. It protected me from the dye haha. I suggest wearing a t-shirt with it though, not a tank-top. The cape is a VERY THICK vinyl and as such it is heavy and hot. You want to wear something breathable under it. Skin contact will only make you sweat more haha.</li>
    <li> Works great. Keeps hair off of the body - no more itching from pesky hair that has gotten into your shirt. It has a velcro closure so that you can adjust for large and small necks.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use for cutting hair, and now realize it is better suited as a shampoo only cape. The hair sticks to it everywhere and it becomes a total mess. The fabric is very high quality but don&#x27;t use it for cutting hair!!</li>
    <li> This cape is so hot, you&#x27;d better be done with the procedure in a few minutes, or the person will be sweating profusely!!</li>
    <li> Great price, still decently thick.  Reviews made it out to sound thicker but for the price and free shipping they almost gave it away so I cant complain.  It will work great for doing our at home hair cuts for my kids.</li>
    <li> my son and husband both wear there hair really short and are both tight with their money so they started cutting their own hair, I catch them leaving the house with hair all over them, this helps me to help them from spreading their hair everywhere!!!!:)</li>
    <li> It is a black shampoo cape. It does what it is supposed to do. What more can a person say?</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gag gift for Christmas for a friend and included it with a box of hair color. Did not open package but it had nice weight to the box. Can&#x27;t really beat the price.</li>
    <li> This cape does a great job protecting me from hair during my haircuts.  Combined with my neck strips, I can now emerge from my stay-at-home haircuts without the itchy feeling I used to get.</li>
    <li> I have been on and off cutting my boys hair.  They always complained how the hair were all over their clothes and neck.  With this it didn&#x27;t exactly solve the problem by the neck but it is great not having so much hair all over their pants and shirts.  Husband loves it and now started to ask me to cut his hair as well.</li>
    <li> It will serve its purpose. It is sizable enough to fit almost anyone. A bit scatchy around neck. wipe clean</li>
    <li> I received the items very early. Very useful product, during hair treatment and hair color. Because of it&#x27;s light weight I do not feel uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> my wife cuts my hair since i am in the military. we use these more for keeping the hair off each other</li>
    <li> Long enough to cover you, easy to clean, soft material. A must-have if you&#x27;re really serios about hair-style. I also use it when I give my dog a bath. Practical. Nice.</li>
    <li> Cape was so heavy but like professional heavy my clients loved it and it felt gd like and expensive shampoo cape great buy</li>
    <li> This is easy to use and I love the metallic black color.  Easy to put on and easy to remove with little mess to clean up afterwards.</li>
    <li> I cut my husband&#x27;s hair and we use this cape to keep the hair off him while I am cutting.  It is heavy vinyl and slips on over the head then tightens around the neck with velcro.  Works very well for hair cuts.  We have never used it for shampoos.</li>
