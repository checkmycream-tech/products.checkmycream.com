      <li>Thanks Amazon.com!!!!</li>

      <li>The floral, fresh, musk combination is amazing, all achieved without a strong overwhelming scent.</li>
      <li>The packaging looked better in a photo but felt like something cheap, like the leftovers from an outlet store.</li>
      <li>This is a very nice product for gifting to some one near &amp; dear.</li>
      <li>Then again, I&#x27;m easily amused.  </li>
      <li>you will smell like strong peppers.</li>
      <li>I prefer a strong flowery smelling perfume</li>
      <li>I layer the bodywash, lotion and perfum and it lasts all day without being too strong.</li>
      <li>The lotion is moisturizing and gentle without the stickiness of some scented lotions, the shower gel is also moisture rich with a good lather.</li>
      <li>Packaging and handling were just fine.  </li>
      <li>The parfum was original but the lotions had no smell at all and the lotions did not have original design as the parfum.  </li>
      <li>i would do ,, i wanted it to give it as a gift for a special event</li>
      <li>This product has a floral fragrance, very fresh and the price is right.</li>
      <li>It was delivered in time as expected, the price is reasonable &amp; it has a very good fragrance.</li>
      <li>and many people have commented I love the smell of your perfume when she is out in the public.</li>
      <li>I could not find it and luckily for me</li>
      <li>This perfume is also a lily of the valley floral but nowhere near as strong smelling!</li>
      <li>I enjoy it very mucho on her.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay for her sensitive skin and his allergies.</li>
      <li>Did not smell right.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Bellagio\\&quot; is a gorgeous scent that opens with an intoxicating blend of florals - I get a lush white floral burst - almost like gardenia - that settles into something softer.  </li>
      <li>It was&#x27;nt sweet, or musky or soft or bold....</li>
      <li>The odor wears off VERY FAST.  </li>
      <li>as you can see, there is smokey glass at the top and bottom of a silvery canister - there are actually TWO bottles of the perfume, totaling the 3.4 oz. of perfume.  </li>
      <li>love the mixed flora scent.</li>
      <li>it was exactly what i was looking for.</li>
      <li>im an avid fan of jm</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light and airy but strong enough to be commented on and to last all day.</li>
      <li>I think this is very cool, personally.  </li>
      <li>This a fantastic product, a smell from the past when the things were more real.  </li>
      <li>the fragrance is light , it last about 15 minutes .</li>
      <li>/&gt;One really neat thing about the bottle -</li>
      <li>This is a very lovely,light scent.  </li>
      <li>All the ones I listed above are light florals.</li>
      <li>This was not the real thing.</li>
      <li>The shower gel is scented the same as the perfume and full of lots of bubbles.  </li>
      <li>The lotion is nice and thick and luxurious - very moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>The Item is good, but the packaging is poor, the shower gel crimp had a leak and the almost all of the gel spilled inside the package.</li>
      <li>I had first found Michaelangelo scent at the  Bellagio casino in LV several years ago.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t care for it, it was too light and the smell didn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
      <li>but like I said, kind of weak.</li>
      <li>but kind of weak.  </li>
      <li>A drop of this spicy perfume last the whole day.</li>
      <li>No one would like to stay near you.</li>
      <li>This product was delivered on time and was exactly what I expected.  </li>
      <li>I have been wearing Realities for Women for years and recently began experimenting for new fragrances along that same line.</li>
      <li>i will be very cautious when oredering beauty products.!same thing with other perfume orders...</li>
      <li>Okay, I bought this as a gift for a friend for Christmas but was so disappointed no words are adequate.</li>
      <li>and i am disappointed i would prefer to go to a store and get something better .. if you want it quick d&#x27;ont buy it from here .</li>

<li> After a few hours the dry-down gives a softly musky sandalwood fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> and so i am getting everyday unhappy for the delay its taking even more than extra 2 days than the regular shipping its almost a week</li>
<li> The smell itslelf was somewhat similar to rubbing alcohol but with a distinct odor that difficult to describe.</li>
<li> This product looks beautiful but it smells horrific!  </li>
<li> By using the shower gel, putting on the lotion and then topping it with the perfume you can make the scent last all day long with little need for a touch up - the art of layering.</li>
<li> Therefore, I could not use this item as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;One of the worst transactions through Amazon I have experienced.</li>
<li> Not worth</li>
<li> The lotion was bland.</li>
<li> Package was damaged in that the shower get burst open from the cold.</li>
<li> very weak</li>
<li> except i hate theses rating surveys</li>

    <li> I gave this to my mother for Mother&#x27;s Day.  She loves it.  Packaging and handling were just fine.  Nothing to complain about.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Bellagio\\&quot; is a gorgeous scent that opens with an intoxicating blend of florals - I get a lush white floral burst - almost like gardenia - that settles into something softer.  After a few hours the dry-down gives a softly musky sandalwood fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Launched by the design house of Bellagio in 2000, Bellagio perfume by Micaelangelo (this is the proper spelling, BTW) for women is classified as a luxurious, flowery fragrance. It possesses a blend of floral with notes of rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang and lily of the valley, finishing with sandalwood and musk. It is recommended for evening wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One really neat thing about the bottle - as you can see, there is smokey glass at the top and bottom of a silvery canister - there are actually TWO bottles of the perfume, totaling the 3.4 oz. of perfume.  I think this is very cool, personally.  Then again, I&#x27;m easily amused.  The shower gel is scented the same as the perfume and full of lots of bubbles.  The lotion is nice and thick and luxurious - very moisturizing.  By using the shower gel, putting on the lotion and then topping it with the perfume you can make the scent last all day long with little need for a touch up - the art of layering.</li>
    <li> This a fantastic product, a smell from the past when the things were more real.  A drop of this spicy perfume last the whole day.</li>
    <li> Bellagio is okay but kind of weak.  The odor wears off VERY FAST.  Nice smell but like I said, kind of weak.</li>
    <li> This is a very lovely,light scent.  I would definitely order it again and probably will when I run out!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t receive this perfume set yet and so i am getting everyday unhappy for the delay its taking even more than extra 2 days than the regular shipping its almost a week and i didn&#x27;t receive anything and showing longer than that ,, i couldn&#x27;t even cancel it if i could i would do ,, i wanted it to give it as a gift for a special event and i am disappointed i would prefer to go to a store and get something better .. if you want it quick d&#x27;ont buy it from here .</li>
    <li> I bought this set as a gift for my mother and fell in love. She loves it, I love it. The floral, fresh, musk combination is amazing, all achieved without a strong overwhelming scent.

    <li> It&#x27;s good buy for it&#x27;s price on Amazon.   However, both of my purchased perfume was leaked in the box, I did not bother to return them.</li>
    <li> I loved Jessica McClinktock until I put it on! This perfume is also a lily of the valley floral but nowhere near as strong smelling! I layer the bodywash, lotion and perfum and it lasts all day without being too strong. I have been wearing Realities for Women for years and recently began experimenting for new fragrances along that same line. I have found this one, Lily Pulitzer \\&quot;Beachy\\&quot;, Coach Signature, Mon Classique de Morabito and Cabotine de Gres to wear that are all florals and are all now my favorites! I am not stuck with only one! All the ones I listed above are light florals. They are all on AMAZON at WONDERFUL prices!</li>
    <li> I had first found Michaelangelo scent at the  Bellagio casino in LV several years ago. When I later returned to the casino I  could not buy it there anymore. I am delighted that I searched the web and found the Comlpete set!&lt;br /&gt;I love the mixed flora scent.It is the scent that the casino pumped into there public areas.&lt;br /&gt;This  package  has all that is needed to layer scent without being overpowering.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for her birthday and she loves the scent of this and I do also and many people have commented I love the smell of your perfume when she is out in the public.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful scent.  This product was delivered on time and was exactly what I expected.  It is a wonderful product and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Stay away! you will smell like strong peppers. No one would like to stay near you. I had to break the bottle and put in in the trash can for no one else to use it. Every  one who tried, asked me how and where the h*** did I get it from. Not worth</li>
    <li> This product looks beautiful but it smells horrific!  Made me nauseous and would not recommend that an animal where this!!!</li>
    <li> Package was damaged in that the shower get burst open from the cold. Therefore, I could not use this item as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;One of the worst transactions through Amazon I have experienced.</li>
    <li> I have had this product before!!! It is an excellent fragrance!!!!!! I could not find it and luckily for me Amazon.com had it!!!!! Thanks Amazon.com!!!!</li>
    <li> when received the perfume it was open... n product was oozin out...every order....ive had two replacements and they wer all the same...i will be very cautious when oredering beauty products.!same thing with other perfume orders...one looked like water n it was jessica mclintock...very weak n im an avid fan of jm</li>
    <li> Never smelled this scent but took a chance and sent as a gift-recipient said fragrance was pretty and light and was happy with gift.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is considered by some to be a jewel of perfumes and I can not generalize, but I do not feel well, I&#x27;m light brown and this fragrance does not favor my pH. Before continuing my review of this item select your fragrance according to your own tastes.</li>
    <li> The parfum was original but the lotions had no smell at all and the lotions did not have original design as the parfum.  Not satisifed with the honesty of product.</li>
    <li> Did not smell right. This was not the real thing. I did not use it</li>
    <li> My Wife loved it &amp; I believe you would too. This is a very nice product for gifting to some one near &amp; dear. It was delivered in time as expected, the price is reasonable &amp; it has a very good fragrance.</li>
    <li> The Item is good, but the packaging is poor, the shower gel crimp had a leak and the almost all of the gel spilled inside the package. However the Body Lotion and the Perfume are in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please check the items condition before shipping to customer.</li>
    <li> the fragrance is light , it last about 15 minutes . i love the lotion and shower gel.use them together it will last about 30 mins</li>
    <li> i purchase this for mothers day for my sister in law she likes this perfume a lot she was so happy with the perfume great buy</li>
    <li> I like the perfume even though it seemed that I had to spray on more throughout the day. Okay product.</li>
    <li> This product has a floral fragrance, very fresh and the price is right. I enjoy it very mucho on her.</li>
    <li> I had ordered this product for a gift.  I am told it was a hit with the lady who received it.</li>
    <li> Okay, I bought this as a gift for a friend for Christmas but was so disappointed no words are adequate. The smell itslelf was somewhat similar to rubbing alcohol but with a distinct odor that difficult to describe. It was&#x27;nt sweet, or musky or soft or bold....it was best defined as medicinal. It kinda reminded me of medicine, (referring to the liquid spray). The lotion was bland. The packaging looked better in a photo but felt like something cheap, like the leftovers from an outlet store. Obviously, I do not recommend this product except as a gag gift.</li>
    <li> I would definitely buy this again. it was exactly what i was looking for. except i hate theses rating surveys</li>
