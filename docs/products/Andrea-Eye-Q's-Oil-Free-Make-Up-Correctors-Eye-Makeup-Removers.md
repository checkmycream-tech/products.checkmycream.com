    <li> Use - fixing eyeliner mistakes&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s the shape of the qtip was perfect&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s the amount of liquid on the qtip was way to much making a small mistake a big mistake&lt;br /&gt;Result - great in theory not so much in practice, bk to using plain old qtips</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product (Andrea Eye Qs Eye Makeup Correctors) for around a year now and I love it! There&#x27;s no greasy, oily film and it makes the tiniest corrections to a mascara or eyeliner goof a breeze, unlike a big remover pad. The only problem is that it&#x27;s hard to find so I&#x27;m going to buy a dozen of them online right now to be sure I don&#x27;t run out!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, deleivery quick price right, sometimes its difficult to find in the stores Amazon always has what I need.</li>
    <li> These work great and I like them, however they dry out before I&#x27;m half done with the contents.  I used another brand of a similar product but it was discontinued, too, so this is a lesser substitute, especially if it can&#x27;t be fully used before I finish the contents.</li>
    <li> I HEARD TODAY THESE ARE DISCONTINUED!  OMG! NO WAY....HOPEFULLY PLANET BEAUTY WORKER IS MISTAKEN! I LOVE THESE I KEEP ONE CONTAINER IN MY CAR, ONE IN MY WORKOUT BAG, ONE AT WORK AND ONE AT HOME ....NEVER LEAVE ANYWHERE WITHOUT THEM...I HAVE OILY SKIN AND EVEN WITH WATERPROOF MASCARA MY EYES GET BLACK SMUDGES UNDER THESE SAVE MY LIFE!</li>
    <li> For over a year I have reordered this product.  They are great for cleaning up the eyelid and under eye after application of mascara and eyeliner.  I am always sure to have one extra on hand at all times.  This is a product I will not be without.</li>
    <li> These are a must have. Take off smudges and racoon eyes. So easy, and so great.</li>
    <li> Great for removing mascara under your eyes after make up.  Easy to travel with. Great for make up mistakes.  Will not irritate eyes.  Not oily.</li>
    <li> A must have for at home and for make-up artists!! This product is fast and very convienient to use and does not leave any residue!!</li>
    <li> I have tried other products like this, but for me, these really are the best.  If you want to try a worthwhile product, try these Eye Q swabs!</li>
    <li> These work for what i need them for.</li>
    <li> I used to get this product in a pharmacy and now its only available over the net. This is very convenient way to fix an eye makeup,mascara runs. Q-tips soaked in gentle, non-irritating solution.Love this product.Also recommend moisturizing makeup remover pads.</li>
    <li> Great product, good for removing makeup mistakes.</li>
    <li> They do the job for the most part. I like the pointed tip that makes it unique over just a regular qtip.</li>
    <li> I am the world&#x27;s messiest eye makeup applier.  I make a total mess of my eyelids with mascara and these little pre-moistened jewels erase all of the mess quickly and I&#x27;m on my way.  I absolutely love them, they do not leave any fibers behind like a cotton swab does.  I truly cannot live without them, so I hope they don&#x27;t ever stop making them.</li>
    <li> I really like these moist pointed q-tips, they are great for fixing makeup errors and finishing touches.  I have found many uses for them.</li>
    <li> I really like this product a lot. It works beautifully. I have found nothing on the market to equal it. It manages to remove those unwanted smudges when using mascara.</li>
    <li> A must have for anyone who wears eye makeup. Easy to use, it takes off what you want and leaves what you want. Would repurchase.</li>
    <li> I wear lash extensions and have to have oil free makeup remover.  These swipe over and under easily to remove without any risk to my costly lashes  :)</li>
    <li> Bought two of these after reading product reviews. It does exactly what it says it does. I use it after applying my make-up - you&#x27;ll be surprised how much eye make-up settles in the wrong places. My only wish is that they didn&#x27;t dry out so easily. One container I didn&#x27;t close tight enough but the second seemed to get dry by the last half dozen or so. Just make sure you close it tight.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because I was familiar with it but could not find it in any stores here in Hawaii. The swabs are an efficient way to make corrections to your eye makeup.</li>
    <li> This product makes for precise cleanup of eye makeup. I like that even when using heavy, dark shades, they won&#x27;t smudge if I need to correct even a larger area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars only because I feel like the swabs are maybe a little too saturated with the solution. I think that is the reason it did irritate my eye just a little, which caused some tearing up. That&#x27;s no good when doing eye makeup, of course!</li>
    <li> Love this product, especially the tiny pointed end which is great for removing globs of misplaced mascara.  Use the excess to clean off my cream eyeliner brush!</li>
    <li> These q-tips are terrific. Gave to everyone for Christmas. Have gotten great reviews from all the grand daughters. They are very soft to the skin and yet are affective in taking away all the little mistakes I make.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t really wipe up anything, even when wearing just mascara. It just smears all the mascara/eye makeup around, leaving raccoon eyes and a mess. You still have to use a face wipe or something to wipe off the makeup. One q-tip does not go a long way, depending on how much eye makeup you want to smear and loosen up before taking it off. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I always smudge mascara on my eyelids when applying it to my lashes, so this has been a convenient tool for swiping all the mess off!</li>
    <li> You should never be without these if you were makeup and care how you look with it on.  They are perfect for making your makeup job perfect.</li>
    <li> to have these little pre-moistened swabs for any smudges or smears which often occur while putting on eye make-up.  They do the trick and actually, can be used more than once, which might not be recommended, but I do it anyway.  When I run out of these, I&#x27;ll reorder, for sure!</li>
    <li> These work great for removing wayward mascara under my eyes and fixing mistakes so my eyeliner goes on in the sharp cat eye I like. These are hard to find so I&#x27;m glad I found them here.</li>
    <li> I love these make up remover sticks and I use them daily. They quickly and accurately remove whatever you want removed, without destroying all of your eye make up, unless that&#x27;s what you are trying to do! Great accessory and easy to travel with the pre-moistened q-tio like sticks.</li>
    <li> If you use eye-makeup, these will make the application much less stressful. You can even out liner and swab away smudges without disrupting the look you&#x27;ve achieved.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Fast and easy to use. Open jar and apply immediately.  No fuss, No mess.  Toss Out.  LOVE</li>
