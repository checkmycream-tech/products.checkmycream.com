<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is one of our long-time family-favorite EOs.  The fragrance is wonderful.  Oddly, though, my family collectively agrees that for some reason, if we are cooking at the same time that this fragrance is being used, it smells terrible!!  Consistently, when we cook, we must stop using this oil and resume after the meal is over.  So if you try it, keep that in mind.</li>
    <li> Another quality oil from Young Living. Great for use with DIY deodorant as well as other issues!</li>
    <li> Just buy through Young Living.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works well.  Love it</li>
    <li> I was told that someone used this as a &amp;#34;spot treatment&amp;#34; on occasional acne, and it has worked wonders.  It has many other uses too, but this stuff is amazing!  It is a great price too.  My first order was lost in the mail, and Amazon issued a refund and paid for 1 day delivery of another item.  Very great customer service and a great product overall.  Will be a continued purchaser of this!</li>
    <li> It seems to work as intended.  I use a drop on my feet when I feel a little congestion and it goes away.</li>
    <li> This is significantly more expensive than buying from Young Living directly and you have no way to guarantee you are getting pure oil.</li>
    <li> love the fresh scent. I mixed it with some tea tree oil in a sprayer with water and it really freshens up a room, i just wish it lingered longer</li>
    <li> My daughter is asthmatic and I started using this as an alternative to her breathing treatment. Works amazing. I recommend to everyone. I do however blend 2 drops of organic olive oil with 2 drops of RC oil and rub on her chest and back for the best results!</li>
    <li> This oil is potent so a few drops is all you need. I diffuse it in a room I&#x27;m not in and let the fragrance &amp;#34;flow&amp;#34; to the rest of the house. It freshens drains, toilets and removes odors.</li>
    <li> mix it in a spray bottle of water w/ 5 -10 drops of this...spray throughout the house.  Refreshes everything!  You can also spray in your gym shoes, gym bag, pillows, hair.  Smells like ginger</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  Got 40 mosquito bites at one time.  This worked better than cortisone or other OTC creams.  Tyou Young Living!</li>
    <li> This oil blend fills the house with wonderful aroma!  I love it.  I was hoping for a blend that made me feel good and this is it.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I was told to buy by a friend - and it&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I use it with a touch of lavender for a &amp;#34;cleansing the area&amp;#34; spray.</li>
    <li> This oil is awesome, Does just what it says, purify.  Arrived on time and is a perfect part to my collection and use of essential oils.</li>
    <li> We use to remove warts and does excellent job. They get soft and fall right off. E O is the way to go.</li>
    <li> This is amazing, incredible stuff! My first time, ever, using essential oils, and I am so happy I chose Purification, especially because it is Summer Time, and it works for a ton of Summer Time woes. My reason for getting it in the first place was to use in my laundry, due to these stinking - literally- front loaders causing my clothes to smell bad, I read online to use a few drops of this and it would get rid of those types of bad smells and I also just read it in a review!&lt;br /&gt;I just received my Purification Oil and haven&#x27;t had the chance yet, to use it for that.&lt;br /&gt;As I am sitting on my back deck,  reading all other reviews, a common house fly is bugging me, flying all around my drink, face, hair, etc, so I decided to get my Purification oil, and rub a little on my coffee mug, as well on the cracks of my lips, main reason I was going to use it TODAY, anyway (after reading that it helps cold sores) and that fly tried to light one more time, and it hasn&#x27;t been back since!!!!! It has been about an hour since I began this review, and no more flies! This is the best stuff in the world and all natural. As I get to get back to nature and basics in my life, I will definitely be trying other scents of this line!! Looking forward to fresher laundry and I DETEST FLIES!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful oil.  Young Living is one of the top brands of essential oils available.  However, the price of this product was FAR above what a local Young Living distributor would charge you.  I asked a relative who sells these products to be sure.</li>
    <li> What a great fragrance to put in a diffuser to make your home clean and fresh smelling.  With our allergies we need to have&lt;br /&gt;some kind of air freshener to assist in keeping our air with less dry too.  Great product for us.</li>
    <li> Every year I get stung by bees- yellow jackets- wasps whatever  all kinds of bees.&lt;br /&gt;The first year I got stung on my thumb reading the paper outside on my porch. After I got stung I ran in the house immediately and I put ammonia on it to take the  stinging pain out... im highly allergic to bees and their family&lt;br /&gt;Then I got my purification oil and I kept dabbing it on my thumb&lt;br /&gt;yes it hurt like the dickens and was wondering if I should go to the hospital but decided not..&lt;br /&gt;if you catch it right away  do it  put purification on it  keep doing it for  6 days that&#x27;s what I had to do with mine... and alotta ice to relieve the swelling and inflammation.&lt;br /&gt;I also put lavender on every other time and then purification.... I have no scars of where I have been stung- I only have stories and I can tell you where they have stung me on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;I keep a bottle at home and a bottle in my purse at all times  since im highly allergic to the B family.&lt;br /&gt;I cant take Benadryl  im allergic to that and most over the counter medicines-- also the medication the Dr. gives me im allergic so I have to do and find something that is fast and easy on my body.&lt;br /&gt;Ive been doing YLO for over 10 years now and I love what they do for me. Trying to get all my friends to buy YLO because they are just soooo good for you, better than medicines.&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant smell and it can be used for a perfume with a little coconut liquid oil, or grapeseed oil.</li>
    <li> I purchased this essential oil on recommendation from my massage therapist.  I love the citrusy scent, I use it with a diffuser and it makes my home smell fresher.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I used Purification oil topically for poison ivy.  When exposed to sunlight, I broke out in horrible hives that lasted for a month.  You won&#x27;t read that in the YLO literature but the dermatologist said they see 5 to 7 people a week that have had bad, sometimes life threatening reactions to essential oils.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast and without damage</li>
    <li> My son is very allergic to mosquito/bug bites. One drop of this and the itch/sting is gone. It prevents the skin from irritation/swelling from the bite. Its a small container but very potent!</li>
    <li> The oil is great, and I trust the brand, but although the bottle seemed to be packed correctly and the seal had not been broken, it had leaked. At this price, a leak is not to be tolerated. I have no idea who&#x27;s at fault, but I am not 100% pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I run a daycare out of my home and it always smelled like dirty diapers untill I started putting this in my Essential Oils air mister.&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> I love YL essential oils and I use this as an air freshener in my home and car. I use 2-3 drops in water in a 1 oz spray bottle and spray as needed.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for many years and it&#x27;s a must for the medicine cabinet. It is good for insect bites swelling and infections.  I use it for colds and it helps me to get better right away. Always take it with me as I have allergies.</li>
    <li> love love this product, 6 gtts in a 4 oz spray bottle and use it to freshen up your house. kills ants and fleas. put a gtt on cotton ball place in bottom of garbage can smells clean and frsh</li>
    <li> i ordered another one. smells great!</li>
    <li> Young Living Essential Oil-Purification, perfect to remove smoking smells, love this frgrance, I use this oil every night while I sleep.</li>
    <li> I like this oil a lot. It does the job. It gets rid of odors after cooking and gives your room a fresh smell.</li>
    <li> Purification is great to freshen up a stale room. Instead of using chemicals like Febreeze or lysol, I use Purification.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this blend. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is what I wanted thanks</li>
    <li> It does get smells out of your house.  Hubby could not tell I had fish for lunch when he got home at dinnertime. Left a little lemon grass smell.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, I use it to purify all areas in kitchen and bathroom . Love the scent</li>
    <li> Love this stuff makes my house smell so nice!</li>
    <li> A pleasant aroma and effective all-natural bug repellent.  Hooray!&lt;br /&gt;Used on kids and dogs.  Did not work against fleas on dogs.&lt;br /&gt;Effective for mosquitoes, ticks, noseeums . . .</li>
    <li> These oils are wonderful!  I have purchased many different kinds and have yet to be disappointed.  They work as promised and last a very long time.</li>
    <li> My friend told me to dab it on a cotton and place it inside your shirt when u travel to keep germs away so I think it is a excellent idea u are inhaling homeopathic&lt;br /&gt;Scents</li>
    <li> I am fairly new to essential oils but this one so far is my favorite .&lt;br /&gt;I just ran out of it today so I will be ordering more real soon.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;It was packaged well and arrived in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> The Young Living Purification Essential Oil was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love my purification and the person who sold this was very nice and helpful and contacted me every step of the way Thank you I love the oil.</li>
    <li> very small container for the price but seems to be a good product.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this oil. It&#x27;s wonderful for getting rid of foul odors. I had tried all kinds of sprays and deodorizers that only lasted a few minutes. I used this oil in two rooms and the odor was gone the next day. It really works.</li>
    <li> Purification essential oil is great for clearing up stubborn acne and blemishes. A little goes a lone way. Great seller.</li>
    <li> For an oil essence recipe.</li>
    <li> Came just as stated! Love Young Living oils!</li>
    <li> We have an organic garden on our property, so we do not use dangerous chemicals on our yard, or our animals. Our dog had trouble with fleas. We read a report of using this product to make up homemade flea spray. It worked very well in keeping the fleas away and the dogs skin no longer has dry patches.</li>
    <li> I love the Young Living products!! Fast shipping from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love the smell. But unfortunately a small package</li>
    <li> I wanted to use this to make an odor control spray for my animals bedding. It did not work at all for that purpose. Smell was pleasant when I made the spray, but it did not linger at all. I will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Hands Down my Favorite Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells clean, and amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. This is my favorite YL oil. Smells amazing and a few drops in a spray bottle with water keeps the bugs away.</li>

    <li> I really like the smell of this.</li>
    <li> our daughters use this and love it</li>
    <li> Am super happy with product and with shipping time.</li>
    <li> Great service. This oil is very useful for many conditions. Works on odors and also am using on my cat.</li>
    <li> It was great,  exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> In case anyone is wondering what the scent of &#x27;Purification&#x27; is, it smells similar to that of Lemon Heads candy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;m avoiding antiperspirant deodorant and I read a recommendation on FB to use 2-3 drops of this into each arm pit to avoid body odor... I made the purchase and it has worked wonderfully. No sensitivity like I had to products with baking soda, a few drops 1 time a day and no body odor.</li>
    <li> I like this oil the best for my allergies. It not only helps me breathe better it takes the odors out of the room.  I will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> one of my FAVE essential oils - use it for laundry</li>
    <li> A must have in my house.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied!!! Great delivery amazing product! Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> This is a great essential oil blend for several uses:  to repel insects (namely mosquitoes), to take away the sting of insect bites (namely mosquitoes), and to help heal insect bites with broken skin.  I bought it because my son was constantly being bitten by mosquitoes and needed something to give him relief.  The smell is pleasant; I would recommend this to anyone who wants a formula to help with insect repellent and to minimize the sting of insect bites as well.</li>
    <li> This is awesome in a diffuser!! It smells great and does take away nasty odors!!</li>
    <li> love the essential oils</li>
    <li> I thought all of these oils were quackery and pseudo-science. Anyways, I put about 3 or 4 drops into a bath and my hemorrhoid that caused me almost a week of pain instantly went away. Why? No idea, but it works.</li>
    <li> It was just what I was wanting to help kill germs in the air.</li>
    <li> I got this as a flea repellent for my dogs and I added about 10 to 12 drops to water in a 8 oz spray can. My dogs smell great but it has to be reapplied multiple times a day to keep the fleas away.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I heard it helped to repel fleas from dogs. It didn&#x27;t work for that. Not sure what else to use it for but bug repelling. It is strong due to the citronella.</li>
    <li> This has a clean, uplifting scent.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest at taking care of bad foot odor and ruining shoes. Love it.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, but is a little more expensive than I would have liked to spend on such a small bottle.</li>
    <li> Talk about purifying the air.. If u don&#x27;t have a diffuser, get one.</li>
    <li> We are always pleased and completely satisfied with everything that we purchase from Amazon!</li>
    <li> I love the product just make sure when you order your getting the correct size.  I thought I purchased 15 ml for the price, but when received I found I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the quantity.  My mistake, lesson learned. The brand is way too expensive for me!</li>
