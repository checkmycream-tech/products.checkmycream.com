      <li>An old perfume but smells so good</li>
      <li>I fell in love with this scent -- it is light and very feminine!</li>
      <li>I have been wearing Destiny as my basic fragrance for many, many years and continue to love it.  </li>
      <li>Try it first and make sure it&#x27;s the soft, clean, refreshing &amp;#34;Destiny&amp;#34; fragrance that has been around for many years.  </li>
      <li>SCENT IS ALSO FULL OF A LIGHT CARNATION AND A SWEET ALMOST HONEY LIKE SCENT.</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite scent.  </li>
      <li>i used this clean fresh scent years ago.</li>

      <li>A little boy in the park told me I smelled better than candy!</li>
      <li>So while the price is reasonable, the delivery system for the fragrance renders this purchase a nuisance rather than a pleasure to use.</li>
      <li>thanks will buy again</li>
      <li>However,  what ever was in this bottle was not the real thing.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for carrying it.</li>
      <li>Neither does it smell like the real fragrance.  </li>
      <li>The product arrived well-packaged and in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for years and this did not smell like the real thing</li>
      <li>I FEEL ITS A CLASSIC.</li>
      <li>Destiny is made up of all white flowers and is a very pretty scent.  </li>
      <li>I had a man in New York tell me he followed me for blocks because of the scent.  </li>
      <li>its big enough that you&#x27;ll be able to find it and the same thing about being on your dresser.</li>
      <li>Oddly, when I used this perfume spray a couple of times, it did not smell at all like the original Destiny by Marilyn Miglin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this cologne for years and far prefer it over Miglin&#x27;s stronger scent Pheromone.</li>
      <li>It smells old.  </li>
      <li>the one that was sent was old.</li>
      <li>and will always order it before I am completely out of it.</li>
      <li>Destiny is a soft smelling cologne,not overbearing on the wearer or people around you.  </li>
      <li>It has a soft floral scent and is not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>My mom had an old bottle with barely any left</li>
      <li>WHAT A VERY FEMININE WOMAN SHOULD SMELL LIKE DELICATE BUT ABSOLUTELY</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this particular box of Destiny was old and sitting on a shelf for years somewhere</li>

    <li> There is not a Marilyn Miglin cologne or perfume that doesn&#x27;t smell exceptionally  good. You only need a little spritz of this cologne to last all day.  A great scent!!!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> it just doesn&#x27;t have the same fragrance it used to  have...maybe they have changed the formula...i have worn this fragrance since the early nineties and am very disappointed in how is smells now.</li>
    <li> Have used this perfume for 10 years and receive compliments from strangers often.  Just love it.  Thanks for carrying it.</li>
    <li> I had used this product years ago when I watched Home Shopping  One day I was shopping online and found it so I purchased it</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Destiny as my basic fragrance for many, many years and continue to love it.  Great, light fragrance, not overpowering.  The price on Amazon for the 3.3 ounce edp spray is significantly less than the fragrance websites.  I am extremely pleased with this entire order and delivery timeframe.  Amazon rules!!!</li>
    <li> This perfume is amazing! My mom had an old bottle with barely any left and I fell in love with it. I usually prefer wearing body mists because most perfumes are too strong for me. This scent is light but not too light. It lasts long as well and it just smells overall great. I don&#x27;t know how to describe the scent besides amazing.. it is definitely worth your money. And the bottle is a great size, won&#x27;t take up a lot of room in your purse but its big enough that you&#x27;ll be able to find it and the same thing about being on your dresser.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift as this is her favorite perfume.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells wonderful. Have used faithfully for years. A terrific price. I would recommend this product to anyone you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> The is by far one of my favorite colognes.  It has a soft floral scent and is not overpowering.  The frangrance lasts through the day.  Every time I wear this cologne I get compliments.  I use cologne sparingly too.  No one appreciates when someone oversprays and leaves a lingering scent.  I&#x27;ve used this cologne for years and far prefer it over Miglin&#x27;s stronger scent Pheromone.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this scent -- it is light and very feminine! The product arrived well-packaged and in a reasonable amount of time. However, for some reason the spray button doesn&#x27;t work properly. When you push the button down, the liquid dribbles down the side of the bottle. This situation is very disappointing. So while the price is reasonable, the delivery system for the fragrance renders this purchase a nuisance rather than a pleasure to use.</li>
    <li> i used this clean fresh scent years ago. it a great scent. packaged well and arrived sooner than expected. buy it you will love it, soft pretty scent. thanks will buy again</li>
    <li> I am sending this back.  It smells old.  I have a little left in my bottle and when I compared them this one smelled sour.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite scent.  Very light, and I receive many comments on it.  I have used it for years, and never tire off it.</li>
    <li> An old perfume but smells so good and you need very little.  People who squirt three or four times need to stop.  YOU ARE OVERWHELMING w/your scent.</li>
    <li> Destiny is a soft smelling cologne,not overbearing on the wearer or people around you.  Lv this cologne and will always order it before I am completely out of it.</li>
    <li> Each and every day that I wear this fragrance, I receive nothing but compliments.  A fresh just getting out of the shower fragrance and can be worn anytime of the year.</li>
    <li> bought this for my girlfriend.  she has used this before.  the one that was sent was old. and smelled.  i sent this one back in an effort to get a newer bottle.</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing this perfume for over 15 years elsewhere and love the scent.  Oddly, when I used this perfume spray a couple of times, it did not smell at all like the original Destiny by Marilyn Miglin.  It smelled rancid and not a thing like it&#x27;s supposed to.  Destiny is made up of all white flowers and is a very pretty scent.  I&#x27;m not sure if this particular box of Destiny was old and sitting on a shelf for years somewhere or if it was just a bad counterfeit version.&lt;br /&gt;The Seller offered me to return it which I did over 4 weeks ago but have not yet been issued a credit back to my credit card. Very disappointed.  Won&#x27;t be ordering perfume from this Seller again.</li>
    <li> I have worn this scent for years.  It is spectacular.  I had a man in New York tell me he followed me for blocks because of the scent.  People in grocery stores, at events, at my dentist office, on trains, have told me this scent is beautiful. A little boy in the park told me I smelled better than candy! My husband loves it.  I love it.&lt;br /&gt;It is flowery, but not sweet.  It has deep undertones without being too heavy.  It works for daytime, evening and all times in between.  I am never without it.  Destiny is powerful.  Prepare to be and enchantress.</li>
    <li> Seller is great, satisfied.</li>
    <li> TO ME THIS THE BEST OF ALL THE MEDIUM PRICED FRAGRANCES I HAVE EVER TRIED.THIS WHAT A VERY FEMININE WOMAN SHOULD SMELL LIKE DELICATE BUT ABSOLUTELY INTOXICATINGLY SENSUAL.THIS SCENT IS ALSO FULL OF A LIGHT CARNATION AND A SWEET ALMOST HONEY LIKE SCENT. I FEEL ITS A CLASSIC.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances that has kept it&#x27;s beautiful scent over time. However,  what ever was in this bottle was not the real thing.  It last every bit of 3 minutes once you spray it on.  Neither does it smell like the real fragrance.  Don&#x27;t waste your money here. If you are going to purchase it, go to a local fragrance shop.  Try it first and make sure it&#x27;s the soft, clean, refreshing &amp;#34;Destiny&amp;#34; fragrance that has been around for many years.  I purchased two bottles in which I gave one as a gift.  Now I see why my friend never wears it. It&#x27;s fake...........</li>
    <li> Most Perfumes either give me a headache or make me sneeze Destiny&#x27;s light airy fragrance is perfect for everyday use!</li>
    <li> I buy this every year for my sister in law; it is her fav!</li>
    <li> There was something wrong with this particular bottle. I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for years and this did not smell like the real thing</li>
