    <li> I love the NYX liners. The liners are highly pigmented, which I love. But these colors are awful. They call them lip liner but the colors look more like brow and eyeliner colors. Better off stopping by your nearest Ulta, and picking out the colors in person.</li>
    <li> I like the colors but they arrived unsealed and NYX doesn&#x27;t make these colors anymore. I can&#x27;t be sure they&#x27;re new or authentic - but they&#x27;re good for quick looks and it was cheaper to keep them than send them back...</li>

    <li> Thank you for a great transaction.  The liners are ok just wish they were creamy. I have to really warm them up on the back of my hand to get the color to show up.  I do like the colors they are nice!~</li>
