<li> I think what really bothered me was the initial juniper note.</li>
<li> But the mint doesn&#x27;t back down too far.</li>
<li> My expectation was not very high because I had MEN</li>
<li> I would totally buy it again and recommend to other.  </li>
<li> This is and other product by Angel</li>
<li> My boyfriend has other Thierry Mugler colognes and we like them all.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m disappointed since I love Thierry Mugler stuff.  </li>
<li> I find these base notes almost nonexistent, surely to be missed by anyone who is not trying to sniff you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> The juniper is the stronger note, as it is just a heavy note seemingly wherever I smell it.</li>
<li> But upon my second wearing, I didn&#x27;t hate it as much.</li>
<li> not huge with musk</li>
<li> I absolutely hated this fragrance when I first tried it and resonated with those who gave a thumbs down review.</li>
<li> These notes last for quite a while, eventually to recede into a spicy white pepper note followed by the weak base notes of sequoia wood and patchouli.</li>
<li> /&gt;Nevertheless, with that said, I suppose I understand the negative reviews.</li>
<li> mean theres musk at the beginning&lt;br</li>
<li> one didnt turn out so bad..</li>
<li> bad for my taste..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed since I love Thierry Mugler stuff.  The Juniper is too strong but it is a decent summer sport scent.  I prefer Sunessence over this so if you can get that I would skip this one.</li>
    <li> i got this cologne early than expected and im so happy thanks to &amp;#34;click-n-shop&amp;#34; where i ordered . The smell of this cologne is like a bar of soap and kind of bubble jam but in  a pleasant way , &amp;#34;clean smell &amp;#34;  .Highly recommended .</li>
    <li> this was never represented as a new scent and only shown as a different scent from the original...only different color packaging as is often offered. I was refused a return and encouraged by an upcoming refund, to order another which I was certain was the correct Angel men&#x27;s scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has lost my and families business...with their rotten triple satisfaction policy. Beware my friends.</li>
    <li> I love when I smell better than every other guy but no one knows what it is I&#x27;m wearing so I say its something else to through them off, cant have a room of  men smelling the same lol.</li>
    <li> I rated this high.  This spray on my man smell so good.  I would totally buy it again and recommend to other.  There is nothing that I can think of that I this like about it.  This is and other product by Angel I will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> It smells like a milder B Men. I get several compliments and it mellows nice as the day goes on.</li>
    <li> Que aroma tan agradable</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Easter. We both love the way it smells. My boyfriend has other Thierry Mugler colognes and we like them all. They each have a unique scent.</li>
    <li> Smells like heaven. Love this cologne. Lasts all day and I never tire of it. For nights I prefer angel for men.</li>
    <li> Smell very nice, modest sillage and unfortunetly it last less longer than I would have wished.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it though</li>
    <li> Awesome this is a really nice perfume, I recommend this for everybody</li>
    <li> The fragrance comes in a neatly packaged white and blue box, when you open you can smell frozen mint, and juniper extracts! It smells so good! I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son at Christmas and he likes it and i liked the price.  Has a great smell</li>
    <li> Bought this on impulse and am loving it!  the scent is wonderful and to make things even better, this is a limited edition which I cannot get anymore in Singapore.  Thanks Amazon!  And cheaper than buying it at ANY retail shop in Singapore!  How amazing is that!</li>
    <li> My expectation was not very high because I had MEN AND I found it too sweet and strong.&lt;br /&gt;This new version is not very sweet FABULOUS BALANCED AND LASTING SMELL FRESH WITH SPECIAL DYNAMIC recommend for those who want to be bold and luscious with an adrenaline rush.</li>
    <li> I just love Amazon this website is so awesome, my husband love this new Thierry Mugler Angel Men. The order is always on time and the quality of the item is good. Amazon is the first item on my list for Christmas.</li>
    <li> PS begins with the top notes of freezing mint and juniper. The juniper is the stronger note, as it is just a heavy note seemingly wherever I smell it. But the mint doesn&#x27;t back down too far. It is still there, and it provides a bit of a chill. These notes last for quite a while, eventually to recede into a spicy white pepper note followed by the weak base notes of sequoia wood and patchouli. I find these base notes almost nonexistent, surely to be missed by anyone who is not trying to sniff you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say this is the first fragrance where I have done a complete 180. I absolutely hated this fragrance when I first tried it and resonated with those who gave a thumbs down review. I was in solidarity with everything they said. But upon my second wearing, I didn&#x27;t hate it as much. After a couple more times, I just had to admit that I really liked PS. I think what really bothered me was the initial juniper note. I wasn&#x27;t crazy about juniper, although PS really helped me to learn to en joy it. But I didn&#x27;t &#x60;get&#x27; the juniper note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, with that said, I suppose I understand the negative reviews. When I first smelled this, I never thought I would learn to enjoy this. I think it&#x27;s definitely worth trying a decanted sample.</li>
    <li> Ok, Well since im used to Theirry Mugler smelling like a musk rat&lt;br /&gt;this one didnt turn out so bad..&lt;br /&gt;I mean theres musk at the beginning&lt;br /&gt;and then it mellows out to a citrusy cool relaixng smell...&lt;br /&gt;Not bad for my taste..&lt;br /&gt;Just not huge with musk</li>
