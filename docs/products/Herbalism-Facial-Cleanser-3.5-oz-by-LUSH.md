### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The scent on this cleanser isn&#x27;t the greatest, and I can understand where people say this smells like vinegar.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this stuff before, and I wasn&#x27;t impressed with it at all.</li>
      <li>This is great stuff!</li>
      <li>This stuff smells and feels soo good on my skin!</li>
      <li>Works great for my acne prone skin</li>
      <li>Smells and feels great.</li>
      <li>Good luck.</li>
      <li>love this product!</li>
      <li>All Lush products are amazing!!!</li>
      <li>All organic and work very fast!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I decided to give this gem another try.</li>
      <li>Not to mention the top was off when I recieved the package.</li>
      <li>Knowing this,it still is the best thing for the occasional break out.</li>
      <li>, she said this was great for oily, sensitive skin...</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve seen a huge change on my skin already</li>
      <li>I really like it - leaves your face clean but not overly-dry like most acne products</li>
      <li>It is a basic good scrub</li>
      <li>My face keeps from being shiny for majority of the day which is nice, and my skins still feels soft by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>Your set with Herbalism and dark angels!!!!!:)))))) LOVE!!!</li>
      <li>This stuff is perfect for a week or two to control breakouts, but I love my Angels on Bare Skin for everyday use.</li>
      <li>actually love all of Lush&#x27;s products!</li>
      <li>what, by the breakouts have not been fun.</li>
      <li>The smell is tolerable and the texture is nice on my skin, but the breakouts have been moderate to severe.</li>
      <li>I originally went into LUSH to purchase Dark Angels but after speaking to the associate (who had beautiful skin) for a while about my needs she suggested Herbalism.  </li>
      <li>I have very, very acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>From the first day I noticed a difference.  </li>
      <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about it, the smell was different then what I was used to but don&#x27;t be deterred by it.</li>
      <li>Leaves my face feeling soft and clean.</li>
      <li>I am really happy with this product and think it will replace all of my other facial cleansers.</li>
      <li>I really do like this face wash.</li>
      <li>I dont really see how it sops off oil like the description says.</li>
      <li>It seems very peculiar that the sticker on the front is ripped off where it would tell you the amount and price for the given amount.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very dissapointed.  </li>
      <li>My face felt very soft after the first use</li>
      <li>Seriously, I&#x27;ll never buy anything else for the rest of my life.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite for an everyday cleanser though, because it is not moisturizing at all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this facial cleanser since July 4th (a little over 2 weeks now) and I must say that I am in LOVE!  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, and I am nervous about trying new products on my face, but I figured, what the hell</li>
      <li>and I recieved it in the clear one.  </li>
      <li>I am going to go to the Lush store &amp; see if it is feaux or not.</li>
      <li>However, I was suffering some breakouts, and a lady at Lush recommended me to try this again.</li>
      <li>my whole life that will clean my skin without drying it out or irritating it.  </li>
      <li>However, I don&#x27;t know if its an actual Lush or a feaux.</li>
      <li>the picture shows that its full and it came and didnt fill the small container</li>

<li> NOT ALL NATURAL OR ECO-FRIENDLY AS PRESENTED ON THEIR WEBSITE where ingredients like ethylamine oxide are oddly listed as such, but a simple web search will show you that actually such ingredients are quite the opposite and likely toxic.  </li>
<li> The wash is very VERY thick &amp; clumpy and its super hard to wash with it.</li>
<li> I instantly switched back to my normal acne treatment, but the whole experience was horrible.</li>
<li> Also was expecting it to come in the black container like the picture</li>
<li> when this gets empty which will probably be soon, Ive been useing it everyday!</li>
<li> Been using it for a little over a month</li>
<li> I just take a pinch of it, mix with a few drops of water in my palm, rub my hands together and rub it into my face.  </li>
<li> Not sure why I received this with the sticker on the front ripped off?  </li>
<li> :/ wtf</li>
<li> the product takes a little bit to get used to, but it isn&#x27;t so bad.  </li>
<li> but it is disgusting.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love this product! actually love all of Lush&#x27;s products!</li>
    <li> this smells like vinegar with God knows what but it is disgusting.</li>
    <li> Leaves my face feeling soft and clean. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about it, the smell was different then what I was used to but don&#x27;t be deterred by it. Smells and feels great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to like this product, but my face has been breaking out since I&#x27;ve been using it. The smell is tolerable and the texture is nice on my skin, but the breakouts have been moderate to severe. I don&#x27;t know if this product is purify my skin or what, by the breakouts have not been fun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a facial cleanser my whole life that will clean my skin without drying it out or irritating it.  This is it!!!!  At 36, I still have issues with acne.  I&#x27;ve never found anything I can use on a daily basis to keep the breakouts from occurring until now.  Seriously, I&#x27;ll never buy anything else for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> I dont really see how it sops off oil like the description says. It is a basic good scrub</li>
    <li> This is great stuff! I have to say it&#x27;s been helping me with my skin especially during the summer time! Been using it for a little over a month and I&#x27;ve seen a huge change on my skin already</li>
    <li> I was recently turned onto these products.  I needed a face scrub and so I got this. I really like it - leaves your face clean but not overly-dry like most acne products</li>
    <li> the picture shows that its full and it came and didnt fill the small container :/ wtf</li>
    <li> Acne??? Here&#x27;s the one for you!!!! All Lush products are amazing!!! All organic and work very fast!!! Your set with Herbalism and dark angels!!!!!:)))))) LOVE!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this facial cleanser since July 4th (a little over 2 weeks now) and I must say that I am in LOVE!  I originally went into LUSH to purchase Dark Angels but after speaking to the associate (who had beautiful skin) for a while about my needs she suggested Herbalism.  I have very sensitive skin, and I am nervous about trying new products on my face, but I figured, what the hell, she said this was great for oily, sensitive skin...let me just try it.  From the first day I noticed a difference.  My face felt very soft after the first use, so moisturized that I didn&#x27;t even use a facial moisturizer.  And I still don&#x27;t.  My face keeps from being shiny for majority of the day which is nice, and my skins still feels soft by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the product takes a little bit to get used to, but it isn&#x27;t so bad.  I just take a pinch of it, mix with a few drops of water in my palm, rub my hands together and rub it into my face.  Then rinse.  I am really happy with this product and think it will replace all of my other facial cleansers.</li>
    <li> I have very, very acne prone skin. For whatever reason I broke out like hell after using this for one week. I instantly switched back to my normal acne treatment, but the whole experience was horrible.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff before, and I wasn&#x27;t impressed with it at all. However, I was suffering some breakouts, and a lady at Lush recommended me to try this again. I&#x27;m glad I decided to give this gem another try. Within a week, my breakouts had been dramatically minimized. The scent on this cleanser isn&#x27;t the greatest, and I can understand where people say this smells like vinegar. Knowing this,it still is the best thing for the occasional break out. It&#x27;s not my favorite for an everyday cleanser though, because it is not moisturizing at all. This stuff is perfect for a week or two to control breakouts, but I love my Angels on Bare Skin for everyday use.</li>
    <li> NOT ALL NATURAL OR ECO-FRIENDLY AS PRESENTED ON THEIR WEBSITE where ingredients like ethylamine oxide are oddly listed as such, but a simple web search will show you that actually such ingredients are quite the opposite and likely toxic.  Good luck.</li>
    <li> Not sure why I received this with the sticker on the front ripped off?  I had this same container before with the same amount in it and I paid around $16 for it.  I paid $30 for this one including the shipping and I&#x27;m very dissapointed.  It seems very peculiar that the sticker on the front is ripped off where it would tell you the amount and price for the given amount. What a rip off.  Also was expecting it to come in the black container like the picture and I recieved it in the clear one.  Not to mention the top was off when I recieved the package.</li>
    <li> I really do like this face wash. However, I don&#x27;t know if its an actual Lush or a feaux. The wash is very VERY thick &amp; clumpy and its super hard to wash with it. You have to use a lot of water &amp; rub it together. I am going to go to the Lush store &amp; see if it is feaux or not.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells and feels soo good on my skin! I will definitly get another one when this gets empty which will probably be soon, Ive been useing it everyday! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Works great for my acne prone skin</li>
    <li> It came used but it does work</li>
