    <li> This overnight cream really absorbs. It&#x27;s a veritable beauty treatment while one sleeps.&lt;br /&gt;It especially helps those who&#x27;ve lived in the arid Southwest for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Though it&#x27;s fairly expensive, one container lasts a very long time. I recommend Renew to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;Elaine</li>

    <li> This is a pretty thick moisturizer.  I use a number of other products from this company and this is probably my least favorite.  It leaves a bit of a stinging tingling feeling on my face.  I don&#x27;t use it very often so it lasts me a long time.</li>
    <li> This met all my expertations.</li>
    <li> I noticed line reduction after the first time used.</li>
    <li> night cream for dry skin during winter. I use the day time cream in this brand as well and love them both. I often use an oil on&lt;br /&gt;my face under this at night either Argan or a Kiehl&#x27;s oil I have. With or without the oil it is a great product for skin on the&lt;br /&gt;dry side and I highly recommend it!</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a couple of years now. And it&#x27;s the one I keep returning to after multiple cosmetics experiments. It doesn&#x27;t work miracles, but it&#x27;s a solid quality night cream.</li>
    <li> This nighttime cream is very nice. I can see an improvement in my skin texture over time and it helps with exfoliation of dry areas, too.</li>
    <li> Great product. It is rich enough and totally non-greasy! Skin feels hydrated in the am when I wake up.&lt;br /&gt;I will reorder this product!</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m happpy with the product but time will tell how I compare it to my other creams.</li>
