    <li> I received the item as promised.  It was well packaged, and the price was excellent.  Smells great, and I am looking forward to using it.</li>
    <li> Because I&#x27;ve never used hyssop oil before, I was unsure what to expect.  However, there was no disappointment with this oil.  At first whiff the scent caught me off guard.  It is a very subtle and sweet fragrance.  After getting used to the scent a couple minutes later, I wanted more.  It&#x27;s clean and refreshing and calmly stimulating.  I put some on my pillow before going to sleep last night along with yarrow and frankincense and had a deep sleep with intense dreams.  Also, I mixed a couple drops with grapefruit oil in replacement of perfume today, which was an excellent combination.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent. Exactly as expected. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Very powerful to use, with all that the media reports about products that suppose to represent what it sells.  I am very satisfied with the Edens Garden essential oils.  Hyssop essential oils are great for many uses.  I found usage for internal and external uses.</li>
    <li> Best in quality, benefit, and cost. The 100% therapeutic grades as well as the Synergy Blends are fabulous. For the price you pay is well worth every penny in beneficial results.</li>
    <li> Love it! Works really well to clear a stuffy nose... I rub it directly on my chest and back and even near my nose to clear my sinuses. I use it on my kids as well. I already finished one bottle and ordered another.</li>
    <li> very impressed with this oil and company. i will be back for more.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. Edens Garden is trustworthy. Their oils are always fresh, packaged will and delivered in a timely manner. There prices are very good. I will always use this company for my oils. They are very effective and beneficial.</li>
    <li> Bought this and many other oils for the wife.  I am thoroughly impressed with the quality of Edens Gardens Essential Oils.  They seem to utilize excellent extraction procedures as well as quality control in the manufacture of their products.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend to anyone interested in essential oils.</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; company!</li>
    <li> I had long read about hyssop but waited over 40 years to sample it&#x27;s essential oil.  As they say, some things are worth waiting for and some gifts come in small packages.  My family enjoyed the experience.</li>
    <li> Came speedy and sealed</li>
    <li> It works people!!!  God is just awesome.</li>
    <li> The quality seems fine, I simply am not finding it helpful for me</li>
    <li> I love essential oils and use them in many DIY preparations.</li>
    <li> Very pleasant aroma.  Soft &amp; soothing.  I got it just to see what it smells like &amp; I love it!  Gave my bottle to my pastor for annointing oil, as it is used for cleansing in the Bible. Just reordered another bottle for myself.  It is in a recipe using yarrow that was in the booklet they sent out to help with sore throat/coughs.  Can&#x27;t wait to get my new order in!</li>
    <li> Hyssop is great for a stuffy nose. I use it as a rub on my kids also. Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to aromatherapy but have purchased oils from different suppliers in the past.  Some I will never buy from again and some I keep on a list of known good brands.  This will be added to my &#x27;buy from again&#x27; list.  Since I&#x27;m new to this, I can&#x27;t offer the chemical/ingredient advise.  I just say this oil/brand is a good one.</li>
    <li> High quality essential oil, exactly as advertised</li>
    <li> Edens Garden are pure, quality oils. I have tried other brands and will always buy from Edens Gardens. Im a consultant for Neal&#x27;s Yard Remedies Organic and they have organic oils made in London, but only make so many available to us in the U.S. so whatever I cannot order from them, I buy from and recommend Edens Garden. I love the fact that EG gives back to YWAM and Teen Challenge. That means a lot and says something about a company.
