      <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
      <li>I feel that it does help to focus, but not as much as I was expecting.</li>
      <li>Fast forward to now, 4th grade.</li>
      <li>Yes, this particular product made that much of a difference.</li>
      <li>But the smell is so odd and overpowering, it garnered more attention than he wanted.</li>
      <li>I went on www.nih.gov as well as researched many scholarly articles regarding the clinical trials done on various essential oils and their efficacy.  </li>

      <li>I am a teacher who has had several of my student&#x27;s parents tell me they were using this (and or other products like it) in lieu of real medicine.</li>
      <li>She still has her good days and her bad days.</li>

    <li> My 7 yo daughter has ADHD.  Her biggest struggle is paying attention and following directions.  We bought this as another thing to try.  It&#x27;s smells pretty strong for a little girl, but I like it.  Her classmates have commented that someone is wearing perfume, but her teacher who lacks a keen sense of smell says it doesn&#x27;t bother her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has eczema and very sensitive skin.  The first time we tried it, we rolled it behind her ears and on her neck.  Her neck got very red and irritated, so we started simply putting it behind her ears.  I did try it on her neck a few times afterwards with the same redness as a result.  We stick to a behind the ears application which seems to work fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly can&#x27;t say that I think this helps all that much.  She still has her good days and her bad days. However, she likes it and even if there&#x27;s simply a minor placebo effect in her mind, it&#x27;s something.  She is doing better in school this year since we started it.  She still struggles.  This is not a life saver or item that makes a dramatic difference, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt either.  She&#x27;s also a chewer and we&#x27;ve found chewlry very helpful this year.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 6 year old daughter with Down Syndrome who we also believe has ADD/ADHD back around July 21, 2014. She is extremely high energy and has a very, very short attention span. She tends to throw things and sometime hit people. I used this every night on the bottom of her feet. I ran out of it about a week or so ago. Therefore the bottle lasted me approximately four months. Because I put it on her at bed time and the scent is very strong (thought it dissipates quickly I feel), and because it is a roll on, I didn&#x27;t realize at first I had run out of it. Since I ran out of it, the throwing and hitting has increased. It never fully went away mind you, but it definitely decreased. I noticed enough of a difference in her once I ran out, that I have just ordered a second bottle. I do believe that there is validity to this product or else I would not have ordered it a second time. It will be interesting to see how her behavior changes after I start putting it on her again. I personally recommend giving this product a try to see if it helps.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in hopes that it would help my son focus and be more calm at school. IT WORKS! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> I have tried this on my five year old son. I cannot notice a difference in his attention. The smell is strong and lasts. The individual oils are not listed on the bottle, and I wish they were. I would recommend Edens Garden&#x27;s Align synergy or Plant Therapys kid safe line.</li>
    <li> No need for meds.  This stuff is fabulous &amp; everyone in the house uses it, from my 5 year old up.</li>
    <li> Love how this oil helps my boy to focus. We can definitely tell if we forget to put it on. The sellers have been great to deal with as well!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product.  Use it on the daily. Rub it in my palm or dab some on the back of my neck.  I&#x27;ve never been diagnosed with ADD but I feel like sometimes I can have a slight case of it.  I can become scatter brain at times and very stressed out especially at my workplace and this really helps keep me calm and focused. The sweet and spicy scent is nice. My yoga instructor introduced me this essential oil and I&#x27;m so glad! Excellent customer service and lightning fast shipping, too!</li>
    <li> Got the oil but there wasn&#x27;t a downloadable Emotional Freedom Technique script like the description lists.</li>
    <li> Great oIl , I use it on my son who has ADHD , works great !</li>
    <li> The Focus Essential oil Blend smells great I enjoy rolling it on in-between work sessions as a nice aroma therapy break. I am not too sure how much it actually helps me to focus and I will be buying more as I do enjoy the product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice anything at all for me or my son . I was hoping to use this for studying and long trips .</li>
    <li> We were hoping this might help our very energetic son.  Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything.  The smell is strong - it&#x27;s not a bad smell, just very strong.</li>
    <li> I feel that it does help to focus, but not as much as I was expecting. It does help though so I do recommend it. It smells nice too.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have ADD, but I do have &amp;#34;menopause madness&amp;#34; as I like to call it. I easily forget details and feel distracted, but this really seems to help. I don&#x27;t know enough about aromatherapy, but a friend of mine does have ADD and swears by this. Either way you will get compliments on the soft fragrance.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> My daughter has ADHD and I think it does help.</li>
    <li> I Love this.  It smells wonderful and helps me to focus when I need it.</li>
    <li> I use this oil every day on myself and my son and it helps.</li>
    <li> love this, very good product.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, did not make much of a difference in my child.</li>
    <li> I Love this oil! It smells wonderful, and has become a partner for my ADD meds. I also have been putting a tiny bit on my son who is high functioning autistic, and his teacher has noticed an improvement in the quality of his school work.  What an amazing help that is non-chemical and is totally affordable!</li>
    <li> Great product without a big price. Came in earlier</li>
    <li> Was very hesitant to order stuff like this but it has had such a calming effect on my son.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my child but every individual is different so you just have to keep trying until you find what is right for your situation. Smell isn&#x27;t that bad either.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks. I notice a change in my 3, 4 and 7 year old when I use it on them!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells wonderful... and if it smells good it&#x27;s more likely to be worn for the purpose it serves. :)</li>
    <li> Smells great. Love it.</li>
    <li> I am a teacher who has had several of my student&#x27;s parents tell me they were using this (and or other products like it) in lieu of real medicine. This doesn&#x27;t work and only offers a placebo. There is no real science to this! Just a bunch of gullible people falling for snake oil.</li>
    <li> seems to help a little bit. I wouldn&#x27;t swear by it.</li>
    <li> Have an alphabet soup son...:) ADHD, Autistic, CP and have purchased the focus to try and I must say I have had good reports from his school that the disruptive behaviors he had been having, had noticably decreased.  For him it has worked.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 10 year old ADHD&#x27;er but he hates the smell which I must admit is potent. He won&#x27;t wear it to school!</li>
    <li> I have a son who is mildly ADHD. We are not the &amp;#34;medicate my child for everything&amp;#34; type of parents so this seemed like a good natural alternative. We will continue to use this aromatherapy method until evidence of failure dictates that we switch methods.</li>
    <li> I thought my child could use this at school to help him focus.  But the smell is so odd and overpowering, it garnered more attention than he wanted.</li>
    <li> Smells great (herby) and helps with focus.  My son and I both apply on our way out the door in the morning.</li>
    <li> I got this for my 4 year old son that could run circles around the energizer bunny.  If his mind and body aren&#x27;t kept busy and challenged, he goes stir crazy.  He was having a difficult time in aftercare because of just that problem.  I was literally in tears because I didn&#x27;t know what else to do.  So...I started to search for natural remedies to help him out and I came across this essential oil blend.  I went on www.nih.gov as well as researched many scholarly articles regarding the clinical trials done on various essential oils and their efficacy.  Every claim listed by Bio Source Naturals is actually true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it out on my son yesterday, which was a great way for me to see exactly how well it did or didn&#x27;t work because he stayed at home with me.  I was amazed and shocked at how good this worked to help him focus and tapper down that abundant energy of his.  This morning, as I sent him to school, I applied some more and hoped for the best.  When I picked him up, two of the teachers commented at how good he was today.  He truly had a remarkable day, which hasn&#x27;t happened since he started school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical buying this because I swore there was nothing in the world that could tame the fire within my little man.  Needless to say, after verifying the claims listed on here with some research, I gave it a try.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.  Definitely plan on buying this again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Bio Source Naturals!</li>
    <li> I received my order and started using it. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I like the individual oils but not the combination though I like the roll-on idea.</li>
    <li> My daughter is in 4th grade. I had wondered since 1st grade if she had some form of ADD. I had conferences with teachers, asked questions, brought up my concerns. I was told nothing is wrong, she is fine.. She performed at or above grade level and made A/B honor roll every marking period. She stopped making honor roll In 3rd grade. She had a less than wonderful teacher. I asked about my concerns (inability to stay focused and on task, easily distracted, taking a long time to complete homework) and again I was told she is fine, smart, nothing to worry about. Well then the notices of possibly being held back started to come home. My child is not an F student nor has she ever brought home an F on a report card. These notices started in 3rd grade and pertain to her less than grade level performance in math. I was shocked. Fast forward to now, 4th grade. I brought up my concerns to her teachers. They were wonderful to deal with. After watching my daughter and seeing how she is in school, one of them mentioned possible ADD characteristics. I started doing more research and it all made sense. I didn&#x27;t feel in my daughter&#x27;s situation that seeing a dr and going on medication would be the best thing for her. I did some research and decided that trying essential oils, dietary changes and adding an Omega-3 supplement would be the best place to start. I purchased the Bio Source Naturals Focus blend. It has made the biggest difference of everything I&#x27;ve done. My daughter is now back on the honor roll, is completing assignments and class work in a timely manner. She is no longer the last one finishing a test or missing recess to finish her work. In fact, on the rare occasion that I forget to apply her oils before school, I&#x27;m guaranteed an email from school asking if everything is ok. Yes, this particular product made that much of a difference. I only wish I had known about it sooner. I  bought this back in December and we started using it right after Christmas Break. I didn&#x27;t write my review right away. I wanted to have some time to make sure this worked for us before I gave my experience.e my review right away.
