      <li>but I used GPS and for the first time did it all by myself!</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
      <li>THis item is WORTH</li>
      <li>I workout every day, and I find that the tracks adhere to the GPS better than to my natural scalp or a stocking cap when sweating.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product does exctly what it says . You must use a generous amount so I strongly suggest no trying to save some. I use this bottle in 2.5 uses meaning i get 2 uses out of each bottle basically but its does its job so its wortth it.  So its needs to stay affordable because we have to use so much to make sure this protection serum doesnt break down while wearing your various styles.</li>
    <li> I see that everytime I do my quickweaves, I am looking for my gro protect!  Its not a bad product.  My hair has been natural for two years and I have been wearing quickweaves for as long as i can remember. I have been using grow protect for year now and I will say that my hair is the length of the weave that I use in my hair...just unrelaxed. I am not sure if its the gro protect because I have been maintaining my hair and growth has not been a problem for me since I have been natural..  I just need to make sure that I use more of the product because sometimes it will capture my edges! That wont stop me from buying, thats my mistake! So Im off to purchase more!</li>
    <li> Well first off, the directions say you can braid or Gel your hair down, with me liking gel much i decided to braid it(longer route I know, but I really wanted to try this product) I applied the product throughout my scalp and braids, especially the parts I knew I would by applying glue. Maybe I would have been satisfied with this if I had gelled my hair down. My scalp hurt after a few days, I think it was because of how hard the product gets. When I washed it out, it came out quickly, but when I took my braids out, there was glue all in my hair! that made me sad, also my edges were thinned out which is bad for me because i already have a big forehead :( I dont think I will use this product again, at least until my edges grow back. I will use gel the next time though</li>
    <li> This product protects your hair from bonding glue and washes out in a breeze. A must have!!</li>
    <li> This is a good concept, however I&#x27;m regularly attend the gym and as a consequence am often sweaty! Everytime I would sweat I would have to re glue certain areas of my hair and once I was at a club and my hair extensions started to come out completely!!! It may have been me and my not applying the product properly so I wouldn&#x27;t write it off completely as there have been so many people who have had a positive experience with this product - I say give it a try and see how it is for you!</li>
    <li> Best stuff when it comes to quick weaves saves so much time with glue removal  perfect</li>
    <li> Ordering the product was a breeze. Thought it would take a couple of weeks to receive the  product but I received it in just a few days.  Now thats good service THANKS!!!  Loving the product it&#x27;s great.[[ASIN:B003BKYYVW Morning Glory Gro-protect Solution 8oz (Blackberry)]]</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 to 3 months now, and I can tell you the pros and cons of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will give your hair time to relax and grow.I like that and have notice a difference in hair length!&lt;br /&gt;This product is a life saver for women on the go, who have children, but still want to look FIERCE!:)&lt;br /&gt;The product comes right off in the shower or sink.  Now they do stand behind that, and I like a product that means what it says ans says what it means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only have one con about this product.  Ladies, Ladies, Ladies there is no such thing as a \\&quot;little bit\\&quot; with this product.  You have to truly saturate your hair or stocking cap with this product!  The last time I put in my quick weave, I notice that I was running low on the product and I guess I didn&#x27;t put enough on the stocking cap. When I went to wash my weave out, I notice that the glue had caught a little bit of my hair. I had to use oil to get it out. My advice to not cut corners with this product. Your investment is your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smooches</li>
    <li> i have never put tracks in my hair with glue. i tried this and it is amazing. it does exactly what it says. i did notice some bumps around the sides of my head, dont know if that is from the product or not. if only there is a remedy to stop my head from itching. the hair will not be reuseable.</li>
    <li> Product protects hair from glue, as stated.  I would recommend any day over stocking caps!</li>
    <li> THIS IS A REALLY GOOD PRODUCT IT DID WHAT IT SAID IT WOULD DO WHICH WAS PROTECT MY HAIR FROM BONDING GLUE. WHEN I TOOK MY WEAVE OUT THERE WAS NO GLUE ON MY HAIR BUT THE CONS WERE THAT I PULLED MY HAIR BACK IN A PONY TAIL AND APPLIED THIS PRODUCT TO MY HAIR AND EDGES. IT PULLED MY EDGES OUT A LITTLE BIT AND ALSO CAUSED LITTLE RED BUT BUMPS ON MY EDGES. BUT IM DOING MY HAIR A 2ND TIME USING THIS PRODUCT AND IT BEST NOT TO PUT ON YOUR EDGES AND WRAP THE HAIR INSTEAD OF PUTTING IN A PONY TAIL. THIS TIME I APPLIED THE PRODUCT TO A STOCKING CAP INSTEAD OF PUTTING IT DIRECTLY ON MY HAIR AND IT WORKED JUST THE SAME AND I DONT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MY EDGES COMING OUT. OTHER THAN THAT ITS A GREAT PRODUCT WHICH WILL HELP MY HAIR GROW BACK TO A DECENT LENGHT.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! I&#x27;ve ALWAYS been afraid to use a bonding application for weaves but I decided to try this product after seeing it in action. It is AMAZING! I usually have someone else install my weaves for me but I used GPS and for the first time did it all by myself! It came out GREAT! Everyone who saw me thought I&#x27;d finally cut my hair short &amp; sassy but I hadn&#x27;t! I used GPS, Salon Pro 30 Second Bonding Glue and a cheap 27 pieces hair pack and I had the most amazing short hairstyle ever! I saved myself $200 doing it myself! Not only that but when it was time to take it down it washed right out! The texture of my hair is even BETTER than before! No one believed that I hadn&#x27;t cut my hair until they saw me with hair down my back the next month.  It was my 2nd weave install with GPS! And it held up beautifully even with the weight of the longer hair.  Now I tell everyone about this product. It makes changing my hairstyles as easy as 1-2-3!! I don&#x27;t worry about damage to my own hair  and it helps improve the texture &amp; health of my own hair too!!  By the way I found it on Amazon for the lowest price! If your local beauty supply store isn&#x27;t in contract with a manufaturing and/or supplier you won&#x27;t get certain products.  I can&#x27;t get this product anywhere in my entire state!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  My hair was breaking in the top from glue and this product eliminates that because the glue never touches your head.  It does seem, however to take more that 2 to 3 minutes to rinse from the hair.  I think the problem was that I used warm water as instructed and that was not warm enough to disosolve the product. Once I started to make water hotter it worked better.  I will certainly try this product again.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Did my first quick weave a few months past, this was perfect.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and it stands up to everything that it says. Great price and it works, what else can you ask for.</li>
    <li> This product is a MUST HAVE when using glue in the hair i.e. a \\&quot;quick weave\\&quot;. The product does help to nourish the hair while it&#x27;s molded down. It easily washes out w/ warm water when you&#x27;re ready to take it off. And best of all it causes no damage to the hair nor any glue to penetrate to the hair shaft. Excellent buy! A++++++</li>
    <li> Love this product especially for edge protection! Smells great to</li>
    <li> After watching vids and testimonials on Youtube for this product, I finally decided to try it myself. I will NEVER install another quick weave without it! It is a great alternative to using a stocking cap, and it easily washes out with warm water.  This product delivers every time.  Amazon has the best price I&#x27;ve seen, (the 8oz bottle in my local BSS is $29.99) and it&#x27;s soooooo easy to use.  The very 1st time I used it, (hair in a wrap instead of ponytail) I did find that there was glue on my edges because I hadn&#x27;t used enough.  The average head will need about 2 ounces of product. I workout every day, and I find that the tracks adhere to the GPS better than to my natural scalp or a stocking cap when sweating.  If you&#x27;re trying to decide whether or not to buy, please BUY this!! You will be so glad you did!!</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this product. I bought two because of the rave reviews everyone else was giving it. The sides of my hair broke off alot. I&#x27;m re-selling the one I didn&#x27;t use. I&#x27;m going back to braids. It&#x27;s almost as if my hair soaked the product up, I got ready to wash my hair it it was like I didn&#x27;t put anything into it at all. I don&#x27;t know if i should have put more solution in my hair or what. According to morning glory, the makers of gro protect solutions, this stuff is supposed to replace stocking caps and is supposed to be all you need to protect your hair from glue. However, i read other reviews of people who after using gro protect solution and losing their sides or edges, they are back to using a stocking cap in addition to the gro protect solutions. So this product aint doing what its supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Used it as a water-soluble glue to hold wigs on my head.</li>
    <li> This product was good. It was my first time using it. I was very generous in the amount i used over my real hair but after glueing in my weave and taking it out about 3 weeks later, the tracks came off fine and easy but when i washed my head to get the protect solution out, I noticed some of the glue had gotten on my hair and some of my hair came off. So I won&#x27;t give it 5 stars but it pretty much works. Not sure maybe i&#x27;m not doing something right? Next time i will put EVEN MORE to insure that the glue is only touching the solution and not my hair.</li>
    <li> I really do not need to say anything about this product because I love everything that I order. Thank You</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best invention yet...I use it on all my quick weaves if used properly the weave will wash out easily and no glue will be left in your hair</li>
    <li> I was not impress, waste of money to me,</li>
    <li> I got this product  couple years ago it really works I rarely do quick weaves on myself but when I do I use this product it is best to get it especially if you do a lot of quick weaves it really protectes your edges from being pulled out from the glue and rinses out when your ready to take your weave out. Would buy again</li>
    <li> It really worked and I have long hair. Easy removal !!! Great a must have item that leaves hair nice and soft.</li>
    <li> This is my go to for quick weaves. Other brands do not work as well at protection for my hair nor do they rinse off as easily. I won&#x27;t use any other brand and this bottle costs double in beauty supply stores.</li>
    <li> I recently went to the hair salon to get a quick weave. The stylist suggested this product and for the first time in my life i tried it. Bumps formed around my head the next day, and after 3 wks i couldn&#x27;t take the itching sensation so i washed it out. 2 wks later my scalp is badly irritated. I can barely touch it or restyle it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product it grows the hair</li>
    <li> The big question is, \\&quot;Is this product really glue free and can it does it really stand by its name\\&quot;?  Well I tried this product for the first time and yes I was as skeptical as you are.  It also took me a while on contemplating buying this product before making the decision.  I must say that this product protected glue from getting in my hair for the \\&quot;most\\&quot; part.  However its not truly 100%.  It took more than the suggested washing time for the tracks to be removed and that included trying warm and/or cold water.  Secondly, glue still got onto my hair.  Especially around my edges where I made sure that extra Morning Glory Gro-protect Solution was applied.  So needless to say my hair thinned out due to the glue getting in my hair.  I have pictures as well.  If you must try this product I would use extra protection by applying the Morning Glory Gro-protect Solution, a shower cap, and a stocking cap before applying any glue.  Yes all of these stepes to prevent any glue from getting on your hair or just dont use it at all.  I know that sounds like a lot but to me its worth not getting the glue on my hair and protecting my hair.</li>
    <li> Love it...works great!! But Remember to saturate!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Made my hair very stiff and break off. Not for me</li>
    <li> I tried this product out after reading reviews. I first molded and dried my hair prior to using the product. Once my mold was dry, I applied a layer of GPS onto my molded hair and sat under the dryer for another 12-15 minutes and proceeded with styling my hair. Upon taking it out, I rinsed it for about 3 minutes and it slid right out! No glue in my hair at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I did my hair, I tried to do a new style. Following the same process, I did my hair again. However, I didn&#x27;t like my hair so I decided to take it out right after doing it. So I immediately rinsed my hair out, and voila, it slid right out again! Granted it took about 5-8 minutes this time because the bond was still fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this product. For the people that are having problems with glue still being in their hair or their hair being matted upon rinsing out, I would advise using a second layer of GPS and be sure you are hitting every area on your head. As I stated before, I only had to use one layer and a very thin one at that. I mold my hair down in a low pony and pin the bun up under, so when I rinse my hair out, I do it in the shower rinsing with my head back in the direction of the application. If you rinse your hair the opposite way, it will get slightly tangled/matted This happened the first time I did my hair, but the tangles easily came out upon shampooing - I didn&#x27;t attempt to comb my hair right after rinsing out the solution instead I shampooed and conditioned first before attempting to comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> THe key is to follow the instructions.  Make sure your hair is fully dry before you add this item.  I will tell you my mistakes and my good tips.  First off, really make sure your hair is dry before you add this item and before you add your tracks. Second, I did it in a 2 day process if you have to do it in one day, start early in the morning so you are not rushed.&lt;br /&gt;This is not an project to start at 3:00 pm if you plan to go out at 6:00 pm.  Three, I added a second layer of the gro protect in areas where I had concerns about losing hair like my back areas.  My mistakes were -  I think I used too much glue when I was  bonding my tracks.  When I washed the tracks out you need the water to be as warm/hot as you can stand it. If the water is not warm it will not loosen the glue.  The hair does fall out but I had to wash it like 10 minutes at a minimum.  Also the hair does not just FALL out, you have to kind of nudge it out but some areas it did just fall out in the sink.  But mind you, I used so much glue I think that played a role in it taking so long to wash out.  ALso, I still had a little glue balls left in my hair.  SO I used Pro Salon glue removing shampoo and I put on a plastic cap, lathered my hair and let is \\&quot;soak\\&quot; in for like 1/2 hour.  THen I washed it with the shampoo and I used a wide tooth comb and got the remaining glue out.  But the hair I lost was not 1/3 of what I would have lost had I not used this gro protect.  THis item is WORTH it cause I lost very very very little hair.  I Lost the amount of hair I would have lost in daily brushing and combing of my hair.  I will continue to use this item.  It is easier and worth the money.  Next time, I&#x27;m going to try and use as little glue as possible and see if my results are better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - I have discovered another use of the solution.  For those who wear half wigs and can&#x27;t braid their hair or don&#x27;t have enough to braid, I gelled my hair back, let it dry and added the grow prot. solution and my hair remained nice and hard unitil I washed it out.  I wear my hair back with a headband 1 inch from my edges, you I gel my front straight back, put hair pins to seperate where I do not want to put the GPS,then apply and it really allows you to leave you hair alone even while you are wearing a half wig or full wig.  SO this product is good for weaves and wigs.ned nice and hard unitil I washed it out.

    <li> I used this product before but paid much more at local beauty supply.It really protects natural hair without hair loss</li>
    <li> When you are going to do a quick weave, I suggest using this. It is a bit expensive, but it will keep your hair protected.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product 4 about 3yrs now,and i find morning glory protect solution to be the best in it&#x27;s category, i have used  other products that claim to do the exact same thing and cheaper in price, but for me personally, my hair is left in  better condition using the morning glory solution.note; if you have weak or thin edges ,make sure you use a bee-hive method or leave your edges out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because I needed something that would protect my natural hair when doing quick weaves. The good thing about this product is it smells nice. When I used it the first time, it kept lifting. At that point I only had it in for two of three days and I don&#x27;t work out heavy; also, it wasn&#x27;t hot outside. I later found bumps around my nape leading up to my ear. I don&#x27;t know if it was an allergic reaction or what. When I went to remove the product, it rinsed out, but it took nearly 35 minutes. I used a lot if the product to ensure full coverage, but it didn&#x27;t hold up to the golden standards I saw in the reviews.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! I would just like to say that the Morning Glory Grow Protect Solution was excellent! It does everything the discription says. It protected my hair from the bonding glue I applied and works in conditioning your hair. I would recommend this product to anyone using bonding glue in their hair!</li>
    <li> The morning Glory hair solution were purchased to protect the hair and it carried out the job and prevented hair breakage. Everyone who utilize hair glue  will find this product amazing.</li>
    <li> So, I started sweating and my hair started to rise.....no problem because once it dries its secure again. Well after it dried I started seeing flakes of this stuff falling out of my weave (Like dandruff) and my scalp was on fire! It started to crystalize on my scalp and once I washed it off my scalp was oozing and runny. Once the oozing stopped I started to lose my hair..... Horrible, horrible, horrible experience! But other people seem to do fine with it. (go figure)</li>
    <li> Excellent one more time, It really cover and protect my hair by making get it darkness everytime more. Good I&#x27;ll buy it again next time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s  better  than other products  i been using.But i workout 6 days a week  it says SWEAT PROOF but its not that&#x27;s  wgy i purchased  the product.but its definitely  not SWEAT PROOF!!!</li>
    <li> This Product is not all it claims to be. The weave came off my hair just as promised. I rinsed it for a couple of minutes in warm water and the weave came off very Smooth. That I will say, but I have used it twice. Once for a week, and another for 2 weeks. I gave it a second chance just in case I did not use it correctly the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the product as instructed and I got the same result ... After removing My weave: glue was on my hair (Only in certain Areas) and Large, Long chunks of my hair coming out once I started to RINSE my Hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read some responses to others who have had the same result and the same thing happen. they all say the same thing, its a Matting and tangling problem. If that was the case then rinsing my hair would not have caused my hair to start falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Opinion is that this Product failed at its mission!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR FUTURE USERS: IF you are going to use this product USE Additional measures to protect your hair as this product only makes removing your Weave more convenient.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it for me. It does everything it says that it will but my hair didn&#x27;t respond well to it. My scalp was irritated my hair got too dry. but don&#x27;t let me discourage you. My friend&#x27;s hair is still healthy and she loves it. It works!!</li>
    <li> Hair loss. The bottle was secured by tape. I was hesitant, but still used it. Will not order online again. Mu hair loss was depressing, wore weaves until I got it to grow back.</li>
    <li> This product is great!!!!! I use this on all of my client&#x27;s. There is nothing negative about this product. I just have this to say, for the negative comments about this product, if you do not follow the instructions, then this product won&#x27;t work. This product is meant only for licensed cosmetologists. Ijs!!</li>
    <li> GREAT HAIR PROTECTANT!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  The scent is pleasant and it does exactly what the demo says it will. It&#x27;s not irritating to the skin, either.</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect for quick weaves!!</li>
    <li> I used it according to the directions and all the YouTube rave. I simply rinsed it out with a war a s I could handle. Just a little manipulation and it came right out. I also noticed the texture of my hair, and dry scalp was not as bad. Will continues o use it. It&#x27;s worth the investment. My hair is 95% natural now with clipping my ends. So I have to blow dry and warm comb it to get a even distribution into my thick curly hair. No complaints.</li>
    <li> my wife bought this after seeing in on youtube, an she is loving it, she said it does the job well</li>
    <li> I rave about this product. I used it in my moms hair first did a quick weave and when i rinsed it out it came off like a wig no glue was on her hair and her hair felt good. After using on hers I did a quick weave on myself and absolutely loved it. This is no my favorite hair care product I love the way it protects my hair. I didn&#x27;t think that it would work as good on my head because my hair is thick but it worked awesome. I would recommend this to everyone I know and have already told a few friend that do hair about it.</li>
    <li> I choose this product because I use other product similar to morning glory solution and they did not work as well.&lt;br /&gt;MY Likes about Morning Glory Solution was that it was every thing they said it was on the review.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product first unless you can not pruchase it or it is out of stock,  than I would say use something else if you cannot wait.</li>
    <li> i love the product it does just what they said it does. I will be ordering some more as soon as I need it.Morning Glory your the best!!</li>
    <li> I really liked it and I last for a long time and it came out really easy so good product</li>
    <li> I recommend, Very NICE</li>
    <li> Maybe they need to change the usage label and put more clear and concise instructions on how to use this but it didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I am just tired of putting chemicals and products like these in my hair because of not being completely satisfied with the hair God gave me. No more perms or weaves or anything- just my natural kinky hair from now on. I trusted this product when I gave glue a second chance and it didn&#x27;t work at all, I had glue stuck in my hair and the weave was difficult to remove even after standing in the shower for 20 mins.</li>
