      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I have been using la Roche for many years, never disappointed!</li>

      <li>it blends easy..</li>
      <li>/&gt;It rubs in easily too.</li>
      <li>Worth the cost because it is effective and comfortable.</li>
      <li>Nice on the face, not thick like so many sunscreens</li>

      <li>My face has never been this light by August.</li>
      <li>Leaves a smooth even finish on my skin as if I were wearing foundation.  </li>
      <li>So I put a light coat of powder over it and that makes it better.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product has never caused breakouts, and my makeup looks great over it giving me a lasting, dewey finish.</li>

      <li>I do not have fair skin, but I do have tan skin that easily bronzes ten minutes in the sun without protection, which I do not like.  </li>
      <li>It has no smell, sinks in and provides great coverage.</li>

      <li>For someone with less sensitive skin, it would be an excellent choice.</li>
      <li>It was very inexpensive over there and widely available.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the price.</li>
      <li>Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, but I think it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, overall it is a high quality and pleasant sunscreen.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product... I have used for 5+ years on face, neck, chest area.</li>
    <li> I have PLME (polymorphic light eruption&#x3D; allergic to sunshine) and live in the South. This stuff is amazing. As far as protection, other sunscreens pale in comparison (no pun intended). I can comfortably have sun exposure for at least 2 hours without breaking out.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years.  Recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I have an extreme sun allergy, and this allows me to be outdoors without worry of breakouts which can be miserable. I still have to be careful about time exposure, but this really lengthens the time for day-long outings with reapplication as directions say. I couldn&#x27;t do this with Coppertone Sport, which was my favorite. I can live a normal life again.&lt;br /&gt;It rubs in easily too.</li>
    <li> The best sunscreen for the money, highly rated!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing! Like a BB cream and high SPF sunblock.</li>
    <li> Feels good, goes on nice and smells nice.  I bought it after I saw a segment on the Today show that rated it #1.  It was expensive, but since I put it on my 2-year old granddaughter, I was willing to shell out the extra $$$.  You get what you pay for, and I feel much better knowing that she has top products slathered all over her sweet little frame.</li>
    <li> Living in South Florida, the sun is brutal.  My dermatologist recommended this sunscreen a couple years ago; and I have been using it ever since.  This is the best sunscreen that I have ever used!</li>
    <li> i use this all the every day under makeup.  was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ved used it for years and find it to be an excellent product.</li>
    <li> Really works. Love it.</li>
    <li> This sun screen works excellent.  Makes your skin look great, not greasy like other brands.  For me it completely blocks the sun&#x27;s rays.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Found this product not greasy,felt good on my skin, and an very easy to apply. And it works!</li>
    <li> my dermatologist recommended it. It has no odor and works well</li>
    <li> Great, great, great sunscreen. Leave my skin moist and above all protects! Does not go on white.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen in the market, as far as I am concerned. I have  been using La Roche for the past 15 years. My only gripe is how expensive it is.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyes</li>
    <li> this works so well. recommended by my skin doctor and I love it</li>
    <li> Goes on easy, leaves no film or residue and is very effective!</li>
    <li> Though pricy, this is an excellent sunscreen.  It was recommended by my dermatologist, who, like everyone else in the medical and skin care business warns strongly against over exposure to sun.  My wife and I used this on a week- long trip to St. John over Easter. No days lost to sun burn.  One note, you should re-apply after getting out of the water.</li>
    <li> By far a great product!  Went on a 7 day beach vacation and used it on the whole family and no one had sun burn.  Very glad I spent the money for this!</li>
    <li> I wear sunscreen all year long, as one should.  I do not have fair skin, but I do have tan skin that easily bronzes ten minutes in the sun without protection, which I do not like.  Anyway, I saw this product when I visited Paris, looking for a sunscreen to wear as I did the tourist thing in late August. I was familiar with the brand, but La Roche-Posay was not yet widely available in the US then.  This is THE BEST SUNSCREEN out there.  It is so smooth, not at all sticky which is a big deal for my husband who I usually have to wrestle to wear sunscreen.  He is a sunburn magnet, and this worked great for him.  I felt awesome on and still let your skin breathe without feeling cakey all over. I didn&#x27;t find any evidence of white powdery coating either that other sunscreens leave on my skin (which is so visible on me).  Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, but I think it&#x27;s worth every penny.  I wish Amazon sold the continuous spray version though.</li>
    <li> This is about the best sunscreen that you can purchase according to my dermatologist.  The product was as advertised and was delivered on time.  I would purchase this again from this vendor!</li>
    <li> I purchased this sunscreen at the recommendation of my dermatologist. I have gone back to using Cetaphil lotion for everyday use, however, as this sunscreen lotion is a little harsh on my sensitive skin. I have a tendency to eczema, and this sunscreen made my skin a little tender, especially around the corners of my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not very appealing either. It&#x27;s very faint, however, so not overpowering. It smells like...well sunscreen. I have never really liked that smell. It&#x27;s not gross or anything. Just kind of meh...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, overall it is a high quality and pleasant sunscreen. I give it four stars. For someone with less sensitive skin, it would be an excellent choice.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day.  It was recommended by my dermatologist.  I would definitely order this product again.  Non greasy with lots of moisture.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen based on the great reviews. However, I am VERY disappointed of  Anthelios. It is supposed to be for the face and body. Well, your face will be and feel really dry 2 hours after the first application, on top of that, the sunscreen will leave your face HORRIBLY WHITE, like a Halloween ghost. I have always bought sunscreen from Lancome, but the prices are too expensive  so I decided to try Anthelios. I did want it to work because it is more affordable and the reviews said it was so great. The reality is that it dries the skin even if you apply before the sunscreen a good moisturizer and you will look like Snow white,  I&#x27;m using it only to go running in the mornings but even after being out for at least one hour, the whiteness remains in your face. Bad product, will never buy it again.</li>
    <li> I really like this sunscreen.  It is pricey but I like that Consumer Reports listed it as the best sunscreen.  I have not broken out and it is not excessively greasy feeling.  It dries and makeup goes on fine afterwards.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen out there. It has no smell, sinks in and provides great coverage. It&#x27;s expensive to use as a broad family product but we all grab for it.</li>
    <li> I am very fair...and it worked as advertised..and I spend a lot of time outdoors.....</li>
    <li> Nice on the face, not thick like so many sunscreens</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen. Works well.</li>
    <li> When I received this item it was already expired.</li>
    <li> While the sun protection of this product seems to work well for the two times I&#x27;ve used it, my skin was like sand paper after each use.  This really dried out my skin to the extent that I just can&#x27;t use it.  I thought the milky texture of this would be moisturizing, but quite the opposite.</li>
    <li> great sunscreen ---goes on smoothly and not sticky</li>
    <li> Works into skin with minimum rubbing and leaves no white film.  Worth the cost because it is effective and comfortable.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to, use every day brand of sunscreen.  The 60 (or 50) cream is what I use.  I prefer it to the milk.  Did not care for the consistency of the milk formula and it just seemed runny to me.&lt;br /&gt;The 60 provides full coverage from the sun... especially important to using RetinA.  This product has never caused breakouts, and my makeup looks great over it giving me a lasting, dewey finish.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen more expensive at this spot by about 2X. I bought another tube at another cheaper site and found that for both of the new tubes the formula is much thicker than usual, and I&#x27;ve been buying this sunscreen for years. The new formula doesn&#x27;t melt in and stays white for awhile. The white haze isn&#x27;t as bad as most other physical sunscreens, but it is annoying that the older product didn&#x27;t leave any whitish haze.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen gives excellent coverage at 60 spf, but is not sticky. It&#x27;s more like a lotion than a sunscreen. I love it.</li>
    <li> it blends easy.. does not clog.. feels and absorbs well and keeps you from sunburn. being a tour guide i highly recommend it.. goes well under makeup too and it does last me all day...</li>
    <li> I hate sunscreen.  We have tried dozens and dozens of sunscreens over the years.  This one is simply the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- does not feel greasy&lt;br /&gt;- does not make you look like a painted ghost&lt;br /&gt;- &#x27;Melt in&#x27; is a great descriptor&lt;br /&gt;- you forget you have sunscreen on - amazing accomplishment for someone who absolutely hates sunscreen but absolutely NEEDS sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;- You should try this in spite of the costs&lt;br /&gt;- used it in the Caribbean snorkeling for hours &amp; worked amazingly well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Cost</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s gentle, fully absorbs, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue and works well on my sensitive skin.  (I can&#x27;t use many sunscreens because they cause my skin to react.)  It&#x27;s definitely a keeper.</li>
    <li> Fantastic sunscreen! Barely and smell and easy to apply. I wore this to the beach on my face (in Florida in June) and after swimming for several hours I came in with no sunburn. I should note I&#x27;m very fair skinned. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Contains oxybenzone octocylene naturally after I bought it dermatologist tells me this stuff makes my brown spots darker .got zinc oxide spf  spots are lighter also stopped using the lightening cream they sold me . That really made my spots darker.</li>
    <li> Works well, protects and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Melts in as it says without the greasy film.  Seems to work well.  My face has never been this light by August.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a light, scent-free sunscreen for daily wear. I wear the corresponding La Roche-Posay Anthelios 60 sunscreen on my face and neck; however that comes in a very small bottle so I wanted something else for my body. This has a slightly different texture than the face version--the face version is more matte and this leaves a bit of a sheen; however it dries quickly on my arms and feels more like lotion than a thick sunscreen. It provides great protection and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling or smelling gross.</li>
    <li> best there is in stopping both types of ultraviolet sun damaging rays.</li>
    <li> I use this sunscreen on my face every morning during the summer months and like it very much. It doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin break out and protects me from the sun all day long. I switch to another formulation with a lower SPF int fall/winter months.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen rocks! Does a great job even on little cheeks that are in the pool for long periods of time.  :)</li>
    <li> my dermatologist recommended it</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading a review on someone&#x27;s blog.  They said it went on light and was fragrance-free.  It did go on light, but it still leaves an oily feeling and there is a smell typical of sunscreens.  I was recently in Japan and found a terrific sunscreen product.  It was very inexpensive over there and widely available.  The brand is BIORE, and the product is Aqua Watery Essence, SPF 50.  It is the most wonderful smooth, light, non-smelly sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.  Once you put it on, you don&#x27;t even realize something&#x27;s on your skin.  It never makes your eyes water, either.  Next time I go to Japan, I&#x27;ll stock up.  Everything in Japan is made well, in fact.  Why not here in USA?</li>
    <li> Not only provides exceptional protection from the sun, but seems to soften and moisturize skin.</li>
    <li> The description &amp;#34;melts in&amp;#34;, along with the positive Consumer Reports review, and a friend&#x27;s recommendation convinced me to give it a try.  I guess you can say it &amp;#34;melts in&amp;#34;, but no differently than the Coppertone Ultra 70 spf that I bought at the same time.  Practically no odor/perfume, it&#x27;s perfect for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work in a high profile dermatology department and this product is specifically recommended by the docs.  It is pricey though, and given my positive experience with Coppertone product mentioned above, I probably won&#x27;t repurchase.  That said, if you wouldn&#x27;t be caught wearing anything less expensive, go for it - it works!</li>
    <li> Leaves a smooth even finish on my skin as if I were wearing foundation.  Have been using it for years after a dermatologist recommended it.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Went on smoothly and easily.  Even the kids didn&#x27;t complain!</li>
    <li> I have been using la Roche for many years, never disappointed!</li>
    <li> Finally found a sunscreen that:&lt;br /&gt;Works (top priority) on my extremely sun/chemical sensitive skin.  So far (3 weeks) no sunburn and no sun rash.  I must add that I am also careful about applying a generous amount on my arms 15 minutes prior to going out and I avoid the hot afternoon sun.  I do not use it on my face since that is well protected and I can get away with SPF30 sunscreen there.&lt;br /&gt;Dries almost instantly, feels very comfortable, non greasy.  Note, you will start to perspire after about 90 minutes.  I usually wash off the sunscreen when I get back from walking the dogs and have finished any minimal morning yard work.  But unlike every other product I&#x27;ve tried, I&#x27;m very comfortable the first hour and a half after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;It has NOT stained my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;Biggest and really the only negative is the high price.  After 3 weeks I&#x27;m almost at the end of my first tube.  It&#x27;s going to be an expensive summer here in the southwest US!</li>
    <li> My skin is very allergic to sunscreens, but has no reaction to this. It isn&#x27;t too oily like vanicream and it goes on light so I forget that I have it on. I use it on my tattoos and it keeps them bright in the southern california sun.</li>
    <li> This is very effective sunscreen. I first read about it in the dermatologist&#x27;s office and have used it ever since. It goes on smoothly and feels like a nice face lotion. I am not a beachgoer but am out riding my horse most mornings and feel protected.</li>
    <li> Excellent product - I have sensitive skin and the product never causes problems.  Most importantly, the product prevents skin damage when I am in the sun.</li>
    <li> Almost no scent, absorbs quickly and transparent. Did not stain my clothes. Very happy with my purchase and will be using daily as my city sunscreen.</li>
    <li> nice all year around, good for skin</li>
    <li> Awesome sunscreen. I went to Bali and did not burn. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this almost everyday for 2 weeks now and I like this product. I have dry skin, but I don&#x27;t need to use a moisturizer under this sunscreen. It also does not leave a white cast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no yellow tint or staining as stated in some other posts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like it makes me look a bit oily even though my skin doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. So I put a light coat of powder over it and that makes it better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No break outs at all. Overall, a very nice sunscreen that can be worn daily. And I did yard work without getting sunburned.</li>
    <li> Excellent product&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer and non greasy</li>
    <li> I have tried various brands and types of sunblock for my daughter and no matter how often I would apply them she would still end up red under her eyes where she has light freckles. Her dermatologist recommended this and it works. No more burnt skin.</li>
    <li> I am very fair-skinned.  Essentially, except for a few freckles I don&#x27;t tan.  This is one of the few sunscreen brands that really protects.  Even after several weeks of visiting the beach daily with my wife, it kept me from suffering any burn at all.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The Sunscreen was not sealed closed and appeared to have been used.</li>
    <li> Dermatologist recommended - works well</li>
    <li> Great product. Not greasy, pleasant smell, applies easily! Best sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried. Also, doesn&#x27;t make my eyes burn. Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it as directed (yes, you must allow 15-20 minutes for it to offer its full protection) for outdoor swimming at the pool and in full sun. Fairly absorbent and non-greasy (by sunblocks&#x27; standards) and no sunburn whatsoever. Fragrance is not offensive either.</li>
    <li> This product work like a charm the best ever</li>
    <li> It feels good on the skin and protects you from sun exposure if you follow the directions, however it is expensive.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist office.  Love it.  Melts into my skin and it is not greasy.  I am fair and have had many pre-cancers removed.  I put this on every morning, rain or shine.  The price is excellent, costs more at the drug store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased sunscreens on all ends of the price spectrum. I&#x27;ve come to the realization that I prefer how higher end sunscreens feel, but I found myself trying to use pricey ones sparingly to save money. Which kind of defeats the intent of buying sunscreen in my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this particular Anthelios sunscreen because I feel like it&#x27;s the best of both worlds. Price won&#x27;t break the bank and yet it has the finish of a more expensive sunscreen. I have dark, olive skin and I love that this sunscreen doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast on my face. It goes on a little greasy at first and then dries to a more velvet finish. I prefer to apply it and wait 20 minutes or so before putting on my liquid foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is sensitive and acne prone - I actually took accutane at one point to clear up my acne. This sunscreen has never broken me out or irritated me. I&#x27;ve used it on my two year old (extremely sensitive skin, eczema problems) in a pinch and it worked well on her as well. I love that I can carry one sunscreen for the whole family.</li>
