### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the best exfoliater for your skin.</li>
      <li>This is perfect &amp; fits the bill.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an excellent scrubber for 2 or so months.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product with enduring quality!</li>
      <li>Otherwise, these cloths are wonderful.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best.</li>
      <li>but this is so flexible and an excellent exfoliator.</li>
      <li>She loved them!</li>
      <li>so this works wonderfully to get the nice glow</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s a great product if your skin needs it.</li>
      <li>Great wash cloth.  </li>
      <li>LOVE THIS WASH CLOTH!!  </li>
      <li>I hope they are able to keep the ayate in stock!</li>
      <li>The wash cloth feels very strong and doesn&#x27;t fall apart at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>exfoliates nicely without hurting, soap foams easily.</li>
      <li>When one wears out, and they do after a year or more, I get another.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE: the earthy smell is totally gone but the washcloth&#x27;s holding up great!</li>
      <li>will be getting more when this runs out (probably</li>
      <li>I love this as a replacement for my plastic loofah and washcloth.  </li>
      <li>this exfoliates without scratching/irritating, rinses clean, and dries well :)</li>
      <li>That was over a year ago, and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
      <li>so i imagine it will hold up just fine</li>
      <li>I have very dry skin and couple this with my absolute favorite bath gel (Korres Guava Shower Gel) and it works GREAT!</li>
      <li>this works great for exfoliating and especially getting rid of ingrown hairs.</li>
      <li>I recently bought my mother one, and after comparing the two I can honestly say the older one is still in great shape.</li>
      <li>Had a similar cloth before and loved it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I would suggest using an all-natural vegetable based soap to feel the full experience.  </li>
      <li>leaves a very clean feeling, peeling for whole body.</li>
      <li>so I quickly ordered another.</li>
      <li>They perform much like a loofah, but are washable, easy to handle and maneuver and work just like a wash cloth.</li>
      <li>I finally got to this one and when I opened the package I was happy to see that it was like my old one.  </li>
      <li>(Totally worth it.)</li>
      <li>This is just the right balance of scrubbing power and gentleness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get it because every other time I have purchased one of these, it shrank up and tightened after the first couple of uses, which made it easier to handle and more able to hold my liquid soap.</li>
      <li>It has become increasingly difficult to find it on the ground, and I am so happy that I was able to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I recently purchased here is ok.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of my favorite personal care items.</li>
      <li>My towels are staying more dead cell free also.</li>
      <li>Ayate is pretty neat in that you can scrub very rigorously without sand papering the skin.  </li>
      <li>I really like using Ayete cloths in the shower.</li>
      <li>But then again, I also paid about 1/2 the price for it, so I can&#x27;t really complain.  </li>
      <li>Very porous.</li>
      <li>This has become my new shower cloth!</li>
      <li>Your skin is left smooth and soft afterwards.  </li>
      <li>It shrinks to about 3/4 the size of a cotton wash cloth once wet, which suits me just fine.</li>
      <li>i sent it through the washer and dryer on a normal cycle and it seems unchanged.</li>
      <li>Would like to get another one for travel, since it is pretty small and can be packed easily.</li>
      <li>one thing that may bother some people, it smells a little earthy at first, but the smell quickly goes away.</li>
      <li>but it leaves the skin very soft and not irritated at all.</li>
      <li>, my skin gets amazingly soft.</li>
      <li>My skin feels soft and glows after every shower.</li>
      <li>, like, next year... haha)</li>
      <li>The old saying goes &#x27;you get what you pay for&#x27;</li>
      <li>I use it with all natural soaps.</li>
      <li>I even use it on my 5year old sometimes and she doesn&#x27;t mind it.</li>
      <li>My skin is so soft and no dead cells.</li>
      <li>No sticky soap residue, soft smooth skin and less overall dryness.</li>
      <li>Pretty rough and scratchy wash cloth</li>
      <li>so next time, I will spend the extra few $$ for a better product.</li>
      <li>I am going to purchase a new one and see how it goes, but this was definitely strange.</li>
      <li>Then the fibers get loose and soft.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I use the ayate cloth every day. My skin is so soft and no dead cells. My towels are staying more dead cell free also.</li>
    <li> I always have one of these in the shower.  When one wears out, and they do after a year or more, I get another.  I&#x27;ve tried other things but this is so flexible and an excellent exfoliator.</li>
    <li> I wanted a cloth like a loofah that would not unravel and I could wash in the washer. This is perfect &amp; fits the bill. I use it with all natural soaps.</li>
    <li> I am comparing this cloth with one I&#x27;ve recently used.  I had previously purchased this type of Avate wash cloth from Athena&#x27;s Products.  It lasted well over a year for me and stretched out when it was wet, shrunk when it was dry.  The Avate wash cloth I recently purchased here is ok.  It shrunk when wet and the ends roll, which sometimes makes it hard to hold onto while washing.  It still feels good in that it feels like it exfoliates as described, but I have to admit I was a bit disappointed.  It was the opposite of the one I was used to, shrinking when wet and curling.  But then again, I also paid about 1/2 the price for it, so I can&#x27;t really complain.  The old saying goes &#x27;you get what you pay for&#x27; so next time, I will spend the extra few $$ for a better product.</li>
    <li> This is the best exfoliater for your skin. My skin feels soft and glows after every shower. I do a lot of spray tanning so this works wonderfully to get the nice glow</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the only one in the household who needs a special-snowflake skin scrubber. Ayate is pretty neat in that you can scrub very rigorously without sand papering the skin.  Loofa is too abrasive for my skin. This is just the right balance of scrubbing power and gentleness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a dollop of sensitive skin apricot scrub + a hard scrubbing with an ayate cloth, my skin gets amazingly soft. The surprise is that it&#x27;s turned out I&#x27;ve had acne for decades for no reason whatsoever. It just...goes away. I&#x27;m shocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is that the cloth doesn&#x27;t last nearly long enough. It&#x27;s an excellent scrubber for 2 or so months. Then the fibers get loose and soft. By month 4, pieces crumble off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely not a washcloth replacement. But it&#x27;s a great product if your skin needs it. Just budget for buying 4-6 per year, per person. (Totally worth it.)</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS WASH CLOTH!!  It shrinks to about 3/4 the size of a cotton wash cloth once wet, which suits me just fine. I had this for about 8 months, and couldn&#x27;t even part with it for a 2-week vacation! Sadly, I left it in the bathroom at the hotel so I quickly ordered another. That was over a year ago, and it&#x27;s still going strong. I recently bought my mother one, and after comparing the two I can honestly say the older one is still in great shape. I&#x27;ve tried other loofah cloths, but they all paled in comparison to Ayate. It&#x27;s a great product with enduring quality!</li>
    <li> I bought one several years ago, but forgot the brand.  If finally wore out and, because I didn&#x27;t know the brand, I bought another, thinking it&#x27;d be similar.  It wasn&#x27;t.  So I bought another, and same thing.  I finally got to this one and when I opened the package I was happy to see that it was like my old one.  It&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> Had a similar cloth before and loved it.  This one is really hard to use - really it is unusable because it just curls up tight, especially when it gets wet.  Drys curled up and can&#x27;t open it enough to scrub my body.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Great wash cloth.  The weave like designing glides on your skin yet YOU can feel the exfoliating happening.  Your skin is left smooth and soft afterwards.  The wash cloth feels very strong and doesn&#x27;t fall apart at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest using an all-natural vegetable based soap to feel the full experience.  Commercial soaps make my skin tight and itchy afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative thing is that when you first wet it, the size of it shrinks a little.  It didn&#x27;t bother me, still big enough body wash cloth, but depending on what your using it for, it might for you. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I have been using this cloth for a long time. It has become increasingly difficult to find it on the ground, and I am so happy that I was able to find it on Amazon. I had been substituting this cloth with those exfoliation gloves, and hated every minute of it--though they do work. I hope they are able to keep the ayate in stock! It&#x27;s one of my favorite personal care items.</li>
    <li> I love this as a replacement for my plastic loofah and washcloth.  It exfoliates without scratching or irritating my skin.  I also like the fact that it&#x27;s woven as it gets air in it.  As well as the fact you can throw it in the washer.  This has become my new shower cloth!</li>
    <li> Pretty rough and scratchy wash cloth but it leaves the skin very soft and not irritated at all. I even use it on my 5year old sometimes and she doesn&#x27;t mind it.</li>
    <li> exfoliates nicely without hurting, soap foams easily. leaves a very clean feeling, peeling for whole body. Would like to get another one for travel, since it is pretty small and can be packed easily.</li>
    <li> Shrinks up to approx. a 5X5 square. Very porous. The only way I have found to use it is to wrap a bar of soap in it. Not what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> this works great for exfoliating and especially getting rid of ingrown hairs. I have had mine for months and has not mildewed or molded.</li>
    <li> i looove this! i am swearing off those plastic bath puff things you find in the drugstore. this exfoliates without scratching/irritating, rinses clean, and dries well :) i have yet to try washing it in the laundry, but it is extremely sturdy so i imagine it will hold up just fine (but i&#x27;ll be putting it in a mesh laundry bag just in case). one thing that may bother some people, it smells a little earthy at first, but the smell quickly goes away. i am a dirty hippie so this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: the earthy smell is totally gone but the washcloth&#x27;s holding up great! i sent it through the washer and dryer on a normal cycle and it seems unchanged. loooove this. will be getting more when this runs out (probably, like, next year... haha)</li>
    <li> Bought these for a friend doing some work in Ghanna (Africa).  She loved them!</li>
    <li> I really like using Ayete cloths in the shower. However, for whatever reason, this last one I purchased never shrunk up properly. After multiple uses, it&#x27;s still stretched out and doesn&#x27;t hold soap well. I don&#x27;t get it because every other time I have purchased one of these, it shrank up and tightened after the first couple of uses, which made it easier to handle and more able to hold my liquid soap. I am going to purchase a new one and see how it goes, but this was definitely strange. Otherwise, these cloths are wonderful. They perform much like a loofah, but are washable, easy to handle and maneuver and work just like a wash cloth. I have very dry skin and couple this with my absolute favorite bath gel (Korres Guava Shower Gel) and it works GREAT! No sticky soap residue, soft smooth skin and less overall dryness.</li>
