      <li>This product smells good and you can &amp;#34;feel the burn&amp;#34;, however, don&#x27;t get excited because it will fizzle right out.</li>
      <li>I didnt notice any change, but it went on smoothly</li>
      <li>I just clicked into over 20 reviews since a nearly 5 star rating for an anti-cellulite cream is way too good to be true.</li>

      <li>thank you so much :)</li>

      <li>I didn&#x27;t think it really helped me to produce more sweat after a workout.  </li>
      <li>so make sure to use it as much as you need too</li>
      <li>super quick deliver.</li>
      <li>Finishing up first bottle, and getting ready to order 2 more.</li>
      <li>I noticed a change within my first week of use!</li>
      <li>Works great, I was referred by a person trainer, it&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
      <li>help my skin smooth and pretty good less celluite on my butt.</li>
      <li>It works great and you can feel the tingling from the active ingredient capsacin aka the main ingredient in Chile peppers.  </li>
      <li>I have NOT tried this product but felt compelled to post that many of these reviews are obviously planted.</li>
      <li>I do body building and love it to add the final touches in the weeks leading up to a show, or even before a vacation to the beach.</li>
      <li>This cream really makes a difference.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if any of those creams really work...</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t apply too much, it&#x27;s gives a tingle sensation..</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t the first time I have used this product and it is a good product to use on your this and butt under walking or exercising pants if you want extra help with those trouble areas.</li>

      <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who needs help with firming.</li>
      <li>I have to say these many glowing reviews all in the past few weeks are more than suspicious.</li>
      <li>Did nothing but make skin soft.</li>

<li> Wow....</li>
<li> so far 3 weeks</li>
<li> are slow but worth it.</li>
<li> but it last for a long time.</li>
<li> but cellulite goes away the only reason said 4 stars is cause it dowsnt lasst long about 2 months and</li>
<li> All of them are from the month of July and every single reviewer has only reviewed this one product.</li>
<li> As a 48 year old figure and physique competitor, I use this to firm up tummy, thigh and booty skin.  </li>
<li> it doesn&#x27;t work and it makes my skin very dry.</li>
<li> A little difference, my body fat thigh pinch was smaller , but I also workout a lot.</li>
<li> Area and utilize Groupon, I have a suggestion for you: Laser Wellness Center, 1924 Parker Ave, Holmes, PA (610-237-6645).</li>
<li> This really seems to be an unfair marketing ploy and I wish amazon would investigate.</li>
<li> If you like the way the tanning bed gives you 25 minutes of heated relaxing down time, but it destroys fat, this is the thing for you.</li>
<li> Also, I felt a slight burning sensation after a workout on my thighs.  </li>
<li> Trash doesn&#x27;t work but even a little bit.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste ur money</li>
<li> I&#x27;d say don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> No more &amp;#34;miracle</li>
<li> works, at least for me.  </li>
<li> Seriously, Amazon needs to put something in place to detect fake reviews.</li>
<li> and it has not met my expectations disappointed with product</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> super quick deliver. excellent!!!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion it does everything it says it does</li>
    <li> Trash doesn&#x27;t work but even a little bit. Don&#x27;t waste ur money</li>
    <li> These guys are smoking crack-50.00 dollars for this crud-you must be kidding-I used it and thought,  well maybe it&#x27;s working-but, would never spend that kind of money on this product</li>
    <li> I love this product...it works and happy with the results every time.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work i bought 6 bottles</li>
    <li> This stuff is AWESOME!!! I do body building and love it to add the final touches in the weeks leading up to a show, or even before a vacation to the beach. I highly recommend it to anyone who needs help with firming. You can use it anywhere that needs toning help. I use it under a neoprene belt when I work out. It works great and you can feel the tingling from the active ingredient capsacin aka the main ingredient in Chile peppers.  This is an awesome purchase and I am happy I was introduced to it.</li>
    <li> The cream did not do what it claimed it does not work; however the seller was good.</li>
    <li> Very good product it makes me sweat alot when working out</li>
    <li> Love the product amazing</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t work and it makes my skin very dry.</li>
    <li> Works great, I was referred by a person trainer, it&#x27;s a little pricey but it last for a long time. Don&#x27;t apply too much, it&#x27;s gives a tingle sensation.. But over all use a directed and result are slow but worth it.</li>
    <li> Well still using and applying cream for results</li>
    <li> The product is ok, it does make you sweat though..</li>
    <li> I have to say these many glowing reviews all in the past few weeks are more than suspicious. This really seems to be an unfair marketing ploy and I wish amazon would investigate. I&#x27;d say don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> It works wonders wonders!</li>
    <li> A little difference, my body fat thigh pinch was smaller , but I also workout a lot.</li>
    <li> Love this product, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Not for cellulite.  Used as directed.  Did nothing but make skin soft.</li>
    <li> This product smells good and you can &amp;#34;feel the burn&amp;#34;, however, don&#x27;t get excited because it will fizzle right out. I used this, paired with the Beverly Swiss Anti-Cellulite Cream. I wrapped and used a heating pad as directed, but still nothing. If reside in the Southern Jersey /Philadelphia Area and utilize Groupon, I have a suggestion for you: Laser Wellness Center, 1924 Parker Ave, Holmes, PA (610-237-6645). If you like the way the tanning bed gives you 25 minutes of heated relaxing down time, but it destroys fat, this is the thing for you. His staff and him are great and the hours are according to your needs. No more &amp;#34;miracle lotions&amp;#34; for me. Save your money and do one solid favor for your body.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot but I just have 2 weeks using it... let you later on.. thank you so much :)</li>
    <li> This cream is taking my abs to the next level.  Needed some more definition so a friend who has gotten great results suggested I try it.  Put a squirt on my abs, shoulders, lower back and sides.  Wrap myself in a neoprene waist belt.  Apply copious amounts of cardio.  When you&#x27;re done you&#x27;re sweating bullets and the waist belt is full of sweat.  Abs look more defined.  This stuff makes you sweat like a pig, which is always a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works, at least for me.  Finishing up first bottle, and getting ready to order 2 more.</li>
    <li> Wow.... I just clicked into over 20 reviews since a nearly 5 star rating for an anti-cellulite cream is way too good to be true. All of them are from the month of July and every single reviewer has only reviewed this one product. I have NOT tried this product but felt compelled to post that many of these reviews are obviously planted. Seriously, Amazon needs to put something in place to detect fake reviews.</li>
    <li> This item does work as it advertises. You do have to use it daily to see the results and in about 2 weeks you will see the difference in the areas you treat. Buying my next bottle as I am very happy with the product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if any of those creams really work...or we just want to think they do. If there is anything better bring it on.</li>
    <li> Awesome Product and Good Service.</li>
    <li> Save your money...diet ,exercise will definitely work!</li>
    <li> Cream is ok. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker you still need to watch your diet to see results</li>
    <li> so far 3 weeks and it has not met my expectations disappointed with product</li>
    <li> This cream really makes a difference.</li>
    <li> Definitely works. I was skytical and did lots of research. When you put it on it warms up especially if you work out after and thats the best way. Doesnt make you lose weight or inches but cellulite goes away the only reason said 4 stars is cause it dowsnt lasst long about 2 months and it won&#x27;t work anymore so make sure to use it as much as you need too</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the first time I have used this product and it is a good product to use on your this and butt under walking or exercising pants if you want extra help with those trouble areas.</li>
    <li> I love kind of lotion is work very good on your body help my skin smooth and pretty good less celluite on my butt. i would like order it more later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;MM</li>
    <li> I have seen results in only a week of use-- my thighs and stomach (the only places I have applied it) have definitely slimmed and toned up. When I put it on, I feel a burning heat-- not painful-- that lasts 1/2 hour or longer. It works so well that I have started investigating whether it can possibly be safe to use-- the answer is that it may not be-- read up on the key ingredient aminophylline. I am going to use it just as needed to get the look I want, and then set it aside until needed again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference</li>
    <li> I Love this stuff!  As a 48 year old figure and physique competitor, I use this to firm up tummy, thigh and booty skin.  Won&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I found this cream to work ok.  I didn&#x27;t think it really helped me to produce more sweat after a workout.  Also, I felt a slight burning sensation after a workout on my thighs.  I noticed my thighs to be a bit firmer after using this product over 3 weeks or so.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently but and I don&#x27;t see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m petite and have a bit of a belly.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!! I noticed a change within my first week of use! As a matter of fact, I will be ordering my next bottle week!!!</li>
    <li> I didnt notice any change, but it went on smoothly and I hoped it worked for others.</li>
