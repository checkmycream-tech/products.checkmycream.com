    <li> Any time of day is wonderful to rap yourself in silk.  This lotion is not too greasy but it soothes dry skin just like a rose petal. The fragrance is  fresh without having  an over baring perfume  scent.  It even comes in packs of 2 or 3 bottles that last a very long time. N&#x27;Joy!</li>

    <li> It works excellent on dry skin. Hands feet the whole body. The aroma is great and not too oily. Even like after shave!!</li>
    <li> I first tried this cream when I had my nails done at the salon. Went right home and found it on Amazon. I am addicted to the citrusy smell and the olive oil in this cream works wondered on my winter dry hands. This is the best hand cream I have ever used.</li>

    <li> Don&#x27;t purchase it except to waste you&#x27;re money</li>
    <li> This body lotion is the best lotion that I ever used and I have used MANY. It stays on you skin, dries into you skin quickly. None like it and I&#x27;ve tried some pretty expensive lotions.</li>
    <li> My nail salon gave me a complimentary tube at Christmas. As with anything I looked to find it on Amazon, and there it was, cheaper too! The smell is lemonie, calming, and not strong. Love this cream!</li>

    <li> I Love - Love - Love this Body Oil, smells great and feels fantastic!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion and can never go back to any other store bought lotions such as Bath and Body Works. This lotion feels amazing and has a good aroma (which was my biggest fear purchasing this). I purchased two bottles as a start for me and my mother and both of us are hooked on this product. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have had severely dry skin all my life--7 decades.     In the severely cold weather, even with a humidifier and other lotions, my skin cracks and bleeds spontaneously.    All others required my wetting my skin first--a good idea--but not helpful enough. It is not necessary with this brand.    The first use provided dramatic improvement, within 1-2 days I had normal skin quality,    That result on my skin is dramatic enough proof for you to order--what have you got to lose?</li>
    <li> 1st used it at a nail salon great for dry chapped hands n elbows knees exc not strong smell n works great</li>
    <li> i can&#x27;t really rate it was for a friend, she loves it has used it years ago. put some on my hand and it was smooth.</li>

    <li> I love this lotion!! I was born with eczema &amp; have Sjogrens as well so I&#x27;ve always had super dry skin so I&#x27;ve tried a lot of lotions over the years. I&#x27;m obsessed with Dream Body Olive Oil lotion- a little goes a long way &amp; it is extremely moisturizing without being too heavy or too greasy. Not crazy about the &amp;#34;detergent-ish&amp;#34; smell but who cares- this lotion is the bomb.com</li>
