      <li>I also enjoyed the follow up email with tips on how to care for them!</li>
      <li>Love these!  </li>
      <li>While I have found these to be excellent in terms of hair health (not breaking or damaging my hair), I have also found that they do not provide as secure and strong a hold for my ponytails.</li>

      <li>The colors are great and seemed true to what I saw on my screen.  </li>

      <li>What I love about them is they don&#x27;t leave a dent in your hair when you sleep with your hair in a pony tail, which I always do.</li>
      <li>will ordwe more.</li>
      <li>To top it off, seller just emailed me how to wash and take care of them.</li>

      <li>These were bought for myself and I enjoy wearing them.</li>
      <li>Well, recently I moved over to these great elastic hair ties and</li>
      <li>Great colors for blonde hair!</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;d originally thought there was just one pack in the order, for some reason).  </li>
      <li>Great hair ties that feel soft and smooth and gentle on my hair.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>Strong AND pretty!</li>
      <li>I also got a follow up email from the seller to advise on how to clean the ties for long-lasting use.</li>
      <li>Work very well, don&#x27;t leave ponytail imprints and are very comfortable.</li>
      <li>I really like ribbon hair elastics but most stretch out a lot or begin to shed.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used these for about two weeks, but so far, so good!</li>
      <li>I got the neutrals to blend with my hair, and they are very pretty.</li>
      <li>There were so many packages included that I was very pleasantly surprised</li>
      <li>The hairs ties looked nice and didn&#x27;t pull hair out when I took them off-a big plus.</li>
      <li>worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Love love love if u are sick of buy hair ties all the time and u want a good quality one buy theses there</li>
      <li>They slide right out every time.</li>
      <li>And much more gentle on the hair than normal hair bands.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using one hair tie for a few days and there are a few pulls in the fabric that make it look more worn, but I&#x27;m very happy with these otherwise.</li>
      <li>super fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>Shipping with Amazon Prime was super fast as always.</li>
      <li>4 stars, adjusted from 5 because of the price is 2-3 times higher.  </li>
      <li>I ordered several as gifts because I love using them myself.</li>
      <li>(pink was the color I chose) and feel like it&#x27;s added to my hair accessories nicely.</li>
      <li>They do not pull my hair and always look terrific, have gotten so many compliments on them.</li>
      <li>I will be be buying more in different colors ,</li>
      <li>so cute and last forever</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>These arrived quickly after ordering and the service is proactive, including a nice little e-mail explaining how to keep and care for the ties</li>
      <li>is tightly as rubber bands however for sleeping and just putting your hair up on top of her head when you want it out of your face is absolutely fine</li>
      <li>Great product and service via internet which is often hard to find!</li>
      <li>so the bands slip after several hours of wearing but that problem is easily solved by inserting a hairpin on either side of the hair tie.</li>
      <li>Comfortable and doesn&#x27;t pull out/break as much hair as regular hair ties.</li>
      <li>The order came fast.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>while they cost a little more than i would normal  spend for ties-</li>
      <li>All the colors are attractive, with a faint shimmer to them.</li>
      <li>/&gt;That said, I still love them for everyday use.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get a strong ponytail like I would with a conventional hair tie.</li>
      <li>I already have several sets of hair ties from Mane Street in various colors and like them enough to buy more.</li>
      <li>They came  quickly, and the tips that they send little tips on how to use and care for him are very helpful..  </li>
      <li>/&gt;SO much nicer than generic elastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They firmly hold my unruly hair, even during sleep, and they comfortably ride on my wrist when not in use.</li>
      <li>My daughter and I have thick long hair and amazingly these ties do not pull at our hair or cause any breakage.  </li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t fit as tight as traditional ponytail holders, but my hair doesn&#x27;t fall out or slide out of place.</li>
      <li>Certainly more expensive than the Goody ones you can buy at the pharmacy, but these Mane Street brand ones have not become stretched out as quickly either</li>
      <li>I was looking for something to use on my thick, yet fine hair type.</li>
      <li>Note: be careful with strong colors when washing as they can run a little.</li>
      <li>I typically use large ponytail holders in my hair and find that 1) the holders stretch out and 2) I sometimes get headaches.  </li>
      <li>If I really need a tight pony tail, as in when I&#x27;m working out, I use an elastic band under the tie.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> my daughter loves these!</li>
    <li> These are awesome hair ties! I ordered several as gifts because I love using them myself. I am really happy that you get to pick the colors you want. Some of the other companies on Amazon don&#x27;t give you what you think you are ordering, they may be cheap but you end up with a bunch of ugly colors. I&#x27;ll be ordering more of these! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping and my two girls love them!</li>
    <li> Great customer service, love the hair ties.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> These were bought for myself and I enjoy wearing them. They do not pull my hair and always look terrific, have gotten so many compliments on them.</li>
    <li> Love these. I have my hair up for 8-12 hour shifts at work and these keep me from getting head soreness and headaches. They don&#x27;t fit as tight as traditional ponytail holders, but my hair doesn&#x27;t fall out or slide out of place. Just the perfect amount of elasticity. Hope they hold up well. Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Comfortable and doesn&#x27;t pull out/break as much hair as regular hair ties. Also doesn&#x27;t leave giant indentations on my wrist. I&#x27;ve been using one hair tie for a few days and there are a few pulls in the fabric that make it look more worn, but I&#x27;m very happy with these otherwise.</li>
    <li> These hair ties are great!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO much nicer than generic elastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even using the &amp;#34;Ouchless&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;No-Damage&amp;#34; ties, they would pinch my hair or the fabric would rip and snag strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so with these! They slide right out every time. Highly recommend. Will buy again as necessary.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Love love love if u are sick of buy hair ties all the time and u want a good quality one buy theses there so cute and last forever also don&#x27;t pull ur hair</li>
    <li> I already have several sets of hair ties from Mane Street in various colors and like them enough to buy more. I wear these ties all day, every day and could not be happier with them. The colors in this set are beautiful, as are the colors in the other sets I own. I have not noticed any stretching or fading in the ones I&#x27;ve had for 9 months or so. I have very fine hair so the bands slip after several hours of wearing but that problem is easily solved by inserting a hairpin on either side of the hair tie. If I really need a tight pony tail, as in when I&#x27;m working out, I use an elastic band under the tie.</li>
    <li> Certainly more expensive than the Goody ones you can buy at the pharmacy, but these Mane Street brand ones have not become stretched out as quickly either, so I think the elastic must be of a better quality.  I liked that the neutral packet had two each of gold and taupe so that I could use them for pig tails.  The colors are great and seemed true to what I saw on my screen.  Shipping with Amazon Prime was super fast as always. 4 stars, adjusted from 5 because of the price is 2-3 times higher.  But I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> Love these! They&#x27;re either in my hair - day or night - or on my wrist. What I love about them is they don&#x27;t leave a dent in your hair when you sleep with your hair in a pony tail, which I always do.</li>
    <li> So far so good! I also enjoyed the follow up email with tips on how to care for them!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have thick long hair and amazingly these ties do not pull at our hair or cause any breakage.  We&#x27;ve use them to hold up ALL of our hair in a ponytail and at the ends of braids.  Thank you Julie!</li>
    <li> Great colors for blonde hair! And much more gentle on the hair than normal hair bands. I also appreciated the follow up email to make sure I received them and was happy with them. Great product and service via internet which is often hard to find!</li>
    <li> I very much like these and am so happy to find the brown colors ... lovely shades!</li>
    <li> while they cost a little more than i would normal  spend for ties- they work well. please note that i am black female with below shoulder length hair that is natural.  i use the ties while my hair is flat iron. i am not sure if the ties would hold my hair in its natural state</li>
    <li> The hairs ties looked nice and didn&#x27;t pull hair out when I took them off-a big plus.</li>
    <li> These hold hair well in a ponytail and are gentler to user than previous hair ties I&#x27;ve tried.  If they get stretched out a little, they can be revived by hand washing gently and drying for a short time in the dryer (use a lingerie bag) or air drying if you don&#x27;t need any shrinkage.  Note: be careful with strong colors when washing as they can run a little.</li>
    <li> worth every penny. super fast shipping.  i like how you can wear them on your wrist and they look like a bracelet.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny! They seem expensive till you experience using them.  They stay put, don&#x27;t create deep ridges and don&#x27;t damage your hair. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the cheep copies you find at the grocery store. They look like the same product, but you&#x27;ll discover after using both, they are not the same!</li>
    <li> Great ties! Would buy again!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve only had them a week but they&#x27;re a hit with my constantly-pony-tailed girls!</li>
    <li> I love these, and I especially enjoyed the email I received with care instructions to increase the life of the hair ties. I do think they&#x27;re unnecessarily overpriced, though. I guess that&#x27;s what happens when you know you have a better product!</li>
    <li> Fantastic purchase!! Could not be happier. These are not a brand I recognize but I will be buying more. To top it off, seller just emailed me how to wash and take care of them. A+++++ seller and product!</li>
    <li> I really like these hair ties, with a few caveats. I have thick, heavy straight hair, so even wrapping them three times (which I can baaaaarely do) I don&#x27;t get a strong ponytail like I would with a conventional hair tie. I expected this, but I was still a bit disappointed. I can&#x27;t even come close to using them for my runs, as my hair falls as soon as I&#x27;ve run a few steps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I still love them for everyday use. I can put my hair in a loose ponytail that&#x27;s softer looking than with conventional ties, and I can even put them a little higher up, though they tend to fall a bit (seriously, I&#x27;m not lying when I say my hair is heavy). All in all, I would buy them again, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect any miracles from them.</li>
    <li> I have extremely long hair and these hair ties do not pull my hair out. They are not is stretchy is rubber bands you do not hold your hair is tightly as rubber bands however for sleeping and just putting your hair up on top of her head when you want it out of your face is absolutely fine it&#x27;s great. If you&#x27;re going to run some miles in them then you need something else. But other than that they are wonderful hair ties and they did not pull your hair out.</li>
    <li> Quick arrival from seller, and the ties are the best I&#x27;ve used. They firmly hold my unruly hair, even during sleep, and they comfortably ride on my wrist when not in use. All the colors are attractive, with a faint shimmer to them. Five stars. I also got a follow up email from the seller to advise on how to clean the ties for long-lasting use.</li>
    <li> Ordered two packs of different colors as gifts.  Colors were very nice- true to picture.  Also seemed well-made.</li>
    <li> I really like ribbon hair elastics but most stretch out a lot or begin to shed. I&#x27;ve only used these for about two weeks, but so far, so good! For reference, I ordered the set of all black.</li>
    <li> Great hair ties!! Work very well, don&#x27;t leave ponytail imprints and are very comfortable.</li>
    <li> I typically use large ponytail holders in my hair and find that 1) the holders stretch out and 2) I sometimes get headaches.  Well, recently I moved over to these great elastic hair ties and no more headaches and they haven&#x27;t stretched out.  I have really thick hair so I was skeptical if the hair ties would hold my hair up all day, but it did and at the end of the day, I didn&#x27;t have the all too familiar head ache before bed.  I&#x27;m enjoying the array of colors in my selection (pink was the color I chose) and feel like it&#x27;s added to my hair accessories nicely.</li>
    <li> While I have found these to be excellent in terms of hair health (not breaking or damaging my hair), I have also found that they do not provide as secure and strong a hold for my ponytails. Additionally, because the holders are made of a wide, thin material, they fold and stretch out more than I would care for.</li>
    <li> Still deciding how I feel about this type of hair tie for my hair/needs, but quality of product and service level have been great.</li>
    <li> Perfect hair ties.  These work great in my hair.  They are stylish, great elastic that holds my fine hair in place without breaking my hair.  They came  quickly, and the tips that they send little tips on how to use and care for him are very helpful..  I will be be buying more in different colors ,</li>
    <li> Love these - they do not pull my hair and are comfortable!!</li>
    <li> These arrived quickly after ordering and the service is proactive, including a nice little e-mail explaining how to keep and care for the ties so I can get more use out of them.  There were so many packages included that I was very pleasantly surprised (I&#x27;d originally thought there was just one pack in the order, for some reason).  I plan on using Man Street Hair Ties in the future and would definitely recommend them to a friend.</li>
    <li> Great hair ties that feel soft and smooth and gentle on my hair. I was looking for something to use on my thick, yet fine hair type. Everything else pulls a lot and feels so tight whrn I have to put my hair in a bun for work. These worked great. I got the neutrals to blend with my hair, and they are very pretty.</li>
    <li> Love these!  Strong AND pretty!</li>

    <li> The hair ties are really cute.  The order came fast.  I&#x27;m hiding them in Easter eggs for my 2 girls, so they haven&#x27;t seen them yet, but I know they&#x27;ll love them.  I hope they let me borrow them!</li>
