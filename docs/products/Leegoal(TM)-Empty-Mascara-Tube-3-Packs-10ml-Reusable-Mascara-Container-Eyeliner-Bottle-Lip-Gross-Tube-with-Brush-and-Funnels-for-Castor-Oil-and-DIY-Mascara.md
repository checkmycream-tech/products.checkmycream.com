      <li>I buy these in bulk now, and this is a great way to get more for your money than buying so many fewer for a high price at places Sally Beauty Supply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>They are decently constructed and do a great job on the feeders.</li>
      <li>I find these to be much more sanitary than a spoolie brush and while they are cheap, they get the job done</li>
      <li>The brushes come off of the stick part way too easily</li>

      <li>The bristle are soft and of a good quality</li>
      <li>Yes, still very worth the price.</li>
      <li>I originally purchased these to apply castor oil to my lashes and brows to promote thicker hair growth</li>
      <li>, my daughter wanted some to clean her fish tank hoses as well as some for her eyelashes</li>

      <li>Shipping from China was fairly quick, too.</li>
      <li>Descent quality for the price and one time use arrivied quickly</li>
      <li>It was delivered quickly.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used about 20 so far and one was able to separate brush from stick.</li>
      <li>Took a little while to get here, but very nice quality.  </li>

      <li>The length is just right and the package can be opened so that each wand brush is pristine when removed.</li>
      <li>Great product considering it&#x27;s such a low price.</li>

      <li>My old mascara brush is no longer available at CVS.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great price and came quicker than most vendors from China. Good sturdy quality.</li>
    <li> ALWAYS A PLEASURE WHEN I SEE THIS IN THE MAIL.. AND ALWAYS EARLY</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and was as described. I&#x27;ll be using these for treating my lashes with oil so I expect they&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
    <li> will work for what I need them for</li>
    <li> They are simply that, they are exactly what you expect from mascara wands. Great for the price, no complaints from me.</li>
    <li> great for what i need them</li>
    <li> OKAY QUALITY WISE, BUT TOOK ALMOST 2 MONTHS FOR THEM TO ARRIVE</li>
    <li> Very sturdy, long lasting and easy to work with.</li>
    <li> As described, came quicker than expected.</li>
    <li> I purchased this on December 29th.  I bought these because of the number you get and the price.  These should arrive between Jan. 23rd - Feb. 4th.  Really?!  If I would of known that these would take so (unreasonably) long, I would of gone to a beauty supply shop to buy so I can have in hand.  Very, very unreasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will try to update to review the product when I finally get it.</li>
    <li> large amount for the small price</li>
    <li> I like having these disposable eyelash spoolies to groom my eyebrows and eyelashes. They come in handy for anyone who does their make up, or applies make up to others. I originally purchased these to apply castor oil to my lashes and brows to promote thicker hair growth but I use these for a variety of reasons now in my make up collection. These are your sanitary option as you don&#x27;t want one of those permanent spoolies hanging around, touching multiple eyeballs and collecting bacteria. I find these to be much more sanitary than a spoolie brush and while they are cheap, they get the job done and I haven&#x27;t had any break in any way. If you need to, you can bend and angle the spoolie on the applicator stick to get into harder to reach areas for more precision. If you&#x27;re looking for cheap disposable spoolies, these are the ones to go to. They arrived in a timely matter, packaged in a small ziplock bag.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered and expected.  They don&#x27;t fee cheap and they don&#x27;t goop up the mascara like some other wands to.</li>
    <li> does what I brought them for</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> My old mascara brush is no longer available at CVS. Was happy to find these. They separate the lashes beautifully. One brush lasts about 20 applications. The price is so reasonable, I always have more on hand. Good stocking stuffer, too.</li>
    <li> Good quality.  I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist, and I use these on my clients.  It&#x27;s more sanitary than using the one provided with the mascara.</li>
    <li> Great amount of disposable wands for the price! Worked well for the mascara at the Regional and National Cheer Competitions :)</li>
    <li> Great time, arrived sooner than expected.  Very pleased with product, thought were disposable but are very resistant wands.</li>
    <li> It was exactly as it was described in the details and they work great.  Highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> Got here quick! It said they were suppose to arrive between July 22-August and it arrived today, July 8th! They look really good! Can&#x27;t wait to use them this weekend!</li>
    <li> Nice and thick eyelash wands.</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price.  I am using these for my homemade mascara.  I was glad to find someone who sold them without the tube.  The plastic isn&#x27;t the strongest but it hasn&#x27;t bothered me yet.</li>
    <li> I love them. Great price.</li>
    <li> I found a mascara that has a screw on lid without having the wand seal it. Now I use that mascara with the disposable wands.  I dip it once in the tube and use it on both eye&#x27;s  and don&#x27;t dip it again, throw it away.  My eyes are happier.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t shed and that would be the only thing to worry about with a disposable I believe, these are someone short tho</li>
    <li> I buy these in bulk now, and this is a great way to get more for your money than buying so many fewer for a high price at places Sally Beauty Supply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these for sure for any makeup artist. They are well made, as well as disposables anyhoo, and shipped well.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this  product.  I was worried that the comb or the base would be whimpy but they are solid.</li>
    <li> These are very versatile and worth the money! I purchased them to use with oils for my eyelashes and eyebrows. However, I have found a dozen other uses for them. They are great to have on hand and are no less sturdy than the actual wand that comes with your mascara tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love to use them to separate my eyelashes after I have applied mascara. If you wear mascara, you know that trying to separate your lashes can sometimes lead to clumping and an overall mess. With these, I have a clean wand with no product on it. Definitely helps to keep my makeup looking clean and natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a makeup artist or anything so I can see these lasting me a very long time. They could also be cleaned and reused but I am too lazy to do that. I would definitely recommend them!</li>
    <li> Placed my order March 27th, it is now April 18th and I dont have them yet. However my NEW estimated date of delivery is April 24????? I just hope it&#x27;s of this year. Cant review the product because I still don&#x27;t have it.  However I would recommend using another vendor. I wish I was allowed to give it negative stars, unfortunately, I&#x27;m forced to give it one star to many.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift for a budding young make-up artist.  The length is just right and the package can be opened so that each wand brush is pristine when removed.</li>
    <li> I sell mascara and needed disposable wands for demonstrations.  These wands are perfect.  They hold a lot of product on them so I only need to use one wand at a time for multiple layers.</li>
    <li> This was great! It was just as described in the description box. There perfect when using it for eyelash extensions. Delivered in perfect time</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t need an order so big, but for the price I figured, why not?!?!?  Great product, well made, good quality and just what I needed!</li>
    <li> Great buy &amp; awesome price!</li>
    <li> I loved the product but it took about a month to deliver. I was a little worried that the product would be too flimsy and cheap but it was actually a very strong and nice product. My only complaint is the month wait. I use these for my business so I cant wait that long for my orders to arrive.</li>
    <li> They work as expected</li>
    <li> This are good for eyebrows and mascara works perfect for both things. Perfect for makeup artist or makeup seller ....prevent pink eye.</li>
    <li> Great product considering it&#x27;s such a low price.</li>
    <li> These never showed up so I cannot comment on their quality as I never got to use them. I am incredibly disappointed and so I do NOT recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product. Prompt service.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why these had to be shipped with other objects.  They are light the shipping involved isn&#x27;t a lot... So when they arrived I almost forgot I had ordered them bc it came in its on bubble wrap package...  Product is great just the shipping involved is annoying</li>
    <li> My wife loves these because of all her alergies.  Single use prevents contaminating the contents of the tube so she can use it all instead of throwing away 2/3 &#x27;s.</li>
    <li> nice large pack for the price. cant beat it!</li>
    <li> As described, however shipping took a long time.</li>
    <li> Perfect to use for applying lash serums and touching up brow application.  If using for lash serum, I don&#x27;t use more than a couple of times or days without cleansing just to be sure there&#x27;s no bacteria on them to infect my eyes.</li>
    <li> Took a little while to get here, but very nice quality.  I use these to apply castor oil to my eyelashes at night.</li>
    <li> Great to give client with a full set of eyelash extensions</li>
    <li> they  are  the  best  thing  ever</li>
    <li> Nice to get these in bulk like this for the price. They are standard decent sized brushes and soft but firm. I will say to just give a slight tug to make sure certain that the brushes stay on the black stick. (You&#x27;d begin to see the post) I&#x27;ve used about 20 so far and one was able to separate brush from stick. Out of 100 if even 5 do that, that&#x27;s ok by me. That one coulda been a fluke, and I&#x27;m glad it wasn&#x27;t in the bottle when I noticed because I may not have been able to get it out. I guess it could happen with regular mascara wands as well. But just a heads up. Would I still buy again? Yes, still very worth the price.</li>
    <li> Works great for lash extensions.</li>
    <li> excellent for the price</li>
    <li> Great for a makeup artist!</li>
    <li> These are top quality lash brushes.  Be sure to order them knowing it might take awhile.  Being a pro make up artist, I can get a large quantity without breaking the bank.</li>
    <li> Mascara wands are good quality. The only complaint I have is that they took a long time to arrive...but, they came from Hong Kong which was understood afterwards.  So If you need them right away this may not be the acenue, but if you have time this is an excellent purchase</li>
    <li> used for lashes and brows, good product</li>
    <li> Awesome quality for the price. Shipping from China was fairly quick, too. I&#x27;ve decided to use these exclusively to keep my mascara sanitary.</li>
    <li> great product for our business.  (photography with make-up and hair)</li>
    <li> These wands give you a very nice feathered lash effect. The brush looks just as the photo giving me excellent mascara coverage without getting clumpy.</li>
    <li> These are super cheap. The brushes come off of the stick part way too easily and so far I have lost several inside my mascara tube - COMPLETELY defeats the purpose of these. I&#x27;ll be buying another brand.</li>
    <li> I love using these with a homemade lash &amp; brow serum. Perfect for one time use. I also keep a few in my purse for brow touch ups.</li>
    <li> These are the disposal mascara tubes I bought to use with my oil mixture to make my eyelashes Grow as though you&#x27;re wearing false lashes, these wands are great for applying</li>
    <li> Received order.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I received exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Use these for eyelash extensions, good quality.  For the price and quantity, its a good deal, would buy this product again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hair stylist and a facial waxer. These little wands are perfect for shaping the brows to wax. As well as using them to dye the brows.</li>
    <li> I AM A MAKEUP ARTIST AND THESE ARE perfect for clients when you dont have brushes and do not want to use them on clients</li>
    <li> love this one.  its from china</li>
    <li> Nice to have when you have an eye infection.  You can still use your make up and toss the brushes so not to contaminate the make up.</li>
    <li> These work great I use them to apply my coconut oil to my lashes each night, to help my lashes griw</li>
    <li> Great quality and great price.  I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better deal.  Would definitely order this product again when needed.</li>
    <li> clean can use for multiple purposes</li>
    <li> Although these are disposable eyelash brushes, I purchased them for a totally different purpose - to clean my hummingbird feeders. I originally got the idea when I was looking for something to clean the hummingbird feeders with and came across 3 brushes for $6 that looked just like eyelash brushes except that they each had a different colored handle. For the difference in price, I took the chance and got ordered the Leegoal Sheenroad 100 pcs Disposable Eyelash Mascara Applicator Wand Brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great brushes! They are decently constructed and do a great job on the feeders. Not only that, but my husband wanted some for his tool chest, my daughter wanted some to clean her fish tank hoses as well as some for her eyelashes and my son took a few for using on his crafts. There&#x27;s a multitude of things one can do with these brushes and to say I&#x27;m well pleased with my purchase is a huge understatement!</li>
