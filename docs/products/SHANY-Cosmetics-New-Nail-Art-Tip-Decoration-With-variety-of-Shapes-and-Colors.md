<li> The tin is the size of my hand and has barely anything in there.</li>
<li> Product came to me with gems loose in package.</li>
<li> The product box was still closed, but somehow all of these tiny pieces escaped and are a mess in the box.</li>
<li> i was looking for all round stones in different colors.</li>
<li> They are very, very small shiny rhinestones in different shapes and colors ~ which I was looking for the variety, just not expecting such a miniature size.</li>
<li> I dropped half of them on the floor when opening.</li>
<li> Half of the sequins were spilled in the box when we got it.</li>
<li> I got a refund as this is useless to try to pick up 2000+ tiny shiny specks.</li>
<li> Very small!</li>

    <li> Nothing like what&#x27;s pictured. The tin is the size of my hand and has barely anything in there.</li>
    <li> Product came to me with gems loose in package. I dropped half of them on the floor when opening.</li>

    <li> Got for  daughter  for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Came as shown, great product, and speedy delivery</li>
    <li> These are SO TINY!!! They are very, very small shiny rhinestones in different shapes and colors ~ which I was looking for the variety, just not expecting such a miniature size. I could have maybe dealt with it, but the package came and these tiny tiny shinies were ALL over the Amazon box. The product box was still closed, but somehow all of these tiny pieces escaped and are a mess in the box. Who knows how many I lost in transit. I got a refund as this is useless to try to pick up 2000+ tiny shiny specks. Thanks anyways........</li>

    <li> Very small! Great price!</li>
    <li> beautiful but too small, hard to work with</li>
    <li> The rhinestones are really small and it&#x27;s not as many as pictured...but since they weren&#x27;t costly I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Nice quality and diversity of colors. Happy With purchase!</li>
