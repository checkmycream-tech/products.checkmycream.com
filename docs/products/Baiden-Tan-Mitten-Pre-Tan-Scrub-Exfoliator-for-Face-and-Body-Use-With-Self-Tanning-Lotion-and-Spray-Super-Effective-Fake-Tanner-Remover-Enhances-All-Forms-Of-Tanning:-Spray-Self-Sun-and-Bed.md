      <li>GOT MY SPLOTCHY SPRAY TAN OFF! :)</li>
      <li>I am glad that I got Baiden Tan Mitten .</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true it gives you a nice tan, but i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to people with farmers tans.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!!</li>
      <li>The Baiden Mitt people have sent me detailed emails regarding the use of their product, very enlightening!</li>
      <li>so I was very lucky.</li>
      <li>I am going to keep it up and bet I will think it is 5 star worthy!</li>
      <li>After I got the mitt in the mail I received numerous follow up emails from the maker of the product giving me great tips and checking on my satisfaction.</li>
      <li>and I tried it again a week later and had great results.  </li>
      <li>It also leaves your skin really smooth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a filipino and hispanic male, both these races can be fairly dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Hands down the absolute BEST exfoliation product on the market!  </li>
      <li>The skin on my face is so clear and smooth now, much better than when I was using the Clairisonic Mia 2.  </li>
      <li>New product for me, so far does an amazing job, but still kind of new for a review, but the five stars are for customer service!</li>
      <li>I used this last week: exercised then took a long shower, scrubbed off a layer of my skin, then used the St Thomas self tanning foam, and I still have a great tan!  </li>
      <li>WORTH EVERY $$$</li>
      <li>I was so excited to try this based on the reviews and didn&#x27;t even care about the high price.</li>
      <li>so I had very smooth and even skin for my next tan session.  </li>
      <li>My arms look better, I used to have the keratosis pilaris bumps, and tried the creams, the baiden mottos the only thought cleared them up.  </li>
      <li>My first time I did on my arms</li>
      <li>Finally, I don&#x27;t have to walk around embarrassed anymore! :)</li>
      <li>my tan has been more even &amp; longer lasting.</li>
      <li>The 2nd time it worked much better</li>
      <li>It made my skin silky soft after the first use!  </li>
      <li>and I do think it went on much smoother and streak-free.  </li>
      <li>so my legs didn&#x27;t get exposed to the sun that much</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I has read so many reviews on other sites, all positive and finally made the purchase.</li>
      <li>What I was not expecting, was the owner to reach right back and explain what was happening...</li>
      <li>removed my self tanner completely</li>
      <li>As a tanning industry professional this product does work.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t remove old tan residue</li>
      <li>I used it at the end of showers to scrub my legs and get any old tanning product off</li>
      <li>I rinse it out with really hot water when I&#x27;m done then hang it outside to dry.  </li>
      <li>I was skeptical about a loofah mitt that cost this much, however justified it by the company&#x27;s money back guarantee as well as a two year life span.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It really works great. I use it specifically to get rid of fading spray tan and to prep my skin for the next spray. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Very interesting product. My skin was never sensitive to the mitt so I was very lucky. I used it at the end of showers to scrub my legs and get any old tanning product off and boy did this thing work! After I got the mitt in the mail I received numerous follow up emails from the maker of the product giving me great tips and checking on my satisfaction. I use the mitt all the time and my skin feels softer and smoother. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I love my Tan Mitt - it is one of the best purchases I have made for my skin. I do spray tan and since I started using the mitten my tan has been more even &amp; longer lasting. I have been recommending this to all of my friends and family.</li>
    <li> These things are wonderful.  I have used others that were way, way too rough, and I do not have particularly sensitive skin.  I use it on my face, including lips, every day.  I heartily recommend this product!</li>
    <li> very effective!  removed my self tanner completely so I had very smooth and even skin for my next tan session.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a filipino and hispanic male, both these races can be fairly dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up I was left in the sun with a tan on my arms and face, which is known as a farmers tan. I didn&#x27;t wear shorts so my legs didn&#x27;t get exposed to the sun that much, they&#x27;re a different tone from my arms. This gives me my insecurity of wearing shorts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing how this says it removes tan, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. My first time I did on my arms I noticed the dead skin rolling off, i also used it on my legs. When I went to go tan (covering my arms and wearing a hat), I did notice my legs got a nice tan 2-3 days into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use the mitten for the second time on my arms the dead skin rolled off, but the next day my arms barely looked lighter. It&#x27;s true it gives you a nice tan, but i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to people with farmers tans. It also leaves your skin really smooth.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the BEST exfoliating item I&#x27;ve ever used! Worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> As a tanning industry professional this product does work. however you can buy the same thing for $10 (korean body scrub mitt).</li>
    <li> GOT MY SPLOTCHY SPRAY TAN OFF! :) Finally, I don&#x27;t have to walk around embarrassed anymore! :)</li>
    <li> I love this mitten!  It made my skin silky soft after the first use!  Work&#x27;s great to take off sunless tanning product too!! I love it!  I use it twice a week for best results. Anyone who spray tans should use this! It makes your tan so much more even and it lasts alot longer too!! I&#x27;m so glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> Hands down the absolute BEST exfoliation product on the market!

    <li> I has read so many reviews on other sites, all positive and finally made the purchase. I was so excited to try this based on the reviews and didn&#x27;t even care about the high price. What I was not expecting was for my body break into bumps all over, it looked like I had chicken poxs and freaked out!  I wrote a terrible review and reached out to the seller.  What I was not expecting, was the owner to reach right back and explain what was happening...with my body releasing toxins and I should give it time.  She was so professional that I calmed down.  In a few days my skin completely cleared up and I tried it again a week later and had great results.  While I did not have layers of skin come off, my skin was very smooth and felt great.  I am going to keep it up and bet I will think it is 5 star worthy!</li>
    <li> This is the best exfoliation ever and my tan is totally even. I used this the night before a spray tan and usually my legs get splotchy, but not this time.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing!  My arms look better, I used to have the keratosis pilaris bumps, and tried the creams, the baiden mottos the only thought cleared them up.

    <li> I have only used the Baiden mitt twice but I think it&#x27;s a keeper!  The first time I was afraid to rub too hard thinking it would irritate and I also left the shower running so didn&#x27;t get the best results.  The 2nd time I pressed harder (not to the point it was painful, just firm pressure) and I turned off the shower while doing it. The 2nd time it worked much better and my skin felt very smooth. I immediately followed it with self-tanning and I do think it went on much smoother and streak-free.  I will continue to use the Baiden mitt and fully expect to see improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture in the coming weeks.</li>
    <li> New product for me, so far does an amazing job, but still kind of new for a review, but the five stars are for customer service! The Baiden Mitt people have sent me detailed emails regarding the use of their product, very enlightening! Spot on customer service!</li>
    <li> I cannot explain how much one little mitt can change the way you see your skin!!!! Just keep it out of the dryer and don&#x27;t let your husband accidentally bleach it and it will last you eons..... I don&#x27;t soak in a tub so I just use it at the end of my showers and get amazing results. I promise you will, too, don&#x27;t hesitate to spend the cash, think of all the other wasted money that did nothing for your skin....THIS PRODUCT DELIVERS!!!!!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t remove old tan residue</li>
    <li> Am using the Baiden Tan Mitten  as guided. I started seeing difference .Baiden Tan Mitten is tremendous!!!! I am glad that I got Baiden Tan Mitten .</li>
