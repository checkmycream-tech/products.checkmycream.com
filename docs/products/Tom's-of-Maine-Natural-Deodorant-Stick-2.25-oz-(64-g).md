      <li>my favourite is &#x27;Honeysuckle Rose&#x27; but all the others are great as well.</li>
      <li>It is a good alternative to the chemical based deodorants.  </li>
      <li>fragrance is quite pleasant, though I don&#x27;t detect any Honeysuckle or Rose in it.</li>
      <li>, normally I love their products!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>This product smells great and provides a nice light coating that keeps the B.O. away.</li>
      <li>By the end of the day you will smell like warm lemonade.</li>
      <li>nice smell too.</li>
      <li>Smelled nice in the container but did nothing for my armpits.</li>

      <li>It smells nice for about an hour, and by 3 hours you need to wash the pits and reapply.</li>
      <li>The person saying it smells like Vick&#x27;s, etc., has some kind of dysesthesia.</li>

      <li>I like the scent of this better, but kiss my face brand works better, even if doesn&#x27;t have as good scent choices as this one.</li>
      <li>I have a very strong suspicion, a BURNING suspicion, that &amp;#</li>
      <li>nice, safe product for those who are conscientious about the aluminum in our environment.  </li>
      <li>I wish this had a bit more rose smell.</li>
      <li>For a Natural Deodorant this works the best.</li>
      <li>I do need to reapply during the day, but by far Tom&#x27;s products are the best!</li>
      <li>The deodorant is very light</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased to say it kept me fresh all day!</li>
      <li>, normally I love their products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love tom&#x27;s, but this doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
      <li>Lovely scent, works, non-irritating.</li>
      <li>Love the brand, don&#x27;t ever stop producing.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t hide any smell and makes me sweat more</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>fact, it smells mostly like lemongrass.</li>
      <li>I love Tom&#x27;s products.</li>
      <li>To top it off, it seems to irritate my skin and cause an itch.</li>
      <li>I take meds that make me sweat more, so after giving briefs my armpits would be soaked.</li>
      <li>Aluminum free is the way to go!</li>
      <li>I stick with the HoneySuckle Rose or Soothing Calendula, both of which are zinc free.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d think most people desire more from a deodorant than that.</li>
      <li>(okay maybe 21,22 hours some days),</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say at the most it can promise 6 hours of effectiveness.</li>
      <li>This one seemed to be the most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>MANY years.  </li>
      <li>On the plus side I have not had any more issues with yeast infections under my arms...</li>
      <li>MANY years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>this is great for those who are very sensitive to any chemicals</li>
      <li>Now that is budget friendly :-)</li>
      <li>Could not use to strong...</li>
      <li>But I can tell you what smelt strong,</li>
      <li>It smells nice at first</li>
      <li>and it seems to be working fine.</li>
      <li>the trade off is to be all natural and stinky, or full of chemicals and smell great</li>
      <li>For those of you that can&#x27;t wear regular deodorant this is a great choice</li>
      <li>Enjoy knowing this is aluminum free.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this deodorant, as I try not to use products with too many un-natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>I was excited about trying a deodorant, free of aluminum, that would work.  </li>
      <li>A fun day!  </li>
      <li>Clean with a capital C, but not floral at all.</li>
      <li>The honeysuckle is my favorite scent and of course anyone looking at Toms knows it&#x27;s free of the chemicals pervading modern America&#x27;s food, drinks and toiletries</li>
      <li>Feel better about using a more natural product.  </li>
      <li>After using aluminum based, fabricated scent deodorants, this product is a pleasant change.</li>
      <li>So if you&#x27;re looking to stay away from certain kinds, make sure you read all the labels.</li>
      <li>Smells good but not lang lasting.</li>
      <li>Since eating healthier and living free of chemicals I&#x27;ve rarely needed to use a deodorant.</li>
      <li>I love all Tom&#x27;s products, this company offers high-quality and effective natural products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpaste, love it and decided to try its natural deodorant.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a farm, it HAS to be a fun</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s also &#x27;Natural&#x27; unscented if you&#x27;d prefer something more neutral.</li>
      <li>I ordered this because I didn&#x27;t want the chemicals from antiperspirants anymore, and wanted something more natural.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all natural and safe...  </li>
      <li>The only reason I&#x27;m giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because it does smell nice when it goes on.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a FARM, I was confident my slight BO surely wouldn&#x27;t be noticed, right?</li>
      <li>Also it would be good for a kid to use as its first deodorant due to its mildness</li>
      <li>...had the unscented and the honeysuckle rose is a light scent and enough to last a day&#x27;s worth of working with elementary school children...</li>
      <li>/&gt;The scent to me is pretty mild, not like vicks, not like anything much really.</li>
      <li>The lavender scent is very mild and actually probably does a better job with my skin and natural body essence than the Apricot scent.  </li>
      <li>PS  back to healthy eating</li>
      <li>I was pretty smelly and thats just sitting at a desk typing all day.</li>
      <li>Simply, healthy living cuts back dramatically on body odors.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;PS  back to healthy eating</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this is great for those who are very sensitive to any chemicals&lt;br /&gt;i spent $3.oo on a name brand deodorant and ended up&lt;br /&gt;in urgent care epi pen shots breathing treatments due to&lt;br /&gt;allergies to the name brand product..this is great..it works&lt;br /&gt;the scent is gently no hives no blisters no breathing treatments&lt;br /&gt;it works great..</li>
    <li> The only deodorant I wear...nice smell too.</li>
    <li> And that is indeed an ingredient in this deodorant. Works perfectly for me! I don&#x27;t sweat that much without an antiperspirant so this works perfectly! Glad I bought it!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent coverage even for the worst of odors, and doesn&#x27;t sting that much on open sores. I have hidradenitis suppurativa, and it even works on that odor all day and overnight without irritating the skin.</li>
    <li> Really didn&#x27;t work for me, by the end of the day I was pretty smelly and thats just sitting at a desk typing all day. And I do NOT have a problem with odor control. I think this is the first time I have ever put on deodorant and in less than 24 hours started to smell like BO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent to me is pretty mild, not like vicks, not like anything much really. But I can tell you what smelt strong, my pits after a day with this deodorant. E[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the trade off is to be all natural and stinky, or full of chemicals and smell great I take smelling great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad I bought two sticks at once :(.</li>
    <li> I agree with some previous reviewers that this product burns your armpits after shaving. I thought I&#x27;d chance buying it anyways, but it was pretty painful for a long period of time.</li>
    <li> smells great, my g/f was allergic to most types but this works well and smells great.</li>
    <li> Smells peculiar, doesn&#x27;t help with body odor smell, and leaves my underarms feeling wet. On the plus side I have not had any more issues with yeast infections under my arms...</li>
    <li> This is a great product, no aluminium, pleasant scent and lasts for ages. I would highly recommend this product - my favourite is &#x27;Honeysuckle Rose&#x27; but all the others are great as well. There&#x27;s also &#x27;Natural&#x27; unscented if you&#x27;d prefer something more neutral.</li>
    <li> really great product ..  Ive been using the toothpaste and now this and Tom&#x27;s have really great products to offer..</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this. The only reason I&#x27;m giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because it does smell nice when it goes on.  I knew I would still sweat, since this is a deodorant and not an antiperspirant.  But the problem is about half way through the day my underarms stink more than if I had not applied anything. And I&#x27;m not a super-sweaty stinky person, just work in an office with no strenuous activity. I suggest you give it a try though, and just see if it might work for you.  I&#x27;m going to try other natural deodorants; I really am concerned about the aluminum in regular antiperspirants.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for almost 30 years. It&#x27;s the best stuff out there and all you will need. Lovely scent, works, non-irritating. The person saying it smells like Vick&#x27;s, etc., has some kind of dysesthesia. It&#x27;s the only possible explanation. I don&#x27;t know what to make of it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hide any smell and makes me sweat more</li>
    <li> It smells nice at first but it does not last for very long at all. I start stinking again within a few hours, and it irritates my pits. They&#x27;ll get red, itchy, and rashy after using it. I want to like this product, but I really cannot.</li>
    <li> It gets foamy under your arms. It smells nice for about an hour, and by 3 hours you need to wash the pits and reapply. Sad. :(</li>
    <li> I purchased this at my local Target.  The scent is great, but it burned and stung so bad on my freshly shaved pits. I had used a brand new razor blade, so I know I did not have any razor burn. Also, I could smell my self within 2 hours. I will keep looking for an aluminum free deoderant that is longer lasting</li>
    <li> really like it...had the unscented and the honeysuckle rose is a light scent and enough to last a day&#x27;s worth of working with elementary school children...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I would order this again.  It does the job as far as not sweating but leaves my underarms sticky</li>
    <li> I wish this had a bit more rose smell. Or honey suckle. Works like other Toms Deoderants. But not as aromatic.</li>
    <li> For a Natural Deodorant this works the best. I do need to reapply during the day, but by far Tom&#x27;s products are the best!</li>
    <li> This product smells great and provides a nice light coating that keeps the B.O. away. Love it! Aluminum free is the way to go!</li>
    <li> Every single person I talk to about Toms deodorant, regardless of the scent, seems to have a different experience with it, so I&#x27;m not sure reviews are the place to go when considering this purchase. For me, it works perfectly, no smell for 24 hours (okay maybe 21,22 hours some days), but I know a lot of people that say it either doesn&#x27;t work at all for them or it leaves them sweaty or smelly after 6-8 hours.  The honeysuckle is my favorite scent and of course anyone looking at Toms knows it&#x27;s free of the chemicals pervading modern America&#x27;s food, drinks and toiletries but again you just have to try it to see if it works for you as it does for me</li>
    <li> Smells good but not lang lasting.</li>
    <li> The deodorant prevents perspiration but it smells like citrus, there&#x27;s nothing floral about the smell. By the end of the day you will smell like warm lemonade.</li>
    <li> not so great it will ware off midday! smells great however, I tried this in apricot smelled strong at first but not later on</li>
    <li> Three stars because my daughter, 7, likes it... I bought it for her when she has sports or gym and it seems to be working fine. It&#x27;s all natural and safe...  But, I personally would not use it. I tried it and it goes on very dry, like it isn&#x27;t even on you and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it would work at all. I put on &#x27;real&#x27; deodorant after an hour.  Careful, different versions of Tom&#x27;s deodorant does contain different ingredients. So if you&#x27;re looking to stay away from certain kinds, make sure you read all the labels. This one seemed to be the most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this with the natural ingredients, aluminum-free, etc. But it just doesn&#x27;t have the staying power. I&#x27;d say at the most it can promise 6 hours of effectiveness. I&#x27;d think most people desire more from a deodorant than that.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this Tom&#x27;s of Maine product on Amazon.  Not just because I happen to BE from Maine...but because I LOVE all the Tom&#x27;s products and they are getting difficult to find in the usual stores I always bought them at!  I was afraid they were being phased out...or going out of business...but seems they&#x27;re still going strong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this deodorant for several reasons but the newest one is because I read an article about breast cancer and the nasty ingredients found in regular deodorant was found in MOST of the women who had breast cancer.  Especially in those who shaved their arm pits.  Think about it...a close shave (which is what we all strive for) opens up the skin to enable a chemical to go directly to the lymph nodes...(something like that!)  Any opportunity I can get to cut my cancer risk I&#x27;ll take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to refuse to use a &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; deodorant, fearing they would fall short in the sweat/odor department but that wasn&#x27;t the case at all!  I&#x27;ve even tried the &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; (that&#x27;s the only one found in our area right now) and I NEVER thought the unscented, all natural deodorants would work...but guess what...they DO!  Amazing!</li>
    <li> It is a good alternative to the chemical based deodorants.  Also it would be good for a kid to use as its first deodorant due to its mildness</li>
    <li> The deodorant is very light so it gives a very good feeling on the body as if you did not use. At the same time it is very powerful so goodbye any bad odors.</li>
    <li> nice, safe product for those who are conscientious about the aluminum in our environment.  Would definitely recommend this to others</li>
    <li> I love Tom&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and this deodorant not only caused a horrible and ugly breakout under each arm, but it caused a strange smell that I don&#x27;t even have!</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I didn&#x27;t want the chemicals from antiperspirants anymore, and wanted something more natural. I really like the honeysuckle rose scent, but by the end of my work day, I can detect a slight odor. Let me tell you, I sit at a desk all day, and the product is sold as \\&quot;long lasting\\&quot;. I also don&#x27;t sweat much, but I find myself applying numerous times a day to stay fresh.</li>
    <li> Could not use to strong...it gave me a boil&lt;br /&gt;...</li>
    <li> Smelled nice in the container but did nothing for my armpits.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this deodorant, as I try not to use products with too many un-natural ingredients. It smells nice and goes on like you&#x27;d expect but it didn&#x27;t really hold me over as long as other deodorants. It is a great product, I just wish it lasted longer.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time.  Works great</li>
    <li> Well, the product is NOT a antiperspirant like i wanted, and it does keep me from smelling bad during my 8 hour work day. Downside it doesn&#x27;t smell anything like honeysuckle and rose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, it smells mostly like lemongrass. Which, while its not an unpleasant smell, is not what i wanted to smell like when i bought the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since i feel kinda jipped in that department, but considering it still does its job as a deodorant, 3 outta 5.</li>
    <li> Smells great when going on but doesn&#x27;t stop the BO.  I live in the desert so in the summer just walking to the car creates a lot of sweat.  A couple of hours after applying and I can smell myself already.  I started using the &#x27;ammonium alum&#x27; crystal deodorant which worked great but found out that it contains Aluminum as well.  Guess I will keep looking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of the scent, but I could have gotten past that if the deodorant lasted all day. I bought it bc it was all natural and is not supposed to leave a residue. Well it does not leave a residue, or practically any sign that you put it on that day. Thank goodness I am not a heavy sweater because this stuff does not last all day.</li>
    <li> I prefer natural based products.  Since eating healthier and living free of chemicals I&#x27;ve rarely needed to use a deodorant. Simply, healthy living cuts back dramatically on body odors.  I&#x27;m not sure why I picked up this Tom&#x27;s of Maine, I guess it was to have a backup on hand &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34;.  Well today was that &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;d eaten cardboard pizza this week.  I know, I know.  But it was convenient. So now I&#x27;m dealing with the consequences... bloating and fatigue were bad enough.... could it get any worse?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was supposed to meet with a group of people today (only a few showed up) on a nearby farm. After I showered this morning I realized I had some underarm BO.  Ewww!  Not good!  Not enough time to deal with it, I threw on some of this deodorant.  No more smell, pleasant floral scent.  It&#x27;s a FARM, I was confident my slight BO surely wouldn&#x27;t be noticed, right? I went to the farm where the meeting was scheduled to take place.  A typical spring-like St. Louis day - low 80s, breezy, light humidity.  A fun day!  It&#x27;s a farm, it HAS to be a fun day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just 6 hours later, my armpits are absolutely on FIRE !  I&#x27;ve showered, I&#x27;ve scrubbed really well, delicately well, and I&#x27;ve put FREEZER COLD flannel cloth under those delicate folds trying to sooth them until this reaction dies down again. UGH!  I should have just done without deodorant, afterall it&#x27;s a FARM, right?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really truly feels like a reaction I have to lavender.  I&#x27;ve thoroughly read and reread the entire label and ingredients list, there is no lavender listed but there IS &amp;#34;natural fragrance&amp;#34;. What on earth is &amp;#34;natural fragrance&amp;#34;??  Everything else is listed on the ingredient list, so why not declare what NATURAL FRAGRANCE really means?!  I have a very strong suspicion, a BURNING suspicion, that &amp;#34;natural fragrance&amp;#34; is &amp;#34;lavender&amp;#34;!  Why do I think this? Because I&#x27;m ALLERGIC to LAVENDER.  I don&#x27;t let anything personal care come into my home with lavender, I know this burning pain far too well, unfortunately.  And it isn&#x27;t razor burn... I&#x27;ve had laser hair removal, I&#x27;ve not had to shave my pits for YEARS. MANY years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you too suffer from any type of LAVENDER allergy, steer clear.

Steer clear, steer very clear.  Had I initially realized this contained propylene glycol I would definitely never had bought the product.  Learn from my mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m rating ONE star, I&#x27;d give it NO stars, due to undisclosed ingredients.  and I&#x27;m throwing this container in the trash.  I&#x27;m very disappointed in Tom&#x27;s, normally I love their products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS  back to healthy eating I go.  and what I usually do is in the shower scrub with a bit of baking soda or soak some epsom salts in and around the arm pits, massaging those lymph nodes.  It&#x27;s soothing, helps the body to detox AND eliminates those body odors!  It&#x27;s also helpful to spray magnesium oil into the arm pits, massage the lymph nodes, allow it to soak in a little while then shower shortly after.  It does a body good!  while it also eliminates all need for ANY type of deodorant making these products entirely unnecessary.

    <li> It was a little bit of a different experience - not using an antiperspirant.  But had no  problem with the deodorant aspect.  Feel better about using a more natural product.  Nature want us to sweat.</li>
    <li> Great deodorant. Smells really nice.</li>
    <li> I bought this deodorant because I had run out of my old one and really wanted one that was aluminum free. In that regard, I suppose it&#x27;s a good option, but it doesn&#x27;t last long. Even before half my day is over I can tell I need deoderizing. I have to carry it with me everywhere now for reapplication.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like it, but it doesn&#x27;t even lasts 12 hours. I like the scent of this better, but kiss my face brand works better, even if doesn&#x27;t have as good scent choices as this one.</li>
    <li> For those of you that can&#x27;t wear regular deodorant this is a great choice</li>
    <li> I love all Tom&#x27;s products, this company offers high-quality and effective natural products.</li>
    <li> The lavender scent is very mild and actually probably does a better job with my skin and natural body essence than the Apricot scent.  I actually don&#x27;t get the white residue like I did after taking a shower using the Apricot product.  I never get skin peeling with either brand.  Enjoy knowing this is aluminum free.  I must say though, the scent is very mild - I can hardly smell it on me which is a good thing (would mean more chemicals and that defeats the purpose of this product).  With the Apricot I think looking back I smelled the natural body odor much quicker in the day than in using the Lavender.  Keep in mind I&#x27;m a stay at home mom.  My day is at home keeping house, changing diapers, dishes, laundry, taking kids to and from school, grocery shopping, homework, breakfast, lunch, dinner.  I&#x27;m active but not doing marathons.  Hope my review helps you.</li>
    <li> I have worn it in every situation you could think of getting sweaty in (running, soccer, lifting weights, working outside in the Texan sun,etc.) and it hasn&#x27;t failed me yet! I love this stuff! Works really well!</li>
    <li> This just doesn&#x27;t work for me; I feel like I smell worse when wearing it. The smell of the stick and the smell of it on me are two entirely different things (the latter being rather unpleasant). To top it off, it seems to irritate my skin and cause an itch. I appreciate that it&#x27;s a natural product and I wanted to like it, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Female, 25, moderate perspire-r.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to test Tom&#x27;s of Maine Honeysuckle Rose Natural Deodorant out for a day of tilling, weeding, planting, watering, building garden boxes, and hauling over 100lbs of compost around my quarter acre of paradise. I&#x27;m very pleased to say it kept me fresh all day! It even held up to the stress-sweat that came from teetering on a ladder to string up a guideline for some Jessamine to creep along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s clear and dries very quickly and leaves no waxy or greasy residue or white stains like \\&quot;regular\\&quot; deodorant. It feels like I&#x27;m not wearing anything at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is quite pleasant, though I don&#x27;t detect any Honeysuckle or Rose in it. This smells like shaving cream, lavender, and citrus bath soap, in that order. Clean with a capital C, but not floral at all. It&#x27;s a very Unisex fragrance and I&#x27;d recommend it for both men and women. It&#x27;s light, too, so it won&#x27;t smell weird with your cologne or perfume (or fill a 5 foot radius around you with an obnoxious cloud of fragrance when you raise your arms, like regular Deodorant does).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of my 8 hour + day the fragrance was gone but I did not detect any, uh, pit odor. I can&#x27;t really say if this is 24 hour protection or not since of course I took a Silkwood shower after all that and then reapplied it.</li>
    <li> Used this product for years. I love it.</li>
    <li> Great product, I&#x27;m a fan. I take meds that make me sweat more, so after giving briefs my armpits would be soaked. This helps reign it in. I still sweat some, but not as much as I do without the deodorant or trying others. I also tried the extra strength, expensive  Secret and Degree, those didn&#x27;t work, but Tom&#x27;s of Maine works well for me.</li>
    <li> I love tom&#x27;s, but this doesn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;m searching for a aluminum/paraben free deodorant that actually works for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpaste, love it and decided to try its natural deodorant. The Long Lasting Honeysuckle Rose smells uniquely vibrant and applies clear. It&#x27;s not an antiperspirant so it won&#x27;t prevent sweat. After using aluminum based, fabricated scent deodorants, this product is a pleasant change. There are several scents to choose from, some of which contain zinc. I stick with the HoneySuckle Rose or Soothing Calendula, both of which are zinc free. Another great product from Tom&#x27;s. Love the brand, don&#x27;t ever stop producing.</li>
    <li> I was excited about trying a deodorant, free of aluminum, that would work.  Unfortunately, this product does not control odor or wetness.</li>
