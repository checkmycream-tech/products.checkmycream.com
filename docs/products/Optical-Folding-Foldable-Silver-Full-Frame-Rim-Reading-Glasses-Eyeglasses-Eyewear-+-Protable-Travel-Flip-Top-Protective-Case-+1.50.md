<li> The ear pieces do seem just long enough for my wife.  </li>
<li> It took a long time to get since it came snail mail from China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The case is about 1/2 the width of some other folding glasses, but similar height and thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> They are not something I would wear all the time, or for a long period, as they are not very comfortable, especially the way they sit on one&#x27;s nose.</li>
<li> The case is much smaller than other folding reading glasses I have tried - about the size of a typical lighter.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Not worth claiming $9.99 + $3.99 shipping, so I just write this down as bad experience, but I hope you do not waste your money.</li>
<li> The nose pads are small, and not very far apart.</li>
<li> I would recomend them to anyone who does not like to have glasses on all the time and does not like to carry a big bulky case.&lt;br /&gt;The small heavy duty case makes them just ritht to keep in my tackel box.</li>
<li> The Foster Grant folding glasses include a couple nose pieces to improve comfort, but those are missing from these cheaper products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Really really small.</li>
<li> The ear stems unfold but are so short as to be useless.</li>
<li> I like the hard case as well as the space they save</li>
<li> Folding the arms on the outside of the lenses makes it awkward to unfold and fold and encourages leaving fingerprints on the lenses.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t waste your money are time to look or even buy this!!</li>
<li> /&gt;Diopter indication is not good.  </li>
<li> poor quality, looks like you get what you pay.</li>
<li> Lousy construction.  </li>
<li> it is very poor design!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I like the ideal of the folding arms very convent at a great price.  I would order several pair because I always need reading glasses and never can find a pair.  great ideal.</li>
    <li> Lenses and case work as they should.  The folding/telescopic arms are not long enough to warrant the crook for the ear since they don&#x27;t reach.  Folding the arms on the outside of the lenses makes it awkward to unfold and fold and encourages leaving fingerprints on the lenses.</li>
    <li> The glasses arrived 12 days after ordering. They were well packed, individually with foam wrapping and a hand written note card included! The glasses and case seem well constructed and were described very well. Just check out the photos and that is what you get!</li>
    <li> Very good eyeglasses with a small carrying case.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and in good order. Worked well and were easy to fold and put into case. Liked frame color and construction.</li>
    <li> Handy and work great.</li>
    <li> When I ordered the glasses, I did not realize that they were supposedly shipping from Hong Kong. I received them in two weeks, longer than I was hoping for, but within the amount of time that I was told to expect them. However, the shipping envelope listed the address of San Leandro CA, not Hong Kong - odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the glasses themselves, they seem functional and arrived in good condition. They are not something I would wear all the time, or for a long period, as they are not very comfortable, especially the way they sit on one&#x27;s nose. The nose pads are small, and not very far apart. In addition, the style would better suit my grandmother, and they look narrow on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fine for reading a menu, but I would use for something else to read a novel.</li>
    <li> Good size and good quality lenses.</li>
    <li> Handy and sturdy, I carry it in my back pocket and sit on it without any ill effect.  Great value, what a help for reading glass users.  Cannot understand why other products are priced so high at around $20.</li>
    <li> Really really small. I doubt these will fit most men. The ear stems unfold but are so short as to be useless. Result, I tossed them out.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t read carefully enough, and now have a child&#x27;s&#x27; pair of readers. They seem to be well-made, however</li>
    <li> poor quality, looks like you get what you pay.</li>
    <li> Just received my pair.  Just broke my pair.  Lousy construction.  It took a long time to get since it came snail mail from China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diopter indication is not good.  I ordered a 1.5 and I currently have a 1.0 (non prescription)and 2.0 (prescription)and I can see better with both - even the 1.0 non prescription!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth claiming $9.99 + $3.99 shipping, so I just write this down as bad experience, but I hope you do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> Better quality than I expected.  Not as good as Foster Grant, but half the price or less.  The ear pieces have spring hinges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a decent product overall, but I feel the price with shipping is higher than it should be.  If it were $5 shipped, this would totally be a 5-star product.  They are flimsy, and will probably break, but if the price were cheaper I would simply buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort-wise, I&#x27;m not a fan of having a prominent hinge on the inside of the bridge.  The Foster Grant folding glasses include a couple nose pieces to improve comfort, but those are missing from these cheaper products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These glasses are TINY!  In a good way!  The case is much smaller than other folding reading glasses I have tried - about the size of a typical lighter.  The case is about 1/2 the width of some other folding glasses, but similar height and thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the case itself, the material appears flimsy, and it was imperfectly machined so that the lid appears \\&quot;bent\\&quot; (not actually, the sides are just not equal length)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped directly from China, so it took a couple weeks to arrive, but that was expected.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to be able to carry extra glasses in the car, the truck, and in my purse without breaking them.  I like the hard case as well as the space they save</li>
    <li> The quality exceeded my expections. I wanted the fold up because they are easy for me to carry along in my coat pocket. Works fine. I would recomend them to anyone who does not like to have glasses on all the time and does not like to carry a big bulky case.&lt;br /&gt;The small heavy duty case makes them just ritht to keep in my tackel box.</li>
    <li> I Love it, fits in my tiny purse. My husband is always using it! The price is great I recommend it!</li>
    <li> took to long  to come directly from china. Liked Readers Microvision W-Case 1.50&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;FOSTER GRANT&amp;#34; better. Has a smaller more flat case</li>
    <li> The first pair I received had one ear piece that was shorter than the other. I contacted the seller and after confirming the defects via emailed photos, the seller sent me a new pair. The new pair had equal length ear pieces, but they were too short for me.  The ear pieces do seem just long enough for my wife.  When compared with othe reading glasses, the ear pieces on theses were shorter. Foster Grant makes some really good foldable reading glasses. I went with them.</li>
    <li> Great product with a great price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money are time to look or even buy this!! it is very poor design! look at something better</li>
