<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have bought this chair three times now.  It works well. Just make sure to put it together correctly. The hydraulics of the chair are a little tricky at first.</li>
    <li> This chair was more than I expected. It has a very sleek and sexy design which compliments any room. Assembly is painless and I would recommend this chair for anyone looking to make their clients comfortable while they are being groomed. Must buy!</li>
    <li> awsome chair , i am short so i can lean my clients so i can better reach them. also good when ido straight razor shaves!</li>
    <li> llego defectuosa, no funciona bien y es hecha en China con una calidad muy mala. Ademas me aparece un cargo por $79 este mes de Diciembre por algo que no he comprado, no existe un # de telefono en Amazon donde se pueda llamar</li>
    <li> I tell you all what any body looking for a great Barber chair for only a 100!!! bucks this is the one! i look for hours trying to find a good chair that will meet what i needed to do and get for a good price. I came across this one and read the other reviews on it and had to try it.So if your in need of a good baber chair this is it. the only thing shipping is 68 but all worth it. FYI i also had a little Trouble getting the seat Kushing down but other than that fast shipping and good deal!!! get yours fast!!</li>
    <li> Base is not heavy enough but serves the purpose.</li>
    <li> BestSalon® New Black Hydraulic Recline All Purpose Barber Styling Chair Shampoo, Well I bought this for my wife, I will say it was easy to assemble, no problem there, the price was right, she says..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I have been a professional cosmetologist for over 20 years, this chair is no where near the worst, and no where near the best chair I have ever used. I have a small salon in my home (and I mean small) I see a client or 2 a week, and for the set up I have it works just fine. However, if I were looking for a chair that was going to have high traffic, this is not the chair I would choose. The hydraulics work, but the chair will not lower enough for me I am 5&#x27;6\\&quot; not tall not short, if you are taller than 5&#x27;6\\&quot; you might not have the problem of the chair not going low enough, but if you are shorter than 5&#x27;6\\&quot;, I hope you like wearing heels.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The quality and construction are mid-range again if you plan on high traffic (6 to 10+ clients a day/ 4 to 5 days a week) this is not the best choice for you. If however, you do 1 or 2 clients a day or 6 to 10 clients a week (and don&#x27;t plan on growing your business) it might work for you. It is pretty sturdy, but with heaver clients, the hydraulics work, but are a bit of a challenge.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Affordable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: NOT heavy duty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Misc: If you need a chair fast this is a good \\&quot;spare tire\\&quot; It will last just long enough to get a chair that is more comfortable for you and your clients..</li>
    <li> It arrived promptly but with a tear in the vinyl and the rubber protective gasket around the bottom was completely shredded. The back of the chair was pretty scratched as well. The entire chair is rather flimsy but is to be expected, being made in china. For the money the chair will serve it&#x27;s purpose but it would&#x27;ve awesome if it didn&#x27;t have all the shipping damage.  Hopefully you&#x27;ll have better luck than i did</li>
    <li> I bought this chair for my boyfriend.  He wanted something simple that both reclined and had the hydraulic pump.  This chair was great.  The only complaint he had was the assembling instructions were quite awful and it took a little longer to put together without more descriptive instructions.  Outside of that he loves it and I think it was a great purchase!!!</li>
    <li> i looked for a decent all purpose chair but they were all very expensive found this one great price easy to put together and it works great i love it</li>
    <li> This item I bought for my mom&#x27;s beauty salon it ok. If you have chunky customers the arm rest dig into there thighs. But other than that its good. Simple to use.</li>
    <li> this chair is a real great chair, it has the same features as the ex pensive ones but look so much sexier,a must have at any barber shop. highly recommended</li>
    <li> I purchased this chair for my Mother that is unable to travel to town anymore to get her hair done. I was impressed with the quality of this chair. For the price this is really heavy duty  and will work great for what I need it for. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it ! I have read some other people knocking the chair. but I feel it is a great value. My only complaint is the packing of the product, it had a few scratches on the chrome base and a small tear on the back of the seat. That doesn&#x27;t bother me, they were small. This is not the sellers fault, it is the suppliers. They need to spend a little more time wrapping the product to prevent damage during shipping. When I received it the box was pretty beat up, so if you do buy one and the box is damaged open it and check your item first. If you are looking for a top quality salon chair to use everyday you may want to spend the extra money and buy a top of the line chair. I feel it would make a good Salon chair personally and would buy one again.</li>
    <li> Great...I do recommend...</li>
    <li> just got the chair delivery was fast .its not to stable my old seat feels better its kinda easy to tip it over wish it had more cushion overall its an ok chair not the best i personaly would not rcomend this to a top cuting barber</li>
    <li> Arrived boxed in new condition. Did not take long to set up. Looked really sharp in the barber shop. Recommend selling child booster seat along with chair as a package deal.</li>
    <li> This Chair is beautiful , and the seller delivery was beyond expectaion  very fast and friendly . I will buy from them again Thank you.  Celi.</li>
    <li> Pretty easy to install.  Rubber ring for the base comes off in three days of ownership.  Recline is good.  Hydraulics is okay; could be stronger.  Locking position doesn&#x27;t seem to work well.  Smaller size. Overall okay price for okay product.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase of this chair, it was easy to put together, and is very comfortable to sit in.</li>
    <li> Came fast but defective. I took pictures of the defective part, sent them to company. Customer service was excellent!!! They sent me a replacement part quickly and the chair works. For home use it&#x27;s perfect. Not sure about salon. What do you expect for 200$???!!!</li>
    <li> This has been the best chair ever! Ok, its a bit high for me cuz Im only 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; but it fits perfectly with my sink. I have an all in one and love it!</li>
    <li> This chair was very poorly made super uncomfortable for a client specially if she was big person I was very unhappy with this purchase big waist off money had to buy another one</li>
    <li> good quality. We are using them at our tattoo shop. Work well for arm and chest pieces. Light weight but extremely durable! Been using these chairs for over a year and no issues!</li>
    <li> FAST DELIVER AND GOOD PRICES</li>
    <li> it does&#x27;nt spin very easily..which just sucks... i dnt use this chair much because that reason. a waste of my money</li>
    <li> The styling chair works very well it is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Nice chair for the price for my small at home salon.</li>
    <li> I like this chair with the exception that it needs to sit lower.  As in the hydraulics need to allow you to go down further.  I don&#x27;t think I am a very tall woman at 5 ft. 5. so I wander what the average height person this was made for.  Overall, it is a nice beginners chair.</li>
    <li> Good construction, good quality material, works fine, looks nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the weight is not light enough to consider moving it around a room continouosly,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t let the negative reviews sway my decision. We just put this chair together and I&#x27;m very happy with it. It was very easy to put together, just a few screws that were kind of hard to get to, but probably took me 10 minutes total. The seat of the chair is wider than any chair I&#x27;ve used in the past so the comments about larger clients having their thighs dig into the sides is hard to believe. I have not had any clients sit in this chair because my salon isn&#x27;t open yet, but I will be using it as a waxing chair and at the shampoo bowl. I love that the recline lever is on both sides and I love how easily the chair returns to the upright position. Other chairs I&#x27;ve used in the past I&#x27;ve had to push the back of the chair (and the client) up and were quite difficult. The look and feel of this chair is very modern. It feels very sturdy, the leather on the seat feels nice and thick (not like it will tear easily.) Until I get the chance to try it out for a few days I can only give it 4 stars, but so far I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. I can&#x27;t imagine how much better a $500 chair could be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;November 30, 2015 Edit: This chair has been amazing. I&#x27;m still happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> it did come inside a beat up box with holes all over it and the gasket for the stands rim was ripped...but over all this is a great chair..head rest is flimsy too..</li>
    <li> The seat padding is a little firm  but the chair is strong and can easily support a larger person. you cant beat the price.</li>
    <li> I like the chair alot. I need it this chair because it reclines. The only thing that I am not so fond of is the headrest. It&#x27;s difficult to put it in or take it out. Other than that the chair is great!</li>
    <li> Excellent condition! Works smoothly and is comfortable. Great chair! Exceeded expectatioin! Light weight and easily moveable. First professional chair but it compares to those in salon!</li>
    <li> Take my advice and don&#x27;t waste your money on these chairs. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because they are aesthetically pleasing. If t</li>
    <li> Awesome , love the it&#x27;s perfect for in home stylist. It&#x27;s comfortable and was very easily assembled. Perfect for side work</li>
    <li> I bought these chairs for my salon we do threading very nice comfortable the only think is some of them not moving idk if I miss something while putting them together or they just dont turn but so far they good</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and was  a very pleased customer. What more can a happy customer ask for ..Bravo Zulu as we say in the military</li>
    <li> less than what we expected.  :(</li>
    <li> Just what the Barber Needed and at a great price. Delivery was quick and package was well protected. Perfect for home or shop.</li>
    <li> rubber ring is worth nothing falls off in a couple of days like another poster mentioned; stains vinyl floor rust stain; up &amp; down mechanism doesn&#x27;t work in a year of ownership!!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this choice because it meets the needs of the household.😀</li>
    <li> very efficient and easy to put together,  recommend it for any tattoo artist who needs an easy to clean chair that is fully adjustable.</li>
    <li> My chair arrived early in excellent condition. It was very easy to assemble. It&#x27;s very cute and it&#x27;s perfect for the space I have &amp; the cost was very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I definitely loved the chair, it was in perfect condition and was an awesome price also so i couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> It meets all expectations for the basic purposes intended.Thanks.</li>
    <li> good one, but only probelm is after fitting very hard to remove top chair from bottom. some horrible adjustments of for backside... Sold it in month in just $80 to local guy..</li>
    <li> These chairs did not come with the hardware or the attachments for the foot rest.  I contacted the company with pictures of the defective items, and they send me the attachments for a different model. SO needless to say I have two chairs still  with out the proper fittings for the  foot rest. The chairs do  seems sturdy, and I have had a few heavy clients in the chair in the recline position, and I have not have any problems with the stability of the chair. Although, a foot rest is a must for the comfort of the clients.  I was able to get someone to weld the foot rest to the bottom of the chair, Although, I know that this fix is probably temporary....... Since the price was not that high for the chairs I was willing to keep them with the fix of welding instead of going through the trouble of returning them.  Lesson learned... I got what I paid for, if you want a good chair, look for something at a little higher price range.  I only give them a 2 star for stability. Customer service is  not up to par with this company.</li>
    <li> We purchased a pair of these. They were in good shape with no issues when they arrived. The instructions for assembling them are not quite as clear as they could be but not too bad either. The arms &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; a little flimsy because we are use to arms that connect in two places where these only connect in one place and hang out in space at the front of the chair. But they are not actually flimsy. It is just different from what we are use to. So far these are working very well. Hope to give more feedback in a few months after we have used them for a while.</li>
    <li> I really like this chair! smooth hydraulic n easy to pump.</li>
    <li> Nice cutting chair but very tipsy.</li>
    <li> Works great so far! Easy to put together.</li>
    <li> The chair came packed very nicely. There was a strong chemical odor that seemed to lessen as the days passed. I planned on returning the chair because it does not spin freely like most salon chairs unless you keep the foot pedal pressed as you spin it. This was too much of a hassle for me. The seller refunded my shipping costs after contacting them to let them k ow I was unhappy , but not the price of the chair. I was able to re- sell the chair for what I paid for it, so I guess it&#x27;s a wash. This would be a good shampoo chair or maybe tattoo chair, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for a styling chair</li>
    <li> Smells  horrible, low quality,  I can&#x27;t even attach the neck rest, cheap</li>
