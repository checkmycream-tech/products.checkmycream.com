      <li>Nothing good to report.</li>

      <li>but you can use an alcohol free moisturizer(Like jojoba oil or another great WI product-</li>
      <li>Yes, it&#x27;s my own fault for trusting - but I would like to have seen a prominent part of the description featuring the fact that this is an aluminum-based antiperspirant, not cactus-based.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The itching and dryness will get better over time and it becomes more effective after using it for a while.  </li>
      <li>I love this deodorant.</li>
      <li>I put it on every 5 days and skip the deodorant which for me makes me sweat and smell more.  </li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>You will be satisfied with the results.</li>
      <li>Can use every 4-5 days with pretty good results.  </li>
      <li>, I would wait a good hour after showering to put it on other wise</li>
      <li>and I can wear a gray shirt without getting huge sweat patches,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy to support a local business.  </li>
      <li>klima is super strong, worth the price, and better than anything you find for 5 dollars at your grocery store.</li>
      <li>okay guys - let me start by saying i never write up product reviews, in fact this is literally my first ever review.</li>
      <li>Sure it burns when you first put it on but 5 minutes of discomfort is worth 4-6 days of no sweat.</li>
      <li>This is the second time I have used this product, it worked fairly well for me in the winter , but not as well in summer time, still will sweat but not as often.</li>
      <li>you have mild hyperhidrosis</li>
      <li>The first use I was 100% sweat free.</li>
      <li>I researched many options even considered surgery because I was determined I wasn&#x27;t going to live with this problem</li>
      <li>Thanks Klima!!</li>
      <li>Works really good, kept me dry and without odor for 3 to 4 days!</li>
      <li>This product is worth every dollar.</li>
      <li>this product has inspired me to write my first review simply through how effective it is.</li>
      <li>and use this if you want to wear gray on a hot day again</li>
      <li>Thanks Klima!</li>
      <li>the first 2-4 weeks</li>
      <li>I have been sweat-free for the first time since I was a child since I started using the product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different ways, and nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Ok I initially tried this</li>
      <li>also, apply it right after a shower, and to prevent most of the itching and burning just wait until you are completely dry.</li>
      <li>I followed the instructions on the package, and even let the pits \\&quot;dry\\&quot; much longer than the described 15 seconds.  </li>
      <li>Really have to follow the directions</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t  really sweat when I wear it.</li>
      <li>I was very depressed to have this condition</li>
      <li>I think it really burns/stings.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping every time I order.   </li>
      <li>I guess the fire from the alcohol was too much.</li>
      <li>Absolutely does not work</li>
      <li>I give it five stars, it really meet my expectations I will recommended to friends and family</li>
      <li>I seem to sweat more if I add other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, make sure to spray so much on that it&#x27;s running down your side.  </li>
      <li>First of all, it barely reduced the problem.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products that worked for a few months then quit working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This will wear off after the second week, just man up its worth</li>
      <li>there are few better options out there</li>
      <li>Your probably going to need a new bottle every month or so</li>
      <li>I live in the heat of south florida</li>
      <li>/&gt;After the first week, my puddles came back.</li>
      <li>I dont have sensitve skin but developed a rash.</li>
      <li>Really does help block odor and sweating on a daily basis.</li>
      <li>My skin is a bit sensitive though.</li>
      <li>Would not recommend for individuals who actually perspire more than a few drops a day.</li>
      <li>in fact, purchasing klima was my last attempt at finding a decent antiperspirant before seeing a dermatologist.</li>
      <li>but its still way cheaper and less risky than surgery, which I honestly believe is the only other option.</li>
      <li>The product promises results the first week that the burning and itching would dissapate, but for me, that was not true.</li>
      <li>It is going to hurt the first few times but don&#x27;t touch it</li>

<li> I exercise vigorously and after an hour at the gym, my back, chest, arms, head, everything is drenched in sweat, but my armpits are dry.</li>
<li> B00142DBWC Extra Dry Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant Cream 1 oz.]]  </li>
<li> I do get large puddles, but they are hidden if I keep my arm down.</li>
<li> But if you have puddles that take over your entire underarm, this product will just make that puddle a little smaller.</li>
<li> It does really dry the skin</li>
<li> and they said you have to let it dry before putting on.    </li>
<li> If your underarm feels dry then wait another 5 minutes before spraying.  </li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the tip about using a blow dryer to dry it.</li>
<li> I put it on around 10-15 minutes after I get out of the shower and my arm pits are dry.</li>
<li> That&#x27;s the only down side.:</li>
<li> and I constantly had to look for clothes that would make it less noticeable.</li>
<li> personally answered my questions within a few hours of me sending an email</li>
<li> It works, plain and simple.</li>
<li> The longer you wait for your underarm to dry the less irritation you&#x27;ll have if any.  </li>
<li> the other reviews said.....</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t use any other product now.  </li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried teaming Klima Antiperspirant with other antiperspirants but no luck.</li>
<li> even though it says you dont have to use daily, I would if you are prone to really sweat when stressed or tend to get over exicited and tend to have bad BO</li>
<li> But before I went shopping for clothes that weren&#x27;t black for once</li>
<li> Did not work, not even a little bit after 8 sprays each arm.</li>
<li> if you truly have a problem with excess sweating then just splurge a little on klima.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I have always had trouble with this.</li>
<li> , I wanted to give it a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> prior to klima i would sweat through everything, even while just sitting at my desk in the dead of winter - super embarrassing stuff - basically, imagine the worst case of armpit sweat you have ever seen</li>
<li> But it really really dries out the skin in my arm pits... like bad.</li>
<li> I have looked for something to prevent excessive sweat in my clothing for years</li>
<li> don&#x27;t consider myself to have EXCESSIVE hyperhidrosis.</li>
<li> and i have yet to have a problem with excessive sweating</li>
<li> i&#x27;ve been using klima for the past 5 or so months</li>
<li> for years i had excessive perspiration and couldn&#x27;t find a way to cure it.</li>
<li> I began to really notice my Axillary Hyperhidrosis at 18 and hated it and spent ages trying everything to get rid of it.</li>
<li> After washing the dress shields a couple of times; the plastic inside became hard, cracked and make crunching sounds.  </li>
<li> and he said he suffers from hyperhydrosis so he totally gets it!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Absolutely does not work</li>
    <li> This product is worth every dollar. You will be satisfied with the results. I use it once every 4 days and can wear what I want now</li>
    <li> I actually got this to be used as a deodorant not  for sweating and it works but often makes my arm pits itch and get a bit red and irritated.  That&#x27;s the only down side.:(</li>
    <li> Its long lasting for order and wetness like for one day 8 hours.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have used this product, it worked fairly well for me in the winter , but not as well in summer time, still will sweat but not as often. I would buy again but even though it says you dont have to use daily, I would if you are prone to really sweat when stressed or tend to get over exicited and tend to have bad BO</li>
    <li> Ok I initially tried this and it looked like it bleached my shirt but the bleached areas actually washed out.  I have been sweat-free for the first time since I was a child since I started using the product.  It does really dry the skin but you can use an alcohol free moisturizer(Like jojoba oil or another great WI product- Look Ma! No x-ma) in between uses to alleviate this.  The itching and dryness will get better over time and it becomes more effective after using it for a while.  Can use every 4-5 days with pretty good results.  This company has excellent customer service- I had questions about using this and the head of the company personally answered my questions within a few hours of me sending an email and he said he suffers from hyperhydrosis so he totally gets it!  Also as a native Sconnie I&#x27;m so happy to support a local business.  Fast shipping every time I order.   Thanks Klima!!</li>
    <li> Actually works.. Great stuff</li>
    <li> Not as good as one I bought a couple of years ago</li>
    <li> It worked for 2 days....then stopped. I would not recommend this to anyone. The product promises results the first week that the burning and itching would dissapate, but for me, that was not true. This product had my arms on fire. I guess the fire from the alcohol was too much. I dont have sensitve skin but developed a rash. The company even says that 90% of the users did not have to use it for up to 5 days...then it says if u have \\&quot;severe odor\\&quot; to shower daily &amp; use Klima daily...who doesnt shower/bathe daily?? Anyways i will not purchase it again nor recommend it.</li>
    <li> Ive gone through 3 bottles of this stuff and it&#x27;s the only thing that works. Sure it burns when you first put it on but 5 minutes of discomfort is worth 4-6 days of no sweat. I exercise vigorously and after an hour at the gym, my back, chest, arms, head, everything is drenched in sweat, but my armpits are dry.</li>
    <li> I use to perspire like crazy and had to wear dress shields to keep from ruining my clothing.  After washing the dress shields a couple of times; the plastic inside became hard, cracked and make crunching sounds.  I was so thankful to discover Klima.  I don&#x27;t use any other product now.  Thanks Klima!</li>
    <li> Burned my arms just like the other reviews said.....can&#x27;t recommend this stuff and ended up with ingrown hairs from a rash.</li>
    <li> Very good product. It worked for me.</li>
    <li> not the best not the worst ... there are few better options out there</li>
    <li> I read a recommendation online and decided to buy this product. I feel burn in my underarm the minute a spray it. Now my arm still red and itchy after 3 days.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and works perfectly if you follow the directions.  If you are getting irritation underneath your arms after spraying it, it&#x27;s bc you are spraying on too soon after the shower.  Let your underarm air-dry for about 15 minutes or with a blow dryer for 7-9.  If your underarm feels dry then wait another 5 minutes before spraying.  The longer you wait for your underarm to dry the less irritation you&#x27;ll have if any.  I used to itch like crazy in the beginning then I called them and they said you have to let it dry before putting on.    I put it on every 5 days and skip the deodorant which for me makes me sweat and smell more.  Also, make sure to spray so much on that it&#x27;s running down your side.  Finally Irish Spring seems to work the best soap wise and if you need deodorant Arrid XX Cream works best for me when I do use it.   [[ASIN:B00142DBWC Extra Dry Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant Cream 1 oz.]]  Good luck!</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant. This is my 2nd buy. I use it only couple of times a week, after I shower before bed time. I use a regular deodorant daily. This combo works great!</li>
    <li> Did not work, not even a little bit after 8 sprays each arm. Would not recommend for individuals who actually perspire more than a few drops a day.</li>
    <li> I have always had trouble with this. I can use this, when I get out of the pool and it still works!!</li>
    <li> I give it five stars, it really meet my expectations I will recommended to friends and family</li>
    <li> Really does help block odor and sweating on a daily basis. The family member that uses it noticed it did not work so well when exercising though.</li>
    <li> Sucks, didn&#x27;t work at all for me</li>
    <li> Used this for about two weeks.  First of all, it barely reduced the problem.  I understand sweat is a biological thing and not all products are going to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is inexcusable is the stains it has left on my shirts.  I followed the instructions on the package, and even let the pits \\&quot;dry\\&quot; much longer than the described 15 seconds.  Doesn&#x27;t matter - I&#x27;m now out several shirts even after multiple washing and soaks in oxy-clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this product under and circumstances.  Damaging my clothes is the last thing I want from my antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with hyperhidrosis since I was 13. I&#x27;ve tried many products that worked for a few months then quit working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Klima Antiperspirant for about two months now. The first use I was 100% sweat free. But before I went shopping for clothes that weren&#x27;t black for once, I wanted to give it a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first week, my puddles came back. Doing it once every 5 days isn&#x27;t an option. And even using it once (sometimes twice-three times) a day, I still have sweat marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried teaming Klima Antiperspirant with other antiperspirants but no luck. I seem to sweat more if I add other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the tip about using a blow dryer to dry it. Still, I have sweat marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t consider myself to have EXCESSIVE hyperhidrosis. I do get large puddles, but they are hidden if I keep my arm down. I&#x27;m really disappointed Klima doesn&#x27;t work for me either. I&#x27;ve tried many different ways, and nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have mild hyperhidrosis, it&#x27;s possible this product would work for you. But if you have puddles that take over your entire underarm, this product will just make that puddle a little smaller.</li>
    <li> does not work as well as I thought.</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s my own fault for trusting - but I would like to have seen a prominent part of the description featuring the fact that this is an aluminum-based antiperspirant, not cactus-based.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caused severe allergic itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware!</li>
    <li> Been using for 2 years and I promise you its the only way,&lt;br /&gt;burn lasts maybe 15 min goes away after a couple of uses&lt;br /&gt;man up! and use this if you want to wear gray on a hot day again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for 2 years after trying tons of others and getting no results. I began to really notice my Axillary Hyperhidrosis at 18 and hated it and spent ages trying everything to get rid of it. I was very depressed to have this condition and I constantly had to look for clothes that would make it less noticeable. I researched many options even considered surgery because I was determined I wasn&#x27;t going to live with this problem&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I discovered this and it changed everything. Really have to follow the directions, I would wait a good hour after showering to put it on other wise yeah it will hurt a bit. Always do it at night before bed 3-4 sprays. It is going to hurt the first few times but don&#x27;t touch it, I just took a few melatonin to try and fall asleep as fast as possible after. This will wear off after the second week, just man up its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now 2 years later I use it every 3 days and it is still working. Your probably going to need a new bottle every month or so but its still way cheaper and less risky than surgery, which I honestly believe is the only other option. I live in the heat of south florida and I can wear a gray shirt without getting huge sweat patches, wouldn&#x27;t ever be saying that with out this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2015&lt;br /&gt;Still the best product ever made</li>
    <li> Works really good, kept me dry and without odor for 3 to 4 days! Would definetly recommend it. Love it</li>
    <li> okay guys - let me start by saying i never write up product reviews, in fact this is literally my first ever review. this product has inspired me to write my first review simply through how effective it is. for years i had excessive perspiration and couldn&#x27;t find a way to cure it. i tried every deodorant under the sun with no luck. in fact, purchasing klima was my last attempt at finding a decent antiperspirant before seeing a dermatologist. i&#x27;ve been using klima for the past 5 or so months and i have yet to have a problem with excessive sweating - it&#x27;s gone, cured, zip, done! i couldn&#x27;t be happier. prior to klima i would sweat through everything, even while just sitting at my desk in the dead of winter - super embarrassing stuff - basically, imagine the worst case of armpit sweat you have ever seen and i had was worse, i promise. klima is super strong, worth the price, and better than anything you find for 5 dollars at your grocery store. if you truly have a problem with excess sweating then just splurge a little on klima.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for the first 2-4 weeks it&#x27;s gonna burn when you apply it, it will itch, you will think why would i even do this to myself until you start seeing the results. if it does burn, it&#x27;s because it works - and just suck it up already. also, apply it right after a shower, and to prevent most of the itching and burning just wait until you are completely dry. klima is great, if i could buy in wholesale quantities i would.</li>
    <li> Nothing good to report.</li>
    <li> I have looked for something to prevent excessive sweat in my clothing for years and I finally found this.  It works, plain and simple.</li>
    <li> I put it on around 10-15 minutes after I get out of the shower and my arm pits are dry. I think it really burns/stings. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do I don&#x27;t  really sweat when I wear it. But it really really dries out the skin in my arm pits... like bad. My skin is a bit sensitive though.</li>
