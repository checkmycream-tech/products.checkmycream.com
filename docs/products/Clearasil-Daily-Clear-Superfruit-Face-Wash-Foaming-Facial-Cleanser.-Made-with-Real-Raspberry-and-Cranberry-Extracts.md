      <li>it even worked much better when I used their cream.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Glad</li>

      <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to use this product, thinking it would really help my acne.</li>
      <li>I thought it was working for like 2 days because I wasn&#x27;t getting any new pimples, but sure enough, I started getting more zits like I always do.</li>

      <li>and I break out pretty often.</li>
      <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t really notice any change on my face when I use this before going to sleep.</li>
      <li>really felt the diffrance.</li>
      <li>but I really like the scent.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for my acne.</li>
      <li>This product doesn&#x27;t really make me feel like I have nicer skin when I wake up or after wash.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
      <li>48 hours after using this product my skin is clear!!</li>
      <li>I wake up in the morning with a fresh face and haven&#x27;t had a single breakout since I started using this.  </li>
      <li>I have very oily skin and battle moderate adult acne.  </li>
      <li>As an adult, I have been dealing with \\&quot;adult acne\\&quot; on and off for years.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not certain that this is working any better than the other products I have</li>
      <li>i bought this product after reading the reviews and after having irrataing skin products before i got this in the mail it was really fast shipping to i used it last night thinking itll be the same i woke up this mornng</li>
      <li>I tried other products from the \\&quot;overnight\\&quot; line that seemed to work pretty well.</li>

    <li> Frankly one of my favorite facial cleansers ever surprisingly. It leaves you with a very clean feeling, and does a great way of stripping off all the oil without over drying. I always moisturize afterwards though, so that certainly helps.</li>
    <li> My step-daughter brought this home from college with her and I saw it in the shower and thought I would give it a try.  I am amazed at the results!  It leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh.  I have very oily skin and battle moderate adult acne.  I wake up in the morning with a fresh face and haven&#x27;t had a single breakout since I started using this.  I am hooked!  It lathers nicely and has a nice fresh scent that&#x27;s not mediciny smelling at all.  It has helped my skin tone and clarity and is definitely a new favorite!</li>
    <li> Great product, thank you</li>
    <li> This gets rid of excessive oils and dirt on your face and leaves your face feeling extremely clean. It really dries up your face though. It dispenses the exact amount needed each time which is good and easy to use. It smells clean and minty.</li>
    <li> Do NOT buy this product. I bought this with minor acne, just one or two pimples. When I started using this, my skin severely broke out in the area I was using it.. Almost like a rash looking thing. This made me acne 10x worse, and I am very upset + displeased :(</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really notice any change on my face when I use this before going to sleep. Although I do feel like my face is cleaned and refreshed when I wake up. So I guess it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> I was misled; as a youth I was told that when I grew up my acne would go away.  As an adult, I have been dealing with \\&quot;adult acne\\&quot; on and off for years.  Clearasil Ultra Night Wash actually says on the bottle that redness and the size of pimples will reduce overnight.  They weren&#x27;t kidding! I&#x27;ve been to dermatologists, I&#x27;ve used the most expensive products AND the cheapest products (and EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN).  All I can say is I am blown away.  48 hours after using this product my skin is clear!! I should have taken a picture before I started using this face wash because if you saw my skin today, you wouldn&#x27;t believe me. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> My mom brought this home for me awhile back and i thought it would be one of those typical, commercialized acne products... I was wrong.. Definitely works overnight and does reduce pimple size. I used to get these big red pimple/cyst things on my nose and ever since i started using this wash, I no longer do. Works better than neutrogena etc.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my acne. I used it every night too.</li>
    <li> good product that really helped me. it even worked much better when I used their cream.&lt;br /&gt;I really felt the diffrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not certain that this is working any better than the other products I have but I really like the scent.  My grandson always wants me to wash his face before bed with this because he likes the scent too.</li>
    <li> i bought this product after reading the reviews and after having irrataing skin products before i got this in the mail it was really fast shipping to i used it last night thinking itll be the same i woke up this mornng and my skin look clearer than it ever has and all the redness is gone u have to buy this its so good!(:</li>
    <li> Awesome product - very fast delivery!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks now. I use it every night before I go to sleep, after removing my make up with a remover sheet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is NOT a scrub wash; which I believe works best with acne. I&#x27;m 25 / female and I break out pretty often. And I wear simple make up daily. This product doesn&#x27;t really make me feel like I have nicer skin when I wake up or after wash. But it&#x27;s not a bad product.</li>
    <li> Stinks but works well</li>
    <li> I thought it was working for like 2 days because I wasn&#x27;t getting any new pimples, but sure enough, I started getting more zits like I always do. This wash does nothing, and it smells bad. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> I used it for my face and i got a red hurting skin. My hsuband used it two and he had no problems. The result was good on his face. No pimples after two or more applications.</li>
    <li> The store was out of my usual face wash so I decided to give this a shot.  Glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump makes it easy to use and you don&#x27;t need very much for it to be effective.  Just put a small dab in your hands and rub until it gets foamy.  I love the way it smells and how it makes my face feel afterwards (soft and smooth!).  I have super sensitive skin and this hasn&#x27;t irritated it or anything.  I&#x27;ve also had acne my entire life and this has kept it under control (but it doesn&#x27;t totally prevent breakouts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this from now on.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and was the exact product I needed</li>
    <li> I am in my late 40&#x27;s and feel like I have tried every product out there.  I noticed overnight that my redness and faded, healing had occured and my pores looked smaller.  I think that I have found a keeper.</li>
    <li> I was excited to use this product, thinking it would really help my acne. I tried other products from the \\&quot;overnight\\&quot; line that seemed to work pretty well. Unfortunately, this wash did not give me any results. I did not see a difference in pimple size or any improvement in my skin. I won&#x27;t repurchase this product. I found washes with benzoyl peroxide to be more effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now and I find that it works well with my skin. I don&#x27;t have a lot of acne, just an occasional break out every now and then. This product does seem to make skin clearer, at least compared so some other products I&#x27;ve used in the past. However, I have found that I can only use this product once every day or two because it dries out my skin pretty bad.</li>
