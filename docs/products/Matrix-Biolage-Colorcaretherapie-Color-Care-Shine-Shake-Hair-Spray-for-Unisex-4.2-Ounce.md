      <li>I just wish it was more of a &amp;#34;dry hair&#x27; spray, but the directions tell you to spray it into damp hair (which is what the Shine Milk is for), so using both at the same time seems way too redundant.</li>
      <li>This really keeps the frizzies down, and make my hair so soft and shiny!  </li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t read barely any of the words on the bottle..</li>
