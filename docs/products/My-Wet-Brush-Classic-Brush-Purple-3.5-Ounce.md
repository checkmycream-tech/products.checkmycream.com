      <li>This brush really does work magic.  </li>
      <li>Nice for wet hair and fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Its the only kind of brush we use now.</li>
      <li>This is nothing more than a regular cheap brush.</li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t really anything special about this brush.</li>
      <li>This has to be one of the best brushes that I have ever found to brush through my curly hair both wet and dry.</li>
      <li>This is the first brush that she does not complain about me pulling her hair when I am brushing it.  </li>
      <li>hair dye stained the pretty purple</li>
      <li>I detangle first using the tangle tamer and use this to pick up the shedded hairs.</li>
      <li>My daughter doesn&#x27;t complain as much when I use this on her hair and it seems to work better overall.</li>
      <li>Now the knots are painless, and they come out much more easily than with past brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>We have said goodbye to tangles in our home.&lt;br /&gt;Using this brush has pretty much eliminated the use of our wide-tooth comb for combing out tangles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have pretty long hair and gets tangled easily, when using this brush it de-tangles my hair without hurting me.</li>
      <li>also used it on my dry hair and love it just as much.</li>
      <li>Untangles hair after showering really well.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>They payed around twice as much buying the brush at a salon.</li>
      <li>I would recommend to anyone who wants to detangle their hair without hurting them.</li>
      <li>so much cheaper....</li>
      <li>Our daughter has really curly hair.  </li>
      <li>Made my daughter&#x27;s hair brushing much easier.</li>
      <li>but it does seam to work better getting the tangles out beter than other brushes we have had.</li>
      <li>Has been able to keep up with my rough brushing and hasn&#x27;t fallen apart yet!</li>
      <li>She likes the brush better than any other brush she has had.</li>
      <li>The hair breakage has been very minimal and it makes brushing my hair extremely easy even when my hair is very knotty.  </li>
      <li>think even the shedding has been reduced significantly using this brush, which says a lot considering we have three girls with long hair.</li>
      <li>My daughter has fine, thin hair, that easily gets tangled.</li>
      <li>WOW, what a difference!  </li>
      <li>Soft brush and does not hurt the scalps when comb.</li>
      <li>My 5 year old daughter has a lot of hair and it tends to get tangled.  </li>
      <li>even went to a professional hair salon and the stylist was using this brush!&lt;br /&gt;Bought it in purple</li>
      <li>They are gentle enough for even the smallest kids.</li>
      <li>I will purchase again when this one gets too old.</li>
      <li>This is the only one that really works.  </li>
      <li>wet hair- fresh out of the tub.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine hair and my hair dressing told me that I need to get a brush made for wet brushing if I wanted to keep from destroying my hair anymore than I had been already...</li>
      <li>Since I bought &amp;#34;The wet brush&amp;#34; she fell in love with it and use it every day, even few times a day.</li>
      <li>;  I also bought one for my 12 year old granddaughter who also has long hair.</li>

    <li> Nowhere near as good as the Tangle Teaser or the Knot Genie. Get one of those. This is nothing more than a regular cheap brush.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and my hair dressing told me that I need to get a brush made for wet brushing if I wanted to keep from destroying my hair anymore than I had been already... So, I bought this and let me tell you WOW, what a difference!  The hair breakage has been very minimal and it makes brushing my hair extremely easy even when my hair is very knotty.  Has been able to keep up with my rough brushing and hasn&#x27;t fallen apart yet!</li>
    <li> Great for knotted hair.  Its the only kind of brush we use now.</li>
    <li> I bought this Wet Brush for my 7 year old granddaughter who disliked brushing the numerous tangles out of her long hair. When I gave her this brush she used it and said&amp;#34; thank you, grandma, this is the best brush ever!&amp;#34;  I also bought one for my 12 year old granddaughter who also has long hair. The word she used to describe the brush was &amp;#34;Awesome!&amp;#34; This brush definitely takes the &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; out of hair brushing! I definitely recommend this brush!</li>
    <li> This brush really does work magic.  Our daughter has really curly hair.  This brush doesn&#x27;t hurt her after her bath or shower.  It also provides body to her hair and helps us keep her happy while styling her hair.  I&#x27;d recommend it to everyone.</li>

    <li> AMAZEBALLS. MY CHILD WILL NOW BRUSH HER OWN HAIR.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my granddaughter. She is four and has long thick hair. Now fixing her hair is drama free. I am going to order extras.</li>
    <li> Using a cousin&#x27;s version, our toddler daughter was amazed she could brush her own, wet hair- fresh out of the tub.  This one arrived quickly and has performed flawlessly for the past month or so we&#x27;ve had it.  A must-have for children with long hair.</li>
    <li> I have tried many combs and brushes on my girls&#x27; hair.  This is the only one that really works.  They don&#x27;t complain anymore when I have to brush out the knots.</li>
    <li> omg omg I was skeptical but I could not be happier with this brush. it is amazing. my hair is prone to tangles and this brush detangles with ease and without pain. I recently bought a paddle brush and it randomly melted so I got this as a replacement and not I want one for my gym bag. Get it it works. M&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair dye stained the pretty purple so I will probably get a darker color next time.</li>
    <li> Best item I&#x27;ve ever purchased! Great quality for the price- totally recommend for children and adults with delicate/ fine hair.</li>
    <li> This works fine. Not sure why everyone is raving.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t really anything special about this brush. It just looks and performs as any ordinary brush would. We have had it for 4 months and it is already starting to fall apart</li>
    <li> MY daughter used to hate to have her hair brushed.  She is fine with it now.  This is a great brush.  I will purchase again when this one gets too old.</li>
    <li> I had already bought this brand before and fell in love with it. I have pretty long hair and gets tangled easily, when using this brush it de-tangles my hair without hurting me. Great brush I would recommend to anyone who wants to detangle their hair without hurting them.</li>

    <li> The Wet Brush has changed my life! I used to hate brushing my hair because it is long (down to my butt) and the knots would be painful to brush out. Now the knots are painless, and they come out much more easily than with past brushes I&#x27;ve used. Some of my friends and family disagree with me on this brush, but I personally love it!</li>
    <li> I use it not first time in salon! Very satisfied! Very easy detangle hair! Recommend!</li>
    <li> Soft brush and does not hurt the scalps when comb. Great hair brush !</li>
    <li> Favorite brush on earth!</li>
    <li> Worked great on a 5 year old with long curly hair who hated having her hair brushed. She will even brush it by herself with this brush! Used it on my on hair and suprised how easily it removes tangles. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> We have said goodbye to tangles in our home.&lt;br /&gt;Using this brush has pretty much eliminated the use of our wide-tooth comb for combing out tangles.&lt;br /&gt;I think even the shedding has been reduced significantly using this brush, which says a lot considering we have three girls with long hair.</li>
    <li> Seems to be the best brush for the money. Feels nice on head and doesn&#x27;t rip hair out.</li>
    <li> I have had friends rave about the wet brush, and wanted to purchase one. They payed around twice as much buying the brush at a salon. I liked the price and ordered it. My daughter has fine, thin hair, that easily gets tangled. She used to cry at the thought of me brushing out her hair before. Once we started to use this brush, I realized, i wish i had this a long time ago! It worked well in her dry hair too. I don&#x27;t know what it is, but when she brushes her hair it looks silky. I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I detangle first using the tangle tamer and use this to pick up the shedded hairs. Love love love love!</li>
    <li> Only thing that can brush through my hair!&lt;br /&gt;I even went to a professional hair salon and the stylist was using this brush!&lt;br /&gt;Bought it in purple, I usually put conditioner on the brush when I brush it in the shower,&lt;br /&gt;Ive also used it on my dry hair and love it just as much.</li>
    <li> These products were delivered on time and are wonderful. Great product that I would highly recommend. Are using them my wife was very satisfied with their performance.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my twelve year old daughter that has very thick long hair  that tangles realy bad. She likes the brush better than any other brush she has had. it does not do anything magic or anything like that but it does seam to work better getting the tangles out beter than other brushes we have had. We still have to work at getting the tangles out . im not like some of the reviews that make you think the tangles just fall out when the brush touches your hair because they don&#x27;t.I do like the brush and she wants the small one to carry in her book bag.</li>
    <li> everybody loves this brush. easy on tangles.</li>
    <li> best detangling brush out there. I absolutely love these brushes and my daughter is in heaven. no more screaming when i brush</li>
    <li> I have thick Italian hair....to keep this short my girl at the salon uses this, got it Here so much cheaper....bought four more for sisters and friends! I don&#x27;t even feel like I&#x27;m brushing my long hair anymore! It&#x27;s a must get! Love it</li>
    <li> The Brush is very good quality. Untangles hair after showering really well. The bristles are sturdy and the handle is comfortably made. Made my daughter&#x27;s hair brushing much easier.</li>
    <li> This has to be one of the best brushes that I have ever found to brush through my curly hair both wet and dry. They are gentle enough for even the smallest kids. I bought tons of these as Christmas gifts this year. :)</li>
    <li> Love this brush!  My 5 year old daughter has a lot of hair and it tends to get tangled.  This is the first brush that she does not complain about me pulling her hair when I am brushing it.  We love this brush!</li>
    <li> Great brush - love it.  Nice for wet hair and fine hair.  But they don&#x27;t send the color you ask for.</li>
