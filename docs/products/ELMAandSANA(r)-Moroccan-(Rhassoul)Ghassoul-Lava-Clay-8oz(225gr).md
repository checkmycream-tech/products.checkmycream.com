      <li>The different clays from Costa Rica that I tried were good and did their job, but it took longer.</li>
      <li>Overall my skin looked good.</li>
      <li>I left on for about 15 minutes and within 2 or 3 days I noticed a nice smooth complexion tone.</li>
      <li>My natural hair is hooked on this stuff :-)</li>
      <li>If you read the directions on the container it says to have fun with the mixture and boy do I plan on doing just that.  </li>
      <li>I use this clay mixed with rose water and sandalwood powder for a face mask.  </li>
      <li>but the results are worth it.</li>
      <li>Once I mixed the Lava Clay with the Pure Rose Water and Olive Oil, it made a mud-like texture.</li>
      <li>I purchased this Moroccan&lt;br /&gt;Rhassoul Lava clay and Pure Rose Water to deep condition my hair.</li>
      <li>I had a beautiful skin through my teen years, and then I started to get zits when I became a young adult</li>

      <li>When my supply runs out, I&#x27;ll definitely buy more.</li>
      <li>I first heard about Rhassoul from Naptural85 on youtube.  </li>
      <li>All I can say is: Wow!!!!</li>
      <li>When I use it, I definitely notice my curls clumping more readily.  </li>
      <li>not leaving you feeling dry and scratchy like so many soap products.</li>
      <li>Like some bentonite masks, you can really feel this tightening on your skin as it dries.  </li>
      <li>I have seen fantastic results with regular water.</li>
      <li>This clay is working miracles even with the marks that I was getting with these new zits.</li>
      <li>No big deal, didn&#x27;t really see that much improvement in terms of clarity and tone.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;So if you have very sensitive skin as I do, caution.</li>
      <li>My hair was soft, supple and tangle-free like I have never seen in my 44 years on earth!  </li>
      <li>I got back a skin without zits, but I still got some pores that remained a little bit more open than others and that showed that once there was a zit right in that spot.</li>
      <li>All the way down to my new growth, natural hair) about two weeks after this original post.</li>
      <li>Now I just hav to get a natural hair dye.lol</li>

      <li>It leave my hair so soft.  </li>
      <li>have sensitive skin and this does not irritate it or cause me to breakout.</li>
      <li>If I make too much, I just put a lid on the container until next time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m Am African-American woman who is on a Natural Hair Journey, since October 2012.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a great product for your skin as well as your hair. I have read about this product for women with natural hair. I use this once a week on my face as well as my hair. I have noticed that my face is clearing up very nicely.</li>
    <li> Made my face break out</li>
    <li> I had a beautiful skin through my teen years, and then I started to get zits when I became a young adult--I was 20 when the infamous zits started to come up. At that time I was living in Costa Rica, and after reading a book on clays that my dad gave me, I started using red clay for my face. Suddenly all the zits were no more...I got back a skin without zits, but I still got some pores that remained a little bit more open than others and that showed that once there was a zit right in that spot. Overall my skin looked good. Now in my 40s, I guess my body is going bananas again with lots of changes,  and it is zit time again. Since I am not in Costa Rica anymore I started looking at Amazon for some sort of clay for my face because that formula of using clay worked once. This ELMA&amp;SANA clay is out of this world--I know, I know...it is Moroccan--but the way in which it works on your face is something that I have never experienced before. The different clays from Costa Rica that I tried were good and did their job, but it took longer. This clay is working miracles even with the marks that I was getting with these new zits. It is extracting all the impurities, closing the open pores, and also clearing my skin--those marks from my new zits are going away--and all of this is happening in a short period of time. I have been using the clay with destilled water for three weeks, and I love how my skin looks. I simply love it, and I am planning on keeping this product around. Oh, and the price is unbeatable. Love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Good price, product is high quality.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after reading many reviews on here.  I bought SheaTerra Organics Rose Water and I mix it with the clay to make a wonderful mask that gives life to my face.  I haven&#x27;t used it on my hair yet.</li>
    <li> I like this clay I use it for a facial as well as washing my kinky curly natural hair, my hair was so soft after the wash I couldnt believe it .</li>
    <li> I use this clay mixed with rose water and sandalwood powder for a face mask.  After I use it, I can definitely see a difference in the texture of my skin.  My pores definitely look smaller.  It also makes my skin feel clean.  Like some bentonite masks, you can really feel this tightening on your skin as it dries.  I also add this into my Ayurvedic powder concoction that I use on my naturally curly hair about once a month.  When I use it, I definitely notice my curls clumping more readily.  When my supply runs out, I&#x27;ll definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive and didn&#x27;t do well with this product</li>
    <li> This mask is incredible.  I have sensitive combination skin and this mask does everything I want it to.  I mix it with regular water and put it on my face, neck, shoulders, back and chest.  It clears my pores and leaves my skin with a fresh firm feeling.  I do recommend applying with a brush.  I use a foundation brush to put it on.  If I make too much, I just put a lid on the container until next time.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate it or cause me to breakout.</li>
    <li> Its okay nothing to write about it.  I added a little oil with it to make the paste but it still stung my face a little as it was drying.  No big deal, didn&#x27;t really see that much improvement in terms of clarity and tone.  I don&#x27;t have much acne, however, there are plenty of  OTC facial mask products that have brightened and smoothed my face for less money.  Instead of throwing it away, I now add it to my soaking baths as a detox with sea salts and used as a hair mask.  As a hair mask, it gave my hair a little body but again for the money... not likely to purchase from amazon again.  I will get the clay cheaper else where especially for the small amount you get.</li>
    <li> Love, love love this Rhassoul especially mixed with rose water. Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I heard that Moroccan&#x27;s have the best beauty secrets. One of them was that women use Ghassoul lava clay. I looked for the best quality and reasonably priced product on amazon and after thorough analysis, I found that this product was the best buy. I was not disappointed. I like to use this whenever my face starts to look dull with old skin or flaking. I radiate immediately. Love it.</li>
    <li> I love to mix this with lemon juice to get a mouse consistency. Very good facial mask. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 2013 Update:&lt;br /&gt;My new mask with this clay is mixing it with apple cider vinegar in the warm months to get rid of blackheads. You can feel it working.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff people. A very natural way to have amazing skin. Yes the application can be messy....it&#x27;s clay but the results are worth it. I mix mine with rose water or distilled water to clean my skin. You can create a mask this way or just use it as a wash. I recommend researching uses and mixtures to get some of your own ideas. Haven&#x27;t used it for my hair yet.</li>
    <li> not really sure what i was expecting anymore but it works fine nothing special about it.</li>
    <li> I love clay masks! They are so easy to mix and use. I do not have rosewater as the direction suggest might be good. I have seen fantastic results with regular water. I leave it on for 15 minutes and get clean, exfoliated, tighter skin.</li>
    <li> I tried naptural85 recipe for mudwash, my hair love this!  It leave my hair so soft.  This is a keeper.  Maybe I&#x27;ll try it on my face.</li>
    <li> Is an excellent product. My wife use it and i couldn&#x27;t scape from that experience... The best option for a clean skin!</li>
    <li> Amazng clay just mix it with rose water and you will like the result</li>
    <li> Just mix a small quantity of the powder, smear over face. I swear you can feel it sucking the toxins out of your skin. Wash off and I am convinced my skin is clearer, lines are finer.</li>
    <li> My skin showed some big improvement with brightening the skin tone. I trusted this natural product. I will buy more.</li>
    <li> This product is great for clearing up blemishes and spots. Make sure you do not frown or make sad faces while the product is on, as it will leave lines for a while after the treatment has been done. I left on for about 15 minutes and within 2 or 3 days I noticed a nice smooth complexion tone. Great for those with acne.</li>
    <li> Very good product for skin and hair. Skin feels smooth and relaxed after a mask. Just wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it as a shampoo: mix it with a few drops of Argan oil, water and a little apple cider vinegar for shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans the hair very well and it feels fuller.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy.</li>
    <li> I made a hair paste with this...with a little water and apple cider vinegar and I use it to wash my hair every other day...my hair stylist said my hair feels thicker, more volumptous . I will probably regularly be buying this so I wish it was cheaper</li>
    <li> I used it as a mask for my hair and its great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Am African-American woman who is on a Natural Hair Journey, since October 2012. I purchased this Moroccan&lt;br /&gt;Rhassoul Lava clay and Pure Rose Water to deep condition my hair. I am Transitioning from permed hair to my natural hair. In learning that our hair requires much more than a shampoo and conditioner. Once I mixed the Lava Clay with the Pure Rose Water and Olive Oil, it made a mud-like texture. I applied it to my hair, sat under the dryer for one hour and then rinsed it out. All I can say is: Wow!!!! My hair fell in love! My hair was soft, supple and tangle-free like I have never seen in my 44 years on earth!  I have been using this product once a week ever since. This past weekend, I ran out!!!!!!! So I used a Tea Tree conditioner mixed with Pure Coconut Oil as a deep conditioner...&lt;br /&gt;Wrong!! My hair was livid! It wouldn&#x27;t respond to anything. It was  very tangled, dry, and depressed!!  Lol !!! I will NEVER allow myself to run out of this stuff, it would be too traumatizing to my hair!  Next up, I will try this Lava Clay for a facil cleanser, I KNOW my face will love it!!! There is something about the feel of an EARTHY texture against your skin, that, for me, it&#x27;s amazing!!!  But hey, as a little girl, a always LOVED playing in mud, and making Mud Pies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;04/21/13&lt;br /&gt;Still in love with this stuff!!! I did try using it for a facial, and it was great! Left my skin feeling very soft and  supple.&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, I did the Big Chop ( cut all my permed hair off. All the way down to my new growth, natural hair) about two weeks after this original post. My natural hair is hooked on this stuff :-)</li>
    <li> It burned? Maybe I did something wrong? Kind of afraid to use it again though.</li>
    <li> A must have if you love your hair and skin.  Excellent Product.  Will never be without it from now on.</li>
    <li> This is the second type of cleansing mud/clay I tried.&lt;br /&gt;Both left big dissappointment. Both irritates my sensitive skin around the mouth area a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I read that you can mix this with milk or toner and keep massaging and it deep cleans your face,&lt;br /&gt;but i am not willing to give it another try as I dont want to risk again.&lt;br /&gt;So if you have very sensitive skin as I do, caution.</li>
    <li> Clay is a natural derivative  of the earth and most are kind to your body granted there are no harmful additives. This clay is great on the hair or body.  The mud is very kind to scalp and skin not leaving you feeling dry and scratchy like so many soap products. I will be stocking up.</li>
    <li> Love this for my skin!  I use about 2X a week and my skin is a lot smoother and I&#x27;m breaking out less.</li>
    <li> I first heard about Rhassoul from Naptural85 on youtube.  See she has been washing her hair with a clay shampoo and a company asked her to try out the Rhassoul clay.  She loved it so I thought I would give it a try.  Well, all I can say is that it cleaned my hair just like shampoo, but my hair was less frizzy.  I am going to continue to use this product and see how my hair will look, let say after a month or two.  I will have to come back and give an update.  I mixed my product with water, but next time I will put a little olive oil in the mixture and see how well that works.  If you read the directions on the container it says to have fun with the mixture and boy do I plan on doing just that.  So far I can&#x27;t see myself using anymore shampoos on my hair.  I am going natural all the way.  Now I just hav to get a natural hair dye.lol</li>
    <li> Im originally from morocco, I use to using when I was a kid not on my face but for my hair. but this one is good for both, I would recomened for any one any type a skin too.</li>
