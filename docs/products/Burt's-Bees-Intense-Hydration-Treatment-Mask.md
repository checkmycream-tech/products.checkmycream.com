      <li>You&#x27;ll be like me and order more.</li>
      <li>This facial mask is awesome</li>
      <li>More during the winter months.</li>
      <li>;  I&#x27;ve tried several hydration masks but this one gave me the best results.</li>
      <li>Not bad product but kind of oily.</li>
      <li>This is perfect for anyone with dry skin.</li>
      <li>This mask makes my face really soft, great for winter.</li>
      <li>I love how easily it smoothes on my skin and smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>but this is by far on the top of my list!!</li>
      <li>It feels great to first exfoliate and then apply this silky cream to my clean, fresh skin.  </li>
      <li>It is ultra hydrating and vanishes fine lines.</li>
      <li>I started noticing fine lines as the winter has gone on</li>
      <li>BzzAgents are not associated with Burt&#x27;s Bees and are under an obligation to write honest reviews, whether positive or negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This cream is an amazing moisturizer at a perfectly reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product.</li>
      <li>This is a great mask, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>My skin felt extremely smooth and the flakes disappeared.</li>
      <li>I chose this one kind of on a whim, and I really like it.</li>
      <li>The skin looked smooth and taught.  </li>
      <li>I had the opportunity to test this product for free (I&#x27;m a BzzAgent), and I liked it so much I decided to review it here as well.</li>
      <li>The mask is not sticky or greasy and the scent is light and pleasant, reminiscent of honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was so excited about this product - hoping it would be a hydrating moisture rich mask.</li>
      <li>have also noticed that not only does the mask successfully hydrate my skin with each application</li>
      <li>I really love how much moisture my skin retains over night!  </li>
      <li>I have dealt with acne and sensitive skin for more years than I care to count and have tried so many face products</li>
      <li>I bought this because of the great reviews and because I have very dry skin.</li>
      <li>I love it so much.</li>
      <li>I also use the night cream, cleanser and eye cream in the Intense Hydration line and love them all.  </li>
      <li>I like to use a soft wash cloth and warm water to remove excess and massage it in.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed the feeling of my skin right after a hot shower</li>
      <li>Otherwise, nice clean smell, white in color (</li>
      <li>I put it on and felt like my face was cleaned for the first time!</li>
      <li>This would be good for so,wine with very dry skin or for winter time.</li>
      <li>it left my face feeling kind of sticky.</li>
      <li>I could use it a couple times a week to keep my skin pampered and my makeup looking fresh.</li>
      <li>So I turned to a more natural solution a couple of years ago.</li>
      <li>This is not a traditional style mask, but it does a great job at hydrating my 48 year old skin,</li>
      <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>The packaging is simple and convenient, the product goes on smooth and easy, and the results are achieved quickly.</li>
      <li>The scent was very relaxing and the product itself was rich, dense, and creamy.  </li>
      <li>and I do this right before bed</li>
      <li>and I found this lotion in the fall and it kept my skin nice all winter long.</li>
      <li>I also was impressed that the new tube came sealed with foil, so you are guaranteed to have fresh and wet cream when you open it</li>
      <li>After 10 minutes most of cream was absorbed by the skin and what was left</li>
      <li>Truly a gentle and effective mask that I continue buying and using regularly.</li>
      <li>Folks, this will give your face a good, deep, moisturizing like nothing I&#x27;ve ever tried before!&lt;br /&gt;Follow the directions, but I&#x27;ve left it on overnight more than once and woken with soft, well hydrated skin.  </li>
      <li>I do agree with a few other reviewers that after you&#x27;ve left it on for 10-30 minutes, best to dab off any remaining mask with a warm wash cloth.</li>
      <li>It leaves behind a light, pleasant scent and just the right amount of moisture.</li>
      <li>Firstly, let me say that I got this product at no cost from BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will definitely buy again :)</li>
      <li>Patch test first.</li>
      <li>I like to use it at night after a hot shower.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was first introduced to this mask through BzzAgent, and was sent a full-size sample to try and review.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m pretty psyched about that.</li>
      <li>But my love was ill-fated, this mask left a wax film on my face</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Choose to give to a friend as a gift to add to his Birthday Basket. He loved it and will continue to buy more .</li>
    <li> Leaves skin very soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> This cream is an amazing moisturizer at a perfectly reasonable price. I have been using it after microdermasion, and it&#x27;s been so quenching for my face. Avoid paying for over-priced facial moisturizers, you get a lot of bang for your buck from this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Feels amazing on your skin but made me break out. Patch test first.</li>
    <li> I see a visible difference in my skin using these products.  The mask is ultra-hydrating and feels like a spa treatment for my face.  It feels great to first exfoliate and then apply this silky cream to my clean, fresh skin.  I have never been one to pay a lot for facial products; I decided to try these because they are natural and were highly recommended.  I have not been disappointed and would recommend these low-ingredient-count products over others I have seen on the market.  Give it a shot!</li>
    <li> Love Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin, so I have not left this on as a mask. I used a dab and applied to my face like moisturizer after cleansing, and wiped off excess with a cotton ball. Even with that minimal application, my face immediately felt super soft.</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT - I WEAR TO BED - DOES KEEP FACE FROM MOVING!!  NO FUNNY FACES WHILE YOU SLEEP.  I WOULD BUY AGAIN - BUT THERE ARE BETTER PRODUCTS.</li>
    <li> I use it not very often. but it feels nice.</li>
    <li> I really love how much moisture my skin retains over night!  Most times I don&#x27;t even blot it off.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great--extremely affordable but feels and works like a more expensive product.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin so I am very particular about what to use on my face ,so when I read this products review I thought to give it a try ,and guess what this is amazing</li>
    <li> I was so excited about this product - hoping it would be a hydrating moisture rich mask. Unfortunately it is the consistency of Dove lotion for the face. Very hard to get enough on your face to even feel like it is there. There is nothing mask-like or even night cream resemblant about it. Sad because I love BB products!</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and this mask treatment really kept my skin hydrated. I&#x27;ve tried plenty of other brands and products before, but nothing works like this.</li>
    <li> Product is great.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon need to improve the shipping package.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for anyone with dry skin. It is ultra hydrating and vanishes fine lines. I use the entire clary sage line.</li>
    <li> Noticeable difference after the first use - this winter has been brutal in Michigan, and my skin has been super dry (even with a humidifier running almost constantly!), and this really has helped.  I [first wash my face, then] put a thinnish-medium layer on and let as much absorb as possible for ten minutes then wash it off.  My boyfriend could tell it&#x27;s helping too - he said my face doesn&#x27;t look as tired.</li>
    <li> Product was not properly sealed. Seam of tube was seeping product which puts into question the integrity of the brand and quality of product.</li>
    <li> My skin gets so dry in the winter and I found this lotion in the fall and it kept my skin nice all winter long.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this, I&#x27;ve used so many masks, expensive cleansers, etc - but when your face is dry or just needing a pick me up, this is it. Makes your skin glow!</li>
    <li> Folks, this will give your face a good, deep, moisturizing like nothing I&#x27;ve ever tried before!&lt;br /&gt;Follow the directions, but I&#x27;ve left it on overnight more than once and woken with soft, well hydrated skin.  Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> My face feels like butter and I love it</li>
    <li> I have used this mask this morning. I removed it with Kleenex and I rubbed. It is excellent, the skin is clean, bright and soft. No need of daily cream today. I will use it every week.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin on my face.  I use this treatment mask once a week.  It is extremely moisturizing and my face is very soft and smooth.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Intense Hydration Treatment Mask is my skin savior. I have super dry skin, and frequently suffer from peeling, flaky skin around my \\&quot;T\\&quot; zone (between my eyebrows and around my nostrils, particularly). This mask does what it&#x27;s name promises and provides intense hydration, and leaves my skin feeling softer, smoother, and absent of unsightly flaking. Despite my skin&#x27;s flaws, I am frequently complimented on my complexion. When asked what my secret it, the answer is Burt&#x27;s Bees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also noticed that not only does the mask successfully hydrate my skin with each application, it has also reduced the number of breakouts I experience and reduced the size of my pores. My skin just feels and looks so great afterwards, I can&#x27;t help but write a glowing review for my glowing skin. The mask is easy to apply and takes mere minutes to works its proverbial magic. The mask is not sticky or greasy and the scent is light and pleasant, reminiscent of honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was first introduced to this mask through BzzAgent, and was sent a full-size sample to try and review. I was so impressed that it has since become a permanent fixture in my beauty routine. I typically apply the mask twice a week; sometimes three times during harsh, dry winter months. All I need is a thin application, and this lasts me pretty close to a year. If you suffer from dry skin like I do, this mask is a must.</li>
    <li> One of the best masks I&#x27;ve used. I use it at least once a week! More during the winter months.</li>
    <li> This is not a mask, its a very dense cream, and its not very hydrating. I have very dry skin and this cream doesnt do anything for my skin.</li>
    <li> Hard to find except online, but this product works well on dry skin, used by firnd with severe dry payches and worked great</li>
    <li> I bought this mask because I live in a very dry and cold environment and my skin wasn&#x27;t used to it. I&#x27;ve always liked Burt&#x27;s Bees products and this is no exception. I started noticing fine lines as the winter has gone on and I decided to look into some products. I chose this one kind of on a whim, and I really like it. My skin feels very nice and moisturized. I haven&#x27;t had and weird reactions or breakouts which is great since I have acne prone skin. It hasn&#x27;t helped acne (it doesn&#x27;t claim to) but it hasn&#x27;t made it worse so I&#x27;m happy with that. I like to use it at night after a hot shower. The instructions say to use a thick layer of product and as a skeptic I wondered if that was just a ploy to get you to use more faster and buy more sooner. It really does work better if a thick layer is applied. I do disagree with the instructions to wipe off excess with a tissue and rub it in... it left my face feeling kind of sticky. I like to use a soft wash cloth and warm water to remove excess and massage it in. Otherwise, nice clean smell, white in color (nothing crazy looking that your roommates/loved ones will giggle at).</li>
    <li> had an allergic reaction to a skincare product but I am&lt;br /&gt;very allergic to this mask.  My face and neck turned very red&lt;br /&gt;and dry almost immediately.</li>
    <li> This is not a traditional style mask, but it does a great job at hydrating my 48 year old skin,</li>
    <li> Purchased as an extra &amp;#34;stocking stuffer&amp;#34; for my granddaughter.  It was on her Amazon &amp;#34;wish-list&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I had serious skin problem, but this little one healed it!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks bur&#x27;s bees. You r my hero! Now my skin looks better , much better!</li>
    <li> it is good ,i love it</li>
    <li> Disappointed this does not live up to positive reviews as far as I am concerned. Didn&#x27;t do much for my skin and my skin is not extremely dry....would not recommend it or buy it again.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s reasonably priced - I feel that it has a &amp;#34;great bang for the buck&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ve tried several hydration masks but this one gave me the best results.</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to test this product for free (I&#x27;m a BzzAgent), and I liked it so much I decided to review it here as well. This is a great mask, especially for the price. It goes on like a thick lotion, you let it sit for ten minutes or so, then wipe off any excess and rub the rest into your skin. I have never done this with a mask before, but the results are great. My skin immediately felt, soft and hydrated. It leaves behind a light, pleasant scent and just the right amount of moisture. I used this mask twice a week for three weeks, and I noticed a definite improvement in my fine lines and wrinkles. I have tried a lot of other beauty products, but this one is a keeper. The packaging is simple and convenient, the product goes on smooth and easy, and the results are achieved quickly. In less than a month&#x27;s time, the horrible onset of my usual winter dry skin has been totally reversed. So I&#x27;m pretty psyched about that.</li>
    <li> I got this because it was recommended on Refinery 29 and I am struggling with winter dry skin.  I have used this mask before bed and before applying make up and love it.  I could use it a couple times a week to keep my skin pampered and my makeup looking fresh.</li>
    <li> I put it on and felt like my face was cleaned for the first time! I hope it is the same for everybody else!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s make my pore look bigger.</li>
    <li> Held it found to be out of date, but amazon is very good to solve my problem .</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the great reviews and because I have very dry skin. After applying the mask as directed and rubbing in any excess into my skin I felt like I hade to wash my face to get the filmy and sticky residue off of my skin. The next morning my skin was even flakier and I broke out.</li>
    <li> Great product and I could tell a difference for the better when I use it a few times a week (brighter, softer skin and I am not a young gal...only young at heart!).  I usually use Burt&#x27;s Intense Hydration Cleanser with it as well, but not always.  I do agree with a few other reviewers that after you&#x27;ve left it on for 10-30 minutes, best to dab off any remaining mask with a warm wash cloth. If I don&#x27;t do that, the little bits left tend to glob up like little sticky beads around your face (best way I know to describe it).  Truly a gentle and effective mask that I continue buying and using regularly.</li>
    <li> So I turned to a more natural solution a couple of years ago. Burt&#x27;s Bees is a great line that makes me feel good about what I&#x27;m using on my body and face; there&#x27;s not of the guilt over wondering if the items were animal-tested (they&#x27;re not) they&#x27;re almost all natural (the bottle will tell you 98.7% pure on one thing and the other ratings on others). As far as masks go, this one is pretty creamy and soft; you wear it for ten-twenty minutes, then wash it off and you feel like your face was just at a spa. It&#x27;s not a hardening masque, so don&#x27;t expect to do that \\&quot;peel\\&quot; thing when using it, but it won&#x27;t clog your pores like cold creme or other products and leaves you feeling smooth, refreshed and naturally clean. And for me, that&#x27;s half the reason I use it: it&#x27;s natural ingredients, it&#x27;s natural feel, and it&#x27;s natural effectiveness. I&#x27;m a fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees items - Their Almond Milk Beeswax Hand Creme is something I swear by and even have the landscaper using it on his hardened and calloused hands now. This is a brand I feel I can trust, and this Mask is something that makes my face look and feel better after just one use. Imagine how it would feel after you&#x27;ve used the whole container up? You&#x27;ll be like me and order more.</li>
    <li> Sorry, but the product makes me itch &amp; burns my face. I won&#x27;t use it again. I am sensitive to products, but I didn&#x27;t think this had anything in it that I would react to: no petroleum products, lanolin, etc....</li>
    <li> I purchased it following Dr. Jessica Wu&#x27;s newsletter letter. But I don&#x27;t feel anything good or bad about it. I will continue to finish it but won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
    <li> Very good product and delivered to me very quickly.</li>
    <li> This mask makes my face really soft, great for winter. Not too greasy but I use it before showering.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. My skin absorbs it immediately so I leave it on for the night. My skin feels hydrated and soft. It&#x27;s one of my favorite products. Plus it&#x27;s 99% natural. A Must have for dry skin!</li>
    <li> I didnt experience any hydration benefits from this</li>
    <li> I like all the ingredients and I&#x27;m a fan of the company so I was optimistic when purchasing this in addition to the intense hydration cleanser. But my love was ill-fated, this mask left a wax film on my face and I still felt dry and stiff. It did leave my skin very matte and I liked the smell but when I started to break out and a few blackheads appeared the balance was tipped decisively and both products will be sent back.</li>
    <li> Sometimes my skin just needs an extra boost. Or feels very dry after using a more drying treatment mask. This fits the bill for both of those situations. I have tried other brands such as Origins and cheaper brands--this one beats them all. I love how easily it smoothes on my skin and smells fantastic. It moisturizes in a short amount of time and I like that I can rub in the excess for a little extra moisture. My skin felt extremely smooth and the flakes disappeared. I highly recommend this to give your skin that extra moisture boost.</li>
    <li> The shopping experience makes me really happy, this thing is really great, just in time for the United States of promotional activities, the price is great, my family and I are very fond of it, I hope the next Amazon has more benefits to me, next time I will come!</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizing mask I have used in years. It does not break out my extremely sensitive skin, nor is there an overpowering smell. The price is right, it is almost completely natural, and my skin thanks Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
    <li> I have a combination skin (with oily T zone) and rest areas very dry and this mask is for the dry areas of my face such as cheeks, chin, around the cheeks etc (while for T-zone, i use a clay mask).&lt;br /&gt;This is specially formulated for sensitive skin as i did not break out and it did quench the dryness of my face and made my skin shinny but in a healthy way.&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a once a week treat for my skin.</li>
    <li> There are small particles in it.Is water.my face very moist after used it.I Will buy again next time.I love it so much.</li>
    <li> Not bad product but kind of oily. This would be good for so,wine with very dry skin or for winter time.</li>
    <li> great product for the money</li>
    <li> It dries my skin a little bit if I use twice to wash my face.</li>
    <li> This facial mask is awesome I tried it for the first time last night and was very surprised. I will definitely buy again :)</li>
    <li> Smells intense. Feels waxy and not refreshing. Didn&#x27;t do much for me. Don&#x27;t use anymore just sits on counter</li>
    <li> Over the last year I have become more aware of the small lines on my face and became more interested in various moisturizers and hydration creams.  What I look for a cream besides reducing the appearance of wrinkles is pleasant feel and either no scent or light pleasant scent.  Recently I tried Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; Intense Hydration Treatment Mask for the first time.  I applied after a long hot shower to my face and neck.  The intense hydration treatment mask goes on as a cream and stayed wet and pliable for the 10 minutes I left it on.  The cream has a light pleasant scent - reminded me of a clover smell.  After 10 minutes most of cream was absorbed by the skin and what was left I removed with a warm washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin felt very nice right after the application of the mask.  In the morning when I looked in the mirror the tiny wrinkles around my eyes were practically invisible.  The skin looked smooth and taught.  The skin felt softer than normal.  I enjoyed the feeling of my skin right after a hot shower and  it also gave me really nice results in the morning.  The scent was very light and did not keep me from falling asleep (some stronger scents do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the packaging of Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; Treatment Mask. It comes in a tube with a large cap so you store the tube upside down standing on the cap . I am attaching a collage of 2 photos under the customers photos and you see the cap in photo #1. The gravity keeps the cream at the opening and it is easy to get out even when there is just a little bit left.  I also was impressed that the new tube came sealed with foil, so you are guaranteed to have fresh and wet cream when you open it (photo #2).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free tube of Burt&#x27;s Bees treatment mask for evaluation and providing an honest and unbiased review as a BzzAgent. BzzAgents are not associated with Burt&#x27;s Bees and are under an obligation to write honest reviews, whether positive or negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked how Burt&#x27;s Bees mask felt as well as the results it gave me, I plan on continuing to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia reviewas the results it gave me, I plan on continuing to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
    <li> Firstly, let me say that I got this product at no cost from BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BURT&#x27;S BEES® INTENSE HYDRATION Treatment Mask was a product I enjoyed immensely.  I am not really a mask person, because I do not think most of them work as they say they do.  The scent was very relaxing and the product itself was rich, dense, and creamy.  When I removed it, my skin felt plump, dewy, and very comfortable.  I felt similarly about the Treatment Mask as I did the Night Cream - that I would have expected this to be a high-end product.  I would purchase the Treatment Mask in the future.  I give BURT&#x27;S BEES® INTENSE HYDRATION Treatment Mask five stars.</li>
    <li> I love the way that this mask makes your skin feel. I did not expect that it would absorb into your skin. I thought that it would peel off, but you cannot beat the outcome for the price.</li>
    <li> Creamy, does not harden. It says to wipe off, but I use water.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! Would highly recommend especially if you have sensitivities to facial products!! I have dealt with acne and sensitive skin for more years than I care to count and have tried so many face products but this is by far on the top of my list!!</li>
    <li> It is ok, not good and not bad... I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> It is too thick and a bit difficult to spread even. After applying, you would feel a layer of sugary and sticky layer on your face, not really what I am looking for.</li>
    <li> This product did not upset my sensitive skin so I was very happy about it.  I leave it on for about 20 minutes and then remove any residual product and I do this right before bed so it stays moist all night.  It&#x27;s consistency is like that of a cold cream and the smell is light so it should bother sensitive noses.  I would definitely recommend it to my friends!</li>
    <li> I really like it, makes my skin very soft and hydrated.  It&#x27;s a bit gooey and hard to wipe off, so you need to pull your hair back.  I just leave what doesn&#x27;t wipe off on my face and in the morning, my skin if really nice.  I also use the night cream, cleanser and eye cream in the Intense Hydration line and love them all.  I was using Olay Micro Sculpting Cream which I love, but have found the Burt&#x27;s Bees Intense Hydration as listed above and the Radiance Day Cream, my skin is about the same as it was with Olay.  I love using products that are as natural as possible, so I think I&#x27;ll stick with the Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff!  I use it every night!</li>
