### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and I&#x27;m 7 ibs lighter with no dieting, very very happy with thyromine</li>
      <li>This has been an excellent addition.  </li>
      <li>They also have Nori in the combination, which is an excellent seaweed source for minerals and protein, used here for its iodine content.  </li>
      <li>5 stars will come if my doctor gives me good news too!!!</li>
      <li>But seeing as I wasn&#x27;t taking this from a weight loss aspect, I have been very happy with my result.  </li>
      <li>But there is no way I am going to purchase a product when the advertising quite deliberately avoids telling me how many tabs are in each tub !!!  </li>
      <li>but I still wasn&#x27;t feeling very good.</li>
      <li>I gained five pounds in two weeks of taking this stuff, had zero energy, felt incredibly fatigued all the time.</li>
      <li>I am happy</li>
      <li>I love it!!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t felt this good in five years.  </li>
      <li>Good Thyroid Supplement</li>

      <li>It looks a good deal.</li>
      <li>The difference in my energy has been exceptional.  </li>
      <li>Try at your own risk.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been taking this for a month now and to be honest, I can&#x27;t tell a bit of difference.</li>
      <li>So far, it is the best that I&#x27;ve come across for the thyroid \\&quot;searcher.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>love to know.</li>
      <li>I feel better.</li>
      <li>ok</li>
      <li>I am sleeping through the night on most nights now.</li>
      <li>You can get more than you bargained for and end up \\&quot;confusing\\</li>
      <li>I will update when it gets closer to a month to determine how much better things are.</li>
      <li>(These are two areas of concern for most hypothyroid sufferers.)     </li>
      <li>I look forward to even better results over time as I haven&#x27;t finished 1 bottle yet.</li>
      <li>but I am able to get through my day a lot better.</li>
      <li>and I have a lot more energy.</li>
      <li>and you feel so much better.</li>
      <li>&quot; but I feel much better, taking one in the morning, and one at night.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to losing even more weight.</li>
      <li>AND I DIDN&#x27;T FEEL ANY BETTER WITH THEM</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed some weight loss and more energy, for sure.</li>
      <li>I still sweat quite a bit, but that&#x27;s healthy, so that doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
      <li>Since being on this supplement, I do not feel sluggish, nor do I have many of the bothersome symptoms that go along with that.</li>
      <li>I eliminated the stress in my life by choosing to follow my passion, had more control of my time and no dysfunction in my life.</li>
      <li>and I have tried many things.     </li>
      <li>I have taken it for a month, I feel more energetic and have the desire to want to do things again.</li>
      <li>My clothes fit better and my spirits are better.</li>
      <li>My life has changed and I have not felt this wonderful in a very long time!!</li>
      <li>I feel more energetic and positive.</li>
      <li>I have lost 10 pounds in one month which is huge for me since my metabolic rate tested to be around zero.</li>
      <li>I noticed a huge difference by day two when taking it.</li>
      <li>Product was received with all accurate information.</li>
      <li>Nutritional facts are accurate and up to date</li>
      <li>I decided to try Thyromine after reading mostly great reviews on various sites.    </li>
      <li>I would suggest buying six bottles at once since you will save A LOT of money because this stuff isn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
      <li>i dont enjoy life.</li>
      <li>So far, so good.</li>
      <li>Like many others, I am looking for something that might return my energy levels and my life more towards normal.   </li>
      <li>For now, that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
      <li>Yet, despite those changes, more inner peace and a healthy lifestyle, I still felt sluggish and was overweight.</li>
      <li>However, if you still have your thyroid gland you are among the lucky ones and it is just sluggish, I recommend using Thyromine.  </li>
      <li>Few understand that iodine helps some thyroid patients, but can greatly exacerbate the condition in others, causing sore throat, difficulty swallowing and, eventually goiter.  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t have energy, life really isn&#x27;t much fun at all.</li>
      <li>I tried this after reading many reviews, and wanting to treat my hypothyroid condition naturally.    </li>
      <li>Worth trying I guess though..</li>
      <li>I came across Thyromine on the internet looking for something more natural to use since a thyroid problem will never go away.  </li>
      <li>I seem to be able to handle it much better than I ever did before, as well s extreme heat.     </li>
      <li>I took Synthroid for a while but found that I didn&#x27;t feel right.</li>
      <li>I went for a check up and the Doctor told me the blood tests were normal; I decided to do my own research on natural products that assisst Thyroid problems.</li>
      <li>When I first started taking it</li>
      <li>and I have lost three pounds in the first week.  </li>
      <li>I have just finished the first bottle and have noticed that I have more energy to do things later into the afternoon.  </li>
      <li>I thought, well, it was probably water-weight or something (having tried diet pills in my desperation to lose weight), however, the second weeks I felt even better.  </li>
      <li>have just finished my first bottle</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had a doctor&#x27;s appointment yet to see if my thyroid count has changed, but how I feel overall is much better.  </li>
      <li>Be aware that not all supplements work for everyone.</li>
      <li>I am glad it worked for some people, but I have been off of it for several days now and can&#x27;t tell a difference in the way I felt on or off of it.</li>
      <li>I used to really notice the  thinning at the top of my scalp which is not nearly as noticeable.     </li>
      <li>Below is my original review, after barely finishing a bottle.</li>
      <li>I have now started a new exercise program and am enjoying the extra energy.</li>
      <li>After finishing all six bottles and ordering more, I have to say that this is the first time that I have felt an increase in energy, among other things -</li>
      <li>I was really hoping this was going to help.</li>
      <li>Thyromine has helped me so much.   </li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>Thyromine gently helps with hypothyroid syptems.</li>
      <li>but it can be very benneficial in increasing energy enabling you to lose the weight.</li>
      <li>because I know it really does work.</li>
      <li>have not noticed to much of a difference in weight but</li>
      <li>&quot; other glands that have very important balancing jobs to do in the body.  </li>
      <li>The other changes so far are far more important.</li>
      <li>I have been able to quit taking some of my other supplements without any side effects.</li>
      <li>It seems to be less potent, and it does have \\&quot;fillers\\</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed less aches (for lack of a better way to put it).  </li>
      <li>As the thyroid is such a central part of the body and affects so many things - it just seemed like it made sense to try to correct this situation with a supplement.    </li>
      <li>im currently on a steady dose of 250mcg thyroXine.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend you try it, just for a week to see if it will change your life too.</li>
      <li>My breathing seems a little better too.</li>
      <li>I take one capsule in the afternoon around 2pm when I would normally get sluggish since I take two grains of armour in the morning and one grain around 11am.  </li>
      <li>I would normally give this a 4/5</li>
      <li>i actually get right up and start with my day instead of having this period of trying to come out of the funk I would be in even after sleeping eight hours.</li>
      <li>The first two-three days I didn&#x27;t feel any different,</li>
      <li>In the past I noticed the really good feeling does subside after awhile but the aches and pains and other symptoms do go away.  </li>
      <li>Helped clear up my skin and that&#x27;s about it.  </li>
      <li>My back does not hurt as much</li>
      <li>Wow, i was diagnosed with Graves Disease in 2000.</li>
      <li>I am 53 years old and have been plagued with hypothyroidism for decades.</li>
      <li>For anyone who is plagued with the same problems as I, it could really change your life.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this for a month now and to be honest, I can&#x27;t tell a bit of difference. I was really hoping this was going to help.</li>
    <li> Didnt do anything for me has 1g thyroid med and I need over 100g  Didnt work for me...  Worth trying I guess though..</li>
    <li> I have had to deal with hypothyroid for 17 years after the birth of my son.  I suggested to the women I meet now to include testing their thyroid when having a physical exam.  During the last 5 years I have noticed how Synthroid was just effectively not working for me having to constantly change the dosage.  I came across Thyromine on the internet looking for something more natural to use since a thyroid problem will never go away.  It will only get worst and worst if you don&#x27;t take anything.  Since I have been taking it for 3 years now and have found it to be very helpful in all the bad symptons.  However, if you still have your thyroid gland you are among the lucky ones and it is just sluggish, I recommend using Thyromine.  I do not agree with \\&quot;powership\\&quot; for anything.  I am happy I can now purchase it through Amazon.com whenever I need.  By all means try [[ASIN:B000M2SL9S Thyromine Thyroid Health Support - 1 Month Supply]]</li>
    <li> I have started taking Thyromine again. I took it awhile back and they have since made some changes to the formula- the herbal blend now has a whopping 1302mg rather than just 400mg previously. I take three grains of armour thyroid daily and other vitamins.  This has been an excellent addition.  I take one capsule in the afternoon around 2pm when I would normally get sluggish since I take two grains of armour in the morning and one grain around 11am.  The difference is that after I started taking this i haven&#x27;t been tired upon waking. i actually get right up and start with my day instead of having this period of trying to come out of the funk I would be in even after sleeping eight hours. I am very hard on judging supplements since I have tried them all. In the past I noticed the really good feeling does subside after awhile but the aches and pains and other symptoms do go away.  Give this one a try- I noticed a huge difference by day two when taking it. If it works for you- I would suggest buying six bottles at once since you will save A LOT of money because this stuff isn&#x27;t cheap. It contains 200mg L Tyrosine, 1mg thyroid powder, 1mg of adrenal powder, 1,302 mg of herbal blend- Guglipid, Nori, Ginger, Piper Longum Extract. I would normally give this a 4/5 but a lot of 1 star reviews are not justified since they aren&#x27;t really going into how they felt before or after.</li>
    <li> I have taken this product for a month now, some of the swelling has gone down, my skin tone is no longer yellow.  I have however not lost any weight I am still dieting and exercising, some results say that it could take up to 3 months. I will give it six months before I look for something else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 53 with hypothyroidism. I&#x27;m taking meds. My blood tests continue to show that my thyroid is working ok but I still wasn&#x27;t feeling very good. I was really tired.  I bought Thyromine because of the reviews so I felt I needed to share my review of the product. When I first started taking it I did not feel any change at all. I didn&#x27;t feel better or worse. I continued taking it because I did realize these things take time. Well, I stopped for about 2 weeks. My energy level nose dived. I started taking this supplement again. I take it at 5 a.m. with my meds and I don&#x27;t eat for a few hours. I have energy. Not tons but I am able to get through my day a lot better. This was the only thing I changed so my conclusion is that it is working for me. Be aware that not all supplements work for everyone. They also take time and I didn&#x27;t give it enough time. I would recommend this product. If it doesn&#x27;t work for you it&#x27;s a 26.00 loss; but if it does, you have gained some energy and you feel so much better.</li>
    <li> My life has changed and I have not felt this wonderful in a very long time!! Since using Thyromine my energy level has skyrocketed, my brain fog is gone, and I&#x27;ve lost 15 lbs in 6 weeks!! I have hypothyroidism and was on Synthroid for 15 years. I recently replaced Synthroid with Armour and have incorporated Thyromine into my daily regimen. I&#x27;m looking forward to losing even more weight.</li>
    <li> Took this for 2 months and it works.  I would recommend this product to my friends and family that has low thyroid</li>
    <li> I actually cannot believe that I&#x27;m sitting here writing this review, because a few weeks ago I had so little energy that looking Thyromine up was a huge effort.  Let me start with saying that I bought this product not expecting anything.  I have a thyroid problem, which is being treated-and my tests come back with me being on the border of a low/normal T4 level.  However, I was just barely functioning, and it was affecting every part of my life.  I am 20 pounds overweight, and struggle to keep it that low.  I needed something that would actually work for me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have been taking Thyromine for 2 weeks, and this is my experience with the product.  The first two-three days I didn&#x27;t feel any different, but then I started to notice a little extra bounce in my step.  Then i was sleeping better, my feet weren&#x27;t cold all the time, and I began doing thing like cleaning and walking to things that I didn&#x27;t have the energy to do before.  By the end of the week I had lost 9 pounds.  I thought, well, it was probably water-weight or something (having tried diet pills in my desperation to lose weight), however, the second weeks I felt even better.  I am doing all the things I want to do, and have the energy to take my life back.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  Thyromine has helped me so much.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At the end of two weeks I have lost a total of 17 pounds.  I haven&#x27;t felt this good in five years.  I highly recommend you try it, just for a week to see if it will change your life too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;S~ &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I tried this after reading many reviews, and wanting to treat my hypothyroid condition naturally.    This was a total waste. I didn&#x27;t feel any differently, and it didn&#x27;t help me at all. I can not and will not recommend this.    The company also claims that they have a refund policy; well, no they don&#x27;t. I was run around in circles trying to get my refund, was told you have to wait this long, then you have to do it in this time frame, and so on and so forth. So if it doesn&#x27;t work for you. Don&#x27;t expect to get your money back.</li>
    <li> Below is my original review, after barely finishing a bottle. At that time, I did notice an improvement in my energy level. After finishing all six bottles and ordering more, I have to say that this is the first time that I have felt an increase in energy, among other things - and I have tried many things.     I am 53 years old and have been plagued with hypothyroidism for decades. Nothing I tried worked. From diet, exercise, yoga - to various supplements to support thyroid function. I was on Synthroid for a while years ago, but noticed no improvement and didn&#x27;t like the idea of taking a drug daily. I eliminated the stress in my life by choosing to follow my passion, had more control of my time and no dysfunction in my life. Yet, despite those changes, more inner peace and a healthy lifestyle, I still felt sluggish and was overweight. I decided to try Thyromine after reading mostly great reviews on various sites.    Since being on this supplement, I do not feel sluggish, nor do I have many of the bothersome symptoms that go along with that. For example, whenever I would experience humidity, it would drain me to the point of exhaustion, just walking around. Now it barely bothers me at all. I still sweat quite a bit, but that&#x27;s healthy, so that doesn&#x27;t bother me. What went away was the exhaustion. I seem to be able to handle it much better than I ever did before, as well s extreme heat.     Other benefits I&#x27;ve noticed is that my hair has thickened. I used to really notice the  thinning at the top of my scalp which is not nearly as noticeable.     I am taking the time to write this review as comprehensively as I can because I know it really does work. For anyone who is plagued with the same problems as I, it could really change your life. If you don&#x27;t have energy, life really isn&#x27;t much fun at all. There&#x27;s no price I can put on that. So I will be taking this supplement from now on, because I can&#x27;t imagine going back to the way I used to feel.    Old Review - after juststarting Thyromine.    I was diagnosed with an underactive Thyroid years ago. I took Synthroid for a while but found that I didn&#x27;t feel right. Upon doing some research, I found that Hypothyroid is tricky and that Synthroid can actually increase weight, so was not surprised to find later that a class action law suit had been filed against the company who made the product. Searching for diet and supplements, I took a number of thyroid support pills - some of which seemed to help a bit. I finally went off everything and just relied upon diet and exercise. Given that I was so diligent about my diet and exercise with such little success, I thought I&#x27;d see what else was out there in terms of a supplement. As the thyroid is such a central part of the body and affects so many things - it just seemed like it made sense to try to correct this situation with a supplement.    Finding Thyromine, I decided to give it a whirl.    Been on it for several weeks now. I open the capsule and mix it with water and a bit of juice each morning before breakfast. I usually have either yogurt or a protein smoothie each day with green tea. I&#x27;ve noticed some weight loss and more energy, for sure. I believe I have dropped at least one dress size. My clothes fit better and my spirits are better. For now, that&#x27;s good enough for me. I look forward to even better results over time as I haven&#x27;t finished 1 bottle yet.</li>
    <li> THYROMINE HEALTH SUPPLEMENT &amp; WEIGHT LOSS PILL FOR PEOPLE WITH UNDERACTIVE THYROIDS    It looks a good deal. The price seems about average.  I urgently need to renew my supply.    But there is no way I am going to purchase a product when the advertising quite deliberately avoids telling me how many tabs are in each tub !!!  C&#x27;mon... do you think we are all stupid !!!!    I want to know the dose/supply I am purchasing for my &#x27;bargain&#x27; price.  There may only be enough tabs for 1 week in the tub.. and then the buyer is the sucker.    Amazon you should be ashamed of yourselves for letting this one through !!!  .. and the company producing them needs a kick up the a..e !!  ..................................................................................</li>
    <li> I tried this product for a month and got no results. I am glad it worked for some people, but I have been off of it for several days now and can&#x27;t tell a difference in the way I felt on or off of it. I am still tired all the time, didn&#x27;t lose any weight. I did get a few headaches, though. I am not for sure that it was due to thyromine, but that is the only thing I was doing different. None since I&#x27;ve stopped taking the supplement.</li>
    <li> After buying from Amazon for years I finally feel compelled to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;After 12 weeks of increasing exercise and decreasing calories with no weight loss I bought Thyromine and I have lost three pounds in the first week.  And this is not just water weight.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.  I tried 7-keto with no effect.  This is the second thyroid supplement I have tried.  Natural Sources Raw Thyroid was the first and it didn&#x27;t have any effect either.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say that it will work for everyone, but it did for me.</li>
    <li> This is a total rip off . Do not waste your time on these products that promises amazing results but is false</li>
    <li> I started taking this in-lieu of medication when my thyroid count was a bit off.  The difference in my energy has been exceptional.  I&#x27;ve also noticed less aches (for lack of a better way to put it).  I haven&#x27;t had a doctor&#x27;s appointment yet to see if my thyroid count has changed, but how I feel overall is much better.  As for the &amp;#34;weight loss&amp;#34; part of it......didn&#x27;t have any help in that area.  Actually, I had lost about 14 pounds prior to putting this pill into my daily regimen and now have gained about 10 back.  But seeing as I wasn&#x27;t taking this from a weight loss aspect, I have been very happy with my result.  5 stars will come if my doctor gives me good news too!!!</li>
    <li> Good Thyroid Supplement and it seems to work OK.&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed to much of a difference in weight but&lt;br /&gt;it is for Thyroid issues and seems to have some benefits.</li>
    <li> I took the entire bottle and no weight loss. Did not work for me, however it may work for some.</li>
    <li> tried it for 3 weeks and all it did was left me feeling bloated, didn&#x27;t lose any weight.  did not help any of my other poor thyroid problems either.  some recommend taking it for much longer before seeing results....too expensive for me! no thanks!</li>
    <li> I took this for 1 month solid and I was hoping for some results and was very disappointed that I felt abosolutely no difference after taking this product. I did not try for a refund. It sounds like it worked for some people; maybe for you too. Just not for me.</li>
    <li> i have a very low thyroid. hypothyrodism for 3 years iv never lost any weight. my hair falls out im very very overweight have a slow metabolism. im not myself im always depressed. i dont enjoy life. my throats always sore my hair is AWFUL. iv tried every diet going. im currently on a steady dose of 250mcg thyroXine. its rubbish. iv just started taking thyroMine going to see how it goes. is there anyone out there with a thyroid as low as mine that thyroMine has worked for id love to know. thanks x</li>
    <li> I have taken it for a month, I feel more energetic and have the desire to want to do things again.</li>
    <li> THYROMINE HEALTH SUPPLEMENT &amp; WEIGHT LOOS PILL  ,i DIDN&#x27;T LOSE ANY WEIGHT WITH THESE SUPPLEMENTS AND I DIDN&#x27;T FEEL ANY BETTER WITH THEM</li>
    <li> Product was received with all accurate information. Number of pills is correct. Nutritional facts are accurate and up to date</li>
    <li> Thyromine gently helps with hypothyroid syptems.I can not tolerate perscribed thyroid meds. Helps with energy level and brain fog. So this product is a life saver.&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it was&#x27;nt so expensive. But I think I would be in big trouble with out it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my underactive Thyroid. Bloodwrok came back the same, no extra energy. Nothing noticable, so I can&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> After having an under active thyroid for last 8 years and being on medication, it&#x27;s a god send to find a product that actally helps with weight loss, I have put on well over 17 ibs since being diagnosed, and have tried every diet in the book but couldn&#x27;t even lose a pound,  have just finished my first bottle and I&#x27;m 7 ibs lighter with no dieting, very very happy with thyromine</li>
    <li> Helped clear up my skin and that&#x27;s about it.  I don&#x27;t think I would buy it again.  Not worth the price to me.</li>
    <li> I am 49, a former RN, and have had Hashimoto&#x27;s-type hypothyroidism for 15 years.  Like many others, I am looking for something that might return my energy levels and my life more towards normal.   The man-made synthetics just don&#x27;t work for me.   I tried Thyromine for about 6 weeks and have found that I am not particularly happy with it.   The addition of adrenal powder (these glands produce your adrenaline hormones as well as regulate your water/electrolyte balance) served only to give me a morning \\&quot;high\\&quot; and then I would come crashing down at about 3 or 4 pm.  They also have Nori in the combination, which is an excellent seaweed source for minerals and protein, used here for its iodine content.  Few understand that iodine helps some thyroid patients, but can greatly exacerbate the condition in others, causing sore throat, difficulty swallowing and, eventually goiter.  These tablets also contain Guglipid, L-tyrosine, ginger and Piper-Longum.     I did not lose weight.  There was no change in my \\&quot;dead\\&quot; libido.  (These are two areas of concern for most hypothyroid sufferers.)     There was one reviewer that reported that the 1mg of thyroid per capsule wasn&#x27;t enough.   I would like to say that 1mg is the standard dose for thyroid replacement.  You can go up or down from there, depending on symptoms and labwork.    In summary, I believe that the product is what it says it is on its ingredient list.  I am very sad that they included the adrenal powder and other items.   If you do not have adrenal insufficiency, take caution when using this, or any supplement, that has numerous glandular additions.  You can get more than you bargained for and end up \\&quot;confusing\\&quot; other glands that have very important balancing jobs to do in the body.  Be well-informed if you take any multi-glandular!       For your information, I am currently trying Ultra-Enterprises Raw Thyroid.  It is bovine-source thyroid, raw, freeze-dried and made into a tablet.  It seems to be less potent, and it does have \\&quot;fillers\\&quot; but I feel much better, taking one in the morning, and one at night.  So far, it is the best that I&#x27;ve come across for the thyroid \\&quot;searcher.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I went by the reviews on this site and others about Thyromine, and decided to try it. Wowww, mistake. I gained five pounds in two weeks of taking this stuff, had zero energy, felt incredibly fatigued all the time. It was a nightmare. I will never, ever touch this product again, nor any other by this company. Try at your own risk.</li>
    <li> Wow, i was diagnosed with Graves Disease in 2000. I have had my fair share of struggles that come with an underactive Thyroid. Recently I lost all my hair, I had terrible joint pains and gained 12 pounds.I went for a check up and the Doctor told me the blood tests were normal; I decided to do my own research on natural products that assisst Thyroid problems. I came across Thyromine and reluctantly ordered it. I have been using this product for 7 days and i have lost 2 pounds. I feel more energetic and positive. I love it!! Looking forward to loosing all the weight and growing my hair back.</li>
    <li> I have fibromyalgia and while looking up info on how to lose wieght with fibro. I read an article from the mayo clinic explaining how Thyroxine (along with other herbs) helps in restoring the body when faced with an auto immune disease. Thyromine restored my energy, helped my depression, and I now feel like and have the energy for exercise that I did not have before. One of the missconceptions is that it is a miracle wieght loss pill, well its not but it can be very benneficial in increasing energy enabling you to lose the weight. I have lost 10 pounds in one month which is huge for me since my metabolic rate tested to be around zero. I will continue taking and see how it goes.</li>
    <li> One Week Update&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has now been one week and I am losing weight. My temperature in the morning before taking the pill is now about 97.9. It was 96.7 before I began taking this supplement. It goes up to 98.6 after taking the pill. The bags under my eyes are beginning to go away. I am sleeping through the night on most nights now. That is something all by itself because I have sleep apnea. I am no longer getting sleepy at work. I have been able to quit taking some of my other supplements without any side effects. I have now started a new exercise program and am enjoying the extra energy. I will update again in about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review Below&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have taken this for 3 days now. It does raise my body temperature up to 98.6 or so. I am hoping it will stay up after taking the product for awhile. It goes down again about bedtime and I take this at around 6:30 am. The other changes so far are far more important. I feel better. My back does not hurt as much and I have a lot more energy. My breathing seems a little better too. Maybe my thyroid was starting to enlarge enough to interfere with breathing. I have asthma so the improvement in breathing may have to do with another medicine that was changed recently. So far, so good. I will update when it gets closer to a month to determine how much better things are.</li>
    <li> I have just finished the first bottle and have noticed that I have more energy to do things later into the afternoon.  It&#x27;s a very slow process, as it is with any herbal supplement.  I can&#x27;t wait to finish the next bottle!  I will purchase again!!</li>
