<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is working for me, better than most I have tried.  I am using all 3 cream, vitamin c and mask.  I have tried many.  I may stick with this one.</li>
    <li> It is absorbed quickly and prepares the skin for your moisturizer.  Much cheaper than a regular serum</li>
    <li> So I just got my serum and used it with the anti aging creame which on the jar says camu complex radiant skin fruitscription creme. My face feels softer and definitely more MOISTURIZED. The serum is thicker then baby oil but thinner then coco butter lotion.  Definitely doesn&#x27;t feel like an ointment.  Rubs in very easy and dries up rapidly. The serum didnt leave my face looking oily either! Woo hoo.&lt;br /&gt;I also have used it with the cream on my very dry hands and right away there is a difference.  The serum smells pleasant not like medicine. It sones in a sleek pump so you get a clean dispensed amount each time. I didn&#x27;t have to wipe the tip of the pump for the remaining product like i have had to with other pumps. GREAT PACKAGING!&lt;br /&gt;Also I love that it is not animal tested.</li>
    <li> Feels good on my face.</li>
    <li> As I was getting ready for bed, I washed my face &amp; I tried camuadvanced Plus Vita C Youth Recovery Eye Serum. I was given the opportunity to try this serum for the purposes of product testing and reviewing. I loved it! I love the fact that it is a pump dispenser so there is no waste and no contamination. Also, this serum had a gel consistency which made it easy to work with. I not only used it on my eyes, I used it on my whole face. I gently massaged the gel into my skin until all of it was absorbed. I could instantly feel the firming affects of this serum. My skin feels so incredibly soft, I love it. Plus it has vitamin C which in  known to help reverse the signs of aging. Plus this all natural serum also contains Coconut Oil, Pomegranate, Aloe &amp; Pure Green Tea Extract just to name a few. I also love that this is a gel serum. Serums tend to have a more concentrated dose of super hydrating ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;All statements made in this review are solely my own person opinion of this product and I can tell you  that I absolutely love it! I would certainly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Camu Advanced Youth Recovery Serum comes in a beautiful bottle that looks like a very high end product. Looking at the ingredients you can tell that this serum is going to be a very effective Vitamin C serum. It has Camu Camu, Noni, Mangosteen, Vitamin C and Hyaluronic acid which defend skin against harmful free radicals and provide hydration and moisture to skin. My skin is dry after the harsh winter and this serum has helped so much to supply the much needed hydration to my skin. Being a fan of Vitamin C I couldn’t resist the offer to try this outstanding serum for a promotional price to give my opinion about it. It also has coconut oil, Acai, Pomegranate and green tea extract. Together all these ingredients help in fighting fine lines and wrinkles. A light weight serum that absorbs quickly and leaves my skin smooth and radiant. I like the fact that it is paraben free and cruelty free. I can use my daily moisturizer on top of it without any problem and make up is so easy to apply. Made is USA is also an added bonus.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for 3 days but I love the texture and how it feels on my face.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with the transformation of my skin using this product. I have had several people tell me my skin is glowing. I have found that it soothes a sunburn and keeps my skin from peeling when I do get one. My pores are significantly smaller and my skin is tight and smooth. It smells amazing and absorbs quickly into the skin unlike a typical moisturizer or other serums. I love it!</li>
    <li> I like the design of this bottle. There&#x27;s no top to open or cap to lose. You simply pump the top to dispense the serum. I usually like to try a beauty product on the back of my hand before applying to my face. I applied it to the back of one hand to see the differences. First, I noticed the very faint, pleasant scent. It&#x27;s hardly noticeable but is refreshing. It&#x27;s a thick clear serum that soaks in pretty easily. Since it&#x27;s a little thick, it takes a little extra effort to rub in but it is lightweight. It does not leave a greasy look. It&#x27;s leaves my skin feeling smooth and bright. My skin also loos tighter and helps to fill in the wrinkles. I use this serum in the mornings under my makeup. I love that this serum is all natural and paraben free, not to mention made in the USA. This is a great price for the size. This bottle should last a very long time since you don&#x27;t have to use much at all. I received this product to test in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion. This is really one of the best serums that I&#x27;ve tried. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Lightweight and smooth this is a nice serum.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a gritty feeling on your face or hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a reduced rate for my review.</li>
    <li> Great but they stay sold out</li>
    <li> I love the lightness of the serum.  I have been using this serum for over a week and I can see a difference in my spots on my face and my fine lines around my eyes.  My skin feels firmer and looks brighter.  The size of this bottle is very big compared to other serums I&#x27;ve received that doesn&#x27;t work as well as this one.  I getting older and wanted something that would help my fresh wrinkles to diminish and help with the spots I have on my face and it looks like I have finally found the right product.  It&#x27;s lightweight and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky on my face.  I highly recommend this product if you have the same issues as me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for a truthful and unbiased review. My opinions and all thoughts reflected in this evaluation are solely my own.</li>
    <li> this helped heal my skin after picking at it and reduced redness and hyper-pigmentation, but i think there are cheaper alternatives that help my skin out just as much if not more. so i wont buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is a nice little addition to my beauty regime.  It feels light on my skin.  No colors or heavy fragrance.  I have only been using a week or so and have not noticed a significant difference in the areas around my eyes.  I purchased this as part of a promotional launch and am hoping that it continues to minimize the lines around my eyes more than it has already begun to.</li>
    <li> I ordered this serum as a sample for review and evaluation and I love it. The serum comes in a large bottle and I love that it is a pump. It has a nice consistency, not watery and not too thick. I love the scent, it&#x27;s not strong and it fades after it absorbs. After I wash my face I apply the serum (which absorbs very fast) and then I apply my normal moisturizer. I have noticed that it gives me a deeper hydration than just my normal moisturizer. It&#x27;s still winter here so I struggle with dry skin but this was a good boost for me! I am very happy with that and I have added this as a permanent part of my routine!</li>
    <li> I love this serum. It contains collagen,  super fruits like acai and camucamu and many other skin rejuvenating ingredients. It is not greasy and absorbs into the skin very quickly. My bottle however did not mark vitamin C on it.</li>
    <li> So far so good! I&#x27;m loving the results so far. It&#x27;s the most I have spent on any product for my face. But I&#x27;m so glad I did! My (apostrophe) lines around my mouth are almost gone!! Definitely will purchase again!!</li>
    <li> I really like this serum. It takes very little and goes on smooth and creamy. No strong smell or film after application. I can tell my skin has gotten more smooth and bright. Very happy!</li>
    <li> A lightweight, fragrant and non-greasy serum. I alternate this with my other vitamin C serums. It is highly absorbent and light. The best is the fragrance. I love it. It is gentle and pleasant. It keeps my skin hydrated and soft throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is also beautiful and well designed, elegant in a way. It is a big bottle and I expect it to last for some time at least. Very good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. I am an avid online shopper and do rely on online reviews for my online shopping decisions. I do not believe in giving dishonest or biased reviews.</li>
    <li> This serum comes in a very pretty bottle that looks expensive. It&#x27;s a nice big bottle too and since you don&#x27;t need a lot of it for your face, it&#x27;ll last for a long time. It is very light and doesn&#x27;t have any smell, which is important, since my boyfriend is sensitive to fragrances and some lotions that I use make him itch and sneeze lol It&#x27;s also not sticky and it gets absorbed by the skin really fast. This is a high quality product and I recommend it to everybody. I&#x27;m very glad to have received a sample of this product for testing and reviewing purposes.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing. I am sure anyone would love to implement this into their beauty regimen. It really goes on smooth and does not leave an oily finish. You can honestly feel it activating on application and as a night treatment it works really well. I recommend this for everyone. I got some for my mom and she is loving it !</li>
    <li> This is a great natural product with vitamin C and Camu camu.  I have been using it daily on my skin before my moisturizer.  It came in a large bottle and I only need a little.  I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make up often but want my skin to look better.  Since getting older my face is more dry and I have some wrinkles.  This goes on smoothly and dries very quickly.  It has a nice light scent.  This is great to be in my arsenal of products for my face to keep it healthy, glowing and less wrinkles.  I did get this complimentary  to try and give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> As a regular product tester of Vitamin C Serums, this one ranks in the top 2 of which I cannot choose a favorite. The packaging does rank superior. I love the bottle. It&#x27;s pretty enough to leave out on your dresser and the pump is integrated into the bottle so there&#x27;s no cap to lose or clean. It dispenses the exact amount of serum that&#x27;s needed for your face and neck. The ingredients are all organic and I love that they&#x27;ve used the Camu Fruits Vitamin C extract being that it&#x27;s the strongest available and it has a pleasant scent. I&#x27;ve been using other Vitamin C serums for the last 6 to 8 months with great results. I no longer have the rooster neck that I used to have. My point is after using many varieties, I can honestly say that this serum is much more firming than some of the others and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m looking for at the age of 51. I appreciate the opportunity to receive a complimentary sample to try this product to test as a consumer. When I run out of my remaining serums. I&#x27;ll be back to purchase more. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This serum is great. It doesn&#x27;t absorb immediately into the skin, but once it does it makes your skin feel very soft. It feels really nice. The pump makes it easy to get as much or as little as you want. It doesn&#x27;t take much, so a little goes a long way.  I received this for free as part of a promotion to try and give my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> what an awesome product!!</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed when I opened this Camu Advanced Youth Recovery Serum is it comes in a convenient stand-up pump tube. Merely prime it once or twice then it gives the desired amount (well, for me anyway) and apply to clean skin.This serum is an advanced, whole skin care with Camu Camu fruit and pomegranate. (Whole skin care meaning it works as an anti-aging serum and to diminish, eventually ridding, any dark spots while helping to reverse the aging process.) The main ingredient is Camu Camu fruit which is Brazilian and provides the strongest Vitamin C full of amino acids and anti-oxidants. This serum is made with only all natural organic ingredients (like the camu camu is) containing coconut oil, acai, noni, pomegranate, aloe, pure green tea extract, and mangosteen while being paraben free. All of these ingredients work together to help reverse the look of aging (kind of like a fake face lift!) For myself, an additional plus is that it is made here in the US in an FDA animal cruelty free lab!! You DEFINITELY get your moneys worth with this!! I have been using it daily for 15 days and not only do I see an improvement in the fine lines around my eyes and mouth but also I have not used even a quarter of the serum yet!! (I was provided a sample of this product through a promotion in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.  The information provided is solely my opinion and based on my personal experience.)</li>
    <li> PLEASE DO NOT BUY!!!!! CONTAINS PROPYLENE GLYCOL, AN INGREDIENT CLOSE TO ANTIFREEZE.  PLUS IT IS THE SECOND INGREDIENT!!!!!!! I WOULD RATE IT A 0000, BUT THERE IS NO OPTION, IT DOESNT EVEN DESERVE ONE STAR, too bad this company is lying to millions of people.   You are applying ingredients that belongs under the hood of your car, NOT YOUR FACE.</li>
    <li> I have been using Live Ultimate Anti-Aging Camu Complex for a few weeks and have been very pleased with the results.  The past few days, I have added Live Ultimate Best Vitamin C Serum, and the results have surprised me.  Using both products both in the morning and evening, the skin on my face, neck and chest has improved noticeably.  The fine lines around the eyes and mouth have softened, and my skin has a wonderful glow.  After cleaning my face, I apply the Best Vitamin C Serum - it doesn&#x27;t take but a couple of small drops - and then the Anti-Aging Camu Complex.  Thank you, Live Ultimate.  I am delighted with the results that I am getting from using your products!</li>
    <li> Very light weight! Usually, with my skin type, products leave me feeling very oily, and heavy. After this product dries, you forget that it was even applied! Odorless, and easy instructions. I didn&#x27;t expect the bottle to be as large as it is either! The photo is deceiving in a good way, that you actually receive more than you would imagine. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results &#x3D;) Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Pretty darn good stuff. I&#x27;m a guy and this works well for us too. No irritation of any kind! No scent either.. Skin looks good and seems to be helping with wrinkles and overall appearance.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for about 2 weeks . Yet to see a change . Maybe I am expecting too much . But the reviews did give me the kind of &amp;#34;Magic wand&amp;#34; experience. Time will tell its effectiveness .I am giving it 3 stars only because I like the fact that it does hydrates my skin and has no visible signs of oily face or a smell . But, really the rating should go for its property as an anti-aging lotion . That I have yet to see.</li>
    <li> Non greasy, no odor and great packaging. These are the plusses of the product. As for all of it claims, I can honestly say that I see very little change in my skin. Perhaps at 65 there is little that can help.</li>
    <li> I have fallen in love with LIVE ULTIMATE CAMU products. Their moisturizer ( anti-aging cream)  is one of the nicest I have, and now  C serum? Bonus! I find the two together keep my face hydrated and calms my mild rosacea. When I step out of the shower I use the C serum when my face is a bit wet. When it is dry I add moisturizer then go about my day. My face looks better without make up . I was given the opportunity to test and try this product and I could not be more pleased. I would not hesitate to recommend this product to anyone wanting to add C serum to their daily skin care routine.</li>
    <li> This product contains no parabens and isn&#x27;t tested on animals!  I also love that it&#x27;s made in the USA in a FDA approved lab.  The container it comes in is sleek and the applicator button is large - good design to it!  Since this is a serum, other products can be placed on your skin after it is applied.  That also means you&#x27;ll want to clean your skin prior to application of the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issues that this product addresses are: age spots, fine lines and wrinkles, sagging skin.  It does that by creating a barrier against free radicals in the skin.  Camu Camu, Noni, Mangosteen, Vitamin C, and Hyaluronic Acid aide in healing, hydrating, and reversing signs of premature aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The complete list of ingredients is:  Aqua(Deionized Water), Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe Vera Gel) Juice, Organic Glycerin, Soluble Collagen, Propanediol, Organic Myrciaria Dubia (Camu Camu) Fruit Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate (Vitamin C), Mushroom Beta Glucan, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Organic Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Organic Punica Granatum (Pomegranate) Extract, Organic Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cucurbita Pepo (Pumpkin) Seed Oil, Organic Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Astaxanthin (Cranberry Oil Extracts), a-Lipoic Acid, Morinda Citrifolia (Noni) Fruit Extract, Lycium Barbarum (Goji) Berry Extract, Garcinia Mangostana (Mangosteen) Peel Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Extract, Euterpe Oleracea (Acai) Berry Extract, Phenoxyethanol (antibacterial agent), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative enhancer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The folks at Live Ultimate were nice enough to provide me with this complimentary product so that I could evaluate it.
