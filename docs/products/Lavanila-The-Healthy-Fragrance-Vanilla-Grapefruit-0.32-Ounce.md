      <li>It is a strong scent, lasts all day, and I love it!!!!</li>
      <li>I bought this in hopes that it would have more of a grapefruit smell, because I read an article saying that guys are attracted to the smell of grapefruit, lol.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very sweet and has great staying power.</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>Love!</li>
      <li>And Pure Vanilla is awesome too.</li>
      <li>With free Prime shipping, it was a great deal on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nice to carry around in your purse though.</li>
      <li>If perfumes tend to give you a headache,  as many do me, this is a good one.</li>
      <li>Want a great clean smell and yummy smell..</li>
      <li>Great scent - many compliments and long wearing.&lt;br /&gt;Rollerball is the best invention.</li>
      <li>It is a great summer fragrance that is not overwhelming, just perfect.</li>
      <li>I love the vanilla and grapefruit combination and</li>
      <li>Overall, the fragrance rollerballs are great!</li>
      <li>best part about Lavanilla is that it&#x27;s the longest lasting perfume I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>and I love that.</li>
      <li>Love these products.</li>
      <li>Friends of mine love their products.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>but since wearing them all I really love Vanilla Grapefruit.</li>
      <li>Basically if you want grapefruit more than vanilla don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
      <li>Every time I wear this perfume I get so many compliments.</li>
      <li>I love it so much it was great.</li>
      <li>love this and will order more when this one runs</li>
      <li>Nice clean smell.</li>
      <li>the roller-ball dispenser means it is easy to keep in my purse.</li>
      <li>I was expecting light and fresh, and I got warm and musky.</li>
      <li>This sweet but not too sweet fragrance never fails to have people take note and ask what smells so good.</li>
      <li>This could be because it is easier to apply a lot more perfume faster with the perfume bottle atomizer than with the roller ball, but I thought maybe it would be worth mentioning here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This fit the bill.</li>
      <li>When I first put this on, I smell the grapefruit more than the vanilla.</li>
      <li>It took longer than I expected it to take getting sent to me but the product is great as I have used this for years.</li>
      <li>Sweet but not too sweet, vanilla-ish</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a citrus scent sort of girl so within the first 15 minutes, it&#x27;s too strong for me.</li>
      <li>I have given away so many bottles and keep coming back to purchase more.  </li>
      <li>I had to reapply it more frequently that I ever do with perfume,  but no headache!</li>
      <li>It is definitely more suited for a younger person such as myself, but the great smell is appreciated by all.</li>
      <li>also it wears off right away, no one could smell it on me 5 min after I put it on.</li>
      <li>I eventually purchased the perfume bottle as well, and for some reason, the perfume in the bottle seems to have more of a grapefruit edge to it, and last longer, than what I have in the rollerball.  </li>
      <li>I love that they are composed of essential oils.</li>
      <li>and I actually received some free samples with it which was cool.</li>
      <li>It does not smell &#x27;perfumy or like chemicals&#x27; since it is wholesomely natural, organic &amp; chemical free.</li>
      <li>I originally found this fragrance as a sample from my local Sephora, but of course they didn&#x27;t have the full size in stock.  </li>
      <li>I found this fragrance and the whole line at Sephora in Jacksonville, Florida.  </li>
      <li>Shipped really fast too.</li>
      <li>Really bummed this is being discontinued.  </li>
      <li>The roller ball is so much easier to carry with me where ever I go.  </li>
      <li>However, the smell is sweet, if a bit too much like candy and not enough of the grapefruit.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such a nice scent and lasts long.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a cologne that was portable, appropriate for everyday &amp; any occasion and under $50.</li>
      <li>Love the scent but this oil version is not so long lasting as the perfume bottle.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t last very long, and I wish it was more citrusy.  </li>
      <li>It does smell citrusy with a warm vanilla scent, but not like cookies, if you know what I mean.  </li>
      <li>It is subtle, warm, uplifting and feminine.</li>
      <li>I am very particular and always wear essential oil and natural perfume from Whole Foods.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a soft fragrance.</li>
      <li>The scent seems to &#x27;come alive&#x27; when it touches my skin.</li>
      <li>Despite the title &amp;#34;Roller Ball&amp;#34; somehow I was surprised when I received a roll-on bottle, not a spray.</li>
      <li>Lavanila Vanilla Grapefruit was the first perfume I ever got, and I have no doubt that I will use it for a long time.</li>
      <li>I had such high hopes.</li>
      <li>It smells cozy and sweet.</li>
      <li>The sharp edge of the grapefruit does seem to wear off after the first 45 minutes</li>
      <li>Even though the scent is subtle &amp; gentle it is rich at the same time.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this in hopes that it would have more of a grapefruit smell, because I read an article saying that guys are attracted to the smell of grapefruit, lol. I&#x27;m personally not a big fan of vanilla, but this was the only grapefruit perfume that I found so I tried it. If you like vanilla then you may like this. The grapefruit is just way to subtle for my taste. I have to rub it in (which they say not to do because it changed the chemical structure) in order for an ever slight scent of grapefruit to be noticable. Basically if you want grapefruit more than vanilla don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t last very long, and I wish it was more citrusy.  It&#x27;s a soft fragrance. If perfumes tend to give you a headache,  as many do me, this is a good one. I had to reapply it more frequently that I ever do with perfume,  but no headache!</li>
    <li> Love this! I store in my purse. Never leaked and always get compliments .</li>
    <li> Every time I wear this, someone comments on it...&lt;br /&gt;I am not a perfume wearer at all, but I got this as a sample at Sephora, and it is intoxicating.&lt;br /&gt;When I put this on, I know I am going to hear someone say, &amp;#34;Who smells so good?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> These scents by Lavanila are wonderful! I have the set of four mini-rollerball fragrances, one of each scent. I wasn&#x27;t sure which one I would like the best but since wearing them all I really love Vanilla Grapefruit. My husband is a fan of Vanilla Coconut. And Pure Vanilla is awesome too. Rollerballs are great because the fragrance stays on your skin and I love that. The deodorants don&#x27;t hold up well, stain your clothes white and smell a little strange actually. Have ordered 2 and have not been happy with them. Overall, the fragrance rollerballs are great!</li>
    <li> Yesterday, at Sephora I picked up Lavinila in grapefruit/vanilla blend. I&#x27;ve been looking for a cologne that was portable, appropriate for everyday &amp; any occasion and under $50. This fit the bill. I am very particular and always wear essential oil and natural perfume from Whole Foods. I am not a fan of artificial fragrance so this product is perfect for me. It is subtle, warm, uplifting and feminine. The vanilla gives the &#x27;warmth&#x27; and I don&#x27;t even like vanilla but I like it in this fragrance. It does not smell &#x27;perfumy or like chemicals&#x27; since it is wholesomely natural, organic &amp; chemical free. It does not give me a headache or make me feel sick like most colognes. With this fragrance a little goes a long way which I also like. The scent seems to &#x27;come alive&#x27; when it touches my skin. Even though the scent is subtle &amp; gentle it is rich at the same time.</li>
    <li> Despite the title &amp;#34;Roller Ball&amp;#34; somehow I was surprised when I received a roll-on bottle, not a spray. So my clothes will never smell nice! However, the smell is sweet, if a bit too much like candy and not enough of the grapefruit.</li>
    <li> This product came on time and I actually received some free samples with it which was cool. It is a strong scent, lasts all day, and I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I found this fragrance and the whole line at Sephora in Jacksonville, Florida.  Every time I wear this perfume I get so many compliments. I have given away so many bottles and keep coming back to purchase more.  Want a great clean smell and yummy smell.. Get this perfume!!  I buy both the bottle spray and the roller ball. The roller ball is so much easier to carry with me where ever I go.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
    <li> Best fragrance ever. Sweet but not too sweet, vanilla-ish but not like you&#x27;d just baked a cake. It&#x27;s terrific.</li>
    <li> the smell was not as described, there is no grapefruit in it, just vanilla. also it wears off right away, no one could smell it on me 5 min after I put it on.</li>
    <li> Perfume smells great!!!</li>
    <li> When I first put this on, I smell the grapefruit more than the vanilla. I&#x27;m not a citrus scent sort of girl so within the first 15 minutes, it&#x27;s too strong for me. Once it warms it smells beautiful! The vanilla scent pops up and the grapefruit is muted. It&#x27;s such a nice scent and lasts long.</li>
    <li> I was expecting light and fresh, and I got warm and musky. It doesn&#x27;t smell *bad*, it&#x27;s just not my preference.</li>
    <li> Love these products. Great fragrance!</li>
    <li> Omg! Best smelling perfume ever. I always get compliments. Shipped really fast too.</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes. Read some really great reviews and know them to produce great stuff. Friends of mine love their products.&lt;br /&gt;This smell awful and it&#x27;s still sitting in the package.&lt;br /&gt;Sending it back.</li>
    <li> Lavanila Vanilla Grapefruit was the first perfume I ever got, and I have no doubt that I will use it for a long time. It&#x27;s very sweet and has great staying power. It is definitely more suited for a younger person such as myself, but the great smell is appreciated by all.</li>
    <li> Not for me at all....YUK! didn&#x27;t like it at all. Will return if Amazon will take this back.</li>
    <li> Nice clean smell. Great purse perfume.</li>
    <li> I originally found this fragrance as a sample from my local Sephora, but of course they didn&#x27;t have the full size in stock.  With free Prime shipping, it was a great deal on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fragrance does not smell like a food item to me, in spite of the \\&quot;Vanilla Grapefruit\\&quot; description.  It does smell citrusy with a warm vanilla scent, but not like cookies, if you know what I mean.  The sharp edge of the grapefruit does seem to wear off after the first 45 minutes or so on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the few perfumes I have found that does not make me sneeze all day, and seems to be a soft enough fragrance that it doesn&#x27;t bother others while I am at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this and will order more when this one runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small update:  I eventually purchased the perfume bottle as well, and for some reason, the perfume in the bottle seems to have more of a grapefruit edge to it, and last longer, than what I have in the rollerball.  This could be because it is easier to apply a lot more perfume faster with the perfume bottle atomizer than with the roller ball, but I thought maybe it would be worth mentioning here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t buy a lot of perfume, so maybe this is something that is commonly known be perfume aficionados, but it was a new experience to me.</li>
    <li> Really bummed this is being discontinued.  Great scent - many compliments and long wearing.&lt;br /&gt;Rollerball is the best invention. Love!</li>
    <li> It took longer than I expected it to take getting sent to me but the product is great as I have used this for years.</li>
    <li> The fragrance was just a little too heavy for me.  Not offensive just not for me.  I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Mmmmmmm. This sweet but not too sweet fragrance never fails to have people take note and ask what smells so good. I love the vanilla and grapefruit combination and the roller-ball dispenser means it is easy to keep in my purse. It is a great summer fragrance that is not overwhelming, just perfect.</li>
    <li> I love it so much it was great. But I hate saphora stop selling it cause I had to search for it. But then thought about online</li>
    <li> Love the scent but this oil version is not so long lasting as the perfume bottle. Nice to carry around in your purse though. I love that they are composed of essential oils.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Lavanilla for years. It&#x27;s my go-to! It smells cozy and sweet. (People do tell me I smell like cake, but I like that)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part about Lavanilla is that it&#x27;s the longest lasting perfume I&#x27;ve ever bought. Even the more expensive ones I wear- Lolita, Flowerbomb- they last far less than Lavanilla. I&#x27;d say around 12 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
