    <li> Very nice color - rich dark purple -- almost black. I wish I&#x27;m better at applying it on because of its dark color you can easily see where i messed up!</li>
    <li> Everywhere I turn, women are wearing this color.  They are always out of it at the salon so I bought it for myself.  The price was reasonable and so was the shipping. You cannot beat OPI&#x27;s quality; the color really endures.</li>
    <li> Nail polish comes off.</li>
    <li> I love this color and OPI makes such great nail polish. This color is still really popular and looks great on anyone I think!</li>
    <li> The nail polish arrived broken. I contacted the seller and they quickly provided a replacement. The color looks great on especially for winter.</li>
    <li> My friend had this color and I immediately tried to find it to no avail. It&#x27;s an awesome dark color, probably the darkest you can go before just wearing black. Looks super chic on.</li>
    <li> This is a great dark color, I would call it a very dark burgandy.   I used two coats and I thought the color was very rich.   Quality of the polish is great like all OPI nail polish.   I had a couple days chip free!</li>

    <li> If your looking for a dark polish that will last then look no farther as this is another quality OPI color. Looks great with dark skin tones and can work for all occasions. One of my favorites!</li>
    <li> The polish I received was not the same color used in the salon even though it had the same name. It was also bubbly. Not a good purchase.</li>
    <li> This is it!&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for that almost black, trendy, sexy color, this is the real one.  You won&#x27;t find a better one.&lt;br /&gt;It takes two coats, and when I get a pedi at a salon, the color lasts 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> My Nail polish arrived broken and all over the package.  I contacted the company that evening concerning my broken polish and received a reply the very next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They replaced my nail polish with no problems and within 24 hours. I am completely satisfied with my Polish and&lt;br /&gt;the customer service.</li>
    <li> My fav OPI color, hard to find now</li>
    <li> I thought it was black because of the picture. I was wrong. It&#x27;s deep purple. Ugh..</li>
    <li> Was not Lincoln park after dark and the bottle was broken when I got it a month later.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my niece, who had put it on her Amazon wish list.  She opened the present, and almost immediately went to get the manicure set.  Within minutes, she had a completed, modern look so popular with the 20-somethings.</li>
    <li> My favorite OPI color! I get this almost everytime I get my nails done and bought a bottle of it so I could do touchups in between. Gorgeous dark, rich eggplant color. Looks great on every skin tone! Would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite OPI color. I always get it when I get a pedi so now I can use it at home!</li>
    <li> I have heard this is one of their most popular polishes. It is a very dark purplish-red. I did a half moon manicure with LPAD as the half moon and a bright red on top, it really brought out the burgundy hues.</li>
    <li> I wore this when it came out at my nail shop. Wanted to have my own. Love this color.</li>
    <li> I really love this polish. I use it with my essie matte about you. I have only had it on my nails on my hands but will try it next on my toenails</li>
    <li> the OPI Lincoln Park After Dark is great! the color is dark and rich and looks amazing. This is the regular gloss and i love it. It has become my go to nail polish. However i was looking for the matte and the description didn&#x27;t clearly differentiate what finish this was. (found the matte elsewhere and love it too!)</li>
    <li> NEVER HAVE I PUT ON THIS DARK COLOR, BUT I SEE WOMEN WITH IT ON, SO I DID IT FOR A CHANGE AND FUN, I SEE WOMEN ON TV SHOWS WITH IT ON,</li>
    <li> Love OPI! All of their polishes work well to me. The color is great and very vibrant to me. Yay!</li>
    <li> This polish is a deep hue with hints of purple, black and brown.  Perfect for fall.  One of my favorite OPI colors.</li>
    <li> It was great for quite awhile but when I used probably a bit over half of it, it started coming out goopy and wouldn&#x27;t dry well or at all.</li>
    <li> This took over a month to get to me. I needed it for a birthday, and it did not make it in time.</li>
    <li> This color is so, so fabulous! And the polish lasts a long time! I would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone who love deep, dark nail color.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of dark polishes available, but I love this one because it has a hint of deep purple. Love this tone.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;m not quite into dark nails for my fingernails it is amazing for my toes.  I love the look of the darker polish.  I love the shine.  Its exactly what I wanted.  I bought a second bottle for my daughter and she loves it too.</li>
    <li> Awesome color. More of a purple than a burgundy/brown which I was expecting, but still gorgeous.</li>
