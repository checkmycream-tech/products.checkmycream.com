<li> It does a delicate job very well.</li>
<li> Sad really.</li>
<li> A little dissapointed with this cuticle nipper because of the unique small cutting area.  </li>
<li> Sharp, but hard to see what you are cutting, relatively petite for a man&#x27;s hand.</li>
<li> They don&#x27;t get dull.</li>
<li> These nippers were touted as being very sharp and it&#x27;s why I ordered them, not all that sharp and very disappointing!</li>
<li> Both had bad edges and not very precise.  </li>
<li> it keeps the end of the cuticle uncut</li>
<li> The edges are so bad that instead of cutting, they tear.  </li>

    <li> Not very sharp . .&lt;br /&gt;Cannot lock . . .</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT HIGH QUALITY ITEM</li>
    <li> These might be too good. They don&#x27;t get dull.</li>
    <li> A++++++. Super fast shipping and a great deal!  Thank you!!!!!!</li>

    <li> Very nice and high quality material Thanks for this extra good service, this product complies to the highest standards. I will buy this any time again!!</li>
    <li> Seki makes good products but I much prefer the 1/2 jaw size, which Seki does not make. This unit instead of making a clean cut it keeps the end of the cuticle uncut so you have to cut the end with one more time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth the money to get a quality product like this, they&#x27;re sharp and work very well.  Definitely not your $.99 clippers.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described - which was a great thing in this case :)  Would repurchase and recommend. Seems high quality and long lasting. Would make a nice little stocking stuffer or small gift with other hand/nail items. We also have the toenail clippers, and two sets of fingernail clippers. No going back to cheap drugstore versions after using SEKI!</li>
    <li> I bought another brand at the same time and that didn&#x27;t work well, just like this one.  Both had bad edges and not very precise.  Tossed both of them already.  Will continue looking for one that actually works.  The edges are so bad that instead of cutting, they tear.  Sad really.</li>
    <li> I have purchased a couple of Seki edge products and have not been dissapointed by any of them.  This nipper does not disappoint.  A bit pricey but worth it in my book.</li>
    <li> A little dissapointed with this cuticle nipper because of the unique small cutting area.  Be sure this is what you want if you decide to purchase.</li>
    <li> This 1/4 size allows for precision in cleaning up my cuticles between manicures.  I have a 1/2 size one already which is better for the actual manicure.  This item feels very well made and has a plastic cover to protect the edges.</li>
    <li> They work ok enough.  Was hoping they&#x27;d be a bit sharper, but still better than you&#x27;d find in a department store.</li>
