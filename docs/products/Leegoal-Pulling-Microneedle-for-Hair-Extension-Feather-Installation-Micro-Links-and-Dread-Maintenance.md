      <li>the shipping was fast and small enough to pull beads through, perfect for i tipped extensions!&lt;br /&gt;i am very pleased with my purchase especally at the price</li>
      <li>but after practicing a little, i got the hang of it, and it&#x27;s really great.</li>
      <li>They would be great if the metal part was actually reinforced, rather than cheaply stuck into the wooden handle.</li>
      <li>I bough this instead of the plastic threading ones because I wanted a more professional one.</li>
      <li>Other than that, good product.</li>

      <li>broke too easily ... and the dreads were soft...</li>

      <li>Durable too, I have C4 hair and it has not broken.</li>
      <li>I do wish that the hoop would stay closed a bit more because sometimes it opens when you dont want it to</li>
      <li>yep this work very well for</li>

      <li>they both arrived in about 7 days, i got two different styles even though I just reordered the exact same thing, so yours might look different</li>
      <li>Came from China to California and arrived a week and a half earlier than expected. :)</li>
      <li>It broke alread on the side but other then that very small which I love</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> the shipping was fast and small enough to pull beads through, perfect for i tipped extensions!&lt;br /&gt;i am very pleased with my purchase especally at the price</li>
    <li> This product is as promised and did arrive on time and in perfect condition. I would def order from them again and than you for your time.</li>
    <li> First time I used it, it came out of the handle, very poorly seated. The handle also has a crack running down the side.  Also when it says \\&quot;micro\\&quot; it is, almost to small to pull ALL types of hair.</li>
    <li> This came nicely packaged with my crimp beads and came at a pretty good timing. I appreciate it the timeliness!!</li>
    <li> Works great. Very dainty, which is what I needed to fit the itsy bitsy crimping beads over while applying feather extensions to dogs.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to find something to make it easier to put a feather in my daughter&#x27;s hair but there were not clear enough instructions on how to use it and wished it was easier for my daughter to understand so that she could do it herself since she likes to change her feathers a lot.  Other than that, good product.</li>
    <li> This thing is great in general, but it&#x27;s even better because it&#x27;s so inexpensive! I was putting my feather extensions in with a little crochet hook before buying this and I had trouble getting all my strands of hair into the crimp bead. The little \\&quot;trap door\\&quot; mechanism on this thing keeps everything in order. Great purchase! :)</li>
    <li> Got these to put feather extensions into my hair - I bought these and the metal loop :([[ASIN:B004V4HOOQ MicroRing Links Bead Loader, Looper and Threader for Hair Extension Installation tool]]) because I thought this one, with the tiny metal clasp, would be hard to use - it isn&#x27;t I much prefer this to the loop which pulled my hair when I used it.  I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this cheap, so i guess i wasnt expecting perfection, but the metal was rusted and the little latch was broken. it works when it wants to. spend the money, and buy a better one.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it. The metal pice broke of within an hour of me opening it from the paackage.</li>
    <li> these are good for the price they work great for thiner dreads my dreads are like a pinky finger and smaller so it works great for them the handels are kinda ruff and it feals like it could brake off but im being carefull and the claws work great - over all good</li>
    <li> it was broken when i first got it. It was cheap so it didn&#x27;t matter to me. but the locking thing on it was a pain.</li>
    <li> Exactly what the photo depicts. I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything high quality when ordering, so I wasn&#x27;t surprised that it was a bit flimsy. Does what it says it should and no complaints. Not bad for such an inexpensive product.</li>
    <li> Fell apart the first time i used it had to glue it back together i wouldnt recommend getting this</li>
    <li> I didnt like these at all, pull the hair and takes longer to thread the hair. I chose another style threader that I love!</li>
    <li> Mom did feather hair extensions for a 12 year old&#x27;s sleepover party.  The tool was easy to use and will last for as long as I need it.  Separate some hair. Bead on. pick up hair with tool.  Pull through.  Easy.  Squash the bead with a pliers and you are done.  Kids love it.  Tinsel was harder.  Took more finger skills... no tool to help.  Maybe I should have used the beading tool for it!</li>
    <li> It did what it was supposed to, feels a bit fragile, but it didnt break with me, and i&#x27;m a bit clumsy!</li>
    <li> bought a couple of these am happy with them for what i use them for very good price thank you so much Stacey</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s about half the size that I had hope it would be and seems a little flimsy.  But it works.</li>
    <li> I recieved my product just 2 days after I placed my order and when I recieved the product I was greated by a letter thanking me for my business and a little swedish fish :) Very great product I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I bough this instead of the plastic threading ones because I wanted a more professional one. It works great and got here fast. I like it way better than the string threaders.</li>
    <li> not at all what I expected it&#x27;s a lot bigger than what you think</li>
    <li> I finally have a solution for seamlessly combining some of my small locs! This tool inserts easily into my locs and I&#x27;ve combined several locs without any snags nor other unwanted issues. I love this little thing. It is very small and great for my pencil-sized or smaller locs.</li>
    <li> I use this for feather extensions and it works just as i expected it to. I do wish that the hoop would stay closed a bit more because sometimes it opens when you dont want it to and you have to start over but what do you expect from something that is only a couple bucks.</li>
    <li> I got this to tighten my dreads. This thing was so weak and poorly designed, it broke right away. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for any use.</li>
    <li> Great tool! The tool is sturdy but the needle part is a little short. Either way, it does it&#x27;s job! I like the wood finish and the gold detail. Does not feel flimsy.</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier that expected and looks just like the picture. I bought it for my dreads but now that I have it, i&#x27;m not entirely sure how to use this :( can someone help me?</li>
    <li> Too big for my dreads,  I decided to throw it away.  Maybe I am using it wrong?</li>
    <li> I actually haven&#x27;t really had a chance to use this product a lot. just once or twice since I got it but it was ok both times. I do not have sufficient time with the product to rate it any higher at the moment. Like, I have no idea if it will break if I was using it often like others said their experience with it was. Once I have used it more, I can update my rating at that time.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with product. Unable to find it in my area but found it here. Also the quality of my product was as I expected or better.</li>
    <li> I love this little guy  it has been a dream and has helped greatly with my projects so far I am very happy</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for people with thick dreads but even using in my thick dreadlocks it still did not bend or break. Works well. :)</li>
    <li> Bought for crochet braiding. Small, but works. Did find a bigger two color hook at a beauty supply for a dollar.</li>
    <li> When I received this product, I only used it a couple of times and it broke.</li>
    <li> made a nice gift for a friend</li>
    <li> its okay for the price</li>
    <li> Worked great, used in the salon.</li>
    <li> This item is for installing feathers or fairy hair.  Don&#x27;t know how you would do it without this little tool.</li>
    <li> Used it for maybe five miss at the most and it broke right off at the wood piece. Not worth a dim.</li>
    <li> yep this work very well for a extension.thought the picture show was way smaller than product itself.is isnt small like the pic you see here.it little bigger.thought i cant tell the sizes cause they tell you. but happy with this sizes. work very good indeed.</li>
    <li> It was rusty and dirty when I got it, I don&#x27;t even want to use it anymore when I saw it.</li>
    <li> nice small needle for dreading hair.</li>
    <li> Much smaller than I expected and the hook broke off after using it twice.</li>
    <li> Nice, I wish the loop hole for the hair would have been a little bit bigger, but it gets the job done!!! I would recommend this item to others!</li>
    <li> cheap, handle came off right after one use</li>
    <li> At first i was disappointed because it opens at the top instead of just having a loop to thread your hair through..but after practicing a little, i got the hang of it, and it&#x27;s really great. There is a really nice design on the handle and it&#x27;s great quality. Not flimsy or cheap. I ordered two and both were exactly the same. Came very quick too! Came from China to California and arrived a week and a half earlier than expected. :)</li>
    <li> It broke alread on the side but other then that very small which I love</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these in the mail, even after being skeptical from reading many bad reviews about the product being cheaply made and old. I am 100% satisfied. I used these to tighten my dreadlocks, and it is by far the best method. My dreads look amazing! It took about a week and a half to get the product shipped to Alabama, but was well worth the wait. Though they do look cheaply made, they&#x27;ve held together well, even through vigorous uses. I highly recommend this product. It may be cheap, but it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I love my tool and the fast service!</li>
    <li> I bought this to do maintenance on my dreads and the latch piece broke off the second day using it.</li>
    <li> Very Fast shipping, the item looks exactly as described, it&#x27;s pretty sturdy and the price is VERY reasonable, I use this tool to make lace front wigs. Overall, I am pleased with my purchased and will buy from this seller again :D</li>
    <li> Poorly made and it fell apart the first day I used it</li>
    <li> Works great for dreads!! I think it is perfect and it&#x27;s sooooo cheap!</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and it was exactly as it was described on the site.  Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I give a four because I was using it on my own head. It took awhile getting used to but eventually, the job was done. And I must add, very nicely.</li>
    <li> It brakes fairly easily, but other than that it does it job wonderfully.. My dreads were tightened up nicely with this tool.. Which made me pretty happy:)</li>
    <li> Love it! I bought one and lost it, so I bought a second since its such a great deal, I used it to tighten my dreads and love it.  (: they both arrived in about 7 days, i got two different styles even though I just reordered the exact same thing, so yours might look different annnnd, I would recommend buying two just incase one breaks, mine survives now due to my extreme caution, because its clearly delicate.  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Item arrived very quickly, was exactly as described, good quality that I was unable to find in any beauty supply</li>
    <li> this is perfect for dread maintenance and I used it for about two weeks before the latch broke off in one of my dreads :/ still this is probably the ideal crochet hook for dreadlocks you just need to be very careful with it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS THING!!!! best thing I ever bought for my hair. Durable too, I have C4 hair and it has not broken.</li>
    <li> I tried using this for dread upkeep as far as tightening loose hairs, DOES NOT WORK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there&#x27;s a little latch that keeps on getting snagged when trying to pull in hairs, it eventually broke off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the hook itself is too big. it wasn&#x27;t mentioned in the product description, but for the price, i figure i try it out. it turns out to be about 2mm. its best to use a hook between .5mm and 1mm. it not only grabs the loose hair, but when trying to pull it into the dread, it just brings the loose hair close to it rather than tucking it in.</li>
    <li> broke too easily ... and the dreads were soft... too late to return</li>
    <li> not what I expected it was very small</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I&#x27;m sure it will come in handy. Made well, good price.</li>
    <li> it is a good quality for just 69 cents and shipping was really fast.</li>
    <li> Very handy when you have dreads. Good product.</li>
    <li> I definitely got what I paid for. Never getting these again. I bought two, and both of the hooks dislocated from the handle within one hour. They would be great if the metal part was actually reinforced, rather than cheaply stuck into the wooden handle.</li>
