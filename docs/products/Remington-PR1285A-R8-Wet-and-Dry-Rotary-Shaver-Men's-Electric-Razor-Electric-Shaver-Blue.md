### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This Remington PR1285A would make a wonderful gift for any man who uses an electric shaver.  </li>
      <li>Works great on my head but not on my face!</li>
      <li>All in all, it got an excellent review.</li>
      <li>It is better for use in the shower and you need some gel to get the best shave from it.  </li>
      <li>The blades flex a LOT and seem to do a good job conforming to your face, chin and neck.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall it works good</li>
      <li>Remington shaver with some good features.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a storage case so it might not be good for travel</li>
      <li>It might not be a good idea to store the razor in the shower.</li>
      <li>I found I could just use the shaver in a gentler fashion and still get a good</li>
      <li>/&gt;It works nice and holds a charge so you can use it while you&#x27;re traveling if you need to.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, the Remington PR1285A WetTech Lithium Rotary shaver would be a nice shaver for in-home and travelling use.</li>
      <li>it works well on a light beard but isn&#x27;t so good for a heavier one.</li>
      <li>good for quick shaving&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it has a charging stand but it can take some fiddling to make sure it&#x27;s charging correctly</li>
      <li>I love it even more than my Remington PR1235.  </li>
      <li>Nothing cracked and as able to reassemble it with no tools and it is continue to work well ever since.</li>
      <li>I love that it gives me a close shave</li>
      <li>The Remington seems to do well in the shower, and with more use and practice, I&#x27;ll either be trained in use or my face will become smarter?  </li>
      <li>The Remington seems to do well in the shower, and with more use and practice, I&#x27;ll either be trained in use or my face will become smarter?  </li>
      <li>But used on a daily basis, a shaver like this is perfect.</li>
      <li>My husband was pleased to be able to test this shaver.  </li>
      <li>It performs perfectly for him and when he goes off to college, I will most likely get him a better shaver.</li>
      <li>I noticed that I&#x27;m using more shaving gel than with a razor, mostly because I&#x27;m reapplying.  </li>
      <li>Feels noticeably lighter than the older metal Remington rotary shaver - which is great, since dropping it on my feet isn&#x27;t out of the question.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Would not recommend this to anyone looking for a nice, neat, clean shave.</li>
      <li>I share this story to say even though many people have said is build quality is not as good as Norelco it still good enough.</li>
      <li>However, the newer model has a floating head in addition to the floating blades, which makes it move more easily over the curves of the face, legs, and under the arms.  </li>
      <li>The heads pop off for easy cleaning.</li>
      <li>The charging is easy and works without having to play around with the connections.</li>
      <li>He commented on how lightweight it is, and it is easy to grip</li>
      <li>This is a lightweight shaver made of a not so strong plastic.</li>
      <li>The Remington PR1285A R8 WetTech Lithium Rotary Shaver, Blue, is a beautiful, sleek, easy-to-hold, lightweight shaver.  </li>
      <li>I prefer the Williams Lectric Shave because it is easy to buy, easy to use, and very economical.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad it has a quick charge function that allows me to continue my shave if the battery dies.  </li>
      <li>This would make a good gift for the shaver in your house with a light beard, e.g., a new shaver or one going off to college or just to get the teenager in your house from using your shaver and not cleaning it out..  </li>
      <li>The shaving heads are also easy to maintain and clean.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m primarily comparing this razor to blades in the shower and a 10-year-old Norelco electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>An LED light lets me know when it is charging or if it needs to be charged.  </li>
      <li>This might be important to know if you intend to travel with it without the charging stand, but I would just take the stand along myself.</li>
      <li>This model is easy to clean, easy to use and does an adequate job.</li>
      <li>The shaver provides a clean cut for my light beard.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy and appears to be keeping it clean.  </li>

      <li>He has been using an electrict shaver for a number of years, so is familiar with the differences between the models.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s power-strip friendly if your power-strip is  &amp;#34;stacked&amp;#34; not &amp;</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s power-strip friendly if your power-strip is  &amp;#34;stacked&amp;#34; not &amp;</li>
      <li>Once a week though you need to take out the heads and clean them thoroughly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like this razor and it will become my primary razor because it performs good enough.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s nothing special.  </li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s a good run for any daily use</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s a good run for any daily use</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about dropping it in a sink full of water and ruining it.  </li>
      <li>instructions claim it charges full in 90 minutes and lasts for 60 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The new Remington R8 Lithium Rotary razor gives me a fast, close, and clean shave, which is the equal of the best that I have had.</li>
      <li>older model feels better in the hand, in size, contour, and in the placement of the areas with a soft-touch finish.  </li>
      <li>The shaver quickly charges so that I can always shave twice a day if I needed to do this.  </li>
      <li>One thing I like about this shaver is the 5 minute quick charge.</li>
      <li>One thing I like about this shaver is the 5 minute quick charge.</li>
      <li>It has a rubber like material down two sides of the contoured handle that helps with gripping and has the right curve to fit your hand nicely.</li>
      <li>It was lightweight, easy to use in those tight spaces that must be shaved on men&#x27;s faces and gave a good, close shave.  </li>
      <li>Remington shavers under $100 are often a great deal for a few months but after that seem to fall apart or just not shave closely.</li>
      <li>The Remington PR1285A WetTech Lithium Rotary shaver works quite nicely for my daily shaving.</li>
      <li>A more thorough clean may be possible with a cleaning brush, but not letting it dry up and gunk up is probably a good daily practice and the rinse under the shower head seems to do that nicely.  </li>
      <li>in all, this is a good shaver for the price point, and I&#x27;m sure it will last me for several years to come.</li>
      <li>Women like to use electric shavers, too, and this WetTech electric razor is nice and lightweight, fits into smaller hands and works well in the shower, where I prefer to shave my legs.</li>
      <li>A more thorough clean may be possible with a cleaning brush, but not letting it dry up and gunk up is probably a good daily practice and the rinse under the shower head seems to do that nicely.  </li>
      <li>The shape and the plastic the handle is manufactured from gives a good grip even when wet.  </li>
      <li>power button is easy to press for one-handed shaving and the attached trimmer is easy to open and use as well.</li>
      <li>-- right?  </li>
      <li>Additionally, instead of using a &amp;#34;S&amp;#34; type of blade portion for that part of the head, they seem to have opted for a more common design that mimics how Philips shavers have with each individual set of blades able to rotate freely in a direction of their choosing, this, in practice, made for a more smooth shaving experience.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s right where it should be for</li>
      <li>-- right?  </li>
      <li>I fell in love with it because it gave me a quick, comfortable shave within a few minutes.  </li>
      <li>In July 2014, I received my first electric shaver from the Amazon Vine Program--the Remington PR1235 R3 Power Series Rotary Shaver ([[ASIN:B00IMNLD4Y</li>
      <li>First, it didn&#x27;t give me as close a shave as my disposable razor blades.  </li>
      <li>When charging, always remember to plug the cord into the shaver first before connecting it to the electrical outlet.  </li>
      <li>first experience wasn&#x27;t encouraging.  </li>
      <li>The razor is light weight, contours to the hand well, and is easy to hold even when wet.</li>
      <li>clean the shaver you pop open the shaver head section, use the brush to clean the debris out from the head section and rinse it with water.</li>
      <li>It still gets a pretty good trim, but, as with most electric razors, it has a more difficult time shaving if you have several days of growth and also hurts a bit as it catches hairs at angles when they&#x27;re too long.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does a good job--doesn&#x27;t pull or pinch--and the only problem I have with it is that it somewhat loud, particularly in an enclosed shower.</li>
      <li>Also, I once told a coworker, \\&quot;I am not a drag queen; I don&#x27;t need a smooth, hairless face.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>I continued to follow up with a razor for certain areas around my chin that don&#x27;t seem to take to rotary cuts as close..</li>
      <li>What I like about this product is its light weight and that it operates quite quietly as compared to my existing electric shaver.</li>
      <li>My former one, Remington PR1235, didn&#x27;t have one and, because of its cylindrical design, it rolled onto the floor; fortunately, it didn&#x27;t break.  </li>
      <li>I hit it with an overnight charge and ready for a Monday trial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The motor does sound underpowered but the shave is close  and relatively effortless.  </li>
      <li>I agree with others who say it is better if you use it wet.</li>
      <li>found it works great in the dry setting and decently in the wet setting.</li>
      <li>You are not rinsing the whole shaver, just the head section.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s entirely waterproof, as I&#x27;ve used it in the shower several times, and is exceedingly easy to clean.</li>
      <li>I like the versatility of being able to shave in or or out of the shower and in other countries I may travel to.</li>
      <li>Many of the other reviews are taking this razor to task for things</li>

      <li>shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both can be used wet or dry, are comfortable in the hand, have similar blades and foils, and will give a good shave.  </li>
      <li>The Remington PR1285 rotary razor is very similar to the previous AQ7 model B00BB5YFEU and is a good choice in a rotary</li>
      <li>This razor will do the job for the price, but don&#x27;t expect anything fancy or extremely high quality.</li>
      <li>It charges fast and is easy to clean, plus it&#x27;s small enough that it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space on my bathroom sink.</li>

    <li> Shaver works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions claim it charges full in 90 minutes and lasts for 60 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a plastic charging stand. The stand is light and feels unstable and is a little finicky to use. It has pins that fit into slots in the shaver that hold it in place in the stand, but it&#x27;s hard to tell if you put it in securely or not because it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;click&#x27; into place.&lt;br /&gt;Too troublesome to use the stand to store the shaver; ended up using it only for charging.</li>
    <li> Women like to use electric shavers, too, and this WetTech electric razor is nice and lightweight, fits into smaller hands and works well in the shower, where I prefer to shave my legs. I had a Norelco that died on me a couple of years ago, and this shaver is lighter in weight and easier to hold onto with wet hands, I think. It does a good job--doesn&#x27;t pull or pinch--and the only problem I have with it is that it somewhat loud, particularly in an enclosed shower. It charges fast and is easy to clean, plus it&#x27;s small enough that it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space on my bathroom sink. I like it!</li>
    <li> This razor is a little smaller with a little smaller handle compared to other electric razors I have used. It doesn&#x27;t have a storage case so it might not be good for travel but it will be easier to store in a shower caddy because of it&#x27;s small size.  It might not be a good idea to store the razor in the shower. I don&#x27;t see anything  that makes the razor waterproof. The charging is easy and works without having to play around with the connections. The motor does sound underpowered but the shave is close  and relatively effortless.  The wet tech works. The razor doesn&#x27;t stick on wet skin like some razors do.</li>
    <li> The Remington PR1285 rotary razor is very similar to the previous AQ7 model B00BB5YFEU and is a good choice in a rotary shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both can be used wet or dry, are comfortable in the hand, have similar blades and foils, and will give a good shave.  Both are fairly quiet and will run for about an hour between charges and have a charging stand, lithium ion batteries, and LED indicators for power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The older model feels better in the hand, in size, contour, and in the placement of the areas with a soft-touch finish.  However, the newer model has a floating head in addition to the floating blades, which makes it move more easily over the curves of the face, legs, and under the arms.  The frame that holds the blades in place is also more secure in the newer model, so the blades are less likely to fall out and be lost down the drain while rinsing.  The newer model has a flip-out trimmer that may be useful for trimming around unshaved facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with a rotary razor requires a different technique than with other types--go over the same area several times in little circles and pull the skin taut where there are tight curves or wrinkles.  Only minimal pressure is required and there is no pulling or pain. The blades don&#x27;t touch the skin, so they don&#x27;t cause micro-abrasions and the likelihood of ingrown hairs is reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being able to use this shaver in the shower with shaving gel or soap is a major advantage over versions that aren&#x27;t water resistant, because the quality of a wet shave is better than a dry shave with the same rotary shaver.</li>
    <li> I received this item at no cost from Amazon Vine program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping this would do as well as the women&#x27;s version my wife received. Sadly, it did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not shave closely without nicking skin. I have tried it wet and dry and still, the same results. It does not shave closely except for the cheek area. The rest (chin, neck, etc.) are left with stubble. I will go back to using a regular razor in order to get the clean shave I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend this to anyone looking for a nice, neat, clean shave.</li>
    <li> This is a lightweight shaver made of a not so strong plastic. It has a rubber like material down two sides of the contoured handle that helps with gripping and has the right curve to fit your hand nicely. It gives by far the closest shave I have had in a while. However when shaving it feels and sounds like the shaver head section is going to come off so that part may break on down the line. Remington suggests their “Remington FaceSaver” preshave powder to help it glide across your face. Others may find a preshave powder helpful but I am not one to buy that sort of thing. I found I could just use the shaver in a gentler fashion and still get a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a sleek stand that you can set it upright in and place it on your bathroom counter when your are not using it. You can charge it when it is in or out of the stand. Also provided are a cover for the heads and a very small brush to clean the head section.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, when I am in a hurry, I like knowing I can shave in the shower in order to save a few minutes. This shaver lets you shave in or or out of the shower. Of course shaving in the shower does require having some shaving gel on hand but the extra expense would be worth the time saved when you are busy.&lt;br /&gt;To clean the shaver you pop open the shaver head section, use the brush to clean the debris out from the head section and rinse it with water. If you are not careful the head section could be broken off since the plastic is so thin. You are not rinsing the whole shaver, just the head section. You do have to leave the head section open to dry but you can still store it in the stand. Once a week though you need to take out the heads and clean them thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer woks just as well as any other brand of shaver and it seems to be made of a little stronger plastic than head section so there should be no problem with it breaking off unless you are forceful.&lt;br /&gt;Remington did well to use a Lithium battery in this shaver. For a 90 minute charge you can shave for 60 minutes. The shaver can only be used with out the cord so there is no shaving while you charge it. So far I have found it to last me over a week and a half. One thing I like about this shaver is the 5 minute quick charge. If the battery runs low or you forget to charge it the day before you can charge it for 5 minutes and have enough power for one shave. Another cool thing is that the shaver can be used worldwide as it automatically adapts to the voltage in an outlet ranging from 100v to 2240v.&lt;br /&gt;There is a limited two-year warranty but it only covers the shaver if it has a problem due to material and workmanship. Basically if it came faulty from the manufacturer. So if the lightweight plastic breaks anywhere like where the shaver head section hinges then the user is at fault.&lt;br /&gt;I do like the performance guarantee Remington offers. Like other brands, if you are not satisfied within 30 days of your purchase, you can return it for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this shaver offers a nice shave at a reasonable price. I like the versatility of being able to shave in or or out of the shower and in other countries I may travel to. So I do recommend it with one reservation.

    <li> This is the second Remington razor I&#x27;ve had and while they have improved some small things like the flexibility of the head it&#x27;s still pretty much the exact same thing as my almost 20 year old other razor I have by them, which is part of why they are so successful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works nice and holds a charge so you can use it while you&#x27;re traveling if you need to. The reason I gave it four stars is that when you first start to use this shaver, particularly if you have sensitive skin like I do, then you&#x27;re going to have to put up with about 2-3 weeks of having razor burn pretty bad (after shave without alcohol helps but it still hurts). If you can get past that phase then it works great, which is why I still have my other 20 year old Remington shaver.</li>
    <li> Works great on my head but not on my face!</li>
    <li> Does shave as close as my previous Remington did.</li>
    <li> A few things to note about this razor - it isn&#x27;t the top of the line. It costs 60$! Many of the other reviews are taking this razor to task for things a 60$ shaver isn&#x27;t even supposed to do. This model is easy to clean, easy to use and does an adequate job. I agree with others who say it is better if you use it wet. The fact is that if you have a thick, hard to shave beard, you need to keep looking and dig a bit deeper into the wallet.&lt;br /&gt;I gave this shaver to my teenage son who loves it. It performs perfectly for him and when he goes off to college, I will most likely get him a better shaver. But for the money, this shaver does what it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> Remington shaver with some good features.  This would make a good gift for the shaver in your house with a light beard, e.g., a new shaver or one going off to college or just to get the teenager in your house from using your shaver and not cleaning it out..  It is better for use in the shower and you need some gel to get the best shave from it.  Dry it works well on a light beard but isn&#x27;t so good for a heavier one. The shape and the plastic the handle is manufactured from gives a good grip even when wet.  The charging stand has a small footprint so it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space on the counter.  Each charge is supposed to last for an hour.  This might be important to know if you intend to travel with it without the charging stand, but I would just take the stand along myself. There&#x27;s a pop up trimmer but that&#x27;s nothing special.  Your rather expect a trimmer at this price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decent rechargeable shaver</li>
    <li> My last Remington was a cordless SR9130TV which I used as an emergency shaver - something to throw in my bag when I couldn&#x27;t do a wet shave with a blade --  I&#x27;m not man enough to dry shave with a blade, pocket knife or office scissors, no matter the quality of the precision 5 blades.  I prefer to shave in the shower whenever possible - and usually with a disposable razor.  So a WetTech electric razor peaked my interest.  I run through Fusion disposables at an expensive rate - so cordless electric definitely has value if its even comparable.  I&#x27;m not a active electric user, so keep this in mind for my take on this one.  This is a plastic lightweight rotary.  Feels noticeably lighter than the older metal Remington rotary shaver - which is great, since dropping it on my feet isn&#x27;t out of the question.  The more composite materials will probably last longer in my hard water environment.  I hit it with an overnight charge and ready for a Monday trial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first experience wasn&#x27;t encouraging.  It took almost 3 times as long to get a decent shave.  I used a gel for comfort after initially just trying wet shave.  It was uncomfortable with a bit of abrasion, and I wasn&#x27;t getting very close.  I had a 1.5 day beard by then.  The gel eased the discomfort, but it took a long time to get everything reasonably close.  Reading up on it tells me that my face has to be trained.  After looking at the result in the mirror, I cleaned up with a razor and vowed to give it a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the next few days, either my ability improved with the rotary wet shave, or my face was being trained.  I continued to follow up with a razor for certain areas around my chin that don&#x27;t seem to take to rotary cuts as close.. so far.  I noticed that I&#x27;m using more shaving gel than with a razor, mostly because I&#x27;m reapplying.  The results did improve and my shaving time did reduce.  By the end of the week, I was more proficient but it didn&#x27;t replace the closeness of the Fusion 5 blade razor that I commonly use.  I think that if I really needed to cut the shaving cost down of my disposable habit, that a cordless that can be used in the shower is definitely my go to.  The Remington seems to do well in the shower, and with more use and practice, I&#x27;ll either be trained in use or my face will become smarter?  I don&#x27;t think it will replace the closeness of a razor, but I could use much less of them if I&#x27;m only using them for occasional touch up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for cleanup, I open the face of the razor after use under the shower.  It&#x27;s quick and easy and appears to be keeping it clean.  A more thorough clean may be possible with a cleaning brush, but not letting it dry up and gunk up is probably a good daily practice and the rinse under the shower head seems to do that nicely.  I still haven&#x27;t recharged the razor -- trying to see how long it lasts between charges.  But it&#x27;s lasted a week so far and that&#x27;s a good run for any daily use cordless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging stand isn&#x27;t anything to write home about.  Don&#x27;t try to charge it until its dry -- right?  But when you do, it&#x27;s nice that Remington now has smaller adapters that take less outlet space.  It&#x27;s power-strip friendly if your power-strip is  &amp;#34;stacked&amp;#34; not &amp;#34;side-by-side&amp;#34;.  Look at pictures to see what I mean.

    <li> This razor will do the job for the price, but don&#x27;t expect anything fancy or extremely high quality. It&#x27;s right where it should be for it&#x27;s price point. It shave in both wet and dry condition, although wet shaving has always been a bit more difficult with electric razors and this one is no exception. The razor is light weight, contours to the hand well, and is easy to hold even when wet. While being pretty light is a bonus, it also doesn&#x27;t feel extremely sturdy so not how long this will hold up in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power button is easy to press for one-handed shaving and the attached trimmer is easy to open and use as well. Charging is simple and quick with the charging dock, and the battery life is supposed to last pretty long on this. The flex head definitely helps when shaving around the chin and jaw as it swivels to match the pressure/angle of where you&#x27;re shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric razors I&#x27;ve used never get as close of a trim as standard razors do, and this one is pretty much the same. It still gets a pretty good trim, but, as with most electric razors, it has a more difficult time shaving if you have several days of growth and also hurts a bit as it catches hairs at angles when they&#x27;re too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a good shaver for the price point, and I&#x27;m sure it will last me for several years to come.</li>
    <li> Remington shavers under $100 are often a great deal for a few months but after that seem to fall apart or just not shave closely. This one seems to fix a few mistakes of past. For example the area underneath the head has a larger space for hair so that it doesnt get caught up in the blades faster. Additionally, instead of using a &amp;#34;S&amp;#34; type of blade portion for that part of the head, they seem to have opted for a more common design that mimics how Philips shavers have with each individual set of blades able to rotate freely in a direction of their choosing, this, in practice, made for a more smooth shaving experience. Additionally fixes is a charging stand that is more resilient to falling down, previous Remington models often had to be propped against a wall or corner to keep from falling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it works great in the dry setting and decently in the wet setting. I like the wet setting a bit more than dry shaving though both generated the same close results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really time will tell how long it can last in the long run and if it will truly last for 12 months as the promise from the company suggests.</li>
    <li> I chose this product simply because my electric razor was dying. It has three floating heads, lots of power, and comes with a cleaning brush and charger. It has no trouble tackling the short hairs (or the longer ones) and does it without causing me any pain. The heads pop off for easy cleaning. There really is not much more to say other than this razor R-O-C-K-S!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been quite a while since I have used a powered razor. It took me a long time to realize my frustration with the high prices of blades and make the leap back to the battery side. When I started working with it my old apprehensions arose once again. My hair is curly, and that includes the beard. Given a few days&#x27; head start, they turn and start to dig into my skin. At that point, an electric razor is practically useless. But used on a daily basis, a shaver like this is perfect. So that&#x27;s the routine I&#x27;ve now adopted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PR1285A R8 is lighter than I remember my old shavers being. It&#x27;s entirely waterproof, as I&#x27;ve used it in the shower several times, and is exceedingly easy to clean. Charging is easy, too, and it&#x27;s compact enough (again, it feels slightly smaller than what I&#x27;ve used in the past) that it doesn&#x27;t add clutter to the vanity. In short, it&#x27;s converted me back to the powered side, removing one of my life&#x27;s little nags, the ridiculous mark-up I faced every time I bought razors.</li>
    <li> My husband was pleased to be able to test this shaver.  He commented on how lightweight it is, and it is easy to grip/hold in your hand without slipping.  The blades flex a LOT and seem to do a good job conforming to your face, chin and neck.&lt;br /&gt;He does not like shaving in the shower, but he likes the water resistance because the shaver sits right next to the sink and occasionally gets splashed.  So there&#x27;s no need to worry when that happens.&lt;br /&gt;After shaving his face felt a bit smoother than with his old shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The only negatives he felt were the noise - it is a bit louder than his old shaver, and it did leave about the same amount of stray hairs as his old shaver.  Overall he likes it and says it does a decent job.</li>
    <li> I like this razor and it will become my primary razor because it performs good enough. I&#x27;m primarily comparing this razor to blades in the shower and a 10-year-old Norelco electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 good for quick shaving&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 performs well in the shower&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 lightweight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 shaves well in the nook of the neck&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 it has a charging stand but it can take some fiddling to make sure it&#x27;s charging correctly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 it does not shave as close as the Norelco&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 lighter weight build quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 louder but not a significant hindrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it works good it is not a Rolls-Royce but I don&#x27;t need a Rolls-Royce to get the whiskers off my face. I dropped it from about 7 feet up onto a tile floor the head popped off and one of the razor blades popped out. Nothing cracked and as able to reassemble it with no tools and it is continue to work well ever since. I share this story to say even though many people have said is build quality is not as good as Norelco it still good enough.</li>
    <li> The new Remington R8 Lithium Rotary razor gives me a fast, close, and clean shave, which is the equal of the best that I have had. Over the years, I have used electric razors manufactured by Remington, Braun, and Norelco. I have owned a [[ASIN:B00IMNLBIW Remington R5 Lithium Rotary Shaver]] for over a year. The new R8 is very similar in design to the R5 and works just as well.</li>
    <li> The Remington PR1285A WetTech Lithium Rotary shaver works quite nicely for my daily shaving. What I like about this product is its light weight and that it operates quite quietly as compared to my existing electric shaver. The shaver provides a clean cut for my light beard. The shaving heads are also easy to maintain and clean.  The water-proof feature provides an added value for shaver during the shower. One drawback with this shaver is that it does not seem to glide as smooth over my face as my other shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the Remington PR1285A WetTech Lithium Rotary shaver would be a nice shaver for in-home and travelling use.</li>
    <li> I only used this razor once, as it gave me a very poor shave. Instead of shaving my beard, it pulled on the hairs, which made me toss it aside and decide to never use it again. Plus, the shaver itself feels cheap and poorly constructed. Sorry, I just can&#x27;t recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> This Remington PR1285A R8 WetTech Lithium Rotary Shaver was given to my adult son to review.  He has been using an electrict shaver for a number of years, so is familiar with the differences between the models.  What he likes about this one is that it has a fast recharge time, easily changeable blades which last for 12 months and can be used when wet.  It was lightweight, easy to use in those tight spaces that must be shaved on men&#x27;s faces and gave a good, close shave.  All in all, it got an excellent review.</li>
    <li> In July 2014, I received my first electric shaver from the Amazon Vine Program--the Remington PR1235 R3 Power Series Rotary Shaver ([[ASIN:B00IMNLD4Y Remington PR1235 R3 Power Series Rotary Shaver, Black]]).  I fell in love with it because it gave me a quick, comfortable shave within a few minutes.  There were some drawbacks, however.  First, it didn&#x27;t give me as close a shave as my disposable razor blades.  (However, the Remington PR1235 never sliced me open.)  Also, I once told a coworker, \\&quot;I am not a drag queen; I don&#x27;t need a smooth, hairless face.\\&quot;  Furthermore, the Remington PR1235 only stayed charged for thirty minutes and took forever to re-charge (sixteen hours).  It had no quick charge function that would allow me to continue shaving in case the battery died in the middle of my shave.  I&#x27;m not the type who keeps an eye on flashing lights.  Also, I couldn&#x27;t get the Remington PR1235 wet.  This is hard to accomplish when you are shaving in the bathroom&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  A year had passed and I was still using my Remington PR1235.  It was time to buy new blades ([[ASIN:B00WD7Q0VG Remington SPR-PR Head and Cutter Assembly]]), which are nearly the price of a new low-end shaver.  Thankfully, the Amazon Vine Program sent me the Remington PR1285A R8 WetTech Lithium Rotary Shaver.  I love it even more than my Remington PR1235.  Initially, I had to charge it for twenty-four hours prior to its first usage.  Afterwards, it only needs to be charged for a mere ninety minutes.  I used the Remington PR1285A for nearly two weeks before it needed charging.  I was in the middle of my shave and I felt the shaver losing power.  Then it died.  I plugged it in for five minutes.  (I timed it with a kitchen timer.)  The shaver came to life and I had ample time to complete my shave.  I like the fact that I can use the shaver when it is wet.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about dropping it in a sink full of water and ruining it.  I have never used it in the shower because I need to view myself in the mirror while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have shaved myself when my skin was dry.  However, I get a closer shave when I use the Remington FaceSaver Pre-Shave Stick ([[ASIN:B002SO8IMS Pre-Shave Stick]]).  I&#x27;ve also received close shaves when using the Williams Lectric Shave ([[ASIN:B0013NB7DW Williams Lectric Shave, 7 Ounce]]).  I have also used shaving cream ([[ASIN:B001E5E9RK Gillette Foamy Shave Cream for Sensitive Skin, 11 oz. Bottle (Pack of 12)]]) over the sink, but it was messy.  I prefer the Williams Lectric Shave because it is easy to buy, easy to use, and very economical.  The Remington PR1285A came with its own charging base, which keeps it from rolling off my vanity.  My former one, Remington PR1235, didn&#x27;t have one and, because of its cylindrical design, it rolled onto the floor; fortunately, it didn&#x27;t break.  One must be careful to ensure that the Remington PR1285A is situated properly in its charging base.  When charging, always remember to plug the cord into the shaver first before connecting it to the electrical outlet.  When charging my iPhone, I&#x27;ve been told to do the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The Remington PR1285A R8 WetTech Lithium Rotary Shaver, Blue, is a beautiful, sleek, easy-to-hold, lightweight shaver.  I love that it gives me a close shave no matter what I put on my face: powder, liquid, cream or gel.  The shaver quickly charges so that I can always shave twice a day if I needed to do this.  An LED light lets me know when it is charging or if it needs to be charged.  But who takes the time in the morning to look at lights?  I&#x27;m glad it has a quick charge function that allows me to continue my shave if the battery dies.  This Remington PR1285A would make a wonderful gift for any man who uses an electric shaver.  [For a young man who is just beginning to shave, I would buy them the least expensive model such as the Remington PR1235 R3 Power Series Rotary Shaver ([[ASIN:B00IMNLD4Y Remington PR1235 R3 Power Series Rotary Shaver, Black]])].  Myonly suggestion for Remington is that they take this model and give it a power system that is \\&quot;cord/cordless\\&quot; so that the shaver can be used with or without the power cord.only suggestion for Remington is that they take this model and give it a power system that is \\&quot;cord/cordless\\&quot; so that the shaver can be used with or without the power cord.</li>
