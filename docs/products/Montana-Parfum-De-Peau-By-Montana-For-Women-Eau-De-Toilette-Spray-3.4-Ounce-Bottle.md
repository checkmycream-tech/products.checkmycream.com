    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume since 1989. I adore it. It is floral, warm, a bit of spice. It is the whole package. I had heard that it was being discontinued a few years ago. So far, that has been false. I cannot imagine what I would wear if I couldn;t wear this! I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I have been using Montana for years.  I am so glad that it is available on Amazon.  It is not always easy to find.  I get compliments whenever I wear it.</li>
    <li> It has been a fragrance of mine for quite a long time. I just love it and must spray myself with this amazing fragrance day and night!! Not recommended for fair skin.</li>
    <li> I use about 30 perfumes and choose only classics such as this one.  Not at all trendy so it is memorable.  I have had a bottle of this at all times in my extensive collection for years.</li>
    <li> my wife is so happy... and I won an A+ with her!!!</li>
    <li> Have loved this for years - glad to still be able to find it on Amazon cause most stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore ... a great buy!</li>

    <li> I used to wear this perfume all the time 20 years ago and than the stores around me stopped selling. Thanks to Amazon I found it again. It seems my bodysmell has changed because it doesnt smell as good as it used to on me or maybe my smell has just changed. However, happy to have bought it.</li>
    <li> I did not know this item existed until a friend told me Amazon stocks it. I love Montana ever since it came out in 1986 and will forever purchase it from you. Unlike others it is a timeless perfume for me. What I love about it more is the fact that it is the authentic original and not counterfeit. If you keep giving me the real thing I promise to be forever AMAZON customer</li>
