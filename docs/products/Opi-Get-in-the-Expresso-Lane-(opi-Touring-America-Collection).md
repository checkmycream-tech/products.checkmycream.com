<li> I was a little skeptical to order online but would definitely do it again as you can find some nice bargains even with the shipping included.</li>
<li> I decided to find a neutral dark polish this winter as an alternate to a deep red.  </li>
<li> I would say this color, despite it&#x27;s name, is a dark steel, grey rather that an &#x27;expresso&#x27; brown.</li>
<li> It arrived on time and was just what I expected.</li>
<li> The color was a little deeper than I expected</li>
<li> While I like the color that it ended up being after applied, it is almost black.</li>
<li> This color looks a little darker than the pic</li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also hard to get a solid color as the paint is very thin.</li>
<li> It goes on evenly, thick but not too thick, and wears well!</li>

    <li> love the color, gorgeous</li>
    <li> OPI is great polish and best of all it is American made product. I have several colors but this is one of my favorite colors. It&#x27;s one of those you can wear with about anything. Again it is American made so buy AMERICAN even if it&#x27;s nail polish!!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this color. I did not think such a dark color would look so nice on my nails.</li>

    <li> Great consistancy. Goes on well and covers completely in two coats. The color was a little deeper than I expected but I like it.</li>
    <li> While I like the color that it ended up being after applied, it is almost black. Not espresso.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also hard to get a solid color as the paint is very thin. I had to apply 3 coats (which is probably why it turned black).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will stick to essie.</li>
    <li> I love OPI nail polish, so it was no surprise to me that I would love my purchase..!! The color is beautiful and lasts two weeks until the next maicure..!</li>

    <li> I would say this color, despite it&#x27;s name, is a dark steel, grey rather that an &#x27;expresso&#x27; brown. But, it looks just like the model&#x27;s in the picture, where sometimes it does not. It goes on evenly, thick but not too thick, and wears well!</li>
    <li> SAME HAS PIC..SUPER FAST SHIPPING WILL ORDER AGAIN</li>
