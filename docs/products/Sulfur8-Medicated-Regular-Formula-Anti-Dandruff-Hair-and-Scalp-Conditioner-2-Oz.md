      <li>Excellent for conditioning the hair shaft before washing.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product.  </li>
      <li>My hair was growing real good</li>
      <li>Great Product, I will not use anything else at this point.</li>
      <li>Maybe it might work great for skin conditions</li>
      <li>this stuff is great.  </li>
      <li>Some nights I even apply it without blow drying (a dime sized amount will suffice) and it makes my hair feel nice without being too oily!</li>
      <li>Good stuff.</li>
      <li>this grease works good</li>
      <li>and if you have growth or scalp issues adapt a great hair regimen, eat well, exercise, love your hair, listen to your hair, gain knowledge about products and YES try sulfur 8 and monistat, by themselves or together.</li>
      <li>It is extremely effective agasinst skin conditions of the scalp.</li>
      <li>which eventually leads to more flakes throughout the week.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>and I am so glad that I did.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While it&#x27;s supposedly okay to leave it on, I use this a couple hours before showering, to avoid going around with the smell, and the pomade-y texture (think Clooney in O Brother</li>
      <li>Where Art Thou).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would&#x27;ve welcomed more product for the price, but may buy it again when I need sulfur in my regimen once more.</li>
      <li>I love Sulfur 8, I&#x27;ve been using this since u was a girl.</li>
      <li>I recommend this and plan on buying more this week.</li>
      <li>I mix sulfur 8 with kids organics gro strong (grease) triple strength and miconazole (yeast infection cream).</li>
      <li>Sulfur 8 is not a bad product, but I just can not go out with  my hair smelling like &amp;#34;the gates of hell&amp;#34;  :)</li>
      <li>The next morning my hair is still shiny and my scalp is happy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about one month and so far so good.</li>
      <li>I was told that this product would help with the itchiness from dandruff, but when I put it on I got the tingles first, like the feeling you get in your mouth after you&#x27;ve eaten a mint, then it made my scalp itch more, but now when I scratched I had grease all over my fingers.</li>
      <li>Let me shut you up right now!</li>
      <li>Thanks will be ordering more when I run out.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Maybe I&#x27;m not using it right, I don&#x27;t know</li>
      <li>I still like the product using it pretty consistently, thank you  moe.</li>
      <li>I still itched all night and the overwhelming stink was too much that I felt nauseous the next day, and no matter how much I washed my hair</li>
      <li>but I strongly feel like this product is a big reason for my growth rate increase!</li>
      <li>This formula really works.</li>
      <li>and my shedding has really dropped.</li>
      <li>My Stress Spot in my hair was really going bananas.</li>
      <li>Works very well, but does stink.  </li>
      <li>but it really works.  </li>
      <li>Nevertheless, I am pleased with the purchase and will definitely compare prices in the future.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell great if you smell straight from the jar, but once its on your hair and your hair is dry, I can hardly smell it at all, even against my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I measure at 6.5 inches which is the normal rate</li>
      <li>My daughter has thick, strong, beautiful coily hair (4b), except for this small patch in the back of her head, well thru research</li>
      <li>when I hot no complaints I increased the usage to 2xs a week, 1 after a co-wash/condition and 1 about 4 days later.</li>
      <li>so I started using Sulfur 8 and from day 1 the itch stopped and the tenderness began to suppress and so far it has been a week</li>
      <li>product delivers as expected, and the smell is definitely more tolerable than other alternatives I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I brought two jars and have used it consistently for three months and thought with all the reviews that my natural 4B hair was growing faster as I religiously oiled  my hair in braids under a wig and then later without a wig.</li>
      <li>My scalp isn&#x27;t flaky and I barely scratch my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been dealing with very intense dermatitis for over a decade by now, and sulfur products are part of my regimen about half the year.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>it is super deep conditioning--I had spent lots of money on &#x27;deep&#x27; conditioners for my dry ends.  </li>

<li> Purchased this a couple months ago and now since actually using it long enough, I can give my take on it.</li>
<li> You don&#x27;t need a lot, one jar will last you a long time.</li>
<li> It has no clear instructions...</li>
<li> After conditioning my hair, I massage sulfur8 into my scalp, and then I blow dry my hair.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve always had dry scalp</li>
<li> I do not like using the anti dandruff shampoos because they tend to make my hair excessively dry -</li>
<li> I incorporate this into my current hair regimen as well, and it has not let me down.</li>
<li> Been using for only a few days now</li>
<li> My only complaint is that I could have purchased a larger container for less at Sally&#x27;s.  </li>
<li> I was EXTREMELY cautious with my baby head/hair (this was 2 yrs ago age 3).</li>
<li> Head and Shoulders is a watered down version.</li>
<li> Now I use a peanut size on my hair past my shoulders--it tames my dry ends</li>
<li> I DO NOT have a lot of dandruff, just a little at the front of my hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> so I feel WGHO, Virgin Hair Fertilizer, rosmary oil, peppermint oil, sulfur 8, Megatek, MTG, Monistat, all that stuff was a waste of money.</li>
<li> I feel like throwing all of it away, waste of hundreds of dollars and time.</li>
<li> I really wanted this to work for me since psoriasis is a horrible condition to live with</li>
<li> Dandruff well under control and very little itching</li>
<li> Unfortunately, this is the only placve to get it.</li>
<li> but I couldnt get past the smell.</li>
<li> I use this along with Glovers as a mix, and have been using it that way for the past 2 months, and I can say I&#x27;ve seen growth.</li>
<li> Not paying attention bcz her hair stays in twist, but baaaaaaaaby with this mix her patch in about 30 days was not only long but THICK!!!!</li>
<li> it does what it supposed to though its a v. slow process.</li>
<li> Now there&#x27;s no evidence of a weak patch.</li>
<li> Ill go hard 1 month then give a break for 1 month.</li>
<li> it killed my candida problem in my hair, which was causing a bad smell.  </li>
<li> It stinks</li>
<li> but I couldnt get past the horrible smell.  </li>
<li> I had dandruff really bad.</li>
<li> And the smell is horrible too...!</li>
<li> Horrible smell.   </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Sulfur 8 is not a bad product, but I just can not go out with  my hair smelling like &amp;#34;the gates of hell&amp;#34;  :).&lt;br /&gt;I will have to just make time to go to the doctor  next time  my scalp &amp;#34;acts up&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I tried this to see if it would help with my scalp psoriasis.   I still itched all night and the overwhelming stink was too much that I felt nauseous the next day, and no matter how much I washed my hair I couldnt get the sulfur smell out.  Maybe it might work great for skin conditions but I couldnt get past the horrible smell.  It seemed to soak into my system and I couldnt stop smelling it on me all day.   Horrible smell.   I really wanted this to work for me since psoriasis is a horrible condition to live with but I couldnt get past the smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about one month and so far so good. I do not like using the anti dandruff shampoos because they tend to make my hair excessively dry - which eventually leads to more flakes throughout the week. I saw sulfur8 and decided to give it a try and I am so glad that I did. It&#x27;s helping to control dandruff and it seems to help a lot with hair growth. I also take biotin supplements but I strongly feel like this product is a big reason for my growth rate increase! After conditioning my hair, I massage sulfur8 into my scalp, and then I blow dry my hair. Some nights I even apply it without blow drying (a dime sized amount will suffice) and it makes my hair feel nice without being too oily!</li>
    <li> this stuff is great.  It doesn&#x27;t smell great if you smell straight from the jar, but once its on your hair and your hair is dry, I can hardly smell it at all, even against my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it is super deep conditioning--I had spent lots of money on &#x27;deep&#x27; conditioners for my dry ends.  I had to use 2-3 applications of them.  I put on the same amount of this stuff, and I had to go back and wash my hair!  Now I use a peanut size on my hair past my shoulders--it tames my dry ends completely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and it killed my candida problem in my hair, which was causing a bad smell.  i use it on conjunction with nizoral shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;.....................&lt;br /&gt;edit 2013: I don&#x27;t put any on my scalp, because I&#x27;ve always had an oily scalp, maybe that helps with the smell?</li>
    <li> I brought two jars and have used it consistently for three months and thought with all the reviews that my natural 4B hair was growing faster as I religiously oiled  my hair in braids under a wig and then later without a wig. I massaged and measured it and washed it every two weeks. I used to have bsl hair before my big chop one year ago. I measure at 6.5 inches which is the normal rate so I feel WGHO, Virgin Hair Fertilizer, rosmary oil, peppermint oil, sulfur 8, Megatek, MTG, Monistat, all that stuff was a waste of money. Also I took fish oil, biotin, msm, hair vitamins, gelatin, protein for months for nothing. I feel like throwing all of it away, waste of hundreds of dollars and time. Some posters have mixed hair or 2 or 3 A, B, C. I think it makes a difference. Only time helps hair growth and genes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with very intense dermatitis for over a decade by now, and sulfur products are part of my regimen about half the year.&lt;br /&gt;This product delivers as expected, and the smell is definitely more tolerable than other alternatives I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it&#x27;s supposedly okay to leave it on, I use this a couple hours before showering, to avoid going around with the smell, and the pomade-y texture (think Clooney in O Brother Where Art Thou).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would&#x27;ve welcomed more product for the price, but may buy it again when I need sulfur in my regimen once more.</li>
    <li> it does what it supposed to though its a v. slow process. I still like the product using it pretty consistently, thank you  moe.</li>
    <li> Purchased this a couple months ago and now since actually using it long enough, I can give my take on it. I absolutely love this product. Once it&#x27;s applied to my scalp, I get that immediate cooling tingly feeling and I love it. I use this along with Glovers as a mix, and have been using it that way for the past 2 months, and I can say I&#x27;ve seen growth. I incorporate this into my current hair regimen as well, and it has not let me down. I recommend this and plan on buying more this week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a while and I don&#x27;t see any difference (mind you I DO NOT have a lot of dandruff, just a little at the front of my hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;m not using it right, I don&#x27;t know</li>
    <li> It is extremely effective agasinst skin conditions of the scalp. Unfortunately, this is the only placve to get it. Head and Shoulders is a watered down version. 2-3days of teatement and the problem is gone!</li>
    <li> so greasy I had to use dish soap to wash it out</li>
    <li> My hair was growing real good then I start getting dandruff flakes flying everywhere this grease works good it stop the itch and the flakes disappeared so hopefully my hair grows back.. I have no problems with it,. Of course it will work differently on everyone hair..</li>
    <li> My Stress Spot in my hair was really going bananas. My scalp was itchy/tender and my hair was shedding. None of my organic products was working so I started using Sulfur 8 and from day 1 the itch stopped and the tenderness began to suppress and so far it has been a week and my shedding has really dropped. I put the Sulfur 8 on my scalp at night and massage it thru my hair and put on a silk bonnet. The next morning my hair is still shiny and my scalp is happy. Great Product, I will not use anything else at this point.</li>
    <li> Been using for only a few days now and I already see a big difference. My scalp isn&#x27;t flaky and I barely scratch my hair. This formula really works. Take it from me I had dandruff really bad. Thanks will be ordering more when I run out.</li>
    <li> I mix sulfur 8 with kids organics gro strong (grease) triple strength and miconazole (yeast infection cream). Don&#x27;t clutch your pearls yes coochie cream lol! Let me shut you up right now! My daughter has thick, strong, beautiful coily hair (4b), except for this small patch in the back of her head, well thru research I heard about monistat and though eyebrows raised but those who tried it swore by it. I was EXTREMELY cautious with my baby head/hair (this was 2 yrs ago age 3). I watched for all the warnings i.e. headaches etc. when I hot no complaints I increased the usage to 2xs a week, 1 after a co-wash/condition and 1 about 4 days later. Not paying attention bcz her hair stays in twist, but baaaaaaaaby with this mix her patch in about 30 days was not only long but THICK!!!! Now there&#x27;s no evidence of a weak patch. I was amazed! I blv the sufur 8 and monistat worked it out like a champ! I continue to use it and yes hers &amp; my hair have thickened and flourished also in length. I use it sparingly. Ill go hard 1 month then give a break for 1 month. YT, blog, google the benefits of both and if you have growth or scalp issues adapt a great hair regimen, eat well, exercise, love your hair, listen to your hair, gain knowledge about products and YES try sulfur 8 and monistat, by themselves or together. I&#x27;m a believer!!!</li>
    <li> This ointment has been around for years. I used this stuff on my scalp for dandruff issues and it works</li>
    <li> Works very well, but does stink.  Dandruff well under control and very little itching</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Works as well today as it did when I was a child.  Excellent for conditioning the hair shaft before washing.  My only complaint is that I could have purchased a larger container for less at Sally&#x27;s.  Nevertheless, I am pleased with the purchase and will definitely compare prices in the future.</li>
    <li> I love Sulfur 8, I&#x27;ve been using this since u was a girl. I&#x27;ve always had dry scalp and I now have scalp psoriasis. This is the only product that immediately relieves itching, and keeps it away too. You don&#x27;t need a lot, one jar will last you a long time. It also gets rid of the flakes. It definitely smells medicated, but I&#x27;ve just gotten used to it. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Leaves the hair horrible,it is not a conditioner! It has no clear instructions...it says only &amp;#34;apply 2 or 3 times a day on the affected area! So it is not a conditioner,when you try to rinse it off ,you just can&#x27;t, you have to wash your hair again! And the smell is horrible too...!</li>
    <li> excellent product for your hair and scalp</li>
    <li> Good stuff. It stinks but it really works.  I have been using this product every since I was A Kid.</li>
    <li> I was told that this product would help with the itchiness from dandruff, but when I put it on I got the tingles first, like the feeling you get in your mouth after you&#x27;ve eaten a mint, then it made my scalp itch more, but now when I scratched I had grease all over my fingers.</li>
