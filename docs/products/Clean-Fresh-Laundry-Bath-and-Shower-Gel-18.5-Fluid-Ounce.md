      <li>It&#x27;s very nice - don&#x27;t get me wrong - but if you are looking for something to layer your body with, I don&#x27;t think this is going to do the trick.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>

    <li> Received this order in for the holidays!</li>
    <li> Item was from another discount house.  It had been opened but plastic protector was present.  Even though. it is wrong to say it was new it did appear to.be ok.  Shipping was fine.  Watch out. ASK QUESTIONS.</li>
    <li> i love the the clean product line. it smells super fresh and last for most of the day. I give it a thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I just love this! It smells so clean and fresh and isn&#x27;t too overpowering. I definitely recommend this shower gel. You won&#x27;t regret your purchase!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite things to use you feel clean and fresh with a very soft smell all around you</li>
    <li> This soap smells sooo good and does make you feel clean.  I do use a shower puff but, I had to use lots to make enough suds.  I really like it!</li>
    <li> It is so CLEAN AND FRESH....I WORK IN A HOSPITAL AND IT IS  CLEAN AND FRESH AND EVEN LIGHT ENOUGH TO WEAR AT MY JOB. EVERY ONE LOVES IT! !!! I GET COMPLIMENTS ALLLLL DAYYYY LONGGG!!&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE THE WARM COTTON PURFUME AND JUST ORDERED THE FRESH LAUNDRY PURFUME. THE FRAGRANCE IS SO SOFT AND LIGHT BUT HAS A BOLD LASTING SCENT.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product. I wished it suds more.</li>
    <li> I love it.  That&#x27;s all I shower with.&lt;br /&gt;Cool and refreshing all day.&lt;br /&gt;A big thumbs up!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The scent is SIMILAR to the perfume, but not spot on. It&#x27;s very nice - don&#x27;t get me wrong - but if you are looking for something to layer your body with, I don&#x27;t think this is going to do the trick.</li>
    <li> Love the fresh clean scent</li>
    <li> I like to smell clean and refreshing after a shower and this does the trick. Great refreshing body wash.  Follow up with the lotion and perfume of the same scent after. The combo of the three isnt overwhelming and I get alot of compliments on how great this smells~</li>
    <li> Little overpriced but smells great.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this, but not so much.  It doesn&#x27;t suds up very well and although it smells nice coming out of the bottle the scent doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this, I favor casual, low key scents. I bought the body wash, lotion and cologne, layering usually creates the best effect. Half an hour after I was through, nothing remained I could detect. I asked a friend who has sniffing privileges , she couldn&#x27;t smell anything either. That&#x27;s a lot of money to pay, for not even smelling as good as Gain washed clothes! My bad for buying more than one product without seeing if it lasted. The body wash and lotion are ok, I will just try not to think what I payed for it.</li>
    <li> Good service from seller and it arrived well packaged and in a week or so. I read the reviews from multiple sites, but this was not what I expected. Very flowery, institutional, restroom smelling soap. Fortunately, it doesn&#x27;t last very long. I gave it to my daughter, but I don&#x27;t think she likes it either.</li>
    <li> The clean products have the freshest scent that last all day.  I get many compliments about the scent.  I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this because I have used the Fresh Laundry perfume for years and wanted a set but this is very lightly scented and it does not suds much at all.  I have to use a lot to get any suds at all and if I didn&#x27;t already know what the scent was I would think this was something else entirely. I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
