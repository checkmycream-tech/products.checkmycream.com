      <li>Great buy.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
      <li>This moisturizer does feel like it contains vitamin C, it tingles pleasantly when applied.</li>

      <li>Made my skin have even tone, which was nice.</li>
      <li>It smells nice</li>
      <li>but it does smell nice and</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t find this moisturizer to be particularly effective.</li>
      <li>Smells nice</li>
      <li>For all natural moisturizers the price and quality are superb.</li>
      <li>The smell is wonderful, it covers light and clean, and it does seem to brighten your face a bit after you first apply it.</li>
      <li>I love and have tried all of the</li>
      <li>my skin tone looks more even after using this product for about 3 weeks.</li>
      <li>Make sure you look at what your skin needs.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t pay more if you don&#x27;t have too.</li>
      <li>It was okay...</li>
      <li>I prefer the carrot version, though, because it smells better and is a bit more moisturizing.</li>
      <li>It feels nice and light.</li>
      <li>Purchased even more things from this line. :)</li>
      <li>I love all three.</li>
      <li>Many dermatologists or cosmetologists will tell you to use nothing lower than an SPF 30 when using vitamin C on your skin.</li>
      <li>It also smells lovely, like a grapefruit with a bit of sugar sprinkled on top.</li>
      <li>I really love this moisturizer/sun-block.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>This worked ok</li>
      <li>It makes your skin more reactive to the sun.</li>
      <li>I like the smell too :)</li>
      <li>Love that it&#x27;s made of mineral sunscreens.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love that is minimizes my pores, thus making my skin look smoother and more even toned.</li>
      <li>The combination of these two products makes my skin tone much more even.  </li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer, I just do.</li>
      <li>I really wanted a moisturizer with SPF in it, and this seemed like a good option.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried their other lines (blueberries &amp; cucumber) and wasn&#x27;t very impressed.</li>
      <li>For reference, I have very fair and sensitive skin, and I have combination/oily skin but rarely have pimples.  </li>
      <li>It makes my makeup break of crease really easy</li>
      <li>con: Strong floral smell that wears off eventually but returns when wet/washing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not impossible to apply, but not as easy as most of the</li>
      <li>It would probably be OK for people with oilier skin or in the summer on very hot days.</li>
      <li>And I can envision myself using it for the rest of my life, bar any huge ingredient or price changes.</li>
      <li>Really light - doesn&#x27;t feel oily.</li>
      <li>it costs astronomically more, but is totally worth it in my opinion.</li>
      <li>To Grapefruit Correct and Repair CC Cream (Lightly Tinted)</li>
      <li>Goes on light.</li>
      <li>I love that it has sunscreen, though I would prefer if a higher spf were available.</li>
      <li>what moisturizers are really supposed to do:)</li>
      <li>A better scent would be much appreciated.  </li>
      <li>and it last many, many months.</li>
      <li>have very sensitive skin and am allergic to chemicals put into most beauty products now and days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Feels great on the skin, but smells a little too powdery and old-lady-ish.  </li>
      <li>so I was hoping for more natural ingredients throughout.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use this as my only sunscreen, but it&#x27;s good for putting on in the morning or touching up before going our in the middle of the day.    </li>
      <li>I first purchased the facial wipes and was impressed with how smooth my skin was and the slight glow it had.</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;m sure the spf helps to prevent future damage that can happen from UVA rays.</li>
      <li>The results have been nothing short of phenomenal.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of like a bitter fruit smell.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s 95% all natural and paraben free.</li>
      <li>Really good for sensitive skin and helps it stay clear, keep clear and not get sun burnt.</li>
      <li>A clear airless pump bottle for the Even Skin Tone Moisturizer (as opposed to the opaque white one that it comes in) would be ideal; the CC cream is already in a clear bottle, and it is much easier to see how much product is left.  </li>
      <li>The SPF is not high, I wish they had a SPF 30 or more version, but probably would be sticky...</li>
      <li>It feels like something in it isn&#x27;t absorbing</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have any real problems with this product, but I am used to using a heavier moisturizer year-round on my skin, and this just didn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
      <li>Also the scent is not one of my favs (unlike the Yes to tomatoes, much I like) -- it smells like narcissus flower which I do not care for.</li>
      <li>Could be the heightened sense of smell thanks to pregnancy though.</li>
      <li>That said, this product was much kinder to my skin in that respect.</li>
      <li>dryness is kind of a plus for the recent heatwave here in NY, but when the temperature goes back below 90 again, I&#x27;ll need a real moisturizer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very well priced.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any &#x27;correction&#x27; to my skin, but I didn&#x27;t really buy it for that.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t like the smell of this at all, so much that I had to wash it off.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a much cheaper alternative to the my murad anti-aging spf cream and stumbled upon this because I use Yes to tomatoes for my evening face cream.</li>
      <li>It also felt really greasy.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for my sensitive skin that is allergic to chemical sunscreens and it has almost no white caste like other physical sunblocks.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it actually reduces bright spots, but my skin definitely looks more even after about 60 days of use.</li>
      <li>Being pregnant, I have spent alot of time looking for cleaner products to put on my skin (absorbed into the bloodstream just as if you ate it).</li>
      <li>some dark spot I had on my chin looks lighter and blends into skin more.</li>
      <li>My main concerns were that I had never found a product with sunscreen that a) didn&#x27;t burn my eyes by the end of the day,</li>
      <li>Although the light grapefruit citrusy fragrence was OK, the lotion gave my sensitive facial skin little bumps.</li>
      <li>But applying foundation over the top leave streaks and a mess.</li>
      <li>But the formulation is super thick and not so easy to apply-</li>
      <li>I use it lightly once every other day before I go out.</li>
      <li>This is my new go-to.</li>
      <li>all, I recommend finding another tinted moisturizer, particularly to those who are frequently exposed to the sun,and those with freckles and age spots.</li>

    <li> This stuff is amazing! I got a freaking acne beard for my 17th birthday, it was horrible having to hid my face freshman year of college. BLEH! Anyway I picked my face, I later learned it was a damaging habit. After a year, I finally started clearing up but I now just had a scared looking beard. I went to the demonologist but nothing worked &lt;--I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to chemicals put into most beauty products now and days.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this product, I had heard citrus fruits were helpful for scaring. Within 2 days of putting this on in the morning and spending the day in the sun, I had already seen results. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and recommend it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> but it does smell nice and I like that it has sunscreen in it.  It seems to be a good moisturizer but I&#x27;m not sure it does much to even skin tone.</li>
    <li> Smells nice I don&#x27;t think I have been using long enough to give a full reveiw, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the spf on the moisturizer but I feel it might be to heavy for my skin type Anyway.</li>
    <li> Love that it&#x27;s made of mineral sunscreens. Goes on light. I wear it under my make-up daily. Have not had an skin issues with it. This is my second bottle. I plan to keep buying items from this line.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  I use it with other YES products depending on my skins needs.  Make sure you look at what your skin needs.  This is ideal for erasing or preventing age spots.  I love it during the Summer, when I&#x27;m spending a great deal of time in the sun.  It doesn&#x27;t contain parabens. It&#x27;s also very well priced.  Don&#x27;t pay more if you don&#x27;t have too.</li>
    <li> I love this product. At first when you put in on, the moisturizer feela thin but within seconds you can feel it drench your skin and it absorbs quickly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sun spots that have been fading and my skin tone looks more even after using this product for about 3 weeks. It&#x27;s 95% all natural and paraben free. Can&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
    <li> I agree with other reviewers that this product has a strange consistency. It&#x27;s pasty and doesn&#x27;t seem moisturizing at all. It feels like one of those heavy-duty oil-free sports sunbolcks for a day at the beach... except with those at least you get 45-75 spf. I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my freckles / sun spots either. I&#x27;ve been using it because I don&#x27;t want to waste it and it&#x27;s dryness is kind of a plus for the recent heatwave here in NY, but when the temperature goes back below 90 again, I&#x27;ll need a real moisturizer.</li>
    <li> What I like most about this lotion is that a few dark spots I had on my face have lightened after about 1 month of use.  That makes me very happy!  It&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs nicely.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the scent (I think it stinks!) and this bottle is so small - it only last me about 1 month (using 1-2 pumps per day).  Overall, I would keep buying to see the dark spots continue to fade.</li>
    <li> This is my new go-to. For all natural moisturizers the price and quality are superb. Although it may seem like not a lot of product for the price, you only use about half a pump each application and it last many, many months. The smell is wonderful, it covers light and clean, and it does seem to brighten your face a bit after you first apply it. I can&#x27;t say that it brightens your face/corrects and repairs spots long term because I haven&#x27;t seen a difference after about 8-9 months, but I like it for what moisturizers are really supposed to do:) Not sure any moisturizer without some serious ingredients like active manuka honey or something like that could really change your face if it is already damaged. However, I&#x27;m sure the spf helps to prevent future damage that can happen from UVA rays.</li>
    <li> I really love this moisturizer/sun-block. Perfect for my sensitive skin that is allergic to chemical sunscreens and it has almost no white caste like other physical sunblocks. It does start out with a little bit of a weird grapefruit medicinal smell, but it goes away very quickly. Highly recommend for sensitive skin. I haven&#x27;t noticed any &#x27;correction&#x27; to my skin, but I didn&#x27;t really buy it for that.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have any real problems with this product, but I am used to using a heavier moisturizer year-round on my skin, and this just didn&#x27;t cut it. I usually had to apply a second type of moisturizer after using it. It would probably be OK for people with oilier skin or in the summer on very hot days.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer, I just do. I love that is minimizes my pores, thus making my skin look smoother and more even toned. I love that it has sunscreen, though I would prefer if a higher spf were available. I have very sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother my face. I also happen to love that this product, along with other other products in this brand, use mostly natural ingredients. If given a choice, I try to use natural products. I&#x27;ve used other moisturizers which did a better job of shrinking/hiding my pores but with my sensitive skin, I can&#x27;t use other brands.&lt;br /&gt;Just the same, I won&#x27;t go outside without wearing this. I&#x27;m a happy repeat costumer!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for maybe a month? I think it works, some dark spot I had on my chin looks lighter and blends into skin more. I like the smell too :)</li>
    <li> Great lotion! Really good for sensitive skin and helps it stay clear, keep clear and not get sun burnt. I use it lightly once every other day before I go out. My skin is softer, brighter, and the bottle lasts a while since you don&#x27;t need to use a lot, even just for simple moisturizing. Love it!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find this moisturizer to be particularly effective. For me, I felt like I had to reapply half way through the day and I found the smell to be similar to bug spray. I used roughly 1/3 of it and was saving it as a back up but eventually threw it away. I like other &amp;#34;Yes to: products but was not a fan of this one.</li>
    <li> Smells pretty awful, but it works great. A little goes a long way. Seriously. I prefer the carrot version, though, because it smells better and is a bit more moisturizing. It does even the skin tone, though, so it wasn&#x27;t a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin very oily (and I normally have dry skin)and doesn&#x27;t really absorb in well. Plus the smell isn&#x27;t great. It&#x27;s kind of like a bitter fruit smell. It makes my makeup break of crease really easy and I&#x27;m not a fan of SPF in my moisturizer. I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> About what I have to say is in the headline. I was looking for a much cheaper alternative to the my murad anti-aging spf cream and stumbled upon this because I use Yes to tomatoes for my evening face cream. I have combination skin and it does not moisturize the dry area of my face very well. Also the scent is not one of my favs (unlike the Yes to tomatoes, much I like) -- it smells like narcissus flower which I do not care for. The scent does go away (I think, or I get used to it) but I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> This lotion did not work for me for two reasons. It had a pasty consistency and did not not absorb well so I could not use it long enough to see how it would affect the skin tone. When a product does not work for my face I often keep it to use it as a hand moisturizer but the smell on this one is so obnoxious that I had to throw it away. Smells like gasoline, only worse.</li>
    <li> Really light - doesn&#x27;t feel oily. I wouldn&#x27;t use this as my only sunscreen, but it&#x27;s good for putting on in the morning or touching up before going our in the middle of the day.    I&#x27;m not sure if it actually reduces bright spots, but my skin definitely looks more even after about 60 days of use.</li>
    <li> Check out the ingredients on this box, then check the blueberries, cucumber etc.&lt;br /&gt;I say this because you will find the same ingredients in every box, just differently labeled!!!!</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t like the smell of this at all, so much that I had to wash it off.  I was expecting a bright citrus smell but not the case.  It also felt really greasy.  I swapped back to the Yes to Cucumbers.</li>
    <li> I think it smells horrible. The Yes to Grapefruit face-wash smell is wonderful so I thought this would be too. Not the case. I also am not impressed with the consistency. It is not creamy and does not spread well. I will definitely not buy it again and will probably end up chucking it before using it up.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3-4 months. This moisturizer does feel like it contains vitamin C, it tingles pleasantly when applied. I like the scent. For these reasons, I purchased it a second time.  had used Aveeno day lotion for years, but had to admit to myself that my skin is too oily for it. That said, this product was much kinder to my skin in that respect. I have had less breakouts. It is BARELY a moisturizer though. It leaves what feels like a film on my skin. It feels like something in it isn&#x27;t absorbing fully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SPF, as other reviewers pointed out, is not high enough. SPF 15 isn&#x27;t high enough in a normal foundation, in my opinion, and this is not a normal foundation. As I said before, it definitely contains vitamin C. Many dermatologists or cosmetologists will tell you to use nothing lower than an SPF 30 when using vitamin C on your skin. It makes your skin more reactive to the sun. I was using an SPF 30 powder foundation over this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I recommend finding another tinted moisturizer, particularly to those who are frequently exposed to the sun,and those with freckles and age spots.</li>
    <li> I first purchased the facial wipes and was impressed with how smooth my skin was and the slight glow it had. I decided to buy this moisturizer and it is awesome. I have very sensitive combination skin. No breakouts from this product and it looks like I have make-up on all the time (in a good way). I have some scarring on my face and it does seem less obvious but only time will tell with those. Every once in awhile you come across a product that actually works with instant results and this is one of those. I&#x27;ve tried their other lines (blueberries &amp; cucumber) and wasn&#x27;t very impressed.</li>
    <li> I did not care for this. I use and saw results with the Grapefruit serum, Grapefruit face wipes and the Grapefruit body cream. I love all three. This does not smell the same. It goes on white but soaks in within seconds. I will finish it up without make-up. But applying foundation over the top leave streaks and a mess.</li>
    <li> This does help block the sun and keep my freckles from \\&quot;popping out\\&quot; the day after sun exposure. It also smells lovely, like a grapefruit with a bit of sugar sprinkled on top. But the formulation is super thick and not so easy to apply- My skin isn&#x27;t drier at the end of the day than in the winter when I was using Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Day Cream, but I&#x27;m always a bit skeptical about how well it hydrates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a natural ginger, so I can&#x27;t tell if this may have a weird, lightish look on some skintones. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference but that&#x27;s not saying a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still on the fence as to if I&#x27;ll buy this again, I may try a different Yes To day cream with SPF instead. The formula is just a bit difficult to work with. It&#x27;s not impossible to apply, but not as easy as most of the Yes To products I&#x27;ve tried. Almost like a gel instead of a cream.</li>
    <li> Feels great on the skin, but smells a little too powdery and old-lady-ish.  I like this company and will use their products in the future, but was unhappy with the scent of this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> It dries well on my skin and doesnt leave a sticky sensation. The SPF is not high, I wish they had a SPF 30 or more version, but probably would be sticky... I use it in days when I know I will be indoors all the time. When I know I will be outdoors in certain times or for long, I use another brand.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer does make my face soft and it does get rid of the dark spots, I just wish it prevent my nose from flaking that&#x27;s all</li>
    <li> I have tried many products some of which are expensive.  I have never gotten a compliment until today.  The product is a sunscreen and moisturizer.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at a deep discount from the official Yes To Carrots website - but I rely heavily on Amazon reviews when purchasing items at any website online, so I figured I&#x27;d give back!  For reference, I have very fair and sensitive skin, and I have combination/oily skin but rarely have pimples.  I was looking for either sunscreen or a moisturizer with SPF that I could wear every day.  I don&#x27;t usually wear makeup, so your results may vary if you try to apply makeup on top of this SPF moisturizer.  My main concerns were that I had never found a product with sunscreen that a) didn&#x27;t burn my eyes by the end of the day, b) didn&#x27;t make my face look like an oil slick, and c) didn&#x27;t smell like the traditional sunscreen (that smell gives me a massive headache for some unknown reason).  I believe the burning sensation in other products I tried until now was due to chemical as opposed to physical sun blockers, as well as any added scent.  Cue the Yes To Grapefruit Correct and Repair Even Skin Tone Moisturiser SPF 15, with only physical sun blockers (zinc and titanium dioxides) (though it does have added fragrance)!  I have been using the Yes To Grapefruit Correct and Repair Even Skin Tone Moisturizer SPF 15 for several months now.  I have only used it mixed in conjunction with an equal part of the Yes To Grapefruit Correct and Repair CC Cream (Lightly Tinted) (ASIN: B00D42C9IC).  The moisturizer is white, and the CC cream is colored - I mixed both so that I wouldn&#x27;t get a white cast, or have colored streaks like some foundations or CC creams leave.  The results have been nothing short of phenomenal.  The combination of these two products makes my skin tone much more even.  They also have a mattifying effect &#x3D; much less oily face, which lasts almost the whole day!   It is quickly absorbed and does not feel heavy, so there is no chance for the product to creep into my eyes throughout the day, and I have had zero problems with any eye irritation.    Win, win, and win.I also appreciate the natural ingredients, namely extracts and oils.  Additionally, my research on PubMed suggests there may be a role for topical zinc application not only as sunblock, but also as a skin clearing agent in therapeutic dermatology due to its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects, as well as its role in sebum reduction.  And the airless pump bottle is an added bonus.  There are two *minor* changes I would suggest: 1) The scent is pretty awful.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is to do with the natural ingredients, or the added fragrance.  A better scent would be much appreciated.  However, this is not a dealbreaker for me, as the scent disappears completely after about 15-20min from application.  And it definitely doesn&#x27;t smell like a stereotypical sunscreen you&#x27;d buy at the drugstore, which is great for me.  2) A clear airless pump bottle for the Even Skin Tone Moisturizer (as opposed to the opaque white one that it comes in) would be ideal; the CC cream is already in a clear bottle, and it is much easier to see how much product is left.  That said, I am 100% sold on the Yes To Grapefruit Correct and Repair SPF line.  And I can envision myself using it for the rest of my life, bar any huge ingredient or price changes.</li>
    <li> This worked ok but I wasn&#x27;t sold on the consistency. It is a bit gluggy. There are all still some chemicals in this product so I was hoping for more natural ingredients throughout.</li>
    <li> I like the odour, the sensation on my skin and everything on Yes to products. I also can see the results of using natural things on my skin instead of using the other brands products (full of chemical products inside)</li>
    <li> LOVE!!! all Say Yes products!!</li>
    <li> Although the light grapefruit citrusy fragrence was OK, the lotion gave my sensitive facial skin little bumps. Maybe it&#x27;s the zinc sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I have skin that&#x27;s oily and acne-prone, but also on the sensitive side. I really wanted a moisturizer with SPF in it, and this seemed like a good option. It was okay... but it was very heavy on my skin, and it&#x27;s waaaaay too expensive to just be &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;, you know what I&#x27;m saying? I&#x27;m in college, I can&#x27;t afford to shell out 16 bucks for something that I dislike.</li>
    <li> i have been using this moisturizer for a few months now and can solidly say that it&#x27;s just ok. i was initially drawn to it because i like many of the other products in the yes to line, and it seemed like an affordable option for a mostly natural moisturizer with SPF. the scent never bothered me as i actually love grapefruit, and i never experienced any bad reactions despite having sensitive skin. my main gripe, though, is that it never really provided enough moisture, which is kind of crucial since it&#x27;s a moisturizer. it left my skin dull and dry in some spots, and over oily in others in reaction to not getting the proper oils it needed to stay balanced. I recently upgraded to dr. hauschka quince day cream and WOAH what a difference. it costs astronomically more, but is totally worth it in my opinion. unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t seem like you can skimp on cost if you&#x27;re looking for a truly natural, truly effective skin care product.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and it makes my face glowy...hasn&#x27;t taken away my brown spots but they have faded a little. Will continue to use this and other Yes To products.</li>
    <li> I thought the comments on the strong bad smell were exaggerated. They weren&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Made my skin have even tone, which was nice. However it dries out my skin. Also, contains aluminum which is something I avoid in my food and skincare products.</li>
    <li> I love and have tried all of the Yes To products.  This one is a miss for me.  It smells nice and I love the fact that is has the SPF, but the texture is PASTY and it goes on very white, which is not a good look on the face unless you want that zinc oxide look. I&#x27;ll use this for the kids, rather than throw it away.  They don&#x27;t mind looking like ghosts. :)  I&#x27;m sticking with the Yes to Carrots with SPF 15!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m of mixed heritage so I have pink and yellow under tones and am very prone to hyper pigmentation : which on a pale girl  with the ability to tan ... Doesn&#x27;t look so great. This product  is working  I&#x27;ve noticed  my sun Damage  has started to soften up and. The natural formula. Doesn&#x27;t make me pink, greasy or  give me break outs as a result I&#x27;ve. Purchased even more things from this line. :)</li>
    <li> I like this lotion. It is one of the few lotions that I can put on my face without breaking out. It feels nice and light. Even my husband likes it. We both really appreciate that it has no harmful or questionable ingredients. Being pregnant, I have spent alot of time looking for cleaner products to put on my skin (absorbed into the bloodstream just as if you ate it). This company impresses me with the quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;Only con: Strong floral smell that wears off eventually but returns when wet/washing. Could be the heightened sense of smell thanks to pregnancy though.</li>
