      <li>Love this product and don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s not being carried anymore?</li>
      <li>The product i love.  </li>
      <li>Maybe more than 10.</li>
      <li>Wood like to find more of it available.</li>
      <li>Always works best for me and keeps my eyes wet</li>
      <li>Whenever I had to use Renu or Opti Free, I would appreciate how moisturizing Aquify was.</li>
      <li>but so far there is none out there that is as good as Aquify</li>
      <li>It keeps my contacts clean and fresh, and most importantly, moist throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>I have an astigmatism in one eye, and so wear special contacts.</li>
      <li>I do clean my lens over night but also wanted the convenience of a quick clean if needed.</li>
      <li>every day I put on the lenses - it is better than straight out of the box.  </li>
      <li>I was happy to find it on Amazon and it is the same good contact lense solution I have enjoyed using in the past.</li>
      <li>I live in Australia and was horrified to receive a communication from my optometrist to advise that this product is being withdrawn from the market in 2014.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it overseas in Europe and here for many</li>
      <li>have thrown away a lot of money trying other solutions and this is the only one that I can use.&lt;br /&gt;Please all loyal Aquify MPS users spread the word on this so that this brilliant product continues to be available to all of us!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have tried every saline out there for my soft contacts and I love this.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product and hard to find.</li>
      <li>am aware that Ciba Vision have merged or been bought over by Alcon but that should not prevent them from continuing to sell this product.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many different lens cleaning products, but none work as well as Aquify.</li>
      <li>My eyes feel so much better when I use this solution, and my disposable contacts last longer when I use this.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>There are many like me who are willing to pay extra.</li>
      <li>Gave this is as a gift to my friend and he absolutely loves it!  </li>
      <li>I currently wear Air Optix Night &amp; Day lenses and this stuff is fantastic if they need a quick cleaning.  </li>
      <li>I really wish they weren&#x27;t discontinuing it.</li>
      <li>It moisturizes really well allowing me to wear my contacts all day.</li>
      <li>The other cleaners seem to work OK for the standard lens, but Aquify is the only product that keeps my astigmatism lens clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Great product at an expensive price.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing contacts for 8 years or so now, and I quickly learned that most solutions either made my eyes burn or made the get dry after a few hours.</li>
      <li>I bought new contact lenses and i followed all the instructions, but now my contacts are ruined and this product burns like tapatio to the eyes.</li>
      <li>anyone wondering what to try after you can&#x27;t find it anymore, I highly recommend Clear Care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Have</li>
      <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
      <li>I was surprised that Walgreens no longer carry them, nor CVS.  </li>
      <li>Maybe I just have sensitive eyes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve searched all the supermarkets near me and can&#x27;t find it anymore.</li>
      <li>Its the only one in the market I&#x27;ve found that really suits my eyes.</li>
      <li>I will continue to purchase the Aquify solution via Amazon for as long as I can, and not think about the replacement solution until I absolutely need to.</li>
      <li>The only solution I have found over the last several years that allows me to comfortably wear my contacts all day long.</li>
      <li>Based on other reviews though, it looks like Aquify has worked for a higher percentage of the people that have tried it.</li>
      <li>Aquify in my opinion, is the best solution out there other than Clear Care (which never makes my contacts dry out but does burn occasionally).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sad to learn it was being discontinued, so I bought a few boxes here before it&#x27;s gone for good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>After the initial learning curve, the biggest annoyance was the first fifteen minutes to half hour after putting the contact in.</li>
      <li>fact that they&#x27;re discontinuing this is going to make me seriously consider LASIK as there is no other product on the market that I know of that can clean lenses as well as Aquify in such a short amount of time.</li>
      <li>I found this on the the Military base for $8 and this is the only size that they carry, which makes it an excellent value even here on Amazon compared to the single bottle.</li>

<li> I have tried almost all the other brands, and they are not the same.</li>
<li> and it is getting hard to find where i live, thank goodness for amazons web deals</li>
<li> I tried 2 other brands (Biotrue and renu) before using Aquify.</li>
<li> None of the other solutions worked for me - after a couple of days, I would feel contacts get cloudy and would irritate my eyes.  </li>
<li> Customers have claimed those other brands that didn&#x27;t work for me did work for them.</li>
<li> I have narrowed it down to this due to the 5 minute minimum cleaning time, how well it cleans and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
<li> over the period time though this solution have got expensive, is it because of the high demand ?</li>
<li> I basically spray em down with this, rub them for a few seconds, and throw them in the case for 15-20 minutes</li>
<li> My 2 bottles came with long expiration dates &amp; were MUCH less expensive than local retail stores.</li>
<li> why is this not available anywhere else ?</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to find in stores now</li>

    <li> This is mine and my daughter&#x27;s favorite contact solution, stores in this area are not carrying it any longer. It was as described and  I will order it again...</li>
    <li> This contact lens solution is my favorite from all of them.  It keeps my contacts clean and fresh, and most importantly, moist throughout the day.  The only downside is that unlike other solutions, when it drips on the counter, this one is sticky when it dries.</li>

    <li> Great product at an expensive price.  I wish the shipping cost was cheaper but I understand supply and demand.  This is a great product and hard to find.</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;m not allergic to it. I like the extra travel bottle and the extra nighttime case for your contacts.</li>
    <li> i love this stuff! and it is getting hard to find where i live, thank goodness for amazons web deals</li>
    <li> excellent for my sensitive eyes. Don&#x27;t understand why they quit making it. Wood like to find more of it available.</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous! I remove my contacts almost every night to give my eyes a rest, especially having worn contacts for 25 years. I&#x27;ve tried lots of solutions over the years when introduced to them by my Opthamologist. This solution makes my lens feel so comfortable! When area local stores stopped carrying Aquify, I turned to Amazon. My 2 bottles came with long expiration dates &amp; were MUCH less expensive than local retail stores. I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this product again from the same vendor!</li>
    <li> it works, it is the only one that does for me...so why was it discontinued.?..I am trying to find another contact solution...but so far there is none out there that is as good as Aquify</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a great price. The price has dropped since I bought it (under $24 at time of this review). I bought it for $27. I&#x27;ve only been wearing contacts for 2 years now and only in one eye. After the initial learning curve, the biggest annoyance was the first fifteen minutes to half hour after putting the contact in. My eye would almost always burn and go red. I tried 2 other brands (Biotrue and renu) before using Aquify. So glad I found Aquify. The other two both burned my eye (or failed to remove whatever it is that burns my eye).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product claims to disinfect in 5 mins and no burning eye for me. I highly recommend this product. The fact that it comes with a travel sized container is an added bonus. I travel a lot and prefer not to check a bag in for shorter trips - so I own a travel sized version of everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this is different from person to person. Customers have claimed those other brands that didn&#x27;t work for me did work for them. Maybe I just have sensitive eyes. Based on other reviews though, it looks like Aquify has worked for a higher percentage of the people that have tried it. Give it a shot!</li>
    <li> Am so happy that I could get this on Amazon. I&#x27;ve searched all the supermarkets near me and can&#x27;t find it anymore. This is the only solution that does not burn my eyes when I put my contacts in and cleans the lens well. Love this product and don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s not being carried anymore? I hope Amazon continues!!!!</li>
    <li> This is, by far, the best contact lens solution. Unfortunately, the company has stopped making it. (Who made this crazy decision?) I&#x27;ll keep ordering it from Amazon until they don&#x27;t have any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone knows a product that is as good as Aquify, please let us know. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I just found out that this solution has been discontinued so I bought 2 bottles.  I&#x27;ve tried almost every solution out there in the 15 years I&#x27;ve worn contacts and this is by far the best.  I currently wear Air Optix Night &amp; Day lenses and this stuff is fantastic if they need a quick cleaning.  I basically spray em down with this, rub them for a few seconds, and throw them in the case for 15-20 minutes and they come out feeling like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that they&#x27;re discontinuing this is going to make me seriously consider LASIK as there is no other product on the market that I know of that can clean lenses as well as Aquify in such a short amount of time.</li>
    <li> None of the other solutions worked for me - after a couple of days, I would feel contacts get cloudy and would irritate my eyes.  Not this one - every day I put on the lenses - it is better than straight out of the box.  I was surprised that Walgreens no longer carry them, nor CVS.  Please do not discontinue this product!  There are many like me who are willing to pay extra.</li>
    <li> I live in Australia and was horrified to receive a communication from my optometrist to advise that this product is being withdrawn from the market in 2014.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it overseas in Europe and here for many years.&lt;br /&gt;I am aware that Ciba Vision have merged or been bought over by Alcon but that should not prevent them from continuing to sell this product. I cannot use Optifree it makes my eyes red and I cannot use peroxide products either.&lt;br /&gt;I have thrown away a lot of money trying other solutions and this is the only one that I can use.&lt;br /&gt;Please all loyal Aquify MPS users spread the word on this so that this brilliant product continues to be available to all of us!!&lt;br /&gt;I have already  contacted Alcon USA in this regard and I will be posting to every website I can find regarding this issue.</li>
    <li> for the price I paid I at least expect to get something that expires within a year, I may want to store it for at least a month or two before i use it...  So i wasnt to happy with that aspect. Otherwise this is a great product</li>
    <li> I purchased Aquify Contact Lens Multi-purpose Solution from Amazon because I couldn&#x27;t find it at my local stores. It is a great four purpose solution for all.</li>
    <li> I have tried every saline out there for my soft contacts and I love this.  I will spend the extra money all the time for this solution.  It keeps my contacts very soft and lubricated, not sure how else to explain it, while cleaning them impecably.  I will definitely keep ordering this, because you cannot get this at the store.</li>
    <li> Hard to find in stores now but this is my favorite solution. Always works best for me and keeps my eyes wet</li>
    <li> Great solution which I have been using for years.  Sad to see that it is being discontinued, but glad to find a source for a while.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive eyes and this is the only contact solution that works for me.  It&#x27;s hard to find in stores now so I order online.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Why is Ciba Vision stopped making this product ? This is the best solution i have ever used, i used Air Optix O2 contact lenses and i take them out every night and soak them in this solution. it works great. over the period time though this solution have got expensive, is it because of the high demand ? why is this not available anywhere else ?</li>
    <li> Aquify is a wonderful lens cleaner. It is impossible to buy locally now, so I order it. I have not found another brand that tops this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a recent contact wearer and I have been going through the process of trying to determine which contact solution works best for me. I have narrowed it down to this due to the 5 minute minimum cleaning time, how well it cleans and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. It moisturizes really well allowing me to wear my contacts all day. I do clean my lens over night but also wanted the convenience of a quick clean if needed. It was between this and BioTrue which I still like but it was beat by the minimum cleaning time and price per oz. I found this on the the Military base for $8 and this is the only size that they carry, which makes it an excellent value even here on Amazon compared to the single bottle. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years and it has been discontinued. I was happy to find it on Amazon and it is the same good contact lense solution I have enjoyed using in the past.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this contact solution! I am very disappointed that  Alcon is discontinuing it. I hope to be able to find in stores again.</li>
    <li> I absoluetly hate giving one stars but honesty is where its at. I bought new contact lenses and i followed all the instructions, but now my contacts are ruined and this product burns like tapatio to the eyes. Absoluetly do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this item! Its the only one in the market I&#x27;ve found that really suits my eyes. I really wish they weren&#x27;t discontinuing it. Bummer! Ive used it for years now.. Maybe more than 10.</li>
    <li> This is great contact solution.  My eyes feel so much better when I use this solution, and my disposable contacts last longer when I use this.  How come the good stuff gets discontinued?</li>
    <li> Gave this is as a gift to my friend and he absolutely loves it!  This is now the only contact solution he purchases!</li>
    <li> As others have said, this is the best solution out there. I am sad to see that it is being discontinued, because other solutions have irritated my eyes, given me headaches, and/or not cleaned my contacts sufficiently. If others who like Aquify have found a suitable alternative, I would appreciate hearing about it.</li>
    <li> Nice to have both sizes for both home and travel size. Fits in my 3 oz bag size and sails through security at the airport.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different lens cleaning products, but none work as well as Aquify. It cleans my lenses better, and keeps them moist longer. I have an astigmatism in one eye, and so wear special contacts. The other cleaners seem to work OK for the standard lens, but Aquify is the only product that keeps my astigmatism lens clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> i am always scared to order of the internet, but this time I was very happy with what I got.</li>
    <li> This is the product my eye doctor recommended. I have nothing bad to say. It does just what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> too bad they quit making it</li>
    <li> This is the best solution ever made for people with sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> I am beyond sad that Ciba decided to pull this product from the market. I have tried almost all the other brands, and they are not the same. I will continue to purchase the Aquify solution via Amazon for as long as I can, and not think about the replacement solution until I absolutely need to.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Just love it! Tried many solutions &amp; found this one to be the best for me! Thank you!</li>
    <li> The only solution I have found over the last several years that allows me to comfortably wear my contacts all day long.</li>
    <li> Love the product!  Too bad it is now discontinued.</li>
    <li> The product i love.  I have allergies and this is the best solution for me.  What i dont like is people taking advantage of the fact it cant be found so they over charg for a health care product.  The one i purchased from was not the greatest price but i do have to say atleast they were not asking $50.00 per bottle as some are.  So sad greed can afect others health care.</li>
