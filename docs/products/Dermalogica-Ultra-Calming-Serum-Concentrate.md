      <li>I simply love this product.</li>
      <li>I love this product and when Dermalogica changed the packaging from 1.7 to 1.3 fl.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s part of what I love about it.</li>
      <li>love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for almost 2 years now with the Ultracalming Cleanser and could not be more pleased.  </li>
      <li>pleased.</li>
      <li>I love this serum.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, and this is great for calming it.</li>
      <li>and I need some antiaging along with more significant hydration that this can offer.</li>
      <li>I also have rosacea and flush easily.  </li>
      <li>I received my package very quickly.</li>
      <li>Also a huge fan of the rice exfoliator.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Is fantastic.</li>
      <li>Light and soothing feel.  </li>
      <li>Was tempted by the cheap price</li>
      <li>This ones is light and can be used under makeup.</li>
      <li>This cream did not seem as rich as the cream bought at Sephora.</li>
      <li>Great for my skin which is dry on the outer layer, but oil producing under that.</li>
      <li>It is a nice serum, no allergic problems, a nice texture, but it is not what I expected since I had been told that it is a miracle.</li>
      <li>I am so happy I found an authentic product for considerably less!</li>
      <li>It is OK, but not so much...</li>
      <li>Many face is very sensitve and acne prone.  </li>
      <li>I am over 8 months pregnant</li>
      <li>Why am I running out of the serum so quickly?</li>
      <li>I like these products better and the lotion is thick, which is nice on when the face is damp after cleansing because it lets the lotion sink it better.  </li>
      <li>It is worth every penny to me.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pricey but worth it.</li>
      <li>Already use this product and know it is worth the money.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels hydrated and fresh.</li>
      <li>AND my skin easily clogs on top of being dry and this will not clog.</li>
      <li>My product has a very strong smell similar to rosemary.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind the smell, though it isn&#x27;t flowery or necessarily pleasant (maybe a little astringent).  </li>
      <li>amazon is the bomb, you all always come through for me on the products i like and with awesome pricing as usual...!!!</li>
      <li>When I first used it, I got a rash on part of my face.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for about a year and was really glad to see I could buy it online for a much better price than usual.</li>
      <li>I had a facial using these products and have been in love ever since.</li>
      <li>I bought the sampler pack first to try it out and was immediately hooked.</li>
      <li>Or, if you&#x27;re close to a Dermalogica salon or retailer, they&#x27;re usually very generous with samples!</li>
      <li>I have super sensitive skin that&#x27;s affected by most skin care products resulting in worsening my red appearance.</li>
      <li>This might be ok for others, but I am scent sensitive (migraine sensitive) and lavender is one of those scents that doesn&#x27;t do well with me.      </li>
      <li>Before I started using it, I had red irritated skin and now my skin is clear, soft and gorgeous.  </li>
      <li>I honestly believe it will work for most people, especially as I&#x27;ve tried nearly every \\&quot;adult acne\\&quot; product at Sephora not to mention the regular brands like Aveeno, Clearasil, and Clean &amp; Clear.  </li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin that dries out quickly (and starts to peel/flake), but is also oily in the t-zone.  </li>
      <li>This product was one of the better ones in the line and it did help to calm my skin down.</li>
      <li>I had acne and now (at age 28) I still battle pimples, large pores, and oily skin.  </li>
      <li>Especially good for using after a long day in the sun or after a serious facial that includes a light peal.  </li>
      <li>This serum is absolutely fabulous for my red skin.</li>
      <li>I feel like if it did this much this fast</li>
      <li>The serum has left my skin balanced and breakout free.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>when I can afford it haha.</li>
      <li>I use this alone in the summer and under the barrier repair in the winter (my skin doesn&#x27;t like too much on it).</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and tend to get red blotches easily.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely cheaper on amazon than the salon, too, and worth every penny!</li>
      <li>I use &#x27;no fragrance&#x27; products and none of the other of the many products I have of Dermalogica</li>
      <li>other than that i love this product..</li>
      <li>I switched to another famous brand just to try them - sent them back because they seemed such much thicker and heavier on my face.  </li>
      <li>This works better although much more expensive.</li>
      <li>I particularly like the way that it smells.  </li>
      <li>this product leaves your skin silky smooth and keeps sensitive skin from being affected from the daily pollutants in the air.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product soothes red skin and helps my breakouts heal faster. Highly recommended from my Esthetician.</li>
    <li> terrible product,i had some left from one time i got it in a hair saloon, and i just opened the one i got in amazon and its so watery and the smell is not even close to what i had.  i wont even buy here again!</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a sample in an Ultracalming product sample pack with the cleanser, masque, etc.  It was a great deal to try it at $40 or so.  I bought this product because I am on a number of medications that make my skin red and blotchy in the cheeks. I was referred to this product by a saleswoman in an Ulta store.    In the Dermalogica sample pack I like the other products ok (the barrier is the best, it is so silky smooth), but this product I can&#x27;t stand.  For one thing, it is very runny and since it comes in a tube (at least the trial size does), it makes it hard to deal with. Also, there is the problem, for me at least, that it smells strongly like lavender.  This might be ok for others, but I am scent sensitive (migraine sensitive) and lavender is one of those scents that doesn&#x27;t do well with me.      I also bought the much less expensive Aveeno ultra calming foaming face cleanser ($10)and lotion ($15).  I like these products better and the lotion is thick, which is nice on when the face is damp after cleansing because it lets the lotion sink it better.  Aveeno also has a masque, which I have not tried yet.    In the future I might buy the Dermalogica ultra serum again because I like the texture under makeup, but I don&#x27;t think I would spend the money for the other products when I can get the Aveeno version at a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> other reviews claimed this to be runny and not smell very good or like lavender or being fake prduct. Not true, my product came sealed and it is legit. It smells exactly like lavender which is good, since Lavender is great for your skin. The consistency is like a light lotion, which is fine for being a \\&quot;serum\\&quot;, serums are supposed to be thin, if not liquidy. Serums, like this one are to be used UNDER a moisturizer or Dermalogica Barrier Repair.It is totally working Ive used it for 5 days and my redness is down and its hydrating too. My skin isnt peely. AND my skin easily clogs on top of being dry and this will not clog. Ive used Dermalogica for years and have even sold it in Spas. I always recommend them, and I def recommend this.</li>
    <li> I had been having severe problems with my face for a few years - cracking, bleeding, peeling and pain. Nothing I tried worked. I tried all kinds of natural products. Some would work for awhile and then I would start reacting to whatever I was using that was new - until this. Immediately I felt some relief and definite improvement in a couple of days. It has taken about 9 months of using this for my skin to get close to normal. It&#x27;s not yet 100% but at least it&#x27;s close and no more pain. I thought I would never have normal skin on my face again, but this brought it back. I highly recommend it to anyone with similar problems.</li>
    <li> I used as moisturizer but did not work for me so one day after I had put my makeup my skin was very dry so I put this serum on top of my makup and it worked wonders!! my skin glowed so highly recommend serum.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this line two months ago while having a facial, and purchased the starter kit.  I can&#x27;t get over the results!  No more redness!</li>
    <li> It works for my rosacea.  This and other Ultra Calming products were recommended to me by a skin specialist.  I&#x27;ve been happy ever since I began using them (2 years).</li>
    <li> I used to apply this product only at night. Now I started to use it in the morning and night and have noticed a bigger difference. The redness has almost disappeared. I also highly recommend this seller (Elements Beauty). The shipment arrived way earlier than the estimated arrival time given by amazon. Elements Beauty also included a sample with my purchase. The sample works well for my skin and it was obvious that someone picked out the sample based on my purchase (b/c it&#x27;s also from the ultracalming dermalogica line). Would purchase this product again from this seller.</li>
    <li> I have used for years and it always works.  Keeps my skin from getting red and angry looking. Love it.</li>
    <li> Light and soothing feel.  I particularly like the way that it smells.  I wear it under my make up. thumbs up</li>
    <li> I am suffering with roseca.  I have been for 20 years.  During the last year it has progressed from the regular redness and dryness to itchy red bumps that look like small pimples.  They cover my face near the hairline and behind my ears.  This product has all but taken them away!! It was a fantastic find!  I was using cortisone cream daily which is not great for the skin.  This works better although much more expensive. It is worth every penny to me.  I am writing this for people who may be suffering with the same thing I am.  This could be your fix.  I wish I would have found it years ago..</li>
    <li> The Ultracalming line of Dermalogica skin care products is amazing! I bought the sampler pack first to try it out and was immediately hooked. After using the product for maybe a week I had two different people (one was my husband) ask me if I was wearing make-up when I had actually just washed my face or didn&#x27;t have anything on my face. I had to invest in the whole line of the larger sizes and it&#x27;s money well spent!&lt;br /&gt;I read a few people didn&#x27;t like the \\&quot;runniness\\&quot; of this moisturizer but that&#x27;s part of what I love about it. It glides over my face and I don&#x27;t pull on my skin at all in any direction in attempts to spread/smear the moisturizer on my face which I&#x27;ve had to do with thicker lotions. I have to also admit that I think the product has made me look younger and my skin has been clearer and less blotchy than it&#x27;s ever been in my life and I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s. I love this product!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It moisturizes without causing redness and is great for twice a day or even once a day.&lt;br /&gt;My biggest gripe with this line of products is the sizing. I started out with the starter kit. The barrier repair and ultra calming cleanser last FOREVER!  Why am I running out of the serum so quickly? I wish they would make sizes that match their usage. It&#x27;s frustrating to buy too much of one product and not enough of another product.</li>
    <li> This is great for your skin.I like all dermalogica products.I also  use the total eyecare and Ultra calming face wash</li>
    <li> Excellent product and fantastic price!</li>
    <li> Instead of sending 1 tube that was 1.7 oz received 6 sample size tubes that were 0.3 oz each.  This wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting for what I paid, but at least received a little extra due to the size of the product sent.  Not sure if I would buy from here again as the advertising is deceptive.</li>
    <li> ok, loved the ads!  fell hook line and sinker.  stuff does not work.&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I burned my eyelids using this.</li>
    <li> Wonderful moisturizer for sensitive skin. I have eczema and it has improved since using the product and there is no sting with applying. I also haven&#x27;t had a break out since switching to Dermalogica. My skin has a healthy glow.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost 2 years now with the Ultracalming Cleanser and could not be more pleased.  I use this product twice a day with the cleanser.  I have sensitive skin and this product works great on it!  I am over 8 months pregnant and I swear that this product has helped my skin stay clear of blemishes and imperfections during my pregnancy.  It is a little pricey, but worth every penny.  If you are going to splurge on something, this product is the way to go.</li>
    <li> This soothing and callming serum is wonderful to reduce redness and irritation and help skin feel cool and fresh!  Terrific!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a year and was really glad to see I could buy it online for a much better price than usual. It&#x27;s a staple in my skincare since I have sun sensitivity</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I have pale, highly sensitive skin that reacts negatively to almost anything.  I&#x27;ve been using this serum for over a year now and it calms my skin beautifully!  Whenever I don&#x27;t use it for a few days my face begins to break out and the redness creeps in.  This is a must have for people with sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for working on those fine lines.  Have only been using it 2 weeks but think I notice a difference.  Just another one of those Dermalogica products that is great</li>
    <li> Already use this product and know it is worth the money.  It cleared up my rosacea nicely.</li>
    <li> It works. I always try out dermalogica items but this is one of my favorites. It adds moisture to my face without breaking me out. And of course, I have sensistive skin so this does all the above for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I have bad skin.  I know, everyone says that... but I mean it.  From age 14 to 22 I had acne and now (at age 28) I still battle pimples, large pores, and oily skin.  Plus, I&#x27;m allergic to some random synthetic stuff (mostly in shampoos and conditioners) and allergic reactions have made my skin super sensitized.  I&#x27;d nearly given up on anything that promised to reduce redness AND keep my skin clear.  That was until I stumbled upon the UltraCalming line.  I honestly believe it will work for most people, especially as I&#x27;ve tried nearly every \\&quot;adult acne\\&quot; product at Sephora not to mention the regular brands like Aveeno, Clearasil, and Clean &amp; Clear.  If this sounds like you, but you still were having issues (either your skin was breaking out or really irritated), then I&#x27;d definitely recommend Dermalogica&#x27;s UltraCalming line.    This Serum Concentrate works great, but is runny and a little heavy.  To account for the heaviness, I use it at night without the [[ASIN:B003SGE9E6 Dermalogica UltraCalming Barrier Repair, 1-oz]] (which I use in the mornings), but after using the [[ASIN:B000CR1UUU Dermalogica Cleanser -16 oz Ultracalming Cleanser]] and [[ASIN:B003QD1T9Y Dermalogica UltraCalming Mist 6 fl oz.]].  I don&#x27;t mind the smell, though it isn&#x27;t flowery or necessarily pleasant (maybe a little astringent).  I do believe that this serum concentrate is the \\&quot;backbone\\&quot; of the treatment and should be used daily.  I get away with not using the Barrier Repair every day (especially if my skin still feels hydrated in the morning), but definitely always cleanse, mist and use the serum concentrate.  This regimen has cleared up my skin (actually better than I expected considering how gentle the cleanser is) and almost totally evened out my skin tone (nearly ZERO rosacea!).  I understand everyone is different and so would recommend purchasing the [[ASIN:B003QD5TOK Dermalogica The Ultra Calming Treatment Kit 5 piece]] before investing in the full-size products.  Or, if you&#x27;re close to a Dermalogica salon or retailer, they&#x27;re usually very generous with samples!</li>
    <li> My face doesn&#x27;t react and I feel moisturized without the added greasy feeling.  I use this in combination with the Barrier Repair and highly recommend to anyone with reactive skin.</li>
    <li> Many face is very sensitve and acne prone.  I always have to be careful of my eating habits but this product definitely helps calm my skin.  I use it at night after cleansing and add ultracalming moisturizing tint to lock it in and my skin has never been better.</li>
    <li> Love the Dermalogica calming products! This ones is light and can be used under makeup.</li>
    <li> I have really bad rosacea all over my face and behind my ears. My skin is red and blotchy and really flaky around the eyebrows. After using this product TWICE I saw a difference. The bumps that had just recently shown up and the redness though still present, improved right away. I feel like if it did this much this fast I am going to be one happy camper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased. I have super sensitive skin that&#x27;s affected by most skin care products resulting in worsening my red appearance. This product does actually \\&quot;calm\\&quot; the redness. Better than the prescriptions I&#x27;ve been given over the years by doctors.</li>
    <li> It is a nice serum, no allergic problems, a nice texture, but it is not what I expected since I had been told that it is a miracle. It is OK, but not so much...</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and this is great for calming it.</li>
    <li> This must be an old (outdated?) version of this product because it seems to be in an entirely different container as now listed on Amazon. My product has a very strong smell similar to rosemary. This is an irritating fragrance for my skin.  I use &#x27;no fragrance&#x27; products and none of the other of the many products I have of Dermalogica have an aroma. When I first used it, I got a rash on part of my face. I have rosecea and I buy the ultra calming line.  I must have been sent an expired or discontinued product just before the new bottle came out (or afterwards) to get rid of expired product. Watch out! Do not buy the product in this tube container!</li>
    <li> It calms my skin a little but leaves a film on my skin that causes me to break out.</li>
    <li> Amazing product and great for sensitive skin. I use a few of their other masks as well. The only masks I uses, actually.</li>
    <li> I tried this line when my skin suddenly became ultra sensitive to the Clarins products I was using. I began to break out and develop blotchy red itchy patches that were drivingme crazy. I saw several reviews on the Dermalogica products and how they were for sensitive skin so I tried them. This product was one of the better ones in the line and it did help to calm my skin down. However, it really wasn&#x27;t hydrating enough and didnlt have any antiaging benefits at all that I could see. I have since switched to Perricone MD&#x27;s Hypoallergenic line and it suits me much better. I think that if your skin is sensitive but not all that dry and you are on the younger side (not really concerned with fine lines yet) this line would be good. In my case I am 37 and I need some antiaging along with more significant hydration that this can offer.</li>
    <li> Product meets expectations.</li>
    <li> amazon is the bomb, you all always come through for me on the products i like and with awesome pricing as usual...!!!</li>
    <li> I started using these products after I had a facial at a spa.  Unbelievable.  I switched to another famous brand just to try them - sent them back because they seemed such much thicker and heavier on my face.  Such a fresh feel from these products</li>
    <li> I was a little shocked at how runny this product was. Like water. It smells good and was sealed but unexpected and skeptical. Using this under barrier repair and also had to use another moisturizer because my face was very dry flakey at first use. A week or two later and I don&#x27;t seem to need one at night just in am after I shower. My face is always very red. After reading these reviews I had to give it a try. I don&#x27;t see a noticeable difference but it is helping with my little bumpy so called breakouts on my forehead. It&#x27;s like my skin is congested so I think I will try their face wash as well..when I can afford it haha.</li>
    <li> this product leaves your skin silky smooth and keeps sensitive skin from being affected from the daily pollutants in the air. i use it with my foundation in the morning by putting a small dab on the applicator and mixing it with my foundation. helps your foundation go on easier also. use sparingly too much left me feeling greasy and shiny. other than that i love this product..</li>
    <li> I have always had problematic skin.  Very oily, porous, but extremely sensitive. The Ultra calming line of skin care from dermalogicaI&lt;br /&gt;Is fantastic. I purchased the Ultra calming serum concentrate and the ultra calming barrier repair. both products have been wonderful for my aging problematic skin.&lt;br /&gt; The serum has left my skin balanced and breakout free. I use it in the morning and evening after cleansing.  The result after just two weeks is clear, softened skin that does not look like it belongs on a 62 year old face. the barrier repair moisturizer is just that--a barrier against environmental pollutants while still moisturizing.  Amazon offers the best prices on this skin care line so I intend to purchase all of the ultra calming regime products by DermalogicaI.  This is one skin care product that produced great results and is worth the purchase price.</li>
    <li> This serum is absolutely fabulous for my red skin. My skin is super sensitive and I have had issues with moisturizing products in the past. I had a facial using these products and have been in love ever since. Yes, this item is runny, but it is a serum. I use this alone in the summer and under the barrier repair in the winter (my skin doesn&#x27;t like too much on it). I have found that the redness in my nose/cheeks/above my eyebrows has decreased significantly since I&#x27;ve started using these products. Also a huge fan of the rice exfoliator.</li>
    <li> moisturizes without the oil.  Great for my skin which is dry on the outer layer, but oil producing under that.</li>
    <li> I simply love this product. Before I started using it, I had red irritated skin and now my skin is clear, soft and gorgeous.  Best of all it doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out which I am prone to do. I wouldn&#x27;t be without this product.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin, and this just works.  Within the first few days, it eliminated my redness and itchiness.  My skin would react with redness and irritation to stressful situations and weather changes, and this somehow stops that process.  Feels a bit watery and slick going on, but absorbs fast and I would recommend it wholeheartedly.  I use it once a day under dermalogica sunscreen (dynamic recovery).</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I always a Dermalogica user and this product my skin looks great. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Leaves my face oily and irritated.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin that dries out quickly (and starts to peel/flake), but is also oily in the t-zone.  I also have rosacea and flush easily.  I&#x27;ve been using this product in combination with the hydrating booster, ultracalming wash, eye cream, and daily microfoliant for a few years and it literally changed my life.  I also use Eucerin calming night cream during dry months. I used to be self-conscious because, especially in winter, my face was usually peeling or ashy with dry, rough spots.  I haven&#x27;t had a problem with that since starting with Dermalogica - and I tried everything. Recently, I lost the ultracalming serum while traveling and went a couple weeks without - I noticed the difference immediately - not as evenly moisturized, tight skin - even with using the other products. It&#x27;s light, not greasy or irritating, and I love it.  Highly recommend for sensitive skin, rosacea, and those that need a moderate moisturizer that isn&#x27;t too heavy/greasy.  A bottle this size, although expensive, lasts me 9 months.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. A little pricey but it feels great on my skin. I would definitely buy again. I received my package very quickly.</li>
    <li> I love this product and when Dermalogica changed the packaging from 1.7 to 1.3 fl. oz., but for the same price, I decided to look on Amazon. I am so happy I found an authentic product for considerably less!</li>
    <li> I have severe rosacea (I even suffer from ocular rosacea) and this product instantly cools and soothes my skin. I follow it up with barrier repair and my skin feels wonderful and can pass for healthy! I would totally recommend this product to anyone who suffers from rosacea or environmental sensitivity. A little tip....put it in the fridge for about 20 minutes before applying it. It doubles the calming feeling!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and tend to get red blotches easily.  This miracle serum keeps the redness at bay.</li>
    <li> Quality didn&#x27;t seem the same as the bottles I usually buy at my facial shop. There was no silver seal on the bottle (usually is so you know it hasn&#x27;t been tampered with) so I have no idea what was in there. It seemed watered down with a different lotion. Was tempted by the cheap price but you get what you pay for I guess...</li>
    <li> Especially good for using after a long day in the sun or after a serious facial that includes a light peal.  I always follow the application with another moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have had rosacea on my cheeks for years and nothing helped until my massage therapist recommended Dermalogica. I&#x27;ll never go without this again. My skin feels hydrated and fresh. I use it after every shower. It&#x27;s definitely cheaper on amazon than the salon, too, and worth every penny!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and light, but didn&#x27;t work the way i thought it would.  I have very sensitive skin and, while it was calming, it didn&#x27;t work markedly better -- so not worth the price.</li>
    <li> This product calms my super sensitive and red skin...like a sigh a relief. it&#x27;s pricey but worth it. love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This cream did not seem as rich as the cream bought at Sephora. Cannot put my finger on this except it does not seem like the same product.</li>
