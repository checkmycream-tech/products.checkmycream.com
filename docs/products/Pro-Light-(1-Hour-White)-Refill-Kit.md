      <li>Make sure you make the time to use this product...</li>
      <li>Wish i could find more</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still pretty bright.  </li>
      <li>Why is the refil more than the original product????????</li>
      <li>I only did about seven rinses and got good results!</li>
      <li>liquid does not burn the mouth and easy to apply</li>
      <li>so I really expected for them to be brilliant after an hour,</li>
      <li>but I think its just from the way you have to position the light in your mouth.  </li>

      <li>I originally read about it in a bridal magazine about inexpensive ways to freshen yourself up for cheap.  </li>

      <li>The first time I used this product I was truly amazed at how it whiten my teeth!</li>
      <li>Used it for first time using full cycle</li>
      <li>Be sure to change the batteries in the \\&quot;blue light\\&quot; as the light consumes them after about 20 applications.</li>
      <li>Overall great results, at home, with no messy trays, or strips to leave in your mouth for longer periods of time.</li>
      <li>If you want to reorder the refill kit you&#x27;re better off going directly to the luster website.</li>
      <li>I have used this product twice through the full recommended cycle of coating and rinsing and have noticed a positive difference in the color of my teeth.</li>
      <li>I was really glad to be able to re-purchase this refill kit instead of having to pay for the little machine again.</li>
      <li>I did start with a preventive teeth cleaning from the dentist first.</li>
      <li>This product was listed as the best way to have a long lasting white smile without having to go for that whitening treatment at the dentist.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I first bought this as a kit in the store and used it up.</li>
      <li>This whole system is too expensive but it&#x27;s the best out there.  </li>
      <li>gave me such a healthy white smile, I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  </li>
      <li>(beware when you take it out of your mouth) is very high.  </li>
      <li>but after 2 uses, I really couldn&#x27;t tell a difference.  </li>
      <li>The batteries run out really fast - and the drool-factor</li>
      <li>Work very well.</li>
      <li>It was for my daughter, I had bought her the whole pkg for her Christmas stocking one year, that&#x27;s what she wanted.</li>
      <li>Your batteries will last for 20 uses so make sure you have extra batteries on hand.</li>
      <li>I did the treatment about a year ago and the whiteness might have faded some [mainly because I can&#x27;t stay away from the coffee and the soda]</li>
      <li>Sorry, but I&#x27;ll take a little bit of drooling for a cheap but beautiful white smile any day.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m trying a new brand and see how if it will give the result I need or want.</li>
      <li>Oh and if you have sensitive teeth and gums as I do, when you do your regular brushing with any of their toothpastes, I advice you add a little bit of sensodyne toothpaste for your own gums safety.</li>
      <li>The first time I used Luster White I applied and rinsed 10x instead of the suggested 20x.  </li>
      <li>So I ordered it for her stocking this past year, believe it or not she was so excited!</li>
      <li>Was I at fault for not coating my whole entire mouth in petroleum jelly?</li>
      <li>Think a dentist is the only real way to get whiter teeth.</li>
      <li>Read some reviews that Luster didn&#x27;t whiten teeth enough, but if your teeth are already pretty white, why would you see a noticable difference?  </li>
      <li>I started with 6 back to back applications on the first day and followed it with an additional 6 on the second day.  </li>
      <li>Especially when this product didn&#x27;t hurt my already extremely sensitive teeth.</li>

    <li> A great product, works very well.  Will definitely use again.</li>
    <li> Even though the first purchase of it is expensive ($40), this product is worth every penny that you put down.  I originally read about it in a bridal magazine about inexpensive ways to freshen yourself up for cheap.  This product was listed as the best way to have a long lasting white smile without having to go for that whitening treatment at the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gave me such a healthy white smile, I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  I did the treatment about a year ago and the whiteness might have faded some [mainly because I can&#x27;t stay away from the coffee and the soda] but it&#x27;s still pretty bright.  I simply cannot get over how well this product works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that there is a little bit of drooling but I think its just from the way you have to position the light in your mouth.  Sorry, but I&#x27;ll take a little bit of drooling for a cheap but beautiful white smile any day.</li>
    <li> I liked this product because it is an alternative to those annoying whitening strips and it only takes an hour.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tryed directlly when arrived&lt;br /&gt;It needs actually more that an hour and need a bit of relaxed nerves!!&lt;br /&gt;The liquid does not burn the mouth and easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;I would(and I have allready) recomeded to anyone I know as a great product for people the like this kind of stuff to do by themselves instead of spending more than 10 times more money on a dentist.</li>
    <li> It works great as long as you read and follow the directions, just like everything. If you want to reorder the refill kit you&#x27;re better off going directly to the luster website.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had white teeth so I really expected for them to be brilliant after an hour, but after 2 uses, I really couldn&#x27;t tell a difference.  I won&#x27;t re-order.</li>
    <li> Great stuf! I took vacation pictures and noticed how white my teeth looked! I only did about seven rinses and got good results! I did start with a preventive teeth cleaning from the dentist first. I noticed the difference!</li>
    <li> The first time I used this product I was truly amazed at how it whiten my teeth! I still am. Especially when this product didn&#x27;t hurt my already extremely sensitive teeth. The second time I decided to whiten my teeth you can imagine my disappointment when after I whitened my very sensitive teeth and gums became extremely inflamed and irritated. I couldn&#x27;t solid foods because of the pain for about a week and a half. It did whiten my teeth but at what cost? Was I at fault for not coating my whole entire mouth in petroleum jelly? I will try whitening my mouth again but this time I will do just that, cover my gums in Vaseline! Oh and if you have sensitive teeth and gums as I do, when you do your regular brushing with any of their toothpastes, I advice you add a little bit of sensodyne toothpaste for your own gums safety.</li>
    <li> This whole system is too expensive but it&#x27;s the best out there.  The batteries run out really fast - and the drool-factor (beware when you take it out of your mouth) is very high.  However it does whiten teeth like nobody&#x27;s business.</li>
    <li> I first bought this as a kit in the store and used it up. I needed just to refill the kit. I use it every couple of months to keep my smile bright.</li>
    <li> Why is the refil more than the original product????????</li>
    <li> This is a great whitening product. I am a heavy green tea drinker and after using multiple brands of toothpaste decided to try this product. The directions call for initial multiple applications of about 2-3 minutes each to begin the whitening effect. I started with 6 back to back applications on the first day and followed it with an additional 6 on the second day.  A total of 60 minutes and I could notice several shades of lightening on the teeth treated.  I continued to use for 2 weeks with excellent results. I purchased the \\&quot;refill\\&quot; kit of pre-rinse and whitening gel after using it for about 1 month 2-3 applications twice a week. Be sure to change the batteries in the \\&quot;blue light\\&quot; as the light consumes them after about 20 applications. The light will be dimmer and the whitening effect will be diminished unless you replace the batteries. Overall great results, at home, with no messy trays, or strips to leave in your mouth for longer periods of time.</li>
    <li> Read some reviews that Luster didn&#x27;t whiten teeth enough, but if your teeth are already pretty white, why would you see a noticable difference?  As a tea, coffee, and red wine drinker, my teeth need to be whitened.  I have used this product twice through the full recommended cycle of coating and rinsing and have noticed a positive difference in the color of my teeth.</li>
    <li> The Luster system is the one whitening system that works really well for me without irritating my teeth and gums.  I was really glad to be able to re-purchase this refill kit instead of having to pay for the little machine again. Two thumbs up from me!</li>
    <li> It works as well as it was described. Only 3-4 applications whiten your teeth and it lasts for a long time. I strongly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It was for my daughter, I had bought her the whole pkg for her Christmas stocking one year, that&#x27;s what she wanted. She loves it! But needed the refill and we couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. So she went on line and found it and told me about it. So I ordered it for her stocking this past year, believe it or not she was so excited!</li>
    <li> When I used this product the result were awesome but the next two application of 20 had no affect on my teeth.  So I&#x27;m trying a new brand and see how if it will give the result I need or want.</li>
    <li> Wish i could find more</li>
    <li> This is a refill for the Luster kit I originally bought. Great at home whitening. Came quickly too.&lt;br /&gt;it works</li>
    <li> Work very well. Used it for first time using full cycle and I could see makeable difference. Definitely would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Seemed to work at first but not so sure now. Think a dentist is the only real way to get whiter teeth.</li>
    <li> works, but not enough lightening gel.</li>
    <li> I have to say...IMPRESSIVE!  My teeth look sooooo white.  Make sure you make the time to use this product...you will want to turn your cell OFF in order to not be disturbed.  The first time I used Luster White I applied and rinsed 10x instead of the suggested 20x.  Your batteries will last for 20 uses so make sure you have extra batteries on hand. I have already ordered another 2 kits and plan Luster White to be another part of my \\&quot;up keep\\&quot;...trust me.</li>
