      <li>In a trip to Seattle, Washington, I bought the Fa Farm&#x27;s Organic Healing Hemp Salve hoping top help him with the itch ir causes.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve shared it with tons of friends who have either eczema or psoriasis and they LOVE the stuff.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product!</li>
      <li>My kids call it the magic salve.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this many times.  </li>
      <li>pretty good to my skin,it help .</li>
      <li>I love the scent, and it goes on easily.</li>
      <li>Has a very natural smell that I kind of liked.</li>
      <li>Awesome on face for acne and other scars and blemishes.</li>
      <li>strongly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is very strong and the first word that comes to my mind when trying to describe it, is &amp;#34;industrial&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>We are huge fans and will continue to use the healing hemp salve.</li>
      <li>It has made a great difference in the outbreaks with regular use!</li>
      <li>and it will stain light clothes or bedding, which is the reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
      <li>each ingredient is beneficial so you&#x27;re not paying for any cheap fillers.</li>
      <li>, it does have a distinct smell, but it&#x27;s not horrific or by any means a deal breaker.</li>
      <li>Also helped some eczema on my hands though for that I prefer the lotion version of this that is available.</li>
      <li>An excellent herbal product, with no side effects, very soothing, I have been using it for several years,</li>
      <li>So far so good</li>
      <li>The salve melts quickly and spreads easily when applying it to the skin.  </li>
      <li>It can be a bit &amp;#34;hippy&amp;#34; smelling but since it gives you such amazing results, I promise you will not mind it at all!  </li>
      <li>This product will help you with any dry skin problem and it smells great.</li>
      <li>This product is nice, and I like the smell (some people don&#x27;t care for it, I for one like earthy/natural/non sweet and fruity or vanilla-ey scents) - it was supposed to clear up psoriasis though, and I didn&#x27;t see any change.</li>
      <li>Farm holds true to what mother Nature intended by creating this skin cell nourishing moisturizing cream.</li>
      <li>The hemp salve helps tremendously.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always careful as to what kinds of things I use on my face, but this stuff is amazing!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about this amazing product.</li>
      <li>Well worth the investment.</li>
      <li>When we are really vigilant, we put in on the affected areas 3x a day ( in the morning, after school and before bed) and in 1-2 days we notice a significant improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
      <li>Great product but a little bit pricey!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Thank you very much for creating this blend of oils and herbs.</li>
      <li>It is packaged in a really nice &amp;#34;tin&amp;#34; that you will not want to discard when empty.  </li>
      <li>I actually recognize and can pronounce most of the ingredients.</li>
      <li>On the first day I got this product I burned myself taking a pizza out of the oven.</li>
      <li>worked the first time i used it..</li>
      <li>but after a few days, looks good.</li>
      <li>, it makes new makes go away quickly.</li>
      <li>It works well on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;The 3 star rating is reflective of my positive experience for my hands, but no benefit for my dog.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I use something that works so fast and so well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells very strongly of hemp, lavender and other herbs</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what the dry raised area was...skin CA, eczema or psoriasis?</li>
      <li>Would certainly recommend</li>
      <li>5 stars&lt;br /&gt;I am certainly going to buy it again for myself and family and give as gifts to everyone</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve been really impressed with this salve and have been trying to make the last little bit last for months</li>
      <li>but I felt like people should really know about this product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Helped my wife SO much with rashes from her pregnancy.</li>
      <li>It made my skin softer, but it didn&#x27;t really fix anything.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works.</li>
      <li>I bought this stuff to help with my son&#x27;s eczema - and it works really well.</li>
      <li>I have psoriasis on my face (and body) and found that this stuff really helps relieve the itching and flaking.</li>
      <li>5 stars&lt;br /&gt;Shipped fast.  </li>
      <li>It really hydrates the skin.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works the my eczema on my hand.  </li>
      <li>The rosemary &amp; eucalyptus combo is very penetrating and way &amp;#34;overdone&amp;#34;, in my view.  </li>
      <li>Really helped my knee aches</li>
      <li>It provided instant relief... but it took about 1 week to notice the true positive healing results.</li>
      <li>I was pleased as other products have not worked for me.</li>
      <li>This is the only salve that has worked to significantly reduce my husband&#x27;s eczema, through 20 years of trying both mineral oil based and botanically based products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used this to clear up outbreaks and it is the first thing that has ever worked in the 30+ years I have had psoriasis.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this amazing product. I share it with everyone I meet. Works wonders and smells awesome.</li>
    <li> Works well for cracked heels, but it is greasy. One of the better products I&#x27;ve found to keep my heels in good shape and from splitting. Also helped some eczema on my hands though for that I prefer the lotion version of this that is available.</li>
    <li> This product is nice, and I like the smell (some people don&#x27;t care for it, I for one like earthy/natural/non sweet and fruity or vanilla-ey scents) - it was supposed to clear up psoriasis though, and I didn&#x27;t see any change. It made my skin softer, but it didn&#x27;t really fix anything. I was told about it by someone at a makeup counter locally who raved about it.</li>
    <li> Does it heal cancer? I don&#x27;t know. But it does soothe skin irritations. I bought it to put on my mom&#x27;s pre skin cancer areas on her face. Turns red at first but after a few days, looks good.</li>
    <li> I use Healing Hemp Salve  around my son&#x27;s stomach site,it keeps the acid from eating away his skin. I also use it on my hands where the skin gets dry and peeling. It works on many blemishes.</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff to help with my son&#x27;s eczema - and it works really well. I love the scent, and it goes on easily. So far, it&#x27;s helping his eczema, and I use it on any skin irritation that any of us get. Good product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s greasy so you have to be putting gloves on or going to bed when you use it.</li>
    <li> I love it.  5 stars&lt;br /&gt;Shipped fast.  5 stars&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this product. 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;I am certainly going to buy it again for myself and family and give as gifts to everyone I know.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing ingredients.</li>
    <li> not a good skin ointment.  there are other products out there that relieve the pain.  would not recommend</li>
    <li> An excellent herbal product, with no side effects, very soothing, I have been using it for several years,</li>
    <li> This stuff really works the my eczema on my hand.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has eczema!</li>
    <li> great product! eliminates the little red bumps i get on my upper arms. i was also able to use it on my 3 y.o. niece who is very fair and has really sensitive skin. it cleared up a little rash she had on her legs. my brother has psoriasis on his legs and this helps clear that up when i can get him to use it regularly. i&#x27;ve been really impressed with this salve and have been trying to make the last little bit last for months (i bought this at the fay farm stand at pike&#x27;s place market in seattle when i was there on vacation - happy to see that it&#x27;s sold on amazon!). each ingredient is beneficial so you&#x27;re not paying for any cheap fillers. i don&#x27;t always go for natural products - i buy whatever works the best. i&#x27;ve found this, and other products from Fay Farms, to be very high quality and worth every penny.</li>
    <li> We also ran across this at Pikes Place Market in Seattle. My 8 yr old son suffers from eczema and we&#x27;ve tried all the OTC meds/creams/lotions out there.  We&#x27;ve been in search of an alternative to the steroid prescribed by the doctor since it states that prolonged use can thin the skin. We sampled it there that day at the market and it was the only thing I&#x27;ve ever put on him that didn&#x27;t sting. He sighed &#x27;Ahhhhhh&#x27;, stated he liked it and we were sold after that! This stuff really works. I actually recognize and can pronounce most of the ingredients. I don&#x27;t worry about what it&#x27;s doing to his skin when I slather it on like the steroid. It offers almost immediate relief from itching. When we are really vigilant, we put in on the affected areas 3x a day ( in the morning, after school and before bed) and in 1-2 days we notice a significant improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does have a distinct smell, but it&#x27;s not horrific or by any means a deal breaker. You get used to it. Frankly, it could smell worse and we&#x27;d still use it because it works. A little goes a long way and I&#x27;ve even ordered more from their website since I was so impressed with the product I brought home from Pikes. We are huge fans and will continue to use the healing hemp salve.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this many times.  My daughter told me about this amazing product and I was hooked when she got me some.  Well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Soothes a serious burn and helps to heal it.</li>
    <li> Someone I know that visited Seattle bought me one of these since I have psoriasis. I was skeptical at first. As someone who has had psoriasis for a long time, you get many people always recommending different treatments and they never work. Well, this works! I&#x27;ve shared it with tons of friends who have either eczema or psoriasis and they LOVE the stuff. I have honestly not found someone who doesn&#x27;t.  I have psoriasis on my face (and body) and found that this stuff really helps relieve the itching and flaking. I&#x27;m always careful as to what kinds of things I use on my face, but this stuff is amazing! It really hydrates the skin. It can be a bit &amp;#34;hippy&amp;#34; smelling but since it gives you such amazing results, I promise you will not mind it at all!  I&#x27;ve tried the lotions, the soaps, the serum... and I love it all.  I never post reviews but I felt like people should really know about this product.</li>
    <li> I have had eczema since childhood. In the past few years, the breakouts on my hands have become frequent and painful. Steroid creams helped for a short time, but the itching and irritation never stopped. After just three days of frequent use of this hemp salve, my skin is clearly healing, is no longer red and the itching has stopped almost completely. I&#x27;m amazed. Nothing has ever worked this well. I&#x27;ve already recommended this product to others.</li>
    <li> I had bought a 1.5 oz. can of this salve at Pikes Market to try it out for Psoriasis, Seemed to help so I ordered (2) 3 oz cans to reduce shipping costs. Both cans are semi-liquid not a paste at all like I received at Pikes in Seattle. The shipping box was was soaked in oil as some of the liquid had leaked out of the cans. Will be contacting Amazon and Fay Farms to see how they handle this.Update-I contacted Fay Farms directly with an email to let them know about the problems with the shipment, they responded immediately and within a couple of days I had received a  replacement shipment. Excellent service and response.</li>
    <li> So far so good it&#x27;s only been two days and people are complementing me on how my skin is just glowing I bought the salve for my eczema</li>
    <li> I am a hemp salve addict.  This product will help you with any dry skin problem and it smells great.</li>
    <li> This is the only salve that has worked to significantly reduce my husband&#x27;s eczema, through 20 years of trying both mineral oil based and botanically based products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells very strongly of hemp, lavender and other herbs and it will stain light clothes or bedding, which is the reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This is a great product my sister who lives overseas uses for the eczema on her hands.&lt;br /&gt;I buy it a few times a year and take it with me when I visit.&lt;br /&gt;Last time I ordered, I received the product, put it aside.&lt;br /&gt;In a few days, I received another shipment with an explanation stating the product they shipped the first time was not set properly, therefore they were sending me a replacement. I would have taken it without opening and we would have wondered what went wrong. I appreciate their ownership.</li>
    <li> I found this product at Pike Street Market in Seattle. It was great, no pressure sales.  Then I kicked myself for not buying some there, and waiting til I got home to order some.  It has made a great difference in the outbreaks with regular use!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to work for my wife. She gets occasional bouts of eczema and this did not alleviate the irritation. She did not notice any improvement. Maybe works for other use cases, but didn&#x27;t work for her.</li>
    <li> Noticed our two-year-old daughter had some eczema starting to form. We used this salve and the results were overnight. Love this product and all the products in their line. So glad it&#x27;s now available on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Already see great results using this on plaque scorisis.  Thankful I ordered 2!</li>
    <li> The ONLY product to use on eczema. My kids call it the magic salve. We no longer use prescription creams!</li>
    <li> Helped my wife SO much with rashes from her pregnancy. Before I bought this cream her rashes would literally wake her up in the middle of the night. Once she started using this cream all rashes were gone within 2 days. This also helped me a bunch with my eczema! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Used this on a spot on my arm and it reduced it that it is almost non existant. Would order this product again.</li>
    <li> It is absolutely the best for psoriasis I have ever had.. I have used this to clear up outbreaks and it is the first thing that has ever worked in the 30+ years I have had psoriasis. I got this in Seattle 3 years ago just to try and was amazed how it cleared my sksin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You Fay Farm&#x27;s,</li>
    <li> Works as described.  Does have an odd odor to it, though.</li>
    <li> My 1 year old grandson suffers a somewhat severe ecsema.  In a trip to Seattle, Washington, I bought the Fa Farm&#x27;s Organic Healing Hemp Salve hoping top help him with the itch ir causes.  The signs of the condition have dissapeared, although we know that webp will have to keep using the medication</li>
    <li> Excellent product, and excellent service.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I bought while I was on vacation at Pike Market in Seattle. Within a couple of days of using this product my psoriasis got so much better. No longer itchy, scales are gone, and I can start to see my normal skin. I highly recommend this for anyone suffering from psoriasis. I have tried several products from medications to over the counter stuff and nothing has ever come close to the results that I am having now... with my psoriasis almost gone.</li>
    <li> great stuff here....worked the first time i used it.. if you have dry skin this is a must to have</li>
    <li> Works great! It got rid of a pimple on my face plus healed my husbands sore he had from a form of dermatitis. A definate recommendation.</li>
    <li> Great product but a little bit pricey!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s products are effective in healing skin disorders</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a rash above my eyelids for 10 years, most likely eczema. They were red, painful, itchy, the usual frustrating symptoms I&#x27;ve had temporary relief with Desonide cream, but it progressively got worse, and ultimately caused me harm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fay Farms Hemp Salve actually HEALED my skin cells. The moment I put it on my skin, my body said YES. It provided instant relief... but it took about 1 week to notice the true positive healing results. After nearly 6 weeks of using almost daily, usually twice a day, my eye lids are almost completely clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearly everything we need is provided from mother Nature. We evolved with it, from it, because of it. We are one with it.... It doesn&#x27;t make sense to go with synthetically lab-produced chemical compounds to heal our ailments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fay Farm holds true to what mother Nature intended by creating this skin cell nourishing moisturizing cream. The residue left over around my eyes and finger tips I rub into my hands of my hair. It feels great and smells pure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be patient with it! If your skin is very bad, slowly ween yourself off of your current creams and ointments, after all, our bodies become addicted to the steroid creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much for creating this blend of oils and herbs. You&#x27;ve changed my life and restored my faith in natural cures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~B</li>
    <li> Works well on my dry skin</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this salve. Before I found this, I suffered from red spots on my legs that kept spreading dispite several visits to multiple doctors and an eczema diagnosis and prescriptions none of which worked. After I found this product the marks went away completely with frequent application. I keep some around in case something else pops up, it makes new makes go away quickly.</li>
    <li> My husband suffers from psoriasis and this lotion helps relieve the dryness of his skin. I wish they sold this in a bigger container!</li>
    <li> I found these guys at the Seattle Pike&#x27;s Market. This is the ONLY product that has ever helped relief from my eczema almost immediately. It&#x27;s all organic so unlike most cortisone creams, it won&#x27;t thin your skin or cause discoloration. I swear by this. Do yourself a favor and buy it.</li>
    <li> Have been using this on a few skin irritations and it cleared them up in days.  Great Product!</li>
    <li> This product is the only one that has made my eczema symptoms disappear.  It took several days to a few weeks and perhaps longer for it to clear up completely, but before the tin was empty my eczema was gone.  It works great at relieving the itch, and keeps skin moist as well.  It actually helped to heal the damage that eczema did to my skin.</li>
    <li> This product does seem to promote healing of the skin.  It is packaged in a really nice &amp;#34;tin&amp;#34; that you will not want to discard when empty.  The salve melts quickly and spreads easily when applying it to the skin.  I&#x27;ve given this product four stars because of the way it is scented.  The fragrance is very strong and the first word that comes to my mind when trying to describe it, is &amp;#34;industrial&amp;#34;.  The rosemary &amp; eucalyptus combo is very penetrating and way &amp;#34;overdone&amp;#34;, in my view.  Still, if you can tolerate the odor, it&#x27;s good stuff!</li>
    <li> Bought this to apply on an area of my forearm. Wasn&#x27;t sure what the dry raised area was...skin CA, eczema or psoriasis? Anyway, bought this salve and used it regularly. Have also used on my dry winter hands. The dry raised area is now gone, although there is a small flat oval shaped scar where it was...... Would certainly recommend</li>
    <li> Worked for a while then didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I have suffered for months with burning itching on my face. I have over the years tried everything I could find. Simply put this works and is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> On the first day I got this product I burned myself taking a pizza out of the oven. It hurts bad. I apply the salve to the area. It stopped the burning pain and the skin is recovering. This is the first time I use something that works so fast and so well. The smell is good, fresh like nature.</li>
    <li> pretty good to my skin,it help .</li>
    <li> Great product, worked super well through Amazon</li>
    <li> Long time psoriasis sufferer. I&#x27;ve been using this salve for four weeks now..my psoriasis spots are shrinking. I have seen more healthy tissue again..just incredible</li>
    <li> I beyond LOVE THIS!! I will for sure buy it again. The smell is wonderful also.</li>
    <li> Really helped my knee aches</li>
    <li> Awesome on face for acne and other scars and blemishes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for  my dry hands at night plus it has a great fragrance . The quality of the salve is fresh and great . I will definitely buys this product again.</li>
    <li> I used it on the cracked skin on my feet and it worked for me. I was pleased as other products have not worked for me. Has a very natural smell that I kind of liked.</li>
    <li> It was for my son who has 2 dry patches on his  leg, when contact with maerial he experiences itchinh.  The hemp salve helps tremendously.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! Works wonders! I would recommend it without hesitation!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on past reviews.  This was bought specifically for my 10 year old Boxer.  He has a rash/irritation or something on one of his paws.  We have been working with the vet for over a year now trying oral medicines, medicated wipes, and allergy medicine.  Someone mentioned that this product helped her dog&#x27;s paw issue so I thought I should give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;We have been using it faithfully for 3 weeks and I see no improvement.  The person also mentioned that this salve helps stop licking, but I think my dog kinda likes the flavor.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is pleasant....minty.  I have used it on my hands - dry hands from working in an office with papers.  It works well on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;The 3 star rating is reflective of my positive experience for my hands, but no benefit for my dog.  Afterall, my dog is the reason I purchased this product.</li>
