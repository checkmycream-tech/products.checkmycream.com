<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My nails are strong and long for the first time in the freezing cold Baltimore, MD winters. This dries fast and is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> At least you have something to do while you wait for your nails to improve.&lt;br /&gt;But the rate-limiting-step is the growth speed of your nails-toenails are slow.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, I bot the 3pack so I can stay in the game for 6 months or more, but&lt;br /&gt;at this time, Rejuvacote is &amp;#34;okay.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Recommended by my manicurist.  It is great.  Use as base coat and top coat every other day.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!  My nails grow strong and long with it.  It&#x27;s the only thing that works for me!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, works very well . Would recommend this to everyone. Nails look great. Takes very little time to use.</li>
    <li> I purchase this product all the time and are forever referring people to the web sight because I constantly receive compliments on how long and beautiful my nails are.</li>
    <li> My mother asked me for this.  Her sisters said it worked.  It really did work!!!!</li>
    <li> FAGAZI product!!! Do not buy from Salon Supply Store. I&#x27;ve been using Rejuvacote for almost 7 years, it&#x27;s does wonders. What I received in this 3 pack was not genuine product, all 3 bottles were different colors and consistency. After calling customer service, it was explained that they agree the product in their warehouse is old and would be sending me 3 more free bottles of fresh product true to the quality it should be. 10 minutes later I received a voicemail stating they were NOT resending me anything because they decided the product I originally received is good enough. BS! What I have now is some cloudy weak watered down imitation after paying $25.00.  Dont waste your money on Salon Supply Store rejuvacote</li>
    <li> Love it but burns nails , friend had to stop using because of the pain. It still does the job.</li>
    <li> This is an incredible product for those who have difficult to grow nails.  It works miraculously well.  From no nails, I now have nails that are frequently admired.</li>
    <li> After having acrylic nails for over 6 years and my first and second fungus, I had my nails removed professionally, to give my nails a rest.  My nails were like rice paper, and I was embarrassed to show my once nice nails in public.  I purchased Duri Rejuvacote Growth polish, but after using a few coats, my nails would peel, and I would have to start all over again.  This product was purchased on Amazon with mixed results, but I just had to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw an ad on TV for Pink Armor Nail Gel and have been much more pleased with this product.  My nails have grown out, and look 100% better than they did a few short months ago.  You might be able to purchase this product on Amazon, but  bought mine at Walgreen&#x27;s, in the AS SEEN ON TV Isle.  Good luck......my hands look great..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Duri Rejuvacote for over a year.  I started using it strengthen my fragile nails.  After 30 years of wearing acrylic nails I decided to go back to my natural nails. I knew it would be a challenge as my natural nails are thin and tear easily. After two weeks of coating my nails with Duri I started noticing a difference. My nails are still thin but they are stronger with regular use of Duri.</li>
    <li> These are great and true to their clIm of &#x27;making your nail look great&#x27;. I have since recommended this product to a number of people who loved it as much</li>
    <li> This special nail polish duri heals ur nail if u have whitening round spots  that u think they will never go away, I&#x27;ve had white spots for over a year didn&#x27;t know what to do till my friend told me about duri, believe me it&#x27;s magical? Now all I use is duri, I also put color on top of it, just follow instruction and ull thank me I mean it good luck,</li>
    <li> My nails do feel stronger!</li>
    <li> Duri Rejuvacote is very good for weak nails. I use it a few times each week and it does make a difference!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for approximately 13 yrs.  Before I began using it, I had very soft,splitting , non growing nails.  I must say it is a superior product.  After using it weekly for about 4 weeks, I had to cut back and use it every third day,  This has kept my nails absolutely beautiful.  I do my own manicures, but have professional pedicures and the manicurist has seen my nails for years.  She is amazed at how well they look.  Maybe some day I will have a manicure to show them off.  I have recommended it (the product) to all my friends and they are happy with it also.</li>
    <li> This nail product works great.  If you have peeling or splitting nails this is the product to use.  It takes about 1 month to see results.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Follow directions, changing polish every week. It works!!</li>
    <li> This product works well.  It is better than the other one&#x27;s I used.  Also, the price is lower then the others.</li>
    <li> I have used Duri Rejuvacote Growth Polish Formula for the first time in December 2013 because I had flaky nails that would not grow and would splinter and break.  Since that first application, I have not had one broken nail.  This is the best strengthening formula ever!</li>
    <li> Recommend this product to anyone who has thin Saran-like nails.  Be patient, follow instructions and you will have strong beautiful nails.  This product does not dry your nails.  Remove polish after 7-10 days - cotton pad soaked in remover and wrapped in foil for 5 minutes....do one hand at a time - easy.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing I have found that aided me in growing nails.  I have had them long and beautiful for over a year.  It is not a fluke.  This stuff works and so easy to maintain.  I highly recommend it to anyone who has cracking splitting nails.  Follow the directions and watch in amazement how your nails change almost overnight!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rejuvacote for almost 3 years. It prevents nail cracks that cause my nails to break. Love this product &amp; now several friends are using it.</li>
    <li> After using Rejuvacote for a couple weeks according to the directions, my nails became stronger and the breaking and splitting stopped. After 6 weeks my nail are longer and stronger than they have been for years.</li>
    <li> I have used this for quite sometime and my nails grow fast and strong. Lots of compliments on my nails!</li>
    <li> I had thin nails that would break right at the quick.  I couldn&#x27;t grow them b/c of this.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried everything.  Nailtiques, Sally Hansen, some other one i cannot remember right now…&lt;br /&gt;Nothing would actually fix the problem.  They just tried to add a layer that may prevent the breaking.&lt;br /&gt;THIS actually FIXES the problem.&lt;br /&gt;My nails are strong and don&#x27;t break (watch them break now…)&lt;br /&gt;They are growing and completely heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE love love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Will never use another...</li>
    <li> Love Rejuvacote! Best nail strengthening product ever!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  The first shipment included two broken bottles.  The supplier replaced them right after they were notified.</li>
    <li> Pleased with all my purchases.</li>
    <li> This is the best for your nails Makes the nail strong.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. Use as base and top coat. Really helps my split nails with suggested use.</li>
    <li> This polish works very well, my 3rd reorder</li>
    <li> The price was great.  Also great was the fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Ruined my nails, they started pealing and are still pealing, hope it will clear up once they grow out, would NEVER use this stuff again.</li>
    <li> This is the only polish I have every tried, or anything else, that works on split and peeling nails.  Cures it in about two weeks.</li>
    <li> It takes about a month for results but my nails are much better now.  They were breaking all the time before I used this product. It is a good idea to buy the 3 packs to keep the cost down.</li>
    <li> For the past 60 years I have never had long nails.  They were soft, split and cracked.  I have been using Lot 3 Nail Duri Rejuvacote now for the past 8 months.  I use it most every evening and it only takes 5 minutes.  I now have to file my nails shorter.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> only thing I have found thatt helps my nails grow</li>
    <li> Amazing product!!!  Ive been using this product for a few years now and find it to be the best nail growing system on the market!  Follow instructions, be diligent  &amp; you will no doubt be dissatisfied with Rejuvacote by Duri!  &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> Rejuvacote really stops nail peeling, splitting, side tears and breaks!&lt;br /&gt;I am on my 9th bottle of this product. My nails are incredibly long now (3/4 &amp;#34;!) and strong beyond belief.&lt;br /&gt;I have never had so many compliments on my nails since I started using this product. Start with 2 coats on clean dry nails. Add a coat a day for the next few days. After a week remove with any type of polish remover and start over.&lt;br /&gt;As your nails get longer the product will be less likely to wear off the tip of the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For super results use any brand of nail/cuticle oil at bedtime and let it absorb over night.</li>
    <li> Does what it says it does, makes my nails stronger, which leads to longer and more beautiful nails.&lt;br /&gt;Also just as importantly decent price and it shipped fast!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Good service.</li>
    <li> In just a little time my nails where long and strong.  I no longer have to go to the salon. I am saving plenty of money,</li>
    <li> Best if you problem with nails not growing and breaking use it everyday even on your polish.&lt;br /&gt;It is great.</li>
    <li> this product works!  it was recommended to me by my mother who had it recommended by a friend - i was dubious, but i am now a believer - easy to use with great results.  my nails have always been a bit soft with a tendency to split - this hardener is changing the consistency of my nails to be far more durable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 1 month and It&#x27;s better than the other nail treatments I have tried. However, my nails are extremely bad and  it will probably take a while before I see real results especially my thumbnails.  This product stays on longer and it does keep the nails smooth so that you can apply a color polish easily.</li>
    <li> Great product and it does work even if one is taking meds that can soften the nail but stay with it or the nails get weak or brittle and you have to start all over.</li>
    <li> Have used his product for a number of years--it does wonders for the nails!! (If used according to the directions)</li>
    <li> The product truely helps your nails to grow.  Use it every other day and you won&#x27;t be disappointed. I&#x27;ve tried them all and this is the only one that does what it says.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product and arrived super fast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for three years and I no longer have split or peeling nails. I recommend it highly</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! Helped my nails to grow.</li>
    <li> I use to have chipping and peeling nails. A friend suggested this polish.  It&#x27;s great I now have nails that are stronger, but you must use it daily for at these a month or 2.  BUT it helps you to start enjoying your NEW longer nails.  I buy the 3 pack.  that way you can have a bottle where you needed.  Or just one to travel with.</li>
    <li> My nails are better but still 3 of them have a way to go before they are healthy. I have used  rejuvenate in the past and have faith they will continue to improve.</li>
    <li> My nails look,great after using the product for a couple of months. Recommend to anyone whose nails are split dry or ridged.</li>
    <li> Works the best from lots of other varnishes</li>
    <li> Love the product.  I have been using it for almost a year. My nails have never looked better. This product worked great for me and most everyone who I have introduced to Rejuvacote. There has been one exception. My mother&#x27;s nail did not do well. I was told by my manicurist that there are a few clients who do not experience good results we the product but a majority do. My manicurist uses as my base coat and then I reapply as a top coat either everyday or at least 5 times during the week. It has help in keeping my nail polish from chipping. Overall a great product for me!!!</li>
    <li> It really helped my nails not to beak</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 3 years and it&#x27;s saved my nails!  They were thin and cracking.  Now they stay strong.  Highly Recommend.</li>
    <li> I have very weak nails.....my girlfriend told me about this....and well why not try it, I have tried everything else. And to my happy surprise, it works!  I actually have decent looking nails now.</li>
    <li> My daughter introduced me to this last year. I used to get my nails done and filled in every two weeks. Was getting very expensive. I started applying this to my nails and they have grown like I&#x27;ve never seen before and very strong. My nails were paper thin and I had a habit of biting them, but when I started wearing the Rejuvacote it made them stronger everyday!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep buying this and introducing it to others</li>
    <li> After 2 weeks see the diffrence</li>

    <li> it&#x27;s a very product to nails that are weak.  This Duri makes nails strong and they grow fast.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended at my nail salon,after years of acrylic products on my nails &amp; &amp;#34;thinning&amp;#34; of the nails.&lt;br /&gt;It worked wonders in healing &amp; thickening my nails.This is an amazing product but you need to remove the&lt;br /&gt;acrylics for several months to allow the nails to heal &amp; restore. Well worth the effort!</li>
