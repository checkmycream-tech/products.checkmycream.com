      <li>Thank you so very much.</li>
      <li>After getting a too short haircut from a new hairdresser, I purchased this hot brush to use in place of my old curling iron, it works great</li>
      <li>Her&#x27;s was one that used hot air as a heat source.  </li>
      <li>It does not get hot and burn my fingers or my hair.  </li>
      <li>This item was with a number of others listed as hot air brushes, but it is not.  </li>
      <li>My wife had a Conair hot air curler that quit working.  </li>
      <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>I thought it was a hot air</li>
      <li>This hot curling brush does not heat to hot.</li>
      <li>I was looking under Hot Air Brush driers.</li>
      <li>exactly what she wanted</li>
      <li>I usually have good luck with Conair products, but I returned this one.</li>
      <li>Not that easy to find this item in local stores in the 3/4&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I actually bought this brush from a local store because my previous Conair hot brush had worked perfectly for 7+ years.  </li>
      <li>Because I have fine hair it needs to be much smaller!</li>
      <li>seems to work very well</li>
      <li>It drys my hair fast and gives it tons of body and shine.</li>
      <li>I have thick wavy hair and always had good results with the older model.</li>
      <li>This new model must have been modified, because the heat settings are different now and the metal roller never gets hot enough to do a good, lasting curl even on the hottest setting.  </li>
      <li>Find grippy roller for 3 minutes does a better job and less work.</li>
      <li>I have an older version of this curling brush and wanted a spare to take with me when I travel.  </li>
      <li>I was happy to find one at Amazon ,  as I had been unable to find one in a store.</li>
      <li>They sent me the new style with tipped ends and 25 heat settings.  </li>
      <li>The brush &#x27;comb&#x27; is exactly the length I was looking for however, the product does not get hot enough for my very fine, thin hair.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem hot enough to curl my hair</li>
      <li>but I barely use it as I have curly hair and so doesn&#x27;t really work well with my hair.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough nor  does it curl...</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to curl.</li>
      <li>I have to leave it on the max 10 to get any heat hot enough to use.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t get hot enough for me.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s small enough, but it takes awhile to warm up.</li>
      <li>The picture in the advertisement shows the old style but that&#x27;s not what they send out.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>I ordered the same model as this Hot brush prior to this order &amp; found it to be of the same quality as the VS.</li>

    <li> Product delivered as advertised.</li>
    <li> works great for shorter hair</li>
    <li> This is a good curling iron, the Revlon is the Best curling iron.</li>
    <li> Waste of money I just had to throw it out it cannot curl my hair and the barrel is not well made it has spaces that gets my hair stucked hence breaks my hair. Wish I could give no star.</li>
    <li> I also searched endlessly for this style of curling brush, which is what I am currently using...I was so thrilled to find exactly what I wanted...Unfortunately, I neglected to read the other customer review before ordering as I, too, received a totally different brush than was pictured and described...Please update photo and features to depict what is actually being sold...A big waste of time.</li>
    <li> hard to find these types of curling utensils. very pleased with this.  glad I found it.  works well for me.</li>
    <li> I ordered the same model as this Hot brush prior to this order &amp; found it to be of the same quality as the VS. This one I will keep in my overnite bag &amp; the other for every day use. My overnite bag is always packed; you never know when you will get a call saying &amp;#34;let&#x27;s go&amp;#34; - I&#x27;m prepared, ha ha</li>
    <li> Even on the highest setting, it didn&#x27;t heat up enough to curl my hair.  I usually have good luck with Conair products, but I returned this one.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised.  I didn&#x27;t think they we made anymore.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t get hot enough for me.  Didn&#x27;t care for this one at all.  At least it didn&#x27;t work as well for me.</li>
    <li> Great temp control and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Works great. Not that easy to find this item in local stores in the 3/4&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I expected it to be a hair dryer/curler.  It is just a curler but still a good product.  I&#x27;ll use it</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this hot brush.  It does not get hot and burn my fingers or my hair.  There are several heat control buttons that control the curl.  It is an excellent tool.</li>
    <li> This hot curling brush does not heat to hot. It&#x27;s warm temp, at best. Very disappointing, as I&#x27;ve has Conair hot curling brushes in the past.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, and I feel safer with automatic shut off feature.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>

    <li> Capable of getting very hot, heats fairly quickly and the bristles hold my very fine hair well. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> After getting a too short haircut from a new hairdresser, I purchased this hot brush to use in place of my old curling iron, it works great and I am very happy with it</li>
    <li> No happy with how long it takes to heat up. I have to leave it on the max 10 to get any heat hot enough to use. I would not recommend this product. I had to buy another Revlon curler lime the previous one I had to replace this one. He has way better settings, and it heats up quickly</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s small enough, but it takes awhile to warm up.</li>
    <li> My hair got dangled every time in I have tried to use this...I don&#x27;t recommend!</li>
    <li> only used once. It got intangled in my hair and i had to pull some of my hair out to get loose.</li>
    <li> I have not used it yet, but I can only assume it will work great for me.  I was happy to find one at Amazon ,  as I had been unable to find one in a store.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in the heating element of this product.  I have used Conair 3/4 curling brushes for several years, but this one does not curl my short hair as well as others I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this brush from a local store because my previous Conair hot brush had worked perfectly for 7+ years.  This new model must have been modified, because the heat settings are different now and the metal roller never gets hot enough to do a good, lasting curl even on the hottest setting.  I have thick wavy hair and always had good results with the older model.</li>
    <li> this is not a blower, which is what i was looking for</li>
    <li> bought by my wife . very happy . exactly what she wanted</li>
    <li> Great product, travels well</li>
    <li> I like Conair Products. I have a couple of 3/4 curling irons. One for home, one for travel. I have no problems with this product. I like the auto turnoff because I get in a hurry and…..well you know the story.</li>
    <li> Does not get very warm.  Disappointed</li>
    <li> seems to work very well</li>
    <li> Very good curling iron.</li>
    <li> It did not do what i expected.  I thought it was a hot air brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed in the results</li>
    <li> Nothing really wrong with it, except perhaps that it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as such appliances used to.  Other than that, it&#x27;s perfectly serviceable.</li>
    <li> You did not specify that the operating voltage was 120 volt! The supply voltage is 220 Volts I had to purchase another step down transformer.</li>
    <li> Great product, exactly what i needed! Had been recommended by a friend, and Amazon was the perfect choice and best price!</li>
    <li> This hot brush did not become hot enough to do it good.</li>
    <li> not good, doesn&#x27;t work on short or long hair. Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough nor  does it curl... wasted money.</li>
    <li> Thought this would be helpful to create lift on crown of short head of hair.  Find grippy roller for 3 minutes does a better job and less work.</li>
    <li> It is nice for very short hair.</li>
    <li> Just the right size barrel</li>
    <li> I purchased this one a while ago but I barely use it as I have curly hair and so doesn&#x27;t really work well with my hair. Maybe with a fine hair could work!</li>
    <li> Works great for short hair like mine</li>
    <li> My wife had a Conair hot air curler that quit working.  She asked me to go on line and find another for her.  Her&#x27;s was one that used hot air as a heat source.  This item was with a number of others listed as hot air brushes, but it is not.  Just a heat element that heats the hair for curling.  She wasn&#x27;t satisfied with this item, and has since found what she wanted.  She&#x27;s keeping this one as a &amp;#34;back up&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. Thank you</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem hot enough to curl my hair</li>
    <li> I have had it for a while now and I am still using it, it was cheap but it does work very good !</li>
    <li> Nice replacement for my old curling brush. Could be a bit longer, but otherwise works well and meets my need.</li>
    <li> great for my shorter hair - worked so well that I bought 2 more in case this one ever wears out.  This size is very hard to find.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for my short hair in back and front.  Heats up quickly. I have never had a bad product come from Conair.</li>
    <li> The brush &#x27;comb&#x27; is exactly the length I was looking for however, the product does not get hot enough for my very fine, thin hair.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this curler. Heats quickly and is temperature adjustable. Perfect for my medium short hair.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and at a great price. Thank you so very much. Speedy delivery too!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my needs!</li>
    <li> Conaire should be ashamed to have their name on this product</li>
    <li> Excellent value. It has 10 heat settings, which I don&#x27;t think was mentioned in the description.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to curl.</li>
    <li> Not like it, it did not work at all.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using my new hair brush.  I did find that I have had to turn the heat up all the way to get a great curl.</li>
