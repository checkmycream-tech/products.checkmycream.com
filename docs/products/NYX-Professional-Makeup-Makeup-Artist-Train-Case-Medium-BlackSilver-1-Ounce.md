    <li> I needed a make-up case that would hold all my makeup, pencils, brushes and other accessories, but would also keep my makeup and accessories organized.  This train case did not disappoint.  The trays allowed me to place my makeup discs neatly and organized without fumbling around looking for colors.  The base of the case is spacious enough to hold my BH Cosmetics eye shadow kits and the pocket is wide enough to place my loose brushes.  The mirror is glued on a picture-like frame that allows you to place it on a table and if you prefer, as I have, slip it securely under the bottom of the top cover of the train.  The quality of the train case is very good for its price.  I would highly recommend this train case.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very nice and stylish makeup case. I bought it 2 weeks ago for doing makeup on shooting sessions and used it once so far. Seems to be very solid, does a nice impression on the clients. It arrived on time, the next day of order so that&#x27;s great. However, I thought it would be bigger. This is just a height up to my knee, not including the handle of course.&lt;br /&gt;Nice thing but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d buy it if I knew it was not really large. If this is just the size you are looking for, then that&#x27;s perfect and go for it!</li>
    <li> Good product. Excellent service by the seller.</li>
    <li> Very nice looking and has different shelves for keeping everything organized. Before my makeup was spread out everywhere now it&#x27;s neat and organized.</li>
    <li> My daughter had an arsenal of make-up all over her room and the bathroom, so needless to say this has saved her life, our lives and her big brother&#x27;s life. She now has it all nicely stored inside this case along with her hair ties and a bunch of other things.  She just grabs it and goes.  The rolling case is perfect and the removable handle is also a nice design feature.  The interior design works out perfect because she can see everything without removing anything.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this baed onthe reviews and agree its a nice size adn very sturdy.  I upsized from the carboodles Neat Freak.  My only complaint is that the bottom portion is one large open space the doesnt open outward and i was hoping for more compartments.  But overall a good item.</li>
    <li> This case is a good medium sized case with plenty of room and seems strong enough to use for most travel situations.</li>
    <li> for a birthday present and she loves it! 100% buy it!&lt;br /&gt;good quality, well made, worth the money for sure.</li>
    <li> When i was assambling The handle one piece broken but i am out of time i need to buy this piece can you help me</li>
    <li> All my make up fits in it, It&#x27;s hard and resistant. The problem I had is that it was dented on the back part were the carry on system is hooked, so the case doesn&#x27;t close well.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy.  Larger than I had imagined.  I did not like that the top totally detached.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great case.</li>
    <li> This train case is amazing! Changed my life as an on-site make-up artist, I don&#x27;t know how I got along without it! Thank you!</li>
    <li> After looking for a case for several weeks, I finally decided on this one.  I am a semi-professional make-up artist, and this holds all of my supplies and it easy to transport to and from work.  It looks professional and is easy to handle.  My only complaint would be that the top comes all the way off.  Then I need to find a place to set it during work - I don&#x27;t always have a large space and it can be cumbersome at times.  It was definitely a good product for the cost as well..</li>
    <li> Bought this case for my wife and she loves it! fits everything she&#x27;s got (so far!) and has good build quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s a makeup hobbyist but still travels with her kit sometimes and the wheels and layout make it a breeze. Great product!</li>
    <li> Best case ever! Very dependable!!</li>
    <li> I amusing it for my nail art stuff, and I am living it, every compartment is very useful and has plenty if room!</li>
    <li> Wonderful makeup train case. Fits all my makeup needs for travel!</li>
    <li> I love this train case! I can see all my colors without out having to dig throught them and the bottom is deep enough that all my foundation, moisturizers, etc fit with room to spare.</li>
    <li> I would not suggest this train case at all as I am a traveling wedding makeup artist.  I purchased back in April but had to return due to being defective and received a new one a couple days later.  The train case on pavement wobbles back and forth and will swing to one side which stinks when your walking. The handle that you pull does not seem sturdy at all but I feel it will eventually fall off. I gave this product 2 stars only because it does the job for right now but next year I will for sure have to purchase another case and will go for the Zuca which is more expensive but in the long run you get your money&#x27;s worth. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> I wanted to warn people about this product.  It looks great and holds a lot of stuff.  I bought this as a present this past Christmas for my partner, a professional makeup artist.  He used it for the first time in the middle of January.  After a little over a month of using it, and right after the return period ended, the wheel and handle fell off.  Very very disappointed in the product.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife as she runs around as a makeup artist. It is a well laid out travel case that has kept her more organized and saving her time.</li>
