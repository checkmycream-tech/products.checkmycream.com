      <li>I bought two of these one for my Husband and one for my Son, and they love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I  am  pleased  with  this  trimmer,  and  </li>
      <li>I have had so many problems finding an electric razor for my skin and hair type.</li>
      <li>satisfied  </li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>Okay lets get into the pros and cons, why?</li>
      <li>i love this product; its just what i&#x27;ve been looking for.  </li>
      <li>Its pretty good.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s time and did a pretty good job at it.</li>
      <li>They are a great product, would be great for traveling or everyday use.</li>
      <li>I tend to get razor bumps easily</li>
      <li>It shaves close and trims my beard easily.</li>
      <li>and it still work fine.</li>
      <li>Very happy with this trimmer - sharp and leave a clean cut.</li>
      <li>BUT thats the price you pay for being bump free.</li>
      <li>They worked great especially since I had not shaved for about 5 days</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s been bump free since.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was going to use it as a pre-shave before using the bump free electric shave.  </li>
      <li>but I just use it for light triming around the ears, etc.</li>
      <li>So far so good, I&#x27;ve shaved two times since it arrived and haven&#x27;t had a hair bump yet.</li>
      <li>This product is worth it!</li>
      <li>I purchased this shaver based mostly on its positive reviews.</li>
      <li>These trimmers do not last or cut as good as the 8900.</li>
      <li>Had it for almost a full year now</li>
      <li>You wont get a super close  shave that you would get with a razor</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get super close for shaving</li>
      <li>and this is adequate</li>
      <li>Great trimmer it did end up breaking down after a while</li>
      <li>I would on recommend this as your primary choice for shaving needs as it doesn&#x27;t get very close; however, I does the job in a pinch</li>
      <li>I use my razor primarily for maintenance, keeping my sideburns a reasonable thickness, etc...</li>
      <li>mode where it just prances around not really cutting anything and pulling hair, and then &amp;#34;Gargermel&amp;#34; comes and it kick starts the engine and its roaring with power again.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m talking about a year&#x27;s worth of shaving when I need to</li>
      <li>One problem is that there seems a issue with the battery/power - sometimes it doesn&#x27;t sit right or something</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave close enough if you want this mainly for shaving, but it does do decent trimming of beard and mustache and battery life is great.</li>
      <li>It is kind of noisy for people who would use it for a  long time</li>
      <li>Wash your face with warm water pat dry</li>
      <li>But as a little set of hair clippers, it does a good job.</li>
      <li>Or better still, just shave with a regular razor and allow lots of time for your face to heal.</li>
      <li>But meh, no big deal for the most part.</li>
      <li>This shaver does exactly what it advertises.  </li>
      <li>and I had two guards break on me upon first use; I contacted Wahl&#x27;s customer service and they sent me three replacement guards within four days.</li>
      <li>but it gets pretty close.</li>
      <li>Ordered them from Amazon, arrived quickly, I was very surprised with the shipping speed to APO.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for trimming sideburns and other facial hair, but won&#x27;t give you a close shave.</li>
      <li>I immediately opened them, they came with enough charge that I was able to give a complete close shave right out of the package.</li>
      <li>As a black guy I&#x27;ve been searching for a while for a nice shaver that wouldn&#x27;t leave me all bumped up.</li>
      <li>Absolutely recoment this shaver to anybody with razor bumps.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
      <li>The battery lasts quite a while, and it produces a very close shave.</li>
      <li>It works better than expected.</li>
      <li>If I continue to be hair bump free, I probably buy another shaver as a back up or in case this style is discontinued.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>Very well made and would buy it again.</li>
      <li>but then not use it for days and then really need it one day and the charge is still find for a session.</li>
      <li>There is no bag to put the whole stuff in, and the stand doesn&#x27;t have matching holes for accessories.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a frequent buyer on Amazon but rarely leave reviews.</li>
      <li>My fault for not being more cautious in my purchase, but you&#x27;d think they&#x27;d offer other lengths for purchase as well.</li>
      <li>This is a great razor {my second one in over 30 years} and very long lasting when kept clean a managed properly.</li>
      <li>The new guards work very well, Wahl&#x27;s customer service was prompt and very helpful.</li>
      <li>the only thing i can think of that wolud endear this shaver to me more, is that if it were made for aa batteries only.  </li>
      <li>I mainly use it for trimming and shaping.  </li>
      <li>It does do decent trimming beards and mustashes though.</li>
      <li>The only drawback is it won&#x27;t give you a super close shave.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this cutter for anyone who gets razor bomps.</li>
      <li>YOu ahve to keep it dry clean and short.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>trims  fairly  close,  without  irritating.  </li>
      <li>There was only 1 or 2 times when I first got the shaver that I had it start to go out on me, that just told me that I didn&#x27;t charge it long enough which was fine because its not like I was rushing to go anywhere.</li>
      <li>And could not find the battery in UK stores, it is completely useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and so far not having to worry about changing the battery.</li>
      <li>the battery insdie it kinda rattles around a bit, not a secure fit.</li>
      <li>I suppose it&#x27;s not good if you need to be clean shaven for work, but for a student or for casual use it&#x27;s really great.</li>
      <li>Great product but bad battery.</li>
      <li>but it was for my 80 year old grandfather who will only use things \\&quot;Made in America\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>The last set of trimmers I had did not shave nearly as close.</li>
      <li>To make matters worse, it worsened my keloid scarring and now my face is a mass of scars, requiring many visits to a dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It seems very sharp and cuts exactly what I intend to cut.  </li>
      <li>Due to it not cutting the hair below the surface, you may have to shave daily or every other day.    </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use this everyday but this little unit seems to do just fine.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have had so many problems finding an electric razor for my skin and hair type. This is excellent! Can be used everything and does not irritate my skin or cause any bumps. It also provides as close a shave as I can imagine. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> If you want this for shaving, it doesn&#x27;t shave close enough. It does do decent trimming beards and mustashes though. But as a little set of hair clippers, it does a good job.</li>
    <li> My hubby has trouble with ingrown hairs and has to use a trimmer versus an electric razor.  His face is smoother than ever before and we both LOVE this product!  I recommend it for any ethnic hair types!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a Wahl shaver before and it works best for me. If I shave too close I tend to get razor bumps easily but this shaver cuts close enough that I don&#x27;t and still manage to look like I shaved for the entire day. I haven&#x27;t found anything that does as good a job.</li>
    <li> I have used Wahl shavers for over ten years and they are sturdy and quality products built for daily use. The shaver gives you a close shave without causing bumps, as advertised. Due to it not cutting the hair below the surface, you may have to shave daily or every other day.    The Metro Bump comes with three trim guards and I had two guards break on me upon first use; I contacted Wahl&#x27;s customer service and they sent me three replacement guards within four days. The new guards work very well, Wahl&#x27;s customer service was prompt and very helpful. I would recommend this shaver to anyone looking for a quality cordless shaver that holds a charge for up to three hours.</li>
    <li> Not nearly as sturdy as I expected.  Cannot be used for what I was going to use it for.  I was going to use it as a pre-shave before using the bump free electric shave.  I still found another use for it, as a nose and ear shaver.  Works well as that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for several weeks now and although it doesn&#x27;t get as close as other shavers I&#x27;ve had it also doesn&#x27;t leave me with a cluster of shaving bumps. I need an extremely close shave for my job and this is adequate but I do wish it got just a little closer. As for the noise it is no louder than my hair clippers or any other shaver I&#x27;ve had in the past. I&#x27;ve always preferred wahl products and plan to buy another model to see if I can get a little closer.</li>
    <li> Holds little charge, and runs very slow. I have plenty of Wahl shavers and they seem to be getting worse in quality.</li>
    <li> No razor burn, bumps and give a nice close shave. Will even take you to bald if you need it. Great razor</li>
    <li> I  am  pleased  with  this  trimmer,  and  trims  fairly  close,  without  irritating.  satisfied  with  this  product.  it  keeps  a  charge.</li>
    <li> Decent trimmer, not very good for stubble, but there is one major problem: you can&#x27;t wash it. It&#x27;ll get all rusty.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave close enough if you want this mainly for shaving, but it does do decent trimming of beard and mustache and battery life is great.</li>
    <li> So far so good, I&#x27;ve shaved two times since it arrived and haven&#x27;t had a hair bump yet. I can&#x27;t believe that I didn&#x27;t find this sooner. I&#x27;m a 30 year old black male that has been struggling with hair bumps for the last 5 year. I&#x27;ve tried almost everything but these clippers are the only thing that works.  If I continue to be hair bump free, I probably buy another shaver as a back up or in case this style is discontinued.  Thank you Wahl and Amazon.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say anything about the craftmanship of the product because I purchased it as a gift but it was for my 80 year old grandfather who will only use things \\&quot;Made in America\\&quot;. He hasn&#x27;t complained about it so I&#x27;m assuming all is well.</li>
    <li> I like this shaver. It shaves close and trims my beard easily. I&#x27;ve used a lot of beard trimmers and this one has been by far the best.</li>
    <li> I found that this product shaves extremely close for a trimmer. I&#x27;d say if you want to use it instead of shaving, go for it. The last set of trimmers I had did not shave nearly as close. I suppose it&#x27;s not good if you need to be clean shaven for work, but for a student or for casual use it&#x27;s really great.</li>
    <li> It worked once. After that it wouldn&#x27;t charge enough to be used again. I spent a lot of time looking for a shaver that would prevent razor bumps because my guy has sensitive skin. I&#x27;m really disappointed that this didn&#x27;t work. What&#x27;s even worse is that my guy had already thrown out all the packaging materials. I can&#x27;t even return this crap. So, now I have no choice but to try and find a battery for this thing and hope that fixes the issue.</li>
    <li> Shaves and trims well,convenient,   although oiling it each time is annoying.  There is no bag to put the whole stuff in, and the stand doesn&#x27;t have matching holes for accessories. It&#x27;s a \\&quot;get your own box\\&quot; product, stupid.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a frequent buyer on Amazon but rarely leave reviews. I purchased this shaver based mostly on its positive reviews. While it does work well, it only comes with three shave lengths, all of them very short. I use my razor primarily for maintenance, keeping my sideburns a reasonable thickness, etc... The the lengths provided are all extremely short (3/16th\\&quot; being the longest). That would be fine if there were a way to purchase longer lengths, but I&#x27;m unable to find longer lengths offered for sale. So basically this is useless to me seeing as they only offer short shave lengths that don&#x27;t work for me. My fault for not being more cautious in my purchase, but you&#x27;d think they&#x27;d offer other lengths for purchase as well.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says giving my head a face a close shave with out the dreaded painful bumps. You wont get a super close  shave that you would get with a razor but it gets pretty close. I would recommend to any black people that have problems with razor bumps</li>
    <li> Great product. Had it for almost a full year now and I now decide to write a product review on it. It gets the job done, plain and simple. As a black guy I&#x27;ve been searching for a while for a nice shaver that wouldn&#x27;t leave me all bumped up. Well this one is it. Occasionally and I do mean OCCASIONALLY I might get a little hair bump. But meh, no big deal for the most part. Okay lets get into the pros and cons, why? Because everybody loves pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Comes with 3 different length guards&lt;br /&gt;Rechargeable battery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Well for some this will be a con. Depending on your shaving session, you might need to charge it for a while. For me I usually charge it for about 90 minutes to 2 hours for a 10-20 minute shaving session. Now you might feel that excessive and if you&#x27;re always on the run this might not be the shaver for you. However I&#x27;m not sure how long this shaver holds its charge so you could have it charged but then not use it for days and then really need it one day and the charge is still find for a session. Try out different charge times to see what works for you. Some people might shave slower/faster than me. There was only 1 or 2 times when I first got the shaver that I had it start to go out on me, that just told me that I didn&#x27;t charge it long enough which was fine because its not like I was rushing to go anywhere. You should plan in advance when using this product to prevent it happening to you. 90 minutes to 2 hours charging time(give or take) just find something else to do until then.&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay now lets speak on the rechargeable battery. Let me tell you something. The shaver came with a battery(and of course the charger) and I haven&#x27;t had to change those batteries yet! I&#x27;m talking about a year&#x27;s worth of shaving when I need to and so far not having to worry about changing the battery. This product is worth it! You have coarse hair on your face and you&#x27;re worried aboutbumping up? Get this product!</li>
    <li> If razor burn has plagued you the Wahl shaver is the answer. I used to  shave once or twice a week because it tore my face up. I can now shave every day without the pain and discomfort of razor burn. The only drawback is it won&#x27;t give you a super close shave. Over all a good product.</li>
    <li> This shaver has performed well and now I need to replace it.  I have been using this style for approximately 30 years.</li>
    <li> Great beard trimmer, I bump easy and this does a good job of preventing that.</li>
    <li> This shaver does exactly what it advertises.  It doesn&#x27;t last forever so you have to plan to re-purchase every 6 months or so for daily shaving.  A small price to pay for the value.</li>
    <li> Since I bought this Item I only used it twice. When the Battery run out it did not charge again. And could not find the battery in UK stores, it is completely useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every attempt I made to purchase the battery online (including Amazon) was not successful.&lt;br /&gt;It actually discourage me from purchasing any item online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please if anyone have idea on where I can buy the battery within England should let me know.</li>
    <li> Great product but bad battery.</li>
    <li> I was upset when I arrived to my location, plugged up my Andis Outliners with the power converter and to my surprise thought they were going to explode! Sounded like I was holding a weed eater next to my face. So I immediately started researching an alternative and ran across the Wahl 9940-600 Metro Bump Prevent Shaver with T-Blade. Ordered them from Amazon, arrived quickly, I was very surprised with the shipping speed to APO. I could not wait to use them. I immediately opened them, they came with enough charge that I was able to give a complete close shave right out of the package. They worked great especially since I had not shaved for about 5 days (Shaving Waver!)I can charge them once and they will last a while.  Overall, I would definetly recommend these clippers. They are a great product, would be great for traveling or everyday use. I will save these for when I deploy or travel instead of carrying my Andis with me. Don&#x27;t let the price fool you, again they are a great product that gives a close and smooth shave.</li>
    <li> It gets closer than any trimmer I&#x27;ve had before.  I mainly use it for trimming and shaping.  It doesn&#x27;t get super close for shaving but I didn&#x27;t expect it to so that&#x27;s not a problem for me.</li>
    <li> Get the Wahl 8900. You can thank me later. These trimmers do not last or cut as good as the 8900. The battery flat out sucks. Spend the few extra bucks for the 8900. I promise you will be happy you did.</li>
    <li> I struggle with a portable shaving solution when I don&#x27;t have regular setup and I would honestly suggest this a great option for males seeking a solution that will not cause razor bumps and irritations.  The product came in good condition and I was happy with the quality.  I would on recommend this as your primary choice for shaving needs as it doesn&#x27;t get very close; however, I does the job in a pinch (actually it does not pinch).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you find a solution that works for you!</li>
    <li> my boyfriend don&#x27;t use it but i know it is gd, because i know the brand is gd, i&#x27;ve used it before</li>
    <li> I bought two of these one for my Husband and one for my Son, and they love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t prevent bumping</li>
    <li> I am happy with this cutter. It shaves close enough but not too close to cause razor bumps. It hold the battery charge the longest of any cutter I have used, including the Andis.I would highly recommend this cutter for anyone who gets razor bomps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for years, and this is the best one I&#x27;ve owned. I hate the wired ones, so this cordless one was already ahead of the game. The battery lasts quite a while, and it produces a very close shave. It&#x27;s not a totally clean shave, but it&#x27;s like a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. I would definitely buy another one if mine ever died or got lost.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product expecting a high quality Wahl product,on receiving it worked fine , not the best or sharpest shave in the world but it was ok,and then about two weeks after receiving the product, it stops working just comes on and shuts off for itself :| , like what the hell, I am so dissapointed,I usually buy Andis I wanted to give Wahl a chance, and look what happened</li>
    <li> i love this product; its just what i&#x27;ve been looking for.  the only thing i can think of that wolud endear this shaver to me more, is that if it were made for aa batteries only.  i don&#x27;t care for re-chargers.</li>
    <li> For eyars Ive tried products and shavers and so on. I recomended this shaver to my little brother soon as he started shaving at 16 so he would not go thru the same strugll eive been. He&#x27;s been bump free since.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately you will never have that baby face with this shaver BUT thats the price you pay for being bump free. Absolutely recoment this shaver to anybody with razor bumps.&lt;br /&gt;1 wet your face exfoliate with a brush or exoliator,releasing entrapped hairs&lt;br /&gt;2 pat dry,&lt;br /&gt;3 shave against the grain&lt;br /&gt;4 Wash your face with warm water pat dry and thats it! dont apply any thing,it will only worsen your condition.Mostourizer make the hairs hurve down to the skin.YOu ahve to keep it dry clean and short.&lt;br /&gt;I dont give 5 stars cause that would be a close shave without bumps</li>
    <li> Great trimmer it did end up breaking down after a while but it served it&#x27;s time and did a pretty good job at it. The on and off switch came out of place I doctored it up so it kept working but great trimmer besides that. Used it for cutting my hair a couple times too not exactly what it&#x27;s made for but it did a better job than my Andis clippers made for cutting hair. These seem sharper somehow. Anyway I was happy with them</li>
    <li> Its pretty good. One problem is that there seems a issue with the battery/power - sometimes it doesn&#x27;t sit right or something and then the machine goes into what I call &amp;#34;smurf&amp;#34; mode where it just prances around not really cutting anything and pulling hair, and then &amp;#34;Gargermel&amp;#34; comes and it kick starts the engine and its roaring with power again. Battery is fully charged, it just seems it a connection thing, the battery insdie it kinda rattles around a bit, not a secure fit. A bit annoying when you in the middle of grooming and the engine dies on you.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor {my second one in over 30 years} and very long lasting when kept clean a managed properly.</li>
    <li> Having suffered from bumps since I began shaving, I thought this razor will help. It didn&#x27;t. To make matters worse, it worsened my keloid scarring and now my face is a mass of scars, requiring many visits to a dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re buying this to prevent bumps, look somewhere else. Or better still, just shave with a regular razor and allow lots of time for your face to heal. Once you get keloids, you can&#x27;t treat them. Ever.</li>
    <li> Great service , I have been using this shaver and I did bought other shavers that wouldn&#x27;t last but still have this shaver. I love it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this everyday but this little unit seems to do just fine.  I like the wider head. It is kind of noisy for people who would use it for a  long time but I just use it for light triming around the ears, etc. and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  It seems very sharp and cuts exactly what I intend to cut.  I&#x27;ve had some that didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this trimmer - sharp and leave a clean cut. Very well made and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Works great for hair trimming. Just keep in mind it&#x27;s not an electric shaver. It&#x27;s great for trimming sideburns and other facial hair, but won&#x27;t give you a close shave. I only use it occasionally, but it&#x27;s been a couple years since I bought it and it still work fine.</li>
    <li> replaced my old ones, this is an excellent tool for those of us who can not use razors and also an excellent trimmer</li>
    <li> It works better than expected. It gives a very close shave but it´s a little noisy (that´s why i am giving it four instead of five stars)</li>
