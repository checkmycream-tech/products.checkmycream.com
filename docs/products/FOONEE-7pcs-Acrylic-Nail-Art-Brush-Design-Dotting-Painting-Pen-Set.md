      <li>but if I would have spent a little more I could have gotten better ones.</li>
      <li>i hope this seller evaluates their products more thumbs down on all levels</li>
      <li>I got these brushes in hopes that I could do little details on my nails with them, but most of the time the bristles just spread out.</li>
      <li>They match exactly to some dotting tools I already bought a while back.</li>
      <li>very practical n totally meet my expectations, will order again.</li>
      <li>I use acetone or nail polish remover to clean my brushes, and they haven&#x27;t dried out or anything.</li>
      <li>did I mention the pretty pink handles?&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
      <li>So far i&#x27;ve used this 2 brushes one of the bigger for doing gel nail extensions and 1 to do a french tip it a couple colors.</li>
      <li>They are all labeled with different sizing numbers, but the only major size difference is between 2 and 12.</li>

    <li> Just as described! So far, so good! I&#x27;ve used them to perfect smile lines and apply glitter/gel mixes. I use acetone or nail polish remover to clean my brushes, and they haven&#x27;t dried out or anything.</li>

    <li> These are great, inexpensive, nail art design brushes. 7 brushes for less that a dollar each is a great price. That said, most of mine looked to be really similar in brush head  size. They are all labeled with different sizing numbers, but the only major size difference is between 2 and 12. I&#x27;m not worried about that though, since they work well, fan out nicely, the bristles have all held up with no fall out.&lt;br /&gt;And did I mention the pretty pink handles?&lt;br /&gt;Nice product, nice price!</li>
    <li> These are some really nice brushes. They hold their shape well and are comfortable in the hand. Will definitely order another set when these need replaced!</li>
    <li> So far i&#x27;ve used this 2 brushes one of the bigger for doing gel nail extensions and 1 to do a french tip it a couple colors. The end resuelts was a smooth shed free strokes with me needing to work on speed and some bumps but from what i can tell any problems i&#x27;m having are from my own skills and not these. The price is good the ship time isn&#x27;t bad not the best but not bad.</li>
