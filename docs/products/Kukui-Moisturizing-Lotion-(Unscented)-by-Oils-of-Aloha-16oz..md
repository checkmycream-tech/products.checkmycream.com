    <li> I bought some Kukui lotion while in Hawaii, then just had to have more when that supply was gone.  As with most things, Amazon had it and it was delivered in just a few days.</li>
    <li> I order this for my husband, who has eczema.  This lotion works and feels wonderful on the skin.  Highly recommend to everyone!</li>
    <li> My husband and I love Kukui lotion! We usually buy it when we are in Hawaii, but we ran out before we could get there, so we looked for it on-line. What a big surprise to find it at Amazon, and for a great price!</li>
    <li> I bought this whilst on holiday and Hawaii and I think it&#x27;s brilliant as my daughter suffers from eczema from time to time. It really helps to take away the itch and really clears up the patches. We were so pleased that we ordered a big bottle. Would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> This lotion works wonders for my daughter&#x27;s eczema.  It works better even than what was prescribed by the dermatologist, and doesn&#x27;t have all the scary side effects of those medicines.</li>
    <li> I tried this in Hawaii after a whale-watching trip, from a sampler. Even though it&#x27;s not the after-sun product, it relieves mild sunburn. It&#x27;s great for dry skin and any skin irritation, too. I live in Arizona and have been using it for 6 months. It&#x27;s the best skin product I&#x27;ve ever tried. It also absorbs quickly. I use the unscented as I am allergic to a lot of perfumes, but I tried a sampler of the scented one also--no problem. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have been getting this oil for about 8 years now and before I had it I had horrible eczema on my hands. No prescribed oil or lotion worked for me. I saw this company Oils of Aloha online and thought i would try it out. It worked miracles for me. Anyone who has eczema please just try out this lotion or the pure kukui nut oil. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because of the great reviews and I am not disappointed.  The lotion is very soothing and keeps my hands moisturized for a long time.  Minus one star because it is an expensive lotion, but I guess it&#x27;s pricey because it&#x27;s only made in Hawaii.  In any case, I will probably order more when my supply runs out!!  :-)</li>
    <li> This product saved my wife&#x27;s sanity! She has been looking for literally decades to find something that works for her atopic dermatitis. She had tried many oils, lotions, prescription steroid creams, etc, to no avail; they generally made the problem worse. At first, she was skeptical that kukui nut lotion would work for her. Unbelievably, it cured her long-standing atopic dermatitis around her neck and hands almost immediately. Now she uses this product on her whole body, including face and scalp - her skin has become very soft and smooth after just a few weeks. She extols the virtue of of kukui nut and Oils of Aloha on an almost daily basis!</li>
    <li> Started buying this on vacation.  Love it, goes on light and is very nice after being in the sun.  Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years it is the best !! I use only Oils of Aloha since going to Kona 15 years ago !</li>
    <li> I have eczema on my hands, feet, and knees and this kukui moisturizing lotion has considerably helped my very dry skin.  I Love it and have recommended it to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> Kukui nut lotion and oil is great for all skin types, especially sensitive. A bit expensive, but this size bottle (16oz) lasts me about 5 months.  Oils of Aloha makes wonderful products.  Highly recommend the oil also!</li>
    <li> It  stayed fairly good  for a short time but now is beginning to smell. It is turning rancid also. this product was $40.00&lt;br /&gt;plus shipping. too much money  for  a product that I can&#x27;t use anymore than I could use the moistering cream.&lt;br /&gt;Misrepresented.</li>
    <li> this is aproduct I have used for years and ahve is fvery helpful for skin dryness and various types of skin irrritations.</li>
    <li> This lotion was first purchased in Hawaii and I was told it is very good for psoriasis.  If you have that problem, you&#x27;s try anything!  It helped a little but my problem was on a larger scale.  Pam</li>
    <li> I have been a user of the lotion ever since I purchased it at a health food store in Hawaii.  It is a an all purpose lotion, which is wonderful.</li>
    <li> So glad I found this on Amazon!  Tried it in Maui and loved it, but couldn&#x27;t bring much home in carryon.  It works better than a prescription medication on my husbands problem skin on his leg.  Also, could only buy a small 4 oz. bottle in Maui, this is a big 16 oz and saves some money over the small size.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I have ever used. Discovered it on a trip to Hawaii. There really is something special about kukui oil, it does wonders for the skin. I have eczema and since using this lotion have had no breakouts. I will be using this from now on!</li>
    <li> We had used this product in Hawaii and loved it and when we found out we could purchase it here we were very happy</li>
    <li> Best stuff I have ever put on my face.  Only thing better is putting it on in Hawaii.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of Kukui lotion. My first was purchased in Maui at the recommendation of a friend whose family has been using this product for years. I really like how my skin feels after using it.</li>
    <li> best skin conditioner ever.......mildly scented...keeps skin soft &amp; comfortable</li>
    <li> Bought a small bottle of this oil in Hawaii at recommendation of a local.  Loved it!  Very absorbing without being greasy.  So when I got home, I looked for a bigger size bottle since I definitely wanted more.  For sunburn, for dry skin...kukui oil is the best.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!  I first bought it when I was sunburned, and the redness of my skin left so quickly I was amazed.&lt;br /&gt;Now I use it everyday and feel like it leaves my skin looking brighter!</li>
