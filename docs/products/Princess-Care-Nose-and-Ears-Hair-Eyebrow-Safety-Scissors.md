      <li>They protect the delicate area and make it safe to cut the hairs easily and quickly.</li>

      <li>Nose hair trimmers do become essential eventually, and these ones are doing the trick for me just fine.</li>

      <li>The tip ends are so big that it is fit for a horse.</li>
      <li>I try to document pluses and minuses as I see them and contribute a video demo to add as much information as I can to help you make a decision.</li>
      <li>Delivery was fast also.</li>
      <li>Have an older friend who wanted</li>
      <li>2nd gripe is that he curved tip is kind of large, making it difficult to safely reach some areas inside my nose.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>These scissors are not sharp enough to deal with the fine hairs.  </li>
      <li>they aren&#x27;t sharp AT ALL, so he is able to get as far in his nose as he needs to go to cut the hairs where they no longer bother him and 2)</li>
      <li>handles fit my small hands comfortably, but someone with bug thumbs will be less comfortable.  </li>
      <li>It is even better than my old more expensive kit I had purchased from Sally&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>The blunt rounded tips make me feel much safer operating the scissors near my eye.  </li>
      <li>very sharp, has not rusted so far, moves easily when cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>At first I was skeptical, but after cleaning &amp; use they are just fine and do exactly what I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And the safety tip looked like a great idea as well, but they make the tip much larger and difficult to maneuver.</li>
      <li>After 2 months of use I find myslef using the old duller pair instead.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not hold, heck I feel like I&#x27;m still in my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>The scissors cut right down to the rounded safety tips.&lt;br</li>
      <li>You can easily cut the delicate area inside the nose if you are not extremely careful.</li>
      <li>so I could only try putting the scissors near my nostrils to see if I could cut hairs in the nostrils</li>
      <li>I noticed a review where someone said the scissors did not fit into the nostril, so I figured it would be useful to provide these</li>
      <li>a lot of hard hours and days and years of time spent reviewing, I found myself in the top 10 reviewers on Amazon.</li>
      <li>They are not too tight and not too loose, they have just the right amount of friction.</li>

<li> They are not too tight and not too loose, they have just the right amount of friction.</li>
<li> Then, besides the smudges and grime on the scissors, the screw hinge is not set properly and the action is not smooth - they are rubbing together/grinding just before they close, which causes them to snap together.</li>
<li> A friend was fixing something in the tank of my toilet yesterday and reached to use this scissors.</li>
<li> [[VIDEOID:moHJZW6I24PIVX]]These scissors have large blunt tips which make it much safer to do cutting near delicate areas.</li>
<li> The width of each rounded tip is 1/8\\&quot;, when the scissors are closed the total width is slightly over 1/8\\&quot;.  </li>
<li> I have a big nose, and these things can not fit inside of my nostrils.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Total length is 3.5\\&quot;, shears are slightly curved up, ends are rounded and blunt, the blades are 1\\&quot; long.</li>
<li> I bought these all together as a package with the other kits.</li>
<li> /&gt;The blades are sharp and cut well.  </li>
<li> He use to cut with small regular ones and he was so scare to do it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
<li> I bought these specifically for the hubby because he had an old pair of scissors that were 1) too sharp to get as far in his nose as he needed to, to cut his hairs correctly and 2) they were getting to where they weren&#x27;t cutting worth a crap.</li>
<li> Might have gotten a single bad item, since others are rating them highly, but was not my experience.</li>
<li> These are physically small for those that are wondering.</li>
<li> I like having littler scissors around for small things.</li>
<li> Not safe for delicate areas like the nose or ears.</li>
<li> I have used many battery nose hair cutters and was always disappointed because they pulled instead of cutting.  </li>
<li> Too thick, hard to use and very stiff.</li>
<li> My husband cuts nose hair and ear hair with this one.&lt;br /&gt;safe way to cut hair from nose, do not use regular scissor to cut nose hair, dangerous.  </li>
<li> This means to cut a hair within a nostril the scissors will need a minimum opening of 3/8\\&quot; (1/8 for each blade plus the space needed to open the scissors for cutting).  </li>
<li> My nostrils are small and, unfortunately, the curved tip is on the big-ish side.  </li>
<li> But unfortunately my body doesn&#x27;t realize that.</li>
<li> The curved tip prevents cutting of the skin but allows the scissors to cut the unwanted hair in the nose and ears.  </li>
<li> These were dirty on arrival in the plastic ziploc bag.</li>
<li> I am using it to trim a crazy hair that grows out of control in one of my eyebrows.</li>
<li> course, I like the blunt tip, and also use it for cutting matts out of my dogs and kitty.</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;to trim her husbands face hair, but was afraid to with pointed scissors.  </li>

    <li> It&#x27;s fine for the price, but it doesn&#x27;t cut any better than an other pair of smallish scissors.  This is just a pair of kids scissors.</li>
    <li> Good product,well built and easy to use.The design allows for safe trimming in that sensitive area of your nose. Delivery was fast also.</li>
    <li> what a great product.  high quality and safe.  The curved tip prevents cutting of the skin but allows the scissors to cut the unwanted hair in the nose and ears.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Tip was more straight than curved which I like better anyway. All in all an excellent value for the money.</li>
    <li> My nostrils are small and, unfortunately, the curved tip is on the big-ish side.  Great for eyebrows though.  I&#x27;m still looking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not hold, heck I feel like I&#x27;m still in my early 20&#x27;s. But unfortunately my body doesn&#x27;t realize that. Nose hair trimmers do become essential eventually, and these ones are doing the trick for me just fine. They are constructed fine, cut fine and are safety tip. I was less than enthusiastic that they arrived in a zip lock bag. At first I was skeptical, but after cleaning &amp; use they are just fine and do exactly what I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By a lot of hard hours and days and years of time spent reviewing, I found myself in the top 10 reviewers on Amazon. This wasn&#x27;t a goal or self promotion, but by nose-down focused reviewing. I occasionally get contacted by manufacturers or sellers who appreciate my way of reviewing and ask if I&#x27;ll consider reviewing a product for them, with no obligation or cost. This is one of those products. I assure you that I review what I want, when I want, how I want, in order to share what I feel is the most accurate useful information.</li>
    <li> These can not possibly be nose scissors.  I have a big nose, and these things can not fit inside of my nostrils.  I lost them, or else I would have returned them.</li>
    <li> My husband cuts nose hair and ear hair with this one.&lt;br /&gt;safe way to cut hair from nose, do not use regular scissor to cut nose hair, dangerous.  He use to cut with small regular ones and he was so scare to do it.&lt;br /&gt;This one is perfect for nose and ear since tip is round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work smoothly.  Cheap construction.</li>
    <li> I have used many battery nose hair cutters and was always disappointed because they pulled instead of cutting.  These scissors work very well and the rounded end is very safe , A very good investment and I could not find them at any place in town except at beauty salons and they were more expensive.  Thank You .</li>
    <li> These scissors are not sharp enough to deal with the fine hairs.  I do like the blunt tips and wished the blades were sharper.</li>
    <li> No Problems! Fast Delivery! A++++</li>
    <li> I bought these specifically for the hubby because he had an old pair of scissors that were 1) too sharp to get as far in his nose as he needed to, to cut his hairs correctly and 2) they were getting to where they weren&#x27;t cutting worth a crap. So these were the perfect replacement because 1) they aren&#x27;t sharp AT ALL, so he is able to get as far in his nose as he needs to go to cut the hairs where they no longer bother him and 2) they cut just they way they should. These are physically small for those that are wondering. They are even smaller than a pair of haircutting scissors. Anyway, if you know a man who is having the same issue, buy him these. They will work for ALL nose sizes. lol</li>
    <li> Nice and smooth action, perfect size for a quick clip, love the blunted ends. Nice and sharp, these scissors are very comfortable to use. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I like having littler scissors around for small things. Thus rounded tips are great for the nose and ears. These particular scissors function fine but  ascetically they had a surface flaw. They don&#x27;t look great but they work. Therefore 4 stars.</li>
    <li> These nose hair clippers are just OK.  Biggest gripe is that when you are scissoring, they don&#x27;t move back-and-forth easily (kind of sticky).  2nd gripe is that he curved tip is kind of large, making it difficult to safely reach some areas inside my nose.  I purchased this pair plus a pair of Tweezerman nose hair clippers at the same time.  The Tweezerman scissors are much, much better.</li>
    <li> These were dirty on arrival in the plastic ziploc bag. Does not look like they were cleaned after being manufactured. Then, besides the smudges and grime on the scissors, the screw hinge is not set properly and the action is not smooth - they are rubbing together/grinding just before they close, which causes them to snap together. Not safe for delicate areas like the nose or ears. Returning them. Might have gotten a single bad item, since others are rating them highly, but was not my experience.</li>
    <li> They arrived quickly, were precise, sharp and attractive. There was no play in the handles. I&#x27;m very pleased with these. Hopefully they&#x27;ll last a good long while.</li>
    <li> A nice pair of scissors. Well made and does the job.</li>
    <li> I ordered this specifically for nose hair and it does the job! I have no idea what will happen if it gets more blunt, but I think the thing is probably not to use it for anything besides facial and nose hair. A friend was fixing something in the tank of my toilet yesterday and reached to use this scissors. I GRABBED his hand and stopped him!!! Lol, I refrained from telling him exactly what it was for, but did tell him not to use it for handywork! So I recommend this product and give it five stars. I have used the battery operated ones as well, but this is probably safer, I think.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moHJZW6I24PIVX]]These scissors have large blunt tips which make it much safer to do cutting near delicate areas. I am using it to trim a crazy hair that grows out of control in one of my eyebrows. The blunt rounded tips make me feel much safer operating the scissors near my eye.  I don&#x27;t have nose hairs so I could only try putting the scissors near my nostrils to see if I could cut hairs in the nostrils and I think it would work. I was able to open blades 1/8\\&quot; without touching the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total length is 3.5\\&quot;, shears are slightly curved up, ends are rounded and blunt, the blades are 1\\&quot; long. The width of each rounded tip is 1/8\\&quot;, when the scissors are closed the total width is slightly over 1/8\\&quot;.  This means to cut a hair within a nostril the scissors will need a minimum opening of 3/8\\&quot; (1/8 for each blade plus the space needed to open the scissors for cutting).  I noticed a review where someone said the scissors did not fit into the nostril, so I figured it would be useful to provide these measurements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handles fit my small hands comfortably, but someone with bug thumbs will be less comfortable.  The Amazon description describes packaging as \\&quot;loose\\&quot;, what this means is that they arrive in a plastic zip lock baggy with a bar code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are sharp and cut well.  They are not too tight and not too loose, they have just the right amount of friction. The scissors cut right down to the rounded safety tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received a sample for review. Getting a sample does not effect what I say. I try to document pluses and minuses as I see them and contribute a video demo to add as much information as I can to help you make a decision.</li>
    <li> They came in the mail, thought they would be bigger, but they did a very good job of trimming.  Have an older friend who wanted&lt;br /&gt;to trim her husbands face hair, but was afraid to with pointed scissors.  Used these and now wants a pair.</li>
    <li> The tip ends are so big that it is fit for a horse. I have yet to figure out where I can use it.</li>
    <li> I have used this many times and love it.  It is even better than my old more expensive kit I had purchased from Sally&#x27;s.  Free Shipping too, can&#x27;t beat it.  I bought these all together as a package with the other kits.</li>
    <li> Too thick, hard to use and very stiff.</li>
    <li> Bought this scissor to replace a straight blade scissor I had used for 15 years. I thought the curved blade would make it easier to use but ii&#x27;s actually more difficult to control. And the safety tip looked like a great idea as well, but they make the tip much larger and difficult to maneuver. After 2 months of use I find myslef using the old duller pair instead.</li>
    <li> It replaces a pair of scissors that I have used for more than fifteen years that were finally wearing out.</li>
    <li> very sharp, has not rusted so far, moves easily when cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I like the blunt tip, and also use it for cutting matts out of my dogs and kitty.</li>
    <li> It is difficult to cut the hairs in the nose in a safe manner. You can easily cut the delicate area inside the nose if you are not extremely careful. With these scissors, you don&#x27;t have that problem anymore. They protect the delicate area and make it safe to cut the hairs easily and quickly.</li>
