<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> workd very well.  has sure helped my itchy scalp and that means a lot.</li>
    <li> Works great and heats up very nicely and warm my entire head even the lower back.</li>
    <li> As a hair stylist I was looking for something that would take my procedures to the next level!! This cap helps conditioning treatments penetrate the hair better than a hood dryer!! I also use it for color penetration on gray hair and with my semi permanents and cellophanes!! I don&#x27;t think there is any issue with only certain areas of the cap getting hot as other reviewers have stated because just the act of the cap being on your head is helping your head create more heat all the way around!! I have taken the cap off and felt their napes and it is just as hot as the top even tho the cap itself may not be as hot in that area. My clients like the cap a lot better than sitting under the dry air hood dryer. They tell me it feels more comfortable and they can hear better (so watch out what you say lol)  It just It also free&#x27;s up dryer space and works well with my older clients who I may not want to move back and forth from shampoo bowl to dryer or from styling chair to dryer. I just let them stay in the same chair and bring the cap to them. They can even lay back, so I can deep condition them and do another service on them like an eyebrow wax!! The only reason I took away a star is because the strap doesn&#x27;t do much to hold it in place and not all my clients can get it on their heads!! They could have definitely made it a little bit bigger!! MOST clients can fit it but beware if you have an ethnic client with a whole lot of natural hair! maybe if you twist it real tight and get it to sit right on top you can fit it on!! Some clients don&#x27;t like the way it looks and some are embarrassed to wear it but I&#x27;m like hey that&#x27;s the price of beauty!! It would probably look better if it was black tho!! I think it&#x27;s just not as common to wear thus people are more self conscious in a salon setting!! Lastly, the plug will dig into your neck at a certain angle, just make sure a towel is on the neck and it will prevent this! I now can&#x27;t do without it and most of my clients are used to ittoo and love something new that will benefit their hair!!!</li>
    <li> My husband asked for this item, and LOVES it...20+ year hair stylist.  If he&#x27;s happy then I&#x27;m ELATED!!!</li>
    <li> This product is really perfect for me :) Let say i am the kind of person that not going to parlor main reasons i cannot afford it :) whew! but through this Thermal Spa CHC i feel great, now my hair not like before dry and dull.  its really good!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this a year ago and I have used it like 5 times, It doesn&#x60;t heat up evenly, so it takes a long time for it to work. I will keep it around ,now i prefer to go the steam room and put on my hair treatment and it works almost right away,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for this conditioning cap for a long time and I&#x27;m glad I found it.  This heat cap distributes heat evenly and its very comfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> I do have to say that I like the product but it doesn&#x27;t heat the hair evenly. The back of my head isn&#x27;t as warm as the top/crown area. It does a great job otherwise. It heats at a  reasonable temperature and does wonders to help condition hair to a very soft finish.</li>
    <li> Buying this cap made me realize how much my hair needed heat to really absorb conditioner. I mean the plastic edges can be a little annoying, but just clip your hair at the top of your head so your older hair gets more of the heat (and conditioner absorbing), but really the head will radiate all over your head. This cap is great and works perfectly. I won&#x27;t knock the production for trying to make sure the cap fits most head sizes.</li>
    <li> The cap heated well.  A little too hot around the ears.  I did on occasion wish it were cordless, other than that, it worked well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of heat caps for deep conditioning treatments. They allow the mixture to really penetrate the hair shaft, which is great. This heat cap is nothing that spectacular but there is also nothing wrong with it! Good price. Good product. Good results.</li>
    <li> works but uncomfortable to wear</li>
    <li> I love this Heat Cap! I had a friend who had this same one and I decided to get one for myself and I&#x27;m glad I did. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really get warm on top of he head. The sides and back works pretty good.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time for cellophanes and deep conditioning. I had a salon wreck my hair a month or so ago and now I have to wait for it to recover to do my color again, so I am covering it with clear / red / gold cellophanes by Sebastian and also lots of deep conditioning, both which require the heat. The cord is not very long on this, but you can always get an extension cord.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find a decent heating cap like this in store for ages. This was awesome and a great price.</li>
    <li> The heat cap is awesome.  I have dry, fine hair and now my hair is super soft, silky and shiny.  I have been using Organiz Moroccan Argan Oil intense moisturizing treatment with the cap and the results are fantastic.  The extra effort and time involved in using this cap is well worth it.  I would highly recommend this item to anyone.</li>
    <li> My opinion in 2016: (2 stars).  So I&#x27;m back online to purchase this item again.  The heating concept is wonderful, it does wonders for my hair, as I have used it to condition with oil for the last 2 years before EVERY wash.  So for the last 6 months I&#x27;ve been meaning go to online and purchase another one because the problem I first had with the cap has only gotten worse.  It now only heats in the front, basically only heating half of my head.  &#x3D;/  The front half.  And it does that very well (all 3 heat settings definitely work).  Would be NICE to have my entire head heated evenly.  I&#x27;ve looked at just about all the other products on here, and pretty much have heard the same happens with all heating caps.  &#x3D;(  I am now seriously searching for a heating cap that will heat my entire head, I don&#x27;t want to sit under the dryer, all that hot air blowing on my face and drying my skin while I try to read or watch TV.  Not comfortable.   If it heated my entire head evenly, then I&#x27;d def give it 5 stars, as all other features on this item work very well.  Maybe I just got a defected one and it just continued to deteriorate..  I&#x27;m not saying don&#x27;t buy it, I&#x27;m just saying I hope yours works correctly if you get one.  I&#x27;m disappointed mine doesn&#x27;t.       My opinion in 2014: (4.5 stars)  Great item.  The heat isn&#x27;t distributed towards the nape of the neck very well,  but I still love it.  I do deep coconut oil treatments weekly.  My hair is super soft after treatments.</li>
    <li> Although I didn&#x27;t like this bonnet at first.  I decided to keep it.  It heats up very well.  However it is square in the back and most people have rounded heads,  so the fit is off and the back of the head does not get as warm unless you really tug at the band and force it to conform to the shape of the head.  I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a year for hot oil treatments; and deep conditions and just general scalp stimulations.  I tried several models and this was the only one that got hot and not luke warm.  It&#x27;s not very durable,  the plastic around the band that is attached to the bonnet has split. However, it is still working after a year so I guess I am getting my monies worth.</li>
    <li> This heating cap is absolutely wonderful.  My hair looks and feels so much better after a treatment.  I received this item fast, which was great!</li>
    <li> The cap does what it professes to do: heat the head/hair for greater assimilation of product into hair. It is cheaply made, however, in that, unlike, (for example), even a basic heating pad, it fails to give any indication of \\&quot;lo-hi\\&quot; for the heat setting. This, therefore, requires that you guess on how hot you may have it set at--(or cool), based merely on how it may feel once on your head. Also, make sure that your hair (if long) is piled somewhat tightly and securely  atop your head since it seems to be a typically China-made item regarding size, meaning, it is small. This will be relevant for all of you who are either male and/or for those of us who have a lot of hair to tuck up (under the cap). Last- but- not- least, don a towel about your neck during the process since it will leak or dribble product and moisture from your hair a little down the neck and jawline area..not a big deal, just something to contend with should you be be in bed, watching a movie as you process product into hair and/or not like that feeling of a wet neck, face- or- forehead, and back. Finally, do focus  when handling as, the plastic edges tend to be \\&quot;sharp\\&quot; and can therefore, give you a \\&quot;paper cut\\&quot; if not paying attention. All of that being said, the item does indeed bake hair product very well into hair..much better penetration than merely the old standard of sitting with conditioner in tub for 3 minutes (before rinsing),while you shave your legs. Thank you for this opportunity to review with you. Happy, healthy hair and enjoy your day!</li>
    <li> Heat is uneven and the cap size has no relationship to a head.  It&#x27;s just a sack and even with the adjustment strap tight enough for choking, it does not fit properly.  I had an old heat cap, not this brand, that was perfect for years.  This one is a disappointment so I do without a heat cap at tis time. Why didn&#x27;t I return it?  I kept using my old one until it died and at that time I had owned this one for about nine month.  :-(</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product. Works as expected. Could get a little hotter but it&#x27;s worth the price. Got if for my wife and she is happy with it.</li>
    <li> This Heat Cap is a great addition to my weekly deep conditioning treatments for my relaxed hair.  I love the snug fit and can really feel the heat working.  As a note, I apply the conditioner and then cover with a clear plastic cap.  I then place the Heat Cap on my head for approximately 20-30 minutes for great results.  As mentioned by other reviewers, you do feel the least amount of heat on the back of the head, but I don&#x27;t feel this lessened the benefit of using the Heat Cap.  It works well overall and my hair seems to love it!</li>
    <li> First off, it is what it is.....a thermal conditioning heat cap and I like it. It heats up quickly, I have big hair i.e my hair is natural and the cap fits my head and covers my hair completely. Also too, it is not some convoluted hair contraption that burns my ears off but it&#x27;s easy to use instead. I&#x27;m happy with the product and my purchase.</li>
    <li> great item works well and delivery is on  time.This is a product I will reconmend anyday,  for the stay home mom and layman [...]</li>
    <li> Now that i have this thermal cap,i can get professionally conditioned hair in  the comfort of my home with sacings of more than half the cost at a beauty salon.</li>
    <li> It heats my entire head, and works perfectly; just what I wanted. The quality of the product is above my expectations. I use it for my weekly moisturizing deep conditioning or protein treatment.</li>
    <li> this is the home heat treatment i&#x27;ve stayed with after a disastrous product fail with another brand.  this one fits great on my head with my hair piled high on top and can read and hang out with it on without my vision being impaired.  i havent had a problem with the heating element, especially when you consider that you dont want your hair too get to hot you just want warmth for the product to absorb without damaging heat.  i use the low setting and occasionally pump it up to high for a few minutes if i feel i need it but again not interested in getting it too hot and damage my hair.  i also have fine hair and need to treat it very gently.  I am average size woman and it fits fine.  if much larger size head or you have very bulky hair this may be too small for you but since you can return it, it is worth trying.</li>
    <li> This products is very sound and well made compared to others I have owned. I like a low temp that is really a low temp and this one is well regulated with the three settings.</li>
    <li> It is great to use with hair treatments.  The different heat settings works great.  The only bad thing is that the back part does not heat up, so you have to put your hair at the top.  Still works great!</li>
    <li> I agree somewhat with the previous reviews stating that the back of your head doesn&#x27;t get as well heated as everything else. However, if you put your hand back there when it&#x27;s at Hi setting, you&#x27;ll notice that it is actually heating in the back as well, it just FEELS like it&#x27;s not that hot because the heat coils aren&#x27;t as close to your scalp in the back (though it probably doesn&#x27;t achieve as high a maximum temperature in the back as on top). This may be an issue if you have long hair and want to make sure the heat distributes evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I disagree about any comments on highest heat achieved--this thing got pretty darn hot on Hi, and I had to back-down from the Hi setting to avoid burning my forehead!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it definitely did the job--my hair felt incredible afterwards, and that&#x27;s all that really matters!  I compared prices at Sally&#x27;s prior to purchasing and it ended up being about the same price, so I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this heat cap. It does what it is meant to do and is comfortable - although I haven&#x27;t used the chin strap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m living in Istanbul, Tukey.  I use this product with converter plug adapter.  5 minutes after plugging, its plastic surface burned and electricity cables appeared.  Luckily it wasn&#x27;t on my head.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this thing. The problem is the heating coils don&#x27;t cover the whole cap and the seam of the cap is a hard plastic that cuts into your neck.</li>
    <li> Awful doesn&#x27;t hardly heat, just in front waste of money!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this for my awful, fried, dead hair (haha). It works pretty well by heating up the cap so the deep conditioner can get into the strands of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had was as someone else mentioned, it really only heats at the top of the cap, so you would have to pull your hair to the top. I was under the impression that the whole cap would heat all around. Also, because the cap is some sort of plastic material, the edge (of the cap) does hurt my neck by stabbing into my skin. I have to adjust the cap a lot or wear a protection around my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cap does need to be plugged into an electrical outlet so you do have to sit down or stay around an area while it&#x27;s plugged in. It is pretty long, but I wouldn&#x27;t mind it to be just a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I bought this item &amp; if it does happen to die eventually, I probably will purchase another one. The only thing I wish was that the whole cap heated...I know there are wires inside of it...but you get what I&#x27;m saying.</li>
    <li> Faithfully ever week I condition or deep condition my hair with heat. This cap works like a charm. I love it!</li>
    <li> The heat cap is the best I have ever used and I saw improvement with the first use. But it.</li>
    <li> I got this to be my go to heat source for deep conditioning when I cannot bring my steamer. I was disappointed. It&#x27;s not as big as I hoped it would be. The heating is intermittent, I wish there was continuous heat. It works and will get the task done, but there has to be a better design out there.</li>
    <li> Great conditioning cap. Not only does my dry, frizzy hair come out smooth and almost shiny, but the act of conditioning (settling down with something to read and heat cap) is soothing &amp; relaxing.  My hair was so improved that I bought a non-electric cap with microwaveable pouches, so I could do chores simultaneously, but one of the pouches burst almost immediately in the microwave, ruining that whole rig.  Oh well, I love this cap.  When my daughter moved out a couple months ago, I bought her one too -</li>
    <li> I have had other thermal caps that were cheaper, so I was not happy paying so much for this one. However this cap has 3 heating options and holds all the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with it and recommend it.</li>
    <li> So I just put my cap on only to find, after 8+ years of work, that it had DIED!!!  I&#x27;m so sad, on here trying to find another.  I read all the great reviews for this one... then I decide to look and see what one I had... lo and behold!  I have a Mastex as well.  Mine has chuged along for over 15 years total.  That thing as put in work!!!  I&#x27;ll be ordering another today!  Oh and btw; my mother gave me this one (it had to already be 6-8 years old at the time) after she bought a new Gold N Hot, which never got hot and quit working after a few weeks.  She was so mad!!</li>
    <li> This item has worked wonders for my hair! It is an item that is not expensive and very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my conditioning cap. I use it every week.  The only downfall is that it doesn&#x27;t heat up in the back and it&#x27;s not cordless. But it&#x27;s still better than sitting under my hooded dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have bleached hair. I use good shampoo and my hair still needs that little extra help. When I received the cap I started using it right away. I wash, use AGADIR MOISTURE MASQUE!!!!! for my hair, throw on the cap for 20 minutes OR 1 ½ HOURS. I read or watch TV, RINSE AND STYLE. WOW I HAVE BEAUTIFUL, BOUNCY, SHINNING HEALTHY HAIR THAT HOLDS A CURL FOR MORE DAYS! My split ends are gone. The style lasts twice as long. I USE IT EVERY TIME  I WASH ME HAIR. Try it you&#x27;ll love your hair! I PROMISE THE MORE YOU USE IT THE MORE REPAIR.</li>
    <li> It runs small. If you have long hair, this is not the right cap for you.  It automatically shuts down when it reaches a certain temperature, wich is very good, but to condition my hair it needs like an hour or more to reach right temperatures trough my scalp due to the fact that this does not heat the top and middle back side of the cap. I read a review saying you can turn the cap so your entire head can receive heat, but being so tight in my head it would be a mess if i did this.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is very good tough... But cannot recommend it because you need an hour or more to reach your conditioner to your entire head. Sorry guys.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t hot at all &amp; wasting my money. 😒😒😒</li>
    <li> I use with my favorite conditioners and hot oil treatments. This cap makes your conditions more effective. I enjoy using mines you can also adjust the settings.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get hot at all. If you have very fine/thin hair then this is for you.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my old heat cap from the 90s and this one was exactly like it. It works great to help condition hair with products like Cholestral.</li>
    <li> I researched many conditioning heating caps before finally purchasing this one. So glad I did. It works wonderfully. Heats like a charm. Hot is hot but not burning hot. Enough to be safe &amp; heat your conditioner into your hair. Use it for 20 mins at a time. I found that&#x27;s plenty of time to condition hair. Tie the straps of the cap to get a complete heat all around. The cord could use an inch or two longer but no big deal. Love it anyway. Shipped &#x27; arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Works perfect,but I need a bigger size</li>
    <li> I love this thing, I know there are a lot of complaints about it not heating up the back but as another reviewer mentioned put the hair on the crown of your head and you won&#x27;t have that problem. This works well for me, so I don&#x27;t have any complaints, if it&#x27;s too hot just use a towel to cover your ears and the back of your neck.</li>
    <li> The entire back side including the nape doesn&#x27;t heat up which make this cap practically useless for me. It does have really long sideburns that heat up quite hot so you can really get deep conditioned sideburns if you&#x27;re Sly Stone or just burnt ears if you&#x27;re me.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t heat very well. It gets a little warm but that&#x27;s it. As others have said it doesn&#x27;t heat at the back at all. From the top of your head to the nape is cold.</li>
    <li> Bottom 4 inches of the cap does not heat well as other area of the cap almost little heat in that area. Right side of the cap heats too hot even on lower settings....must fold a paper towel and cover right ear.  The band holding the cap in place should be a band with an adjustable snap instead of using the style of band provided for ease of use.  Was concerned the cap size would be too small but does fit well. I will request a replacement as heat cap for hair treatment is too difficult to find.  Sold by Amazon for Pro Beauty.</li>
    <li> Order this steam cap for a friend it&#x27;s doing its job well so far she says</li>
    <li> a little too small for my daughter thick hair</li>
    <li> Love this heat cap! It is convenient, I dont have to take down my hooded dryer to steam/ deep conditioner my hair. It heats up well. However, not as much heat gets to the back of my head so I sometimes rotate the cap. Other than that , this cap is perfect!</li>
    <li> I love this cap.  I wash my hair and then put conditioner or a hair mask on after I towel dry it and then use this cap for 20 to 30 mins (with a disposal plastic cap on first) and I think it helps the conditioner/mask penetrate the hair.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and quick! Too bad it doesn&#x27;t come with more than one cap. They can tear easily. When you contact the manufacturer they don&#x27;t respond :(</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. However, it is not hot as expected.</li>
    <li> I like the Thermal Spa Conditioning Cap. I mainly like to use my hair steamer but when I am traveling, I take this as it is more portable. The cap does get very warm which is great but I would agree that some sections are hotter than others. For my purposes and for the cost, I was pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I am on my 3rd heat cap. I buy one once every 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;These really help condition hair, color hair and....treat the hair.</li>
    <li> THANK YOU FOR SAVING MY HAIR AND SCALP!!!! I used this to help the Leven Rose Jojoba Oil absorbs better and it does the job! LOVE LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I really love what it does for my hair. It let it so shinny and moisturized. Every Sunday I put on my hair treatment and I stay for 20 minutes under this cap, and you can see the difference</li>
    <li> I love this product! So convenient without the noise of a blow dryer. I can move around unlike being stationary under a bonnet dryer.</li>
    <li> Something I bought for my cousin who does hair. The one that she has had for probably over 20 years has finally went out on her. And she bought one from a beauty supply store that barely heated up. And she was telling me how she has been looking for the exact same one that she had before. So I want to want to Amazon and found the exact one that she had before that had went out on her. And she loves it so much that she doesn&#x27;t even use the one that she bought from the beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> One Star.... If the cap does not heat in all areas, then what is the point of only heating and treating the crown of your head and not the nape?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Low review for this reason the entire back of my scalp was not heated up.</li>
    <li> This cap is amazing it gets warm and then shuts off when it gets to hott, it&#x27;s really a great product. I am very happy with it</li>
    <li> this is a good product and arrived when promissed. I would advice my friends to get one. They heart of nice for a hot oil treatment.</li>
    <li> If I could give a negative star rating I would because this item is NOT worth the money.  The cap does *not* heat evenly and I should have read the reviews on this item instead of purchasing it!</li>
    <li> The cap doesn&#x27;t heat to the temperature I was expecting for the hair product I use. It is a ok product.  The temperature is not even in the cap, just in some areas the temperature raises.</li>
    <li> Not working buy how they handled my return I will buy from again</li>
    <li> Gift product, Mom says she loves it</li>
    <li> The heat cap works well, I have no complaint about the cap itself, my complaint is with the inner plastic cap they give you to use under the heat cap...it&#x27;s a joke, it a cheap plastic cap that you can get from any hair product place and it is thin and flimsy so don&#x27;t expect much use from it. As for as the heat cap, it does a good job and the heat settings are great. I have had a few heating caps in the past and none of them actually heat the lower part of the head and this one isn&#x27;t any different. I when I use it I simply hold the lower back of the cap down to my head for the heat to penetrate my lower back hair; it&#x27;s the same for each heat conditioning caps I have ever used. Outside the cheap flimsy inner plastic cap, I have no complaints and do recommend the cap.</li>
    <li> It was not the same brand they listed and did not work right out of the box.</li>
    <li> Ladies, if you want a deep conditioning this is the product to use. I use this product once a week to restore any damaged caused y the use of flat irons. After washing hair apply your conditioner, cover the hair with a plastic cap and then put the cap on top. I leave the cap on for 30  minutes and then rinse the conditioner from the hair and style as usual.</li>
    <li> it works ok, using it once a month would be better than the extra cost of getting a deep conditioning when getting my hair cut.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my heating cap!! It warms very well. The only thing I can say is that it doesn&#x27;t warm as much in the very back but that doesn&#x27;t matter cause my neck will burn anyway because it gets super hot at the top.</li>
    <li> I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED WITH THIS HEATING CAP.I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO CONDITIONING MY HAIR,EVERY WEEK,THANKS TO THIS CAP.  THANK YOU.</li>
    <li> Well It was great...until it decided to stop working. Not at all happy about the life span.  It&#x27;s back to looking for a replacement.</li>
    <li> I do agree with some reviewers, it does not cover the whole head. But as one reviewer said I turn it around to cover my whole head a little at a time. It heats well</li>
    <li> good  put work slowly</li>
    <li> The size is very comfortable and it gets  very warm BUT the back of the cap does not heat up.</li>
    <li> Love this cap.  It fits my little girls&#x27; heads perfectly and the heat settings are adequate for them as they hate a lot of heat on their heads.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t heat up for as long as I would like.  My mother has a similar one and the heat was very consistent.  I think I might try to get her to send that one to me.  I like this one, but the heat is intermittent so do be aware of that prior to purchasing.</li>
    <li> Works fine, but hurts the ears</li>
    <li> It was good for a while, then it started being bad. Meaning, it got really hot at first then cooled down after 3-5 minutes to the point where it felt like it wasn&#x27;t even on. I&#x27;ve only used it about 30 times before that started. Honestly, spend the money and buy http://www.amazon.com/Secura-S-192-Hair-Facial-Steamer/dp/B005M1M8YS/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1396662245&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;hair+steamer. Which is exactly what I&#x27;m about to do. (Don&#x27;t have a review on that yet since I haven&#x27;t purchased it yet, but it seems like a great product).</li>
    <li> I love this product. When I bought it I had a very damaged and weak hair.&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a week, after I wash my hair I apply any of my hair products and put the cap on. I leave it for about 20 mins and then wait until my hair is cold to rinse the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I really notice the difference in my hair now, this cap will help your hair to absorve the treatments better.</li>
    <li> Love this cap….works great!&lt;br /&gt;My homemade deep conditioner loves it too.</li>
    <li> smaller than I expected, very tight fit on my head</li>
    <li> I rated this four star,because i got the product in good condition. and the ability to steam my hair at my own convenient is absolutely wonderful! However the cap could get hot. Hence protective ear cover is required</li>
    <li> It works well for what I needed it to do. The price was reasonable and it was delivered on time. Ihave nothing negative to say.</li>
    <li> This is very good heat cap, it heats very fast. Would purchase from the same seller</li>
    <li> It fits well and I don&#x27;t have to use the chin strap.  It heats up very well.  I plug it in before I condition my hair so that&#x27;s it&#x27;s ready when I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> Works well for me.  My hair was very dry, and try to do a deep conditioner every week or every two weeks, this conditioning cap gets the job done</li>
    <li> I use this ALL the time!!! I give myself hot oil hair treatments at home on a weekly basis. I love this prouct and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> After my table top hair dryer clonked out, I knew I needed something and quick, as I deep condition my hair every two weeks.  I just used this heat cap tonight and must say that my hair has NEVER before felt as silky and soft as it has after using this thing. Typically, the table top dryer dries out the hair completely and it doesn&#x27;t feel like the conditioner really gets into the hair, but the cap really lets the hair take in the conditioner.  I was a bit wary after reading some of the reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. It does take some time for the cap to preheat, but once it was at the required effective temperature, I was very pleased. Previous reviews do mention the fact that the back of the head doesn&#x27;t really receive as much heat as it should and I would agree. But I also found that the entire head was soft, so there really was no issue. I am definitely glad I purchased this item and look forward to continued use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve own a heat cap for over 15 years and it still works great! It is such a vital tool to my hair regimen that it&#x27;s traveled with me. My hair responds so much better to deep conditioning and the heat helps me to cut the time I do it.  If it ever conks out, I will be getting another one quickly.</li>
    <li> The cap served the purpose of keeping the skull warm to help make the hair product more effective.  Unfortunately the lowest setting was too hot which is not only uncomfortable but overheating is apparently detrimental.   The only option left was to turn it off at intervals during the process.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic for anyone who does hair treatments often.  My aunt usualy does a hot oil treatment every couple of weeks.  She recently got one of these and says it&#x27;s increased the effects of the treatment and is much more relaxing while she&#x27;s waiting for the oil to work.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this cap at a great price.  The shipping was fast.  I can&#x27;t think of a better way to condition my hair at home.  Don&#x27;t go to sleep on this.</li>
    <li> I use this product every few days for deep conditioning. I love it because it is silent and I can still watch movies or television while my hair is deep conditioning. The only issue I have with the product is the portion of the cap at the nape of the neck does not get hot. I&#x27;ve remedied this by pulling all of my hair to the top of my head and then putting the cap on.</li>
    <li> I have used this product twice and have been very pleased with it.  It warms up quickly and provides enough coverage for my hair. Would definitely recommend it for an at home hair care treatment.</li>
    <li> This thermal cap heats fast and moisturizes throughout. Great for hot oil treatments.&lt;br /&gt;Adjustable heat setting just the way I like.</li>
    <li> it is good to use to condition your hair if your hair is very dry, and this little thing does give a lot of heat to conditioning it. love it!</li>
    <li> No reflection on the seller, they did a great job. This is the second one I have purchased and most reviews of this same cap everywhere are the same. It is not a defect, it is the way they make it, I dont know why, makes no sense. There is only one other brand available that is 3 x the size so this one is my best choice</li>
    <li> I read couple of reviews before purchasing this product. I agree that the back portion does not heat up much. All you have to do is when you tie up your put it on top of your head so that the back portion can heat up well. I find the product useful.</li>
    <li> Overall I am happy with this product, it does warm my hair and is good for deep conditioning treatments. Some of the drawbacks are the shortish cord.. it would be nice if it was longer.. and the way the heating is. It&#x27;s like there&#x27;s heat traveling from the back to the middle of your head, but not much around the sides or front.. Eventually all of my hair feels warm, but I feel it mostly in the back.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price but like someone else said the nape area from mid back of head down does not heat up. For me this isn&#x27;t much of an issue though I can see how it would be for many others. My nape area is pretty fine and loose textured compared to the rest of my curls so when I&#x27;m deep conditioning I don&#x27;t have to calm down a kinky kitchen. But I&#x27;m sure most other ppl will want to. It gets pretty darn hot in the front area though. Still soothing and you can get accustomed to the temperature pretty well it seems. My cap is a little hard to pull completely down because I have quite a bit of hair but once it&#x27;s on securely it&#x27;s okay. The locking mechanism on the chin strap (sort of like a cloth belt with the 2 metal rings and one cloth strand that you loop through and back through.... it&#x27;s really hard to get off in a hurry because the strap is stretchy so your inclination is to put it on snug but then when you try to remove it stretches more so it can be tricky to release. Nice that it came with one shower cap. I&#x27;ll continue to use this once a week, however. I would probably repurchase from a different brand to try out something else if something happens to this one. It works... just not over as much surface area as I&#x27;m sure most would prefer.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this product.  The first one I had for 6 years and I wore it out.  I will buy again.  The only con is that through continued use, the plastic starts to tear; however I brought another one because the product does provide adequate heat to deep condition my hair.</li>
    <li> excellent. Makes my hair soft and shiny</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cap!  This cap is for anyone with normal to damaged hair.  Great for deep conditioning, hot oil treatments or moisturizing. You maybe the laugh of the house but it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
    <li> this is the best cap i have ever used holds tight to the head so it keeps the heat in for your hair to get conditioned good i highly recommend this particular cap for your hair wheather its normal or dyed hair this cap will keep your hair in great condition</li>
    <li> This was the first time using my item after i bought it a few months ago and boy oh boy it started melting on my head and everywhere started to burn.  I was forced to remove it immediately so that i do not set myself on fire or get electrocuted.  I will be looking to see how to return this garbage back and look for a better quality steamer instead. Stay Away.</li>
    <li> Product shipped quickly and left my hair feeling silky smooth and flowing. This is exactly what I had hoped it would do.</li>
    <li> I have never posted a written review on Amazon but today I thought I should.  To start off, I have naturally thick 4c hair.  After putting color in my hair last week my ends become very tangled and I was unable to thoroughly comb through (even with conditioner).  So yesterday I decided to use the Thermal Spa Heat Cap for 30-45min with my conditioner and OMG it worked.  It actually worked.  I was soo shocked.  My hair became very detangled and manageable!  I was able to comb through.  This heating cap is a MUST-have for every natural...It definitely works with your conditioner to give nicely detangled, moisturized and soft hair!!</li>
    <li> i have used this cap with my conditioner and i love it.it as different settings for your hair.you can even relax while your air is being conditioned.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not so great. The back doesn&#x27;t warm up like the front does.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Its convenient to use while lounging.  The heat is great.  Gets very hot and allows hot conditioner to penetrate the scalp.</li>
    <li> This is the equivalent of going out in the sun with a cap on and some heavy conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I put on a heavy conditioner, pop this hat on for 15 minutes, and my hair is in much better condition after a few weekly treatments.</li>
    <li> I live in Europe so I had to buy a transformer to be able to use it. It is working perfectly! It enhances the uptake of nutrients from the oils I use, or conditioner. I have the heat cap on while I read or watch a movie, it is nice and warm, often I keep it on longer than one hour and after washing my hair, it is so shinny and a lot healthier. At the point where I put the conditioner in my hair, I sometimes even come out of the shower and use the cap another 10- 15 min. Now it is really nice! This step is a bit more work but for me who has thin hair it is worthwhile.</li>
    <li> It use this every time I deep condition.  I walk all over the house and plug it in, in whatever room I&#x27;m in.  It does the job.</li>
    <li> This cap just did&#x27;t work for me. It heated up ok, however I believe it would burn your ears if you wanted to do a treatment for 20-30 min because of the design of the cap. The big problem with this is the fit of the cap. When the cap is on and you are sitting up right (watching tv), the bottom of the cap rubs the back of your neck...Really Bad. I cound&#x27;t take it for the time of a treatment. It has a poor design. Good idea...Bad design. I returned it.</li>
    <li> I use this heat cap every 90-days when I do my deep condition or reconstructive treatment.  I love it because you can control the amount of heat you need to get just the right treatment need from whatever product you choose to use.  It&#x27;s even good to use for hot oil treatments or regular conditioner treatments.  Works great!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for people who want to do home deep conditioning treatments.  Not as a good as a hood dryer, but good enough.</li>
    <li> Steams my hair well. With one use I saw a difference, my hair is moisturized and much healthier. I certainly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the cap and it workes great with my conditioning pack!  I would recommend this to my friends and family!</li>
    <li> I got my product and I was happy that it came faster than the actual shipping estimate. I used it and I was ok with sitting with it on my head I could feel the heat. It heated up really fast which was another good thing, but i had a problem with it staying on my head. I have very thick hair so unless I straped it down it wouldnt fit my head. And when I did strap it down I felt like I was being choked so i am going to return for something else. But i think it is a good product just not for my thick hair.</li>
    <li> I am a college Student who lives in a dorm and my roomates complain about every noise I make. This is great to deep condition instead of getting the hooded dryer. I personally always hated hooded dryers but with this cap you can watch TV or videos while you are conditioning and I love that. This gets pretty hot.. I use it on the highest setting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars because the a back of the cap does not heat up like the rest of the cap. The hair just above ur neck will be the same temperature it was when you put on the cap. Because im ocd I would sometimes turn the cap around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this cap to anyone on a budget, who lives with people and who wants to watch Desperate Housewives while they condition.:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately mine got burnt and almost killed my cousin when i went home. We have 220V outlets back home ( the Caribbean) and I forgot to plug it into the 110V transformer. So i guess it was too much voltage for the cap. The wires inside the cap ate through the plastic of the cap and was about to eat through the plastic cap on her head and hit her WET Hair. I passed by her and touched the cap and it SHOCKED ME When she took it out it was revealed the cap was eaten up and and the inside wires burnt. So European Buyers beware ... OTHER WISE I love it and I would order one AGAIN :)</li>
    <li> cap is not big enough to fit the entire head it sticks up too high and it&#x27;s not wide enough for longer hair.  also it heats unevenly you  need to spin it around in order to heat the entire head</li>
    <li> Should&#x27;ve listened to other reviewers but I didn&#x27;t...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does NOT heat up in the back and it&#x27;s restraining because you have to plug it in and sit by the plug for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not a bad product but there are certainly much better ones out there for the money.</li>
    <li> I have always had dry hair and find that the conditioning cap is the solution. I only have to use it once every six weeks or so. It has been very helpfull</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a heating cap and decided on this one. So far, I&#x27;ve used it about three times and I&#x27;ve had it for about a month. I have a big head with some very thick hair and this cap is a tight fit. I never use the strap because it does seem very flimsy and with my big head I don&#x27;t need it anyway. It does get pretty warm, but not overly hot. You can wear it for a good while and not feel like your brain is being cooked. I would never put this on my hair directly. I always wear a plastic cap and even the directions say you need to do that. My only real complaint is the placement of the chord. It&#x27;s off to the side and I would prefer it in the back. I also wish the chord were a tad longer, but it&#x27;s decent size. I can sit on my couch near a socket and comfortably read or watch TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another review mentioned it doesn&#x27;t get hot in the back. I haven&#x27;t had that problem because I use a plastic cap and the heat spreads under the cap. There is no direct heat from the cap to the back of your head, which I am glad for because I think that would burn your neck. Yet, if you use a plastic cap then the heat will spread.</li>
    <li> I agree with the rest of the reviewers that the back of the cap doesn&#x27;t heat up. I don&#x27;t see it as much of a problem though because I pile my hair on top of my head and all my hair ends up getting heated anyway. Overall it leaves my hair feeling super soft and awesome! I also like that it came with a plastic cap to wear underneath the heating cap so I didn&#x27;t have to buy one. Good buy!</li>
    <li> My hair was damage with all the chemicals I used. I started using this heating cap with good conditioned products recommended by the beauty shop and it works perfectly. You have to be constant on the use of it. I will highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product was not what I expected. I think it is one size fits all, so if you have a big head this is not the product for you. I use this as a deep conditioning tool, but it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I would like it, so I sit under the dryer longer. Once this product dies away, I will buy a real dryer - the hooded (hard shell) kind.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Well made. I love it.  Can not live without this product. It made my Wen Intensive Hair treatment work even better.  Lots of room for very long hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Black American Natural 3b/3c I owned the exact brand previously (when I was relaxed) and it died after about 15 years. This one really works It gets really hot and helps especially if you have low porosity hair.  But relaxed or natural this heating cap works and helps w/ deep conditioning and pre-pooing.</li>
    <li> This product I can honestly say is used by everyone in my home at least once per week yes we all love it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Had to return this. On first use, the product heated up much too much in the back mid-section and around the ears and left the top and front of my head barely warm. There just isn&#x27;t even heat dispersion in this product for it to be effective. Also burned ear tips because it sits over your ears with no way to adjust ouch!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The return was easy. No problems there.</li>
    <li> Way too small to be useful! I bought this to keep my hair warm as the henna color penetrates, but I can&#x27;t get the cap far down enough on my head to keep the top of my head warm at all - which is where my visible roots need the henna the most. It&#x27;s more like an ear warmer. Even with the plastic cap, the heat does not spread at all. Waste of time and money. And yes, if it worked, the cord was too short - had to use an extension cord.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve own this cap for two years now and I use it once or twice a month when I apply deep conditioning treatments with heat.  I use a plastic liner/shower cap to keep it nice and clean and it works perfectly fine.  It is a little inconvenient to have to be sedentary for twenty minutes but I just fine something to do like sit in front of the TV or serf the internet to keep me entertained and before I know it, those twenty minutes are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do take care of it, every time I use it I wipe up clean with a damp cloth, even though I use a liner, I always wipe it clean just to make sure the conditioning product didn&#x27;t get on it.  I turn it inside out to air dry and then I fold it and I put it back into it&#x27;s box ready to use the next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and do recommend it for conditioning heat treatments at home.</li>
    <li> This conditioning cap is ok.  The only thing is that the back of the cap does not get hot at all.  Maybe is they can change the design, it would work a little better.  I am know in the process of looking for an alternative cap for my deep conditioning needs.</li>
    <li> I have searched every salon/beauty supply shop around for this item.  Excellent product and the price wasn&#x27;t bad.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a million</li>
    <li> wack cheap and didn&#x27;t work good</li>
    <li> If only using 1x30 days why not save $&amp;&amp; from salon treatments.  You can buy most salon brand moisturizing treatments without a License. Try Malibu products.</li>
    <li> Little big but works well. I&#x27;ve used it for a year know and still going strong!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product a couple months ago, and it worked as advertised for the first month or so. I used it about once a week after receiving it. Then the medium heat setting, which i used most often, started to fail- the cap will no longer heat unless it is set to the highest setting. I emailed the manufacturer, Mastex, about it twice, and they did not respond. their website contains no info whatsoever on their warranty policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out the only real way to reach the company (mastex/thermal spa) is by calling directly. Here is the information i gathered:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- the warranty period is one (1) year&lt;br /&gt;- process: you send them the malfunctioning product. YOU pay the shipping cost, which is not reimbursed. The product itself is not repairable, so if it is broken they send you a new one.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my straight long hair combine with sebastian cellophanes...as if I have my own salon at home...it makes my hair to look a lot healthier and shinier!!!</li>
    <li> I love this cap. I use it every week for my deep conditioning hair treatments. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It has just the perfect amount of heat and is very relaxing. My hair felt so soft after my deep conditioning and its nice to have finally committed to getting one of these. Even though the reviews are right, the back of this heat cap does not heat up as much as the rest, but with my shower cap under it, it gets all my hair warm and there is enough heat in the back to condition the back portion my hair. Great buy.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it does, just not warm enough for me, but I still use it often as possible</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the cap a few weeks and used it several times now -- and it does a very good job of conditioning.  I like the 3-heat settings option.  (Low wasn&#x27;t warm enough for long hair; switching between medium and high works well)&lt;br /&gt; I was a little hesitant to get it, after reading reviews that the back doesn&#x27;t heat up.  However, the back section of my cap DOES heat up  --  in the upper/crown only.  The lower/nape area does NOT heat up.  That didn&#x27;t really bother me, though, because I have very long hair and I \\&quot;pile it up\\&quot; on top of my head -- and the top of the cap gets plenty warm.  The ear areas do tend to get a little too hot for my liking, which I remedied by tucking a little white ankle sock under each side to cover my ears.  (I looked seriously dorky -- picture: floppy white beagle-ear-thingies hanging down from each side of my face:-)&lt;br /&gt;I gave it only four stars because of the overal size/shape of the cap:  it was a little snug on the sides (maybe I have a fat head ?) but it had lots of extra room at the top that went unused.  I tried \\&quot;snugging\\&quot; the cap down with the elastic chin strap, but I didn&#x27;t like the tightness under my chin.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a good deal.  i just hope it doesn&#x27;t conk out after a month, as happened to one reviewer.  (Will definitely report back if it does).</li>
    <li> I try and use this at least once a month.  It leaves my hair so soft and moisturized after the deep conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is now 2/13 and I am still loving my cap.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to use for deep conditioning my hair.  I wanted it as an alternative to sitting under my table top dryer.  It does serve it&#x27;s purpose, so I am happy about that.  My few complaints are that the cord could be a little longer.  I also have an issue with the two highest settings.  The highest setting seems to get too hot as I think someone else has mentioned; it sometimes burns my ears.  When it gets to hot I take it down to the next highest setting, but it feels like it&#x27;s barely warm.  I don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s such a big jump in temperature.  That is my main concern.  I&#x27;ll have to figure out some way to rememdy that. I do like the shape/fit of it. It fits around your head like a hood.  This is why I chose it over some of the other heating cap options.  If the temperature wasn&#x27;t such an issue I would have rated it much higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh I forgot to mention that it doesn&#x27;t heat in the back very well as others have mentioned.</li>
    <li> I use henna to color my hair because I don&#x27;t want to use any of the commercial chemical dyes.  Sitting under the hood dryer worked ok, but this is much better!  I used it for the first time last night and it worked great!  It heated fast and maintained the temperature throughout the 45 minute treatment.  I changed the temperature setting several times during the treatment to help set the hair.  My henna came out dark and covered all of my grey!  This is totally due to the even distribution of heat from this cap.  I highly recommend this heating cap for anyone who uses henna or any other type of hair treatment.</li>
    <li> This cap heats up to proper amount for deep conditioning and I find that although it would be nice if the heating element extended to the back it still works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only warning: watch out for your ears.  I couldn&#x27;t find a way to position the cap so it wasn&#x27;t burning my ears.  Now I wear a bandana folded over my ears to keep them from getting so quickly burned!</li>
    <li> seemed like a good buy. Didn&#x27;t work so I ended up sending it back. If it had worked I&#x27;m sure it would have been a decent product to have.</li>
    <li> I received the heat cap this week and used it for the first time.  I have very short hair (sort of a pixie cut) and my hair is thin.  I have a relaxer and I color.  My hair has a tendency to be overly dry in spite of taking care of it.  I purchased it to use with a deep conditioner I purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cap heats extremely well on the low setting (maybe because my hair is thin).  I&#x27;ve decided to cut my treatment time from 20 min to 10 min so I don&#x27;t overdo it.  It fits comfortably enough for the amount of time it has to be on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the reviews I read before purchasing almost convinced me not to buy it because they said it didn&#x27;t heat well enough.  Since this is designed for conditioning and not for drying, in my opinion, the heating level is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to evaluate its performance over a long period of time.</li>
    <li> I would agree with many of the other reviews ... The heat cap gets really hot in the front part... Totally burns my ears... And the back barely gets heated ... So uneven heating is a problem with this product. Also the wire has rough edges and totally hurts the back of my neck when I am wearing it. Average product on the whole; and I haven&#x27;t seen the results yet .</li>
    <li> Because the cap has wires in it and is made of coarse plastic, the cap is rather stiff. So, when you wear it, the back of it does not form to the shape of your head and leaves a gap between the cap and your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The back of your head will get kind of warm, but not nearly as warm as the top of your head. This can be a problem if you are trying to get even distribution for color or henna processing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chip strap does nothing except make you feel like a martian.</li>
    <li> I have to wear it backwards to get the back of my head well. However, it works well and gets warm.</li>
    <li> I wished it got hotter but it works fine.</li>
    <li> This cap totally satisfied my hair conditioning needs.</li>
    <li> This is a great thermal heat cap!  I used it for the first time a few days ago and love the results of my hair.</li>
    <li> Thank you so very much.  Now this makes it so much easier to do at home treatment.  Again, thank you so mcuh</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was traveling and couldn&#x27;t bring my at home steamer. I plugged this &amp;#34;Heat Cap&amp;#34; in and it barely got warm!! The back of my head was totally omitted because there was NO heat coming from the base of the cap. This was a total waste of money. I bought the cordless Thermal Turban (microwaveable) and this works much better!!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this product but could not fit my head. And my head is of normal size too but with the oiled hair or not, the cap is made too small. Maybe it will work for a child but not for an adult. Goes in the garbage.</li>
    <li> It does its job, the back towards the nap of the neck doesnt get as warm and the rest of the cap but if you pull your hair up a bit and pull the cap back to right where the hairline starts it helps. Its portable and Ive been taking it overseas during 2 deployments (im in the army)andneeded something compact. I gave it 4 stars because it reliable and inexpensive. I have a more expensive heating cap that I use for deep conditioning at home as well but when Im on the go I use this.</li>
    <li> I have used a similar style heat cap and wanted to get one of my own. During the first use with this product it stopped heating and it never heated again. The heat cap malfunctioned the first time I tried to use it! This was not a good investment of money.</li>
    <li> This is a cap that I wanted and was having a hard time trying to find on at the beauty supply stores (over priced) but  I can always depend on Amazon to help me find quality products at a reasonable price.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I have very long hair and always use deep conditioning products to keep it looking healthy and shiny.  When I was younger, I would use my mother&#x27;s conditioning heat cap.  I was pleasantly surprised to find one exactly like hers and I just love it.  At times, you do have to adjust the heating levels to keep the hat at a comfortable temperature but it works beautifully.  Also, the order was delivered timely which I do appreciate.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The highest setting is lukewarm at best, and the back of the cap, near the nape of the neck, does not heat up at all.  Pretty useless.</li>
    <li> The heating cap works well with the conditioning caps....don&#x27;t by one without the other.</li>
    <li> loved this , Very useful in winter time to relax myself with hot oil message . My husband is also using when he need the hot oil message with some warm sensation.</li>
    <li> The strap broke when I tried to put it on it gets a little bit hot but not really...the only thing I like is it is quiet... I would not recommend though and too lazy to return...</li>
    <li> Works very well with my 4C hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I am a natural African American woman. Moisture is a necessity in dealing with my hair. This conditioning cap adds to my deep conditioning process and my hair has benefitted from adding heat to this process. I do not know what I would do without this conditioning cap.</li>
    <li> Product is good. Gets the job done. Previous comments that said it doesn&#x27;t heat up much in the back are correct, so I just make most of my hair fall to the front  and it&#x27;s all good. I have locks and it fits my hair so it&#x27;s a pretty big cap! No regrets!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it on myself and both girls, 10 year old and 12 year old daughters. They sat down watched TV while it sat on their head with a deep conditioner and no issues. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 due to the back not getting hot. I expected that based on the reviews. My old heating cap would heat all over, too bad I cannot find that one its over 20 years old and I got it from my grandmother. I could not locate that particular brand anymore. Overall it’s a good product…..</li>
    <li> I use this twice a month for my deep conditioning and hot oil treatments. It is definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> I use this all the time when deep conditioning my natural hair, but the little strap to tie under you neck is annoying.  Its one of those loopy throughs with the two metal rings.  I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t just add velcro straps for the security straps.</li>
    <li> I have tried these cap for many times. I never experienced any discomfort or burn using the medium power. Yet the effect on moisturizing me hair needs time to prove.</li>
    <li> This cap does what it says it does, and heats up fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is cut with plenty of space in the top to accommodate a bun - I have quite a lot of hair, and there&#x27;s more than enough room for it piled up at the top of my head without spreading it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there are no heating elements at the back of the head, so if you are using this cap with henna you will want an additional heating pad for the back of your head to assure uniform color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have not measured with a thermometer, but it seems like the heat cools down over time if you leave it on the same setting for longer than 30 mins or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s excellent for my uses, and I&#x27;m glad I have it.</li>
    <li> Luv it and the price. This unit gets super hot and I have to admit I have had absolutely no problems.</li>
    <li> I brought this product a couple of days back. And after reading all the reviews I was so excited to use this on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It worked wonders on my really long black hair. My hair feel so so smooth just after one use with my deep conditioner. On clean wet hairs I applied my deep conditioner made a bun on the top of my head (Since my hair are really really long they cant fit inside the cap with back bun. So I had to do top bun.)N After 30 mins on medium setting my hair feel so smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say it is an amazing product. I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_</li>
    <li> waste&amp;#60;waste don&#x27;t waste your money stop heating in the back after a few uses!!!!</li>
    <li> got this to use on my daughter hair and it worked like a charm. doesn&#x27;t get to hot like our bonnet dryer and it&#x27;s makes no sound so she can watch TV or play a game.</li>
    <li> The heat is a gentle heat but very effective.  The cap fits comfortable. You can comfortably wear glasses and read with the cap on. I love that it just says warm and no heavy wet towel that keeps getting cold.  I have had mine for years and I use it a couple times a month.  If I have done something to destroy my hair then a few times a week.  I couldn&#x27;t live without this heat cap! It helps give outstanding conditioning to your hair.  I also suggest coconut oil to condition your hair.  [[ASIN:B003B3OOPA Nature&#x27;s Way Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 16 Ounce]] It is also THE best skin tightener and conditioner.</li>
