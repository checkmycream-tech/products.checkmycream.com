      <li>It is the best by far out of all the brands.</li>
      <li>This is by far the BEST product and lasts way longer than anything he has bought before.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best hair product I have ever used, and I used a lot of them.</li>
      <li>I have tried many gels and this is the best by far.  </li>
      <li>Washes out easy with warm water and shampoo.</li>
      <li>Nothing works better than Spiker.</li>
      <li>but it is way better.</li>
      <li>Plan to buy more when I run out.</li>
      <li>I have been using &amp;#34;Spiker&amp;#34; as my hair product of choice for many years now (Can&#x27;t remember how many?)</li>
      <li>Most gel will collapse or melt in the rain we get in WA.</li>
      <li>My husband has tried SO many products, he had the Elvis style &amp;#34;pompadour&amp;#34; hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Advise: Try it out, one of the better holding gels I had.</li>
      <li>This is the best product out there if you want short spikey hair.  </li>
      <li>It was ok.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years, and love it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One trick to make it work better</li>
      <li>love this gel from the 1990</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear it spiked up, so can&#x27;t speak to whether it holds that, but for normal day to day styling it works great.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall good product though, great for getting stubborn pieces to do what you want them to, without looking wet or greasy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very strong, clean, and light.</li>
      <li>The hold is super strong and it holds all day!</li>
      <li>easy to style your hair&lt;</li>
      <li>Easily comes off</li>
      <li>Love it great for short hair people</li>
      <li>this is hands down the best stuff.</li>
      <li>The product itself works great but the lid on the container did not close properly.  </li>
      <li>I love that there isn&#x27;t very much of a scent to it, because I don&#x27;t like products with lots of perfume.</li>
      <li>Finally a hair product that works on my strong \\&quot;mind of its own hair\\&quot; luv that it&#x27;s water resistant</li>
      <li>This is the first hair gel that doesn&#x27;t smell so strongly.</li>
      <li>for my hair (pretty fine and not a lot of body on its own).&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>this is by far my favorite.  </li>
      <li>High quality, Easy,  </li>
      <li>I wondered why they had it taped down so good when it arrived.  </li>
      <li>well at first</li>
      <li>I have used MANY different gels, sprays, etc.</li>
      <li>After 40 years of trying many gels, finally, a gel that works.</li>
      <li>Joico Spiker is great for those with really thick hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s water resistant, just as described - and sometimes even leaves enough after a surf session that I can re-style it again without adding more.</li>
      <li>... since my hair is so short, many mornings I could just go with it again if I needed to do so.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a matter of time until some marketing hot head decides to change the formula</li>
      <li>They like to have it spiked up off their face, or put into a faux-hawk and after trying many different kinds of gels and hair glues</li>
      <li>My only fear is that good things don&#x27;t last forever.</li>
      <li>If you put a small amount on (maybe an inch of it) when your hair has just a tiny bit of moisture left in it from the shower, it spreads nice and evenly and gives a good look, especially for very fine hair like mine that would otherwise be all fuzzed out.  </li>
      <li>It is priced ok and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>It works very well..</li>
      <li>go on trips for months at a time, and one tube of this lasts me the whole trip.</li>
      <li>I thought it was really package</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t quite use as much of this as Pauly D.  </li>
      <li>check out the larger size available as a pump type dispenser.</li>
      <li>It holds up in the weather and keeps my hair straight up.</li>
      <li>This is also nice since I have been cutting my own hair for about 5 years now.</li>
      <li>My package also came with an extra smaller container of gel which was a nice surprise.</li>
      <li>When you want a strong hold for messy hair look or clean cut professional...</li>
      <li>A little bit of the product is all you need; it&#x27;s excellent for my extremely thick hair.</li>
      <li>I live in Kansas, and the wind can really screw my hair up.</li>
      <li>It does get very brittle, so make sure you oil your hair or add water to it first if you don&#x27;t want the hold that hard.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff for my little boys hair.  </li>
      <li>Pretty simple.</li>
      <li>Just a tiny bit of it gets my hair exactly how I like it.  </li>
      <li>We have tried a lot of hair gels for my son&#x27;s very straight and flat hair.  </li>

<ol>
    <li> best hair product out there</li>
    <li> love this gel from the 1990</li>
    <li> gets the job done, great quality!</li>
    <li> Only thing missing on this is the color. I thought it was blueish</li>
    <li> Simply Amazing! Product holds the hair in place all day. Best styling on the market. A must have for styling hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Less expensive from Amazon than in styling salon.</li>
    <li> Joico Spiker is great for those with really thick hair.  It holds incredibly and does not flake.  We have used it for years!</li>
    <li> Love it great for short hair people</li>
    <li> Love this stuff for my little boys hair.  The only stuff that seems to actually stay working for more than a few hours. Actually my husband used it beacuse he ran out..and now HE ordered some for himself! Winner winner chicken dinner.</li>
    <li> We have tried a lot of hair gels for my son&#x27;s very straight and flat hair.  This product allows him to have some texture and also withstands his hockey helmet!  Great!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is by far the strongest gel on the market to hold your hair stiff in one position all day. If you slick your hair back or spike it this gives a clean strong hold that last the entire day regardless of the weather condition. Washes out easy with warm water and shampoo. My package also came with an extra smaller container of gel which was a nice surprise.</li>
    <li> This stuff works very well, holds my hair in place all day long.  Plan to buy more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great Hold&lt;br /&gt;Quick Drying&lt;br /&gt;You can put it in with wet hair&lt;br /&gt;No flakes&lt;br /&gt;No Shine, but still looks wet-ish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advise: Try it out, one of the better holding gels I had.</li>
    <li> This is the best product out there if you want short spikey hair.  It lives up to its name.  All hair types can be spikey with spiker.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this product for a long time because it is the only one that actually works amazingly for short hair styles.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have 4c hair which is tight and coily, and the regular hair gels I&#x27;ve used and spent so much on hasn&#x27;t worked in the past but this does! It is a white glue like product but dries clear and doesn&#x27;t leave the white flakes. It does get very brittle, so make sure you oil your hair or add water to it first if you don&#x27;t want the hold that hard. It also holds my hair when I&#x27;m sweating 🙌🏾</li>
    <li> After 40 years of trying many gels, finally, a gel that works. It&#x27;s very strong, clean, and light. My only fear is that good things don&#x27;t last forever. It&#x27;s a matter of time until some marketing hot head decides to change the formula</li>
    <li> I have been using this spiker glue for years. It is the best by far out of all the brands.</li>
    <li> Just as described and arrived early.</li>
    <li> Spiker is an excellent product with a strong hold that lasts throughout the day. Does not flake or leave residue. A little bit of product goes along way. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Nothing works better than Spiker. Holds your hair however you want. Washes out and does not cause any flakes. A must have.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair product I have ever used, and I used a lot of them. Joico rules!</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick hair, and this is the only product that&#x27;s ever been able to keep my hair spiky.  Been using it for about 7 years now after exhausting every other option.  It&#x27;s water resistant, just as described - and sometimes even leaves enough after a surf session that I can re-style it again without adding more.</li>
    <li> A little bit of the product is all you need; it&#x27;s excellent for my extremely thick hair.</li>
    <li> Great gel.  Just a dab needed.  Shop around though as prices vary quite a bit from store to store.  Also watch the price per ounce as containers vary.</li>
    <li> My friend introduced it to me &amp; I moved to Georgia and could not find it so I ordered it on here. Addicted to this hair glue. Use it all the time</li>
    <li> I have very short pixie-style hair.  I&#x27;ve become a hair product junky and this is one of my favorites.  I don&#x27;t wear it spiked up, so can&#x27;t speak to whether it holds that, but for normal day to day styling it works great.  I use this for days where I&#x27;ll be outside at a soccer game or something like that and need my hair to not go crazy because this product has great hold.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is texture.  It is almost too sticky.  Once I&#x27;ve put it on my hair, I have to wash my hands immediately because there is so much gunk left on my hands.  And I use a very small amount to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall good product though, great for getting stubborn pieces to do what you want them to, without looking wet or greasy.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t quite use as much of this as Pauly D.  Just a tiny bit of it gets my hair exactly how I like it.  Matte finish, lots of hold, good texture so some of my fine hairs stick together and my hair doesn&#x27;t look fuzzy.  I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for 15 years or so, and I haven&#x27;t even grown a third eye or anything! hahaha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One trick to make it work better (at least on my hair) is to wait until your hair is almost dry, but not quite.  If you put it on when its wet, you get a shinier, Pauly D type look that I&#x27;m not going for.  If you put a small amount on (maybe an inch of it) when your hair has just a tiny bit of moisture left in it from the shower, it spreads nice and evenly and gives a good look, especially for very fine hair like mine that would otherwise be all fuzzed out.  If you wait until your hair is completely dry, then it doesn&#x27;t spread as well and you tend to get a clumpier look and have less control over the styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I go on trips for months at a time, and one tube of this lasts me the whole trip. Maybe 3 months total.</li>
    <li> It was ok. Not as good as Chi Man</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product for my boys&#x27; hair.  They like to have it spiked up off their face, or put into a faux-hawk and after trying many different kinds of gels and hair glues this is by far my favorite.  It holds their style all day long and it only takes a small dot on each boy.  Smells really good, too!</li>
    <li> I got this product to keep a handle bar mustache.&lt;br /&gt;It works beautifully!&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt; Very strong hold&lt;br /&gt; will last all day&lt;br /&gt; Easily comes off&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;no con, its thee best!</li>
    <li> works good for me.  try it and see if is good for you.  everyone has their own preferences and so just gotta try it out</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!  I have used MANY different gels, sprays, etc. for my hair (pretty fine and not a lot of body on its own).&lt;br /&gt;This product is one of the greatest I have found.&lt;br /&gt;I holds ALL day and honestly... since my hair is so short, many mornings I could just go with it again if I needed to do so.&lt;br /&gt;It looks like glue - great name for it.&lt;br /&gt;It is great in that it doesn&#x27;t require much for a great hold and it allows you to sculpt your hair, spike, flatten, you name it!!!  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product I plan to use for a long time to come!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Also check out the larger size available as a pump type dispenser.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Finally a hair product that works on my strong \\&quot;mind of its own hair\\&quot; luv that it&#x27;s water resistant</li>
    <li> My son has reached the age where he takes pride in the way he looks. When it comes to his hair and the style he&#x27;s chosen for it, there is no other product that works.</li>
    <li> smell like Elmers Glue!&lt;br /&gt;but its good! easy to style your hair&lt;br /&gt;It will dry your scalp out! try your best to avoid putting it to your scalp</li>
    <li> My husband has tried SO many products, he had the Elvis style &amp;#34;pompadour&amp;#34; hair. He is Sicilian and his hair is thick but not coarse.  This is by far the BEST product and lasts way longer than anything he has bought before.</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for years - couldn&#x27;t go out the door without using it on my hair.</li>
    <li> Extremely strong and kinda hard to use. It did arrive open with some of it all over the bag in came in</li>
    <li> I used this product for 3 years. High quality, Easy,  Best on the market.</li>
    <li> This stuff spikes, holds, doesn&#x27;t flake and smells awesome. You can&#x27;t go wrong.  I use this on my five year old&#x27;s hair and now my husband uses it too.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this product for years and loves it. It only takes a tiny bit so it lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> My wife says it works the best for her.  Only place she can find it....</li>
    <li> The product itself works great but the lid on the container did not close properly.  I have to keep a piece medical tape on it to keep it closed properly to ensure it does not dry out.  I wondered why they had it taped down so good when it arrived.  I thought it was really package well at first then I saw why.  Again the product is great!  My son likes it a lot.  Just the lid on the container not good.</li>
    <li> The styling gel works good.  I would buy again when this bottle runs out.  I would recommend this to any one that needs good styling gel.</li>
    <li> works just like it said it would</li>
    <li> Great product as always! Been using for years.</li>
    <li> I have short, thick hair that is difficult to spike. Most gel will collapse or melt in the rain we get in WA. Not Spiker! It holds up in the weather and keeps my hair straight up.</li>
    <li> My son uses this and he has a mohawk. It is the best product for this that we have found.</li>
    <li> I have tried many gels and this is the best by far.  I have short, grey, spikey hair.  I wanted something that would keep the look tussled...this one definately does.  It is priced ok and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years, and love it. One bottle lasts a long time, and once the hair is styled, you don&#x27;t have to worry about it losing its hold.</li>
    <li> Pretty simple. I have been using &amp;#34;Spiker&amp;#34; as my hair product of choice for many years now (Can&#x27;t remember how many?) and this is the cheapest place that I have found it sold at. This also saves me the time it takes to drive to a hair stylist. This is also nice since I have been cutting my own hair for about 5 years now. When you want a strong hold for messy hair look or clean cut professional... this is hands down the best stuff.</li>
    <li> This gel is amazing and of great quality. It also has a very pleasant fragrance thats not overpowering but just right. Works great</li>
    <li> I love that there isn&#x27;t very much of a scent to it, because I don&#x27;t like products with lots of perfume. This is the first hair gel that doesn&#x27;t smell so strongly. The hold is super strong and it holds all day!</li>
    <li> You can only get this online, or in salon stores. A little more expensive than its counterpart \\&quot;got2b glued\\&quot; Spiking Glue ($4-5 at WalMart), but it is way better. It works very well.. I live in Kansas, and the wind can really screw my hair up. I have the un-affectionately named \\&quot;Bieber\\&quot; haircut, and to keep that style all day (wind or not), here is what you do:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a 1/2 inch dot in your palm, rub palms together until the product is warm. Pat your hands together until you see it start to string fibers. Then after making fibers, pat your head all over, alternating making fibers and patting your head. This will let the product get into your layers and give you awesome control and volume. You can then rub your fingers in your hair and style! You can check my profile pic to see what I&#x27;m sporting. Wind and water resistant, that kicks butt.</li>
