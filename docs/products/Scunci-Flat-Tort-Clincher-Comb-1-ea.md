### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Not so happy as to how they charge $9 for the clip and have it say $3.45 for the tag on the product when it gets here!</li>
      <li>After growing my hair out and trying a cheaper version that never would hold, I was happy that this stays together and doesn&#x27;t pop off.</li>
      <li>She said it was really good, so</li>
      <li>It is a good product to have for a hair accesorry.</li>
      <li>Love this clip!</li>
      <li>I love love love banana clips and this one is one of the best.</li>
      <li>Keeps hair in place, and very easy to use.</li>
      <li>and I gifted her this one.  </li>
      <li>ITs attractive and very functional.</li>
      <li>I would like it better if it lasted even longer....</li>
      <li>Great for creating fro-hawks with natural hair</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s Ok, but plastic looks cheap</li>
      <li>It is easy to get in and out of one&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>This is such a great thing for anyone with longer hair.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t stay in place, and I have relatively full hair</li>
      <li>This clip is pretty sturdy, stays quite well in my hair and looks great in my very dark blonde/light brown hair.</li>
      <li>Thanks for quick service.</li>
      <li>They work well and the little tabs at the top make it easy to fasten the clip.</li>
      <li>This clip was very flimsy.</li>
      <li>FAST shipping</li>
      <li>I may see if I can do something with them before it heads straight to recycling.</li>
      <li>Too bad - I have to say this looked really awesome in my hair</li>
      <li>My hair is pretty thick and needs a heavier duty clip than most people.</li>
      <li>My only thing is it might not be good for very very thick hair, but also I have purchased these kinds of clips at Claires and those ones are actually a little better than these ones in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t be fixed; I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any way glue would hold it.</li>
      <li>I wanted to replace my old out dated banana clips.</li>
      <li>- the tortoise shell coloring gave it a grownup, classy look.</li>
      <li>Be careful pulling your hair back and up with it, the teeth/combs are pretty</li>
      <li>but my heavy hair always wins in the end.</li>
      <li>this hair clip will slip down from where u first secure it to your hair - maybe my hair is too thin - I don&#x27;t know if there would be a difference w/thick hair.</li>
      <li>Also the price seems a little much bc</li>

    <li> This clip is pretty sturdy, stays quite well in my hair and looks great in my very dark blonde/light brown hair.</li>
    <li> Great for creating fro-hawks with natural hair</li>
    <li> Love this clip! My hair is pretty thick and needs a heavier duty clip than most people. ITs attractive and very functional. FAST shipping</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it on Amazon but I got this in a grocery store maybe 2 or so years so. I wore it only once in awhile, I dunno, maybe 10 or 12 times total and today it just snapped apart. Can&#x27;t be fixed; I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any way glue would hold it. So now I&#x27;ve got these two halves. I may see if I can do something with them before it heads straight to recycling. Too bad - I have to say this looked really awesome in my hair - the tortoise shell coloring gave it a grownup, classy look.</li>
    <li> This is such a great thing for anyone with longer hair.  It is easy to get in and out of one&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> holds the hair very well, can be put on really tight or loose. can also be used to put hair up or down</li>
    <li> The picture makes it looks bigger than what it is.  Wife was not happy with it so it got returned...</li>
    <li> This one really works...if you have thick hair.  Does not pop open.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t actually use it but I broke my girlfriends and I gifted her this one.  She said it was really good, so I&#x27;ll take her word.</li>
    <li> I love love love banana clips and this one is one of the best. My only thing is it might not be good for very very thick hair, but also I have purchased these kinds of clips at Claires and those ones are actually a little better than these ones in my opinion. Also the price seems a little much bc I buy mine at CVS for a little under $4</li>
    <li> Much smaller than I expected but does the job. Be careful pulling your hair back and up with it, the teeth/combs are pretty sharp.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it holds my hair up for a while where other clips seem to slide out after an hour or so...</li>
    <li> This clip was very flimsy. I wore it twice and after the second wear, one of the hooks broke as I was opening it. There wasn&#x27;t a lot of pressure on it and I was careful as I removed it. I will be trying to return.</li>
    <li> They work well and the little tabs at the top make it easy to fasten the clip. The tabs also make it easier to gather the hair into the clip.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands, and this one holds up the longest before the hinge breaks.  It&#x27;s a flattering look for long, thick, curly hair.  I would like it better if it lasted even longer.... but my heavy hair always wins in the end.</li>
    <li> The screw that holds both pieces together came off as soon as i opened the clip to try it on. Bad quality!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Ok, but plastic looks cheap</li>
    <li> this hair clip will slip down from where u first secure it to your hair - maybe my hair is too thin - I don&#x27;t know if there would be a difference w/thick hair.</li>
    <li> I get these for my daughter all the time. It works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I wanted to replace my old out dated banana clips. After growing my hair out and trying a cheaper version that never would hold, I was happy that this stays together and doesn&#x27;t pop off.</li>
    <li> Keeps hair in place, and very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Had no problems with this clip and ordering was a breeze. It is a good product to have for a hair accesorry.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay in place, and I have relatively full hair</li>
    <li> Not so happy as to how they charge $9 for the clip and have it say $3.45 for the tag on the product when it gets here! Providing a picture...</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. Thanks for quick service.</li>
