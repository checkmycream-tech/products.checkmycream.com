<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Used merkur and feather blade. This cuts greats and doesn&#x27;t slice my face up like the first two.</li>
    <li> The blades are too dull or not sharp enough.</li>
    <li> Great blade for money &amp; seem to hold their sharpness longer.</li>
    <li> A good price for the product.</li>
    <li> These really disappointed me... I read that they were a great, smoother alternative to Feather blades, but I got a lot more cuts than with any other blade I&#x27;ve tried - weepers too, not just nicks. They are sharp but also seem to be rather hard, unforgiving blades. If you have perfect skin with very few bumps or blemishes, they might be for you.</li>
    <li> A waste of money. Feather blades give a closer shave with no irritation.</li>
    <li> Great price on authentic blades, work just as I remember from 45 years ago.</li>
    <li> Very good blades, better than the 200 Derby blades that recently purchased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a double edge newbie and so far I&#x27;ve tried 3 different brands of blades... the Astra Superior Platinums are my favorite, followed closely by the Wilkinson Sword Classics. The Persona Israeli Crystal Super Plus Platinums tug on my whiskers and give me razor burn and I don&#x27;t like them at all.</li>
    <li> I think the wording is deceiving, saying 5 cartriges instead of saying 5 blades gives a buyer the incorrect impression.  I would not have bought that product if I had known I was  getting only 5 blades for that price.</li>
    <li> exellent Good product</li>
    <li> These blades are my favorite so far. They are moderately aggressive in my Merkur 34C. My baseline were the Personna Reds, which I found to give a less-close shave than these. I can get 4-6 shaves out of every one which, at the price point, is very good. At four shaves per blade, I&#x27;m paying less than $0.07 per shave on blades. I am very happy with that.</li>
    <li> Great shave for my husband.  He has purchased more.</li>
    <li> Ive been using these types of blade and my old style &amp;#34;open Top&amp;#34; shaver for years now, and these are probably some of the lower quality blades Ive purchased. They get the job done, but I have picked up random brand ones from walmart that were sharper than these. I wouldnt buy them again, especially if you&#x27;re like myself and have course facial hair.</li>
    <li> A good blade for a quick shave and those new to the world of wet shaving; sharp without being too hash, forgiving without being too dull. Depending on your beard and technique, it might take a few extra passes to achieve baby smooth skin.</li>
    <li> I remember fifty years ago when my dad would wait in line at the pharmacy when the then-new Wilkinson Sword blades were in stock.  They were the sharpest and longest lasting blades ever.  Still true!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re just stating to shave with a safety razor use these until you get used to it. Then switch to feather blades.</li>
    <li> Really like these.  The sharpness is just about right for me.</li>
    <li> Good blades work nice clean shave sharp keeps good blade for a clean shave not a lot of irritation at all.</li>
    <li> In my top 3 of DE razors, behind Astra and Feather</li>
    <li> I use these for my aquarium scraper.  They effectively remove the algae from the glass.</li>
    <li> Lower quality blade. You may get a week out of a blade but they cost so little, you can afford to change the blade often. I used them in the Weishi.</li>
    <li> Smoothest shave ever. Feels like I&#x27;m rubbing the back of a spoon on my cheek</li>
    <li> Terrible blades, I mean terrible. Do not waste your time and money. This is not even close to a close shave. For the last  two months I have been trying different blades like Polsilver, Feather, Personna, Astra and Merkur. This one was the worst by far.</li>
    <li> Great blades for the wet shaver. I have a coarse beard and this blade does a nice job of beard removal. You need to make several passes but after you are done, you have a great shave.</li>
    <li> I heard good things about these blades but I have to say they are not that great at all. I took it out of my razor and tossed the whole package after the first couple of strokes. It may just be that it doesn&#x27;t fit my razor right (Merkur 23c), but the blade sticks out way too far from the head and doesn&#x27;t give a smooth save at all.</li>
    <li> Using this in my Merkur 37c SLANT BAR.  I already had a 100-pack of Astra SP, but I am still new-ish to DE safety razors, so I&#x27;m still inquisitive enough to try a few blades. So far Astra SP is the best. Wilkinson was a close second and I don&#x27;t regret trying it, but I won&#x27;t buy again. The value isn&#x27;t there. It was still a bit rougher than Astra. Others I&#x27;ve tried so far are Van Der Hagen (Germany), which came with my Van Der Hagen razor and Merkur (by Solingen), which came with my Merkur 37c Slant. Van Der Hagen blades are tolerable, Merkur blade was forgettable. I have relegated all of these to &amp;#34;clearing the runways&amp;#34; - trimming the sideburns, for which I use the regular DE (not as easy with slant). I have also recently tried Feather and the first shave was rather nice, but the second was rough - I suspect they are a &amp;#34;one shave blade&amp;#34;, which makes them too expensive and not worth it.  I will probably give them as samples to friends and maybe try it once or twice more in each of my razors and will update if I have any news.</li>
    <li> Not as sharp as Feather.</li>
    <li> These are nice blades for the price, I used them with a reasonably cheap razor (WEISHI 9306FL Long Handle) and the pair of them do an excellent job getting the hair off of my face. I have used 2 of the razors shaving 3-4 times a week for the last 3 months and have had no issues. I changed the first one after about 6 weeks and just changed out the second razor. I have pretty fine hair so this may not be the case for everyone else but these get the job done.</li>
    <li> How an aggressive razor blade can give such a cruddy shave I don&#x27;t know.  This is the only blade I have ever had a big nick from.</li>
    <li> Great German-made quality.  This is a very fine-edged razor and dose a fantastic job in my Merkur razor. I get at least 2 weeks out of each blade though I do have a less-than-heavy beard. As long as they continue to manufacture in Germany, I will continue buying.</li>
    <li> What much can you say about razor blades - they work.</li>
    <li> I have coarse, relatively flat beard hairs and fairly sensitive skin. These are the blades I have found best for my hair and skin. More aggressive blades (like Feather) seem to cut slightly smoother on the first or second use, but don&#x27;t last for more shaves than the Wilkinson Sword classics, so don&#x27;t warrant the higher price in my opinion. Less aggressive blades like Derby don&#x27;t last as long for me, and irritate the skin more due to cutting slightly less smoothly.</li>
    <li> Tore me up ,the blade is not a sharp blade at all.I would not recommend these. I will stick with feather or shark.</li>
    <li> As with all razor blades, they perform differently for different people. These do OK for me, but Feather blades do better. Other people might get different results, therefore my advise: Get a 10 pack of multiple brands and try them out and stick with what works for you</li>
    <li> Sharp, Shaves me good, could get more uses out of it, but my facial hair is very thick and coarse! Overall very pleased!</li>
    <li> These razors are very sharp.  They also seem durable. Just be careful when you pick them up to&lt;br /&gt;insert them into your razor as the sides are quite sharp as well.  Overall a great value.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;tried-and-true&amp;#34; trusted brand of blades that my dad used to use, and which I started shaving with when I was younger.....Good standard quality and they fit most single-blade razor holders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And these single blades shave just as smoothly as the triples do: They hold their sharpness well after several shavings (My beard is more on the &amp;#34;rough scraggly side&amp;#34; so I have stiffer beard hairs and often wear-out the sharpness of the other triple blade razors after only 2 or 3 uses, but each of these Wilkinson&#x27;s Blades stay sharp over 5 or 8 uses or more.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with the price, which, after years of buying triple-blade razor and forking over large sums of cash for sets of only 5 or 8 blades, I was able to buy 30 blades at only a fraction of the cost of the triple blades....When I purchased these, it was $1.87 for a set of 5 blades (that&#x27;s just 37 cents a blade; compare that to the exorbitant cost of a single triple-blade model in the store, which are around $2 or $3 EACH)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades like these aren&#x27;t often found in the stores these days, so I was happy to find these online and at such an affordable price....Definitely will repeat and buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> These just feel fancy</li>
    <li> Getting good smooth shaves with this blade. Very sharp and lasts a long time. I was previously using Derby blades which are very poor and dull compared to these ones. I will definitely buy this blade again.</li>
    <li> This is not a review for the wilkinson blades themselves, which are awesome (5 stars). I selected to purchase 100 blades for $18.95. The title above said 50ct. If I had received 50 I would have been ok with it (cost a bit higher than local, but saved me a trip to the store); however, I received 10 blades for $14.54. They sell locally for around $1.25 for a 5 pack. Two dollars fifty is no where near $14.54 and since it isn&#x27;t what I signed up for, Kay Beauty: I will absolutely be returning these.</li>
    <li> I guess these blades are sharp enough for novice shavers and deemed safer. But anyone who has graduated Shaving 101 and knows his way around a double-edge razor, probably won&#x27;t be satisfied.  Sure, you can get a clean shave with these, if you drag your razor repeatedly over the same area. But with a sharper blade (the Feather Hi-Stainless Platinum is my choice), it becomes a one-pass operation. Just take your time and use proper shaving technique. For me, the Feathers are definitely worth their slightly higher cost.</li>
    <li> These are very good blades and give a good shave, but do not seem to last as long as the bldes in the 100 pack.</li>
    <li> Love getting back to the Wilkinson Blades. They are much sharper then others and last longer too. I will keep using them as long as i am shaving.</li>
    <li> Nicked my skin a couple times. But once you get the the hang of it, you&#x27;ll be slick as a whistle.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve tried a number of different blades...previous to this batch I&#x27;ve use merkur and dorca...I liked the merkur they were great, but they were expensive. The dorca were cheap (and came with the new handle), but you only got 1 maybe 2 good shaves before needing to change the blade....I&#x27;ve shaved 3 times with the same blade and still as sharp as the first time and the shave is still as smooth and close.</li>
    <li> Work pretty well, get about 3 shaves per blade.</li>
    <li> There are better razors out there, even at lower costs but may not be as readily available as these. I would consider these to be solid middle level razors with decent shaving action (but nothing superb). If you have thick hair, this may not be good enough. If you prefer to pay more for better quality, then something like Feather and KAI, both from Japan are great, and if you prefer to pay less and still go higher up in quality you can try something like Astra, which is from Russia. These Wilkinsons are from Germany and come packed in a convenient plastic case per five blades and each blade individually wrapped in paper.</li>
    <li> These blades have provided the closest, smoothest shave to date.  I&#x27;m relatively new to wet shaving and DE safety razors, so the only thing prevent them from five stars is that I did notice a little burn on my neck the last time I shaved.  This might be completely a function of technique, and if I find that to be the case I will definitely edit this review.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my safety razor.  Excellent alternative to over-priced disposables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Recently bought another batch of these to restock. They were absolutely terrible. Maybe one good shave out of each blade. Just ordered another brand to try.</li>
    <li> Today was my first ever wet shave.  I used a Merkur 23C, a Wilkinson Sword blade, an Omega boar brush and Proraso soap (bowl lathered). Previously I was using Shick Quattro Titaniums. For my first wet shave I did 2 passes and I got a better shave than 3 with the Quattro. No nicks, cuts, or burn. I also have a Merkur Blade and some Personna&#x27;s to try. I gave this four stars because it worked well for me; however I am not certain it is worth five stars until I try some other blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone new to wet shaving I would recommend trying this one (along with others).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Since this post I have tried Crystal and Feathers. Feathers are hands down the best. I will never use another blade.</li>
    <li> My dad (who was born in 1933) told me a story that when they first starting importing these into the US a long time ago him and his dad would go to the corner store to buy these, because they were only allowed to purchase 1 pack of 5 every week because they were in such high demand!  Still a great razor.  Gives me the most pain free and cleanest chave yet!</li>
    <li> Started shaving with the $4 Chinese Special DE razor. Recently upgraded to and Edwin Jagger and grabbed a pack of these blades; they pair well with that more aggressive razor. Very happy with these, comprable performance (for me) to Sharks.</li>
    <li> Smooth shave like new several days! An old brand every bit as good as I remember. Thank you for prompt shipment.</li>
    <li> I really want to lvoe thse blades badly but it just doesn&#x27;t get over the hump for me.  They&#x27;re sharp yes - but dont&#x27; seem to do the job as well as it should given its sharpness.  Its&#x27; not so sharp that you feel you&#x27;re in danger, yet its not quite getting the whiskers off you (to be fair.. i have ridiculously thick/coarse hair so only Personnas so far.. EXTREMELY SHARP.. have come close to providing me a totally cose shave - but it still hasn&#x27;t).  Trying feathers next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is decently sharp, decently comfy, and decently long-lasting...  I really want to love these blades!  But.. it just doesn&#x27;t do anything (for me) to any satisfaction in any area.  it may work better and be the sweet spot for people with softer whiskers</li>
    <li> These are great blades for me. I have tried 4 different brands of blades. These give me the closest shave. I will be purchasing more of these when I use up up the Persona blades that I just bought.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only recently begun using different safety razors and find different blades work better in different razors and differently with different users.  I&#x27;m trying this with several of my razors with success.</li>
    <li> I decided to go back to double edge razor , brush and soap. These are the same blades I used when I first started shaving back in the early 60&#x27;s. Great shave, much better than an electric razor.</li>
    <li> I got these because my son wanted to try them.  He said the shave was close enough so give it a four.  Just need to find a longer handled razor for him as he hated that part.</li>
    <li> We live in a small town &amp; I couldn&#x27;t find them any more. It&#x27;s nice to find some place, we can get the things we need.</li>
    <li> I have used these blades in years gone by and my memory was correct. These are a very sharp blade that provides me with a nice clean shave. The one blade I use so far lasted for seven shaves and then I started to notice just a bit of pull. They are also more readily available than some other brands. I&#x27;d definitely recommend them as a high quality blade.</li>
    <li> Out of 5 different brands I have tried, these gave a smooth, clean cut.</li>
    <li> The blades have been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;W.L.Murray</li>
    <li> Very nice blades! I have tried many that are out there, and have settled on these for they provide me with a BBS shave without any nicks, cuts and burns. They very easily give me 3-4 close and comfortable shaves. YMMV.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many DE blades, some costing less and some more.  For my face, beard and wallet, these Wilkinsons are the best.  Smooth close shaves for 3-4 days.  That&#x27;s the best I get from any blade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found these work best for me personally. A friend let me use a pack of his more expensive blades but choosing the right kind in this kind of thing is highly dependent on a number of factors. I just know these suit me, don&#x27;t cut my face up, shave close and quick.</li>
    <li> Great affordable blades. Never going back to disposable razors.</li>
    <li> I bought these from the local national drugstore chain. Over paid, but a good quality shave. These were my first blades as a wet shaver, I have since bought a 125 Sampler pack [[ASIN:B002Z6YXIW 125 BEST Blade Sampler FEATHER SHARK ASTRA BLUEBIRD NACET BIC LORD 7 O&#x27;Clock]]. These were not part of it, but are one of favorite blades after trying several others and improving my wet shaving skills. These last the longest before need replacement. Despite its longer lasting edge it does not quite top my favorites. Trig [[ASIN:B009CCFW14 TRIG Silver Edge Stainless Double Edge Razor Blades (100)]], Vudyut Super-Max Platinum, and Gillette 7&#x27;oClocks [[ASIN:B005A96JBK 15 7 O&#x27;clock Double Edge Safety Razor Blades SUPER PLATINUM]]so far have topped my list in that order.</li>
    <li> Best ratio of price to quality (at about $1.30). You can get cheaper blades, but you shouldn&#x27;t. These hold up well and get the job done.</li>
    <li> These are excellent blades but I deducted one start for their price.  The derby blades work just as well and are priced $10/100 and $15/200 but these are $18/100 and are not any better.</li>
    <li> The first WILKINSON SWORD double edge razor blade gave me 15 shaves; other double edge razor blades are good for only 2 shaves. Your warehouse workers carefully packaged everything; all products arrived in good condition.</li>
    <li> These give very consistent, close shaves for me without nicks.  Very dependable!</li>
    <li> Just average for me.  I think Feather and Gillette Silver Blue gave me a closer shave with one more use out of a blade.</li>
    <li> these German blades work great and, their always readily available.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been very satisfied with every Wilkinson product I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
    <li> I received these blades promptly and the quality of the shave is good comparing the cost of triple blades and I think this is worth the money.  these blades are VERY SHARP and will nick your face if you get in a hurry when you shave so be careful when using.&lt;br /&gt;These blades are a money saver.</li>
    <li> these blades give a nice clean and smooth shave, but I wanted something just slightly sharper, so I went with Gillette seven o clock yellow. Good blades though.</li>
    <li> sharp and performs well. I still like my feathers more. I liked these more than the personna blue.</li>
    <li> Amazing works perfect for me! These are &amp;#34;As sharp as a Sword&amp;#34; however these may not be right for you try a sampler pack it is easier and cheaper than buying the single 5 packs.</li>
    <li> I switched to wet shaving and tried sampler packs of derby, dorco, merkur, astra, shark, feather, wilkinson, and lord blades.  I wont buy products from Russia or Israel (not for religious reasons, see USS Liberty) so that narrowed the field some.  The feather blades were absolutely the sharpest but I shave after having coffee and the slightest jitter would result in a nick. The wilkinson blades were probably the second sharpest and most importantly they are available in my local stores.  Wilkinson is owned by Schick and I have heard the Wilkinson name is being phased out, so I will try the Schick blades next.  For me, when considering performance, cost and availability, the Wilkinson blade was the best.</li>
    <li> Tugged like crazy, wish they had been better, but I am feather spoiled.</li>
    <li> I bought these to go with a custom made safety razor I had made for my boyfriend. They seem to work for him, though I don&#x27;t think he uses the safety razor every day (he has a matching mach three style for that).</li>
    <li> I use double edge singel razor cartridges in my hair timmer gizmo, and they are perfect for my purpose. Would buy them again.</li>
    <li> These blades are really sharp yet don&#x27;t irritate as much and are really smooth to shave with. I read this is due to the coating either way it must be convincing since I noticed its smoothness before learning about the special coating.</li>
    <li> The Wilkinson Sword is a very sharp blade in my opinion. If I have plenty of time I like using them. If I need to go quicker I use Astra SP&#x27;s. There is something nostalgic about using them for me. I remember seeing them in my dads shaving kit when I was a kid. I like having them in my kit too.</li>
    <li> I purchased the five-pack that can only be added on to another order. These were my first safety razor blades and were recommended to me as a step down from Feathers which I was warned might be too aggressive for a beginner. These blades got the job done, even with two day&#x27;s growth. There were minimal nicks. I did have to run over my beard a second time when I went two days without shaving, but this was expected.</li>
    <li> try this blade before you give up all the chrome ie de safety razor :)&lt;br /&gt;I tried with merkur and feather blade and almost gave up on de but then I tried wilkinson and what a difference. this blade is even better than Mach 3.! I ordered 100 after trying sample pack.! just 20c a piece now. and it lasts about same as mach3 razor costing much much more.!&lt;br /&gt;and what&#x27;s matter with chrome? well we all know ready made razor is mostly plastic. and I hate plastics. de razors are mostly chrome and I love shiny chromes</li>
    <li> Great DE blade.  Smooth shave.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> The only reason this doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because they&#x27;re just not as good as the old original Wilkinsons.  I expect the reason that they don&#x27;t make them that way any more is because if the blades don&#x27;t last as long, they can sell more.  Fair enough.  I still get great shaves with these.  Use a hot washcloth on the face, then hot lather.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use for my first time with a safety razor. I don&#x27;t have anything to compare them to, but they cut the hair off my face so that&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> These are worth the price I couldnt believe the amount of days I continued to get close excellent shaves. I will be purchasing more of these in the future.</li>
    <li> I love this blade, blades are sharp and will easily provide a close non pulling nick free shave for at least a week before the need to change out the blade. I have some blades that are sharper but find that they are too aggressive in every razor I own except the 1950&#x27;s gillette model. The Wilkinson blades provide the same shave in all of my DE razors. Used to buy these locally at a reasonable price but they have been pushed out in favor of the expensive multi blade replaceable heads. It would be a sad day for me if I found this blade was discontinued so I have been stocking up while they are available at a really reasonable (cheap) price.</li>
    <li> I bought these because of the price. They aren&#x27;t as sharp as others; nor do they hold their edge as long. If you have really sensitive skin, choose something else. If you&#x27;re not really picky, give them a shot.</li>
    <li> My husband like them very much</li>
    <li> My husband got the multi pack blades to see which one he likes the best, and he said this is the best blade that he has used. He can get 3 comfortable shaves out of it.</li>
    <li> I used to be able to get these in NYC at any 99 cent store, then at walmart, but as of late, I coudn&#x27;t find them anywhere else, but amazon.  Not worth ordering alone, but worth it as an add on with free shipping.  I bought myself a few, so they should last me for a while.</li>
    <li> These blades cut my facial hair reasonably well (very little stubble left after three passes), but I experienced unusual and surprising levels of redness and tenderness on my neck that I haven&#x27;t experienced with other blades (specifically, the best blade I&#x27;ve enjoyed so far was the Gillette Silver Blue, but I didn&#x27;t get this with Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock SharpEdge (Yellows) either).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve discontinued use because of this, but perhaps they may work better for others.</li>
    <li> alright blade, first kind I purchased. After shaving for 6 months I know I prefer the feather style of blades for my skin type.</li>
    <li> Started using Wilkinson when I was in the military.  It&#x27;s been awhile.  Still looking for my double-edged razor though. I know it&#x27;s in a box somewhere.</li>
    <li> These are stamped &amp;#34;Made in Germany&amp;#34; and are just awesome. Just switched to DE Edwin Jagger De89 after more than 30 years wasting money on disposables.. My first shave was with these blades: awesome experience. Not a single cut and as close of a shave as it gets. The only question is HOW IN EARTH were we convinced that disposables are better than regular DE razors…(my father that is, since he started me on disposables..)..</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve switched from a Mach 3 to the double edge safety razor, I&#x27;m never going back.  What can I say?  The razor blades are dirt cheap, last a descent 3-4 shaves before I replace them (not because they dull, but they are so afforable that I can shave with razor sharp blades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend getting a shaving brush and shaving soap.....as I noticed that made a marketable difference versus using Gillette shaving gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this brand of razor.</li>
    <li> Perfectly sharp and good for 3-4 days of shaving. I like that the blades are easy to remove from the paper wrapper and the plastic case has a built in &amp;#34;disposal slot&amp;#34; for used blades. My only complaint is that they&#x27;re too expensive. You can get compatible blades for half the price.</li>
    <li> I use a couple of different DE razors chasing behind a wet electric panasonic.  These blades are just right- Aggressive enough to clean shave, but smooth enough to not send me to the ER.  Not made in Russia or China, to boot.  Haven&#x27;t drawn blood with a Wilkinson since I was 16.  My beard has gotten a lot thicker and tougher since then, too.  No more Gillettes made in the USA.</li>
    <li> It is Ok blade. It will give me decent shave.&lt;br /&gt;Not impressed though. Persona or Astra works much for me better.</li>
    <li> these we ordered to go with the razor we ordered and they were a great price and we will purchase more</li>
    <li> The price is great for the blades but they could have been sharper. The blades from Feather are better in quality, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I got this on amazon when I  could not find it anywhere in store. they come in wholesale pakaging , so individually wrapped in white paper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is great but the quality is aweful . my blades were not very sharp... The ones you get in store last atleast 2 -3 shavings before i throw them away but these were blunt from the start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are also not numbered ( usually you have the razor blades numbered 1, 2,3,4 so you can remember when you turned them over)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate this but I hate disposable razors more so Im using them. very disappointed</li>
    <li> These blades seem to be pretty consistent in quality, unlike the Astra blades I bought not long ago. I have a thick, course beard and it still takes several strokes to get a close shave. Razor burn on my neck is a problem with these blades as it has been with all the blades I have tried, except the Feathers. Feathers are great, but they don&#x27;t last past a couple shaves before I have to change them. These give me a few more shaves before I have to change and are cheaper than Feathers, plus I got them in one day after placing my order. That is not going to happen with Feathers. For the money, I don&#x27;t think you can do better than these blades.</li>
    <li> The blades are fine. Razor is a little cumbersome although very competitively priced when compared to the Excel cartridges. This way I have extras.</li>
    <li> Would have liked it to be a bit sharper. Have to make too many passes to get a clean shave.</li>
    <li> I find this blade works very well in combination with the Merkur Futur. I shave my head and face three times a week. I get the best BBS with this razor. The blades seem to last three to four shaves for me. One of the closet shave that you can honestly feel the difference. I highly recommend these blades for any DE safety razor.  But then again what works for me may not work for you.  Try them out and see what you think, you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price of under two dollars. It&#x27;s not going to break the bank if it doesn&#x27;t work for you.</li>
    <li> What more can you want. I used these years ago when they didn&#x27;t have disposable razors. Now that I am tired of throwing away money, I have gone back to the &amp;#34;old fashion&amp;#34; way of shaving. Wilkinson is the best.</li>
    <li> Good, but feather is best.</li>
    <li> Great product - great price</li>
    <li> There is always a trade-off between sharpness and comfort, and unfortunately these blades didn&#x27;t work well for me in either category.  Even right after a shower and with good shaving cream, I found going against the grain to be quite uncomfortable.  I really needed to pull the razor through the hairs, which is never good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has different preferences when it comes to safety razors, but these really do not hold their edge too long, and they aren&#x27;t that sharp to begin with.  Sword blades are definitely a notch above Murkers, but I would suggest getting either Kai or Feather blades.  Those will allow you to cut will very little effort, thus reducing irritation.</li>
    <li> I have found better blades for a lower price.</li>
    <li> Get as close as a shave with these as I do any other (well, maybe not the Feathers) ... will get more soon :)</li>
    <li> A solid blade choice.  A little sharper than the Derby&#x27;s I have.  Can&#x27;t wait to get some more use out of them.</li>
    <li> This is only the 2nd blade I have tried.  I could feel the Derby blades which came with my razor pulling and cutting each hair on my face.  They still gave me a close shave, but the Wilkerson blades cut my beard much more smoothly, and comfortably.  I am still in my learning curve after going back to a safety razor, but I love the way your face feels compared to using disposable razors.  I will try out a few more blades.  I never realized how different the blades could feel.</li>
    <li> I got these because I knew the brand from way back when. I had no idea about choosing blades when I bought them. Now I would recommend these if you have tried them before and liked them, otherwise get a sampler and work your way through as many blades as you can find. There&#x27;s no &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; blade for everyone, just the best blade for you in a particular razor.</li>
    <li> I got sticker shock at the price of new multi-blade razors.  Thought I&#x27;d go back to my old Gillette razor and needed blades.  Wilkinson sword was my choice in the 60&#x27;s and they still work well today.</li>
    <li> Get  three shaves per edge. Six shaves per blade.  Great savings over throw away razors.</li>
    <li> The blades are a little too sharp and cause too many cuts while shaving, not so smooth as a Feathers, Bic or Mercur</li>
    <li> Extremely sharp, cuts smoothly; tested it on a plastic string tag from new clothes and it literally cut the string in half without any force, simply touched the string and it cut in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the hand it feels a bit more durable than the Feathers, but I haven&#x27;t had a problem with either. The blade cuts smoothly, but like the Feathers I have to make a few go arounds because I have coarse, curly beard hair.</li>
    <li> Gets dull after 4th shave. Good raiser blade at the beginning.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price</li>
    <li> great price. quality blades</li>
    <li> I have bought a variety of razors to see which suits my beard the best which is thicker than most. This one ranks about the same as a merkur in terms of sharpness. Was not a comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Excellent close shave! Best quality of any blade that i&#x27;ve tried. I have found these blades to be the very best blade on the market.</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive skin and thought these would be kinder to my skin. I was wrong. They are kinda doll.</li>
    <li> The blades can cut you if you are not careful when using a new blade. After a few uses it dulls enough to get careless and still shaves good. Stays sharp for about 10 uses for me.</li>
    <li> .There&#x27;s just something about these that don&#x27;t work for me.  I get better results and less irritation with Derby.  YMMV</li>
    <li> Not as sharp as many other blades. I&#x27;ve used their disposable razors for years and figured I&#x27;d give these a try when I decided to switch to wet shaving. The blade pulls and leaves my face a little raw.</li>
    <li> Love em and they stay sharp if rinsed in cold water.....</li>
    <li> Not sure why companies that make the DE blades can&#x27;t make the blades slightly more durable so you get a better shave. I&#x27;ve shaved a few times with this Wilkinson de blade. Would I buy them again, absolutely not. However you get what you pay for at least with these de blades. Cheap blades, very, VERY thin, not sturdy and not very durable.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> work well..not the sharpest</li>
    <li> I have used  Wilkinson for may years when I chose to wet shave . There is nothing more to say. The product does what it is suppose to do.</li>
    <li> I got a perfect shave with these blades. Much better than the more expensive popular brand. I almost gave up on shaving with a double edge razor. I tried quite a few of the most popular brands, and the best of them needed to be honed better. These are sharpened to a shaving edge at the factory. I will not be buying another brand of razor. Wilkinson knows how to do it right. All razor company&#x27;s claim that they are the best. Wilkinson might be. The quality is there. For the price they are worth trying.</li>
    <li> Pretty good shave for me.  Based on my skin type, light skin, thick hair sensitive skin, I like these, the Bic and most the Astra Superior (green). Gillette and Merkur also worked well.  Sample pack is a great way to go to figure this out.</li>
    <li> These blades use a proprietary coating made of both teflon and ceramic (most other blades only use teflon). This coating not only helps the blade last longer but also makes the blade super slippery and easy to drag across your face even if you don&#x27;t have the impeccable technique necessary for sharper blades like Feathers. The reason the coating helps the blade last longer is that when DE blades wear out it is not as much because of the metal wearing out as it is the coating wearing off. The only disadvantage to how slippery these blades are is that you won&#x27;t feel it when you are pressing too hard and you can easily cut yourself without realizing it. Remember your technique: no pressure, let the razor do the work, and these blades will reward you with unparalleled comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of sharpness these blades are in the medium to high range. They are sharper than Sharks but less sharp than Feathers. I would actually strongly recommend these to beginners over any other beginner DE blade such as Shark, Astra, or Derby because of the incredible smoothness when using these.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving with a double edge razor.  I&#x27;ve tried Merkur blades and these are better for my face (your experience might be different).  I&#x27;ve ordered a sampler pack that includes both BIC and Feather blades - heard good things about both.  I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;ll have to try many out before finding what work best for me.  I have medium beard with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> tHESE ARE SHARP!  aND A BARGIAN!  wHY PAY 22 BUCKS FOR THE NEW STYLE WHEN THESE</li>
    <li> Really nice razor blades from a really nice seller. Im sticking with these from now on.</li>
    <li> I picked these up as I am new to DE wet shaving and didn&#x27;t want to jump right into Feather Blades. These blades gave me a good shave with my Merkur 34c but not a great shave. The price was right so no complaints.</li>
    <li> My favorite blade so far. Very sharp, very smooth.</li>
    <li> these are great blades, new to this type of shaving and was looking for a really good $ razor sharp blade.</li>
    <li> sorry folks - what are you comparing these to? they stink. flat out stink. inconsistent, don&#x27;t stay sharp as long as other blades and they do a lousy job on my very heavy beard. I&#x27;m 60, i&#x27;ve been shaving with a blade since i was 12. these blades are only good if you have nothing to compare them to or you&#x27;re shaving a very light beard or leg hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have used Feather blades for years, they are fantastic and WAY sharper than these. Don&#x27;t say they &#x27;cost more&#x27; - they last longer and stay sharper. no comparison. I have recently purchased some Shark blades which get rave reviews elsewhere. we&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> After trying a sample pack of about 10 different popular brands these are my favorite.  Nice balance between sharpness and gentleness on the skin.</li>
    <li> Congratulations, you are using a TRUE razor... and these are the FINEST blades made for it!</li>
    <li> I have experimented with several types of blades.  Wilkinson blades give me a smooth shave first time and last a long time.  They are a good value.</li>
    <li> The vintage, British version of the Wilkinson Sword shaving blade is a modern classic, and is still sold online at inflated prices. The Wilkinson Sword Classic is made in America; while it&#x27;s a solid blade, and one of the better domestic blades, it doesn&#x27;t last more than two or three shaves. For better performance, you&#x27;d do better to try an number of Russian blades (at a better price).</li>
    <li> My favorite glad this far. Sharp and smooth. Have a coarse beard and have used red personna, derby, shark, Astra and blue bird</li>
    <li> Same great quality as decades before! These blades are SHARP! Keeps a good edge and is a great substitute for the disposables. I prefer the safety razor and these blades to the high-end razors.</li>
    <li> Buy these instead of s***ty multiblade razor cartridges. Great quality, lasts long.</li>
    <li> These are good blades.</li>
    <li> almost impossible to find in stores anymore. My Dad always used the Wilkinson sword blades so it was the one&#x27;s his sons all learned on. Happy to stock my medicine cabinet with blades once again.</li>
    <li> Less than feather blades, but still very sharp. They are much more forgiving than feather blades. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever but  cut with these blades. They are now my preferred blade.</li>
    <li> My 19 years old love it,really a surprise with so many razors on shape blades and colors,my son when back 50 years and he love it, together with Butterfly Open Double Edge Safety Razor.</li>
    <li> Arrived in good conditions and on time. Have not used them yet because I&#x27;m saving them, in case the power goes out and have need of an emergency razor.</li>
    <li> I had been using Derby Extras for months, but didn&#x27;t like them very much. These Wilkinson blades give me a ridiculously smooth shave, NO (let me repeat NO) tug and pull or razor burn, and their company logo has swords on it. If you&#x27;re on the fence about getting these, climb over it and buy.</li>
    <li> Received without delay. I&#x27;m looking forward to a great shaving experience</li>
    <li> It gets the job done but it is not the sharpest blade I have used.  The more dull the blade the more pressure you apply and the more swipes on the face, which causes more irritation and chances for cuts.  I have used a total of three blades so far and this was in the middle.  If you have fine or thin facial hair, then this might be ok, but not recommended for thicker beards.</li>
    <li> Works great for my beard and face.</li>
    <li> Cool name but not that good of a blade in my opinion</li>
    <li> I switch between these and the Feather brand occasionally just to switch things up.  Either way, I follow up with my Fusion, ATG, to get my face BBS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My grandfather also loves them, so I gave him some for his birthday in August and then again for Xmas.</li>
    <li> The product details says five cartridges so I figured I would receive five cartridges (twenty five blades) from this company. I got one cartridge (five blades). But this company will get to keep it&#x27;s $3.41 because I have to pay the return postage which I won&#x27;t do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After I wrote the above review I got an e-mail saying someone had made a mistake. The e-mail asked if I wanted them to send me the other four cartridges (the ones that they were suppose to send me in originally in the add). I said of course!!! I received them in less than a week.</li>
    <li> I had been sucked into the whole &amp;#34;more blades is better&amp;#34; mentality but no more.  The thin blades are a little troublesome to handle as they are super thin and super sharp but nothing you can&#x27;t handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried to use the actual single razor with shaving cream yet...I usually do a dry shave when I&#x27;m in a hurry....but the single blade works pretty well.  I think the performance will be much better once I get the shaving cream but overall, really like the single blade and definitely love the better price!</li>
    <li> Really like these. Just getting into DE shaving, so only comparison is feather. I think these are just as good/sharp and perhaps a little more durable. Only got 2 shaves out of a feather. I&#x27;ll see if these can double that today. That&#x27;s the thing that&#x27;s a little disappointing about DEs--the blades don&#x27;t last. I could shave comfortably for a month with one Schick multiblade cartridge.</li>
    <li> nice blades, give great shave</li>
    <li> The blades are sharp! I cut my fingers trying to get the blade into the razor! Cuts the beard too, but I am no longer using the razor.</li>
    <li> These blades are NOT stainless steel as some have reported. They are chromium, ceramic coated and PFTE(?). I wanted to try a double edge razor to see what all the hub bub was about.  I tried the blades that came with (stainless) and these. I didn&#x27;t like the shave with either. I will go back to my Trac II type, non-pivoting, heavier handle. I get a great shave with a trac II handle aka &#x27;bump fighter razor&#x27; - rubberized non-pivoting black with a nice weight and balance. I remember when Trac II came out. SNL was new and did a spoof commercial saying &amp;#34;Trac 3 because you&#x27;ll believe anything&amp;#34;. Now we&#x27;re up to 5 and 6 blades in a cartridge. Personna sells Trac II stainless blades here in bulk at great prices.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed you can probally get a better electric shave. At least they are pretty cheap. I prefer these over a disposable or a more expensive one.</li>
    <li> Schick Wilkinson Sword Double Edge single Razor Cartridge, 5 blades&lt;br /&gt;Works well, easy to use, price was good. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Been using these for a few months now and am happy with the shave.  The blades that came with my razor had the sides and edges numbered 1-4, which I thought was a nice feature if you wanted to use one side exclusively until it wore and then use the other side.  This product doesn&#x27;t have that feature which won&#x27;t prevent me from ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t rec&#x27;d these yet, however, I&#x27;m going to go out on a limb here.  I used these blades before and got good shaves out of them.  Razor blades are all different.  Sometimes even with the more expensive and exotic you can get a bum blade, and everyone should already know this if they ever used any type of razor.</li>
    <li> Cheap!&lt;br /&gt;Boyfriend uses these all the time!&lt;br /&gt;He was super happy, and so was i!&lt;br /&gt;Came earlier than i thought as well.</li>
    <li> I introduced my dad to using a safety razor a couple years ago. He tried Wilkinson blades and found them to be sharper and give a cleaner shave than the Merkur blades. I started having problems with the Merkur blades, too--nicks, razor burn, etc. I learned through some research that Wilkinson makes the sharpest blades on the market. So, at dad&#x27;s suggestion, I tried them again and love them. They cut close to the skin, don&#x27;t leave nicks (unless I forget to change the blade), and don&#x27;t leave razor burn. I think I was too inexperienced when I first tried them.  Just for reference, here&#x27;s my original review from a few years ago: Usually I use Merkur blades, but I saw these available and figured, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be fine.&amp;#34; The blades felt dull; they were flimsy, and a couple of the blades in the pack had grime on them when I opened them. My skin was irritated like never before and I got more small cuts than I had from my safety razor since...well, ever, really. Immediately, I hopped on Amazon and ordered a pack of the Merkur blades.</li>
    <li> Still a great blade.  Used to get it in rite aids, etch, now hard to find</li>
    <li> love these blades , i will be ordering them again soon</li>
    <li> These blades are awesome will purchase again</li>
    <li> Like the product.. but more so I like the availability.  Cannot find these blades in any of the major chain supermarkets or pharmacies in my area.</li>
    <li> What to say, sharp as ever and a name right out of the past.  I remember the Wilkinson blade adds from my childhood.  Still a great blade.</li>
    <li> Tried a few different brands, but the Wilkinson Sword seem to give the best shave, they are smooth and don&#x27;t snag or drag across my skin.  I&#x27;ve got a heavy beard and these work great.</li>
    <li> Nice product, good and sharp.  As good as Gillette.</li>
    <li> Sharp double edged razor blades.  Product gives a good shave.  Not recommended for the weak . . . . .</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t find these blades any better than all the others I have tried. I think, know, the razor is more important than the blade choice. If the razor can not hold the blade in perfect alignment, laterally and pitch angle, you will not get a good clean shave. The wrong pitch angle is critical or you will get a scraping not a shave.</li>
    <li> I give them 5 stars because they&#x27;re of consistent manufacture. I&#x27;ve tried these out for a while now, off and on, over the last year. The experience I get from these are very consistent from blade to blade. Other blades I&#x27;ve tried occasionally throw a bad blade in. I haven&#x27;t seen that with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, about the blade, this is a very mild edged blade. If Feather and Personna Lab are 9.5-10/10 in terms of sharpness, I would rate these somewhere in the neighborhood of Derby. These would rank a 2-3/10. Don&#x27;t be mislead by that, it speaks nothing to the quality of the blade or the shave. Matter of fact, this is a fine blade. There is a perfect blade and razor combo for every face that is going to vary based on skin and beard type. If you find that Feather are too harsh, try a medium blade, like Astra SP, and if that&#x27;s also hard on you, give these a whirl. Conversely, if these are chewing your face up, try out Astra SP. They&#x27;re an excellent quality 6/10 sharpness blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I don&#x27;t like these blades for my face. Lord, Derby, and the like are just too mild for me. These pull and tug as I shave, a good indication that the blade is too mild. That aside, they are friendly and easy to shave with. In spite of the immediate discomfort, they leave me with smooth, irritation-free shaves, hence I don&#x27;t mind continuing to test them. And I can use the blade for a week of daily shaves and see little or no change in the performance of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And just a tip, when trying out a new blade, before passing final judgement, give it a solid week of shaves with a single blade. Even if the first round isn&#x27;t great, give it a solid week, or 4-7 shaves, to really evaluate the blade fairly. Your first shave might be atrocious, but I&#x27;ve found with some blades that once the first shave or two passes, I get the best shaves I could ask for. Other blades I find I can use for two weeks of daily shaves with good results, which I would not have known if I never evaluated the deterioration of the edge over time. And other blades start out giving me great shaves, but they peter out quickly, leaving me with 3-4 good shaves before I have to change blades. Personally, I&#x27;ll sacrifice the best shave I can get for a blade that I can change out once a week and still get a great shave with. But in the end, it&#x27;s all about what pleases your senses, not mine, so happy shaving!</li>
    <li> This blades are ok since I have a very thick beard. Good for beginners with thin beards. You will not cut your face with these.</li>
    <li> These are excellent razors. I pair them with my Edwing Jagger DE89 and I get excellent shaves every time. They&#x27;re quite sharp, though I would say they&#x27;re less sharp than Feather blades. Of all the blades I&#x27;ve tried so far with my EJ these are my favorite.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t need more than one blade to shave. I get a great shave with these.  So, save a boatload of money and go retro.  I also use them to score my bread dough.</li>
    <li> I guess I must have thicker beard than average because these tug a bit for me. I never really experience other beards to compare except mine so I didn&#x27;t realize mine was considered thick (maybe the feeling of my beard still being rough even after a long hot shower should&#x27;ve been a hint). Anyway, These aren&#x27;t the blades for me. I just ordered Feather blades so we&#x27;ll see how that one works out. Glad I bought these samples before getting a huge number of them.</li>
    <li> After trying out several different types of blades for my safety razors, Wilkinson Sword has come out in the top three.  I have been able to get at least three shaves out of each blade, and these are consistently comfortable.  Not too aggressive, but still able to provide an exceptionally close shave.</li>
    <li> I love these blades. Just seem to be sharper than the slightly less Persona&#x27;s, although that may be all in my mind.  But these are all I&#x27;m gonna order from now on.</li>
    <li> Feather Blades are far superior.</li>
    <li> Through no fault of the blade, I needed some that were sharper. I wound up trying three types before I finally settled on feather blades. There is a reason these are popular. They are right for most faces and legs. My wife uses them on her legs. She loves them.&lt;br /&gt;The blades are quality made but I had to go with a different sharpness.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely try these if you are a beginner!</li>
    <li> These stay sharp for multiple shaves, and close shaves at that. The dispenser has a compartment for used blades - which is a nice addition. If you are looking for an affordable quality blade for your DE safety razor - give these a try.</li>
    <li> Nice blades, gave a nice shave.</li>
    <li> Any one still aye a safety razor, you know, that butterfly opening, you drop blade into, twist to close, and watch the &amp;#34;wings&amp;#34; fold down holding the blade in place?&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t tried these yet, but when I was a tyke too young to shave I saw commercials for Wilkinson  blades- my father used them I&#x27;ve tried Feather, AM,&lt;br /&gt;Something starting with  D--- and Merkur, and others.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t found one that really shaves well, smooth, without irrating me skin. 4 stars by reputation of name.</li>
    <li> figure i&#x27;d give these a try, they werent for me. I&#x27;m personally a Bic and Gillette guy right now, I&#x27;m using an Edwin Jagger DE89. these are somewhat aggressive for me with my DE89. I like that nice smooth glide across my face, these almost felt like they were pulling hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give em a go though, who knows, you might like em! they jsut weren&#x27;t for me!</li>
    <li> Had not seen Wilkinson product over-the-counter in years.  Quite pleased with my purchase.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have used one blade so far, and I have had 5 clean and cut-free shaves from one blade.  I have a semi thick and coarse beard.  Very good blades.</li>
    <li> Great blades - give a very close shave.</li>
    <li> One of the best razor blades ever manufactured.  A little pricey but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Great blades, hard to find in most stores</li>
    <li> Glad they still make these, they give a much better shave the the fru fru 3, 4, and 5 blade fad razors</li>
    <li> boyfriend likes very much.</li>
    <li> Sharp, long lasting blades.  Very little irritation.  Remain sharp through repeated shaves and appear to be better than your average drug or discount store house brands.  When you are done shaving, rinse them thoroughly under hot running water and they will last.</li>
    <li> These blades are cheap.  They made in Germany and I have heard that most razor blades are made in Solingen.  These must have come from the reject pile.</li>
    <li> No complaints here.  These are my first so I have nothing to compare to, but they seem to be working well for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 43 now. I remember as a little boy (5-6yrs. old) I use to shave with my Dad using a butterfly style safety razor (I use to use it without a razor of course) I wanted a good razor so I went shopping and ended up buyiing Gillette Mach Razor. This razor was horrible and the amount of money I paid for this sorry razor was unreal. Then a thought came back &amp;#34;what about a safety razor just like my Dad&#x27;s&amp;#34; Went ahead and purchased one that came with a razor tried it............the best thing to shave with, no hair getting stuck between blades, no overspending on a useless item, and lasts a life time. All double edge razors cut different. Wilkinson works best for me I love these razors.</li>
    <li> Are you looking for razors that not only do the job, but are able to do the job time and time again?  What if I told you that you can use the same razorblade for several weeks possibly even MONTHS, and they only get slightly dull as time goes on?  That&#x27;s exactly what makes Wilkinson Sword razors MUCH better than every other razorblade company I&#x27;ve tried thus far.  The best part is that these excellent razors are sold relatively cheap at your local Dollar General store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this, I&#x27;m NOT making this up.  I shave every 3-4 days (I have to otherwise I get really itchy!).  From July of last year until January of this year, I&#x27;ve been using exactly ONE Wilkinson razor the whole time.  By late October it finally got a little dull, but it didn&#x27;t completely wear out until January of this year.  If I can go 6 months using the same exact razor... why bother buying any other brand of razors?  It&#x27;s clear to me that Wilkinson Sword is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend ignoring popularity, ignore the ads you see on TV (particularly during sporting events) showing off the top name companies with some pretty boy shaving happily in his bathroom mirror while some generic cheesy macho music plays in the background, and go with Wilkinson Sword.  They won&#x27;t let you down.</li>
    <li> So this blade did great on my head but failed at my neck, it tended to tug and burn on the pass.  I neck hairs have always given me trouble so I plan on a two razor system one for head shaving and one for beard shaving.</li>
    <li> Not 100% if I like these or not, but I suppose you&#x27;ll never know from me since this is all I&#x27;ll post about it. Maybe give it a try for yourself?</li>
    <li> Got these in only a few days.  But had to wait for my razor to come for two weeks.  Finally got to try them out this weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are nice blades, glide smoothly, really sharp.  This was my first double edge shave and they gave me no problems.</li>
    <li> Great ! as promised !</li>
    <li> Best blades on the market!</li>
    <li> These work awesome, and a great bang for the buck!</li>
    <li> These blades are just as the product review I&#x27;ve read say; not exceptionally sharp compared to the &#x27;sharpest&#x27; of the bunch rated brands, but nice and forgiving for the less than expert double-edge shaver.  They are plenty sharp to deliver a close shave.</li>
    <li> Tried many brands, definitely not my favorite.</li>
    <li> These are decent blades but a little too dull for my taste. I get a better shave with feather blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth a try and maybe better suited in a slant or adjustable.</li>
    <li> cut myself badly, maybe too flexible</li>
    <li> I have extremely coarse stubble and these blades feel like they are dull before I&#x27;m finished with a single use.  The price is ok if you have finer/softer hair.</li>
    <li> With blades you and your face can&#x27;t afford to experiment. These are in my go-to top 5 and have been for years. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because of the overall experience I had while using the Wilkinson Sword DE razor blades. I am a new proponent to wet-shaving and I have been experimenting with different blades, trying to find the best one for my skin/beard type. I have only tried three brands so far: Dorco (Korea) Derby Extra (Turkey) and the Wilkinson Sword (Germany). These blades seem to work very well for me and my skin/beard. I found that the Dorcos gave me an okay shave, considering my experience so far and the Derby&#x27;s ...well, I didn&#x27;t care for them much, they seemed to be too dull for my liking but again this is with somewhat junior experience. The Wilkinson sword left my face feeling nice and smooth after two passes and I ended up with no nicks or cuts. As far as longevity, I have not yet put them to the test but for most blades, I have been getting 5-7 shaves. I truly think that the way sharpness feels is personal. Each different blade will feel different to each person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these blades to anyone who is searching for a blade that is sharper than most &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34; cheaper blades but not so sharp that it will bloody up your face and neck. And for the price, they are a good choice.</li>
    <li> I got a sample pack of Derby blades that came with my DE Razor purchase. After using those blades for a few weeks I questioned whether DE shaving was for me as I got constant nicks and irritation with so so results. However Wilkinson came to the rescue. Once I used these my shave was near flawless, and one of the smoothest and closest I have ever had with only one pass.  I have thick coarse facial hair and these blades make short work of it.</li>
    <li> I would recommend these blades bc they are just as they should be, not like the new 3,4,5...edge blades that are so hard to clean out w/o banging them on the sink &amp; leaving dents in the acrylic bowls.</li>
    <li> Rate this five stars on the price alone, the product should be very good if it meets previous standards.  I have not used the blades yet, but had purchased them before; I could not pass up the great price and bought an 8 month supply.  Recommend this product to anyone wanting to shave well at an economical price.</li>
    <li> If you are deciding on what blade to get with your new safety razor, buy a variety pack and try as many blades as you can.  There is a blade made for your beard.  These blades work very well on my beard which is thick heavy growth.  I can get 3 3-pass shaves or 5-6 1-pass shaves.  (If 1-pass vs. 3-pass is throwing you, do yourself and face a favor and check out badgerandblade dot com).  I find that these are not as aggressive as a Shark, sharper than Astra and give me a very close shave without doing much damage.  But as the subject line reads &amp;#34;Your Mileage May Vary&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Happy Shaves!</li>
    <li> I have been a double edge user since 1965 and this was always my favorite brand. My favorite within the brand was the &amp;#34;Platinum&amp;#34; model.</li>
    <li> I am relatively new to the art of wet shaving with a safety razor, but I&#x27;m proud to say I have become more adept at using one. The Parker 99R that I own came with some Shark Super Chrome blades which I did not care for very much. After researching different blades online(I&#x27;ll include one of the links I found to be particularly helpful), the Wilkinson Sword blades became my weapon of choice! They are sharp yet extremely forgiving and the synthetic polymer coating definitely makes for a less irritating shave!    I religiously try to shave every morning so I&#x27;ve never had a beard or any heavy facial hair growth. However my hair seems to grow back quickly so that 5 o&#x27; clock shadow always bothered me. The Wilkinson Sword blades gave me a superb shave that reduced what stubble I had into smooth skin. I&#x27;ve also found I can get a close shave with fewer passes and in a shorter amount of time than the Shark Super Chrome blades I had originally used. I have had no nicks or cuts either, which surprised me given how aggressive the blade can be with hair.    I know there are many other types of razor brands out there(I recommend buying a sample pack), but Wilkinson Sword seems to be the perfect match for my needs. If you&#x27;re lucky enough to have the same experience as I did with these babies then I hope this review helped! Here&#x27;s that link I promised to those of you who are still unsure:    [...]</li>
    <li> These blades are about as \\&quot;solid\\&quot; as they come. No variance between blade quality, and the shave clean and sharp. Inexpensive, and better quality than many of the higher-priced brands. For my money, Wilkinson Swords and PERSONNA Blues are the best value in DE Blades available these days.</li>
    <li> I bought several packages of Wilkinson Sword Classic blades on the same Amazon order as a Parker traditional safety razor. My opinion is that the limiting factor of a good razor could very well be the blades. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with either purchase.</li>
    <li> Excellent seller and product they work very well and lsat.I will recommend to friends and family.</li>
    <li> your mileage may vary but for me it works well and its a great price, i also like feather blades.</li>
    <li> A little disappointing, Not as good as they used to be!&lt;br /&gt;Bill Graf</li>
    <li> Sharp, get about 4 cuts before it starts to nick you up.  Solid razors.</li>
    <li> Just buys these!  the best of the best !!</li>
    <li> Great quick arrival will get plenty of use out of these</li>
    <li> Favorite DE blades next to Personna blades.&lt;br /&gt;From my experience, seem to be a 7.5/10 in the &amp;#34;sharpness scale&amp;#34;, with 1 being weird generic blades, and 10 being Feathers.&lt;br /&gt;Maintain a nice edge, and need to be replaced every 3-5 shaves, depending on skin sensitivity and beard coarseness.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotta say for such a popular blade with such high reviews, I just wasn&#x27;t that impressed. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is a good middle of the road blade. But I&#x27;ve gone through two of those large &amp;#34;variety&amp;#34; packs with about 15 diff blades in each and this blade just didn&#x27;t knock my socks off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gave me a good shave, again im not saying this is a bad blade. But for me it just didn&#x27;t live up to all the rave reviews I&#x27;ve read. It&#x27;s a 3/5 blade, good, but won&#x27;t be buying these in packs. Too many other better blades out there.</li>
    <li> Buy it it&#x27;s still an excellent blade.</li>
    <li> Very good blades, especially for the price.  Comfortable to use and are a nice balance between a sharp blade and one that will forgive a new wet-shaver&#x27;s mistakes.  As high quality as anything else that&#x27;s made in Germany.  I&#x27;ve since switched to Feather blades because they&#x27;re sharper, but these are my second favorite.</li>
    <li> Nothing shaves like a straight edge</li>
    <li> ok but not as good as Gillette Russian blades</li>
    <li> These blades didn&#x27;t turn me on.  I&#x27;m convinced that the sharper the blade the better and Feather&#x27;s are the sharpest I&#x27;ve found so far and they don&#x27;t snag.  (I&#x27;ve got a tough beard)  Sharper blades don&#x27;t hurt your skin any more, in fact, they should be better.  Duller blades just yank on the hair and scrape up your skin.  A slanted razor makes it even smoother.</li>
    <li> way better than the razor blade that came with the straight razor I bought....but be careful....its sharp~~  I cut myself because I was pressing just as hard on my skin as I had to with the &#x27;stock&#x27; razor...yikes, two big cuts.  After that, I used it lightly and cut great!</li>
    <li> Next to the old King Gillette blue double edge blade there is nothing better in my opinion. Wilkerson has been around for a very long time and continues to make great shaving blades. You can spend more on other similar blades but I don&#x27;t think you will get anymore that what these blades offer for the price.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s my technique, but these are the only blades that I get nicked with.  Much prefer 7am or Feather blades.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve tried Feathers, Astras, Sharks and Wilkinson.  Of course, everyone is different, but these were really rough on my face.  I won&#x27;t be using them again.  I tried shaving with them twice.  I have a very thick, wirey beard.  So far I&#x27;ll stick with Feathers and Astras.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast. Blade dulls easily and not super sharp. Good beginner blade.</li>
    <li> Meh!  Not good quality.</li>
    <li> Wilkinson makes some of the best products, high end merch at great prices.  My Son and I both use this brands razors and we always reorder more.</li>
    <li> Great product. Very quick service. Would order again.</li>
    <li> I love these blades,  use them on my Edwin Jagger Safety razor also purchased from amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Saving tons of money by Not buying Gillette pro-glide blades anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Real Men use real razors!</li>
    <li> I tried different blades. This is the best!</li>
    <li> These blades are sharp and work great for my beard/skin type. They are comparable to feather but priced better. I get 5 shaves easy with them before having to change the blade. I have moderate growth and sensitive skin. They are made in Germany and much cheaper than the German Merkur blades. I don&#x27;t know of any other German blades except these and Merkur and will be sticking with these as long as I can. YMMV.</li>
    <li> These are good blades.  I got a good, close shave but with a bit of irritation.  They&#x27;re not the best blades I have used but they are closer to the best than the worst!</li>
    <li> Quite simply the best. I received a package of Derby blades with my razor and Wilkinsons, which I&#x27;ve used for years, are superior.</li>
    <li> I prefer using this product in my Grandfather&#x27;s old safety razor, than I do all of the multi bladed, more expensive modern razors out there.  They last longer and are more cost effective.  I hope Amazon will continue to carry them as they are impossible to find anywhere else.</li>
    <li> I was looking for another blade to try and saw the good reviews on this one. I just used one tonight and right off the bat, drags. I don&#x27;t know what the problem is are they dull? Or are they old? I had to take it out in the middle of my shave and put my three day old Astra in! It&#x27;s very disappointing. I&#x27;ll try again and update if any better.</li>
    <li> My favorite blades so far.  I will be ordering these again.</li>
    <li> I have used these blades for years.  Started while stationed in the UK in early 1960&#x27;s.  Best blades on the market.</li>
    <li> Reliably good for 4-5 close shaves.  Reasonably comfortable, consistent quality, and fairly priced.  While Feathers are my current fave because my beard needs the sharpest blade out there, Wilkinson Classics still make my top 5 for DE blades.</li>
    <li> very sharp, very close</li>
    <li> Good quality and excellent price!</li>
    <li> The glide on these is amazing. They don&#x27;t last more than 3 shaves for me, but they are like butter for three days.</li>
    <li> Bought as a present, arrived as expected and experienced no problems.</li>
    <li> Got these for my husband.  He says they work great &amp; kept an edge for multiple shaves.</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t &#x27;regular&#x27; razor blades. They are &#x27;flimsy&#x27; and not great for cutting without a blade holder</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and convenient. Retro is great day to day shave compared to very expensive modern multiple blades. I use still use multiple blade for special occasions.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the finest double-edged blades around.  Each blade is individually wrapped.  And the price is the cherry on top!</li>
    <li> Does the job, and cheap</li>
    <li> Perfect. Unlike what you get in Walmart &amp; Target. These have the perfect close shave.</li>
    <li> Blades are the ultimate YMMV...these work ok, but prefer other brands.  For others however, these may be great, you have to try them to find out.</li>
    <li> I find these blades give a good shave for as many as seven days.  Good vlalue.  I thought that Wilkinson had disappeared in the 80s.</li>
    <li> Provide a clean and comfortable shave. A little pricier than bargain blades but they shave WORLDS better than some of the cheaper brands like Personna. I can also compare them to Feather, which a lot of people rave about.  Feather shave very smoothly and they are fine on my face, but they give me TERRIBLE razor burn on my neck.  WS blades are the best of both worlds, extremely sharp and also extremely smooth and forgiving on the skin.  They come in a plastic box which can safely hold your used blades.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with them.  You can get a 100 pack for less than $20 that will last you 1 - 2 years.  Don&#x27;t waste your time trying to pinch pennies on inferior blades, this is your face you&#x27;re talking about!  PROS: * Extremely sharp, but also smooth shaving * Coated with chromium, ceramic, and teflon.  In my experience this does deliver a smooth shave * Comes with plastic boxes for blade disposal.  Many cheaper brands do not.  CONS: * On the pricier side.  Still, you can buy 100 of these for less than 20 bucks...  OVERALL: * My go-to blade.  Great combination of sharpness and smoothness.  For me, unbeatable.</li>
    <li> ...your two cents will undoubtedly vary. Worst razor burn ever, I would rather use a cheap single blade single use disposable. Having said that they were pretty sharp and cut close, they just don&#x27;t agree with my face. One of the things I&#x27;ve learned about DE razors is that reviews like this are nearly useless as everyone seems to have a different experience. Your pre-shave prep, choice of soap or cream,  water hardness , razor, beard, skin, and technique will all influence your experience. Just because these  blades didn&#x27;t put a smile on my face doesn&#x27;t mean they won&#x27;t put one on yours. For the price of a five pack what have you got to lose?</li>
    <li> Just like any other blade I&#x27;ve tried. They don&#x27;t last any longer than the ones I buy at the discount store.</li>
    <li> Impressed by the smoothness and glide. I will buy again</li>
    <li> Been using Atra Platinums with great success , figured I&#x27;d give these a try. Not nearly as sharp, they did not work for me but blades are very subjective and personal.My worst could be your best and vice versa.</li>
    <li> I have a full beard and choose not to shave but once a year.  So I purchased these blades to use with a bread lame for baking various types of loaves.  I&#x27;d had trouble previously with the blade not being sharp enough to cut the dough, but these blades are fantastic!  They slice right through the stickiest of doughs and make for incredible bread.</li>
    <li> Have used these for years.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Terrible razor blades; they do not provide a clean shave. I prefer the [[ASIN:B004SGKMA0 Derby Extra]] or [[ASIN:B004RWTQTS Feather]] blades.</li>
    <li> I get a smoother cut with fewer passes than my previous blade. I also get 3 or 4 nicks a week where I didn&#x27;t get any with the previous. All in all, it&#x27;s a good trade. I will be buying more of these.</li>
    <li> For my whiskers, I HATED these blades. The only thing worse was Dorco.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to shaving with double edge razors. The Wilkinson is better than the blade provided with the merker razor.</li>
    <li> A Really Good Blade.&lt;br /&gt;I bought these on sale as Amazon had a sale on this item so i bought a pack as they are a good blade and as usual Amazons price -CANNOT- be beat sic!.&lt;br /&gt;These might be a -Little Sharp- for some folks so i rate them 4 Stars but my beard is tough as Heck so they work good for me, I used to get these from Wal Mart but they quit selling them so Amazons by favorite seller and thats OK cause I get the best prices here too.&lt;br /&gt;Nuff Said!..........&lt;br /&gt;IndianaED</li>
    <li> As described. These blades are awesome.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat a shave with anew blade. These a prices so you can change them often.</li>
    <li> A great blade. Was using Derby blades originally and wanted to try another brand. These gave a much better shave than the Derby.</li>
    <li> Bought a single 5 blade sample pack to try out.  All five blades had some brown stains on them.  Looked like rust or some kind of dirt.  So I could not use them.  Since I had unwrapped and discarded each dirty blade, and it was only $ 1.49, I didn&#x27;t return them.      Update:  1-star for the rusty blades.  5-stars for Amazon customer service who refunded my $1.49 + tax despite the fact that I didn&#x27;t return the blades.</li>
    <li> Great blades at a great price!&lt;br /&gt;Bought these for a cheap Chinese made razor I ordered partly for the nostalgia of using a double edge and to have an inexpensive backup razor. Talk about a close shave! Way closer shave than the 5 blade system I&#x27;ve been using!&lt;br /&gt;Like the commercial for one of those as seen on TV razors says &amp;#34;you only need one blade&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m giving serious thought to going back to using this type of blade for everyday use as the cost of refill cartages is outrageous, at times it seems cheaper to just replace the whole razor. I&#x27;m thinking using these blades will be a major money saver over the long run.</li>
    <li> just seems ok. blades are subjective but for me, I seem to get a better shave with the astra&#x27;s or derby&#x27;s. so far, sticking with astras as they work well and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Wow! These are amazing! Perfect for all areas, and I haven&#x27;t nicked myself even though Im a rank beginner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I ordered these after trying the Derby blades that came with my razor seemed to drag on my tougher armpit and sensitive area hairs. They were shipped by overstockdrugstore and came in 4 days. I was thrilled. They cut smooth as glass even going against the grain. Definitely will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I was under the impression these were pre-scored...maybe they are and I am missing something, but whenever I try to snap them in half for use with my shavette, they bend. This makes them difficult to insert into my shaving apparatus.</li>
    <li> Went to my local &amp;#34;all in one store&amp;#34; and bought the only Double Edge (generic) blades for sale.  Felt like I was scraping my face with a dull rock.  Fortunately, the store gave me my $$ back.  I bought these Wilkinson razor blades on Amazon.  Wow!  What a difference.  Free shipping too.</li>
    <li> Best blades out there.  Still one my first blade.  I got 20 great shaves from one side, and now I am using the other edge.  I bought 100 blades, enough to last me about 8 years of shaving every day.</li>
    <li> These blades are the first blades I&#x27;ve bought that I get really excited about. I&#x27;m sure there are other awesome blades out there, but these feel clean, fast, and sharp.</li>
    <li> These blades didn&#x27;t cut any of my beard; very disappointing, they only scratched across the surface. The Merkur blades are far superior. [ASIN:B000JPMHWK Merkur-Razor Double Edge Razor Blades]</li>
    <li> My review is coming from the perspective of somebody who is just now switching to a double edge safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are amazing.  They cut nice and close, and if you shave every day they do not pull your beard.  I get closer in two passes than I did in 3 with  my old mach 3.  Also, they are not nearly as irritating.</li>
    <li> These are the classic old style double edge razor blades.  Each blade is wrapped in paper to prevent cuts when taking out of the holder.</li>
    <li> These are good for beginners to start with but had a tendency to tug more than feathers do, but do get the job done.</li>
    <li> I really like these blades. I shave every morning and change them once a week.</li>
