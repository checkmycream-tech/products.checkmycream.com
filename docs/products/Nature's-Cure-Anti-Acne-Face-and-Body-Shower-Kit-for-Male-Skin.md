### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>but I am very happy with this!</li>
      <li>This is a great acne product!</li>
      <li>I promise you that this is the best acne kit out there for all acne sufferers.</li>
      <li>But, the bottom line is that this product is very effective and will grant you the victory in the war against acne.</li>
      <li>I love how it smells!</li>
      <li>Great product that keeps the skin acne free.</li>
      <li>The face wash smells strongly of chlorine bleach, so it&#x27;s either degraded to the point of being hazardous or has been adulterated.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>about 12 hours to reduce the redness and a couple more to make it disappear.</li>
      <li>Before discovering this wonderful product, I tried everything from Neutrogena products to ProActive and even some prescription pills such as Erythromycin.</li>
      <li>Title is true and says it all.  </li>
      <li>The 2-Part system was the most successful product I have ever used, but they stopped selling it in stores by me, so I figured I would try something new from the same company, but to no avail.</li>
      <li>Glad I found that Amazon offers Nature&#x27;s Cure because drugstore.com is now charging $30 for this kit.</li>
      <li>Although, I was looking for a more natural face wash and stumbled across this product in a store</li>
      <li>Nature&#x27;s Cure does wonders for your skin and leaves it clean and clear in a matter of days.</li>
      <li>Also, it is noteworthy that this product is very consistent in keeping your skin clear and preventing pimples from forming.</li>
      <li>I highly encourage this product!</li>
      <li>I will be looking for more in the near future.</li>
      <li>This product really works my husband and son both use it, if used as directed this will clear up any problems you are having with acne.</li>
      <li>The packaging was unopened and new.</li>
      <li>The first few times I used it my skin dried out fast, but I found it effective to use a face moisturizer after I apply the face lotion that Nature&#x27;s Cure provides.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 25 year old male, I have a very stressful job as a manager and don&#x27;t have the time to take care of my skin.</li>
      <li>I am often too busy to take care of my skin and to watch what I eat.</li>
      <li>Over the past few years I have gone through so many acne curing products and none have worked!</li>
      <li>I am not a male so not really sure if the female specific product would work better</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The expiration dates were cut off.  The liquid ingredients of the face wash and the lotion were separated/weird texture.  Do not buy!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Over the past few years I have gone through so many acne curing products and none have worked! I was very skeptical at first before purchasing Nature&#x27;s Cure, but after using it for one month I have seen a drastic change in my skin. I am a college student and I also work. I am often too busy to take care of my skin and to watch what I eat. I am often frustrated and stressed so it took a toll on my skin over the past few months. I have used proactive, medicated creams, smelly face wash, and cleansing pads and all is not comparable to Nature&#x27;s Cure. I love how it smells! This product does not smell too fruity or too harsh, it smells very gentle and subtle. The first few times I used it my skin dried out fast, but I found it effective to use a face moisturizer after I apply the face lotion that Nature&#x27;s Cure provides. I still get pimples here and there, however it takes Nature&#x27;s Cure about 12 hours to reduce the redness and a couple more to make it disappear. I highly encourage this product!</li>
    <li> Caused extreme irritation to my husband&#x27;s face. He turned beet red and said it felt like a really bad sunburn. I do not recommend at all, this product needs to be pulled.</li>
    <li> This product really works my husband and son both use it, if used as directed this will clear up any problems you are having with acne.</li>
    <li> I promise you that this is the best acne kit out there for all acne sufferers. Before discovering this wonderful product, I tried everything from Neutrogena products to ProActive and even some prescription pills such as Erythromycin. Nature&#x27;s Cure does wonders for your skin and leaves it clean and clear in a matter of days.

But, the bottom line is that this product is very effective and will grant you the victory in the war against acne.</li>
    <li> This product is impossible to find in our local stores, so I was surprised to find it available online. The product arrived not only swiftly but in excellant condition. The packaging was unopened and new. I will be looking for more in the near future. My grandson uses this product and it is the only one with excellant results for his \\&quot;teen\\&quot; breakouts.</li>
    <li> I purchased two packs of this product for my two teenage boys. In both cases it dried out the skin and appeared to make the problem worse. Not something they or I would give and endorsement.</li>
    <li> Title is true and says it all.  I have sensitive skin and slight rosacea.  After using this product for a while now, I no longer take any prescription meds.  Yes it stains clothing, towels, pillow cases, etc. But those are just \\&quot;things\\&quot; and relatively of no value vs. having confidence in my appearance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years now! Great product that keeps the skin acne free. To bad many store discontinued selling it!</li>
    <li> This is a great acne product! Although, I was looking for a more natural face wash and stumbled across this product in a store (this company is all online now so you will not find it in stores). I have fair skin and sometimes terrible break outs on my face. This product has never let me down, usually clearing up my acne within a day or two. I do not use it everyday, just when I have breakouts. I am not a male so not really sure if the female specific product would work better but I am very happy with this! I thought it a little on the expensive side but will pay extra for a product that works.</li>
    <li> Someone attempted to cut the expiration date off the crimped end of the tubes in this package. Unfortunately for them, they missed the year on one (2011) - these products expired THREE YEARS AGO. The face wash smells strongly of chlorine bleach, so it&#x27;s either degraded to the point of being hazardous or has been adulterated. Amazon needs to pull this item...</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my teen nephew about a year ago and forgot all about it. . .until he approached me to ask where I got it.  He said it&#x27;s the only thing that works.  So I put in another order for him.</li>
    <li> If this works.. it didn&#x27;t work for me. I did everything as advised and nothing seems to stop. I&#x27;m a 25 year old male, I have a very stressful job as a manager and don&#x27;t have the time to take care of my skin. I rely on the simple take a shower, use the products as advised and see a difference. No such luck. If it worked for others, I&#x27;m the other 50% I suppose. Back on the hunt..</li>
    <li> This is the only product that works for my skin condition. I have cystic acne and nothing else works to keep it under control. It takes a few weeks for it to really clear your skin up but once it does it is a miracle. Once or twice daily. Glad I found that Amazon offers Nature&#x27;s Cure because drugstore.com is now charging $30 for this kit.</li>
    <li> my son has bad acne and this seems to be working</li>
    <li> Nature&#x27;s Cure products have worked for me in the past, specifically the 2-Part system with the pills which I&#x27;ve converted back to after this product failed me.  After two days of using the product, my torso broke out so severely, it was by far the worst acne I&#x27;ve ever had.  I know it was the shower gel portion, because that&#x27;s the only step I used on my body.  I&#x27;ve never had bad acne on my chest, just a few pesky guys that would appear every now and then.  I was hoping this would take care of that problem, but the result was just the opposite.  I understand everyone has different reactions to different products, so not everyone I&#x27;ll get the result I had.  The 2-Part system was the most successful product I have ever used, but they stopped selling it in stores by me, so I figured I would try something new from the same company, but to no avail.</li>
    <li> it made my son brakeouts worse and he  had a a really bad bad reaction to it then when used with the light his face swelled up</li>
