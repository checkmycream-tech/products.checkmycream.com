      <li>I love not having to sleep with it all night!  </li>
      <li>It works amazingly well.</li>

      <li>These twist off easily and do the job!</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for year  and have always enjoyed my pearly whites.</li>
      <li>I love getting this product.</li>
      <li>and I love it .</li>
      <li>I love this whitener and I paid more than 2x Amazon&#x27;s price at my dentists</li>
      <li>I was buying it from my dentist who was charging me quite a bit more than what I paid for it through Amazon.</li>
      <li>Easy.</li>
      <li>Great stuff, white teeth!</li>
      <li>The original NiteWhite I received from the dentist ran out</li>
      <li>the dentist originally provided me with.  </li>
      <li>Good price, but not sure how effective it is.  </li>
      <li>Tonight will be my 2nd application and expect even better results, along with more sensitivity that will go away after about 24 hours.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been making a special trip to my dentist and spending much more on the same product.  </li>
      <li>Super fast shipping, item exactly as described</li>
      <li>I have had two different dental assistants tell me that the Zoom does most of it&#x27;s whittening in the first 45 min. of use.  </li>
      <li>, I get so many compliments on how white my teeth are.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what I need to whiten my teeth as the doctor ordered.</li>
      <li>EXACTLY WHERE IT CAME FROM, I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO EXCHANGE, THANK YOU.</li>
      <li>My teeth are super sensitive to the MINT</li>
      <li>Teeth are much whiter.</li>
      <li>, I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO ORDER ANOTHER ONE FOR MY DAUGHTER,</li>
      <li>and it REALLY</li>
      <li>This gel does a much better job than the store bought whitening strips or other options I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>My friends easily notice the brighter smile that this product achieves where as I don&#x27;t get similar compliments from other store bought options.  </li>
      <li>It took a few  more treatments</li>
      <li>After buying the official take-home Zoom whitening kit from my local dentist, I went online to try to locate the exact product sold as refills for $60 per 3-syringe pack.  </li>
      <li>and although my teeth are brighter, I do not think they are as white as I&#x27;d like, especially after using a full syringe.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Occasionally my teeth feel a bit sensitive when I take off my whitening trays, but this goes away with 15 minutes</li>
      <li>AS FAR AS KEEPING TIME</li>
      <li>Just fyi, other whitening products from Smile Medic have been reported as suspicious/possibly tampered with.</li>
      <li>Now retired, I&#x27;m glad to be able to still purchase it, less expensively, here.  </li>
      <li>I Highly recommend this product as it is the same one my dentist charges $45 for.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product especially for the &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; taste.</li>
      <li>The fit of the InvisAlign keeps close contact between the gel and teeth unlike many crude teeth trays that you attempt to mold at home to do the same function.  </li>
      <li>As far as whitening goes, I noticed the whitening after just one overnight treatment, but had to skip the second night because of tooth sensitivity.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This NiteWhite works good. I was buying it from my dentist who was charging me quite a bit more than what I paid for it through Amazon. I will continue ordering it from Amazon. There is no difference between the quality from the dentist and the product through Amazon.</li>
    <li> As a working Dental Hygienist, I bought NiteWhite through our office for personal use.  Now retired, I&#x27;m glad to be able to still purchase it, less expensively, here.  I leave it on for 1 hour only each application.</li>
    <li> Same as my dentist but half the price and fresher.  My dentist&#x27;s stuff I think sat too long as I could never get those darn&lt;br /&gt;applicator twists off.  These twist off easily and do the job!</li>
    <li> Great stuff, works just like the ones I bought from my dentist.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have ordered this product through Amazon.  It works great and is a lot cheaper than getting it through the dentist.  There is little tooth sensitivity with this gel.  I recommend this to anyone wanting to whiten their teeth.</li>
    <li> THIS WATCH IS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT, I WISH I HAD ORDERED THE ONE I ORDERED BEFORE WITH THE LED LIGHTS THAT CIRCLE THE WATCH AND STOPS ON THE MINUTE AND SECOND, THAT WATCH I WOULD SUGGEST TO ANYONE, SINCE IVE HAD THAT ONE, IT HASNT MISSED A MINUTE OR A SECOND, I WOULD PUT IT UP AGAINST ANY WATCH I OWN AS FAR AS KEEPING TIME, IT HAS NO NUMBERS JUST LED DOTS THAT CIRCLES AND STOPS CORRECTLY ON THE TIME EVERYTIME, I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO ORDER ANOTHER ONE FOR MY DAUGHTER, THAT WATCH IS THE TALK OF MY TOWN WHO HAS SEEN IT AND I TELL THEM EXACTLY WHERE IT CAME FROM, I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO EXCHANGE, THANK YOU.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if Amazon will publish this but I hope it goes through. Just fyi, other whitening products from Smile Medic have been reported as suspicious/possibly tampered with. One woman and her husband were also reportedly taken ill after using this product. Probably just coincidence, but it might be best to buy this from someone else/your dentist.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been making a special trip to my dentist and spending much more on the same product.  This works great and with prime, it&#x27;s a click away from being delivered.  Great stuff, white teeth!</li>
    <li> Expired.Ineffective.I have been using this product for year  and have always enjoyed my pearly whites.I  bleached my teeth once a week for a month with no results.It is&lt;br /&gt;Probably expired and it was pushed any way.I work hard for everything in life and it was a total waste of money.Sad</li>
    <li> I have been whitening my teeth for a while now and used this as a touch up.  Worked great!  It has been hard to find the &#x27;real deal&#x27; on amazon, but this product/seller did the trick.  Thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> After buying the official take-home Zoom whitening kit from my local dentist, I went online to try to locate the exact product sold as refills for $60 per 3-syringe pack.  This is identical, except for having an expiration date 2 months longer than the one from the dentist.  As far as whitening goes, I noticed the whitening after just one overnight treatment, but had to skip the second night because of tooth sensitivity.  Tonight will be my 2nd application and expect even better results, along with more sensitivity that will go away after about 24 hours.  If you are looking for refills and don&#x27;t want to pay dentist-office prices, consider giving this a try.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Teeth are much whiter.</li>
    <li> Works wonderful.Received on  time.  I have tried many whitening strips and this works the best. Have trays made at your dentist and you are set.  Easy.</li>
    <li> I Highly recommend this product as it is the same one my dentist charges $45 for. The price is great. Great Seller!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this whitener and I paid more than 2x Amazon&#x27;s price at my dentists office.&lt;br /&gt;Occasionally my teeth feel a bit sensitive when I take off my whitening trays, but this goes away with 15 minutes or so.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get braces until I was 48, so I am doing everything I can to keep my teeth white and healthy,&lt;br /&gt;PLUS, I get so many compliments on how white my teeth are.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend who got it from his dentist.  It works amazingly well.</li>
    <li> The original NiteWhite I received from the dentist ran out so I found the same that I used here.  My teeth are super sensitive to the MINT and I don&#x27;t use this as often as I used the tubes the dentist originally provided me with.  However, it works.</li>
    <li> I LIKE IT BUT I DID NOT REALIZE THE AMOUNT IN THE TUBES WERE A SMALLER AMOUNT THEN I HAD PURCHASED BEFORE..BUT IT DOES A VERY GOOD JOB.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  Does the job; however, the applicator tip is very difficult to put in place and can easily cause you to spill the contents of the tube.</li>
    <li> I have used it before and I love it .</li>
    <li> Good shipping and price</li>
    <li> Good price, but not sure how effective it is.  I had to use it several nights and although my teeth are brighter, I do not think they are as white as I&#x27;d like, especially after using a full syringe.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping, item exactly as described</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected and saved a lot of money! Very happy!</li>
    <li> This gel does a much better job than the store bought whitening strips or other options I&#x27;ve tried.  I happen to be doing InvisAlign braces and using those trays in combination with this gel works exceptionally well.  The fit of the InvisAlign keeps close contact between the gel and teeth unlike many crude teeth trays that you attempt to mold at home to do the same function.  My friends easily notice the brighter smile that this product achieves where as I don&#x27;t get similar compliments from other store bought options.  I&#x27;m quite happy with this.</li>
    <li> I have had two different dental assistants tell me that the Zoom does most of it&#x27;s whittening in the first 45 min. of use.  So I just use this once or twice a day and it REALLY WORKS well.  I love not having to sleep with it all night!  I usually have sensitivity to whitteners but not this one unless I use it twice in one day.</li>
    <li> I love getting this product. It does exactly what I need to whiten my teeth as the doctor ordered. I highly recommend this product especially for the &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; taste.</li>
    <li> NiteWhite brightened my teeth without the pain of a stronger solution.  It took a few  more treatments but I didn&#x27;t have the pain I&#x27;ve had with previous whiteners.</li>
