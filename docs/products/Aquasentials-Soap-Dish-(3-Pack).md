      <li>The wood has a light lacquer of some sort on it, which is perfect as I keep my soap in the shower.</li>

      <li>They are more like soap trivets.</li>
      <li>So much better than a petrol-chemical plastic soap tray.</li>
      <li>But they do the job so thank you :]</li>
      <li>they more than do their job.  </li>
      <li>but I would pay a buck or so more for a sealer on them.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
      <li>Metal rusts this will be a more durable product.</li>

      <li>They kind of look like an elementary school art project.</li>
      <li>There was a strong smell of varnish when I took them out of the bag</li>
      <li>For a very reasonable price, you quickly recieve a set of fairly well made light soap dishes.</li>
      <li>and it is good as new.</li>
      <li>They work just fine.</li>
      <li>These work fine.  </li>
      <li>These little soap &amp;#34;dishes&amp;#34; are the best.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These little soap savers are perfect for the shampoo bars.</li>
      <li>These are wonderful little soap dishes.  </li>
      <li>I had multiple Christmas gifts of soap with a dish and this worked out great.</li>
      <li>The price is also fantastic.</li>
      <li>Really cheaply made, sturdy</li>
      <li>I hope they become available again soon.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had mine for years now and they&#x27;re still in the same great condition as the day I got them.</li>
      <li>Appreciate the detailed description.</li>
      <li>price is perfect, shipping was fast, item looks elegantly simple if you like bamboo and simplicity.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still using some from my original order (well over a year) without issue.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;-easy to rinse and clean off the soap build up&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also like the clean design lines.  </li>
      <li>They are simple, well constructed, and do a good job letting air circulate on the bottom of my soaps</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a lot better then buying a $20.00 dollar one that&#x27;s really fancy.</li>
      <li>They do the job just as I hoped and they actually look really good.</li>
      <li>Good thing, because two out of the three that arrived had crooked slats.</li>
      <li>Positive, easy transaction.</li>
      <li>These bamboo soap holders are pretty straightforward, but they are also pretty cheap.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re adequate, but definitely not fancy or nice.  </li>
      <li>I make my own soap and it is important for it to dry in between using and this dish does the job.  </li>
      <li>These little bits of wood are a great help in drying the soap you bathe with or use at your sink.</li>
      <li>These little soap trays are perfect for our natural decorating style.</li>
      <li>These are very simple soap dishes and serve their purpose - nice and neat.  </li>
      <li>But it is easy to clean and reuse if you want to be environmentally conscious and conservative.  </li>
      <li>Love these, so far they are holding up well</li>
      <li>It comes in a 3-pk and quite economical as well.</li>
      <li>The quality was worth $2.</li>
      <li>I would say that the quality is by far greater than what I paid for them.  </li>
      <li>Surprisingly, they&#x27;re not only cute in their minimal appearance, but also quite functional.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>These work OK for holding my sponge, and little bottle of dishsoap, but for bar soap I would prefer something more self contained.</li>
      <li>If the manufacturer would take the further step to wipe the excess glue, they could charge $1 more and it would be worth it.</li>
      <li>I make my own bar soap from scratch and wanted something that would allow it to dry when not in use and these get the job done</li>
      <li>Perfectly fine in their own right, but unfortunately they mold so quickly and easily.</li>
      <li>They are very very lightweight, so tend to move around when you touch them.</li>
      <li>In order to avoid this, I coated these in food grade mineral oil before the first use.</li>
      <li>(only been three months, however) and I would order more.  </li>
      <li>I appreciate simple elegant design.  </li>
      <li>You can see the hot glue that holds them together but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
      <li>These are exactly as described.</li>
      <li>(however the measures are available and I did not check it completely).</li>
      <li>I would definitely order more.</li>
      <li>They do the job I got them for much more affordably than other options I saw, and so far have held up relatively okay for some months.  </li>
      <li>These are cute little soap trays but they are cheaply made.</li>
      <li>They keep my soap from sitting in water in the shower and have a clean, natural look.  </li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t perfect in construction, the rows are a little uneven and glue can be seen at some joints.</li>
      <li>Some of the slats aren&#x27;t straight, but that doesn&#x27;t render the product defective.  </li>
      <li>and I think one had a stick that wasn&#x27;t straight.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>but i had another set that the bars across the soap dish were much wider and prefer that one over this one.&lt;br /&gt;one of them was cracked when i got it..</li>
      <li>I also like that they aren&#x27;t as cheap looking as plastic soap dishes, but they&#x27;re not breakable in the same way ceramic ones are.</li>
      <li>they keep the bar soap from disintegrating too fast.</li>
      <li>Neutral to any decor, but really reminds me of a spa or beach vacation cottage.</li>
      <li>There is nothing unusual to report.  </li>
      <li>They were cheap and serve their purpose, but I won&#x27;t order this particular item once these get too gross for use.</li>
      <li>These would be better used for craft projects or dry decorative soap displays, not real everyday soap use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is just what i was looking for.  They are inexpensive and look good.  They do what they are supposed to!</li>
    <li> These are a nice product for the price.  They keep my soap from sitting in water in the shower and have a clean, natural look.  There was a strong smell of varnish when I took them out of the bag but that went away after a day.</li>
    <li> These little bits of wood are a great help in drying the soap you bathe with or use at your sink.</li>
    <li> Two stars means &#x27;I don&#x27;t like It&#x27;, but that&#x27;s a bit harsh. I do like these little soap holders but they have some drawbacks. They are very very lightweight, so tend to move around when you touch them. They aren&#x27;t perfect in construction, the rows are a little uneven and glue can be seen at some joints. They kind of look like an elementary school art project. (Geez, I hope they weren&#x27;t made by prisoners) Anyway I can live with all of that, the biggest issue is there&#x27;s no polyurethane on the wood to protect it from soap stains. Three holders for the price is great but I would pay a buck or so more for a sealer on them.&lt;br /&gt;Plus ultimately I don&#x27;t like the water and soap just dripping onto my counter. I may as well just put the soap directly on the counter. These work OK for holding my sponge, and little bottle of dishsoap, but for bar soap I would prefer something more self contained.</li>
    <li> Really cheaply made, sturdy but there&#x27;s splinters and stuff... but it&#x27;s a lot better then buying a $20.00 dollar one that&#x27;s really fancy. But they do the job so thank you :]</li>
    <li> These are wonderful little soap dishes.  I make my own soap and it is important for it to dry in between using and this dish does the job.  They are not top notch quality but for the price they more than do their job.  I would say that the quality is by far greater than what I paid for them.  So I am happy.</li>
    <li> These are perfect! Just what I was looking for and the price is awesome!  I make my own bar soap from scratch and wanted something that would allow it to dry when not in use and these get the job done and they&#x27;re cute!</li>
    <li> I use this to place my Lola wooden nail brush on.  I have one in the kitchen &amp; one by the bathroom sink.</li>
    <li> price is perfect, shipping was fast, item looks elegantly simple if you like bamboo and simplicity. Great for travel. Lightweight. It is cheap enough to throw out and replace when it gets soap scum (like all soap dishes do) But it is easy to clean and reuse if you want to be environmentally conscious and conservative.  I use a scrub brush and just brush the soap flakes out and it is good as new. It never gets mildew.</li>
    <li> I have used this seller in the past for this exact item and would do so again.  These are very simple soap dishes and serve their purpose - nice and neat.  I have read reviews about mold being an issue but that has not been my experience.  I keep mine in a well ventilated location and that may be the difference.  I also take a brush (or my fingernail, depending on how lazy I feel) and scrub off the dried on soap - easy task - plop the soap back on the dish and that&#x27;s it. Although these look like they might fall apart, they don&#x27;t and each one is used regularly.  I&#x27;m still using some from my original order (well over a year) without issue.  Positive, easy transaction. Item is well-packaged and arrived per description.  I will use this seller again.</li>
    <li> Got these soap dishes and they were what I expected. Size works great for the niche.  They are somewhat protected so they aren&#x27;t getting pounded with water.  They are serving the purpose which was to keep the soap from sliding out of the niche. Since the tile at the base is slightly angled to keep the water from accumulating, the soap kept sliding out. Now it stays in place.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a simple wood soap dish that wouldn&#x27;t break the bank and I ordered these because the price for the 3-pack was about equal that of one of other similar products. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but was actually pleasantly surprised when I received the soap dishes. They are very simple - just a few wooden slats glued to one another - but the minimalistic look is pretty nice. The wood has a light lacquer of some sort on it, which is perfect as I keep my soap in the shower. I even held it under water just to test the efficacy of the lacquer: the wood still looks perfect and the glue is holding just fine.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave it only four stars is that on two of my dishes the slats aren&#x27;t aligned quite right and are somewhat crooked. This doesn&#x27;t change the functionality of the soap dish at all, but it distracts from the aesthetics, especially if you are OCD like me.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these are pretty nice soap dishes, especially if you are looking for wood or ones that can survive a shower environment, and you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price.</li>
    <li> These work great, I make handmade soap and included a &amp;#34; soap drain&amp;#34; with the bar as gifts. This is a must have.</li>
    <li> These are what the doctor ordered.  Buy them as stocking stuffers, I don&#x27;t think I would go back to anything else.</li>
    <li> A three pack for less than five bucks!  I have them our bathrooms now ans they keep the bar soap from disintegrating too fast.</li>
    <li> I appreciate simple elegant design.  This back to basics product is well made.  So much better than a petrol-chemical plastic soap tray.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call these soap dishes. They are more like soap trivets. They are perfect for my square Chanel No. 5 bar soap and for my husband&#x27;s favorite bar soap, too. No soggy soap for him, nice looking resting place for my Chanel. Yay!  Neutral to any decor, but really reminds me of a spa or beach vacation cottage. No need for Calgon to take me away. These will do nicely.</li>
    <li> they work  but i had another set that the bars across the soap dish were much wider and prefer that one over this one.&lt;br /&gt;one of them was cracked when i got it.. and now it has broken.</li>
    <li> Great..I put one in each bathroom and use 2 in the kitchen for the pad and sponge. I like them cuz it helps dry and not create mold.</li>
    <li> Some of the slats aren&#x27;t straight, but that doesn&#x27;t render the product defective.  For 5 dollars I can tolerate the imperfection.</li>
    <li> They work just fine. Not sure how long they will last, but exactly what I expected. Bought as replacements for some that were several years old and coming apart.</li>
    <li> These are OK but poorly made. What would you expect at this price tho? Had several come apart because they are not glued together well and others that are put together sloppily and out of line. We resell them and people seem to like the them so will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> they are so fashionable and hold any type of soap. we use in the shower, but could be cute as a functional decorative piece for your sink. I would definitely order more.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly, they&#x27;re not only cute in their minimal appearance, but also quite functional.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the asian look soap dish.  It comes in a 3-pk and quite economical as well.</li>
    <li> We received what we expected with this purchase. Appreciate the detailed description. There is nothing unusual to report.  Would buy again if needed.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and was as expected.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Smaller than what it looks (however the measures are available and I did not check it completely).</li>
    <li> They work! You can see the hot glue that holds them together but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Excellent soap dishes. They drain well and are a good size for my Cetaphyl soap.  The price is also fantastic.</li>
    <li> Love these, so far they are holding up well (only been three months, however) and I would order more.  Seem to be well made.</li>
    <li> I make homemade soap and wanted something to give away with my soaps as Christmas gifts in 2012. These are inexpensive and work great.</li>
    <li> Pack of 3 worked out great for me. I put soap in the shower on one, sponge in kitchen on another and the 3rd I gave to my daughter for her sponge. The sponge has a place to go where it can dray out and not grow bacteria. Simpile and inexpensive solution.</li>
    <li> These work fine.  They&#x27;re adequate, but definitely not fancy or nice.  I think one of them is already splitting a little bit, and may even have arrived that way, but I paid so little that I didn&#x27;t really care.  They do the job I got them for much more affordably than other options I saw, and so far have held up relatively okay for some months.  I also like that they aren&#x27;t as cheap looking as plastic soap dishes, but they&#x27;re not breakable in the same way ceramic ones are.</li>
    <li> If you use shampoo bars this is a must! I&#x27;ve always had dandruff and no matter what I&#x27;d try it never went away. Dandruff shampoos only made it worse and I didn&#x27;t know what to do. I happened upon some natural, organic shampoo bars on amazon and discovered that my scalp was just chemical sensitive. However, like soap bars, shampoo bars will dissolve and not last very long if they set in water after you use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These little soap savers are perfect for the shampoo bars. Since they&#x27;re made of wood, they naturally pull out some of the moisture and they also allow the bars to dry faster. Since they come in a pack of 3 you can have some different types of bars to use to mix things up. I&#x27;d definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> It holds my soap and doesn&#x27;t slide away.  I hated when the soap dish got filled with water so these are a nice alternative.  You have to wipe up underneath every once in awhile, but I prefer that to a soapy mess in the dish.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with these, they are working well and were very economical. I use one in my shower cubby and one on my tub area.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints about this product, you simply get what you pay for. For a very reasonable price, you quickly recieve a set of fairly well made light soap dishes. Basically the product is a set of thick wooden dowels glued into end pieces. The size is perfect, if the glue was not so obvious I woukd have given this product full rating. If the manufacturer would take the further step to wipe the excess glue, they could charge $1 more and it would be worth it.</li>
    <li> They are cute and serve their purpose. Soap does get into and through the cracks, creating a little mess underneath.</li>
    <li> These bamboo soap holders are pretty straightforward, but they are also pretty cheap. I bought them to use as sponge rests next to our kitchen sink, so I wasn&#x27;t so concerned with the aesthetics. Good thing, because two out of the three that arrived had crooked slats. Also, you can see the glue everywhere on this thing. I know other reviewers complained about mold, and that&#x27;s a common concern with wooden items that come into contact with water. In order to avoid this, I coated these in food grade mineral oil before the first use. This is the same way you seal wooden cutting boards. It seems to be doing the trick. After several weeks of holding a wet sponge, there&#x27;s not a hint of mold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a cost effective soap dish, these are a good option, just don&#x27;t expect them to all look perfect when they arrive.</li>
    <li> These were great for the price. I bought six and I think one had a stick that wasn&#x27;t straight. You can see the glue if you look up close. The quality was worth $2. I had multiple Christmas gifts of soap with a dish and this worked out great.</li>
    <li> These are exactly as described. Not super robust but they&#x27;ve held up and look very attractive. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> These are well made minimalist gems at an unbelievable price. After about 3 months of use they are like new.</li>
    <li> These little soap &amp;#34;dishes&amp;#34; are the best. They are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;-impervious to water and soap so they don&#x27;t rot or harbor mildew&lt;br /&gt;-unobtrusive and won&#x27;t clash with other design motifs&lt;br /&gt;-easy to rinse and clean off the soap build up&lt;br /&gt;-raised and slatted so the soap dries completely, conserving bar soap while preventing melting&lt;br /&gt;-unbreakable if dropped or knocked off a counter top&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t warp or degrade over time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had mine for years now and they&#x27;re still in the same great condition as the day I got them. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I buy natural soap that dissolves fast so if I keep it on these, it dries instead of melts and then the soap lasts longer. For the price, these are awesome.</li>
    <li> These dishes were a little smaller than what I anticipated and not sealed very well, so they have already started to discolor from soap/water. They were cheap and serve their purpose, but I won&#x27;t order this particular item once these get too gross for use.</li>
    <li> These are cute little soap trays but they are cheaply made. The slats are hot glued on crooked and the wood is not sealed. So if you put wet soap on these eventually you will have a mold problem. These would be better used for craft projects or dry decorative soap displays, not real everyday soap use.</li>
    <li> I bought these to keep our soap from slipping off its built-in ledge and to keep the shaving cream can from rusting on the marble. They do the job just as I hoped and they actually look really good. Can&#x27;t beat the price. I&#x27;d buy them again. They don&#x27;t appear to have any sort of protectant on them, but they haven&#x27;t mildewed yet. Have had them about 6 months.</li>
    <li> This is just what I was hoping for.  Metal rusts this will be a more durable product. The surprise was finding 3 in the package.  I thought I only getting one. Perfect</li>
    <li> very nice soap dish for the price</li>
    <li> I bought these to go along with some homemade soap I made for gifts - they were perfect and have held up nicely.  Great value too.</li>
    <li> These little soap trays are perfect for our natural decorating style. The soap dries well and I&#x27;ve never had any mess beneath them.</li>
    <li> They are simple, well constructed, and do a good job letting air circulate on the bottom of my soaps so they dry out completely after use, stay solid, and last much longer.  I also like the clean design lines.  I hope they become available again soon.</li>
    <li> Perfectly fine in their own right, but unfortunately they mold so quickly and easily. Ugh! I&#x27;d recommend something sealed or maybe higher quality in general.</li>
