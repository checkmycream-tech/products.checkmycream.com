<li> Dickinson&#x27;s has been around for a long time, I remember my mother using when I was a child.</li>
<li> Now because of age I also have dry skin.</li>
<li> When I brought it on a trip with my family to Europe the toner had a tendency to leak out of the container due to a problem with the tightness of the cap, and I had to wrap the entire product in a bag to prevent any liquids from getting anything else in my suitcase wet.</li>
<li> So without the seal, the container will likely leak if tipped upside down for awhile or when brought for traveling purposes.</li>
<li> /&gt;The smell is a little off putting for me, but I have learned to get used to it</li>
<li> I use this everyday</li>
<li> Also the container for this toner is not very good.</li>
<li> I have a hard time finding a toner because others often leave behind some icky feeling on my skin.  </li>
<li> The person who said it smells like bacon is wrong - I wouldn&#x27;t eat bacon that smelled like that!</li>
<li> Life changing if you have bad skin like I do</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have tried other toners and Ike this product the best. You skin feels so smooth and soft and not dry. I  recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a good astringent solution. It reduces the oil on my T-zone which is the more oily part of my face. It also reduces the redness that appears on my face after washing or cleaning it with facial soap or cleaning agents.</li>
    <li> product is as described</li>
    <li> Life changing if you have bad skin like I do</li>
    <li> Very nice &amp; clean feel, after using these wipes. And they&#x27;re not skimpy on the amount of witch hazel put into each wipe. I use them during the day for my oily face &amp; don&#x27;t have to apply lotion afterwards. Also good for after exercising. You&#x27;ll feel like you&#x27;ve washed your face!</li>
    <li> Good price. I use this everyday so it was a great value!</li>
    <li> Old fashioned maybe, but it&#x27;s a wonderful natural product for facial cleaning.</li>
    <li> This s*** is great... toner and don&#x27;t burn!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  The Witch Hazel is a wonderful toner for my skin.  I have a hard time finding a toner because others often leave behind some icky feeling on my skin.  This toner always does a good job removing dirt and makeup as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a little off putting for me, but I have learned to get used to it and it no longer bothers me anymore.  I feel like that is just based on preference because I have had friends who like the smell.</li>

    <li> nice package of witch hazel.  I use it as an antiseptic and cleaner for several things.  I can put a bottle here and there with this pack.</li>
    <li> love this product! I use it as an astringent, cleanser, and as a refreshing face/body spritzer in the hot weather! The seller sent the product quickly and well packaged...will continue to purchase from this seller.</li>
    <li> Really takes off anything extra thats on your face theres no strong smell love the feel after</li>
    <li> This pore perfecting toner works wonders.  It leaves my skin so soft and wonderful...  I use the Neytrogena pore refining Daily Cleanser first.  I would highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I just started using this and already my skin is clearer! I am in my 50&#x27;s, and have struggled with breakouts off &amp; on for years. Now because of age I also have dry skin. This is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin. As for the smell, it ia awful!&lt;br /&gt;But let&#x27;s face it, the reason it doesn&#x27;t smell pretty is because it&#x27;s ALL NATURAL! It doesn&#x27;t have perfumes or dyes, so it is much better for your skin. The person who said it smells like bacon is wrong - I wouldn&#x27;t eat bacon that smelled like that! It doesn&#x27;t smell near as good as bacon!</li>
