    <li> favorite product to give my thin hair some height and volume.</li>
    <li> I use it at the roots when I&#x27;m blow-drying my hair.  I have wacky hair.  It&#x27;s very fine but has uneven curls and can lay flat on top which is not attractive.  This product helps to give it lift and life!</li>

    <li> I have very fine blonde hair and this is the only spray on the market that works! I&#x27;ve tried every brand and always seem to come back to Paul Mitchell. I&#x27;ve used it for 10 yrs. and will continue to do so unless they stop making it - then a new search will be on.</li>
    <li> having been using this product for seven or better yrs.  there is no other product that comes close to this one.</li>

    <li> Fast service. The Paul Mitchell Volumizer  works very well with limp hair. It is not sticky and holds the volume even during wet weather. I have used this product for several years. It is unscented and reliable. Amazon is a great way to find this product because it is not available at my supermarket and saves me an additional trip.</li>
    <li> Gives my hair good volume, doesnt feel greasy the next day at the root.</li>
    <li> I do not like it.  I like the Clean Spray, and thought that this would be like it.  My mistake.  May I return the unopened ones?</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t do without this product. Been using this for the last 5 years. I purchase 3-4 bottles a year</li>
