<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The flat iron is just like any other with the exception that it will not last as long. I was only able to use mine 2 times! before it stopped working. Try a sedu I&#x27;ve had that one for almost 5 years now and it is still functioning perfectly.</li>
    <li> Have tried several irons in the past, and just love this one the best. Heats up real fast! Like the salon! You don&#x27;t have to fill the barrel every single time. Hair looks great!</li>
    <li> First of all, I LOVE THIS PRODUCT when it doesn&#x27;t make my bathroom look like the 4th of July! It really is an amazing straightener and I have impossible hair but I have now had 2 in 2 months. Both of which have now shot sparks out of them. I am very bummed but I&#x27;m going to have to go back to my GHD. I really wanted this product to work but I was actually scared to plug the 2nd one in sometimes and this morning.... BOOM! Fireworks again! Please fix this and I would love to buy another!</li>
    <li> Works well excellent CD gives tips on best use techniques. Easy to use. Does not seem to damage hair. So far not problems with cord as reported by others.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy mine on Amazon I got mine at the salon but I like to leave reviews so others will know. Its really great, I personally love the CHI but this one is really just as good. Especially if you have ethnic or curly hair. I haven&#x27;t had any of the shorting out like some of the other people, the one I have is a newer model so hopefully they worked out the kinks. Its certainly a high end professional flat iron and gives my hair a lasting silky bounce. I don&#x27;t know if that serum makes your hair healthy, all heat typically destroys hair so I would not buy this if you are getting it cause it will make your hair healthy. Once you hair is dead..its dead. You basically have to start over from the new hair growth and cut the dead ends. That is the only way for healthy hair and use a heat guard serum to keep from further damage. Anyways I give this Flat Iron 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Like many others here said, the results are great but no iron this expensive should break so easily.  I never have it on for more than 15 minutes a shot because I have very fine hair so it doesn&#x27;t take long to straighten yet today it popped and died.  If they could fix that glitch I would happily buy another one but in the meantime, I think I&#x27;ll give Chi a try.</li>
    <li> i bought this two months ago and it sucks. i fill the chamber with fluid and as soon as i&#x27;m done its gone. It leaks the fluid too. It is more damaging to my hair. Save your money and buy something better i was completely disappointed with this flat iorn!</li>
    <li> I bought this from my hairdresser which is lucky for me because the first one popped, sizzled and shorted out after 6 weeks.  The replacement did the same after 6 weeks. My hairdresser always replaces them for me.  I would not buy this from anywhere but a licensed professional who can help with replacements.  It has saved my damaged hair and I love the way my hair looks and feels. If that were not the case, I would never keep replacing it.  For 100+ it should not short out.  The cheap ones I bought from Sally&#x27;s or Walmart never broke, but of course never made my hair look all that great.  Buyer beware that there is a serious flaw in the design since the vapor can short out the circuits.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is great for damaged/dry hair. It is better than the Chi, which I used for years before finding this one. My stylist recommended  it because of the serum it puts on the hair as you straighten, it makes the hair super smooth and shiny. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> It is awesome!  In regards to it shorting out or leaking, the first batch of these new irons had some problems.  Now they have been worked out and no one should be nervous to buy this iron.  I have been using mine for almost a year and I flat iron every day.  My hair used to dry out and split easily, now it barely splits and it feels softer. I love this vapor iron!!!!  :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron (not from this company) in July as it was recommended by my stylist.  I have only used it about 4 times.  On the morning of 9/30/2010 I decided to use it again.  Before turning on, I raised the temperature slightly.  The flat iron was on for about 30 seconds, and then, thank goodness I wasn&#x27;t holding it, because there was a FLASH and a *POP* and that was the end of $150 flat iron.  \\&quot;Something\\&quot; has short-circuited.      In reading the warranty material, Joico does give a limited 12-month warranty on this product, HOWEVER, in order to get it repaired and returned to you, you have to pay them $15 for shipping and handling.  EXCUSE ME?      As for my stylist, well, she used hers continuously for 2 weeks and then the on/off switch stopped working.  I suspect the same thing happened to hers as mine.  The company she purchased it from gave her an immediate replacement.  I have sent the company I purchased the iron from, an email, but as of this writing, they have yet to respond.</li>
    <li> I really did like this iron but am on my second one already.  I bought an iron 6 weeks ago, and this morning I heard a pop and saw a spark burst out from inside the iron, and now it doesn&#x27;t turn on any more. It wasn&#x27;t in my hand at the time, because I feel that could have been pretty dangerous.      I read the reviews and it seems that Joico isn&#x27;t quick about replacing the defective products.  I will be searching for another flat iron :(     Any suggestions :(</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t figure out how people could find fault with this iron, unless they got a faulty unit.  Mine is flawless and so is my hair.  I live in Oregon where the humidity is a nightmare for anyone with frizzy hair and natural curl.  I would look out the window in the morning and decide it wasn&#x27;t worth using my old flat iron if it was raining at all, which is most of the time.  No more - this flat iron can take the moisture no problem.  My stylist used it on me after a hair cut and I was hooked, picked one up right away.  I have since hooked my mom and three other friends.    It does run through the fuel pretty fast, but I could not possibly care less.  It&#x27;s worth every cent.</li>
    <li> I have just bought my second Vapor Iron because the first has been leaking vapor fuel for a year now.  I had called Joico and emailed them and they had sent me 3 or 4 new resevoirs to try and the iron still leaks.  I tried this &#x27;new&#x27; iron this morning for the first time and was very disappointed to see the vapor fuel leaking all over my hand again.  I will be returning this new iron.  I&#x27;ve written to Joico about my old Iron and have asked them to help fix it and they do not respond.  Very disappointed in the Iron and in Joico.  :(&lt;br /&gt;Also a side note.  The iron doesn&#x27;t really seem to condition my hair.  My hair seems more split and dry the more I use the iron.&lt;br /&gt;*Udpate.  It is now 6-12-12 and I have been notified I am receiving a refund check for the vapor iron from Joico.  To date I have went thru 4 or 5 irons.  3 of them have seriously sparked fireworks at me!  once while I had the straightner up to my hair, I am lucky my hair didn&#x27;t burn!  This iron is dangerous and not worth the hassle.  The only thing that is decent is Joico&#x27;s customer service salon.  They were helpful with getting me new irons when mine kept burning out and also with this refund.</li>
    <li> I have a love/hate relationship with this product.  It works beautifully on my hair and creates a silky, frizz-free, healthy looking style.  I find it to be easy to handle and very hydrating.  However, my first iron shorted out after only three months of use, three days per week.  I have shoulder length, fine hair and it only takes me 10 minutes to complete my style.  I do not feel that a product which cost me $130 should break with such limited use.  Luckily, my hairdresser replaced my broken one free of charge.  However, I am nervous every time I plug it in that it is going to break again.  I have written to Joico about this and am hoping that they work out the kinks AND reconsider their repair charge for this item.</li>
    <li> flat iron leaks every where, huge mess.  contacted manufacturer, told me to try cleaning it, why not sure it was only 2 weeks old.  would cost me 14.95 to send to manufacturer - would never buy or recommend this product to anyone.  wanted to exchange it for, perhaps one that didn&#x27;t leak, but was out of stock.  ended up keeping it and just not using the liquid stuff....now have sedu iron, and i love it.</li>
    <li> This iron is THE BEST flat iron on the market....it doesn&#x27;t get any better than this one!  Don&#x27;t waste you time or money on any other iron.  I&#x27;m a hair stylist and I&#x27;ve used a lot of irons, NOT ONE compares to this one!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a stylist and I loved this straightener when I first got it except now I have went through three of them. They just quit working. The first two that I had both stopped working within two months, and the third one has been having issues turning on for the last couple months. The warranty is only good for a year so be careful, mine just went over the warranty by a few days and they said they wouldn&#x27;t be able to do anything with it. So be careful, its a great straightener when it works but I have mixed feelings because they are so faulty. I would probably recommend getting a GHD or CHI iron, they are a little more expensive but at least they are quality and will last.</li>
    <li> At first the Joico Reconstrx Vapor Iron was great, but after I had it for about 3 weeks it sparked and then completely quit working.  I&#x27;m attempting to send it back to Joico but they need proof of purchase and I didn&#x27;t get a receipt from the Amazon dealer I purchased it from.</li>
    <li> I would be hesitant to buy this product or from seller. I purchased this item in pink for a gift and it shorted out after about 3 uses. I would agree to buy one from your hair stylist. What happened to me is it&#x27;s 2/6/12 and I&#x27;m still waiting for a refund for this product purchased in December! Seller said they would replace or refund. I opted for the replacement and when I mailed the defective iron back with a USP tracking number, I got email from seller that they closed my purchase as no return. I tried to call the sellers phone number but I got a message that the number was changed or it was disconnected. So last week I got an email from seller that the pink iron is no longer offered and that I would get a refund for this iron (that was a Christmas gift) and still no refund. What a run around! I would consider purchasing this else where as difficulty with the transaction and then the iron did not work very long at all. It sparked and then shorted out and would not heat anymore. If you want it, try to get from a local salon where they can work with you.</li>
    <li> I loved the iron... used it everyday for about 6 weeks and then sizzle!!! It shorted out and now I have frizz again and an expensive bottle of replacement vapor fluid!&lt;br /&gt;I dont know if I will buy another one after reading all of the reviews that say it will happen again!!! disappointing, because I finally had something that worked and didn&#x27;t break my hair!</li>
    <li> I bought this iron after a long time of contimplating about spending this much money for a flat iron. My hairstylist uses this iron and recommended it to me. So, after much deliberation, I bought it.I read the reviews prior, and most were not good, but I figured if my stylist uses it it could not be too bad.I used the iron about three times, then each time I used it after that, the conditioner would leak out of the holder (just as the reviews said! I flat iron my hair daily, so the idea of putting a conditioner into my hair at the same time appeals to me.With some modifications to the iron to prevent it from leaking, Joico would have a fabulous product.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, dry, frizzy, kinky hard to manage long hair. I bought the iron, the shampoo, conditioner and hair balm in a kit.  I also use the vapor fuel in the iron which came with the kit as well.  My hair now looks and feels like normal hair.  I have never purchased any product that came close to this.  I have had many flat irons, all prices and makes.  This product almost works like spray starch works on a wrinkled shirt.  No burning smell or broken hair.  My hair feels soft and looks shiny and healthy.  You can use it to curl your hair or straighten it.  If you have difficult hair, buy this and be done with it.  It is absolutely the best product on the market.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was told it was one of the best flat irons for coarse thick hair (which I have).  I hated that it took the reconstruct serum.  However, it did straighten my hair nicely.  Then 1 month after purchasing, the flat iron, while in use, sparked (actual fire spark) and died.  I sent it back to Joico, asking for a full refund.  They refused because it wasn&#x27;t in the original box (which I had thrown away).  Joico sent me a new one and 4 months later, it sparked again and died.  I will never buy any Joico product again.  This flat iron is DANGEROUS.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this flat iron!!this is by far the best flat iron I have ever had!!I will def plan on keeping this one for a long time!I love how soft and healthy it makes my hair look and feel!I would def recommend this iron if you have fine/damaged hair as it def makes a difference!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in July of this year. I have used it only about 6 times. Last month (9/1/2010), about 30 seconds after turning the unit on, there was a *POP* and that was the end of this very expensive flat iron.     Joico has a 12-month limited warranty, but in order to have it repaired and returned to you they want $[...] for shipping and handling. As I live in Brazil, there&#x27;s no way to have it fixed cause, even if I send it to US, Joico can&#x27;t send it back to me .     I&#x27;m really sad, cause it is a very good iron, BUT, it&#x27;s very expensive and I use it only 6 times until it stopped working. Reading other reviews, I realized it is a common problem and many people are not satisfied. I wrote Joico an e-mail to try to solve this problem and I&#x27;m still waiting for an answer...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews because I have had the kpak iron for 6 months and it works great. I get compliments on how my hair looks now when before I didn&#x27;t. The shine is incredible.It took a few times using it to get used to it, but now I wouldn&#x27;t use any other flat iron. Thanks Joico!</li>
    <li> I bought this from another website but I had to add my two cents worth. So far so good. I have had it from 7 to 6 months with no problems. I use the vapor button and other times I do not. It works great my hair is smooth, shinny and soft. I take exceptional care of my hair and the last thing I want is for it to be burnt to badly. I have curly fine hair that I straighten everyday on a low heat of 280. I use a flat iron comb [...]- and it works wonders. I used to use Hai and the highly toughed Sedu and this is the best ever for me. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Purchased last year and within 6 months iron went completely DEAD.  Got Replacement from the vendor and now its 6 months again and its completely DEAD.  Not happy got in touch with Joico and they will either replace or refund.  I want a refund, i think 2 trys is enough.</li>
    <li> This is the best straightner they have evermade.. My daughter is a hair stylist and they use these straightners in their shop.. It is the best.. It not only straightens your hair it does condition it. I no longer have frizee ends..This item was less expensive at Amazon, than what my daughter could buy it at her cost at a beauty shop wholesaler.</li>
    <li> I WOULD RATE 0 STARS IF I COULD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;let me say i did not purchase my iron from amazon, but i purchased it from a salon and have had it replaced once and only once because i decided i was not going to send it back agian!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the first time it went out i was not around to see the \\&quot;spark\\&quot; but noticed that it was leaking through the handle and my hair was not soft after running the iron through, on top of the fuel being HOT and it actually burning me due to the leak. so i contacted joico and sent it back, the customer service was actually really nice and they voided the shipping fee back to me, although i still had to pay to ship it to them. when i got my replacement i was stoked, i couldnt wait to use it again. not even a weeks worth of usuage, it shorted out again. this time i actually SAW the spark and heard the pop and when i went to put it on my hair, sure enough there was hot fuel leaking from the handle. needless to say, i was pissed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am returning this iron back to the salon and ordering me another brand. this was recommended by my hair styliest and even she has one, and she has had the same problems with it. i&#x27;m telling you do not waste your money!!!</li>
    <li> best hot iron ever!! leaves your hair very soft and silky. i purchased it for my daughter who has very thick hair and it works very quick. reheats very quick</li>
    <li> This iron actually improves the look, texture, radiance and feel of my fine thin blonde hair. The conditioner that goes inside infuses my hair making it look not only as straight as I wanted it but also visually silkier and soft to the touch.  At long last I&#x27;ve found the best! A friend of mine worked in a salon &amp; she has family who own some - she said to me she&#x27;d never use anything else &amp; now I see why.&lt;br /&gt;Transaction was swift, package arrived undamaged &amp; on time.  Highly recommend this purchase on all levels.  Worth the investment in my opinion. Thanks!</li>
    <li> The first time I used this iron I already had high expectations. I read a few rave reviews, and as an early birthday gift to myself I bought it. After doing a very deep conditioning treatment, I blew dry my hair, and wrapped it up over night.     The next morning I filled the little reservoir with the Vapor Fuel, and began to flat iron. I immediately saw incredible sheen, and felt amazing softness in my hair. There was a very minimal amount of steam emitted, but once I was done with my whole head, only 1/4 of the liquid was left. There wasn&#x27;t even that \\&quot;burnt\\&quot; smell flat ironing can some times leave.     My hair stayed moist, shiny, and felt strong until my next wash. Usually, my hair begins to look and feel dull after a couple of days.     This flat iron made my hair products work the inside out as well. They penetrated deep, and were sealed in because of the steam used. I think I can count on one hand how may broken hairs I had the whole week.     This is the best hair appliance that I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ll never give it up!</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended this flat iron to me and I absolutely love it!!  I have been using it for about a week now and my hair has never felt more healthy.  It is expensive, but worth it.  I have fine hair that has been breaking off lately.  I worry about damaging my hair with a flat iron, but this one has actually improved my hair.  It feels so soft and healthy now.</li>
    <li> This was the BEST straightener I&#x27;ve ever used. My hair looked awesome, and felt smooth and silky. Everything was great . . . that is until it sparked and shorted out on me this morning after only one week! Yes readers, that&#x27;s right. One week. I remember reading the reviews when I bought it that warned me against just such a thing, but I thought \\&quot;Surely these people are doing something wrong. It won&#x27;t happen to me.\\&quot; And I shelled out some serious dough anyways. BIG MISTAKE! There is no product warranty, but if you ship it to the company in California (at your own expense) and pay for the return shipping of $15, they will supposedly fix it or send you a new one. Of course, that&#x27;s another $30 bucks I would have to sink into this thing, and the same thing would probably happen again, as it has for most other reviewers who have returned them only to be disappointed again. Considered yourself warned.</li>
    <li> This is the first of two Vapor irons I bought.  The first iron stopped working 8 months after I bought it.  There is no reason as to why it stopped working it just wouldn&#x27;t turn on one morning.  It was completely dead.  I figured it was just a dud and bought another (not from the same vendor) and that one died just like the first one.  Neither iron got wet, was dropped or mishandled in anyway.  They simply stopped working one morning.  I used my flat irons about 2 - 3 times a week depending on how much time I had in the morning.  During the summers I used them less frequently because I would let my hair air dry on the way to work.  I do not recommend this t anyone.  Such a disappointment.  Also, I have a travel flat iron that I paid $20 for at a drug store over 3 years ago, it still works and doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out like this iron did.  The Joico iron was less drying when I used it without the vapor - but something in the vapor is drying and dulling to hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this hot iron from my hair stylist, she highly recommended it because I have wavy, frizzy, thick hair and I constantly hot iron and chemically straighten and relax my hair. At first I was skeptical, because I already had a pretty decent ceramic hot iron that cost me less than $50. However, I had gone through about three $20 hot irons and my $50 was on its way out- so I figured I would give this pricey one a shot and I am so glad I did! I have had the same one about 3 years and I absolutely love it. The first time I used it, I could instantly tell why it was worth the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main thing that sets this hot iron aside from the rest is the fact that it uses Vapor Fuel. I has a little compartment that you fill with Vapor Fuel with that is loaded with great stuff: Their patented \\&quot;Quadramine Complex\\&quot; that is supposed to reconstruct and protect your hair; antioxidants that also protect hair- particularly against damaging free radicals in the environment; essential fatty acids which are always great for shine, flexibility and manageability and softness; botanical moisturizers also for moisture and softness; and \\&quot;featherweight silicones,\\&quot; which are the key to frizz elimination. From the very first time I used this hot iron, to today 3 years later I still see incredible sheen, and feel amazing softness of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to mention is that quite a bit of steam is emitted from this device. Sometimes when people see me using it, they think I am burning my hair! I just have t reassure them, and myself, that it is just the goodness of the Reconstrx Vapor. Another thing to mention is that, for me anyways, by the time I am done straightening all of my hair,  all of liquid had run out. I do have rather long hair, below my shoulders, but not quite below the bra strap. Just know you will be refilling the reservoir quite often. One other factor that isn&#x27;t ideal, it the \\&quot;burnt\\&quot; smell. I&#x27;m pretty sure EVERY hot iron comes with that smell, but this one is more unique. I believe anyway that the smell is coming from the burning vapor and not the burning hair as would metal irons. There is also an annoying film left from the vapor on the hot plates, it easily cleans and doesn&#x27;t effect the function of the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual hardware of the flat iron seems to be pretty good- however, it took me forever to figure out how to \\&quot;lock\\&quot; and \\&quot;unlock\\&quot; it. It&#x27;s really not that difficult, just not typical. At the very bottom, where the 2 sides meet, there is like a series of grooves, and to lock and unlock the device, you must sort of put your finger inside a groove and push it outward. The actual clear section where the vapor has to go, must be removed in order to refill. I feel this is a poor design, but again its not difficult to remove it, just not typical and sort of annoying. To remove it and place it back in, you must hold a \\&quot;button\\&quot; down and wriggle the section out in a very particular way. The same goes for putting it back in. Also, to actually refill it- you have to life a small flexible stopper and insert the nozzle of the bottle and squeeze. My issue with this is that it tends to overfill quickly and spill a bit. Its kind of fun to squeeze it in though, and watch it fill up. There is a tiny piece of plastic that broke inside of my reservoir and is just floating in the liquid. No clue how it broke off, and the whole device seems to still function well , but I felt it was worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my hair is silky, shiny, smooth and strong and I think it has a lot to do with this iron. I do use lots of other products that benefit to good hair, but I believe metal irons destroy your hair, and this one actually aids in repairing it!

    <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for a little over 3 years I think, and it just recently shorted out--not to mention that I straighten my hair just about every day. Back when my hair was really short, I used to liquid, and it really helped keep my hair straight. I have really thin, curly hair, and during the summer time, it was always a never-ending battle until I got this straightener. It still curled when it was really hot out, but it took much longer to get curly. My hair was always in a really good condition with this straightener too because my hair was never dry or damaged (with using lots of conditioner too). Up until a year ago, I stopped using the liquid, and even still, the straightener still worked. I would seriously recommend this package to anyone with curly hair or wavy hair or even straight hair. It&#x27;s probably one of the BEST straighteners I&#x27;ve ever used, and I am definitely going to go back to it.</li>
    <li> i was really excited to recieve this iron, obviously because Iam amongest the millons of women who have bad hair.    i was though dissapointed....tell you why. The vaporiizer makes your hair a little stiff, ....defeats the purpose, unless it is protecting your hair like it says,wont know that until way later.    I was expecting it to make my mair soft and protect it, so im dissapointed.    sorry.</li>
    <li> This iron was recommended to me by my stylist. Since I have a cosmetology license I was able to purchase 2 at my beauty supply store. One for me, one for my daughter.  Since it work wonderfully well for me the first 4 weeks I did not save sale receipts.  Then one morning, Christmas in fact, it sparked and shorted out! Never to come to life again.  The one I bought for my daughter for Christmas was quickly removed from the Christmas tree.  I did not want her getting a bad product.   I could not get my money back from beauty supply w/o receipt. Had to send to company + $15 to get replacement. Have not heard from them since Dec 27 when I sent shorted product to warranty center.  I have used the one that was meant for my daughter since then, without a problem until today Jan 21 when this morning it shorted out and died AGAIN.  I am very annoyed that I am out this much money, even though bought wholesale and hate that my hairdresser and the beauty supply people are pushing this product as the greatest thing on earth.  Obviously they have NOT worked out the bugs.   I am going to send the warranty center the newly shorted out item minus the $15 and just tell them NOT to replace it but to PLEASE be aware of what a shoddy product they have on the market.  This makes me question the quality of ANY Joico product. Being a former hairdresser people often ask my opinion of products and I will NOT be giving JOICO any thumbs up. Had I been able to fully recover my money then perhaps I would feel differently. For now I would say DO NOT BUY THIS DEFECTIVE, possibly dangerous product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this Flat Iron Because I&#x27;ve gone through 2 CHI flat irons so I thought it was time to go a different route. Well Im not totally in love with it. It does got hot enough, yet the Vaperfule seems to bulid up in my hair and leave it gunky. Also I really don&#x27;t get the shine I was looking for that I&#x27;ve gotten with my other flat iorns. I have already ordered a new one.</li>
    <li> First and foremost KEEP YOUR WARRANTY! the company will not allow you to return your flat iron to be fixed without it. I mistakenly threw mine out when I was given this product as a gift, and 3 short month later, when it now refuses to heat up (maybe a short of some kind, other reviews mention that) I am out of luck, the proud owner of a plastic piece of crap. When it worked it was an amazing flat iron, but the quality of the product is so bad that I wouldn&#x27;t waste the money, just get a chi they tend to hold up.</li>
    <li> If you know the science of hair you will understand why this is such a great tool to have. Not only does this make your hair shiny and beautiful but it physically repairs and protects against damage. The vapor is infused with human hair keratin. This is the only protein that will repair your hair, not just coat the cuticle. Organic and animal proteins are too big in molecular size to penetrate the hair strand and sit on the cuticle as where keratin will go in and fill the holes in your hair strand fixing and repairing at the source. The fact that you are now mixing this with heat to open the cuticle allows for maximum deposit into the hair. I have used this on clients with extremely damaged hair, coarse hair and fine hair and the results are amazing..... Now for the down side (why this gets 4 stars not 5). There was a manufacturing defect in the original design causing irons to leak the vapor which would get into the electrical system of the iron and cause it to short out. Joico has since fixed this and replaced the irons currently on the shelf. If you do not have your receipt try contacting a joico rep and they should replace them. Hope this review helps!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product. Let me start by saying, I did not purchase this product from Amazon but rather from a professional stylist.  I&#x27;ve had two of these irons and both shorted out. The last one actually threw out a large spark that could have burned me if I had been anywhere near it. Although I could go back to my stylist again and request another replacement, I really do not want one in my home for fear that it&#x27;s an unsafe product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this very expensive flat iron 4 times on a recommendation from a salon stylist. My previous flat iron worked fine, but they insisted this would be better on my hair with the keratin based vapor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used it 4 times in a period of about a month and half way into straightening my hair, it just stops working. I thought I blew tripped a breaker or something, but no - it won&#x27;t work in any other outlet now, while I can still get other electronics working fine. Tried to let it cool down, still nothing. It&#x27;s shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m yet to send it back for a refund (which I will be wanting a refund, not a replacement) and just keep using the old wet/dry straightener that has worked great for me for almost a year with no shorting out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a warning to buyers looking for a quality straightener: price does not equal quality and this iron is proof of that. Look for something else.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. Leaves hair silky and smooth. Salon looking hair for a long time and for much cheaper.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener after a hairdresser did my hair with it and I loved the result.. I had read that this product shorted out  after a few weeks of use. I figured I would give it a try because it worked so good at the salon. The straightener did work great for the short time that I had it, unfortunately it did short out. I am very disappointed. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The first one of these irons I bought at a salon and it cost 174.00. I had it for 2 years and dropped it breaking the resavoir. I was happy to see this product much cheaper on amazon but just doesnt seem to work the same not sure  what the problem is but it does the job so for the price I will keep it.</li>
    <li> The device sure did a great job on my hair - for only 90 days. Like all others here, one day, out of nowhere, my flatiron sparked, popped and died,  for good. It does not turn on anymore, and now I have 2 big bottles of the refill liquid at home for no use.</li>
    <li> Piece of junk! The first one I bought caught on fire... The replacement just quit working.... I called the salon they said they said they cant do anything..........I was originally told they would honor the warranty and swop it out if it breaks.... Bullcrap... Then I was told they quit swapping out broken ones for new ones cause so many people has been bringing them back cause they keep breaking.... The vapor is a joke.... Makes my hair oily and limp.. I would of been better off buying one from Wal-Mart in the clearance isle..</li>
    <li> the straightener works amazing i love how it has the solution that you can put in it, but i have only had it for 4 days and for some reason it just all of a sudden stopped working on me. I hope i can get an exchange or a refund for it</li>
    <li> A couple months after I purchased this flat iron, it shorted out and completely stopped working. Luckily I bought it from my hair stylist who was able to replace it for me. Recently my replacement did the same thing. I also have to note that I only use my flat iron periodically so it wasn&#x27;t from heavy use. I was really disappointed in the product and will definitely be taking the refund instead of the replacement this time.</li>
    <li> This is the only flat iron I will use. Love the keratin liquid. My curly hair is straight as a board. Love it.</li>
    <li> Broke in two months. Sent to get replaced. Never got another one back or a refund. Piece of crap.</li>
    <li> I loved this iron. It was truly amazing. I only had it for a few months. It, too, SPARKED (while I was holding it) and then it died. It also made half the outlets in my room fuse out. I should&#x27;ve listen to the reviews on Amazon. DON&#x27;T get it. :(</li>
    <li> My hair is greatly damaged by bleach and very porous.  The Joico vapor iron has worked wonders for the appearance.  People can&#x27;t tell how damaged it is. When mine was misplaced I purchase a cheaper version by another company.  I ended up having to reorder another Joico Vapor Iron because it was the only product I found that worked on extremely damaged hair.</li>
    <li> When I first bought my joico reconstruct iron I loved it so much but right after it arrived it had btoken so I exchanged it and got another. I was still pretty pleased with this one but now that one has broken too and I&#x27;m not about to buy another. Breaks way to easily for any amount of money, especially considering we paid roughly a hundred dollars. Very disappointed with joico.</li>
    <li> My previous hair stylist recommended this a couple of years ago, and the device has had no trouble with electrical issues or shorting out, however it is just not that great. I have long thick wavy hair and it takes FOREVER to get straight with this flat iron. The vapor makes my hair feel sticky and with or without the vapor my hair appears dull. I am not impressed with the plates and the price is outrageous considering the results. I am getting rid of this thing, just like I did that hair stylist.</li>
    <li> I loved how my hair looked healthier after using this iron but was dissappointed that it stopped heating up after a few months of using it.  Thankfully it was within the 1 yr warranty and I was able to get it replaced.</li>
    <li> I bought mine in the winter of 2011 because they looked cool. The girl in the local CosmoProf said everyone that bought them loved them and no one has returned them (leading me to believe that I got the improved ones).  I ran home, washed my hair, and did all my maintenance to prepare for heat styling.  I put the vapor fuel in and I began to straighten my hair.  I did two passes on each section to be sure.  I loved the final result.  It actually was pretty straight and had body.  It actually stayed for about 4 days when I tied it with a wrap overnight.  As to the product  upkeep, I do not wrap my cord around the product.  I wrap the cord s-like and put a wrap around the cord to avoid the inside from shorting.  I also plug it into a a GFCI outlet so that if there is a surge to the appliance the switch is tripped and my iron is not ruined.  It was easy to change my bath outlet to one of these if I just made sure the power was off to the bathroom before I installed. BTW, my hair type is 4a.</li>
    <li> I have had this flat iron for six months. The first three months were good, and, I loved it. Then, it shorted out as I was getting ready to go out on a first date. I had to call my beautician and she not only replaced it with a new flat iron, but, she did my hair for me. Phew!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That replacement lasted until five minutes ago, when it shorted out, again. I saw a spark, heard a poof then saw smoke. All I kept thinking was \\&quot;Really?? Again??\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind replacing this expensive flat iron every three months, go for it. My beautician said she&#x27;d replace this one, temporarily, but she indicated she&#x27;s done with Joico flat irons. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because it is what my hairstylist uses and I had been very unsatisfied with my straightener that I was using. I felt that my hair always smelled funny with my old flat iron and I had used several but most did not get my hair straight unless the iron was extremely hot and then my hair smelled burnt and looked dull all the time. I read the negative reviews on this product but decided to try it. It took me a little bit to get use to this as you must pull your hair through the straightener much slower than I had been use to. It works great, my hair looks shiny and healthy. The reviews that I read about this stated that the flatiron shorted out and so after I use it I push the button that makes it steam in the off position and I also store it with the cord in the upright position, thinking that possibly the liquid is draining toward the cord during storage and causing it to short out when plugged in. So far I have not had any trouble. I would definitely purchase this again. I have been very pleased.</li>
    <li> The Joico Reconstrx K-pak is the best flat iron I have ever purchased. My hair is very course and dry so I need the extra conditioning that the vapor steam gives me.  There is also a temperature dial that you can adjust to a lower degree so you will never burn your hair.  Most flat irons do not have the temperature dial.  I recommend setting the flat iron to a lower temperature so you will never scorch your hair again!  It also shuts off automatically so you never have to worry about leaving the flat iron on.  If you want a more conditioned, silky, shiny look this is the flat iron for you.  It also comes with a dvd that will show you how to smooth or curl.</li>
    <li> TThe joico kpak reconstruct works great! The more you use it, the more it helps your hair. the only downside is the ridiculous price.</li>
    <li> I do like the K-pak Reconstrux because of how my hair looks and feels WHEN the iron is working right. Even if this latest one that I got is working okay for the moment, unfortunately there was no place that I could register a warranty on it and if there was, I wouldn&amp;#34;t know because the documents were all in Spanish (not like the ones I had in the past).</li>
    <li> great price, hard to find product.&lt;br /&gt;The curling iron was great, but kept leaking.&lt;br /&gt;Returned it, received another one, but it leaked after about a month also.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to have found the item as I had been looking for it to be given as a gift.  Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> The reason I hate it is because it stops working after a couple of weeks or, if  you&#x27;re lucky, a few months.  When it does work, it&#x27;s the greatest flat iron ever.  Makes the hair smooth,silky, and shiny.  This is my fourth one within the last six months.  It is extremely frustrating that a well-known company like Joico can&#x27;t fix an ongoing problem.  According to hundreds of customer reviews, the problem of the iron not working for very long has been a problem for years.  Why is Joico not making an effort to correct this nuisance.  It would be perfect if it actually worked for longer than a few months.</li>
    <li> I loved this iron. It made my hair silky smooth with beautiful movement. Unfortunately it only worked for 1 week before it started leaking and stopped working. This was the second time I bought this iron and both times it fizzled out after a week or two. So disappointed.  I understand that Joico has discontinued this product. Too bad they just didn&#x27;t figure out how to make it work properly without breaking because it was FANTASTIC for the week or two while it was working.</li>
