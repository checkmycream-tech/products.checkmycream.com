      <li>I LOVE IT!!</li>

      <li>so, SO easy to use and works perfectly.</li>
      <li>But it is GREAT, I love it!</li>

      <li>If your trying to find a good straightener, you don&#x27;t have to look anymore.  </li>

      <li>Great product, fast delivery, and a better price than you can get ANYWHERE!!!!</li>
      <li>Very pleased.</li>
      <li>All in all, I am very pleased with this purchase.    </li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with this product.  </li>
      <li>I liked this iron a lot and got much good use out of it (which is why I still gave it 2 stars).  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this straightning iron!  </li>
      <li>Love this ceramic straightening iron!</li>
      <li>It works like magic!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in LOVE with it!</li>
      <li>I am able to restyle it with the CHI and it looks as good as it did that morning.</li>
      <li>probably my own fault.</li>
      <li>so kind of prone to breakage, but</li>
      <li>I had never straightened my hair on my own until I bought this straightener.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s best to use some product on your hair before using the iron to coat the hairs and protect them from the high heat.</li>
      <li>So far its the best straightener i have ever used, and i have used many!</li>
      <li>and she was super happy with it.</li>
      <li>I used it today for the first time, and it works beautifully.</li>
      <li>If yours functions, it seems like a good value with the free hair products you get with it.</li>
      <li>It heats up fast and works real nice.</li>
      <li>I love love love my CHI and you will too!</li>
      <li>While this one does not have an adjustable temperature dial, you do not need it - this tool heats up to the perfect temperature to hold the style all day, while adding shine - plus it will not dry or damage the hair.</li>
      <li>Take good care of this product and it will be well worth your dough. &#x3D;]</li>
      <li>She paid about 10 bucks more in the salon than I found here.</li>
      <li>I do recommend the protective spray to make sure you don&#x27;t damage your hair.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure I could have found a cheaper version to do the job, but for those of you that have hard-to-manage hair</li>
      <li>It works great, heats up fast.</li>
      <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t look frizzy when I&#x27;m done</li>
      <li>She has used many straighteners and I wanted to buy her a \\&quot;nice\\&quot; one.</li>
      <li>This retails elsewhere for quite a bit more.  </li>
      <li>I absoulutely love it.</li>
      <li>If you send a $35 check, they will either fix or most of the time REPLACE your straightener.</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the Chi Iron.</li>
      <li>I love this straightener.</li>
      <li>for chi better results</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s really cute.</li>
      <li>I brought my flat iron about two year ago and it still works perfectly.</li>
      <li>Best flat iron I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I assumed that after paying 100 dollars for a flat iron, that it should be awesome.  </li>
      <li>This the best flat iron I ever had.</li>
      <li>This straightener gets VERY hot quickly, which is great when you are in a rush.</li>
      <li>This is the BEST flat iron that I&#x27;ve ever had!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had the original Chi for over 4years, and it&#x27;s still going strong!</li>
      <li>Everyone tells me how great I look now with my sleek hairstyle as opposed to my puffy 80&#x27;s natural look.</li>
      <li>I tried the products that came with it, but they didn&#x27;t really seem to do anything but make my hair stickier and stiffer after straightening, so even though they smell good, I stopped using them.  </li>
      <li>The delivery was fast and i am a very satisfied customer.  </li>
      <li>This is the best flat iron I have ever purchased and well worth the money.</li>
      <li>I had heard so many great reviews about the CHI, but I don&#x27;t really see that much of a difference in my hair.  </li>
      <li>when I use this flat iron it looks beautiful like the women on relaxer boxes and commercials.</li>
      <li>The light wouldn&#x27;t come on, the plates wouldn&#x27;t heat up, etc.</li>
      <li>My sister had been telling my about this product for the last year and raving about how great it was.</li>
      <li>And it looks fantastic.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
      <li>I got my new Chi and just love it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with this product and it&#x27;s so easy to use and fast too.</li>
      <li>It was pricy but worth every penny!</li>
      <li>Bottom line, this straightener is worth the investment!</li>
      <li>The straightener is well worth the money for the time it saves and the results it produces!</li>
      <li>:  this is definitely worth the money!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
      <li>And then I saw this beautiful pink color...</li>
      <li>I even took a long run yesterday and my hair still looks great -</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter who has thick hair. She has used many straighteners and I wanted to buy her a \\&quot;nice\\&quot; one. She had it for approximately 2 weeks when the on/off switch just fell off, actually it fell inside the iron. So she could not turn the iron on. Fortunately, it broke within 90 days of purchasing it on Amazon, so I had no problem with getting my money back.</li>
    <li> My sister got this flat iron at a good price at the salon we go to...it was this exact set with the Chi Silk Infusion, Heat Protector, and 1\\&quot; Pink Flat Iron. She paid about 10 bucks more in the salon than I found here. So I got mine here instead. Bascially I thought she was crazy for spending so much on this appliance, but once I tried it out, I knew the first time I used it I needed one! It is so, so, SO easy to use and works perfectly. It does get a bit hot for my delecate hair, but I just turn off the switch for a few minutes and then back on if I need to reheat. It does the job so quickly and effortlessly. I have manageable hair and I&#x27;m sure I could have found a cheaper version to do the job, but for those of you that have hard-to-manage hair this is the WAY TO GO!!</li>
    <li> The best ever...Great product, fast delivery, and a better price than you can get ANYWHERE!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the chi since I was 17 years old. I am now 21 and i left my original chi at a hotel. Of course, the people who worked at the hotel the haven&#x27;t seen it...right. Anyways i bought the limited adition chi with all of its great products that come with it. I LOVE IT!! It works just as well as my lost chi, but it&#x27;s even better because the 2 hair products work excellent with the straightner. The delivery was fast and i am a very satisfied customer.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> i bought this for my girlfriend for christmas and she was super happy with it. evidentally having a pink chi is like a really big deal if you are a girl. anyways it was a great deal. 115 bucks i think and it came with the straightener and 2 bottles of chi protectant for your hair. every where else i looked it was close to 200 dollars. great deal and i definately reccomend this to anyone who wants a pink chi!</li>
    <li> The PINK CHI IRON heats up quickly, works wonderfully, and using the included hair products prevents the damage normally seen when using a \\&quot;flat iron\\&quot;.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I LOVE the Chi Iron. It works great, heats up fast. Normally I can wear my hair straight without issue for at least 2 days with this iron. Everyone tells me how great I look now with my sleek hairstyle as opposed to my puffy 80&#x27;s natural look. LOL</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 14 year old daughter.  She absolutely loves it.  Not your \\&quot;average\\&quot; straightener.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughters birthday &amp; she absolutely loves it.  It&#x27;s only been used a couple of times, but so far she&#x27;s happy.  CHI makes great products.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my ex fiancé she was a whore</li>
    <li> This was a big hit for my 15 year old daughter for Christmas. Especially, the fact that it was pink. Loved the products that were included. They were an added bonus.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST flat iron that I&#x27;ve ever had!  It even keeps my hair shiny and straight in the humid weather.  I don&#x27;t use the hair products that came with it because they smell like men&#x27;s cologne, but I do love the flat iron!</li>
    <li> Even though it is a inch straighter it still works extremely well!  This product makes my hair really straight and silky looking.  It&#x27;s also pink so it&#x27;s really cute.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. My last one was cheap and burned out in about a year. With this one, I spend half as long in the bathroom fixing my hair, and it looks noticeably better. I would recommend a Chi to anyone.</li>
    <li> My roommate used this the day after I got it in the mail. I was the second person to use it and it no longer worked. The light wouldn&#x27;t come on, the plates wouldn&#x27;t heat up, etc. Thankfully, Amazon had no problem with me returning it. If yours functions, it seems like a good value with the free hair products you get with it.</li>
    <li> This Chi was super cute, but it didn&#x27;t work as well as the other Chi&#x27;s.  My hair is naturally curly and full of frizz so this straightener just didn&#x27;t work for me.  Someone with less frizz might still be able to use this one, but I still think the regular one works best.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant at first about spending so much money on a flat iron, but it was well worth it. I have wavy hair and even when I blow dry it, it&#x27;s still wavy. My little old vidal sassoon flat iron was not working very well. My chi heats up in literally 20 seconds and it straightens my hair IMMEDIATELY!! I have very thick hair and it only takes me about 3-5 minutes to straighten all of it! I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> The best I&#x27;ve used, although I think it&#x27;s no longer being made.</li>
    <li> A CHI straightener is definitely a great investment. Mine works wonderfully! I also had no problem with the shipping. It came even before I expected it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been putting off buying one of these for a long time due to cost.  But a couple of months ago, the time was right and the money was in the bank.  This saves me SO much time straightening my hair!  And it looks fantastic.  I have majorly curly hair, and this guy works wonders.    Word of advice: wait until it cools down to put it away, and wrap the chord separately instead of around the iron.  It&#x27;ll last you longer.</li>
    <li> My wife has wanted a Chi for years, she knows exactly what she likes and what she doesn&#x27;t.  Typically she only likes the highest quality products, so, I got her the Chi and she loves it.  We knew she would.</li>
    <li> There is one thing I have to say for this product - believe the hype! I have wavy almost curly hair but this straightener keeps it straight all day even in humidity. The products are great (yes, they do smell a little like men&#x27;s cologne but it smells good!) and this is a really good package price too. I love love love my CHI and you will too!</li>
    <li> I recieved this item last year for my birthday (November, 2007).  I don&#x27;t use it every day, but I do use it a lot.  Just this month (December, 2008) I was heating up the iron.  I went back to check on it after about three minutes, and the plates were completely melting off the iron.  I liked this iron a lot and got much good use out of it (which is why I still gave it 2 stars).  My only original complaint was the lack of temperature control.  But it&#x27;s unacceptable to have the plates melt right off, especially one month after the warranty expires.</li>
    <li> Our family purchased two because our daughters have thick hair + these work great without drying out the hair.</li>
    <li> This retails elsewhere for quite a bit more.  It was purchased as a gift for my teenage daughter and she LOVES IT!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much time the CHI saves me each morning. It takes no time at all to curl my hair and get out the door.  Plus if I need to redo my hair before going out I don&#x27;t need to re-wash it I am able to restyle it with the CHI and it looks as good as it did that morning. I do recommend the protective spray to make sure you don&#x27;t damage your hair. But it is GREAT, I love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased the CHI for my daughter in Sept. &#x27;07 as a Christmas gift. I paid $119.  The CHI stopped working on Jan. 13th after less than four weeks of use.  No way to return to Amazon because it was past 30 days. Amazon says there is a one-year warranty on their website.  Unfortunately, Farouk will not honor the warranty because Amazon is not an authorized distributor.  Amazon should not list the one-year warranty if they know the manufacturer won&#x27;t honor it.  I have a Wella straightener I purchased from my hair dresser and my daughter and I have been sharing it for over a year.  It is well made and feels sturdy.  It heats up incredibly fast and straightens or curls.  The CHI feels cheaply made and just stopped working after only my daughter using it for a short three weeks.  Farouk doesn&#x27;t stand behind their cheaply made products and Amazon is advertising a warranty that they know is not valid if you purchase the item on their website.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Chi straightener in September 2007 directly from Amazon.com. Power switch went bad 9 months later. Farouk Systems Group, the manufacturer of the Chi, was contacted and they straight out told me that they would not honor the one year warranty since I purchased it through an online vendor. I then contacted Amazon and even though I purchased the product directly from the Amazon.com store, customer service told me there was nothing they could do to help me. Amazon clearly needs to investigate the products and companies they represent and sell more closely. I&#x27;m out $120.00 for this defective Chi but the real loser in this will be Amazon and all the business they lose from me as a result.</li>
    <li> I got my new Chi and just love it! My hair stays straight all day long and it is normally naturally curly/wavy. The spray and silk serum that come w/ it are great products! They work well and smell great. You definitely need to use them though, as it does get VERY VERY hot. Overall, very happy w/ the purchase and worth the big price :-)</li>
    <li> I debated for quite a while whether to invest in a Chi straightener.  I have been disappointed in the Big Box Store straighteners I have purchased in the past and they were a lot cheaper.  I caved in and bought this pink Chi, which came with the thermal protection spray and silk infusion.  First the straightener:  this is definitely worth the money!  I have fly-away hair that seems impossible to control on any humid or rainy day.  Using the Chi in the morning, my hair stays straight and in control all day with no hairspray needed.  I would definitely recommend a thermal spray of some kind, though, as the straightener does get very hot and does not have an adjustable thermostat (if I could deduct 1/2 star for this, I would).  The Chi thermal protection spray seems to work (I&#x27;ve been using the straightener for about a month and no obvious damage to my hair) and does not leave a heavy residue on my hair.  Read the instructions though.  I stupidly sprayed it on before I dried my hair and it made a gummy mess.  Spray it on DRY hair, then use the straightener.  I also use the Silk Infusion that came in the package.  I love the smell of the serum and it leaves my hair with a nice sheen without weighing it down.  All in all, I am very pleased with this purchase.    UPDATED, MAY 2008:  After 1 yr (the warranty) and 4 months, the straightener died on me.  I am therefore adding a new review to indicate so and lower my rating.  Buyer be warned...you will not get much time out of it over the warranty period.  Make the decision if the cost is worth it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fantastic. I use it with the chi flat iron spray and my hair is straight with no damage. Best flat iron I&#x27;ve used. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> There was absolutly nothing wrong with this product, but I just wasn&#x27;t too impressed.  I do like the product, but I don&#x27;t know if it was worth the money.  I had heard so many great reviews about the CHI, but I don&#x27;t really see that much of a difference in my hair.  My hair is pretty thick, so I was hoping it would reduce the amount of time needed to stlye it, but like I said, its not much better than the $50 ones you can get anywhere.</li>
    <li> It does a good job straightening my hair but if you have thick long hair it&#x27;s too narrow and doesn&#x27;t cover enough area.  I feel ok using it a couple times a week, but not everyday because I still feel like it is drying out or damaging my hair.</li>
    <li> My only complaint with the CHI is that occasionally I get this very faint, almost distant whiff of burnt hair. So you don&#x27;t want to over stress your hair! however, when used properly, this flat iron is the best at straightening. I live in florida, humidity is inevitable, but its not a problem. THis is the only flat iron I can say that with, and I have tried others. My hair would always poof right back up. I don&#x27;t even remember the last time I used a blow dryer to straighten my hair. Very good product. The hair styling products that come with it smell a little like men&#x27;s colgne, but you have to use SOMETHING to protect your hair, and they do work. The shine really makes my hair look sleak and healthy. Hey, its beats smelling like burnt toast.   &#x3D;P</li>
    <li> Although the Chi irons do not last as long as I would desire, especially for the cost. It is the best ceramic iron out there. Be very careful with the cord, moving the iron to various locations, wears and tears on it.</li>
    <li> I had never straightened my hair on my own until I bought this straightener. It works like magic! My hair is soft and shiny and completely straight and is not hard to do! I love it and have been straightening my hair regularly since I bought it.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever purchased and well worth the money. No other store bought iron compares and the price is definitely a bargain. I do not put heat on my hair often and with the use of this iron I am able to flat iron my hair once a week and my style holds up.</li>
    <li> i though when i bought this chi i thought it was going to work like magic and one strip of my hair would be thin and silky well i was wrng it takes alot of work and alot of burning hair my hair was already burned from last straightener now this!!!! Well then i had my dad buy the conditioning stu on here for chi better results my hair was how i imagened and i was real happy with my hair but its not easy for an 12 year old girl to straighten hair but basicly im telling you to buy the chi conditioning with it it will have better results                       -kayla!!!</li>
    <li> It heats up fast and works real nice. The included products were a bonus! Received item VERY FAST even though it was only weeks before Christmas. I recommend this seller and item.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome hair straightner! Ideal for the straightener Goddesses out there, and those who are addicted to straightening her hair! I&#x27;m in LOVE with it! And it shipped really fast.</li>
    <li> My arms used to get so sore because I&#x27;d blow-dry my thick, frizzy, curly hair for about 1 1/2 hours and then have to go over it again with a cheapy flat iron from wal-mart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having a stylist at Mastercuts use this on my hair and achieve even better results in under half an hour, I knew I had to buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great price considering at most places like Trade Secret, the iron alone can cost about $129 plus tax, plus the Chi products are $15 and up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great value, and it benefits a great cause, so why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you have unruly, thick, curly hair- this is the product for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful because it does get really hot- I burned my ear a bit. Other than some common sense, anyone can use it and achieve great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried messing with it to flip out my hair and curl it, and I&#x27;ve almost got it down.</li>
    <li> I really like my Chi straightener! I have thin, mostly straight but sometimes wavy hair, and this works really well. The only issue I have is that I have to put more pressure to clamp down on my hair (again, could be because of my thin hair). Otherwise, it heats up really fast and is easy to control. And I love the pink!</li>
    <li> Well, Amazon no longer carries the flat iron that I loved.  So, I decided to move on to a different brand.  I assumed that after paying 100 dollars for a flat iron, that it should be awesome.  Although this does seem like a good flat iron, meaning it does what it should, I am disappointed in two things:  1) The iron gets very hot and has no temperature selector.  My 40 dollar one had this, why not on a 100 dollar one!?  2) It seems to be built a bit flimsy.  But, on the flip side:  1) It heats up SUPER fast.  My other one I would plug in while I blow dried my hair and it was hot by the time I was finished.  This one, however, is ready to go only about 45 seconds after plugging it in.  2) It&#x27;s pretty.</li>
    <li> Love this ceramic straightening iron! It&#x27;s easy to handle, gets hot really fast and has a great pivot feature on the cord that allows the iron to lay flat on a surface without falling over on its side. I like that this package came with the CHI styling products. It&#x27;s best to use some product on your hair before using the iron to coat the hairs and protect them from the high heat.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s just say that this girl with wavy, coarse, thick hair could not be happier with this product.  My hair gets straight and stays straight all day and night.  I love the thermal protecting spray, not so wild about the serum as it makes my hair oily.  With that being said, it might be great for another hair type, just not mine.  I read the reviews before I purchased this product, and some were not glowing.  My experience has been nothing but positive, and I hope this helps you!</li>
    <li> I bought this for the wife. Its a bit expensive for a straighter, but she insists its awesome. She loves it, and loves braging that she has one. What she likes: It heats up very fast - Name brand - and can \\&quot;flip\\&quot; \\&quot;curl\\&quot; too.  She dosent like: that when plugged in, no other items can be plugged in at the same time due to large circuit breaker built in.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I looked everywhere where we live and could not find a better price. This straightener gets VERY hot quickly, which is great when you are in a rush. I do think the entire casing feels very cheap, but it hasn&#x27;t broken when dropped...so all in all I am impressed.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product.  it heats up quickly and straightens my hair with very little effort.  I have lived with naturally curly hair all my life and it is so nice to now have a choice.  The products that came with it work well.  They sell for about $18.00 apiece at local stores so these are a bargain coming with the Chi straightener.  I would certainly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but I should of spent a little more money and gotten the 2\\&quot; one. I have so much hair, that it takes too long to straignten all of my hair with a 1\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener at the advice of my hairdresser (well, the PINK one was my idea) and this is by far the best product I&#x27;ve ever used. I even took a long run yesterday and my hair still looks great - and it&#x27;s usually a nappy, tangled mess after I work out. There really is nothing better than the CHI for straight, silky hair. I&#x27;ve used it on a couple friends and they swore to go out and buy it. It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
    <li> The straightener is well worth the money for the time it saves and the results it produces!</li>
    <li> I admit I almost didn&#x27;t believe that this flat iron would work. My sister had been telling my about this product for the last year and raving about how great it was. I didn&#x27;t think that there was a product out there that could tame my naturally frezzy, curly, thick hair and had just about given up hope that it would every look good. But a few weeks ago I had gotten a haircut and almost everyone I knew complemented me on how good it looked and then this week my sister came down for Christmas, bringing her Chi with her. I decided I would try it, still not convinced. But once she was done I was amazed. It worked! My hair was straight and not to mention also shinny and not frezzy. It wasn&#x27;t even as poofy as it normally was and the next day looked just a good with a little touch up. I was so surpised about that because when I go to bed with curly hair I wake up looking like Scary Spice back in 1997 and as a result have to wash my hair to make it look okay again. When using this Chi I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair for a least 2 days and even everyone in my family said I looked so differnt. I&#x27;m in love with this product and it&#x27;s so easy to use and fast too. With my hair about 30 mins or so will do. I would recommend this to anyone and I&#x27;m so glad I can go into the new year and internship with a new look and and a great product that works.</li>
    <li> Did not work on my hair type, did not straighten my hair, left it looking dry and frizzy, I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> However, when you buy the limited edition ones or the colorful ones, they tend to stop working after a few months. I decided to invent in the original CHI (the black one), and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it. I&#x27;ve had the original Chi for over 4years, and it&#x27;s still going strong!</li>
    <li> I had this Chi for almost two years before the power switch broke off...probably my own fault. BUT if you call Chi they will give you an address to send your straightener to. If you send a $35 check, they will either fix or most of the time REPLACE your straightener. Buy it.</li>
    <li> This the best flat iron I ever had. I absoulutely love it. I brought my flat iron about two year ago and it still works perfectly. My hair feels so shiny and bouncy when I use this with alittle heat protectant and chi silk infusion. Every time I flat iron (which is probably once a month) I get so many compliments. First off, I have relaxed thick coarse hair that is very dry so kind of prone to breakage, but when I use this flat iron it looks beautiful like the women on relaxer boxes and commercials. I am not exaggerating at all. It is well worth the money, and this seller sends the product very quickly. Also remember everyone to not apply to much heat to the hair. Heat can leave your hair in a state of true disturbia. I relax every 12 weeks, so I try to flat iron only once or twice a month and just rollerset or airdry my hair. On the days I airdry I just wear a bun or braidout. Try this if you have hair issues and you will see great growth. Anyways GOOOO Chi!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this straightning iron!  With my old one, my hair would curl back up after a while, especially in moderate humidity.  After using this straightner, my hair didn&#x27;t even think about curling after being on the beach in the wind and salt air for 7 hours!  I tried the products that came with it, but they didn&#x27;t really seem to do anything but make my hair stickier and stiffer after straightening, so even though they smell good, I stopped using them.  I recommend the iron, but not the products.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered the t3 tourmaline straighter, for 160!, once i received it i was so excited to try it, but it was so awful. I sent it back and got this. I used it today for the first time, and it works beautifully. So far its the best straightener i have ever used, and i have used many! definitly recomment it</li>
    <li> CHI is the best hair straightener out there! If your trying to find a good straightener, you don&#x27;t have to look anymore.  It works so well and keeps your hair straight so that you don&#x27;t have to straighten it again later in the day.  I love it even more because it&#x27;s pink.  I was a little hesitant about buying a 100$ and up hair device but it really proved its worth.  Before I bought it, I looked through a ton of reviews.  If your going to buy this item, you should know that the button will melt if you leave it on for a long period of time. Take good care of this product and it will be well worth your dough. &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> I have had this iron for two weeks shy of a year.  The iron stopped working.  I thought, \\&quot;Great!  Finally something actually breaks down two weeks BEFORE the warranty runs out instead of two weeks after!\\&quot;  After contacting Farouk, I learned that the warranty is VOID if the product is purchased over the internet.  This was in no way, shape, or form disclosed to me when I purchased my iron.  DO NOT BUY!!  WAY too much money to drop on a flat iron that doesn&#x27;t even have a valid warranty!</li>
    <li> I love the CHI products and bought this item to go with the pink CHI blow dryer I have. The pinks don&#x27;t match, but this item works very well.</li>
    <li> It was pricy but worth every penny! I immediatly started getting complements and was told how glamourous I looked. I have always struggled with slight frizz and have used curling irons and other straighteners in the past, but this is like some kind of magic wand. Buy it for yourself! You deserve to look beautiful!</li>
    <li> My Chi stopped working after just two months. I contacted the maker, Farouk for a replacement based on the one year warranty promoted by Amazon on their website.I was told Amazon wasn&#x27;t an authorized dealer so they would not replace the Chi. I talked to Amazon and they said sorry but it&#x27;s past the thirty days for a full refund or exchange and it&#x27;s not our problem Farouk won&#x27;t replace it. So,order with caution! If anything goes wrong you are simply out of luck. I&#x27;ve had cheaper flat irons over the years and they&#x27;re still working. The one time I spend over $100, it lasts two months and neither the maker or seller is willing to stand behind the product. Shame on Amazon for lying to their customers.</li>
    <li> I have purchased nearly every brand of flat iron out there but this is the last brand I will ever buy!  All the others lasted 6 months at the most, over dried my hair, and did not maintain a consistent temperature.  While this one does not have an adjustable temperature dial, you do not need it - this tool heats up to the perfect temperature to hold the style all day, while adding shine - plus it will not dry or damage the hair. The products are good, just be careful not to use too much or your hair will be silky, shiny, but flat. A little goes a long way! Purchase this flat iron - you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> Finally after years of different products and styling tools I&#x27;ve found one worth investing in.  I&#x27;ve been using the two Chi hair products that came with the straightener, Straight Guard and Chi Infusion...GREAT products, no greasy feel left on your hands when your done, no stiff sticky feel in your hair.  The products leave my hair feeling as though it is natural and product free, all the while protecting it from the heat.  I received my Chi soon after I got my hair cut.  In times past I could only go a month after a hair cut and then my ends looked sick and horrible.  This time however, it&#x27;s been 2 months and my ends still look great.  The iron does what it says it will do!  It straightens and conditions.  I love that it doesn&#x27;t look frizzy when I&#x27;m done and I&#x27;ve had that with so many other \\&quot;good professional\\&quot; straighteners.  Bottom line, this straightener is worth the investment!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for a year. I owned a Chi for the previous 3 years, but the cord shorted out. So far the power cord is strong and the swivel point shows no sign of wear. I have thicker wavy/curly hair. This heats up fast and straightens my hair out easily. After my first Chi broke, then I tried a couple brands from the store. But they do not compare in any way to the Chi!! And then I saw this beautiful pink color... and it&#x27;s just perfect for me.</li>
