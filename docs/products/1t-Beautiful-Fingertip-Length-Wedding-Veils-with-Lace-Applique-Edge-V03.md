      <li>Yes it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
      <li>Not impress with it at all, seem cheap .</li>
      <li>This is cheap.</li>
      <li>The effect was so unique a couple at the after-party venue asked her who had custom-made her veil.</li>
      <li>Super cheap quality.  </li>
      <li>Very pretty and arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>Very pretty.</li>
      <li>It was beautiful but looked like it had cheap material and poor workmanship.</li>
      <li>With careful placement I&#x27;m sure this veil will be fine.  </li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>I trimmed the threads off and it looks pretty.</li>
      <li>, it is very obvious and more in person, I wish I had done that.</li>
      <li>no combs or clips which is exactly what we wanted for my daughter&#x27;s wedding.  </li>
      <li>simple yet elegant</li>
      <li>Be aware there is no comb in it</li>
      <li>After hanging it up in the closet for a few days, all the wrinkle came out, and I am very pleased with t.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend!</li>
      <li>Bridal salons charge way too much.</li>
      <li>I am very please with the veil, it is much prettier in person.</li>
      <li>The veil does not look anything like it does in the picture and has a really funky smell.</li>
      <li>I did not pay much</li>
      <li>but since it was only $7+ and free shipping I decided to give it a try.</li>
      <li>I was really looking forward to wearing this.</li>
      <li>so thanks</li>
      <li>It really looks like garbage.  </li>
      <li>The time arrival was on time and fast.</li>
      <li>This is pretty and I look forward to seeing my new bride wear it.</li>
      <li>They then sent me a new one that was in fact actually ivory, but it was so incredibly cheap.</li>
      <li>Better than paying a fortune at the bridal stores for something people only see for short period of time.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware of it coming from China, so if you need it fast make sure you order it at least 30 days before.</li>
      <li>I was hoping it would be a little better quality than what it turned out to be.</li>
      <li>Not really ivory , seem more white .</li>
      <li>Just got this in the mail two weeks early!</li>
      <li>The ivory is quite pale, almost white, the tulle is very fine, and the lace has a soft sheen to it.  </li>
      <li>Which can be fixed with some scissors.</li>
      <li>But nothing that couldn&#x27;t be fixed.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love the delicate fabric, and I will be purchasing another for \\&quot;just in case\\&quot; purposes for at the wedding.</li>
      <li>I went to my local craft store and bought a clear hair comb and some jewels.</li>
      <li>So very much cheaper than the ones I had previously looked at.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Maybe I misunderstood what &amp;#34;lace applique&amp;#34; meant, but this veil is definitely not what i expected.  The veil is tulle (i don&#x27;t know tulle - i can&#x27;t opine on whether it&#x27;s high or low quality tulle), and it has a lace pattern embroidered on a separate piece of tulle, and then that lacey tulle is cut out around the lace embroidery and haphazardly stitched onto the bottom of the veil with what looks like fishing line.  Super cheap quality.  It really looks like garbage.  I mean, it totally makes sense considering the cost, but that&#x27;s not how it was described.  This would make a perfect halloween costume, or bachelorette party item, but you would NOT want to wear this for a real wedding.</li>
    <li> It is beautiful and the perfect length</li>
    <li> Yes it&#x27;s cheap. Yes you may need to snip stuff off and sew in a comb. For the price though you can&#x27;t beat this! It is very nice.</li>
    <li> Returned not exactly what I wanted. It looked more like a table runner.</li>
    <li> I found this to be a really great product. I would definitely recommend it to others, a very happy purchase.</li>
    <li> Please pay attention to the 4th photo and drag your mouse to the edge of the veil and you will see how the &amp;#34;lace&amp;#34; is applied to the tulle, it is very obvious and more in person, I wish I had done that. I was very skeptical about buying it but since it was only $7+ and free shipping I decided to give it a try. It&#x27;s going to the garbage! I ordered the Veil on 2/28 and it arrived on 4/2, very long time.</li>
    <li> It was white not ivory</li>
    <li> It depends on your taste but its more edge embroidered and not as pciture to me. It did not come with a Comb. I thought it did. shorted than stated. I brought it for someone and i hope she likes it because I did not.</li>
    <li> looks so nice on picture, but mine is very poorly made, and it came in dirty, so disatisfied, but i&#x27;ve made peace with it, is not worth me stressing  over!</li>
    <li> Loved it. simple yet elegant</li>
    <li> This veil is unmourned and I love it! I hadn&#x27;t decided whether I wanted a blusher or not, but this gorgeous veil gave me the flexibility to mount it myself. I absolutely love the delicate fabric, and I will be purchasing another for \\&quot;just in case\\&quot; purposes for at the wedding. Overall, beautiful veil and so very nicely priced! This was simply stunning and will go perfectly with my ivory empire waist Aline dress.</li>
    <li> I thought it was too good to be true when I purchased this veil for around $8.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it did take some time to ship (about 7 weeks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received it though I was so impressed with the detailing at the bottom and the quality of the veil. I went to my local craft store and bought a clear hair comb and some jewels. I fitted the veil how I wanted it to hang and sewed it to the comb. I then Sewed the jewels over that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had so many compliments on my veil. I even stumped the bridal shop where I bought my gown. They had almost identical veils there for upwards of $400! I paid $14 for mine when all was said and done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a crafty side and want a quality veil, this is the way to go!</li>
    <li> This is cheap. It is shaped like a table cloth. A rectangle with rounded corners. And you can see where the lace and tulle meet. because the tulle actually come out past the lace trim. Which can be fixed with some scissors. Still disappointing.</li>
    <li> Very pretty. We had our seamstress attach a comb.</li>
    <li> It was just a piece of netting with lace. We added our own comb and for less tthan 15 dollars we had a beautiful veil. Unfortunately it takes over a month to arrive, so order early.</li>
    <li> I used this for my wedding, but I did modify it by sewing on a clip.</li>
    <li> I am very please with the veil, it is much prettier in person. I wasn&#x27;t aware of it coming from China, so if you need it fast make sure you order it at least 30 days before. (you need it)  I received it a couple days shy from a month. I did email the sender questioning the mail out date and the sender did reply back promptly. I bought the veil &amp; hair comb separate and paid someone about $15.00 bucks to put it together. I have not yet worn the veil yet but I am very pleased with what I have purchased.</li>
    <li> Just got this in the mail two weeks early! And it is BEAUTIFUL! So very much cheaper than the ones I had previously looked at. All you need, is a hair comb put in if you order it. I HIGHLY recommend!</li>
    <li> They sent me the wrong color. Then suggested I was wrong and told me to send them pictures. So I did. They then sent me a new one that was in fact actually ivory, but it was so incredibly cheap. I would say this should only be about 4$</li>
    <li> The veil could have been sewn better......it was rectangle and the lace was attached carelessly.&lt;br /&gt;I will probably purchase something else and maybe use this as a tablecloth.</li>
    <li> no combs or clips which is exactly what we wanted for my daughter&#x27;s wedding.  The ivory is quite pale, almost white, the tulle is very fine, and the lace has a soft sheen to it.  We pinned this into her hair on both sides of her up-do asymetrically and it was so lovely she kept it on through the reception and the after-party.  The effect was so unique a couple at the after-party venue asked her who had custom-made her veil.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Stuck comb right through- beautiful! Received so many compliments!</li>
    <li> i did not like this veil because it didnt come with the comb and look jack up. but with my skills i can make this veil look amazing so thanks</li>
    <li> Photo doesn&#x27;t do it justice. It is really beautiful and matches my David&#x27;s Bridal Ivory Tulle perfectly. Almost as if it was cut from the same fabric. Bridal salons charge way too much. This is price is CHEAP for the product. It doesn&#x27;t come with a comb but you could purchase one or just pin it into hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my Wedding Sadly it was the wrong color. It was beautiful but looked like it had cheap material and poor workmanship.I order a ivory and ended up with a white one. I was really looking forward to wearing this. It did arrived on time which is all I was really happy about with this purchase. I would not order again. You will also need a comb to be able to wear this veil.</li>
    <li> I did not pay much so I&#x27;m not too upset, but I would caution buyers against buying this product. It looks like an oblong piece of fish netting with a ribbon on it.</li>
    <li> I love it. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Have to add in comb and its applique not embroidery but for the price its a deal.. Better than paying a fortune at the bridal stores for something people only see for short period of time.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t reached the date yet but seems to match the description and pic given. Guess I&#x27;ll let you know more after worn</li>
    <li> gorgeous! best buy I could&#x27;ve ever made. got it super fast in great shape exactly how it was described! cant wait to wear it!</li>
    <li> Quality of veil was not what I expected. It was very poor and not well done. I got what I paid for. The time arrival was on time and fast.</li>
    <li> The quality of this veil is as I expected.  It&#x27;s a bit cheap-looking with some loose threads.  I ordered this as a backup veil since my wedding is this July and I have a friend who is hand-decorating one for me.  I recommend any bride have a backup veil, because you never know!  With careful placement I&#x27;m sure this veil will be fine.  Sure beats paying over 100.00 at a bridal store!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed. It did not look anything like the picture. Poorly made and sloppy stitching on the trim. I had to take the material cut it up and make my own from it.</li>
    <li> This Veil is ok if you aren&#x27;t looking for perfect. It&#x27;s cheap and that&#x27;s what you pay for. The sewing isn&#x27;t the best, but it is ok for me. I trimmed the threads off and it looks pretty.</li>
    <li> I was so pleased when this arrived. Although, I was a little distraught by how it was shipped. It arrived folded, in a tiny cellophane bag and crammed into a bubble wrap envelope. After hanging it up in the closet for a few days, all the wrinkle came out, and I am very pleased with t. it will go beautifully with the cocktail hat I ordered for my rockabilly wedding.</li>
    <li> I was hoping it would be a little better quality than what it turned out to be. I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have mentioned... it&#x27;s kind of cheapish, and has some frayed edges.  But nothing that couldn&#x27;t be fixed.  My wife loved it on our wedding day. :)</li>
    <li> I would give it zero stars but it won&#x27;t let me. This was horribly done! It looks nothing like the picture!!! Do not purchase! I guess I get what I paid for even though it was not what the picture or the description said!</li>
    <li> The veil does not look anything like it does in the picture and has a really funky smell. You get what you pay for.... :/</li>
    <li> Already shared this with another upcoming bride</li>
    <li> Very poorly made very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Good price and fast shipping. For the money you won&#x27;t be dissapponted. This is pretty and I look forward to seeing my new bride wear it.</li>
    <li> Great on time!! I mean really for the money and for the amount of time your going to wear it... it is great!</li>
    <li> It was white, not ivory.  And looks just  like a round table cloth, no comb and looked nothing like a veil.  It will be cute on the cake table though.</li>
    <li> Cheap, Cheap , Cheap and it looks that way!</li>
    <li> Very pretty and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I got so many compliments on this. Be aware there is no comb in it but I paid a bridal shop $20 to put a comb in it so you are still saving money and it was the perfect length (to my elbows) like I wanted.</li>
    <li> Not really ivory , seem more white . Not impress with it at all, seem cheap . But it&#x27;s ok otherwise . Only gonna wear it for a little bit so I can deal with it .</li>
