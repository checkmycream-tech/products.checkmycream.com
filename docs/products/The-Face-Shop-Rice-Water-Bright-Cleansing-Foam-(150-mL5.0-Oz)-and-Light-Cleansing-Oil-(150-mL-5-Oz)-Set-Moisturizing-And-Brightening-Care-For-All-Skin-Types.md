      <li>Much better than DHC oil cleanser at lower price.</li>
      <li>On top of the ultra-sensitivity, it is also acne prone.</li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>I works even faster than the MAC oil and rinses very clean, no residue at all.</li>
      <li>The shipment was quick and the products amazing.</li>
      <li>love the cleansing oil, melts my makeup right off but a 4 star because the cleansing foam wasn&#x27;t just as amazing as the oil.</li>
      <li>Light, but it does better job in removing make-up.  </li>
      <li>They both have a light scent that I love.</li>
      <li>The oil has a strong, but pleasant, fragrance, however it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin like most fragrances do.  </li>
      <li>I was so pleased to receive the item so quickly.</li>
      <li>This smells awesome and works great as a duo to get off all my make up, though the foaming cleanser has a bit higher of a pH than I would normally want and is a little drying because of it.</li>
      <li>I used my clarasonic with it and my skin is smooth like a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
      <li>The oil cleanser is really really good and leaves face soft and feeling cleansed without oily feeling in the eyes.  </li>
      <li>These products were both highly recommended and I am so glad that I bought both of them!  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!!!</li>

      <li>I can tell a significant difference when using these two cleansers.</li>
      <li>It gets make up off well and is SUPER light on your skin.</li>
      <li>but it will clean your face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>my face always feels clean.</li>
      <li>I have tried a lot of products and this one is the right fit for my skin type.</li>
      <li>The foam is gentle and leaves my face feeling very clean.</li>
      <li>I like this because it means I won&#x27;t run out too quickly.</li>
      <li>Anyway, I didn&#x27;t particularly relish the idea of putting salad dressing on my face and this is definitely more</li>
      <li>Also, I have mild rosacea and this does not bother that.</li>
      <li>The product really good, not make your face skin dry after wash.</li>
      <li>/&gt;First things first, let&#x27;s talk about my skin so you can understand why I love these products so much.</li>
      <li>use one-two squirts of oil to clean my face first</li>
      <li>and I really like how light they are</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> AMAZING! I normally use shiseido and I can say this does the same thing for half the price. The smell of the oil is beautiful and the cream wash is very light, and a little goes a long way. So in all it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> This is my second order for the cleaning oil. Love it! Improved my skin. I have very oily, acne prone skin with dark acne scars. This does not add oil to your skin. This melts all your make up off your face. With my waterproof !mascara, I add a dab on a cottonball and it easily wipes off!  Face wash was VERY foamy and soft on my skin. I used my clarasonic with it and my skin is smooth like a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
    <li> These products are amazing. The cleansing oil takes off every bit of make up and leaves my skin very soft. The foam is gentle and leaves my face feeling very clean. They both have a light scent that I love. I use the foam in the morning and both in the evening. I have very fair, mildly sensitive skin but haven&#x27;t had a problem with these.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST cleansing combo I&#x27;ve ever purchased!  Being a clean skin junkie, I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of cleansers throughout the years, both cheap drugstore brands, as well as high end brands I spent a fortune on - some I threw in the garbage in disgust, some I liked, but nothing ever worked so well that I stopped looking for something better. I have extremely oily, yet sensitive skin, prone to blemishes, with noticeable pores. I think I&#x27;ve finally found my best cleansing routine. The first step oil cleanser is very light, non-greasy, and highly effective in melting off all the makeup without irritating my face. It is not unscented, but the subtle, light scent is actually nice! The second step is the foam cleanser which has a smooth, velvety texture I absolutely love. It is mild, yet lathers beautifully, and cleans off everything, leaving my face squeaky clean. After any other cleanser, I used to see some leftover makeup residue or dirt on my cotton ball when I apply toner. After cleansing with this set, there was NONE of that! The price is reasonable too. Give it a try, I bet you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I love love this product</li>
    <li> After years of hassling with different products constantly trying to find the right one for my skin, I&#x27;m done.  This is it.  I have dry, very sensitive skin, get break outs all the time, mild rosacea breakouts on tops of cheeks, and can&#x27;t keep a regulated moisture level in my face, especially cheek area, no matter how much or little moisturizer I put on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this on a whim, and am SO happy I did.  The oil has a strong, but pleasant, fragrance, however it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin like most fragrances do.  The cream cleaner has only a very very light scent to it, can hardly notice it.  A little bit of product goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use one-two squirts of oil to clean my face first (it gets mascara off easily if it isn&#x27;t water proof, but oils irritate my eyes so I only used it for this once).. then I follow up with a pearl size squirt of the cream cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had perfectly clear, calm, bright, younger looking skin ever since the first night of using these two products.  No irritations, no dryness, no redness, no breakouts!  I&#x27;ve started to get a couple hormonal breakouts-but after cleansing with these two products they are mostly gone by the following morning.  Holy Grail status!!</li>
    <li> Love the foam. The oil isnt bad</li>
    <li> I love the cleansing oil.</li>
    <li> The product really good, not make your face skin dry after wash.</li>
    <li> I love The Face Shop! I use about 1-2 pumps of the cleansing oil (this helps remove a lot of the makeup I wasn&#x27;t able to get off with The Face Shop Cleansing Tissue). Next, I use the cleaning foam...you need only a pea size amount as a little goes a long way. Lather and rinse...my face always feels clean. I&#x27;ve been using both products for over a month and have noticed my skin is brighter.</li>
    <li> I have been a devout MAC Cleanse Off Oil makeup remover for years. I decided to give this set a try and I am in LOVE! The oil works so well and has a nice light fragrance. It has a watery consistency but once applied to your face (dry) it dissolves all makeup (even waterproof mascara). I works even faster than the MAC oil and rinses very clean, no residue at all. I followed up with the cream cleanser. It lathers very nice and only a dime sized amount is needed. It washes off easily and leaves your skin soft, supple and is non-drying. I LOVE this set and will be repurchasing for myself as well as gifts for friends/family.</li>
    <li> Okay, the cleansing foam defintily dries out combination oily and acne prone faces. I dont think i would use that everyday. Plus, i read that cleansing foams aren&#x27;t good for your face unfortunately because it dries it out and leaves your pores open for bacteria. So, i sorta regretted buying this set after i researched about cleansing foams. I dont think people should completely stay away from foam cleansers but don&#x27;t use them often. I mean, I&#x27;m not gonna use the cleasning foam every day, probably just like every other 2 or 3 days before bed. The cleansing oil is completely worth using every day to be honest though! But mostly to get make up off. You should always follow up with a gel cleanser after using it cause i remember a couple youtubers reviewing it and saying that the oil-base product can cause acne. It gets make up off well and is SUPER light on your skin. I&#x27;d defintily use it when i get home from school or work and then follow up with my regular night skin routine. It really gets the grime and make up off and It makes your skin really soft! Hope that helps :)</li>
    <li> The rice water works really well, but the wash clogged my pores</li>
    <li> The shipment was quick and the products amazing.</li>
    <li> My face feel clean and soft</li>
    <li> So far so good! I&#x27;ve had these items for about a week and I really like how light they are</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d bought these after reading about the oil cleansing method on Reddit&#x27;s Asian Beauty thread. I&#x27;m not Asian but the Asian approach to beauty is to have clear, toned natural skin, as opposed to covering it all in makeup. Anyway, I didn&#x27;t particularly relish the idea of putting salad dressing on my face and this is definitely more refined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is a little watery so when dispensing be sure to cup your hand and not spritz it on your fingers because it&#x27;ll just spill everywhere. It got all of my makeup off perfectly. The foaming wash is amazing! You only need the tiniest bit and there is so much luxurious foaming lather! I like this because it means I won&#x27;t run out too quickly. Both these products have a nice light scent. Not overpowering at all, just...pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So happy I found this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been to Sephora and have noticed the growing Korean skin care trend, but the cost always seemed out of reach.  This affordable skin care line from Korea seemed worth a try.  I&#x27;ve also been intrigued with the concept of oil cleansers.  I&#x27;m happy to report that this skin care set works great!  I find the scent to be nice and I use the oil to loosen my make up at the end of the day followed by the cleanser to wash it all away.  And the best part is that it doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out and I have VERY sensitive skin.  I will definitely be buying again and I am excited to try some other Face Shop products.</li>
    <li> The oil is an excellent first step in the cleansing process. However, the cream is very high ph and strips my skin of all its moisture. I think it might&#x27;ve also been the culprit of my cystic acne breakout.</li>
    <li> I purchased these products because I have read great things about Face Shop products. I wanted to get an oil cleanser and I can across this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally have normal to dry skin. I wear liquid eyeliner and mascara everyday but I am too lazy to remove my makeup before showering. I use this set instead and it removes all my makeup without a problem! After I wash my face I use a toner to get rid of any excess makeup but there is nothing on the cotton pad because these products are so good at removing everything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this my face feels so fresh and moisturized. I can tell a significant difference when using these two cleansers. My face glows when I get out of the shower and is brighter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would highly recommend using these two items especially if you have dry skin like me!</li>
    <li> good in general but feels a little greasy....if you have very dry skin this may be good for you, otherwise stay away....</li>
    <li> The combo is very good on skin. Not drying and clean my face really good. Doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
    <li> This is awesome product.. Love it</li>
    <li> This smells awesome and works great as a duo to get off all my make up, though the foaming cleanser has a bit higher of a pH than I would normally want and is a little drying because of it. I adore the oil, though, and even if I don&#x27;t buy them together again I think I&#x27;ll continue use of it.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser set!  Much better than DHC oil cleanser at lower price. Light, but it does better job in removing make-up.  It lasts long time,too. I still have the bottle that I got 6 months ago. The cream ceanser is great on its own when i dont wear much make-up.</li>
    <li> I was so pleased to receive the item so quickly. The is exellent and i am enjoying it  so far</li>
    <li> love. love. love the cleansing oil, melts my makeup right off but a 4 star because the cleansing foam wasn&#x27;t just as amazing as the oil.</li>
    <li> The cleansing oil really helps with makeup removal and the face wash leaves my skin feeling really soft. It also brightens up my skin. I don&#x27;t think I saw any improvements to my acne though.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of products and this one is the right fit for my skin type. I am beyond pleased.</li>
    <li> Feels good on my face,cleans good great for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Both are good products for me. The oil seems more of a gentle daily cleanser. I think the foam is more of a deep gentle cleanser. I would use the foam maybe once or twice a week or in the t zone area as I have sensitive cheeks/slight rosacea.</li>
    <li> Skin Type: Oily, Acne prone, and sensitive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First things first, let&#x27;s talk about my skin so you can understand why I love these products so much. My skin is very sensitive, to the point where neutrogena products make it burn. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s carried in the US and is for sensitive skin or labeled gentle you can bet that I&#x27;ve tried. On top of the ultra-sensitivity, it is also acne prone. This means that the things I&#x27;ve tried that don&#x27;t make my skin burn often lead to break outs. I&#x27;ve been through 2 rounds of accutane in my youth to get my acne to even be managable. Acne products tend to make my acne flare even after prolonged use(i.e. at least a month). To top off the trifecta, my skin is also oily. It isn&#x27;t oily from overuse of acne products either; my skin routine only has a spot treatment in it to treat acne when it appears now a days. In the morning, I cleanse with a gentle foaming cleanser by creating a lather with a foaming net, pat my skin dry and then use a toner without alcohol. After that, I moisturize with a light moisturizer unless my skin feels dry, then I have a heavier one, followed by eye cream. At night, I take off my eye make-up, then use an oil cleanser to remove the rest of my make-up. Then I use a foaming cleanser, toner, and night time moisturizer. Every other day I use a mask, either a clay mask or a sheet mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the good stuff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alone, these are great products. The Oil cleanser melts make-up off your skin. I some lovely redness across my cheeks and when I swiped the oil across then it instantly was uncovered. Note: this is not because of any reaction just my natural skin tone. It rinses off easily unlike other oil cleansers I have used in the past. The foam cleanser is gentle and thorough. My face feels squeaky clean but not dry which is a plus. It only takes about a pea size to cleanse your whole face if you use a foaming net to produce the lather. My skin has never had a bad reaction to these nor has it broken out from these products. My monthly hormonal ones still happen but this is by far the first cleanser I have ever used that has met _all_ of my skin&#x27;s concerns. I hope this helps in your decision to try them. :3</li>
    <li> Really glad I ordered this cleanser.  The oil cleanser is really really good and leaves face soft and feeling cleansed without oily feeling in the eyes.  The foam cleaner is equally as good for a deeper foam cleanse.  So glad I found these.  Will be ordering again</li>
    <li> I love the rice oIL makeup remover. The wash wash is really good too. The wash smells really nice.</li>
    <li> Although I do not see the brightening effects of this product, however the cleansing foam does clean dirt and oil off from the face very well without drying it. The cleansing oil is also very good in removing stubborn eye and face makeup. This product is worth the buy. It&#x27;s a great value.</li>
    <li> I am a very recent Korean Skin Care convert.  I watched endless vlogs on Youtube and looked at beauty blogs not only for the routine but also for some product recommendations.  These products were both highly recommended and I am so glad that I bought both of them!  They have a mild scent that is not intrusive but is actually very pleasant.  I look forward to the scent now, actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light Cleansing Oil:&lt;br /&gt;I use this to get the makeup off my face.  If I do not wear makeup on that particular day, I don&#x27;t use it.  I never understood the concept behind removing oil-based products with an oil cleansing method but it works!  I do have to say that you will have to use a different eye makeup remover especially if you wear stubborn mascara like I do.  I actually prefer to saturate my eyes with coconut oil which I melt between my fingers, cover with a moist cotton pad for about a minute and then gently wipe the makeup off.  After I do that, I squirt one or two pumps of the cleansing oil onto my palms and apply to my face, adding a tiny bit of water to get it to emulsify.  It&#x27;s not really going to lather but it will clean your face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foaming Cleanser:&lt;br /&gt;I think that this is, hands down, my favorite Korean skincare product at the moment (with the Laneige sleeping mask coming close second).  It only takes a tiny, baby pea amount on your hand, press together to lather and then gently transfer the lather to your wet face.  It feels so luxurious and leaves the skin clean but still soft!  A little goes a long way so this will be lasting me a while!  Since using both of these products along with the other steps to my skin care routine, my complexion has significantly improved in brightness and texture and I no longer suffer from dry, uneven spots on my face!</li>
    <li> I love this combo set. I use the oil at night, and it literally melts my makeup off with minimal effort. I just rub it on my skin in small circles and then gently around my eyes, then runs with warm water and follow it up with the foam. In the morning I only use the foam. I love how the foam feels on my skin. It&#x27;s so soft and fluffy and feels luxurious. There isn&#x27;t much of a smell, it&#x27;s sort of a subtle baby smell. This does not irritate my super sensitive skin. Also, I have mild rosacea and this does not bother that.</li>
    <li> Great products!! Cleansing oil melts all the make up and leaves skin feels so soft and clean. Cleansing form is very gentle and leaves skin feels clean and soft. They are both very gentle to your skin and brightens skin as well. I used expensive cleansing oil for many years and I love this products much better. Highly recommend!!!!</li>
    <li> Nice and light.  Lathers well, only need a little.  Nice smell too!</li>
