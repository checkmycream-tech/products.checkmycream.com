      <li>Both of them love the smell, plus I loved the price....</li>
      <li>It has a strong but pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>The bottle is adorable.</li>
      <li>I do actually Love this scent.</li>
      <li>of the top of the bottle comes off and can be worn as a ring too.</li>
      <li>I love the scent.</li>
      <li>And the bottle is precious so</li>
      <li>Its EDT, which is mostly water :</li>
      <li>I just love this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice sweet feminine fragrance.</li>
      <li>Nice size bottle and arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>Light , refreshing, love it.</li>
      <li>Its such a nice smell and a great price on amazon</li>
      <li>To me this feels like the original Princess with a fresh, bright twist.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy this perfume though I wouldn&#x27;t call it my favorite.</li>
      <li>I feel that the smell is light and wearable for anyone.</li>
      <li>The longevity on this is great, I get all day wear with moderate sillage.</li>
      <li>Looks cheap.  </li>
      <li>This smells fantastic</li>
      <li>Definitely worth a try!</li>
      <li>But it came right in time!</li>
      <li>Some people find this to be a masculine/unisex scent because of the cedar but on my skin the fruitiness keeps the woods sweet and gourmand.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a light fun fragrance.</li>
      <li>I agree with the previous review that this stuff is great</li>
      <li>but it does not last more than maybe 3 hours then needs to be reapplied.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>It seems to last most of the day.</li>
      <li>This might be more appropriate for daytime/office wear than the original due to being less sweet and gourmand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>stop me and tell me how good I smelled; she asked what the fragrance was and actually stopped me the next time I saw her to saw she went out and bought it for herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They smell ridiculously good and they last throughout the entire day.</li>
      <li>It does not last long, nice because its really that light.</li>
      <li>I really like this line of fragrances.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very feminine and sexy, but it unfortunately does not have good lasting power.</li>
      <li>The cedar  and guava are most prominent initially and the creamy marshmallow reminiscent of the original version comes out in the dry down.</li>
      <li>I can layer it easily with other scents  or on itself.</li>
      <li>The perfume had been opened previously and most likely sprayed by someone.</li>

<li> The fruity/wood scent dissipates after several hours leaving the amber, marshmallow, and honey notes behind for the rest of the day.</li>
<li> Im not sure</li>
<li> I literally had random people stopping me on the train, in the store, etc.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll put it on like crazy in the morning</li>
<li> I bought this close to Christmas and was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t come by then.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s so disappointing!</li>

    <li> Nice size bottle and arrived quickly. The scent is wonderful and made a wonderful gift. Will purchase again for another birthday gift.</li>
    <li> Great for the day! It does smell really good and it&#x27;s a light fun fragrance. And the bottle is precious so +A to this.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter and she just loves it...it her all time favorite!</li>
    <li> Beautiful fragrance! I just love this. I can layer it easily with other scents  or on itself. It seems to last most of the day. I feel that the smell is light and wearable for anyone. Definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> I agree with the previous review that this stuff is great but it just doesn&#x27;t last! I don&#x27;t know what the other person is experiencing. I&#x27;ll put it on like crazy in the morning and then two hours later it&#x27;s just gone. It&#x27;s so disappointing! If only it lasted longer!</li>
    <li> I bought this close to Christmas and was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t come by then. But it came right in time!</li>
    <li> my favorite perfume and at a great price. I was so surprised to see how big the bottle was and for half the price in the mall I am really happy</li>
    <li> I love the scent. It does not last long, nice because its really that light.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I thought it would be. Very elegant perfume. Can be worn by any one. Light , refreshing, love it.</li>
    <li> The perfume bottles box was not sealed. The perfume had been opened previously and most likely sprayed by someone. Im not sure if they just sold me a tester or how it came to not be wrapped in cellophane.</li>
    <li> The Verga Wang Princess fragrances all rock! They smell ridiculously good and they last throughout the entire day. I literally had random people stopping me on the train, in the store, etc. just to tell me how good I smelled. I even had a girl in the gym stop me and tell me how good I smelled; she asked what the fragrance was and actually stopped me the next time I saw her to saw she went out and bought it for herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great fragrance, great price on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Yum! This smells fantastic</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for years I love it! Its such a nice smell and a great price on amazon</li>
    <li> This fragrance is too floral for my taste so I ended up giving it to my Mom who loves floral scents (she usuallly gets most of my blind buy fragrances :/ )</li>
    <li> I do actually Love this scent. It&#x27;s very feminine and sexy, but it unfortunately does not have good lasting power. I find on myself it lasts like, 4 to 5 hours? Give or take :/&lt;br /&gt;but I do like the scent. It&#x27;s very nice.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this perfume though I wouldn&#x27;t call it my favorite. It has a strong but pleasant smell. A little bit goes a long way. The bottle is adorable. I could see myself possibly buying it again once I run out.</li>
    <li> Looks cheap.  Smells cheaper. Had I investigated the manufacturer of this aggressive  fragrance, I would have passed.  It&#x27;s has a &amp;#34; grandma-esque&amp;#34; scent. Nothing about this fragrance is princess-y.</li>
    <li> I loove the fragrance, but for the price, no way! Its EDT, which is mostly water :(.&lt;br /&gt;Im not paying $50 for scented water. Also an EDT doesnt last long, always have to reapply a few times a day.&lt;br /&gt;If i could get this in an EDP (Eue De Parfum), OMG i would buy bottles of it.&lt;br /&gt;Can never find it in stores...ever.</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my two granddaughters for Christmas.  Both of them love the smell, plus I loved the price....</li>
    <li> I love this spray!! It&#x27;s a nice sweet feminine fragrance. I am likely to purchase again. I really like this line of fragrances.</li>
    <li> To me this feels like the original Princess with a fresh, bright twist. The cedar  and guava are most prominent initially and the creamy marshmallow reminiscent of the original version comes out in the dry down. Some people find this to be a masculine/unisex scent because of the cedar but on my skin the fruitiness keeps the woods sweet and gourmand. The longevity on this is great, I get all day wear with moderate sillage. The fruity/wood scent dissipates after several hours leaving the amber, marshmallow, and honey notes behind for the rest of the day. This might be more appropriate for daytime/office wear than the original due to being less sweet and gourmand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of the top of the bottle comes off and can be worn as a ring too. Very cute!</li>
    <li> this princess doesn&#x27;t rule my kingdom - I do like this one enough but it does not last more than maybe 3 hours then needs to be reapplied.</li>
