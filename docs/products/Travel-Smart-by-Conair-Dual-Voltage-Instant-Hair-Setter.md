      <li>Just took these on vacation...very convenient,fits in the luggage easily and does a wonderful job.</li>
      <li>She was very satisfied with the size of the set as well as how they worked.</li>
      <li>I needed more medium rollers to make the set work for me.  </li>
      <li>These rollers are outstanding and travel so well.</li>
      <li>They do not take up much space, heat up quickly and develop a beautiful curl in my hair that holds.</li>
      <li>That is a nice feature when you are in a rush and the rollers have gotten too hot.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t recommend if you have fine hair.</li>
      <li>The travel case is great, however, not enough curlers</li>
      <li>The clips that come with the rollers will not hold them securely in your hair.  </li>
      <li>They heat up fast and make wonderful curls that last all day.</li>
      <li>I am so pleased with this hot roller set.  </li>
      <li>I will continue to travel with my standard set which has my favorite 1 1/4 size rollers, removing of course the top transparent lid which never fails to crack as it goes through luggage handling in an airport.</li>
      <li>Most important to know before purchasing is the actual size of the rollers.  </li>
      <li>There are plenty of rollers for any hairstyle and they heat up very fast.</li>
      <li>Compact size fits nicely in carry on luggage.&lt;br /&gt;Heats up quickly and has enough curlers for a complete cover up</li>
      <li>Thanks Conair!</li>
      <li>These come in a nice little package for travel that I like very much.</li>
      <li>I did like the travel smart.  </li>
      <li>I did like the travel smart Conair Heat Setter.  </li>
      <li>The clips hold the curlers in place nice and tight so the rollers aren&#x27;t sliding around on my head.</li>
      <li>So it really doesn&#x27;t meet my needs.</li>
      <li>Pins to hold them in also don&#x27;t work too well, curlers fall out if you walk around fast, which I tend to do while getting ready to leave house.  </li>
      <li>Did not heat very well.</li>
      <li>Just used this on a trip to Europe and it was much better than expected.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this set highly</li>
      <li>It does not get hot enough to curl my hair.  </li>
      <li>My biggest issue is that they just don&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
      <li>You must leave the curlers in for at least 15-20 minutes, but it worked well for my fine, straight hair.</li>
      <li>My wife tried them a couple times but they did not heat enough to do much so they were discarded.</li>
      <li>it would have been nice to get at least one extra clip with this...</li>
      <li>It cools down quickly, too.</li>
      <li>I have long hair and this set really works well.  </li>
      <li>The rollers do not get hot enough to curl your hair no matter how long you let them heat.  </li>

<li> The rollers do not get hot enough to curl your hair no matter how long you let them heat.  </li>
<li> found the rollers do indeed get hot enough, not only at the base but all throughout the roller, top to bottom.  </li>
<li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit has spindles which fit either size of roller - no need to place small rollers on small spindles and medium rollers on medium size ones.</li>
<li> Very efficient and is small and convenient for travel as it takes up little rooml - bought a second one for my sister</li>
<li> Curlers don&#x27;t heat well, take a long time and then not very hot.  </li>
<li> They take a little while to heat up which I can deal with, but there is just not enough heat to put curl in my hair.</li>
<li> If you have a standard  set of rollers, you are probably used to 3/4 being very small, possibly unusable.  </li>
<li> The only weird thing is that the rollers really aren&#x27;t round.</li>
<li> The roller are a little smaller than what I use at home and did not have the flocking on them which made a little difference in the way the set turned out.  </li>
<li> inch rollers a bit too tight for me</li>
<li> Was a waste of money and space taking them on my trip.</li>
<li> rollers are heavy.</li>
<li> I got them for travel, but I would use them for everyday as well.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure what that does, per se, to the curl.</li>

    <li> Curlers don&#x27;t heat well, take a long time and then not very hot.  Pins to hold them in also don&#x27;t work too well, curlers fall out if you walk around fast, which I tend to do while getting ready to leave house.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife before our vacation. She was very satisfied with the size of the set as well as how they worked.</li>
    <li> I saw this in one of the travel brochures, but more expensive.  This dual watt curler works great!  The way the curler is constructed (with the spokes), I don&#x27;t even need plastic clips in addition to the wire clips &#x3D; they stay on with just the wire clips.</li>
    <li> These rollers are outstanding and travel so well. There are plenty of rollers for any hairstyle and they heat up very fast.</li>
    <li> The rollers do not get hot enough to curl your hair no matter how long you let them heat.  The clips that come with the rollers will not hold them securely in your hair.  I have returned them.</li>
    <li> I did like the travel smart Conair Heat Setter.  The roller are a little smaller than what I use at home and did not have the flocking on them which made a little difference in the way the set turned out.  I did like the travel smart.  It was small and convenient for travel!</li>
    <li> It does not get hot enough to curl my hair.  Also there are really not enough rollers.  I shouldn&#x27;t have bought this item.</li>
    <li> Compact size fits nicely in carry on luggage.&lt;br /&gt;Heats up quickly and has enough curlers for a complete cover up</li>
    <li> rollers are heavy. there weren&#x27;t enough clips---or enough rollers for that matter. hard to stay rolled on my head. I returned them.</li>
    <li> Did not heat very well. My wife tried them a couple times but they did not heat enough to do much so they were discarded.</li>
    <li> Giving them to Goodwill. Curl didn&#x27;t hold. Was a waste of money and space taking them on my trip.</li>
    <li> The travel case is great, however, not enough curlers and they didn&#x27;t stay in my hair even with the clips. Clips were hard to use also. Don&#x27;t recommend if you have fine hair.</li>
    <li> This set is the perfect one. I have others in the closet. This is the best one.  It is perfect for travel.</li>
    <li> I needed more medium rollers to make the set work for me.  I sent a check for $10 to Conair for extra rollers on 1/5/13.  The check has been cashed.  Today I received 8 replacement clips---no rollers.  So it really doesn&#x27;t meet my needs.</li>
    <li> These come in a nice little package for travel that I like very much. The clips hold the curlers in place nice and tight so the rollers aren&#x27;t sliding around on my head. My biggest issue is that they just don&#x27;t get hot enough. They take a little while to heat up which I can deal with, but there is just not enough heat to put curl in my hair. I&#x27;m going to try and find another brand and I&#x27;ll just keep these as a back up.</li>
    <li> Just used this on a trip to Europe and it was much better than expected. You must leave the curlers in for at least 15-20 minutes, but it worked well for my fine, straight hair.</li>
    <li> They heat up fast and make wonderful curls that last all day. I got them for travel, but I would use them for everyday as well.</li>
    <li> Just took these on vacation...very convenient,fits in the luggage easily and does a wonderful job. I would recommend this set highly</li>
    <li> I like to have a selection of roller size- not just one size. This one packs well in a suitcase. The only weird thing is that the rollers really aren&#x27;t round. They feel like triangles. I&#x27;m not sure what that does, per se, to the curl. It cools down quickly, too. That is a nice feature when you are in a rush and the rollers have gotten too hot.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this hot roller set.  It is so lightweight I hardly know it&#x27;s in my luggage.  And...the curls I get&lt;br /&gt;are just beautiful.  I have long hair and this set really works well.  Thanks Conair!</li>
    <li> Most important to know before purchasing is the actual size of the rollers.  In this travel set, \\&quot;large\\&quot; rollers are 1 inch.  The \\&quot;medium\\&quot; rollers are 3/4 inch.  If you have a standard  set of rollers, you are probably used to 3/4 being very small, possibly unusable.  Depends on your hair style I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit has spindles which fit either size of roller - no need to place small rollers on small spindles and medium rollers on medium size ones. One size spindle fits all.  This is an advantage if you want to travel with ALL 1-inch size.  You can buy one unit and then purchase additional rollers by filling in the replacement order form that comes in the box.  Conair will sell you three 1 inch size rollers for $6.00 plus $1.00 postage/handling. For $14 you can have enough 1 inch rollers to replace the 3/4 in the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the rollers do indeed get hot enough, not only at the base but all throughout the roller, top to bottom.  You may have to let them heat for about 10 minutes, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 inch rollers a bit too tight for me so I will have to return the unit.  I will continue to travel with my standard set which has my favorite 1 1/4 size rollers, removing of course the top transparent lid which never fails to crack as it goes through luggage handling in an airport.</li>
    <li> Heats and curls well. Like it&#x27;s compact size.</li>
    <li> Prefect for my needs at home and away.</li>
    <li> it would have been nice to get at least one extra clip with this... ALso, it appears that there&#x27;s no difference in the quality or performance compared to curlers I&#x27;ve had for 20 years...</li>
    <li> These curlers are awesome. They do not take up much space, heat up quickly and develop a beautiful curl in my hair that holds.</li>
    <li> Very efficient and is small and convenient for travel as it takes up little rooml - bought a second one for my sister</li>
