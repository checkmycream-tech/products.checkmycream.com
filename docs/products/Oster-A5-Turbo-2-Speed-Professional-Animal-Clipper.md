      <li>It is an awesome clipper!</li>
      <li>Best to take breaks with it.</li>
      <li>If you want the best that Oster has to offer?</li>
      <li>Works perfectly.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
      <li>I was impressed with the effortless shaving and shedding of hair from the trimmer.  </li>
      <li>They run and work great.</li>
      <li>love these they are awesome and do a great job</li>
      <li>Two speed is also good at times.</li>
      <li>POWER WISE</li>
      <li>Spare set of motor brushes, oil and cleaning brush was a good touch.</li>
      <li>Love the 2 speeds, can&#x27;t beat oysters, great clipper, I would recommend to everyone.  </li>
      <li>and I found that it is much superior to many of it&#x27;s competitors.</li>
      <li>I saw a chrome one and liked it ordered it</li>
      <li>I use these to clip my cats its a very good trimmer however it can get pretty warm with longer use.</li>
      <li>but I fell in love.</li>
      <li>My cheaper Wal-Mart Clippers worked better.</li>
      <li>The Oster A5 Turbo 2 Speed did more than meet my expectations.  </li>
      <li>OKAY</li>
      <li>Is,ok im a master barber I had so many clippers in my hands so this clipper by oster is just like the 76 by oster</li>
      <li>The trimmer had the power to slice through some of the thicker spots and did so leaving a nice clean cut in it&#x27;s path.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s working great except it gets hot too quick like in 5 mins.</li>
      <li>fyi Keep the clipper blade lubricated with a quality light oil</li>
      <li>Cuts smoothly and evenly.  </li>
      <li>IT GETS HOT VERY QUICKLY.</li>
      <li>While using it the very first day it stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>But I did drop them already and they make a funny sound.</li>
      <li>I use to cut human hair, but the high speed would work great for animal hair.  </li>
      <li>The goats placed 1st and 2nd in their respective divisions and our 4 year old took Grand Champion; I credit her blood for that but having a nice clean shave didn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
      <li>I spent a lot of money on different brands and out of all the ones I&#x27;ve used so far, this was the best!</li>
      <li>it got hot in 1 minute</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t get hot either.</li>
      <li>They do get a little warm in my hand</li>
      <li>cause you really dont need it .and</li>
      <li>I bought this recently after so many expensive grooming bills for my Great Pyrenees.</li>
      <li>it does not run cooler at all,it is very heavy,i would like to return it.when</li>
      <li>i liked very much everythig is what i expected, the product detail it was the same as it was shown</li>
      <li>We use the older model version of this where I work</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>The one time I used it on my cat, it heated up so much and was so loud that my cat was scared to death.</li>
      <li>normally it would take me a couple of hours to shave my dog.</li>
      <li>When I was considering a new set of clippers, this set came up</li>
      <li>I had to buy a new one</li>
      <li>Spent that much money for a product that doesn&#x27;t cut worth a flip.  </li>
      <li>We shaved 4 adult and 3 kid goats without a problem.  </li>
      <li>This is my second Oster (First lasted over ten years!)</li>
      <li>Sharp &amp; efficient, and grooming took less time, which I&#x27;m sure my dog appreciates.  </li>
      <li>BUT FOR THE PRICE IT SHOULD INCLUDE A EXTRA BLADE ATLEAST OR COOL DOWN SPRAY</li>
      <li>The only thing that I have against it is that it is a little bulky but other than that I love these clippers.</li>
      <li>I found that the blade did not  get hot and unlike my other clippers, it does not clog or shut off on me constantly.</li>

<li> The noise didn&#x27;t bother her, but she also doesn&#x27;t mind the vacuum cleaner</li>
<li> and I mean burning hot..</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t believe I have gone so long without these!</li>
<li> I have owned the single speed for years.</li>
<li> For a job that took me 5 hours with the previous clippers, it only took me 30minutes with these.</li>
<li> using it with calves with the hair no more long than of a dog it suddenly stopped working, I don&#x60;t recommend this, total waste of money.</li>
<li> i use the koolant it takle to long to kool down.</li>
<li> Never shaved any animal other than myself.  </li>
<li> The gripe is that the clippers are just not worth the money spent.  </li>
<li> I am using this on a schnauzer, it heats up a bit but doesn&#x27;t clog like the other clippers we used.</li>
<li> The price of this clipper was way less than any other that I have purchased over the past few years would recommend.</li>
<li> it also no comfortable in the hand .</li>
<li> Cuts through even tight, curly hair like butter!  </li>
<li> It worked decently maybe two times with cutting through her thick, sometimes matted fur.</li>
<li> the design is so ergonomic -----my wrist wasn&#x27;t tired when  we were finished.  </li>
<li> but I don&#x27;t feel uncomfortably so.</li>

    <li> i liked very much everythig is what i expected, the product detail it was the same as it was shown</li>
    <li> It worked only once before it stopped working. The one time I used it on my cat, it heated up so much and was so loud that my cat was scared to death. I regret buying it....</li>
    <li> love these they are awesome and do a great job</li>
    <li> IT GETS HOT VERY QUICKLY. POWER WISE ITS OKAY BUT FOR THE PRICE IT SHOULD INCLUDE A EXTRA BLADE ATLEAST OR COOL DOWN SPRAY</li>
    <li> Cuts through even tight, curly hair like butter!  Sharp &amp; efficient, and grooming took less time, which I&#x27;m sure my dog appreciates.  Will never buy another brand again..the design is so ergonomic -----my wrist wasn&#x27;t tired when  we were finished.  Cuts smoothly and evenly.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> We use the older model version of this where I work and I just bought this for myself at home. It is an awesome clipper!</li>
    <li> I bought this recently after so many expensive grooming bills for my Great Pyrenees. I had actually went to PetSmart before buying this one and got $50.00 andis clippers with various blades (recommendation from someone working there). It worked decently maybe two times with cutting through her thick, sometimes matted fur. I had to buy a new one so I tried this one. For a job that took me 5 hours with the previous clippers, it only took me 30minutes with these. It cut through her hair like butter and she didn&#x27;t move. The noise didn&#x27;t bother her, but she also doesn&#x27;t mind the vacuum cleaner so I can&#x27;t comment on noise issues. It didn&#x27;t get hot either. The only thing that I have against it is that it is a little bulky but other than that I love these clippers.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I am planning g on using I t today I have 2dogs that I have always groomed and the ones in the stores don&#x27;t last aslong</li>
    <li> I spent a lot of money on different brands and out of all the ones I&#x27;ve used so far, this was the best! Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> While using it the very first day it stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;When using it with calves with the hair no more long than of a dog it suddenly stopped working, I don&#x60;t recommend this, total waste of money.</li>
    <li> If you want the best that Oster has to offer? These clippers are for you. We trim our horses for horse shows and these can handle the job. They run and work great.</li>
    <li> I am using this on a schnauzer, it heats up a bit but doesn&#x27;t clog like the other clippers we used.</li>
    <li> Love the 2 speeds, can&#x27;t beat oysters, great clipper, I would recommend to everyone.  I use to cut human hair, but the high speed would work great for animal hair.  If you cut a lot of hair this is the best way to go!</li>
    <li> it does not run cooler at all,it is very heavy,i would like to return it.when i use the koolant it takle to long to kool down.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working great except it gets hot too quick like in 5 mins. I had one purchased at petsmart the blue colored, had to took it back it got hot in 1 minute and I mean burning hot..I saw a chrome one and liked it ordered it and like it would recommend to everyone. It works great👍...</li>
    <li> Is,ok im a master barber I had so many clippers in my hands so this clipper by oster is just like the 76 by oster as well just it has two speeds the low speed you never use it cause you really dont need it .and it also no comfortable in the hand .</li>
    <li> I have owned the single speed for years. When I was considering a new set of clippers, this set came up and I found that it is much superior to many of it&#x27;s competitors.</li>
    <li> The price of this clipper was way less than any other that I have purchased over the past few years would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is my second Oster (First lasted over ten years!) They do get a little warm in my hand but I don&#x27;t feel uncomfortably so. fyi Keep the clipper blade lubricated with a quality light oil so you don&#x27;t overwork the clipper motor.</li>
    <li> I use these to clip my cats its a very good trimmer however it can get pretty warm with longer use. Best to take breaks with it.</li>
    <li> Spent that much money for a product that doesn&#x27;t cut worth a flip.  Bought the Kool Lube to help with heating up and that does help that issue.  The gripe is that the clippers are just not worth the money spent.  My cheaper Wal-Mart Clippers worked better.</li>
    <li> Never shaved any animal other than myself.  I was impressed with the effortless shaving and shedding of hair from the trimmer.  We shaved 4 adult and 3 kid goats without a problem.  The trimmer had the power to slice through some of the thicker spots and did so leaving a nice clean cut in it&#x27;s path.  The goats placed 1st and 2nd in their respective divisions and our 4 year old took Grand Champion; I credit her blood for that but having a nice clean shave didn&#x27;t hurt.  Works perfectly.  I&#x27;ll be back in 20 years to update my review.</li>
    <li> Had to adjust metal bracket that held clipper head to keep it from rattleing and cut properly. Spare set of motor brushes, oil and cleaning brush was a good touch. Two speed is also good at times.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I have gone so long without these! But I did drop them already and they make a funny sound. So I have only used them once but I fell in love.</li>
    <li> The Oster A5 Turbo 2 Speed did more than meet my expectations.  I&#x27;ve used it twice to shave my Australian Shepard.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  as a matter of fact I&#x27;ve already recommended it my Mom. normally it would take me a couple of hours to shave my dog. Belle loves it too.  I found that the blade did not  get hot and unlike my other clippers, it does not clog or shut off on me constantly.</li>
