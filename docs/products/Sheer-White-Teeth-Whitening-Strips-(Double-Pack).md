    <li> Really works--better than the OTC strips. The Amazon price makes it worth it. I bought my first box from the dentist at $75. Wouldn&#x27;t pay that price again.</li>
    <li> Work on my teeth but not that white</li>
    <li> I bought a box of these same strips from my dentist and paid $75! I wore them while I slept and after a couple of strips, I couldn&#x27;t believe the improvement of the whiteness of my teeth. I am a heavy coffee drinker and never thought my teeth could get white again, especially after 5 days. The dental hygienist said that they could possibly whiten a little more with another box of strips. They were out of the strips, so I checked Amazon and couldn&#x27;t believe they were only $25, so I ordered a box. The hygienist, also said that if I treat my teeth one night a month, it should keep my teeth white. She told me that is what she does.</li>
    <li> Works great.  They stay put at night.</li>
    <li> Sheer white has worked great for me.  Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> works easy sticks to my teeth so the whiten and it works just as stated.  Works much better than any other product we have tried.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my mother in law&#x27;s dental hygienist. This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a teeth whitening product.  The strips are very easy to use.  The box recommeneds keeping them in for 2-8 hours.  I kept mine on for 2 hours.  I found it difficult to keep them on over night because it felt like they were slipping off my teeth even though They were not.  Removal was easy but it did tend to be a little difficult to get off the front top teeth.  My MIL said you need to pull down from the middle instead of the side.  I&#x27;m very happy with the results. My husband could tell a difference just after one application.  So far, I&#x27;ve used two.  I&#x27;m taking a little break since my teeth became just a little sensitive.  Great product.  I highly recommend it and plan on using them again.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my dentist. I can see the difference in the color of my teeth.</li>
    <li> I chose a 5 star rating because I have found that this product does a great job whitening my teeth. I have used them several times this year and my teeth are noticably whiter.</li>
    <li> We got a sample of this from the dentist - great product at a good price.</li>
    <li> Excellent, I gave them to my fiancé to use and we saw the difference in 1 use. I use one from my dentist and they don&#x27;t even work as well, I was amazed!</li>
    <li> Better than what you pay $300 for at the dentist!</li>
    <li> These work and they came on time and were fresh.</li>
    <li> Everything came in as agreed. Perfect</li>
    <li> Did not seem to work as well as the ones from the dentist office.  Same packaging but different outcome.  Strange.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results until after the 3rd use but could really tell a difference from the 4-5th time. It didn&#x27;t make my teeth or gums hurt very bad unless I left it on for more than 2 hours so I only leave it on 2 hrs to avoid the sensitivity. I definitely recommend this whitener.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several whitening methods...trays, Crest strips, dentist prescribed peroxide syringes... but these have worked the best.  My dentist recommended them but unfortunately I bought them from my dentist for $75 for a 5-strip pack. A moment of weakness after a teeth cleaning visit shortly before the Holidays!  Much cheaper on line.  Hurray!!  Best feature is the stickiness of the strips. You can actually drink water as they state and not swallow them or lose potency out during the whitening process. Much easier to install than regular strips at the pharmacy chain stores. Much less &amp;#34;peroxide-y&amp;#34; taste than all the others.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> As usual with any whitener (I think), there is sensitivity after using for a day or two.  It is worth it.  I use these once a week to brighten up my teen after a week of coffee.</li>
    <li> These work well.  I slept in them for four nights straight and could a noticeable difference after night #4.  I would highly recommend them.  My dental hygienist told me they were the same thing that the dentist sells in his office, only cheaper.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product!  Super fast Shipper!!  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for the price point</li>
