      <li>It goes on smoothly</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a good value, since many jars only contain 1 to 1.7 ounces.  </li>
      <li>Not greasy no shine and leaves my skin feeling clean</li>

      <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND KNOW THAT IT WORKS ON OLDER PERSONS</li>
      <li>This product won&#x27;t stop sagging but for me it&#x27;s a nice day cream ( need to add sunscreen if worn outside  during day).</li>
      <li>Brings out ones inner brightness in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and non greasy and has a very mild, clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>L’Oreal states it will deeply moisturize and help improve skin elasticity, making skin become more resilient and radiant while its youthful cushion is restored.</li>
      <li>and I feel better about going into my next life stage.</li>
      <li>To much for my skin.</li>
      <li>So I really can’t recommend this one.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for everything</li>
      <li>So I really can’t recommend this one.  </li>
      <li>The price is reasonable and it seems to be helping my skin.</li>
      <li>and this really works to&lt;</li>
      <li>I love the entire L&#x27;Oreal line for mature skin care products.</li>
      <li>The company is active in the dermatology, toxicology, tissue engineering, and biopharmaceutical research fields and is the top nanotechnology patent-holder in the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>add that the cream’s powerful formula of Beta hydroxyl acid complex will help improve the appearance of age spots while its soy seed proteins will improve elasticity for more toned, supple and resilient skin, and that it is non-greasy, dermatologist tested and non-comedogenic.&lt;br</li>
      <li>, when I last purchased from Amazon, the 3 items I selected came from 3 different suppliers, so I paid more for shipping.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>L&#x27;Oreal isn&#x27;t cheap, but I can manage, and I have complete confidence, especially with the &#x27;Revitalift&#x27; items.</li>
      <li>The firm adds that its testing, based on consumer evaluations, has found that 94% of users thought they saw more hydrated skin immediately.  </li>
      <li>This product is soft and creamy, easy to apply, a little covers a large area.  </li>
      <li>Often I try something new</li>
      <li>This is, I believe, a relatively new product offered by L’Oreal Paris, the world’s largest cosmetics company, and one of the world’s largest chemical companies.  </li>
      <li>The description is the same but the package is different, says now soy seeds, the formula had changed is more greasy and it feels like sealing your skin with something very oily and heavy that makes the skin hot.</li>
      <li>I am 62 and have always been blessed with young looking skin, but I believe daily toning and moisturing is very beneficial.</li>
      <li>I gave it to my husband who does not have hands as sensitive as mine are.</li>
      <li>This jar is 2.5 ounces, a nearly 50% increase over the 1.7 ounce jars, so it lasts longer.  </li>
      <li>I wholeheartedly recommend all L&#x27;Oreal products for &#x27;mature&#x27; skin.</li>
      <li>but I keep coming back to this particular cream.  </li>
      <li>I usually use it on the top of the Glytone Facial Cream for an extra moisturizing benefit.  </li>
      <li>Skin also experiences significant changes such as deep dryness, sagging due to a lack of resilience, and increased appearance of age spots.  </li>
      <li>and after I started using this product I&#x27;ve gotten comments on how much younger my skin looks, in fact one friend also started using it after seeing how soft and hydrated my skin looked.</li>
      <li>It is not at all greasy and a little bit goes a long way, making it well worth the price.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I wholeheartedly recommend all L&#x27;Oreal products for &#x27;mature&#x27; skin. If I run out, my skin immediately shows that it &#x27;misses&#x27; the product. This particular item is best for me.&lt;br /&gt;My local chain drugstore has an incomplete supply of L&#x27;Oreal products; I never know what I&#x27;ll need that they won&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;I also save money when I purchase from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;My only slight &#x27;complaint&#x27; would be that the Amazon products are in slightly smaller amounts than I&#x27;m used to, and that the packaging implies otherwise; the packaging is significantly &#x27;larger&#x27; than it needs to be.&lt;br /&gt;Also, when I last purchased from Amazon, the 3 items I selected came from 3 different suppliers, so I paid more for shipping.&lt;br /&gt;But these are minor considerations, given that I love/need L&#x27;Oreal and can&#x27;t afford the pricier brands. I know these things can be immensely more expensive. L&#x27;Oreal isn&#x27;t cheap, but I can manage, and I have complete confidence, especially with the &#x27;Revitalift&#x27; items. I&#x27;ll never change, even if my acting career propels me into another level of affordability.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this product!  I use it every night and have seen an improvement in my skin!  I am so happy I decided to get this and am going to order more by the end of the week. I definitely do not want to run out of it!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND KNOW THAT IT WORKS ON OLDER PERSONS MALE OR FEMALE.  TRY TO ALWAYS FIND IT ON AMAZON AS THE PRICE IS LOWER ON THEIR SITE.  WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR THIS ITEM.</li>
    <li> Works great and feels good on your face.</li>
    <li> This cream left a film on my hands and made them itch.  I gave it to my husband who does not have hands as sensitive as mine are.</li>
    <li> This cream seems to be helping to prevent wrinkles and lines from appearing.  I use it every night after I clean my face. It is moisturizing.  The price is reasonable and it seems to be helping my skin.</li>
    <li> My wife would like, use it every day, it is good because it brings more amount than other presentations. Thanks for everything</li>
    <li> Love this amazing product.  Who knew that great skin care does not need to cost a fortune?  This is a product I would buy over and over without thinking twice!!!!!</li>
    <li> One of my go to products. This leaves my face feeling smooth and hydrated without feeling greasy like most products do</li>
    <li> I usually use it on the top of the Glytone Facial Cream for an extra moisturizing benefit.  I have used it for many years without disappointment.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is just as described and better than I was expecting from L&#x27;Oreal.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mother and she was very pleased with the results that everybody noticed!, Very nice to be able to order this by amazon.     09/30/2014 The description is the same but the package is different, says now soy seeds, the formula had changed is more greasy and it feels like sealing your skin with something very oily and heavy that makes the skin hot. Results are oily skin, oily nose...</li>
    <li> I had surgery and was unable to put any creams on my face.  My skin looked the same with or without this cream.</li>
    <li> The perfect night cream.</li>
    <li> I like the Age Perfect line.  This product won&#x27;t stop sagging but for me it&#x27;s a nice day cream ( need to add sunscreen if worn outside  during day). I know it says it&#x27;s for night but I did not find it hydrating enough for a night cream.</li>
    <li> Yes,  my skin is &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; along with the rest of me. I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s made me look any younger, but it does moisturize well. It is not at all greasy and a little bit goes a long way, making it well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product for women ages 35+.  A must-have to maintain youthful skin.  A good product with a trusted company.</li>
    <li> i think i need the  3x laser from L&amp;oacute;real...so it is not for my age.</li>
    <li> My mother-in-law swears by this moisturizer!  She&#x27;s 94 and looks 60!  Getting more difficult to find for her without going to several stores.  So glad I could purchase it here in the quantity she wanted and a better price!!</li>
    <li> I love the entire L&#x27;Oreal line for mature skin care products. My skin is more hydrated, softer, fewer age spots and I feel better about going into my next life stage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  I think it works well.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I am  a senior citizen and this really works to&lt;br /&gt;moisturize.  Buy it every month.  Cannot find anything to top it yet for the price.</li>
    <li> This product is soft and creamy, easy to apply, a little covers a large area.  It goes on smoothly so it will not add to any downward pull when applying, which might add to aging over time.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  For the money it does not get better.  Not greasy no shine and leaves my skin feeling clean</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my late sixties and discovered this cream several years ago and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. I have very dry skin and after I started using this product I&#x27;ve gotten comments on how much younger my skin looks, in fact one friend also started using it after seeing how soft and hydrated my skin looked. I only use a very small amount at a time so one jar lasts quite a while.</li>
    <li> To much for my skin. I like l&#x27;oreal products. I use the Serum moisturizing.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect Night Cream for Mature Skin 2.5 oz. from L&#x27;Oreal Paris.  This is, I believe, a relatively new product offered by L’Oreal Paris, the world’s largest cosmetics company, and one of the world’s largest chemical companies.  L’Oreal states it will deeply moisturize and help improve skin elasticity, making skin become more resilient and radiant while its youthful cushion is restored. The makers characterize the product as an anti-sagging, anti-age spot, hydrating moisturizer that will rebuild the sun’s substance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They add that the cream’s powerful formula of Beta hydroxyl acid complex will help improve the appearance of age spots while its soy seed proteins will improve elasticity for more toned, supple and resilient skin, and that it is non-greasy, dermatologist tested and non-comedogenic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al Group is headquartered in Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine, France. It offers many cosmetics under many brand names, including Lancome, Feria, Maybelline, Essie, Garnier, Matrix and others, concentrating on hair color and care, skin care, sun protection, make-up and perfumes. The company is active in the dermatology, toxicology, tissue engineering, and biopharmaceutical research fields and is the top nanotechnology patent-holder in the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that starting with menopause, the skin loses up to 30% of its substance due to hormonal changes, reducing its underlying cushion and support.  Skin also experiences significant changes such as deep dryness, sagging due to a lack of resilience, and increased appearance of age spots.  L’Oreal states that its research has developed this complex that will help menopausal and post-menopausal skin rebuild itself, in which the soy seed proteins stimulate the synthesis of natural fibers found in younger skin.  The firm adds that its testing, based on consumer evaluations, has found that 94% of users thought they saw more hydrated skin immediately.  73% thought they saw firmer, smoother skin, with reduced appearance of surface wrinkles and fine lines in four weeks.  Age spots were thought to be visibly reduced in eight weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The makers suggest that this product should be applied in the evening, after cleansing and applying serum treatment and eye cream: that the user should gently smooth the cream onto the face until it is thoroughly absorbed.  Users will, they state, find their skin improved in the morning.  I have found, using this night cream that the appearance of my skin has improved.  It is tighter, more resilient,  and, as promised, age spots have lightened.  Unfortunately, as with some other of their products, it does seem to have caused me to  break out in pimples– at my age, for heaven’s sake.  After having used it for a while, and found the pimples, I have deliberately not used it – or any other night cream-- for a while.  I find the pimples are drying up.  Other night creams do not have this effect. So I really can’t recommend this one.  Sorry.irmer, smoother skin, with reduced appearance of surface wrinkles and fine lines in four weeks.

    <li> I am searching through my records to see if I bought this from Amazon, but I still want to recommend this wonderful night cream.  I use it for a daily moisturizer under mineral powder.  I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make-up, but I like to tone and moisturize before applying a touch of powder and blush.  Often I try something new (I think we all fall into that trap) but I keep coming back to this particular cream.  It&#x27;s also a good value, since many jars only contain 1 to 1.7 ounces.  This jar is 2.5 ounces, a nearly 50% increase over the 1.7 ounce jars, so it lasts longer.  I am 62 and have always been blessed with young looking skin, but I believe daily toning and moisturing is very beneficial.</li>
    <li> Brings out ones inner brightness in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and non greasy and has a very mild, clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
    <li> Great product. .&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for a few years, and find it gives me a natural sense. I definitely recommend it.</li>
