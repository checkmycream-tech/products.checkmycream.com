      <li>This is a great product for long tangly hair.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best product I have ever used on my hair, especially since I straighten it a lot.</li>
      <li>I have been told to use a clarifying shampoo (in case you don&#x27;t already) as it can cause buildup if you use a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t clean your hair.</li>
      <li>I also LOVE the smell, very tropical.  </li>
      <li>I put it in my hair when I&#x27;m finished showering and let my hair dry naturally (without blow dryer) and my hair smelled and felt great!</li>

      <li>Clean fresh scent.</li>
      <li>I had a sample bottle of some kerastase hair serum and decided to get this stuff, Super skinny serum because it&#x27;s a vegan product; no animal testing or by-products.</li>

      <li>I have used Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Super Skinny Serum for years now.  </li>

      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and my hair is very silky and smooth.  </li>
      <li>It does smell nice but the scent doesn&#x27;t last in the hair at all.</li>
      <li>It left my hair nice and silky after ironing it.</li>
      <li>For the price it was well worth the buy.</li>
      <li>Its worth the price.</li>
      <li>Totally worth the price</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that can sleek my curly hair and help me blow it dry more easily.</li>
      <li>salon stylist recommended it for me, even thought I have straight hair, because my fair gets dry and gets electrostatic!</li>
      <li>The delivery time was super fast and there was no problems with my order.</li>
      <li>The shipping was very fast .</li>
      <li>I am going back to using Crack, which works better for me than anything else.</li>

      <li>The product is exactly what I was looking for - it shortens my drying time and adds lots of shine to my hair.</li>
      <li>I am most definitely going to be buying this again.</li>

      <li>Hair came out BONE straight</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find a way to get my hair straight without relaxing it or putting permanent things in it, and this worked really well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells kind of like green apple, but is definitely not overpowering like cheap shampoo.  </li>
      <li>This stuff makes styling and blow drying so much quicker and easier.</li>
      <li>As you&#x27;re using this product you will want to ensure that you do not use too much and keep it away from your roots or your hair will start to look greasy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have naturally frizzy hair, I put this product in my hair and not only does it smell great, it leaves my hair silky , smooth and frizz free.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product, lasts for a while because you only need a little each use.</li>
    <li> If you are old enough to remember RoseAnne Roseannadanna, then I don&#x27;t need to explain any further.  I have long very thick coarse hair.  This product actually works and does not leave your hair feeling limp or oily.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have been re-ordering it for years! It&#x27;s comparable to Biosilk, but gets your hair even shinier and softer! When I get low I start to panic and go to a couple of stores to find it. Unfortunately most of the hair stores here in my city don&#x27;t have it available (or they mark up the prices more) so I am going to get it from Amazon from now on. Can&#x27;t say enough about this product! Just make sure you don&#x27;t use too much, if you do it&#x27;ll weigh your hair down.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. It&#x27;s the only product that helps my naturally wavy/frizzy hair smooth out and shine! I put a bit in my damp hair and blow dry. It&#x27;s wonderful! Smells good too.</li>
    <li> Are you a product junkie?  Well, look no further on your lazy days than Paul Mitchell&#x27;s \\&quot;Super Skinny Serum.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take one pump of this magic stuff and rub in my palms to warm it.  Then I run my fingers from my ears down in my waist length virgin asian hair when damp.  It air dries perfectly (and faster!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use this to add shine to dry hair.  I usually do this after blow drying (don&#x27;t forget to heat protect damp hair before blow drying!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to not over use this product and you will never get greasy or heavy hair when using this product. I use 1 pump for my WAIST length hair.  All you need for shorter is half a pump.  This also means the product lasts FOREVER!  Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> My daughter has been using this for several years.  It is great to calm the frizzies and maintain control.  I find that the shipping is a bit overprices though.</li>
    <li> I have tried an incalculable number of hair serums and this one is still the best I&#x27;ve used in 10 years. I have blond highlighted hair and this smooths and helps my hair dry quicker. It is a shame that the paul mitchell skinny shampoo and conditioner don&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> makes your hair beautiful!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly, frizzy hair. This is by far the best product I have ever used on my hair, especially since I straighten it a lot. I highly reccommend it.</li>
    <li> I received this in the mail and it was well protected to prevent spillage.  The product is exactly what I was looking for - it shortens my drying time and adds lots of shine to my hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for long tangly hair.  I use it after washing my hair, makes it super easy to comb thru tangles.  I also LOVE the smell, very tropical.  I also use it in my grandaughter&#x27;s hair for a non-crying comb thru.  Does not seem to leave hair oily looking or anything, either.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair that can get frizzy and is hard to dry. This stuff makes styling and blow drying so much quicker and easier. Just use a small drop of it. Don&#x27;t overuse it or your hair will feel greasy! I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I bleached my hair and the ends frayed for about 8 months and were really fried. This stuff saved my hair when glops upon glops of conditioner did nothing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using PM Super Skinny Serum for some time now but I&#x27;ve never bought it online until now.  I love this product because it&#x27;s light and not too heavy, but still smooths my coarse curly hair and makes it easier to control.  It also creates a beautiful shine.  The price was excellent and I&#x27;m more than happy!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for something to make your hair sexy, conditioned and straight, use this, I love it! Thanks Paul Michell for making our life easier!&lt;br /&gt;My salon stylist recommended it for me, even thought I have straight hair, because my fair gets dry and gets electrostatic!</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully, does not weigh down my fine hair at all</li>
    <li> Probably a healthier way to get shiney hair but my hair dresser recommended it and it does work.</li>
    <li> Works wonders! My hair is much more smooth now and it doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy. I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This is a little pricey but its worth it to me.It does not weigh my hair down,and its not greasy.It is real light.Makes your hair silky,soft and shine.I will never be without this product.Its worth the price.It is a fantastic product.</li>
    <li> Works great with Paul Mitchell Straight Works</li>
    <li> I love this product, my hair is quite dry, super shinng brings life and luster to my hair, the best product on the market</li>
    <li> i used to use Redken Glass and I loved it before it got discontinued. This product does not replace it because it&#x27;s not as thick.</li>
    <li> Mix this with your favorite oil or use it alone. Amazing product!  Makes your hair feel like silk!  Apply to ends of hair when wet for best results.  Not ideal, but can be used on dry hair.  Different feel though.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t as sticky and greasy as other brands. I have fine hair and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down to much. I love this stuff and can&#x27;t live without.</li>
    <li> I had a sample bottle of some kerastase hair serum and decided to get this stuff, Super skinny serum because it&#x27;s a vegan product; no animal testing or by-products. This stuff is seriously the same texture and smell as kerastase and it feels like silk on your hands and in your hair like kerastase does.. It&#x27;s the same stuff.. Only vegan and half the price as kerastase!</li>
    <li> Very happy with product, would buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> Great for keeping your hair soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that can sleek my curly hair and help me blow it dry more easily. Other products help me get it straight but the flyaways are still visible. With this, I can calm the frizz fuzz and make it through the day with shiny soft hair. Clean fresh scent. Not sticky. Use just a pea-sized drop for hair that is shorter than shoulder length.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that great. I use it on my Brazilian sew-in hair extensions but it doesn&#x27;t really work for me. It does smell nice but the scent doesn&#x27;t last in the hair at all. I prefer Redden Friz-Dismiss Spray or plain old Morrocan/Argan oil.</li>
    <li> Too expensive! I have naturally curly hair with Corse texture this product just made my hair fizzy and feel nasty on the plus side it smells really good.</li>
    <li> The super skinny serum works to calm some of the frizz due to thermal damage that is acquired during straightening techniques required for a straight look with my naturally wavy hair. As you&#x27;re using this product you will want to ensure that you do not use too much and keep it away from your roots or your hair will start to look greasy. Once you use this a few days it is quite easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a lovely scent during application. You will want to wash your hands after applying as there is silicone residue that remains on your hands.</li>
    <li> I have fine thin platinum blond hair. It is not sticky and does not leave build up. As my hair gets longer I may need something else for volume but it is good for making hair flat and humidity resistant.</li>
    <li> I have used Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Super Skinny Serum for years now.  This product does all I need it to do.  It leaves my hair soft, shiny, smooth and straight.  I use it year round.  In the winter I use it to straighten out the natural wave in my hair.  In the summer it tends to frizz up in humid weather.  A bottle lasts me at least 6 months. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using many different brands for quite a while, but when I started to use paul mitchell I fell in love, it leaves my hair so smooth and makes it look healthy. The shipping was very fast . Would Definately buy again from here :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 5 years now.  There&#x27;s nothing better to keep my hair shinny and frizzy-free. LOVE it.</li>
    <li> i use this every time i wash my hair!! loveeee it</li>
    <li> Wonderful product at a fantastic price.</li>
    <li> For the price it was well worth the buy. Nothing seemed off about the product and it seems authentic. It performs just as well as the super skinny serum I bought at ulta. The delivery time was super fast and there was no problems with my order.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this product by a friend. It left my hair nice and silky after ironing it. I put it in my hair when I&#x27;m finished showering and let my hair dry naturally (without blow dryer) and my hair smelled and felt great!</li>
    <li> I love this serum.  My hair has a little wave to it, so I end up blow drying after every wash.  Super Skinny protects my hair and cuts my blow drying time in half.  It also seems to help with the static electricity during the winter.  It has definitely made my hair a little more manageable.  I have purchased this product in the store before, but it saved me a couple bucks buying it online.</li>
    <li> Nice thick product for wavy thick dry hair</li>
    <li> Love it.  Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy / oily.  Really does seem to do a good job protecting your hair from damage.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Excellent! Not greasy makes hair shiny and healthy</li>
    <li> I love the watermelon smell. It makes my hair soft and untangled but not greasy. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> Smooth and silky! I was skeptical about buying a Paul Mitchell product on amazon, but I love it and I don&#x27;t regret my decision.</li>
    <li> It just goes to show that not every product works on all hair.  I went to a new stylist at Ulta, and she recommended this.  I have used it twice now.  Both times, I was expecting smooth, sleek hair.  Both times, I got a big fuzzball. It&#x27;s as if I didn&#x27;t use anything. I am going back to using Crack, which works better for me than anything else. This was a big disappointment. Good thing I bought the smallest size.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my hair stylist.  I LOVE IT!  I have naturally very dry, frizzy hair.  It helps tone the frizziness down, and protects my hair as I use my heat products.  Not to mention the wonderful fragrance.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I did not get the results that I was expecting after reading all of the great reviews but it smells great which is why I gave it 3 stars. My hair was still extremely frizzy.</li>
    <li> WOW!&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s my first impression of this product. My mom purchased it and I started using it more than she did, until she told me to get my own bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff makes my thick, voluminous, sometimes frizzy hair SMOOTH, silky and manageable! I&#x27;m rocking this bob where the ends fray out behind my ears which drives me nuts - no more! It (the cut) also causes more tangles, and believe it or not this helps with that too! Detangler, smoother, anti-frizz, silky. That&#x27;s what you should expect from this product. It has a pump so you can use a specific amount, and you don&#x27;t need much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells kind of like green apple, but is definitely not overpowering like cheap shampoo.  I have been told to use a clarifying shampoo (in case you don&#x27;t already) as it can cause buildup if you use a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t clean your hair. My mom uses Pantene exclusively and usually has a problem with buildup. I normally swap between multiple brands so I don&#x27;t have that issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIVE STARS because this product is just that awesome. This is the mid-size bottle.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It is much less hassle to purchase this product from Amazon then the salon. I always use this and it works great. I highly recommend for anyone with processed hair.</li>
    <li> My mom purchased this product at a nearby salon after she had her hair cut and styled.  The stylist spoke so highly of it.  She used it several times and said how well it made her hair lay down since she has a problem with flyaways and poof.  Her hair texture has changed over the years.  Well, after she kept talking about it, I started using a little after my shower and noticed immediately how smooth my hair became.  I use a CHI styler and, as anyone who uses it knows, it gets super hot and can cause split ends if you use it too much without proper protection.  Ever since I started using Super Skinny, it has conditioned my hair so well that the split ends are barely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and my hair is very silky and smooth.  I also have a sensitive scalp that got sunburned during an outing at a water park and this product didn&#x27;t irritate the sunburn like I thought it would.</li>
    <li> i have the most dryest hair a person could have. i take all kinds of med for my kidney transpant.  this serum works so great. it is the only product that works for me. i got it from a friend and never stopped getting it.</li>
    <li> needed some serum to help de-frizz my hair a bit. Looked online, this was it! Quick ship, good price. Happy with purchase and all.</li>
    <li> this is just a temporary sleek look</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a way to get my hair straight without relaxing it or putting permanent things in it, and this worked really well. Hair came out BONE straight, it had body, it had volume, it moved. I am most definitely going to be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I really like the consistency of this product and results I get from this product! My hair is TAMED by Super Skinny Serum! What I mean by that is that my colored, highlighted, blow-dried hair that is full of static electricity from the forced air heat this winter is smooth and calmed using this serum. It doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down or make it oily or greasy, either. I really trust the Paul Mitchell products that I have tried. They are high quality. I recommend this Super Skinny Serum!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years and it&#x27;s AMAZING!!! A 5 oz bottle usually last me 6-9 months of frequent use. Totally worth the price and your hair comes out super shiny and soft!</li>
