### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>My friend told me it is the BEST beauty product I have ever recommended.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product!</li>
      <li>Great quality and</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with the price and quality.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE AMAZON!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s bright orange and will stain skin.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I use one drop with my moisturizer and it gives my face a nice glow.  </li>
      <li>I dilute it with my rose hip seed oil.</li>
      <li>This is the best natural product I have ever used!  </li>
      <li>Very strong smelling, and extremely potent.</li>
      <li>What I do know is that it feels wonderful on my sensitive face, nurtures, and gives a healthy glow; certainly better than any blush or bronzer.</li>
      <li>YES Sea Buckthourn is yellow/orange and it can stain clothes and leave a tint on your skin -- but its pure and potent and works beautifully.</li>
      <li>This product is made from SEED OIL, so you may not be getting all of the benefits of the fruit oil if that&#x27;s what you were looking for and may be paying more...</li>
      <li>Really like the product &amp; great travel size</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried better sea buckthorn oil.  </li>
      <li>Thank you so very much keep up the good works.</li>
      <li>The oil was good ,rich and colorful.</li>
      <li>Yellow goes away but does not look good for your lover!</li>
      <li>Honestly, I have not sampled enough Sea Buckthorn to give fair comparison.</li>
      <li>That is also important.</li>
      <li>so maybe I&#x27;ll do another review after a couple months of use, but so far so good.</li>
      <li>had two popped-pimple spots on my forehead that healed significantly after using this.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m thinking this is probably one of the most natural versions out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I broke that, and it tasted fresh, with no fishy taste from getting heated on the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Oh well, you get what you pay for right?</li>
      <li>Also does get on your pillowcase if you use it right before bed, so I have been sleeping with a towel on my pillow and it washes out of the towel easily.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t put it on right before you&#x27;re walking out the door though</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pure berry juice!  </li>
      <li>Very well worth the price.  </li>
      <li>Very hydrating!  </li>
      <li>It goes very well in my face cream!  </li>
      <li>This was my first experience with this oil.  </li>
      <li>Wash off w/pure black Ghana soap in am and just use rose hip for day.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a high grade oil and does exactly what I expect it to do.  </li>
      <li>IT is very yellow.&lt;br</li>
      <li>this oil is really unusable.  </li>
      <li>Use very sparingly.</li>
      <li>It is very fishy</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if all SBO is so very orange.  </li>
      <li>It seems that my skin looks much better than it did with more expensive beauty products from the department store.</li>
      <li>I have blended it with another moisturizer and wore it under make-up when I had more of a tan, but now that my skin is turning paler it will be more difficult to blend.  </li>
      <li>It does come out very orange and will make your skin look yellow where you apply but it will go away when the oil is absorbed.</li>
      <li>All the other products out there are cut with other ingredients and are not as good as this one.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It felt fine on the skin, made it the same yellow as others.&lt;br</li>
      <li>did not try it long enough internally to see if it was EFFECTIVE or not for my bleeding and mites.</li>
      <li>BUT this  product is actually only sea buckthorn seed oil although the description is elusive: Ingredients 100% pure, organic sea buckthorn oil (Hippophae rhamnoides) (99.5%), tocopherol (vitamin E) (antioxidant to preserve the freshness of the oil).</li>
      <li>but I clear that up with clay masks.</li>
      <li>and it helps clear any spots faster than acne creams.</li>
      <li>I have been asked by many why I look younger than in the past.  </li>
      <li>At first, I used it at night and my white pillow cases were yellow in the morning, but it did wash out in the laundry.  </li>
      <li>This oil is very light and moisturizing and sinks into your skin after a few minutes.  </li>
      <li>I have seen products at Sephora that contain sea buckthorn oil added (diluted with other ingredients), but none for less than $50.00!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend that everyone use this for better looking, healthier skin.</li>
      <li>This white palechick in her late 40&#x27;s w/no wrinkles or chem peels is A OK w/this.  </li>
      <li>My skin is on the sensitive side when it comes to sunblock and cosmetics, so this may not happen to everyone, but wanted to present my example for those with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>With a an auto immunecondition which makes it tough to heal, a drop under a band aid heals better than Biafine , my stepoind holy grail.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used it as a moisturizer consistently enough to see long term effects, but I do really like how it feels on my skin.</li>
      <li>By night, I developed tiny rash where I applied the oil.</li>
      <li>So far only Sibu and Seabuckwonders work.</li>
      <li>The product that I usually use I like very much.</li>

<li> I got dry patches and skin started to break out again.</li>
<li> Only can use at night, as it makes you look a little orangey.  </li>
<li> /&gt;It is definitely very yellow and even a couple of drops will make your face look yellow/orange, but it soaks in after half an hour or so, it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;stain\\&quot; skin like some other reviewers have said.</li>
<li> I applied the oil on my face (a few droplets, as instructed on the bottle) and left it for the day (did not go under the sun).</li>
<li> Add it into a face oil in small amounts and blend well -- you won&#x27;t be orange or yellow if you blend.</li>
<li> The other reviewers have NO IDEA what they are talking about.</li>
<li> There are other oils that are not as staining.  </li>
<li> I just bought this product the other day</li>
<li> I read the other review and had to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> There may be other less colored/scented brands, but I use mine at night and mix w/rosehip oil on my face.</li>
<li> It will stain your face yellow and is hard to get off except with soap and water.</li>
<li> Of course it is dark -</li>
<li> and I have been less oily through out the day</li>
<li> Odd smell.</li>
<li> I do think it may cause me black heads around my nose</li>
<li> Looking forward to seeing results after a few weeks of use.</li>
<li> Too bad about that warning, since I use it mostly internally....</li>
<li> Sea Buckthorn Oil is cold pressed from the SEED OF THE BERRY-no additives, no preservatives.</li>
<li> I was afraid to leave it on as it looked like it would stain.</li>
<li> Fail!</li>
<li> It is impossible to use on your skin unless it is in  a place nobody sees.</li>
<li> Hate the scent, and no matter how I dilute it it stains me orange.</li>
<li> rank it up with balanceuticals and seabuckwonders and sibu for freshness and NON FISHY FLAVOR.  </li>
<li> i am very disappointed.</li>
<li> Horrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This oil is very light and moisturizing and sinks into your skin after a few minutes.  As others have commented, it is yellow and can stain fabric.  At first, I used it at night and my white pillow cases were yellow in the morning, but it did wash out in the laundry.  I have blended it with another moisturizer and wore it under make-up when I had more of a tan, but now that my skin is turning paler it will be more difficult to blend.  It has a salty, ocean-like scent, reminiscent of seaweed, which I like, but others may not.  I actually purchased it to blend with some of my fragrance oils to create a beachy scent.  I haven&#x27;t used it as a moisturizer consistently enough to see long term effects, but I do really like how it feels on my skin.</li>
    <li> I read the other review and had to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does NOT stain...you just have to wash it with soap like any brand.  IT is very yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason it says not to be used internally.  I broke that, and it tasted fresh, with no fishy taste from getting heated on the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It felt fine on the skin, made it the same yellow as others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rank it up with balanceuticals and seabuckwonders and sibu for freshness and NON FISHY FLAVOR.  Too bad about that warning, since I use it mostly internally....the ingredients said 100% SBT berry oil, etc....but you never know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not try it long enough internally to see if it was EFFECTIVE or not for my bleeding and mites. So far only Sibu and Seabuckwonders work.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t use. Stains everything. Turns my face orange. Looks like iodine. Horrible. Description misleading.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a high grade oil and does exactly what I expect it to do.  With a an auto immunecondition which makes it tough to heal, a drop under a band aid heals better than Biafine , my stepoind holy grail.  There may be other less colored/scented brands, but I use mine at night and mix w/rosehip oil on my face. Wash off w/pure black Ghana soap in am and just use rose hip for day.This white palechick in her late 40&#x27;s w/no wrinkles or chem peels is A OK w/this.  Pick your battles.  I&#x27;m happy with the price and quality.  They press the entire barry.  That is also important. Research it.</li>
    <li> I have used several different kinds of sea buckthorn oil and this one stains the skin severely.  There are other oils that are not as staining.  this oil is really unusable.  i am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> One ounce of awesomeness! Excellent product! I&#x27;ve referred it to all the women in my family! It goes very well in my face cream!  I LOVE AMAZON!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this stuff and can&#x27;t return it now that it&#x27;s been opened. Hate the scent, and no matter how I dilute it it stains me orange. Fail!</li>
    <li> I applied the oil on my face (a few droplets, as instructed on the bottle) and left it for the day (did not go under the sun). By night, I developed tiny rash where I applied the oil. My skin is on the sensitive side when it comes to sunblock and cosmetics, so this may not happen to everyone, but wanted to present my example for those with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Used on sunburn with overnight results; heals skin rather than just relieving discomfort.</li>
    <li> Use very sparingly. This bottle could last me a life time! I dilute it with my rose hip seed oil. It does make you look yellow, as others had noted, but it will wash off. I like the results I have achieved. It seems that my skin looks much better than it did with more expensive beauty products from the department store.</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with this oil.  I don&#x27;t know if all SBO is so very orange.  Do not use at bedtime, this stained my pillowcases,permanently.  I only apply in,morning.</li>
    <li> I use this in place of acne creams and moisturizer and my skin at night and I have been less oily through out the day and it helps clear any spots faster than acne creams. I do think it may cause me black heads around my nose but I clear that up with clay masks. It does come out very orange and will make your skin look yellow where you apply but it will go away when the oil is absorbed. I have not had any problems with staining my white sheets.</li>
    <li> Really like the product &amp; great travel size</li>
    <li> This type of seabuckthorn oil stained up everything. It is impossible to use on your skin unless it is in  a place nobody sees. I wanted the oil to wash my face with, but I would not recommend this product for that purpose. It will stain your face yellow and is hard to get off except with soap and water. If you&#x27;re looking for seabuckthorn oil for your face - this is not it</li>
    <li> This oil is deeply orange.  I use one drop with my moisturizer and it gives my face a nice glow.  I avoid the chemical cosmetics this way.</li>
    <li> Did not work as well as the Sibu brand. Yellow goes away but does not look good for your lover! Looked like an Oompa Loompa. I wear the oil in the am too, so I could not with this product. My skin did not like this either. I got dry patches and skin started to break out again. I&#x27;m sticking with my Sibu brand. Works miracles!</li>
    <li> I just bought this product the other day so maybe I&#x27;ll do another review after a couple months of use, but so far so good. Bought it at a health food store so I&#x27;m thinking this is probably one of the most natural versions out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely very yellow and even a couple of drops will make your face look yellow/orange, but it soaks in after half an hour or so, it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;stain\\&quot; skin like some other reviewers have said. Don&#x27;t put it on right before you&#x27;re walking out the door though or you might get some stares. Also does get on your pillowcase if you use it right before bed, so I have been sleeping with a towel on my pillow and it washes out of the towel easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had two popped-pimple spots on my forehead that healed significantly after using this. Looking forward to seeing results after a few weeks of use.</li>
    <li> I used it for skin. It&#x27;s bright orange and will stain skin. Odd smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it was oil made form the fruit BUT this  product is actually only sea buckthorn seed oil although the description is elusive: Ingredients 100% pure, organic sea buckthorn oil (Hippophae rhamnoides) (99.5%), tocopherol (vitamin E) (antioxidant to preserve the freshness of the oil). There are lots of reviews for the product that state it is only fruit oil and not seed oil - but if you look closely at the bottle (not shown in pics on this site) just underneath the ingredients it says: DISCUSSION: Sea Buckthorn Oil is cold pressed from the SEED OF THE BERRY-no additives, no preservatives. This product is made from SEED OIL, so you may not be getting all of the benefits of the fruit oil if that&#x27;s what you were looking for and may be paying more...</li>
    <li> Product stains skin yellow.  I&#x27;ve tried better sea buckthorn oil.  WIll never purchase again and returns are not allowed.  Dissatisfied customer.</li>
    <li> This is the best natural product I have ever used!  Very well worth the price.  I mix 2-3 drops with moisturizer or oil at bedtime and apply it to my face, neck, and hands.  I have been asked by many why I look younger than in the past.  I often recommend sea buckthorn oil - especially after receiving complements about my complexion.  My friend told me it is the BEST beauty product I have ever recommended.  Don&#x27;t listen to the complainers about staining, because it washes off and out of any clothes or pillow cases.  Of course it is dark - it&#x27;s pure berry juice!  The same thing would occur with any other berry.  I have seen products at Sephora that contain sea buckthorn oil added (diluted with other ingredients), but none for less than $50.00!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend that everyone use this for better looking, healthier skin.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I have not sampled enough Sea Buckthorn to give fair comparison. What I do know is that it feels wonderful on my sensitive face, nurtures, and gives a healthy glow; certainly better than any blush or bronzer. I even add to my blonde hair to give it a bit of luminescence.</li>
    <li> I have used sea buckthorn for about two years and have been paying a lot of money. The product that I usually use I like very much. This product has a yellow orange color and will scare you when you put it on your face. I was afraid to leave it on as it looked like it would stain. I removed it immediately. My husband can&#x27;t stand the smell of it. It is very fishy and I don&#x27;t know why. I will try the oil mixed with my moisturizer and see if I still look like I have iodine on my skin. Can this product be returned after opning?</li>
    <li> The order came as promised. The oil was good ,rich and colorful. It is still being used as a moisturizer.Thank you so very much keep up the good works.</li>
    <li> The other reviewers have NO IDEA what they are talking about. YES Sea Buckthourn is yellow/orange and it can stain clothes and leave a tint on your skin -- but its pure and potent and works beautifully. Add it into a face oil in small amounts and blend well -- you won&#x27;t be orange or yellow if you blend. OR just use it at night. This bottle will last you FOREVER. Great quality and I use it daily. You can use it as a night treatment also and wash it off in the am. SIMPLE! All the other products out there are cut with other ingredients and are not as good as this one. THANK YOU</li>
    <li> Very hydrating!  Only a drop or so needed.  Only can use at night, as it makes you look a little orangey.  So I only use every so often as part of anti aging arsenal. Love it!</li>
    <li> Very strong smelling, and extremely potent. It will dye your skin yellow temporarily so when using it, always dilute with a carrier oil. Wish it was food grade or approved for internal use but... Oh well, you get what you pay for right?</li>
