      <li>Bought for my husband and it really smells great on him!  </li>
      <li>I was thrilled to see that you had it--however, not now; the product I received is just not acceptable.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is truly a classic of the greatest quality.</li>
      <li>I recieved my Devin quickly and in good condition.</li>
      <li>I love this Aramis.</li>
      <li>this is my husband&#x27;s favorite for many years&lt;</li>
      <li>He says he has gotten many compliments from strangers, both men and women, asking him what scent he&#x27;s wearing and where they can get it.</li>
      <li>My brother-in-law told me that he smelled this wonderful cologne at church and actually asked the guy what he was wearing.  </li>
      <li>My husband has never been one to wear cologne, saying that so many of the scents make him smell \\&quot;like a girl\\&quot; and leave his skin feeling \\&quot;dirty.\\</li>
      <li>Outstanding service on a product I can&#x27;t get anywhere else.</li>

      <li>my hubby&#x27;s favorite scent.</li>

      <li>Thank You:)</li>
      <li>My favorite cologne.</li>
      <li>Great Price here and fast delivery.  </li>
      <li>Regardless, I still like it, my wife likes it too, and I will gladly reintroduce it into my rotation.</li>
      <li>We love the scent.  </li>
      <li>Musk better &amp; Poco Robainne</li>
      <li>It is a very strong cologne and it smells - well, cheap.  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend to anyone wanting a great smelling product</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of the older fragrances that was very popular in the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m good for a whole day with just one spray, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using any more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>AMAZON WAS GOOD ABOUT THE WHOLE THING,</li>
      <li>In either case, the original was better in my opinion.</li>
      <li>This is a classic fragrance because that has gotten me good notice for over thirty years.  </li>
      <li>I too received the \\&quot;New\\&quot; version of Aramis Devin and Not the Original product which was Advertised.</li>
      <li>Smells great all day long.</li>
      <li>I prefer the original.</li>
      <li>My husband loves this cologne and is never disappointed.</li>
      <li>It has unapologeticly clean notes and mixes well with wool and leather.  </li>
      <li>Years later I associate this fragrance with going on missions with good men who you could trust in a fight.  </li>
      <li>Yet another item that we used to be able to buy in local mall department stores, but nobody is carrying any more.  </li>
      <li>AMAZON WAS VERY FAIR AND UNDERSTANDING ABOUT MY COMPLAINT.</li>
      <li>Loyal Aramis customers can certainly perceive the difference!</li>
      <li>an old family favorite</li>
      <li>The fact my purchase doesn&#x27;t seem to smell as good as the early 1980s version I had, and in light of the high number of  buyer complaints about suspect fragrances purchased from Amazon, leads me to believe I probably bought a knock-off, which seems to be a major issue with fragrances sold through Amazon.</li>
      <li>Spend a little more and buy a lighter, fresher and more \\&quot;in\\&quot; cologne.</li>
      <li>Most colognes are a bit too sweet or too spicy (if that makes sense), but this really finds the right spot in between... and boy does it last!</li>
      <li>The spray of the first wave would routinely slap me in the face, reviving the fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I have worn it since My time in London in the late 70&#x27;s and still get a GREAT response from all.  </li>
      <li>most often took the public transit, the city bus, to and from work.</li>
      <li>Aramis Devin is not an overpowering scent that my husband love to splash on daily.  </li>
      <li>The original seemed spicier and more aromatic somehow--in other words, stronger and better--and I think it was also longer-lasting.</li>
      <li>However, I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on it, but the reincarnated Devin seems different to me--perhaps quite a bit milder and more chemical-smelling.</li>
      <li>Things of that nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took careful stock of what it meant to appreciate the finer things in Belk, and learned quickly how much I loved Aramis Devin, but nothing prepared me for the reaction in public to</li>
      <li>This is the first \\&quot;quality\\&quot; cologne I&#x27;ve used, and it really stands apart from the rest.</li>
      <li>I have it in my collection of colognes and alternate between this and some other great ones.</li>
      <li>It has a very woodsy, natural, and clean scent.</li>
      <li>The smell of it made me think of some older person who was wearing cheap cologne and it is so strong that you better only spray a little bit on you or you will overpower everyone around you.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much I&#x27;d missed it until I received it from here.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;M REALLY P%#&amp;ED OFF.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Have had more compliments from this scent than any other.</li>
      <li>Devin scent is certainly reminiscent of the original.</li>
      <li>/&gt;10/19/2015 Update -- I still like the scent of Devin, but I&#x27;ve reduced my original rating of three stars to only two for this particular purchase.</li>
      <li>Your experience will probably not be as dramatically confidence building as mine, but the emotional notes of this scent ring true in all kinds of stressful events.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Riding home the first day I&#x27;d bought, and applied, Aramis Devin, person after person that was near me on the bus was astounded by the fragrance, and driven to ask me the name of</li>
      <li>I was pleased to see it reappear recently, and I subsequently ordered a bottle.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only cologne my hubby will wear, and he&#x27;ll probably be wearing it until the very last bottle disappears from the face of the earth!  : )</li>
      <li>Maybe Aramis will bring back the old version for those of us who enjoy this</li>
      <li>I have been useing this for 25 years and the New has a \\&quot;weaker\\&quot; scent and comes in a 3.4 oz.</li>
      <li>for describing it, it&#x27;s very masculine and somewhat subdued and relaxing, but it still makes its presence known.</li>
      <li>I would rather get the real deal from other online sources or, for a few dollars more, from Macy&#x27;s, Nordstrom, or other reputable retailers</li>
      <li>Hard to find, but love the fragrance.</li>
      <li>Devin Country Cologne was one of my favorite informal colognes in the late 1970s and early 1980s.</li>
      <li>&quot; I turned to retail, and worked the old Belk #004 in downtown Charlotte, North Carolina, before it was \\&quot;uptown.\\</li>
      <li>but that was before I got old and invisable.  </li>
      <li>I will have to find a different source for the real Devin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After wearing this for long hours, you still smell pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i am able to for the last few</li>
      <li>Kelly Rippa was making a big fuss over him on \\&quot;Live...</li>
      <li>While boarding ships in support of UN operations, the small boat I was on would come around from the lee side of our ship into real chop first thing in the morning.  </li>
      <li>Apparently, what I recieved is the \\&quot;new\\&quot; release of Devin.</li>
      <li>Sometime afterward, it was apparently discontinued because I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.</li>
      <li>On the other hand, it has been nearly 30 years since I used up the last of my original splash-on Devin, so the difference may lie in my imagination (or in my aged sense of smell).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve generally used only the cheaper or more common colognes (Brut, Aspen, Adidas Moves, Daytona 500, Vurt, British Sterling, Stetson, Stetson Black, Stetson Untamed, etc.).</li>
      <li>I was a little dissapointed that the scent didn&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;Seemed</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Seemed to be very authentic.....my hubby&#x27;s favorite scent.</li>
    <li> this was for a birthday gift, but by the time this company finally got around to telling me that they were out of stock, it was too late.  i am not happy with this experience!</li>
    <li> This is a classic fragrance because that has gotten me good notice for over thirty years.  It does not make you smell like a ponce or a gender-confused trollop.  It has unapologeticly clean notes and mixes well with wool and leather.  If your clothing choices trend towards lycra and latex, you probably want something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After wearing this for long hours, you still smell pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True story: While boarding ships in support of UN operations, the small boat I was on would come around from the lee side of our ship into real chop first thing in the morning.  The spray of the first wave would routinely slap me in the face, reviving the fragrance.  Years later I associate this fragrance with going on missions with good men who you could trust in a fight.  Your experience will probably not be as dramatically confidence building as mine, but the emotional notes of this scent ring true in all kinds of stressful events.</li>
    <li> This is the fragrance that Bryant Gumbalt wears.  Kelly Rippa was making a big fuss over him on \\&quot;Live...\\&quot; when he was substituting for Regis.  I have worn it since My time in London in the late 70&#x27;s and still get a GREAT response from all.  Now it is hard to find.  Thank Amazon for keeping me in touch with this product. I recieved my Devin quickly and in good condition. It was just as it has always been a great fragrance.  Just the same as I would have bought in the Department store if I could find it.</li>
    <li> Just like all Aramis products, this has a great scent.  Bought for my husband and it really smells great on him!  Supposedly same cologne Bryant Gumbel wears...???</li>
    <li> My husband has never been one to wear cologne, saying that so many of the scents make him smell \\&quot;like a girl\\&quot; and leave his skin feeling \\&quot;dirty.\\&quot; However, I got this cologne for him after hearing that Bryant Gumble has been wearing it for years and often has people ask him what scent he is wearing as it smells clean and \\&quot;manly.\\&quot; On a whim, I bought it for my husband for Christmas and he absolutely loved it! He wears it everyday and will often walk up to me, lean in, and tell me to smell him. It has a very woodsy, natural, and clean scent. It is not overpowering, yet it lasts all day. My husband puts some on after his morning shower and I can still smell it on him when he gets home from work 12 hours later. It&#x27;s not greasy and it doesn&#x27;t leave his skin feeling slightly sticky, like some of the colognes I&#x27;ve purchased for him previously (and that includes some very expensive, name brand colognes). He says he has gotten many compliments from strangers, both men and women, asking him what scent he&#x27;s wearing and where they can get it. I can understand why Bryant Gumble has worn it for as long as he has. Why fix something that isn&#x27;t broken?</li>
    <li> Outstanding service on a product I can&#x27;t get anywhere else. After wearing this fragrance for over 30 years, I can no longer get it at Macy&#x27;s or other department stores. Annoying, but thankfully, I can get it from Amazon for the time-being.</li>
    <li> I was in my 20&#x27;s at a loss about my future, having just walked out of a \\&quot;Bible college,\\&quot; I turned to retail, and worked the old Belk #004 in downtown Charlotte, North Carolina, before it was \\&quot;uptown.\\&quot; I worked in the men&#x27;s clothing department, shirts, ties, umbrellas. Things of that nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took careful stock of what it meant to appreciate the finer things in Belk, and learned quickly how much I loved Aramis Devin, but nothing prepared me for the reaction in public to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I most often took the public transit, the city bus, to and from work. It was easier than trying to find parking in those days, not to mention cheaper - unlimited rides for a month for $10.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Riding home the first day I&#x27;d bought, and applied, Aramis Devin, person after person that was near me on the bus was astounded by the fragrance, and driven to ask me the name of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never seen such a reaction before, or since then, in my now 53 years on this planet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is truly a classic of the greatest quality.</li>
    <li> expensive, but worth every drop!</li>
    <li> Good scent but not the greatest for my husband. Everyone has their own best cologne. This is a good one but I like Monsouir (sp?) Musk better &amp; Poco Robainne the best on him.</li>
    <li> I have been a Devin user for well over a decade. Apparently, what I recieved is the \\&quot;new\\&quot; release of Devin. In this case \\&quot;New\\&quot; IS NOT BETTER. I prefer the original. I will have to find a different source for the real Devin. Too bad</li>
    <li> Yet another item that we used to be able to buy in local mall department stores, but nobody is carrying any more.  We love the scent.  It&#x27;s the only cologne my hubby will wear, and he&#x27;ll probably be wearing it until the very last bottle disappears from the face of the earth!  : )</li>
    <li> an old family favorite</li>
    <li> I have always purchased the 3.7 oz bottle of Aramis Devin cologne. This time the 3.4 oz bottle was substituted as I was told the 3.7 was not available.I just opened the bottle (3.4) and it does not smell the same--my wife even commented--&amp;#34;that does not smell right&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I was also told that I would receive a $5 discount because I was getitng the smaller bottle--did not get that discount either, however that really is not my issue--the product I received is not acceptable. Aramis Devin has been my cologne of choice for years, and finding is getting more difficult--I was thrilled to see that you had it--however, not now; the product I received is just not acceptable. And I do not know what to do....do you have a solution?</li>
    <li> This is the only cologne I use.</li>
    <li> My Man loves this cologne, hard to find in the local stores.  Great Price here and fast delivery.  Thank You:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve generally used only the cheaper or more common colognes (Brut, Aspen, Adidas Moves, Daytona 500, Vurt, British Sterling, Stetson, Stetson Black, Stetson Untamed, etc.). This is the first \\&quot;quality\\&quot; cologne I&#x27;ve used, and it really stands apart from the rest. Most colognes are a bit too sweet or too spicy (if that makes sense), but this really finds the right spot in between... and boy does it last! I&#x27;m good for a whole day with just one spray, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using any more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for describing it, it&#x27;s very masculine and somewhat subdued and relaxing, but it still makes its presence known. It suits casual and formal wear both quite well, but I almost think it fits a casual atmosphere a bit better. I&#x27;m no cologne expert, but that&#x27;s just my two cents. Hope you like it if you try it... chances are you will.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn Devin off and on for close to 30 years. I love the scent, and am often complimented on it. It&#x27;s difficult to find locally, however, so I haven&#x27;t worn it in a long time. I didn&#x27;t realize how much I&#x27;d missed it until I received it from here. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> It is great and the service was too.</li>
    <li> Great seller. Good service. So glad to find this cologne. Have had more compliments from this scent than any other.</li>
    <li> Cant go wrong with this for Dad, almost his #1 choice.</li>
    <li> Hard to find, but love the fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love this Aramis. It&#x27;s one of the older fragrances that was very popular in the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s. I have it in my collection of colognes and alternate between this and some other great ones. Colognes are a very personal choice, some you love and some you hate. I happen to love this one</li>
    <li> Devin is the best after shave (Aramis a close second) I&#x27;ve ever used and the only for some 19 years.</li>
    <li> Only cologne my husband ever worn. Was so hard to find in local stores around where I live.  Has a scent that stays with you.</li>
    <li> The Ladies LOVE it!  That&#x27;s all that needs to be said.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have used it for years. I would recommend this vendor and would uy from ths vendor again.</li>
    <li> My brother-in-law told me that he smelled this wonderful cologne at church and actually asked the guy what he was wearing.  The guy told him Aramis.  My cousin went on and on about how wonderful it smelled.  I bought it online without testing it and that was a mistake.  It is a very strong cologne and it smells - well, cheap.  The smell of it made me think of some older person who was wearing cheap cologne and it is so strong that you better only spray a little bit on you or you will overpower everyone around you.  Just say no to this cologne. Spend a little more and buy a lighter, fresher and more \\&quot;in\\&quot; cologne.</li>
    <li> this is my husband&#x27;s favorite for many years&lt;br /&gt;He wore Aramis prior to this.&lt;br /&gt;for years i couldn&#x27;t get this brand.&lt;br /&gt;now i am able to for the last few years.&lt;br /&gt;it makes my husband very happy, and therefore me as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;eileenfried/nyc</li>
    <li> WHAT IS PICTURED .... THIS IS NOT THE PRODUCT I RECEIVED. I ORDERED THIS SPECIFICALLY, SO AS TO NOT BE CONFUSED WITH THE \\&quot;NEW PACKAGIN\\&quot; IN 3.4 OZ. AMAZON WAS VERY FAIR AND UNDERSTANDING ABOUT MY COMPLAINT. IT WAS THE SELLER WHO MISREPRESENTED MY ORDER BY LISTING BOTH ITEMS NEXT TO EACH OTHER, GIVING THE BUYER A CHOICE. I CHOSE WHAAT I WANTED BY PICTURE AND DESCRIPTION, 3.7 OZ. NOT THE CASE. WELL, I FINALLY GOT A SHIPPING LABEL FROM THE SELLER AND RETURNED THE CRAP THAT WAS SENT. I DON&#x27;T KNOW IF I HAVE BEEN CREDITED YET OR NOT. THE ARAMIS YOU SEE IN THIS PHOTO, BLUE/GREEN BOX IS MY ITEM, BEEN WEARING THIS SINCE 1978. THE STUFF SENT WAS DEPLORABLE....A NASTY TRICK. AMAZON WAS GOOD ABOUT THE WHOLE THING, THOUGH. I STILL DON&#x27;T HAVE ANY OF WHAT I ORDERED, AND MAY NEVER SEE IT AGAIN. I&#x27;M REALLY P%#&amp;ED OFF.</li>
    <li> He smells wonderful :)</li>
    <li> This cologne was difficult to find. I was a little dissapointed that the scent didn&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;Seemed a little weak like it had been in storage a long time. Pricy too! It&#x27;s gone now. I probably won&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;reorder this fragrance from the seller.</li>
    <li> I too received the \\&quot;New\\&quot; version of Aramis Devin and Not the Original product which was Advertised. I have been useing this for 25 years and the New has a \\&quot;weaker\\&quot; scent and comes in a 3.4 oz. vs 3.7 oz. bottle.I&#x27;m not sure how Aramis has changed the aroma and the marketing name has remained the same. Loyal Aramis customers can certainly perceive the difference!</li>
    <li> Aramis Devin is not an overpowering scent that my husband love to splash on daily.  Try it.  You will love it!</li>
    <li> Devin Country Cologne was one of my favorite informal colognes in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Sometime afterward, it was apparently discontinued because I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. I was pleased to see it reappear recently, and I subsequently ordered a bottle. The bottle has been redesigned, made slightly smaller, and it now resembles the container used for Tuscany, another scent by the same designer (Aramis/Estee Lauder), which I also own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Devin scent is certainly reminiscent of the original. However, I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on it, but the reincarnated Devin seems different to me--perhaps quite a bit milder and more chemical-smelling. The original seemed spicier and more aromatic somehow--in other words, stronger and better--and I think it was also longer-lasting. On the other hand, it has been nearly 30 years since I used up the last of my original splash-on Devin, so the difference may lie in my imagination (or in my aged sense of smell). In either case, the original was better in my opinion. Regardless, I still like it, my wife likes it too, and I will gladly reintroduce it into my rotation. Maybe Aramis will bring back the old version for those of us who enjoy this scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/19/2015 Update -- I still like the scent of Devin, but I&#x27;ve reduced my original rating of three stars to only two for this particular purchase. The fact my purchase doesn&#x27;t seem to smell as good as the early 1980s version I had, and in light of the high number of  buyer complaints about suspect fragrances purchased from Amazon, leads me to believe I probably bought a knock-off, which seems to be a major issue with fragrances sold through Amazon. Therefore, unless they start doing a better job weeding out the bad actors among their third party fragrance vendors, I don&#x27;t plan to purchase anymore cologne or perfumes from Amazon. I would rather get the real deal from other online sources or, for a few dollars more, from Macy&#x27;s, Nordstrom, or other reputable retailers</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne. Used it for 30 years.  It is hard to find and has become quite expensive. I understand it is produced in limited quantities around Christmas.</li>
    <li> they used to tell me so but that was before I got old and invisable.  I use it every now and then because even though they won&#x27;t notice me passing by they will at least get a wiff of what used to be.  Too bad it cost so much.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this cologne and is never disappointed. Smells great all day long. Would highly recommend to anyone wanting a great smelling product</li>
