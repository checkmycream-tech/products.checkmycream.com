<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They were not at all what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> this has to be the worst purchase I&#x27;ve ever made. As soon as I took them out of the packaging half the hair fell out. And whose hair would these even blend with? Literally no one. Completely awful. Just spend a little more money and get something that&#x27;s actually worth it.</li>
    <li> Looks like Barbie doll hair! N it was a mess when I got it! Chunks of the fake hair was missing n if you even try to brush it easily no matter what the hair keeps falling out! I haven&#x27;t even worn it because it looks so bad! Not happy would like a refund honestly.But they probably won&#x27;t do that even though i got ripped off And I&#x27;ll send the fake horrible hair back that i received!</li>
    <li> they are very tangly and don&#x27;t even feel like hair!!!! I hate them! very hard to brush out. never buying again!!</li>
    <li> To start, it got here super quick !! I read some of the previous comments and was concerned when i ordered mine. But when it got here i wa shocked. It&#x27;s just like my hair, static, and DOES tangle a lot. You just got to know how to work with it. It is thin but thats as expected! I love this hair!</li>
    <li> Crappy. They arrived tangled and dry and wayyyyy too thin!!! Nothing like real hair at all!</li>
    <li> For the price I paid its not worth it received it hair was very thin and had a lot of static and hair started to come off of the clip part and one clip wouldn&#x27;t open or close</li>
    <li> Do not run through straightener!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> they are better than my human hair clip ons! suft and came here 1 month before estimated shipping! i recommend and very great quality. You cant beat the price.</li>
    <li> Loved these for the price! Stay in well! Were slightly too long so I had to trim them some!</li>
    <li> Worst hair extensions I have ever worked with. Not at all thick and tangle very easily. You can breathe on them and they tangle. Only thing good about them is the length. I regret spending the $20.00 for these crappy extensions.</li>
    <li> I guess for the price i should have expected it to be thin. But these are just horrible, matted and knotted when i got them, cant even use them the hair  just falls out. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> So I just received my clip ins today. In I truely like them I&#x27;m going to order me another pack so I can make it thicker. The only set back is that it gets tangle a lot but I just brush it out with no problem. It blends in with my hair real good you dont even see the clips. Now my mom wants me to order her a pack also. Now that&#x27;s really saying something BC my mom don&#x27;t like to put fake hair in her head. I will most defiantly be doing a review on my you tube page about this product. I really like  it alot in look forward to buying more of their products.</li>
    <li> Nice hair love it I would buy again</li>
    <li> Well i got them on time that&#x27;s a plus. It definitely looks like barbie hair lol but its cute I mean if you have perfect hair I&#x27;ll be great but I have horrible hair sooo its not okay!! -.- some clips are coming off -.- I&#x27;m not mad though I&#x27;ll make it work.</li>
    <li> Great length for the price but get tangled easily if you do not take care of them (brush &amp; wash them)</li>
    <li> love it!!! there so long and pretty they dont fall out and clip in well when i go red im going to order them again</li>
    <li> Its fake hair, what can you really expect. lol DO NOT curl, straighten, wash or brush. Its really just fake barbie like hair. I bought it so I could see if I even liked fake hair. Definitely buy for that reason only. Gave it to my kids to play with, lasted like a week and then i threw it away.</li>
    <li> I loved them!  But 1 week later the clips feel off so I don&#x27;t recommend these.</li>
    <li> MUCH longer than i thought they would be but their perfect! Clips are coming off a little after several uses but i do brush them a lot.</li>
    <li> I got my package 2 weeks earlier than expected.The hairs super silky and straight.If you don&#x27;t comb it,It can get brittle on the bottoms but,other than that it i perfect.I use curling irons on these with water and it comes out perfect.</li>
    <li> At first I liked the hair extensions but after a couple of days they began to get so tangled that I literally had to cut the ends because the hair was so stubborn to detangle. Matter of fact, the second I removed the hair from the package, it fell on the floor accidentally and I had to spend over ten minutes trying to untangle it. It is also non flowing so it looks pretty much like cheap, fake hair (which it is). I do not recommend anyone buying this product. Buy it if you&#x27;re hoping to wear it only once.</li>
    <li> When I got them the set was all tangled. You cant get the knots out and now I am unable to use them! Worst extentions ever!</li>
    <li> I hated these extentions they were super tangled even in the package you could not curl the item only thing their good for is stairght hair but that&#x27;s it&#x27;s plus it&#x27;s very noty</li>
    <li> Everytime I brushed the hair a lot of it would fall out. and I couldn&#x27;t curl it or even wash it without losing a lot of hair.</li>
    <li> So fake looking, and the &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; falls out just by touching it while trying to clip it in. You cannot brush it because you will destroy it if you do. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> So I bought this hair two months ago and received it 2 in a half months later :( but when I got it the mail I was so excited it came in a small package which was surprising because it&#x27;s 22 inch hair, so wen I took them out I had to comb it with my hands for like two minutes, which wasn&#x27;t bad cuz it was really soft not many tangles I was suprised because the reviews of this hair was bad so I expected it to be all tangly and ratted up. But it wasn&#x27;t until like the next two day it got all tangled and stiff looking so I watched a youtube video on how to revive weave so I washed it with just conditioner and combed it, let it dry , comb it and straighten it at 310 and it&#x27;s good as new. I mean u basically get wat u paid for if your buying this product. I liked the hair because it was my first time wearing a weave so it was cool. It&#x27;s really not a bad product so I think u should buy it. P.S wen I first got it, it was really shiny so I put baby powder in it and brushed it out</li>
    <li> i have bought over five hair exstention sets and these ones are one of the nicest seta i own..there very thick and the ends are not split and stragely..there very nice</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product! Came with multiple pieces but are so incredibly thin that you can see where your hair stops and this clip in hair begins! I have purchased Jessica Simpson extensions in the past and they are WAY better! I guess you get what you pay for. Threw these away after spending to much time trying to make it look right....and the hair kept shedding out of the clips! So what is already this is now even thinner!</li>
    <li> Its nice it doesn&#x27;t really fall out as much as others say, I wand curled mine by spraying hair spray then I curled so it worked and after I even got it straight again,&lt;br /&gt;you can play around with it I love it I highly reccomend ! 💜</li>
    <li> They were extremely long so i cut them down.. The hair extensions are VERY thin BUY TWO. The extensions are also really shiney so you can kinda tell the difference...i tried dry shampoo but it didnt calm any of the shine.. These still look great and get the job done. I layered them and they looked pretty natural. You can feel the difference tho..</li>
    <li> My sister requested that I&#x27;d buy these extensions for her and when they came, she was let down. As soon as they came out of the package, the first thing I noticed was that the hair fell out extremely easy. These are the second extensions I&#x27;ve ever bought in my life so my expectations were already not high and still I can say that these were not up to par. There really was no hiding it that they were synthetic. They came in too many pieces if you ask me and they just weren&#x27;t worth it despite its price and quick shipping. My sister wouldn&#x27;t have minded its texture or appearance if it wasn&#x27;t so hard to work with. She couldn&#x27;t get past its shedding so we just put it in a bag and it&#x27;s been there ever since. I guess if you don&#x27;t mind all of that, go for it but I believe there are better ones out there with still relatively low prices.</li>
    <li> hair falls out a bit but other than that its great</li>
    <li> They were falling a part when I pulled them out and were much to thin to make it worth wearing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so nervous to try this out, I read mix reviews but hopefully i fall in the positive side &#x3D;/</li>
    <li> these extensions were awful ., I would never suggest buying synthetic hair from amazon again . The quality of the extensions were alright , but when it comes to putting them on and styling them or anything the quality goes down</li>
    <li> Dyed my hair black for Morticia costume and people couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between the extensions and my own hair.  Texture was great- considering the price this was a great value!</li>
    <li> Thank you . These arrived on time and as described.</li>
    <li> Ok for the price but a lot of hair falls out.</li>
    <li> Clearly synthetic. But! I bought these to add some blending pieces in with other extensions, and they work will for that once they&#x27;re cut short to the size needed. Note though, if you order these and need pin straight hair you will not get that. The package comes folded up, which causes the hair to have a wave to it. And being synthetic, you cannot straighten it. Because they are so long, they get tangly easy but there are enough clips that they aren&#x27;t as thin as most sets. A bit costume wig-ey</li>
    <li> These make a perfect black strip in my minnow imitating streamers.  When tying a bendback I place these just above the fish-hair, and the strip stands out perfectly.  It looks just like a lateral line.  Now if I could only find these in other colors for fly-tying.</li>
    <li> For mine today they were awesome when i first opened the package then I tried them on and lots of hair kept falling out 😕 I like them but that&#x27;s the only problem is that the hair falls out a lot..I haven&#x27;t tried curling the extensions.Im afraid that itll just melt 😦 hummmm....</li>
    <li> Nice for a few hours but expects lots of tangling</li>
    <li> Usually all my synthetic hair extensions aren&#x27;t this fake looking , it bothered me that it didn&#x27;t look or feel real as I expected but it is an overall good price for it and clips in easily . It&#x27;s a pretty silky texture . :)</li>
    <li> I got them earlier then expected which is a good thing. But when it came to putting them in, they tangled super easily and became very hard to brush. I have lost a lot of hair out of each one and I&#x27;m just really disappointed.</li>
    <li> these were terrible. all of the clips are falling off and the hair its self if all nappy. very unsatisfied with these</li>
    <li> I got these in the mail today n have to say i like them once u figure out how to blend ur hair... i have shoulder length hair that is severely damaged and fried.... i think it came out pretty well... it is fake feeling and very shinny but i dont relle care what people think... ive had them in for an hour now and my head dont hurt they do shed alot but so does my natural hair anyway... i do have to say for the price i would recommend to anyone... i only got them to wear to a grad party so well c how they hold... i dk how to put pics otherwise i would....</li>
    <li> Purchased this item for my 15 year old. Delivered on time, arrived in perfect condition. I will purchase a couple more packs for her. She loves the extentions, cut and styled them herself.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t curl them and I couldn&#x27;t wash them or they would get a gross!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived fast i love it fits perfectly shining and the right color i will definitely be ordering more love it great</li>
    <li> In a nutshell, the price is what pulled my attention in. For 11.99 and free shipping, it sounded too good to be true. I took my chances and went for it. I absolutely LOVE! long hair extensions, and 22\\&quot; seemed just right for me. ( my hair hits just about the 18\\&quot; mark.) The extensions come in 12pcs as described, clip on, and the length is long and beautiful. The feel if the extensions didn&#x27;t hurt either as they were very soft and luxurious. I love these. Please don&#x27;t ever discontinue selling these, especially with that unbeatable price!!!!! :-) I&#x27;m satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I forgot to mention that the shipping speed is pretty fast. It shipped in about 3 days or less, and it arrived here in a week and a half. Not too shabby :)</li>
    <li> Amazing. Best set I&#x27;ve gotten for the price. Definitely considering buying different colors.</li>
    <li> Horrible. After one wear, I actually had to throw them out. I would not recommend these for purchase.</li>
    <li> If you have the blackest of black hair, this may work. But it is realistically doll hair. Pretty bummed, next time I will spend the extra money for real human hair.</li>
    <li> the hair was tangled the first day i got it. barely could comb through it. i got what i paid for!</li>
    <li> Hair falls out sheds like a cat you can&#x27;t curl it not a fan of this</li>
    <li> THE CLIP-IN&#x27;S FEEL LIKE BABY DOLL HAIR. IT SUCKS AND THE CLIPS WERE HARD TO OPEN. YOU CANNOT FLAT IRON THEM. HOWEVER I DID ROD THEM WITH SOME PERM RODS AND DIPPED THEM IN BOILING HOT WATER AND THE CURL CAME OUT REAL PRETTY!</li>
    <li> Feels and looks so fake Never again...</li>
    <li> I gave these extensions 4 stars because they tangle kinda easy. I would recommend these to someone who only wears extensions here and there for a limited amount of time. Like on a date night, or for picture day! Because as I said they tangle at the bottom somewhat easy and they are heavy so they can become rather uncomfortable when wearing for an extended period of time. Other than that, you can&#x27;t really even tell their fake. They&#x27;re easy to apply, and they look good. They&#x27;re really long though, but fear not, you can cut them,! It says you can style them but I couldn&#x27;t get mine to curl, just straighten.  They&#x27;re not AS good as real hair extensions of course but you get what you buy! I honestly didn&#x27;t think they&#x27;d be very good cause they were so cheap, but they definitely exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> These lasted for a nice long time, if you&#x27;re looking for nice synthetic hair, I suggest these. They look just like real hair.&lt;br /&gt;Just got easily snarled.</li>
    <li> They were fabulous for about the first day or two. After that, they were absolutely disgusting and unmanageable. I would only buy these if you want them for a one-time use, otherwise, save your money for real human-hair. Cheap, but not worth it.</li>
    <li> was super long and there were so many pieces. I wore them to vegas and just loved how heavy they were!</li>
    <li> I purchase this for a one night event, just got them in. They are doing the job! For the price I have to say they are worth it. I like how straight they are and I can do style it on low heat</li>
    <li> do not waste your money that&#x27;s all im going to say. they fall out of clips. complete waste of money</li>
    <li> I buy these for my mom last time they sucked&lt;br /&gt;😡</li>
    <li> Hair is badddddddddddd. Looks super fake and thin.</li>
    <li> So thin so tangled I hate em</li>
    <li> A lot more hair than I expected! Looks very nice easy to work with. The way it was packaged made it really wavy, but it&#x27;s strong enough to take the straightener on low heat. So very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I love them but only problem is they get tangled up a lot more than real hair extensions.</li>
