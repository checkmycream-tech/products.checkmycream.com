<li> It reacted horribly with my body chemistry and after two tries, with two different bottles, I sadly gave up on Pink</li>
<li> Get it while you can cause they were almost sold out and very hard to find</li>
<li> It is very hard to find this online</li>
<li> (Victoria&#x27;s Secret&#x27;s website doesn&#x27;t appear to have it listed), but I walked into the store just two days ago and found it.</li>
<li> Either way, go to Victorias Secret!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this stuff it smells good. I give it as gifts and im never wrong when I do they always love it.</li>
    <li> This scent was everything I was hoping it would be! I already owned the Beauty Rush &#x27;I Want Candy&#x27; lip gloss, and I was always looking for a scent close to it and this is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently tried Aquolina&#x27;s &#x27;Pink Sugar&#x27; and it was a complete fail. It smelled good when I would spray it on anything but my skin. It reacted horribly with my body chemistry and after two tries, with two different bottles, I sadly gave up on Pink Sugar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy that Candy, Baby smells great on me. The one drawback would be the fact that the fragrance mist does not stay for very long. I&#x27;ll spray, what I believe to be, and ungodly amount on me and I will get subtle hints throughout the day, but not as strong as I would like. That is why I just purchased the Body Drink Lotion and Glimmer Swirl Cream in this scent and I can&#x27;t wait to layer the lotion with the mist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at the size of the bottle. It was a lot bigger than I expected and after using it as much as I have, I&#x27;ve barely made a dent. This bottle will last, but I am contemplating purchasing another so I&#x27;m never without!</li>
    <li> Smells just like synthetic cotton candy. Its so fresh and light and you can carry with you in purse and use as hair, body and room spray.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. It&#x27;s a shame it&#x27;s discontinued but its worth the bump up in price + shipping. Smells like cotton candy. Yum!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance but the last time I bought it I compared it to the one I still had and I think it was watered down.  </li>
    <li> I love this perfume and was glad I was able to purchase it through Amazon since they no longer sell it in the Victoria&#x27;s Secret stores. It smells like cotton candy! I love the sweet smell and that it&#x27;s not too strong. I always get complimented that I smell good when wearing this scent. Love it! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> My daughter loved this fragrance and we were so sad when it was discontinued. It is a light sweet,scent. We were happy that this was the actual product and the fragrance remained the same and had not changed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this body spray and was kind if disappointed it didn&#x27;t smell anything like it should all I could smell was rubbing alcohol.</li>
    <li> Delicious! Bought it for my daughter and smells delicious...just like cotton candy!</li>
    <li> I love this since Victoria&#x27;s secret discontinued this from the store. I love this scent and the price is great!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on accident but i went ahead and smelled it anyways and it smells like alcohol and just a tad bit of cotton candy. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone who wants to smell good and girly and stuff.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is one of my favorites. I am a huge cotton candy fanatic, both taste and scent-wise. If you are, too, you will really like this one. It is very hard to find this online (Victoria&#x27;s Secret&#x27;s website doesn&#x27;t appear to have it listed), but I walked into the store just two days ago and found it. I love all the fragrances from the Beauty Rush line, and I wish they were more heavily carried. If you like body mists, give this a try. If you like lotions or shower gels, too, they make this, so go look this fragrance up.</li>
    <li> I was horrified to find out that is product had been discountinued, I loved the smell, feel (oil based), and the way it lasted all day. When I got this product I realized that it only had a faint scent and it smelled like rubbing alcohol when I smelled the top, needless to say I&#x27;ve wasted my money. Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> I love this scent!  Awesome sweet spun sugar yummy!  I felt lucky to fid it on amazon.  I recommend men will love it as much as you.</li>
    <li> Candy Baby yeah!! Thanks so much to Victorias Secret for bringing out this fun, sweet, addictive fragrance mist. My favourite time to put it on is bed time! I love going to bed smelling so delicious!!</li>
    <li> love love love, wish the scent lasted a bit longer tho</li>
    <li> Amazing, yummy, and flirty scent!!! It&#x27;s a combination of Vanilla meets Cotton Candy. Love the soft dry down too. HOWEVER, only three stars as the scent fades almost as quickly as I spray it on. My kids seem to like the smell more than adults. So I may just end up giving it to my daughter.</li>
    <li> I love this scent however the spray and lotion received smelled old. Maybe it was diluted? Either way, go to Victorias Secret!</li>
    <li> pricey but worth it.  she absolutely loves it and wont wear anything else.  she always smells sweet.  Like candy. Get it while you can cause they were almost sold out and very hard to find</li>
    <li> Victoria&#x27;s Secret needs to bring this one, and A Slice of Heaven back, men love these scents! My husband and sons selected these scents out of all the scents in the store, and every man I work with wants to know where to get it for his wife or girlfriend!</li>
    <li> This is a great scent and its lasts through the day. My 7yr old has also fallen in love with it. Its not an overbearing smell either</li>
    <li> My daughter was disappointed to find out this product has been discontinued so when she got it she was surprised and very happy.  I hope I can find it again soon.</li>
    <li> excellent body spray cant get any longer in canada. thanks for having it available we will be buying more for sure</li>
