      <li>Amazing lotion.</li>
      <li>The smell is also nice, but too overpowering for me.</li>
      <li>This is a nice scent for the spring.</li>
      <li>this product is moisturizing and not greasy; you really feel it penetrating your skin and the staying power of moisture is great!  </li>
      <li>smells great and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>best of all, it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
      <li>I love the feel of the cream on my skin.</li>

      <li>A favorite of mine.</li>
      <li>The Blood Orange is so refreshing.</li>
      <li>Love the organic ingredents because it delievers the things your skin needs the most.  </li>
      <li>Although I have to keep ordering more, my guests love it.</li>
      <li>one of my favorite body creams.  </li>
      <li>I have really enjoyed the Coconut version of this lotion</li>
      <li>fortunately, the smell does dissipate for the most part over time, so this is not a problem.  </li>
      <li>Since it comes in a tube, it is not so easy to get ALL of it out by squeezing the tube....</li>
      <li>but I do believe this will be fine for the summer months.</li>
      <li>Seems like it will be another that I enjoy.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my daughter as it&#x27;s gluten free.  </li>
      <li>Both are good as far as consistency and moisturizing go.  </li>
      <li>- it comes off strong at first, but fades quite quickly</li>
      <li>the smell is very true to the smell of a real orange</li>
      <li>so, I cut the tube in half when it no longer was easy to sqeeze the lotion out of it, and then I was able to scoop out quite a bit more</li>
      <li>not that I would eat this lotion, but chemicals are easily absorbed into the skin, so why would I want that.  </li>
      <li>However based on the ingredients, its what we don&#x27;t experience that proves its pureness.</li>
      <li>This is such a wonderful fragranced cream/lotion - it&#x27;s right in between - a little more &#x27;runny&#x27; than a cream, and a bit more stiff than a lotion.</li>
      <li>Since I am vegan/health conscious, I like knowing what I&#x27;m putting in my skin is such good quality.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really starting to love this companies products.</li>
      <li>The quality is obvious and the ingredients are top notch.</li>
      <li>I paid about $19 for the first time I bought it, then it was selling for about $13.  </li>
      <li>The scent is so fresh, clean and natural, and the lotion is very creamy, (but not sticky).</li>
      <li>Love 100% Pure products and especially this scent.</li>
      <li>This lotion is very emollient and it really smells like fresh oranges.</li>
      <li>This lotion is very moisturizing but not greasy.  </li>
      <li>Smell is hugely important and personal in buying a body lotion.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for providing a product that works so well.</li>
      <li>The orange version&#x27;s smell is very natural and pleasant, just like a fresh orange, while the raspberry is not pleasant at all.</li>
      <li>It moistures fairly well, though if you have very dry skin, you will need something with heavier body.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves a nice light orange/citrus scent behind for a little while, nothing major and won&#x27;t interfer with other scents.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>Keeps my skin soft.  </li>
      <li>(the same price as on original site of the company which produces it but with free shipment).&lt;br /&gt;I made investigations on that &amp;#34;scary&amp;#34; ingredient - nothing scary about it.</li>
      <li>I gave a bad review to another version of this lotion and want to make clear that I find that the lotion works great</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m addicted to hand lotion, and I wanted something more natural, but this is not for me.</li>
      <li>Also, some lotions are made to make your skin feel moist, but they contain chemicals that draw moisture from your internal body out to the surface of the skin so while your skin feels soft it is actually dehydrating your body.  </li>

<li> Depending on when you buy, and who the current seller is, this can vary in price, but whatever you pay - this is one lotion that has absolutely no chemicals in it.  </li>
<li> I hope someday soon I can find a natural one that will make my hands feel like Aveeno or Jergens does (no doubt that&#x27;s hard to do...).</li>
<li> It is a bit greasy but is expected due to the contents.</li>
<li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
<li> I would&#x27;ve expected less fragrance.</li>
<li> have bought several fragrances in this body cream and don&#x27;t have a complaint about any of them...</li>
<li> and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the smell interfering with my perfume; i&#x27;d say the smell lingers for maybe 30mins to an hour or so; very subtle hint of it on skin, but my coworkers tell me it&#x27;s not strong enough to overpower my perfume.  </li>
<li> I brought this lotion to a dry, cold climate and it wasn&#x27;t thick enough to handle the climate - my skin still dried out</li>
<li> A lot of \\&quot;natural\\&quot; companies have products with organic ingredients, but when you read their labels, there&#x27;s a whole lot of other crap in it.  </li>
<li> 3 stars for being organic, but I hate the way this makes my hands feel--oily but somehow still dry.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> We bought this because we recently studied all the adverse effects of home chemicals. Obviously there is no directly noticeable effects. However based on the ingredients, its what we don&#x27;t experience that proves its pureness.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter as it&#x27;s gluten free.  It smells yummy, moisturizes well and lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought several fragrances in this body cream and don&#x27;t have a complaint about any of them...wonderful smells, wonderful brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and just in case you were unsure...it&#x27;s vegan too.</li>
    <li> A favorite of mine. The scent and moisturizing is wonderful. Keeps my skin soft.  Thanks for providing a product that works so well.</li>
    <li> this product is so awesome . my skin glows</li>
    <li> 3 stars for being organic, but I hate the way this makes my hands feel--oily but somehow still dry. I&#x27;m bummed. I&#x27;m addicted to hand lotion, and I wanted something more natural, but this is not for me. I hope someday soon I can find a natural one that will make my hands feel like Aveeno or Jergens does (no doubt that&#x27;s hard to do...). The smell is also nice, but too overpowering for me. I would&#x27;ve expected less fragrance.</li>
    <li> This should be called skin food...because it gives your skin the food it needs.  Love the organic ingredents because it delievers the things your skin needs the most.  Keeps my skin looking very youthful! :D</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff!  Every time I hug someone they tell me how good I smell! Since I am vegan/health conscious, I like knowing what I&#x27;m putting in my skin is such good quality.  Although I have to keep ordering more, my guests love it. Also, I use the coconut one in the summer.</li>
    <li> This lotion is very moisturizing but not greasy.  The light orange scent is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really starting to love this companies products. The quality is obvious and the ingredients are top notch. This body cream smells so good and feels evens better! It is a bit greasy but is expected due to the contents.</li>
    <li> The lotion has a very pleasant light smell, absorbs into the skin without feeling greasy. The only problem I encountered was the cap appeared to be defective and in order for me to use it, I have to keep taking the cap on and off.</li>
    <li> Amazing lotion. smells great and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> Love this brand, no chemicals !</li>
    <li> Love 100% Pure products and especially this scent. The Blood Orange is so refreshing. The lotion soaks in well and is never greasy.</li>
    <li> This lotion is very emollient and it really smells like fresh oranges. A second one is already in my shopping cart.</li>
    <li> Smell is hugely important and personal in buying a body lotion.  I have really enjoyed the Coconut version of this lotion: I&#x27;m on my third bottle of that.  But I thought I&#x27;d branch out a bit and try another version.  I haven&#x27;t applied it yet to my skin, but I peeled off the protecting layer and sniffed it.  Seems like it will be another that I enjoy.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the cream. I love the feel of the cream on my skin. And the cost is the best. (the same price as on original site of the company which produces it but with free shipment).&lt;br /&gt;I made investigations on that &amp;#34;scary&amp;#34; ingredient - nothing scary about it. It does not look like that it will cause any harm, especially when I read that Chinese people use this plant in a tea to treat cold/fever.</li>
    <li> I do not write reviews that often but I am writing this to be fair to the brand.  I gave a bad review to another version of this lotion and want to make clear that I find that the lotion works great--it&#x27;s the fragrance that makes the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this lotion in the Blood Orange and Raspberry versions.  Both are good as far as consistency and moisturizing go.  The orange version&#x27;s smell is very natural and pleasant, just like a fresh orange, while the raspberry is not pleasant at all.</li>
    <li> this product is moisturizing and not greasy; you really feel it penetrating your skin and the staying power of moisture is great!  the smell is very true to the smell of a real orange and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the smell interfering with my perfume; i&#x27;d say the smell lingers for maybe 30mins to an hour or so; very subtle hint of it on skin, but my coworkers tell me it&#x27;s not strong enough to overpower my perfume.  A++++++++ product and company; would def do bsns with again and recommend to friends/fam!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t quite have that slick feeling of the other lotions loaded with chemicals, but it does work well and is totally worth switching to. I also like the Orange fragrance - it comes off strong at first, but fades quite quickly so it&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
    <li> one of my favorite body creams.  I buy this stuff constantly!  Smells great ;o)</li>
    <li> The scent is so fresh, clean and natural, and the lotion is very creamy, (but not sticky). A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is a nice scent for the spring. I brought this lotion to a dry, cold climate and it wasn&#x27;t thick enough to handle the climate - my skin still dried out but I do believe this will be fine for the summer months. The best is that it doesn&#x27;t contain harmful ingredients.</li>

It moistures fairly well, though if you have very dry skin, you will need something with heavier body.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves a nice light orange/citrus scent behind for a little while, nothing major and won&#x27;t interfer with other scents.&lt;br /&gt;And best of all, it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
    <li> Depending on when you buy, and who the current seller is, this can vary in price, but whatever you pay - this is one lotion that has absolutely no chemicals in it.  A lot of \\&quot;natural\\&quot; companies have products with organic ingredients, but when you read their labels, there&#x27;s a whole lot of other crap in it.  I for one prefer not to put anything on my skin that I wouldn&#x27;t eat....not that I would eat this lotion, but chemicals are easily absorbed into the skin, so why would I want that.  Also, some lotions are made to make your skin feel moist, but they contain chemicals that draw moisture from your internal body out to the surface of the skin so while your skin feels soft it is actually dehydrating your body.  Chemicals have a way of fooling nature, but there is always a price to pay for it.  The fragrance of this is a bit strong though very pleasant when you put it on.....fortunately, the smell does dissipate for the most part over time, so this is not a problem.  I paid about $19 for the first time I bought it, then it was selling for about $13.  Since it comes in a tube, it is not so easy to get ALL of it out by squeezing the tube....so, I cut the tube in half when it no longer was easy to sqeeze the lotion out of it, and then I was able to scoop out quite a bit more so it wouldn&#x27;t be wasteful.</li>
    <li> Best product for my skin. Not too greasy and the smell is wonderful.</li>
