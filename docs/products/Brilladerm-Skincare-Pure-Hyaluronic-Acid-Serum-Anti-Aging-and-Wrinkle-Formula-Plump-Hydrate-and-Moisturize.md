      <li>It firms the skin and does make me look better.</li>
      <li>A friend recommended Brilladerm to me and I am so glad.</li>
      <li>You can tell this is a better substance</li>
      <li>This has 5% alcohol the most allowed.  </li>
      <li>but I am so glad I did.</li>
      <li>My face is softer, smoother and more radiant...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than a year</li>

      <li>Shipping was quick and arrived as scheduled!</li>
      <li>love that it&#x27;s super lightweight</li>
      <li>I was not required to write a positive review &amp; the opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>

      <li>AND it&#x27;s  also Vegan, Paraben Free, Cruelty Free, Oil-free and contains no dyes, fragrances or fillers!&lt;br</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a great moisturizer that is not too heavy or oily.</li>

      <li>, it&#x27;s well worth trying.</li>
      <li>I notice a firming and uplifting effect right away.</li>
      <li>I use it right after I get out of the shower</li>
      <li>I really like that there is no fragrance as so many of these fragrances that are added to serums such as this are just cheap chemical fillers.  </li>
      <li>I have a good complexion, but have noticed a little dryness around my ear as the season has changed.</li>
      <li>My skin feels so soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I have only used it for a week, but at this point, I&#x27;m pretty sure I will be purchasing it again.</li>
      <li>So glad I got this product to open the fountain of youth for me.</li>
      <li>and you most definitely can put your face crèmes on over it.</li>
      <li>You can put your astringent on first and when it dries put on the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.</li>
      <li>I have enjoyed using it very much &amp; recommend it very highly for tiny lines around the eyes &amp; especially around the top lip where those lines try to take over.  </li>
      <li>I also started having my husband use this Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum by Brilladerm Skincare on his hands as well.  </li>
      <li>it certainly did.</li>
      <li>apply this Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum on my entire face, neck and decollete to help keep my skin young and wrinkle free!  </li>
      <li>This serum has really helped heal his hands and helped keep them moisturized</li>
      <li>I just put a drop or two on a finger tip and gently apply it to my face and decollete.  </li>
      <li>The dropper cap is very convenient.</li>
      <li>Only a couple of drops and my face feels soft and smooth!  </li>
      <li>So much better than any other face product I have ever tried.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this product since I use my super soft face leaves people and they tell me about the change in my face , this soft and have a more even tone with other creams that my dermatologist prescribed me use it.</li>
      <li>gladly recommend this product to anyone who has dark spots on their face, neck, hands, etc.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but I love how hydrated my skin feels even several hours after application...</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend it</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>formula from Brilladerm is so pure and clear.  </li>
      <li>I let it dry, and then I put my facial moisturizer on top before I put on my make-up.  </li>
      <li>It really does only take 2-3 drops to cover my whole face.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s winter (super dry air) and this is all the moisturizer I need.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best skin care product I have used! %100 recommended</li>
    <li> Very good product. I notice a softening of my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I love this! It leaves my skin feeling so soft. It isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy and it doesn&#x27;t smell like others that I have tried. I have been using it morning and night for the last 3 days and I love it.</li>
    <li> This product is great!! I have started taking better care of my face since receiving this product. My face feels and looks so much better!</li>
    <li> Obsessed with this. Only thing that has cured my dry skin &amp; rejuvenated my skin by adding fullness to my cheeks where my skin was very thin. &amp; I&#x27;m 22 years old so you would think my skin wouldn&#x27;t need fullness..it certainly did. This gave me the same effect as a plasma facial (blood facial), but has had lasting results. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love it! The second morning after I had used it, I remember waking up and, out of the blue, thinking, &amp;#34;Wow, my face actually feels moisturized&amp;#34;, which is saying a lot for living in Arizona! I would TOTALLY recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! love it!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.  It melts into the skin &amp; leaves no sticky residue.  I have enjoyed using it very much &amp; recommend it very highly for tiny lines around the eyes &amp; especially around the top lip where those lines try to take over.  I intend to stay with this product &amp; hope that you feel like you could at least give it a try.  The four star rating is simply because of the very small bottle.  I think the amount of product needs to be increased.  Other than that,  no complaints at all...give it a try &amp; be surprised.  I did receive this product in exchange for an honest review!</li>
    <li> I got this serum on a promotional price. So I tried it as soon as the package came&lt;br /&gt;I washed my face moisturized and put Brilladerm Skincare Serum everynight&lt;br /&gt;I did notice a brightening effect on my face and it became smoother. I liked the effect it gave me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks now and I think it really has helped take away some of the fine wrinkles that were creeping in around my eyes. It really does only take 2-3 drops to cover my whole face. I&#x27;ve found that I like to follow with an inexpensive lotion.</li>
    <li> orderd a hyalouric product before, no this brand and it was like applying water to my face.  You can tell this is a better substance and it seems a good quality but it seems to be drying out my skin.  I will try less amount.  I also heard that adding alcohol to hyaluronic acid will deplete it&#x27;s benefits.  This has 5% alcohol the most allowed.  Perhaps for me this is not a good thing.</li>
    <li> I have loved using Brilladerm Skincare Hyaluronic Acid Serum!!  I use it right after I get out of the shower and it has made my face feel so much younger.  My skin feels tighter and smoother as well.  So glad I got this product to open the fountain of youth for me.</li>
    <li> I am just starting to try it. I think it is a good buy. Thank for all the information about the product.</li>
    <li> Not sure about this product, I feel like it&#x27;s not penatrating into my skin. Don&#x27;t feel like it absorbs, when I put a moisturizer on afterward, I notice a film on my face, I feel like I&#x27;m taking it off. I guess it&#x27;s just best to use before bed alone, apply it then pat it in.</li>
    <li> I have used the Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum for the past few weeks, and am very satisfied with my results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gladly recommend this product to anyone who has dark spots on their face, neck, hands, etc. and want to get rid of them or if you just want to lighten your complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, to truly get maximum results, you must continue the serum regimen. This isn&#x27;t like acne cream, where you apply when a pimple pops-up, this type of serum is a way of life if you want to maintain healthier and younger-looking skin.  Basically, if you&#x27;re of the mind-set that you can diet Monday thru Friday, and take weekends-off to reward yourself, who are you kidding?  Yourself!  Same as this type of skin care. This is not a quick fix, nor an over-night miracle. The benefits will keep you on target, because your results will impress you, and your friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product at a savings price, or it is supplied to me in exchange for the purposes of a product review. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest &amp; unbiased opinion. Yours may differ from mine.</li>
    <li> This is excellent - I like the pure formula - being able to control what I put on my face.  This is great !!!</li>
    <li> The process went well.  Received product in a timely fashion.  Feels good and smells OK.  I am waiting to see any changes in my skin.</li>
    <li> Nice and lightweight. A little goes a long way. I will order it again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product I highly recommend it. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I notice a firming and uplifting effect right away. I use this twice a day and have seen some cumulative improvements. This serum has noticeably smoothed and plumped the fine lines underneath the outer corners of my eyes and used in conjunction with your moisturizer you will seriously take years off your face. My face is softer, smoother and more radiant... Someone recently told me that my face was glowing! it absorbs very quickly and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts. I also appreciate that a very small amount goes a long way, and I found that after using it for a few weeks, the serum leaves skin even-toned, smooth and clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample or discount in exchange for my honest review. I was not required to write a positive review &amp; the opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I am a die hard fan of Hyaluronic Acid and it&#x27;s part of my everyday skincare routines!  Hyaluronic Acid does amazing things for the skin it&#x27;s a brilliant moisturizer but it also helps improve the tone &amp; texture of your skin and helps diminish the look of fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I apply this Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum on my entire face, neck and decollete to help keep my skin young and wrinkle free!  I also started having my husband use this Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum by Brilladerm Skincare on his hands as well.  He works in construction but he primarily lays tile so his hand and fingers get really dried out and they crack and bleed.  This serum has really helped heal his hands and helped keep them moisturized so they don&#x27;t crack like they used to!  This is seriously great stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I love that it&#x27;s super lightweight so it absorbs instantly, it&#x27;s non-greasy so it works well for all skin types AND it&#x27;s  also Vegan, Paraben Free, Cruelty Free, Oil-free and contains no dyes, fragrances or fillers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I did receive this product at a discount or complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  However, I was not paid in anyway and my thoughts and opinions are my own.***</li>
    <li> Definitely makes my face softer than any other product I&#x27;ve used before.  Love it!</li>
    <li> My order arrived on time and is exactly what I expected. I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but I love how hydrated my skin feels even several hours after application...a couple of drops is all that is needed. The price point is excellent and next time I will order two bottles!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than a year and it&#x27;s great. It firms the skin and does make me look better. The sunken look women get in their cheek area and the jowls that start to droop stay tighter and fuller not to mention the chicken neck look also is firmer. It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out and you most definitely can put your face crèmes on over it. You can put your astringent on first and when it dries put on the Hyaluronic Acid Serum. It&#x27;s not a permanent solution like Botox or surgery, which I&#x27;m not a fan of nor do I have the money, but to me, this is safer and just as effective based on the compliments I receive at how young I look or how great my skin looks and I&#x27;m 67. I use in morning and night and I highly recommend it, it&#x27;s well worth trying. BJ Johnson</li>
    <li> Just because I am a grandmother, doesn&#x27;t mean that I want to look like one.  I want to keep my youthful appearance as long as I possibly can.  The way I want to do this naturally my aging skin.  That&#x27;s why I choose to hydrate my skin while also reducing the appearance of small wrinkles with pure hyaluronic acid serum.  Both my husband and myself have been using Brilladerm&#x27;s HA, and we&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This formula from Brilladerm is so pure and clear.  Since there are no fillers to thicken it, the serum is a bit runny.  I am just careful when applying the serum.  I just put a drop or two on a finger tip and gently apply it to my face and decollete.  It leaves my skin feeling silky soft.  I let it dry, and then I put my facial moisturizer on top before I put on my make-up.  I really like that there is no fragrance as so many of these fragrances that are added to serums such as this are just cheap chemical fillers.  I don&#x27;t want that on my face.  The Brilladerm Skincare Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum is the best HA I have yet tried.</li>
    <li> Great product! Love the way it makes my skin feel!</li>
    <li> I recommend this product since I use my super soft face leaves people and they tell me about the change in my face , this soft and have a more even tone with other creams that my dermatologist prescribed me use it. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this! I only use two drops for my face and neck morning and night. My skin feels so soft and smooth. It&#x27;s winter (super dry air) and this is all the moisturizer I need. Way impressed!</li>
    <li> So far this is working great! Big improvement in facial line reduction in only one week! Shipping was quick and arrived as scheduled! Loving it!</li>
    <li> So far, so good. My husband and I have been using this morning and night since receiving it. We both agree that our skin is not as dry, and that&#x27;s saying a lot during the dry winter months. It has helped clear up a dry spot I had under my eye. I have also noticed that my skin tone has evened out, and I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks. We recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I have been LOVING this!  A friend recommended Brilladerm to me and I am so glad. I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but I have been so impressed with this from the start. First off, it arrived very quickly, which is great when you are excited to use something. Then, upon trying it, I felt like it really smoothed and tightened my skin and did not feel heavy or greasy. I tend to use about 3 drops for my face, forehead and neck. So, there is another bonus - it should last for quite some time and is very reasonably priced. Great product!</li>
    <li> Great product!!  Only a couple of drops and my face feels soft and smooth!  So much better than any other face product I have ever tried.  I will definitely keep using this product.</li>
    <li> Love using this underneath my eyes everyday!</li>
    <li> Bought this product and I love it! Makes my skin look and feel amazing!</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this to me. I admit I was a little hesitant to try it but I am so glad I did. I have only used it for a week, but at this point, I&#x27;m pretty sure I will be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for over a week now and I love it! It&#x27;s a great moisturizer that is not too heavy or oily. I wear it under my hydrating bb cream and it gives my skin an extra healthy glow and smooth texture. I have oily skin, so in the past moisturizers have caused breakouts but this product has not. If my face gets too dry it blocks my pores and I break out, so it&#x27;s been such a good product to balance my skin and keep it healthy and younger looking.</li>
    <li> The perfect solution for drying skin or average skin! I have a good complexion, but have noticed a little dryness around my ear as the season has changed. This Brilladerm Skincare Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum has instantly smoothed out the bumps and redness on and around my ear. I love it! Compared to other wrinkle reducers and facial moisturizers, this product is much less intrusive in my morning routine. It is not bulky or oily. It is viscous enough to put on my fingers and pat onto my face. The dropper cap is very convenient.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; products!  Brilladerm is a favorite by far.  One suggestion, better packaging!  Mine was leaking when it arrived.</li>
