### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>While I wouldn&#x27;t make this my every-day at-home shower companion, it does have a niche for which it is perfect.</li>
      <li>I got a chance to try this and am very happy with it.  </li>
      <li>Best of all, you can squeeze it into a travel bottle and have an all-in-one wash to take with you when you travel.....</li>
      <li>I like the way it feels and am very happy with this.  </li>
      <li>I am very happy with this Axe 3-in-1 wash.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s very good for what it does.  </li>
      <li>It is a 3 in 1 product that is great for people like me.  </li>
      <li>It lathers well and smells nice, excellent for use after exercise.</li>
      <li>My hair felt great after using it.</li>
      <li>This is another great product from Axe.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is great for that purpose.</li>
      <li>Very nice scent too.</li>
      <li>This is very nicely scented, and while it may be intended for men, in fact works just as well for women.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant aroma and does a great job of cleaning you from head to toe.  </li>
      <li>Great bodywash, good scent..not pungent or overpowering.</li>
      <li>It’s not the best hair care product, but it works fine.</li>
      <li>I have been using one Axe product as both shampoo and conditioner and from time to time I’ve used it as a body wash with good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And while I still retain a good head of hair, I am cognizant of plugging hair roots with detergent residues and stopping hair growth.  </li>
      <li>and I dont need a lot of stuff to make my hair feel good.  </li>
      <li>Despite being a good product, great packaging, and smelling good, they didn&#x27;t let success get to their head and blow up the price.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was the cheap body wash that we were using (which I had picked up after we ran out of the really awesome Neutrogena body wash that is just a bit out of my price range right now), but he was really happy to have this Axe 3 body wash.</li>
      <li>However, I tried AX body soap tonight, and I liked it too.</li>
      <li>My husband’s feeling, and I agree, is that this is basically a body wash that you can kind of use as a shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Axe products.  </li>
      <li>This is an excellent product that covers all the bases nicely for a decent price.</li>
      <li>It lathers up well but doesn&#x27;t spread very easily.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Since the smell isn&#x27;t strong, I decided to try it on myself after I ran out of my own body wash.  </li>
      <li>shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>And most bath soaps advertise that they have deodorant properties, so why not combine that feature as well?&lt;br</li>
      <li>For many guys though this will be one of those &amp;#34;why</li>
      <li>Also, I was worried the top might not stay shut, in my gym bag.</li>
      <li>Axe is my man&#x27;s favorite body spray.</li>
      <li>I love anything that saves me valuable time in the mornings.</li>
      <li>okay shampoo.  </li>
      <li>a much better alternative to most hotel soaps and shampoos.</li>
      <li>I am okay with 2 in 1 shampoos with conditioner.</li>
      <li>If you have longer hair, it’s best to use an actual shampoo.</li>
      <li>Most people are probably going to fall into one of two categories when it comes to products like this</li>
      <li>product works well in getting everything clean and it has a nice smell to it.</li>
      <li>Very clean</li>
      <li>Add to that a great shampoo and color me surprised.</li>
      <li>Axe 3 in 1 body wash, shampoo &amp; conditioner in Total fresh scent smells great like most Axe products and cleans effectively.</li>
      <li>/&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Container is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t slip from my hands</li>
      <li>I am accustomed to conditioners that use oils to make my hair smoother and easy to comb, but this conditioner doesn&#x27;t seem to have that effect.</li>
      <li>Scent isn&#x27;t too strong or flowery.</li>
      <li>For those that are not bothered either by smelling strongly (for a l-o-n-g t-i-m-e after washing), and/or an extended yucky, tingling taste (see comments below list):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>you like it, note that one of the reasons I rated it highly is that it is being sold at a fair price, not the lowest</li>
      <li>But since it is, fine.</li>
      <li>This is a fine product, and would be well suited for travel, camping, or dormitory life in which the combination of shampoo and conditioner and body wash</li>
      <li>Besides the color, it cleanses just fine.  </li>
      <li>The product will still work fine, but it won&#x27;t be a one bottle</li>
      <li>and we both enjoy using it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>great especially for camping trips.</li>
      <li>So I was pleasantly surprised that this Ade 3 in 1 body wash with shampoo and conditioner was a good product.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very handy especially since it&#x27;s 3 in 1</li>
      <li>for performance, it can&#x27;t be compared to using best quality individual items, but for my busy days, this is time saving</li>
      <li>, but it&#x27;s substantial, and I do feel clean after using it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is an excellent combo wash, though it does not lather as thick as the Axe dedicated shampoos, it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The scent is mild, not overpowering, and clean smelling.  </li>
      <li>and I loved that I only had to use one product during my shower.</li>
      <li>I’ve found I am leaning more and more to the second category.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a fresh-scented, blue wash, perfect for sudsing up net type sponges for bath.</li>
      <li>It isnt overpowering and actually is pretty light.  </li>
      <li>They cut down the bathroom clutter, are great for travel</li>
      <li>As with regular Axe body washes the scent was great and very masculine.</li>
      <li>I like the mild scent, and masculine shape of the container along with silhouette on the back of an attractive woman washing a man&#x27;s hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice extra, that maybe contributes to the softness of one&#x27;s hair after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice big bottle as well</li>
      <li>and you don&#x27;t need a whole lot of soap to do the task at hand with each dispense, so it should last for a good while.</li>
      <li>If your man can get past the brilliant blue color, he will surely appreciate the &amp;#34;one stop shopping&amp;#34; convenience this provides.  </li>
      <li>For a guy, having all three things in one bottle might be the right way to go.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After all, it is pretty well accepted these days to combine shampoo with conditioner, right?</li>
      <li>It left what hair I have feeling soft and that&#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>It makes sense for this product to be big because you use much more of the stuff per</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be back for more</li>
      <li>I can only give the product 4 stars as I think a dedicated shampoo gives my hair a bit more body.</li>
      <li>The only caveat is that it isn&#x27;t great when my hair starts to get really long</li>
      <li>It’s better for short hair.</li>
      <li>Axe 3 in 1 Shampoo + Conditioner + Body Wash, Total Fresh 22 ounce does indeed have a fresh, clean scent.</li>
      <li>In spite of my expectations, I actually felt very clean after using it from head to toe.  </li>
      <li>When I think of Axe personal care products I think of intense, but sexy, men&#x27;s scents.  </li>
      <li>As a shampoo-conditioner it is good for short hairs only.</li>
      <li>I am always left feeling fresh, and clean.</li>
      <li>Overall though, it is a great 3-in-1 product for the average person.</li>
      <li>… it is clean and goes with pretty much any occasion, such as work, visiting friends, or an evening out to dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So my suggestion is that if you fit into Category B described above go ahead and get a bottle of this and try it for yourself.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle, not harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>is there really that much fundamental difference between some of the products</li>
      <li>I really like Axe shampoo and bodywash products.  </li>
      <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I deducted stars not so much for that, but because my boyfriend can&#x27;t use this as shampoo because he says it dries out his scalp.</li>
      <li>No, when you close the top, it stays closed.</li>
      <li>For me, though it did get both my hair and skin clean, I don&#x27;t see it replacing separate shampoos and soaps I have gotten used to over a lifetime of social conditioning and media marketing.  </li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
      <li>I really had to put my nose up on his skin in order to smell anything.  </li>
      <li>… A) those who believe they need individual specially formulated “products” for each act of self-grooming, i.e. soap, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, deodorant, perfumes, and so on … and B) people who don’t really care.</li>
      <li>So not a bad choice overall.</li>
      <li>We both have fairly long hair, so a conditioner is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that this product has a clean scent and it doesn&#x27;t take much to perform the functions it&#x27;s designed to perform.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was expecting this, since most shampoo+conditioner combinations don&#x27;t feel the same as traditional conditioners.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re a regular at the gym, then you know that, between lockers, gym bags, and getting back and forth to the shower, it can be a pain to have too many things to bring along.</li>
      <li>I dont have oily hair, it is just normal</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Growing up in a third world country, one soap bar was all we had for our hair, face, and body.  Today we&#x27;ve made things complicated with shampoo, conditioner, facial soup, and body wash, etc.  Sometimes, I wished I had an all in one solution.  Now Axe 3 in 1 fulfills my wish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for performance, it can&#x27;t be compared to using best quality individual items, but for my busy days, this is time saving and it does the job satisfactorily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a busy man, I recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is a fine product, and would be well suited for travel, camping, or dormitory life in which the combination of shampoo and conditioner and body wash all in one would be advantageous.  I like the mild scent, and masculine shape of the container along with silhouette on the back of an attractive woman washing a man&#x27;s hair.  I can only give the product 4 stars as I think a dedicated shampoo gives my hair a bit more body.</li>
    <li> I really like Axe shampoo and bodywash products.  My teenager likes them a lot and steals mine whenever I get them so I end up buying another.  I got a chance to try this and am very happy with it.  I dont have oily hair, it is just normal and I dont need a lot of stuff to make my hair feel good.  This is where this product comes in.  It is a 3 in 1 product that is great for people like me.  I just want to add it once and wash it off.  This works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell.  It isnt overpowering and actually is pretty light.  I like the way it feels and am very happy with this.  The price isnt bad and I will definitely be buying this when I run out.  It is 22 ounces so it should last for a little while, unless my son steals this one and I need to buy one right away.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what day I received this item. It was either Friday or Saturday but it was picked up by my son at the post box by Sunday evening. I don&#x27;t know if it was the cheap body wash that we were using (which I had picked up after we ran out of the really awesome Neutrogena body wash that is just a bit out of my price range right now), but he was really happy to have this Axe 3 body wash. He hasn&#x27;t used it as a shampoo but as the body wash, he said it makes a difference for him. Scent isn&#x27;t too strong or flowery. It has a subtle clean scent that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now he has a bodywash that he can put down as an item to buy.</li>
    <li> Axe is my man&#x27;s favorite body spray. He loves this 3 in body wash and shampoo and conditioner all in one. When traveling -- instead of 3 bottles, he just has one and the smell is AHmazing!</li>
    <li> This is another great product from Axe.  It has a pleasant aroma and does a great job of cleaning you from head to toe.  It leaves my hair soft and shiny as well as cleans and moisturizes my body.  Best of all, you can squeeze it into a travel bottle and have an all-in-one wash to take with you when you travel..... a much better alternative to most hotel soaps and shampoos.</li>
    <li> Most people are probably going to fall into one of two categories when it comes to products like this … A) those who believe they need individual specially formulated “products” for each act of self-grooming, i.e. soap, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, deodorant, perfumes, and so on … and B) people who don’t really care. I’ve found I am leaning more and more to the second category. I have to ask is there really that much fundamental difference between some of the products I use?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, it is pretty well accepted these days to combine shampoo with conditioner, right? Why not use the same product as a body wash? And most bath soaps advertise that they have deodorant properties, so why not combine that feature as well?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the feel and fragrance of Axe products and I have used some of their similar products before, in fact before ordering this bottle I have been using one Axe product as both shampoo and conditioner and from time to time I’ve used it as a body wash with good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I like the idea … less packaging waste, less choices to make, less clashing of fragrances, and less waste. I like that the “Total Fresh” fragrance doesn’t make me smell like I fell into a tank of perfume … it is clean and goes with pretty much any occasion, such as work, visiting friends, or an evening out to dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that cosmetics are highly personal. Whether someone here rates this product as 5-star or 1-star really doesn’t mean a thing if you don’t like it, does it? So my suggestion is that if you fit into Category B described above go ahead and get a bottle of this and try it for yourself. I can’t think of anything at all negative about it (like it doesn’t eat your skin away or turn you green or clog your drains).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like it, note that one of the reasons I rated it highly is that it is being sold at a fair price, not the lowest but then again Axe is a major brand name.</li>
    <li> Total Fresh is not my favorite Axe scent, but it isn’t bad. My husband’s feeling, and I agree, is that this is basically a body wash that you can kind of use as a shampoo and conditioner. It’s not the best hair care product, but it works fine. It’s better for short hair. If you have longer hair, it’s best to use an actual shampoo.</li>
    <li> Great bodywash, good scent..not pungent or overpowering. Smell stays for sometime not long though as you may expect. As a shampoo-conditioner it is good for short hairs only. If you keep your hair long and style the, I&#x27;d suggest using other special brands like Mitch or American Crew.</li>
    <li> Axe 3 in 1 body wash, shampoo &amp; conditioner in Total fresh scent smells great like most Axe products and cleans effectively. My son loves these body wash &amp; shampoo combos so this works for him. 5/5 stars</li>
    <li> 3 1/2 Stars:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fine body wash, okay shampoo.  Perhaps the manufacturer and I have different ideas about what a conditioner is supposed to do, but I think it should be restoring oil and texture.  That&#x27;s not happening with this product but it&#x27;s very good for what it does.  Very nice scent too.</li>
    <li> I like this product for several reasons.  It is three products in one and each use - shampoo, conditioner and body wash - seem to do the job they are supposed to do.  It suds quickly with a small amount of product - a pool about the size of a quarter.  The scent is mild, not overpowering, and clean smelling.  It rinses off and leaves no residue.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to think of this product. The advertising blitz when they brought the product out a few years ago, with the women going wild for any man who wore AXE, was just a bit &#x27;MUCH&#x27; for me. You see the brand loaded on the grocery store shelves, next to the Old Spice. However, I tried AX body soap tonight, and I liked it too. The dark blue gel, when you squeeze a bit out, foams up really nice. You don&#x27;t need much. The scent of the soap is barely noticeable. I hate strong fragrance in soap, so I appreciate that. I could wash up my hair, and my body. Since I shower at the gym, I was looking for one product to just throw into the bag. Also, I was worried the top might not stay shut, in my gym bag. If the soap wasn&#x27;t secure, that would be a mess. No, when you close the top, it stays closed. This bottle will last me at least 3 months. I haven&#x27;t been attacked my mobs of women like in the commercial, though. I hope that wasn&#x27;t false advertising.</li>
    <li> This is very nicely scented, and while it may be intended for men, in fact works just as well for women. The shampoo component leaves hair feeling soft, and clean, not as one might expect from harsh body soap. It&#x27;s gentle, not harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a conditioner, it is subtle. Normally I do not use conditioner, and if it were not included here, I wouldn&#x27;t bother. But since it is, fine. It&#x27;s a nice extra, that maybe contributes to the softness of one&#x27;s hair after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a body wash, this falls down slightly. It does not easily remove the day&#x27;s deodorant, and does not leave one feeling quite as squeaky clean as soap, even glycerin soap. After use, regular soap was required.</li>
    <li> When I think of Axe personal care products I think of intense, but sexy, men&#x27;s scents.  So when I had to ask if my boyfriend had used it after having it in the shower for several days, you can imagine my surprise when he told me he had been using it but I couldn&#x27;t even smell anything, even immediately after coming out of the shower.  I really had to put my nose up on his skin in order to smell anything.  It smells good, but it&#x27;s VERY faint.  In other words, nobody is going to swoon or anything over this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I deducted stars not so much for that, but because my boyfriend can&#x27;t use this as shampoo because he says it dries out his scalp. He can only use it for body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the smell isn&#x27;t strong, I decided to try it on myself after I ran out of my own body wash.  Can I just say &amp;#34;holy electric blue, Batman!&amp;#34;  This stuff looks like it could glow in the dark, it&#x27;s such a strange blue color. Besides the color, it cleanses just fine.  My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry or anything after using it.  Now I&#x27;m just using this as my daily body wash until we run out, but I don&#x27;t see myself going out of my way to every buy this in the future.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent combo wash, though it does not lather as thick as the Axe dedicated shampoos, it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a fresh-scented, blue wash, perfect for sudsing up net type sponges for bath. I am always left feeling fresh, and clean. I am very happy with this Axe 3-in-1 wash.</li>
    <li> This blue gel shampoo doesn&#x27;t have much fragrance. The scent is similar to menthol without the smokiness. It lathers up well but doesn&#x27;t spread very easily.  If used as a body wash right out of the bottle it will not last long  but a little squirted on a wash cloth will go a long way. My hair fluffs up too high after use and I end up wetting it down. If you use a hair gel you probably won&#x27;t notice. Although it leaves my hair fluffier my hair seems to keep it&#x27;s shape and doesn&#x27;t get windblown. I don&#x27;t like this product as a body wash. It leaves my skin feeling slippery but it does make my skin softer.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product that covers all the bases nicely for a decent price. It&#x27;s a nice big bottle as well and you don&#x27;t need a whole lot of soap to do the task at hand with each dispense, so it should last for a good while. I also like the combined aspects of shampoo+condition+body wash. I mean, who wants to buy three different formulas and deal with all that switcheroo when you&#x27;re trying to a shower or bath? Combining things into one source is the way of the world these days, so why not shampoo. It&#x27;s all in one bottle and it&#x27;s a time and money saver. You can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> So shampoo, body wash and conditioner all in one. Because why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works well in getting everything clean and it has a nice smell to it. It left what hair I have feeling soft and that&#x27;s good. So not a bad choice overall.</li>
    <li> For those that are not bothered either by smelling strongly (for a l-o-n-g t-i-m-e after washing), and/or an extended yucky, tingling taste (see comments below list):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Container is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t slip from my hands&lt;br /&gt;-The gel is thick so not too much extra down the drain like some less viscous washes&lt;br /&gt;-It lathers well (interestingly enough, the lather isn&#x27;t as thick-feeling as that from [[ASIN:B000FPVM5W DOUX Shea Butter Soaps 250g (oval)-Mimosa]], but it&#x27;s substantial, and I do feel clean after using it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-My bed now smells of this scent :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it last night for my before-going-to-bed-shower, and this morning to wash my face, head, &amp; armpits. I guess I&#x27;m just not into the lingering (to say the very least) scent (smell, really), nor the taste (yep, I have a mustache &amp; beard and this stuff gets on my lips and subsequently ((even an hour after washing my face)) into my mouth, and it really isn&#x27;t very tasty... especially with morning coffee!).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Axe products.  Despite being a good product, great packaging, and smelling good, they didn&#x27;t let success get to their head and blow up the price.  That said, I haven&#x27;t been a big fan of multi-function bath cleansers.  It&#x27;s the coating they leave that just makes it feel like you still need a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I think they have corrected that with this product.  In spite of my expectations, I actually felt very clean after using it from head to toe.  My hair wasn&#x27;t oily and my skin didn&#x27;t feel waxy as I honestly expected.  Being a little older my skin tends to be a bit dryer, so the moisturizing aspects of the product left my skin feeling pretty normal instead of dried out.  And while I still retain a good head of hair, I am cognizant of plugging hair roots with detergent residues and stopping hair growth.  Axe 3 in 1 leaves no such residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be back for more</li>
    <li> It does the job well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good scent. Not so overpowering.</li>
    <li> The biggest benefit of this product is you have just one container to manage. If you are going to use the gym/pool shower, it is a hassle to carry multiple bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle itself is big and contains 22 oz of product whereas standard size bottles contain only 14 oz. It makes sense for this product to be big because you use much more of the stuff per shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied with this product. It lathers well and smells nice, excellent for use after exercise. The shampoo and body wash aspect of it works very well, but the conditioner is not the same as traditional oil-based conditioners. I am accustomed to conditioners that use oils to make my hair smoother and easy to comb, but this conditioner doesn&#x27;t seem to have that effect. I was expecting this, since most shampoo+conditioner combinations don&#x27;t feel the same as traditional conditioners. If you have very dry or brittle hair, you may need to use a dedicated conditioner in addition to this product. Overall though, it is a great 3-in-1 product for the average person.</li>
    <li> Axe 3 in 1 Shampoo + Conditioner + Body Wash, Total Fresh 22 ounce does indeed have a fresh, clean scent. As shampoo and conditioner it does the job, and works just as well as body wash. For a guy, having all three things in one bottle might be the right way to go.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used this before. it&#x27;s very handy especially since it&#x27;s 3 in 1 meaning i don&#x27;t need to carry 3 bottles of stuff for cleaning.  great especially for camping trips.</li>
    <li> I have never been the biggest fan of 3 in 1 products. I am okay with 2 in 1 shampoos with conditioner. But when you add body wash to the mix, I start to have my doubts if a product can do what it promises. So I went into this product with reservations. So I was pleasantly surprised that this Ade 3 in 1 body wash with shampoo and conditioner was a good product. As with regular Axe body washes the scent was great and very masculine. Add to that a great shampoo and color me surprised. My hair felt great after using it. Very clean and I loved that I only had to use one product during my shower. I love anything that saves me valuable time in the mornings.</li>
    <li> Not only is this product a shampoo, conditioner and body wash all in one but it is a microcosm example of the difference between men and women.  A woman (me) wants a different product targeted for each specific need.  For example, the moisturizer I&#x27;d use on my face would never be the same one I&#x27;d use on my hands.  In fact, I might even have multiple products for different areas of my face!  In contrast, a man (my husband) would without hesitation, use a bar of deodorant soap to wash his hair if the shampoo bottle was empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Axe clearly knows their target audience with this 3 in 1 product.  If your man can get past the brilliant blue color, he will surely appreciate the &amp;#34;one stop shopping&amp;#34; convenience this provides.  For me, though it did get both my hair and skin clean, I don&#x27;t see it replacing separate shampoos and soaps I have gotten used to over a lifetime of social conditioning and media marketing.  For many guys though this will be one of those &amp;#34;why didn&#x27;t they think of this years ago&amp;#34; products.  I see this being a gym bag and travel kit staple of every guy in America.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve become a fan of 3 in 1 and 2 in 1 products in recent years.&lt;br /&gt;Finding products that have a gender neutral scent is a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;The multipurpose products work well for us.  They cut down the bathroom clutter, are great for travel and I think they save us money.&lt;br /&gt;Instead of purchasing a shampoo, a conditioner and a body wash individually, this one product does it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re both over 60 so we no longer battle oily hair or skin issues.  We both have fairly long hair, so a conditioner is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that this product has a clean scent and it doesn&#x27;t take much to perform the functions it&#x27;s designed to perform.&lt;br /&gt;Neither of us felt it left a greasy feeling behind and we both enjoy using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to have extra products on hand so we don&#x27;t have to run to the store for a single item or two.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s far easier to store extras when one product replaces 2 or 3 products.</li>
    <li> While I wouldn&#x27;t make this my every-day at-home shower companion, it does have a niche for which it is perfect. If you&#x27;re a regular at the gym, then you know that, between lockers, gym bags, and getting back and forth to the shower, it can be a pain to have too many things to bring along. I tend to work out in the evening, and just want to get cleaned up before I put street clothes back on to go home or wherever. This stuff is great for that purpose. One bottle does everything that situation requires. The only caveat is that it isn&#x27;t great when my hair starts to get really long and I desperately need a good quality conditioner to keep it in line. The product will still work fine, but it won&#x27;t be a one bottle solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is fine and neutral enough, especially after a rinse and a dry, that anyone can use it. There are a number of products like this, and for my purposes, I&#x27;m usually looking for a bargain that works. This will be on my list of ones that work.</li>
