      <li>Excellent for practicing my nail art,  I found it very useful and my fake nails fit on these fingers perfectly.</li>

      <li>I have no complaints they were cheap but just like the picture</li>

      <li>anyone who does nails often , your own or someone elses really needs these.</li>
      <li>My talented twelve year old daughter asked for these.</li>

      <li>Don&#x27;t think it would be good for doing just nail polish as it does not have free edge and has hollow points around it.</li>

      <li>She said they look real and are helpful.</li>
      <li>so I didnt really help me practice</li>
      <li>they are very helpful when you start the nail.</li>
      <li>Its better than buying straight out the beauty store like I usually do.</li>
      <li>i gave it a 5 star came early ,the fingers are the size of a pinkie finger I got five of them</li>
      <li>complete set.</li>
      <li>First I only got 2 fingers and it says 5 pieces, second the acrylics are to wide to slide on</li>

<li> First I only got 2 fingers and it says 5 pieces, second the acrylics are to wide to slide on</li>
<li> the nail part is a little high for acrylic</li>
<li> I filed it down like I would on a natural nail</li>
<li> and I would buy them again except they do take long since its from china so if its urgent not for you</li>
<li> They did take a long time to be delivered.</li>
<li> The nail bed is a bit smaller than I expected, but I believe I can make it work...</li>
<li> I have purchased these in the past from other retailers with no problem, but these are pure junk.</li>
<li> First off when I opened the package they were in a dirty old zip lock bag, no receipt (I have always received a receipt with my order).</li>
<li> Such a waste of money</li>
<li> these sucks DO NOT BUY WASTE OF MONEY I wish I could get my money back</li>
<li> Its really hard to work on a nail when the nail doesn&#x27;t stay.</li>
<li> it sucks because one of the fingers i received was broken</li>
<li> this is the reason why I bought them to practice on fake nails before and</li>
<li> was I wrong.</li>
<li> These were horrible to try and use, I will not be buying these again other people might like them</li>
<li> Seriously the worst product I&#x27;ve ever ordered there&#x27;s no way in hell you could glue on fake nails</li>
<li> Horrible product!</li>

    <li> these make things so much easier, I liked them so went back and bought 5 more. anyone who does nails often , your own or someone elses really needs these.</li>
    <li> Excellent for practicing my nail art,  I found it very useful and my fake nails fit on these fingers perfectly. would surely phurchase again</li>

    <li> My talented twelve year old daughter asked for these. She said they look real and are helpful. She looks forward to postings photos of her artistic work online.</li>
    <li> These were pretty cheap, but I figured it would be ok just to practice acrylic nails on boy was I wrong. First off when I opened the package they were in a dirty old zip lock bag, no receipt (I have always received a receipt with my order). Its really hard to work on a nail when the nail doesn&#x27;t stay. Will probably not repurchase!</li>
    <li> Great for learning how to apply acrylic. I will be ordering more. Don&#x27;t think it would be good for doing just nail polish as it does not have free edge and has hollow points around it.</li>
    <li> the nails on the mannequin arent very big. only one size nail fits on it so I didnt really help me practice</li>
    <li> These were horrible to try and use, I will not be buying these again other people might like them but i don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> i gave it a 5 star came early ,the fingers are the size of a pinkie finger I got five of them I seen the reviews about how glue don&#x27;t stick to them or the nail well I see why its too shiny but you can always ruff the nail up so you can glue it its call improvising and you can shape the nail finger how you want it to look that&#x27;s why its a practice finger so im happy with what I got and the pice was good :)</li>
    <li> Do not buy!!!! Horrible product! These fingers are so deformed. The picture makes them look better than they really are.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for school.  Glue would not set on these until I took my husbands dremmel to them.  They are standard practice fingers.  They did take a long time to be delivered.</li>
    <li> Seriously the worst product I&#x27;ve ever ordered there&#x27;s no way in hell you could glue on fake nails this is the reason why I bought them to practice on fake nails before and these sucks DO NOT BUY WASTE OF MONEY I wish I could get my money back</li>

    <li> I bought these and I am satisfied with them. The nail bed is a bit smaller than I expected, but I believe I can make it work... There isn&#x27;t a free edge for learning to put on the nail form but I will figure something out.</li>

    <li> Love these, perfect for trying on colors an acrylic nails . I glued them to a board to hang jewelry , very cool</li>
    <li> it sucks because one of the fingers i received was broken and i did not expect any of them to look the way they did...</li>
    <li> I know I ordered around hurricane sandy, so I understand why it took a while. But I bought this as a gift and I hope she loves it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 6 months and I never even seen it</li>
    <li> I have purchased these in the past from other retailers with no problem, but these are pure junk. It&#x27;s like there is no fingernail. I will not puchase from this company again.</li>
