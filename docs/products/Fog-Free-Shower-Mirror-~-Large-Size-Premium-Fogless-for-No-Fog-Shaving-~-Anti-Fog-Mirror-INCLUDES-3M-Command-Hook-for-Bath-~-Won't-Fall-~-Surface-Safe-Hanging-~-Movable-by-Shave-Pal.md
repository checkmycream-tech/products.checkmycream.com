<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I dig it, does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to, doesn&#x27;t fog it you warm it up (just like you have to do with any shower mirror) only not pick I can say is I wish it shed water a little better because it tends to hold a lot of beaded up water on the service of the mirror. I love having it on the hook though as it makes warming and cleaning it super easy</li>
    <li> I like this little mirror.  Hangs easily!</li>
    <li> works great and the mirror is crystal clear</li>
    <li> CAUTION:  While the seller statement on fog is true, it is VERY MISLEADING.  This mirror fogs up within seconds!  The seller statement says &amp;#34;FOG FREE - Hold Shave Pal Under Shower Stream for a Few Seconds and Fog IS Eliminated.&amp;#34;  This is a true statement but READ CAREFULLY--this mirror is fog free only for about 10 seconds immediately after removing from the shower stream, then the fog returns!!!  So annoying to keep unhooking and placing under the shower stream every 10 seconds just to be able to use!  Also the shower mirror on a hook idea is weird----I&#x27;d rather have a shower mirror with a solid mount then one hanging by just a mere hook.  Not a fan of this purchase at all.  AVOID!</li>
    <li> So far this mirror is proving better than most of the suction-cup style shower mirrors.  We&#x27;ve got a linen-style tile in our bathroom, and this is the only thing that will really stick.  Suction cups no matter the style just don&#x27;t adhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just hold the mirror in the shower stream for 20 seconds or so, hang it back up and shave.  Unless you are super-slow, you&#x27;ll finish before it starts fogging up again.</li>
    <li> Great Product, I love it.</li>
    <li> Mirror NOT fog free - but I still like it.  All that needs done is to toss a cap full of hot water on the mirror and it clears up long enough to shave with the shower running.</li>
    <li> After years of needing such a thing, when I finally ordered a shower mirror the hot water heater died! I now look like a Hobo.</li>
    <li> Fogged instantly. Their &#x27;anti fog&#x27; is to run water over it if it fogs.... how the heck is that any different than any other mirror?</li>
    <li> My wife got this as a gift for me. And I must say I am unsatisfide completely... She got it so I can shave while I shower cause it&#x27;s not spoused to fog up but it fogs up and I can&#x27;t see my face to shave. I don&#x27;t understand how this is a premium fog free mirror when it fogs up. Won&#x27;t buy this again or for anyone els for a gift that is for sure......</li>
    <li> Useful fo those who like to shave in the shower. Easy to fix it using its guide.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the hole in the middle of the top of the mirror. It would be nicer if it hung on the wall differently.</li>
    <li> ....it arrived as promised and was as described. The instructions were straight forward and easy to follow.  Mirror was up in less than five minutes. I have not had a problem with fogging up but there are detailed instructions for that as well. Very easy however it will not shave you nor decorate your Christmas Tree...:)</li>
    <li> works well, small, easy to mount, easy to defog, great price.</li>
    <li> did the job it was suppose to do.  good job</li>
    <li> this mirror works great if you follow the directions and hold it under the warm water before you begin - works just as advertised!</li>
    <li> Fog less?, well, not true, it has to be washed every second so you can see your self in it.</li>
    <li> Great shower mirror, but still gets fogged.</li>
    <li> It was inexpensive... so that&#x27;s awesome. It is certainly not fog free AT ALL... but if you rinse it off, it stays clear enough for my dude to shave. The hook has stayed attached to the shower wall as well, so 4 stars!</li>
    <li> This mirror is NOT fogless.  Every time I tried to shave in the show it fogs up continually.</li>
    <li> I worked really well, a little tricky if you never used a fog free mirror, i just needed a mirror to shave in the shower, fog free was a bonus :)</li>
    <li> So simple and it works. No fog at all, just place it under hot water for 10-15 seconds (back and front) and that&#x27;s it. Sticking the holder to the wall was also pretty simple.</li>
    <li> This is NOT a fog free mirror, don&#x27;t spend the money on this mirror if you want a fog free mirror!!  I&#x27;d return it but my husband won&#x27;t let me!</li>
    <li> This is a basic shower mirror.  Unlike others that try to integrate a battery powered light, a razor holder, a waterproof radio, and a bottle opener, this is simple a mirror.  It&#x27;s very light so if it falls off or if you drop it, it won&#x27;t break or slice off a toe.  It&#x27;s also a sturdy plastic (a thermosetting polycarbonate if I had to speculate), which - in a shower where you are in bare feet is preferrable to glass.  That being said - don&#x27;t try to scrub it with anything abrasive or scratchy.  It will ruin it.  I did that to my last one.  The mirror is plenty big enough and hangs on a hook attached with some kind of miracle adhesive tape developed from the area 51 crash.  Ten thousand years from now, advanced human archeologists will dig up the foundation of my house along with the hook and it&#x27;s adhesive and will speculate upon it&#x27;s use. I kid but the bottom line is, this mirror is perfect for what it is.  If you let the shower spray it for a moment, it doesn&#x27;t fog.  If you are too tall for anywhere it could be mounted as I am, just tilt the bottom forward and look slightly downward.  If it gets water spots on it, wipe it with vinegar.  If you love the way the sun hits your face and miss yourself when you are gone, tuck this baby into your fanny pack and pull it out any time you need to admire your stunningly noble visage.  The best part?  Unlimited reflections.  I swear, I have been unable to wear this thing out.</li>
    <li> For a shower mirror, this one is very good. It&#x27;s light, durable, large and convenient.</li>
    <li> Premium, schmium. It&#x27;s not fog free!  What makes a mirror fog free is when you heat it. If you run it under hot water for a while then it will be fog free – for a while. If vendors aren&#x27;t truthful then they don&#x27;t deserve five stars, yes or no?</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised and a great price!</li>
    <li> good product, reasonably priced. works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I have had many &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirrors and this one tops them all!  Easy to mount and rinse off.  Does not fog or streakwhile the shower is running. Works for me.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd fogless shower mirror i&#x27;ve owned and it&#x27;s the better of the two. You need to &amp;#34;preheat&amp;#34; it by running it under the water for it to be fogless. If you&#x27;re shaving your head, you&#x27;ll have to heat it up probably more than once but that&#x27;s not really a big deal. Also, i was hoping for a bigger mirror but i wasnt able to find anything better with decent feedback. So far, i like it and i would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great Product, Prompt Service, No Complaints, deserves 5 Stars</li>
    <li> As described. Easy care, great customer service</li>
    <li> The Shower Mirror is good, first mirrow that I can use in the shower, because the others always get fogged. Good Product!</li>
    <li> It will do what I need.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product but you have to follow the directions of heating it up with the shower water for 15 - 20 seconds in order for it to stay fog-free.  Dropped it a few times by accident and no damage to it or my tub. Just the right size too.</li>
    <li> I use this to shave with every day.  We am remodeling our house and all I have available is an outside shower.  I just hung this on the wall.  Don&#x27;t have any issues with it fogging but it works great.  My wife had me mount an extra hook so she can use it too.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;  Smaller than I expected but large enough</li>
    <li> Mirror fogs over when I first get in the shower but I remove it from the hook and run it under the shower and I can use it for the rest of the shower fog free.</li>
    <li> This is my third shower mirror design and by far my most favorite.</li>
    <li> Good price and quality.  Installs effortlessly and works quite well.  No issues..</li>
    <li> This product has 2 advantages over all the other shower mirrors I have had over the years.  One is that because you can easily run hot shower water over it, you can shave without the fog and the second is that the strips actually hold to the shower wall and do not constantly fall on the shower floor.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he said it was good just that the mirror was pretty small but other that that it was good</li>
    <li> Works fine, heat it in shower stream and shave, basic, cheap, easy install</li>
    <li> I have tried all the different styles of fog less mirrors and have yet to find a good one. You need to run shower water on it for 20 seconds to get it to stay reasonably clear.</li>
    <li> Foggs quicker than a regular mirror, I expected it to fog just not that quick, comes with command hooks that hold great so if you are ok with washing it with tooth paste so it will stay fog free while you shave then its for you.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s how long it took to fog right up.  Not really much else to say&lt;br /&gt;Premium Fog Full Shower Mirror</li>
    <li> Ultra lightweight does the job. Hook was sticking then i had the shelf height wring other command strip fell. Probably my error so now it goes on a shelf in shower</li>
    <li> very nice.  light and shiny.  the hook works well and you take the mirror off and run it under the warm water to heat it up to be fog free.  it comes with an extra command strip so if you want to move it at some point you have an extra strip.</li>
    <li> sILVER COMMING OFF THE BACK, NOT WORTH THE MONEY, WARRANTY?</li>
    <li> Works well in the shower.</li>
    <li> Reflective backing is peeling after 1 month of use.  On to the seller to see if there is a warranty process on this.</li>
    <li> Got this for my brother. There is a protective grey film over the mirror that neither one of us could get off. It needs a pull-tab of some type in order to remove this film.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mirror! It works perfectly. Make sure to follow the directions and you will have a no-fog shave right in the shower. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Anti fog works but water really stuck to this thing. Going to try a few automotive products. The water drops are just as bad as the fog. Very light weight and clear. I would buy it again if I can reduce the water sticking to it.</li>
    <li> This really works in the shower. I recommend holding it under the shower stream for a few moments to adjust the mirror temp.</li>
    <li> Simple, easy to install and works as advertised.  There is no need to over think this if you get a better shave in the shower.  This product works great, just hold it under the water for a few seconds.  If it steams up again for those long Saturday morning showers, put it under again.  I&#x27;ve used several other more expensive solutions over the years and this works better over the long run.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s been hanging in the shower for several months now (porcelain tile) and no problems at all.  once it warms up it remains fog-free.</li>
    <li> Works great and the hanger sticks for a long time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so simple and works great. Run it under the water for 20 seconds and you&#x27;re fog free.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product&lt;br /&gt;simple to use...no &amp;#34;tanks&amp;#34; just hold under hot water for a couple seconds and it works perfectly!  Love it!</li>
    <li> This mirror somehow makes me feel dizzy when I look at myself in the mirror. The backing is made of plastic so I wonder if there is some subtle distortion. Also, the square hole at the top is quite annoying to me. I ended up buying a proper round shaving mirror.</li>
    <li> Works great!  No complaints!</li>
    <li> Mirror is working well so far. Easy to hang, easy to activate anti-fogging by running under water. No complaints.&lt;br /&gt;I like this much better then a different brand I had for years that attached to the spout above the showerhead and had water circulating through it. This mirror has no place for minerals etc. to build up. Simple easy idea.</li>
    <li> Goood product. works as expected. It&#x27;s just a mirror.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent plastic mirror.  Just follow the directions and it&#x27;s pretty fog resistant.</li>
    <li> This has really helped my husband shave his head and face in the shower!  Great buy!  Absolutely recommended for everyone.</li>
    <li> is very easy to install, it has been very useful. mirror size makes it very useful. it was a good buy</li>
    <li> Does what is supposed to.</li>
    <li> Simply a must have. Just heat it up and away the whiskers go!</li>
    <li> Its much smaller than I realized. I wish they had a hydrophobic coating. the water stays on and leaves water spots when it dries</li>
    <li> This thing says PREMUIM FOG FREE.  YEAH RIGHT. Stupid mirror fogged up within 3 minutes in the shower. The size is fine for it but dont buy the &amp;#34;FOG FREE&amp;#34; gimmick.  Its literally worthless for shaving cause it fogs up so fast.  Maybe ill put some Rain-X on it or something....</li>
    <li> Miss leading mirror always fogs, cheap ashesive tap</li>
    <li> Everything about the mirror is fine; except for one feature. It is not fog free.  Yes, it you hold it under hot water for a few minutes, it does take longer to fog up.  However, it still fogs up. If you hold any mirror under hot water it will take longer for it  to fog up. It&#x27;s just a shower mirror. Easy to hang.</li>
    <li> Perfect mirror for trimming my beard in the shower stall... Don&#x27;t need it to be fog-free as I trim before I shower. But, the mirror is large and the image is super bright. Nearly perfect... Do not want to use the adhesive pads on the walls, so I also ordered a set of Inter-Design Power Lock suction cups. That makes the mirror absolutely what I&#x27;ve been wanting for a long time. Suggestion to manufacturer: include a suction cup in the package.</li>
    <li> The trick to this mirror is to run it under the shower water for a minute, it needs to be warm, I live in a very cold house,(expensive oil heat)  and as long as the mirror is warm, it will not fog. If it does fog, just run hot water over it again. I have used them all, and they only last a year, so this works as expected for the price. I would not over think these things, nothing is truly fog proof, I guess maybe NASA has something, but for my budget, this works fine. You will realize the point of the hook, is to be able to remove it from the hook, run it under hot water if it fogs, and then it stays clear again/</li>
    <li> Not the best fogless mirror -- it&#x27;s OK.</li>
    <li> mirror works great in the bathroom shower.  Doesn&#x27;t fog up.  item as describe. fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Sooooo small and cheap, this is one I wish I could do over.</li>
    <li> Decent for the price. I like that you can take it off the hook if you need to check a spot. It does need to be rewarmed mid shower.</li>
    <li> Attached easily and is easy to de-fog, just spray it with warm water from the shower head for 20 seconds or so.</li>
    <li> Works fine.  Still fogs a little, but acceptable.</li>
    <li> Mirror will fog up. Ran it in warm water still fogged up. Not what they claim. Would not recommend this mirror to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works great! You have to let the hot water run over it for 20-30 seconds and it should stay fog-free for 10 minutes. If it starts to get a little foggy, I just run it under the hot water again, and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
    <li> should have known it would fog up ,i think there is no such thing as fog free mirror for shower i followed directions to a T and still fogged up had to keep wiping it off but looks good</li>
    <li> It fogs still. It is perfect for me bc I don&#x27;t have Men&#x27;s hair all over my sink! Recommended.</li>
    <li> Perfect shower mirror.  I have tried a couple of others, notably a Sharper Image that had to be installed in between the pipe and shower head and a suction cup mirror with a circular light around it that didn&#x27;t really light much. Installation is super simple; image clarity is the best I&#x27;ve seen from any shower mirror, and I only need to hit it for a few seconds with the water stream to keep it clear while I shave. I hitit with the squeegee when I do the shower door glass and it stays perfectly clean. Highly recommended, especially at the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright.  I followed the directions, holding the mirror under the water for a minute, but it only stays unfogged for a couple of minutes...  It lasts long enough to shave, but it doesn&#x27;t stay clear like they say.</li>
    <li> A little on the small side but works great for my husband.</li>
    <li> Very nice mirror, especially like the company that followed up to make sure I was happy.</li>
    <li> Excellent mirror. Does fog up a little but since it isn&#x27;t attached to the wall (just hangs by a hook), you can easily run it under the water and fog be gone! My husband is thrilled to be able to shave in the shower....and I&#x27;m thankful no more mess on my sink and mirror!</li>
    <li> I wanted a simple shower mirror and this is it. I like it beacuse you can remove it easily and hold under the warm water for a few seconds then it will not fog until after I&#x27;m done shaving. I lift it off when I&#x27;m done to dry with my towel so no water spots and put it back in a flash. Easy to clean, easy to use,  reflects like a real mirror and never fogs, what more could you want.</li>
    <li> it is easily removable to be cleaned.  the hook works great.  any mirror in the bath is probably prone to fogging.  I just rinse and try to work with it.  I didn&#x27;t try heating it up first and I didn&#x27;t need it for long but I assume that would work.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised...compact, fog-free mirror with easy stick &#x27;em hook. Perfect for the curved wall in our camper.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Delivered on time. I would refer a friend.</li>
    <li> Light weight&lt;br /&gt;Perfect size&lt;br /&gt;but the my reflection is greatly distorted&lt;br /&gt;Face appears thin and elongated</li>
    <li> Well made and very easy to install!&lt;br /&gt;Great price!What else can I say this was less tan half the cost of the stores and better in my opinion!&lt;br /&gt;Works great and now I shave in the shower and love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;randyman</li>
    <li> This mirror is great.  I have to run it under the water a few times per my usual ten minute shower to de-fog the mirror, but otherwise it&#x27;s great.  I&#x27;ve cleaned it a few times in the last couple months with some Windex and it&#x27;s just fine.</li>
    <li> Love it. Work perfectly.</li>
    <li> NICE!! Enjoy your shaving!! I don&#x27;t still believe I wasted my money $13.97 on it~ I am still kicking my head and Ass..&amp;#34;IDIOT!! BASTARD!!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Just as described, and the first logical &amp;#34;fog-free&amp;#34; shower mirror I&#x27;ve ever found. You just have to spray it with some shower water (easy to do if you have a wand-type shower head) fog-free lasts even past time needed for a good shave, because it is so thin, and comes to right temp quickly. I&#x27;ve always had the ones with the fancy frame and promises, that NEVER work correctly. This one is simple, easy to install, great, distortion-free image.</li>
    <li> Ok but not as good as the oval one I purchased from Cassani</li>
    <li> Finally.  I can shave in the shower.  And the price is Right!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son. His old mirror wasn&#x27;t fog free anymore and kept falling off the wall.  Now he is using this and says it is fog free and he&#x27;s enjoying it.</li>
    <li> Simple to use and install. My husband likes it very much.</li>
    <li> Perfect size love the way it hangs without suction cups</li>
    <li> The sale price is more than the original price.  I guess I will pass this deal up.</li>
    <li> works just like ad says.</li>
