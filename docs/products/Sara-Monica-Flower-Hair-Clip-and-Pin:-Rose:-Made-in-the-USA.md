<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Wore it to my sister&#x27;s wedding and everyone loved it, it was beautifully made. I would recommend this to friends.</li>
    <li> So fast! Beautiful! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I received many compliments on this gorgeous red rose hair clip, it is very life like  and has such a striking red color.</li>
    <li> I purchased the red rose to wear to my work&#x27;s Christmas party. The rose itself is absolutely gorgeous, well made, and very well packaged. I received so many compliments on it and it really made me feel amazing. The rose was the perfect size for me and really complimented my slightly retro outfit. I would highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> First of all let me just say that I NEVER buy accessories.  I am very understated and do not like to be flashy, so I am really careful about ordering anything- BUT I saw this and went out on a limb... SO glad I did!!  This clip is absolutely incredible.  The fabric is beautiful, timeless, sturdy- looks great in pictures.  I cannot believe what a bargain this little gem was :)  It arrived in the mail very soon after I ordered it, and the customer service was so heartwarming and helpful!  I wore this is my hair for Valentines Day and my fiance went wild over it.  I literally got compliments on my hair ALL night.  I wish I could post a picture because I feel this review just does not do it justice.. If you are looking for a classy and beautiful accessory, this is for you.. it will be the best purchase ever!  I LOVE IT and thank you so much!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered Sara&#x27;s red rose to wear in my hair for my New Year&#x27;s Eve wedding.  I had been trying to decide on something for my hair and wasn&#x27;t excited about any of the usual bedazzled hair accessories for weddings, because my dress already had beading all over.  Because I planned to wear red shoes and carry a bouquet of red roses, it occurred to me that a red rose hair clip would be perfect.  I found this one almost right away and ordered it based on all the positive reviews.  I was very excited when it came as it was beautifully made and packaged.  It also happened to perfectly match my shoes.  I had my hair and makeup professionally done, and this rose was the perfect special touch for my wedding.  Thank you, Sara for doing such beautiful work!</li>
    <li> I got the red one  and it is so pretty i now have it in teal light blue and black! Good quality, arrived quickly and came in a lovely box. Would definitely recommend, and will be ordering more cilorsy</li>
    <li> Just received it!! It is gorgeous. Beautiful deep red color. The size is perfect. The quality of the craftsmanship is obvious (support made in the USA). I will be happily wearing this at my wedding!</li>
    <li> Yes yes and yes, this was perfect to put in my hair for prom, she sends you a hand written letter inside too, so precious, I will continue to buy these.</li>
    <li> I loved this beautiul hair clip and pin flower. It is beautifully made with quality satin. The seller is a wonderful person who included both a kind hand-written note and a lollipop in the package, as well as instructions for care. I love the product and would recommend it, and the fantastic seller, to anyone interested.</li>
    <li> wow - a lot of love, care, thought went into the design of this beautiful flower.  it is a work of art.  and it came unbelievably well packaged -  which shows how much the creator wanted it to arrive safely and in mint condition.  i would give 10 stars if i could.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these beautiful Red Rose Clips and they were so much more to see in person! Well crafted, high quality, and stunning. Instructions were included,too, in how to fix the flower in the future should a pedal ever be bent, etc - very helpful information. The packaging was spectacular for protecting these in shipping as well as nothing short of heartwarming. The Seller writes personal notes with the sweetest little drawings that would make anyone&#x27;s day brighten in an instant, with a little candy treat included, etc. I want to buy from her again just because of her very friendly and endearing approach to customer service and her gratitude for your patronage. Truly an excellent experience from the product to the Seller. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the best constucted flower I have ever received. It was so nice that it was taped to the box so it wouldn&#x27;t get smushed. It is 100% worth the money.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with these flower clips!  I ordered two of the peonies for my sisters to wear in their hair at my wedding, and a red rose for my hair for everyday wear because I wanted a clip too!  Not only did my order ship extremely fast, but it was packaged with such great care.  Sara had included detailed instructions with each clip on how to care for it/clean it and offered some helpful tips in case shipping messed up the flower petals any (it didn&#x27;t - but that was great to have!).  On the bottom of my invoice was a sweet hand-written note thanking me in detail for my order.  Okay folks - how often do people write hand-written notes anymore?!  Ones that refer to you by your name and not a customer ID number??  It just doesn&#x27;t happen in this impersonal world anymore.  There was also a package of Sweet Tarts down in the box which I cracked up as soon as I saw because I love those things and probably haven&#x27;t had them in 15 years or more!  Anyways, the clips themselves are absolutely gorgeous and just what I wanted, but it&#x27;s these extra touches in my opinion that really set this seller apart.</li>
    <li> Very pretty rose pin/hair clip.  My friends like to wear Sara&#x27;s flowers as same-color corsage pins on sweaters and tees.  My 12-year-old daughter and her friends love to wear Sara&#x27;s flowers as hair clips. Beautiful quality!</li>
    <li> The shipping was super fast and came with a sweet personalised note. My red rose I ordered to wear on my wedding day is beautiful. I&#x27;m thrilled!</li>
    <li> The pins looked so much better in person than the picture shown!  I was pleasantly surprised and I love my pins! I&#x27;m using my order to accent my bridesmaids&#x27; dress in my upcoming wedding!  It&#x27;s a perfect touch of flare so inexpensive!  Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> The rose arrived in record amount of time. It was just amazing. I wore it to a wedding and got so many compliments on it. Everyone thought it was real! Sara is so wonderful. She made sure I got this on time and took that extra step for me. Customer service is top notch! I ordered another one since I got so many compliments. I promise, you will not be disappointed with it. It is truly beautiful!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the rose it looks great in my hair! It is beautifully made. I will purchase from you again!</li>
    <li> i hated this rose clip it took like 50 days 2 arrive and then when it did arrvie it was over 7 feet long and it rapped around my head like 10000000 times....it is soooo ugly and i just got it today and it already broke it is sooo suckish..........if you are thinking about buying it                              DON&#x27;T!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I must say that these brooches/pins/hair clip accessories are truly exceptional. I have never before seen such artistry and quality in what I would traditionally call a hair clip. These accessories are a work of art, too much so to be lumped in with the simple \\&quot;drugstore hair clip category\\&quot;. You can clip it in your hair or wear it as a pin on a jacket etc.. The quality of the fabric is superb, truly a work of ART. I am more than pleased with my multiple purchases!</li>
    <li> looks beautiful, my girlfriend loved it :D</li>
    <li> Just beautiful. Very pleased</li>
    <li> Perfect exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I bought this item based on the fact that is hand made in the USA, although there is no way to fact check if it&#x27;s true. It is expensive solely based on that, since I&#x27;ve seen other fabric roses that looked similar or better than this one for less. It is important for me to buy Made in USA so I forked up the money. Not to mention that the seller is very assertive on letting you know this is an artisan made product, almost to the point that it is a bit too much. The flower is so delicate you will receive a lot of instruction on how to open the package and such, makes me think that it probably won&#x27;t last very long if it requires so much care. Hopefully it will withstand at least some use. The pin and clip look just like a regular one so not sure what the fuss is about, maybe the glue they use is not good and the clip will come off from the flower quickly? Will post any updates if the quality is no good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rose itself is quite lovely, it is stiff and has plenty of petals so that it will look nice on clothes or hair (it does). The color is a bright red that is intense but not cheesy looking. The size is perfect, not too big to look gaudy but not too small to not be noticed. I put it on my hair and it looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought three so far and love them. I always get compliments on them and compliment any outfit, the colors are vibrant and the roses are perfect.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful flower that is very well made. I purchased red and wore it in my hair for my wedding. The flower is big enough that it makes a statement in photos but not so much that it looks costume-like.</li>
    <li> Perfect for 4 th of July</li>
    <li> Love it.  I bought it to attach to a plain black dress I have. It looks beautiful.</li>
    <li> I needed a red flower for a sorority event, and I have been using this flower for more things for almost two years now. It&#x27;s a beautiful color and has lasted me! I like that it has the ability to pin onto clothing or use in your hair. I also got a smaller flower as a bonus with a hand-written note! Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and realistic.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for someone, but opened up the box to check it out before I gave it to her. It&#x27;s super-cute, sturdy looking, and comes with a personalized note (seriously who does that anymore?!).</li>
    <li> This flower is simply gorgeous!  The size was perfect and it stays securly in my hair.  I don&#x27;t think the photo can capture how pretty it is.</li>
    <li> This is a beautifully made flower. And I got a personal email from Sara Monica LLC with great instructions for how to wear it for the photo shoot I used it for. Seriously, they really love what they create and this is going to last me forever. I want a reason to buy one in every color.</li>
    <li> This is gorgeous.  Super happy... and its a nice size, I didnt want a huge one!</li>
    <li> The material is sensitive, but it looks great! The hair-pin is glued though so if it falls off you can hot glue it back or just use it as a pin.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing. I am turning 21 in a couple of days and will be going to a Casino to live up the evening and such. My dress is black and my shoes are red. A red rose for my hair was an absolute must and this did not disappoint. It arrived faster than expected and absolutely blew me away. The quality and color are unmatched. The color is a rich, blood red and flawless. I think the handwritten note and the lolly that was included really set it over the top. I feel like I got something worth 10 times my money and with a personal touch that I never thought I&#x27;d see. Thank you for the beautiful piece and for making my 21st birthday outfit perfect.</li>
    <li> The rose is very pretty and delicate. It is perfect for what I need it and more. I&#x27;m planning on using it on my wedding day. The hand written note and the candy was the loveliest sweetest thing I have ever received with a purchase. and the price was great too.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t bought it yet. It would be helpful if the size of the hair clip and pin flower were listed.</li>
    <li> So well made! I really love this item. I got this for a Halloween costume, but it will be going into my regular wardrobe. I need to order a couple more colors as well!</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with this!!!! It is great quality and I would definitely buy more colors.</li>
    <li> Reasons this product is my new favorite thing about life:&lt;br /&gt;1) I got it four days after I ordered it. Really quick! Which was good because I needed it to wear to a wedding.&lt;br /&gt;2) Its gorgeous and practical. You can dress it up or down. I wore ot to school with a tshirt and jeans and it looked great and I got tons of compliments at the wedding I wore it to. The petals are stiff enough not to droop but not so stiff they look too fake. I got it for my hair so I was scared the pin would press against my head while I used the clip but you cant even feel it.&lt;br /&gt;3) Sara Monica is so sweet! I got a coupon to her website, a note that was handwritten to me, directions for if the flower was messed up by shipping (which wasn&#x27;t the case), a packet of sweettart candies, and she drew flowers and hearts and vine designs all around my name on the receipt and on the note.&lt;br /&gt;4) My hair is sorta thin, so I was expecting it to pull out some hair like clips usually do for me. I was just gonna deal with it, but it didn&#x27;t pull out any!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it! I had literally no problems with it. I got the black because personally I think it looks the best of all of them, but get whatever suits you and the colors you wear! Some of my friends tried it on and it looked good on all hair colors, lengths, thicknesses, textures, and skin colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfection!</li>
    <li> I received the flowers from Amazon (red and blush colours) in mint condition with everything being properly wrapped. There are interactions on how to open the box and remove the tape to make sure the flowers are not damaged. Just from the way each flower is packed one can see how much care and thought was put into making them. The flowers are very very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sara Monica also sent me an email to make sure that the flowers received are in the best condition, new and wrapped, that the quality I get is what they expect. I really appreciate the skill of the artisans for making such beautiful products. I appreciate even more how they care about and take pride in each and every flower they make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will certainly buy more in the future to match with different dresses for my ballroom competitions. These are ideal for hair. The size is just nice, not too small, not too big. Your hair will look great with one or two flowers. If Sara Monica makes smaller sizes I would love them very much too. There are many colours to choose from; I had a very hard time picking which colour to get first; all of them are very pretty.  I am sure you will like them as much as I do.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift and the person I got it for had nothing but good things to say about it.</li>
    <li> i love the attitude and sass this flower projects!  i had an audition for a local production of the rocky horror show.  i strutted in wearing this flower in my hair and a red v-neck top and got a part as a transylvanian!  the whole thing rocked!  well, i&#x27;ve misplaced the original rose, and we can&#x27;t have that can we?  this is an excellently made beautiful rose which stays in your hair as long as it needs to.  can&#x27;t wait to receive it again!</li>
    <li> If i could give this Red Rose Clip more stars I would!, This clip stays in place for hours!, incredible clip and GORGEOUS!!! I am going to order again and again very soon!!! You WILL LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> This was a great hair piece to wear with Sexy Designer Strap Color Block Pleated Empire Evening Cocktail Party Mini Dress, Small, Red &amp; Black. This flower looks really nice and it is not cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Simply amazing. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this timeless wardrobe staple.</li>
    <li> I was going for the pin up girl look. This flower is beautiful. It is lovingly made...and the quality is EXCELLENT. It came with a sweet note and some candy. What a great seller.</li>
    <li> i am very satisfied with this product. the hairclip is gorgeous! i cant find one thing wrong with it. it fits perfectly in my hair and its now definately a must before i leave the house. also, sara monica is a total sweetheart! she took the time to write a little message inside the package saying she appreciates the purchase and told me to stay warm in my hometown! so sweet, came with a cute heart lollipop and a 10% off coupon for my next purchase! you will NOT be disappointed!</li>
    <li> It is huuuge! Too big for me.</li>
    <li> Everytime i wear one of these flowers i get tons of compliments! The only thing i hate is that if i pin it to the side of my head theres a gap where you can see the metal part. But then again this usually happens with all bows, flowers etc. i wear. Just need to tease your hair a tiny bit and its perfect!!!</li>
    <li> Love this get so many compliments every time I where it. I want to get it in several different colors. Completes my Pin Up look &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> This is a very cute hair clip and it looks just like the picture, exact color. Its a great quality and I know it will last me through the ages. It shipped in great time and the company even sent me candy with a hand written letter thanking me for my purchase. I thought that was nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very impressed. The flower came within just a few days, carefully packaged with tissue paper. Included were instructions on care for the flower, a handwritten note (with, I must say, very artistic doodles), and candy. The flower itself looks gorgeous and well-made, and the little extras really charmed me. Excellent product, excellent customer service. I will definitely buy from Sara Monica again--her other products are beautiful too.</li>
    <li> Love my red rose!! the size is perfect, not too small or too big! and it looks real!</li>
    <li> beautifully made!  The manufacturer emailed me personally to be sure it arrived ok and looked good.  I was really impressed with their dedication to quality.  I highly recommend this product.  I will definitely order more in the future.</li>
    <li> Absolutely gorgeous. The picture doesn&#x27;t even do it justice! Whoever made this really put time and effort into making it beautiful!</li>
    <li> Beautiful. I was shocked when I opened the container at how much obvious care went into making this. It&#x27;s an amazing quality for the price and looks gorgeous next to my hair bun when it&#x27;s up. I bought it to go with a Halloween sugar skull costume and can&#x27;t wait to wear it out :)</li>
    <li> What a lovely flower! I&#x27;m so delighted with the color and quality. This is the perfect accessory for my rockabilly themed outfit.</li>
    <li> Another stunning Sara Monica product. I wonder who she is that she produces such a simple, yet elegant product, good enough to use at a wedding? This rose accompanied a red evening dress used as a second wedding dress to make the rest of the wedding much more comfortable for the bride.</li>
    <li> Very pretty and life-like.  Great care was taken in the hand making and shipping of this product.</li>
    <li> The rose pin came very quickly and the inside package was very cute with good directions for removing the rose.  Loved the inclosed note and the follow-up e-mail.  The rose is beautiful and well made.  I would not hesitate about ordering from this website again.</li>
    <li> Good quality and beautifully crafted flower. The red is more of a tomato red, kind of orange red. The size is perfect, not to big or small. Very pretty and well made</li>
    <li> Loved it wore for my mom&#x27;s wedding and they wrote a small note and sent a candy with it so nice I kept that small note the rose is perfect looks real !!</li>
    <li> This flower is awesome!! It&#x27;s nice and sturdy, and the petals are stiff, so it won&#x27;t move around in the wind. It has a clip on the back for hair, as well as a pin so it can be used for clothing as well. It came in a lovely little white box with instructions how to open (flower pinned to the bottom to prevent damage during shipping). The flower also came with instructions on how to care for it, and a little packet of Smarties! I love the flower so much, and can&#x27;t wait to wear it. I&#x27;ll update my review when I wear it, and include a photo or two. 10/10, will order again!! :)</li>
    <li> Beautiful,well made, Perfect size.</li>
    <li> Very beautifully made and the seller included a hand written note thanking me for the purchase and gave care instructions.</li>
    <li> I love this flower, it looked great in my hair for a wedding I went to. Very well made &amp; survived a 10 hr flight in a suitcase. Love it!</li>
    <li> Perfect.. I plan on buying more in other colors!</li>
    <li> I love this flower. It looks so elegant and the fabric is top notch. I recommend it to all who want to make a statement on an outfit or just their hair. 5 STARS Oh and the customer service is incredible!</li>
    <li> The flower hair ornaments you get from this company are the best I&#x27;ve seen. They are well worth the money. They come carefully packaged and are gorgeous. I also received a personalized note in the box and some treats as a thank you. You get the impression that this is a small business that really wants to impress you with their quality and service, and I like supporting businesses like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These ornaments are nice and big and very noticeable. I got the green dahlia and the red rose. They&#x27;re easy to clip in your hair or pin on anything.</li>
    <li> A wonderful experience all around. The flowers are beautiful, made with devotion, shipped with care and speed, accompanied by a lovingly hand-crafted gift card. Besides that, the correspondence with Sara Monica may not be required for everybody, but for me it was a delight having contacted her. I was treated very friendly, with much effort to accomodate my requests. She went out of her way to make me feel very special and happy. Last but not least, my little girl loves the flower ornaments and looks just beautiful with them in her hair. I thank you, Sara, for this wonderful experience.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely, high quality hair clip that I would recommend to anyone. It is as beautiful as the picture and the seller is excellent.</li>
    <li> I loved this flower! The only reason I gave it four start is because it was a little too stiff of fabric for me but it was still amazing.. Amazing shape, amazing color, and it held very tight in the hair. It was just the perfect size too and it came with a little note and a candy inside! How sweet! I would recommend this product for sure!</li>
    <li> Very nice - sturdy material, color as pictured, and very careful and cute packaging with a nice handwritten note. Well done!</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and in perfect condition - beautifully packaged with a personal note and a piece of candy!! I used the rose hair clip in a performance of the opera CARMEN! The clip on the rose is very sturdy and well-made and never fell off until I took it off. The color of the rose is a beautiful red. I highly recommend this product and seller. I&#x27;d like to see more of her products!! 10 stars!!</li>
