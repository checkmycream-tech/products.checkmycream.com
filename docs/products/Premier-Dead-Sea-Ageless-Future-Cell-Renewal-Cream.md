      <li>yet, but I do love the way my face feels after I use it.  </li>
      <li>What not to love about the products.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love this brand and this stuff makes my face feel</li>
      <li>I love Premier products.</li>
      <li>Also most cosmetic research agencies indicate that UREA can cause inflammation.</li>
      <li>and I just love it.  </li>
      <li>I get more compliments about how I never look my age - I am 62 and most people think I am in my 40&#x27;2.  </li>
      <li>It is light, velvety and amazing.</li>
      <li>Yes, I know most cosmetics use the synthetic form of UREA.</li>
      <li>I like the Ageless Future line better, and the cream is great!  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this cream.</li>
      <li>Love this product and love this brand.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I have discovered this product.</li>
      <li>Great price for this product,  Makes my skin feel great,  this product typically costs much more.</li>
      <li>Quick delievery!</li>
      <li>This cream is light and soaks into my skin leaving it well hydrated.  </li>
      <li>product was nice to use but really did not see any results or improvements&lt;</li>
      <li>I won over $1000 of Premier products years ago, they are great and this cream is no different.</li>
      <li>It feels smooth to the touch and looks softer - for that reason alone, I give it 5 stars.</li>
      <li>Very effective, even magical; it is a product from the Dead Sea; this is a very special place chosen by the Lord for His people - the Jews</li>
      <li>Excited to try out the product.</li>
      <li>Does not match the original product I bout in smell or anything</li>
      <li>Originally tried it from a Kiosk at the mall, but found if ever so affordable at Amazon.  </li>
      <li>My skin looks better, no dryness any more, no allergy reaction or break out so far.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for the past year and while results are good, I find the skin on my forehead showing more fine lines.</li>
      <li>And arrives quickly.</li>
      <li>It keeps my skin fresh and moistured and wrinkles are not as visible as before.</li>
      <li>and I can honestly say that it performs the same as some creams that cost upward of $250 dollars.</li>
      <li>It is easily absorbed into skin and does not leave skin feeling oily.  </li>
      <li>I have found all premier products to be well worth it</li>
      <li>I received this cream few days ago and this is one of the best creams I ever used (and I used only brand name products).</li>
      <li>I really can recommend it, 5 stars!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
      <li>I started using about 9 months ago and am being told what pretty skin I have.  </li>
      <li>My husband also noticed the positive difference in my skin immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I really like this one.  </li>
      <li>thats really embarrassing</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I just love everything from Premier Dead Sea products.  </li>
      <li>to go through with my normal regimen</li>
      <li>but it makes me feel my skin smooth, soft and moisture, even in the dry Pennsylvania.</li>
      <li>Do not buy this product at the mall because as other reviewers have mentioned it has a huge markup</li>
      <li>so far I will write a proper review once i see a real result on my skin.</li>
      <li>I have been using this cream for at least 8 years or more</li>
      <li>I applied to my face and immediately developed a burning sensation.  </li>
      <li>So if you are sensitive you may want to try this at the mall without buying to find out if you will be sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My skin feels so soft after applying it</li>
      <li>Ladies with mature skin, try them.  </li>
      <li>I think the it has natural smell and</li>
      <li>I am fifty and still look like I am in my early forties.</li>
      <li>You only need a little because it spreads and covers very well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have just started using this product so suffice it to say, it&#x27;s not a miracle cream and I don&#x27;t see &amp;#34;results&amp;#34; yet, but I do love the way my face feels after I use it.  It feels smooth to the touch and looks softer - for that reason alone, I give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Originally tried it from a Kiosk at the mall, but found if ever so affordable at Amazon.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This cream is light and soaks into my skin leaving it well hydrated.  I love Premier products. I use them all the time.</li>
    <li> Very good product!  Seems to be the same quality as what I bought at  a show from a rep recently</li>
    <li> I have used a few other Premium products but I really like this one.  My skin feels so soft after applying it and I do feel that my skin has improved some.</li>
    <li> I have tried to Biox line and the Ageless Future line.  I like the Ageless Future line better, and the cream is great!  It is easily absorbed into skin and does not leave skin feeling oily.  I definately recommend!</li>
    <li> Love the cream!  I am fifty and still look like I am in my early forties.</li>
    <li> Love this product and love this brand.  I started using about 9 months ago and am being told what pretty skin I have.  It is this brand.  Best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> its make my skin dry !!!</li>
    <li> rvcd and arrived on time a very nice lotion leaves my skin soft and looking good I have found all premier products to be well worth it</li>
    <li> This product does not work at all.  I see zero benefits to my skin.  I would not recommend this product.  Save your money and buy from wal-mart or something.  I just am not impressed at all with this product.</li>
    <li> I love this brand and this stuff makes my face feel&lt;br /&gt;Better and softer. I recommend to any skin type a I am Asian with oily skin</li>
    <li> I applied to my face and immediately developed a burning sensation.  Felt like a chemical peel.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for at least 8 years or more and I just love it.  I get more compliments about how I never look my age - I am 62 and most people think I am in my 40&#x27;2.  I also teach school so I am home all summer and I am at the beach and in the sun 24/7.  I am also in the sun during my vacations.  I use this cream before I put on my make-up and before I go to bed.  You only need a little because it spreads and covers very well. Great Product - all Premier products are great and I swear by them and Amazon has great prices and ships right away!!!!</li>
    <li> I am using this product for almost 6 months. It keeps my skin fresh and moistured and wrinkles are not as visible as before. I&#x27;m glad I have discovered this product.</li>
    <li> Great price for this product,  Makes my skin feel great,  this product typically costs much more. Works as good as product I have paid 250.00 for</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product at the mall because as other reviewers have mentioned it has a huge markup there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I have been using this product for around four weeks and I can honestly say that it performs the same as some creams that cost upward of $250 dollars. There is a small thing you have to remember when using this cream and that is that you have to keep using it to retain the results! I have been guilty of discontinuing use for a day or two because I was &amp;#34;just too tired&amp;#34; to go through with my normal regimen and I noticed the difference immediately. While using the Ageless future cream I noticed an immediate softening and fullness in the one present small lines I have on my 34 yr old face. My husband also noticed the positive difference in my skin immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that keeps me from writing a five star review is the fact that this product contains UREA! Yes, I know most cosmetics use the synthetic form of UREA. However that knowledge doesn&#x27;t keep me from being a little queasy that I&#x27;m putting the synthetic properties of urine on my face. Also most cosmetic research agencies indicate that UREA can cause inflammation. So if you are sensitive you may want to try this at the mall without buying to find out if you will be sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like it and it makes my skin feel great!</li>
    <li> I totally loved this cream. This is the best cream ever.  This cream makes my face look amazing.  I recommend it for all</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the past year and while results are good, I find the skin on my forehead showing more fine lines. Haven&#x27;t found another product that works as well</li>
    <li> This one fits any age and any type of skin. I am only 19 yrs but it makes me feel my skin smooth, soft and moisture, even in the dry Pennsylvania. The reason I did not give five star is I do not really like the smell. I think the it has natural smell and no more any additional fragrance added. But somehow I prefer the flower secent.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love Premier product!</li>
    <li> I just love everything from Premier Dead Sea products.  I have side by side the ones I purchased from the mall and the ones I purchased from Amazon.  They are identical.  One difference is the ones from Amazon at 70-90% discount from the mall.  What not to love about the products.  Ladies with mature skin, try them.  Cream works well with serum.  Your skin will thank you.</li>
    <li> I have been using these products a year and notice an improvement in my skin.  I highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I received this cream few days ago and this is one of the best creams I ever used (and I used only brand name products). Great texture and smell, very rich but not over for the day. My skin looks better, no dryness any more, no allergy reaction or break out so far. I really can recommend it, 5 stars!</li>
    <li> product was nice to use but really did not see any results or improvements&lt;br /&gt;will not be buy this again</li>
    <li> Quick delievery! Nice packaging. Not sure about the product itself yet, but it is a fraction of the price from local sellers. Excited to try out the product.</li>
    <li> This product works well for me. I use it under my daily moisturizer and it truly seems to re-new my skin during the day. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Actually.. we are just using it for 3 days and no skin irritation occurs so its good so far I will write a proper review once i see a real result on my skin.</li>
    <li> I gave one star to this product because I received just half of it, it means there was half fluid.... thats really embarrassing</li>
    <li> Not real. Does not match the original product I bout in smell or anything</li>
    <li> Very effective, even magical; it is a product from the Dead Sea; this is a very special place chosen by the Lord for His people - the Jews</li>
    <li> Always s great product. And arrives quickly. Thx</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cream. I won over $1000 of Premier products years ago, they are great and this cream is no different. It is light, velvety and amazing. Highly recommended.</li>
