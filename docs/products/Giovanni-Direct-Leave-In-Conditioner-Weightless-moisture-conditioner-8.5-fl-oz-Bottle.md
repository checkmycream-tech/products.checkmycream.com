<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> A friend gave me a bottle of Giovani Direct Leave-in Conditioner to try, and I was very very excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I try not to use anything without knowing exactly what the ingredients are and all I can say is as I read the label everything looked great, lots of natural, nutritive ingredients that benefit the health and appearance of the hair, almost perfect, -- almost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I nearly reached the end of the list of ingredients and saw Sodiumhydroxymethylglycinate (sp/),&lt;br /&gt;a real mouthful isn&#x27;t it..? And while I know that I&#x27;ve heard something about it in the past, but it was a few years ago and I can&#x27;t remember exactly what it was, so I decide to look it up, and big time shocker of the year, it has to do with formaldehyde (a dangerous paraben) ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other ingredients are great, I just don&#x27;t understand why any company that prides itself on being environmentally grounded would actually have an ingredient that is described in literature as , &amp;#34;A Formaldehyde Releaser...&amp;#34;  This, in a leave-in conditioner no less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is exactly why it is so important to read labels in our hair, skin and health products, as they may contain ingredients that can have a carcinogenic effect on the person or/and environment. Really scary stuff. now, I may have to go back and revisit some of my older/other product reviews because of this concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is for this reason alone that I have to say no-way to Giovanni Direct Leave-In. And I am totally bummed about it. 99% of the ingredients listed are awesome and then it&#x27;s like they have embalming fluid as a softener at the end, --that&#x27;s like asking people to omit the cancer risk of smoking because the tobacco is organic, and who wants that, craziness, or maybe they don&#x27;t care about their target consumer as much as they claim... I, however, do and would not use this on a child or a friend or anyone else for fear of any complications related to potential formaldehyde issues... It&#x27;s too great of a risk and a real slap in the face to the millions of loyal consumers ((sigh)).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- **Updated to add that some have said that there are different versions of the conditioner available without this ingredient, but, instead contains Phenoxyethenol and while it is not a paraben-based preservative, Phenoxyethanol is an aromatic ether alcohol. What does this mean? This ingredient starts out as phenol, a TOXIC white crystalline powder that&#x27;s created from benzene (a known carcinogen) and then is treated with ethylene oxide (also a known carcinogen) and an alkalai. And according to EWG.org, it has a risk score of 4... So, it still has carcinogenic concerns that need to be addressed --definitely a no-no for any natural product or anything that might be used on young children and teenagers and as such, it&#x27;s still not worth the risk for my own purposes either... So now I just make my own leave-ins, etc... And store them in the fridge as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, About Certified Organic Products: It&#x27;s so very important to remember that &#x27;Certified-Organic&#x27; products do NOT have to be 100% natural, it only means that they meet the minimum requirement in that a certain AMOUNT/percentage of their total ingredients are natural-- in no way does it imply that all of the ingredients are natural...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is why It&#x27;s important to KNOW what&#x27;s in your products and what impact these low-risk-to-moderate-risk ingredients can have on your health and even the environment. Anything you use on the hair can and will to some extent be absorbed into the body through the skin of the scalp...&lt;br /&gt;To make your own shampoos and conditioners you can use natural soaps like: Natural Cosmetics Raw Handmade African black Soap and Kirk&#x27;s Coco Castill Soap-Unscented and Natural Way Castile Liquid Soap-Unscented any of which can make awesome shampoos-- and for conditioners: Whole Leaf Aloe Vera Gel (Food Grade) and Raw Organic Shea butter and Castor Oil makes awesome base ingredients for homemade conditioners...&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;But, if you&#x27;re unsure about any ingredient look it up at the SkinDeep cosmetics safety information database available at EWG.org. It&#x27;s up to you to decide what is or isn&#x27;t worth the risk of usage, especially when pregnant or if caring for young children and teens, so I truly hope this helps.&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;For some reason the system won&#x27;t let you enter a review unless you select a star, but there are no-stars, here...&lt;br /&gt;Our Grade: F for safety concerns; or Zero Stars!dients for homemade conditioners...&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;But, if you&#x27;re unsure about any ingredient look it up at the SkinDeep cosmetics safety information database available at EWG.org.

    <li> Im never disappointed when it comes to this brand of hair care products. Always leaves my hair soft , manageable and full of volume. I will never stop using Giovanni</li>
    <li> I use this everyday and cannot get enough of it!</li>
    <li> I HATED this product when I first used it. But, once I discovered the right amount to use for my particular hair and when the best time to apply it was, I got the results I was looking for. I have super fine/thin wavy blonde hair that frizzes easily in humid weather and has thin ends. First, I discovered I need to shake the bottle pretty well before I use it. I use a TINY amount (this stuff is very thick like lotion) for my type of hair and really emulsify it in my hands before applying on towel dried hair right out of the shower (I find for my hair type, it&#x27;s best to put products in hair that&#x27;s still pretty wet as opposed to waiting until it&#x27;s had some time to dry). I put this on the last few inches of my hair and comb thru. It helps detangle and thicken the ends so that they don&#x27;t look so thin and have some good texture that&#x27;s not stiff. You can get this at Target and many online health stores for a good price as well as here on Amazon. I recommend it if you have hair like mine. Just have to find out what amount and technique works best for your hair.</li>
    <li> I have natural kinky hair and I can not believe I haven&#x27;t picked this product up before now.  I use it with water in a spray bottle for all my kids as a daily moisturizer with Cantu Shea butter.  I am now a loyal customer.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like shiny hair but I do like the look of hydration.  This product does the trick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been seaching for products to maintain my natural hair.  A friend suggested this line of products and upon my first use, I was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will have to evaluate the cost effectiveness; as I have long, thick hair and product usually depletes quickly.  But am pleased so far.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel light weight at all. It takes longer for the hair to dry with this stuff so it seems like my hair is getting damaged from the blow dryer. Also, my color faded twice as fast when I used this. I using it after couple weeks.</li>
    <li> I used to dread combing my hair after a wash - not anymore.&lt;br /&gt;This product has great slip and leaves my hair feeling really soft. The first time I used it, I kept running my hands through my hair. I just couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and manageable it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also slapped on way too much conditioner the first time I used it, that was wasteful. You don&#x27;t need as much and that equals value for money.</li>
    <li> I use it on my daughters hair, who is 3 and is super tender headed. It does help detangle knots and has a pleasant scent. Although, she still runs away from me when I bust out the comb, the product helps ease our frustration.</li>
    <li> Nice conditioner that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and scent does not bother me as it&#x27;s light.</li>
    <li> 4B or 4C hair, smooths great, also enhances your natural curl definition. Love it.  Purchased one bottle. After using a couple of times, purchased 2 more to have on hand. Saw it recommended on YouTube in a natural hair video on tips for natural hair</li>
    <li> I have used this brand of product before and am still satisfied with the quality and effectiveness that it has.</li>
    <li> I am black with 3c type hair.&lt;br /&gt;this leave in is not for me, leaves a stinky/dry feeling in my hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it also has alcohol as a main ingredient</li>
    <li> UPDATE (10/2014):&lt;br /&gt;THE 4B HAIR IS STILL BOUNCY &amp; SOFT! I have not changed my leave-in conditioner in 3 years because this one still does the job incredibly well. I&#x27;ve added Giovanni&#x27;s Smooth As Silk Deep Moisture Conditioner to the regimen and made other adjustments to increase effectiveness:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Slather hair with extra-virgin coconut oil (cold expeller-pressed) and let it soak in while you handle other business (i.e. a quick &amp; dirty pre-poo)&lt;br /&gt;- Wash scalp with Shea Naturals Thickening Shampoo (or whatever brand/formulation applies to you) or not (meaning, go straight to deep conditioning). Rinse with cool water, but at the end switch to warm/very warm water.&lt;br /&gt;- Use Giovanni&#x27;s Deep Conditioner. Let soak in under plastic cap under a low-heat dryer (or not) for half hour to an hour.&lt;br /&gt;- Rinse out completely with cool water, make that quick switch to warm/very warm water, don&#x27;t shake or wring dry and add the Giovanni Leave-In Conditioner. Let the water and product absorb into hair for 15-20 minutes or longer.&lt;br /&gt;- Slather hair again with extra-virgin coconut oil, paying special attention to ends. This step seals in the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;- Then, use whatever holding/styling products (in my case, large section-by-section Jane Carter Wrap &amp; Roll Foam or Giovanni Air Turbo Mousse and Andalou Naturals Medium Hold Sunflower Gel). I still use Kiss My Face Upper Management Gel [Medium hold] sometimes, particularly for slickbacks. Don&#x27;t forget to trim those ends with BARBER scissors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I usually do some type of wet set, not a wash n&#x27; go. I think the procedure still applies though to a wash n&#x27; go.&lt;br /&gt;_____________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;(Same review for the 3-bottle package of these... I really meant to post the review here.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium-long 4B hair (fine, z curly). I was looking for a leave-in that would detangle, but with mostly natural ingredients. Thanks to a previous, similar reviewer, I purchased this leave-in at a SuperTarget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: It did what other conditioning products did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I smooth on 2 quarter size (or less) dollops of this in my freshly washed (and sometimes conditioned) hair. I wait 10 minutes. Then, I can put a sturdy wide tooth comb through my hair with minimal resistance. The hair loss is dramatically less. I can do a wet set of my hair more quickly (in combo with a Kiss My Face Upper Management Gel [Medium hold] and Jane Carter Wrap &amp; Roll Foam over it). Also, my hair looks and feels incredibly soft as well as healthy when the style is dried. There&#x27;s no residue, and most importantly, my curls aren&#x27;t weighed down. It&#x27;s bouncy time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year. I don&#x27;t anticipate switching to anything else anytime soon.</li>
    <li> this product leaves my hair relatively soft and i believe i have 4c natural hair. the smell is kind of different but it is not your usual sweet smelling product. i live the smell though once it gets in your hair.</li>
    <li> My daughters and I are transiting from a perm to natural and this product leaves our hair soft, easy to comb, moisturized and beautiful.</li>
    <li> Great for natural hair. Can use to straighten or wear curly. Just overall great product. Would recommend to anyone, even for relaxed hair that is dry.</li>
    <li> I found this to be just okay, and I&#x27;ve used it on three different people with diverse hair textures.</li>
    <li> Great leave-in conditioner! The best.</li>
    <li> Love this. It&#x27;s not greasy</li>
    <li> I just recently big chopped and during my 1 year transition, I needed a product that would aid in detangling my natural hair and permed ends. This conditioner did just that! After countless YouTube videos, I noticed that many naturals were referring to this conditioner. It did exactly as they said it would. My hair is left super soft and my curls really pop.</li>
    <li> I have read so many different reviews about how awesome this leave-in is but I was not that impressed. I mean sure it&#x27;s nice but my hair just didn&#x27;t absorb it as much as I expected! It is a good product but I guess you have to know what YOUR hair type needs!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this leave in for my dry hair because it adds tons of moisture throughout the day. Not to mention one bottle lasts me nearly a month! I would definitely recommend this purchase. I like either put it directly on my damp hair or put some in my spray bottle mixed with water and aloe Vera gel.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product for natural hair! It is definitely one of my favorite leave I conditioners!</li>
    <li> Feels like lotion in your hair at first butbonve your hair dries, its smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> My favorite leave in conditioner!</li>
    <li> I like Paul Mitchel the Condition better but that is 20.00 compared to 6.00 so I cant complain too much.</li>
    <li> makes hair really soft and easy to detangle</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  Not quite as reviews seemed to say it was so good.  I plan to go back to my Kinky Curly Knot Today.</li>
    <li> Received my order on its expected date. I have amazing things about it. Will update once I use this product.</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; seller</li>
    <li> I gave it 3 because it was just okay. No WOW factor for me with this product. It&#x27;s just a good conditioner, i feel like it did anything extra to my hair. BTW, I have natural hair. I will use it but probably won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> just like several ladies in my book club suggested this leave-in works great. it leaves my hair feels soft not all dried out after cowashing and air drying.</li>
    <li> This is now my go to leave in conditioner</li>
    <li> Love ❤ it,  and will definitely order here again!</li>
    <li> nice daily leave in conditioner on my daughters natural hair. a little goes a long way so start out small and add more if needed.</li>
    <li> I think it might work.. Just tried this conditioner last night.  My hair looks great this morning. I have tried so many product on my hair! My hair is dry and a little frizzy, and nothing would tame it.  So far, I am pleased with this product.  Best of all, I like the fact that Giovanni products are cruelty-free!!!  That is a HUGE selling point for me.</li>
    <li> My hair gets super dry and this is the only thing that seems to keep it moisturized. Although this supposedly sold at Target and Walgreens where I live I have only just recently found it at a Super Target  a long distance away and it was out of stock. So happy to find a place to purchase it that I purchased three. Products were as described and came quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell (which is not too, too bad), however, I have natural, shoulder length African American hair which is probably about a 4B and it works wonders for detangling my hair after shampooing!</li>
    <li> I love the product itself, but I think the size selection is not reasonable. The packaging makes it look much bigger than it is, but in reality, an 8.5 oz container is smaller than a 12 oz can of soda (think about it). It&#x27;s time to make it available in larger sizes to the public. Like I said, I like the product, but not enough to buy this amount/price for use on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> This Leave-in is the one I go to ALWAYS.  It&#x27;s great for twist-outs and braid-outs.  LOVE GIOVANNI DIRECT LEAVE-IN CONDITIONER!!</li>
    <li> Lightweight, non greasy and makes my curls POP!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light and gives the right amount of weight to my hair. It is a great leave in conditioner for my natural hair.</li>
    <li> Love all Giovanni products !</li>
    <li> Great product. I give this conditioner two thumbs up. It&#x27;s very lite for everyday use. Try it I&#x27;m sure you will love it.</li>
    <li> Purchased Giovanni based on the success, heard from others. It&#x27;s exactly as described and more. Non-greasy and very light. A little goes a long way. However, I have super thick hair, so more is needed. Purchased two bottles, first go around, and will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> Leave in conditioners tend to feel heavy on me and if I go a couple of days without a wash it feels like it gets crusty. This product is less than other but still not super awesome. To me it doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance at all which is better than a strong fragrance but I don&#x27;t mind a inconspicuous scent. :)</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s non greasy, very subtle, keeps your hair looking great and has some organic products. What more could you want</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my daughter&#x27;s hair. She has dry, curly hair, and this leave-in makes it super soft and easy to manage. The smell is very light but clean. It&#x27;s definitely in my top 3 favorite leave-in conditioners.</li>
    <li> Very thick, &amp; creamy.. A little will goes along way, so don&#x27;t use too much.. Enjoy your Giovanni leave-in ladies..</li>
    <li> made my hair feel dirty</li>
    <li> Just flipping great! I love this product because it actually works for me. I have brown natural hair and i haven&#x27;t had a perm in 2 years. This journey has been a long one but its finally almost over!! I have learned that not using the same company for every part of my hair regimen works!</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizing leave in conditioner and I like the fact that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
    <li> Love it  very light weight</li>
    <li> This conditional smells nice and blended well with my shea butter mixture. Will be buying more. I just think it is costly!</li>
    <li> Love it, I used it everyday!</li>
    <li> After washing, I put this on my hair along with coconut oil, twist it and let it dry.  It makes my hair very soft.  I have thick African American 3B/3C hair, so this does not weigh it down.  The product had so many good reviews so I had to try it, and I really like it after three uses.  I hope it works for you.</li>
    <li> I like this leave in because it literally is great to just put it in my hair after a wash and let it dry- when it dries, my hair is very soft and I have no problems detangling (this is the only time I comb my hair and I find it is easiest and I have less breakage). I do not use any other products beside shampoo and conditioner on my hair.</li>
    <li> When I applied the leave-in conditioner to my hair, I combined it with castor oil and coconut oil and my hair felt BEYOND moisturized and became instantly soft. I couldn&#x27;t believe how well this product instantly soften my course, kinky hair, and my hair was very dry and frizzy before applying this. This has become my go-to conditioner and I will use it after washes, and styling my hair such as twist-outs. I highly recommend this product to other 4b/4c girls who can&#x27;t find a stable product for our hair!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay... A little does go a long way, but it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair shiny not very soft and I&#x27;ve had to reapply several times in a week.</li>
    <li> Kinda heavy for 3b hair also I hate the smell of this product it also leaves behind residue</li>
    <li> Seems to work. it&#x27;s very foamy, like shampoo but it&#x27;s not sticky and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue so I&#x27;m content with it. My hair might not like it. I have wavy, biracial hair (African American &amp; Chinese) so it takes a lot for my hair to enjoy a product.</li>
    <li> leaves hair feeling noticeably softer after use. Use this on my toddlers hair as well. its great for them without harse chemical. we are african american with thick hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see the hype...too light for my needs and my hair drinks this stuff for breakfast leaving it looking dry quickly</li>
    <li> This is a good product as far as leave in conditioners go. It&#x27;s not oily or heavy so it makes a good starting point for adding other products on top. I have natural (african american) hair and sometimes use this as my leave in for my twist outs and rod curls so I do add a couple of other products on top with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;The one of two negatives I think is that it doesn&#x27;t come in a spray bottle. The flip top is aggravating to use generally but at least the product comes out with ease (it&#x27;s not overly thick). I tried to add it to a spray bottle and it&#x27;s too thick for the thin pump and adding a little bit of water didn&#x27;t work either as it just separated again after it was shook (which tells me it&#x27;s not completely water soluble so it doesn&#x27;t absorb completely into the hair shaft) The other negative is the sheer amount of chemicals in the product. (the culprit of the separation in water) While it works for it&#x27;s intended purpose, I wish it were more all natural.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t irritate me too much more than any new product I use does. The smell was pleasant also. I will keep a bottle around because I do like it but I will keep searching for a more all natural leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> This leave-in conditioner is great. It&#x27;s lightweight, doesn&#x27;t cause build up. It keeps my hair wonderfully moisturized for up to 48 hours. I use this leave-in with various natural oils to seal in the moisture. This leave-in has been a lifesaver. If used after you wash and condition your hair, this leave-in helps in the detangling process. It has made styling my hair a breeze.</li>
    <li> Heart leave-in conditioner.</li>
    <li> loved this stuff! I normally don&#x27;t even write reviews, but I had to for this item. I have 3c/4a natural hair and I moisturized my hair with this before I tied up my hair when going to bed. The next morning my hair felt so silky and moisturized. I will definetly be ordering more</li>
    <li> Works great in my hair, and I will definitely be ordering another one once my current bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and eliminates frizz, It provides some moisture, but I have found products that give much more at the same price. I really love this lines conditioner though..</li>
    <li> not as great as i expected</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for at least 2 years now.  I always keep this product around, this is a staple on my daughters hair.  Sometimes I switch up on my hair and use the kinky curly knot today.  However this is much cheaper, and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes your hair soft.&lt;br /&gt;Makes it easy to detangle.&lt;br /&gt;Can also be used to do roller sets.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t leave any build up once used correctly.</li>
    <li> I love this leave in conditioner.... it smells great and it helps with my frizz</li>
    <li> I have 4a/ 3c curl type. When i applied the product it was great at first, but later that day my hair felt crunchy and dry. This is the only other product I use that isn&#x27;t natural besides Creme of Natures Argon Oil sulfate free shampoo (which is AMAZING!) I will continue to use it, just not as a leave in conditioner. I recommend trying it! All hair is different hair! So what doesnt work for one might be perfect for another! Good Luck!</li>
    <li> Not sure if I got a fake, but this product was terrible for me.  Left my hair so sticky I could not use it at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 month now, I&#x27;m from Per&amp;uacute; and here there aren&#x27;t good products for wavy hair so searching the web I found very good reviews from this product... so I order it hoping it would do the same for my wavy frizzy hair... but it really didn&#x27;t help at all &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> Nothing special. It&#x27;s just OK, didn&#x27;t do anything noticeable for my hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 yrs now and its hard to find in stores but its the best leave conditioner for my hair.</li>
    <li> I brought this about a month ago and just repurchased another. Works great for my 4a hair! It has great slip and leaves my hair feeeling soft without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> This product smells a little strange, nothing I smelled before in a hair products it makes me think of toilet bowl cleaner smell not a loud scent but not a nice smell either.</li>
    <li> Great product bring out the softness in the hair. Thank you</li>
    <li> very good detangler, leaves my hair very manageable and my hair is thin and coarse.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I am 6 months natural and this stuff has been a staple since the beginning. It lasts a long time because you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
    <li> THOUGHT I WOULD GIVE IT A TRY.  SEEMS TO BE OK.  NO HEAVY, SMELLY PERFUMES ADDED.  DOESN&#x27;T DULL HAIR.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Keeps my hair so moisturized after a wash</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner so much!!!! Unlike the stupid tea tree version, this conditioner is ALL NATURAL and smells amazing. Will buy the triple pack next time. Love Love Love!</li>
    <li> The product works very well, especially for naturals like myself. It gives your hair all the moisture it needs. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone, especially those with really dry hair and breakage. Someone whose hair has been damaged by chemicals may find this useful. I heard about it on a YouTube channel and I have been using it ever since. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Good conditioner. Suggestion: use very small amount</li>
    <li> This product does not give the African American hair the type of slip that it needs from conditioning. I Do NOT recommend for African American hair!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright. It does exactly what it says it does. It&#x27;s not too thick, kind of weightless. The only bad thing is the smell of it. I thought I could deal but I can&#x27;t:(</li>
    <li> Best leave in conditioner by far for my 4a&amp;4b hair texture. Makes my hair shiney and makes my twist outs and wash and go look fabulous</li>
    <li> My hair loves this item. The conditions works so good with my hair. On top of that it works well with my wash and go.</li>
    <li> One of my staple products and of great favorite, just like old reliable.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great at keeping the hair moisturized. My only complaint would be that it&#x27;s a bit heavy. But, I think if I just cut it with some water I could make it work for me.</li>
    <li> I have African American natural hair and I&#x27;m not that impressed with this product. I expected more conditioning or moisture for my hair with this product. I&#x27;m not seeing it what the rave is about.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  I have curly hair and and mod-cg (I wash with non sulfate shampoo and straighten occasionally) so its hard to find products sometimes.  Started using this and could see a difference in my hair immediately!  Definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This leave-in conditioner is light.. Does not add weight, and adds body, sheen, and softness without over-processing with protein. Tried many.. But this one works!!!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend.  My hair tends to frizz in the humidity and I was hoping this product would help with that.  Unfortunately, no luck.  If anything, I found the product tended to weigh my hair down which is worse than the frizz. I am sure it works well for some people.</li>
    <li> It did absolutely nothing! I tried it as a leave in conditioner- adding it to a few drops of oil sometimes... If anything the oil helps tame some frizz.. This actually make my hair feel like the ends of a broomstick. And I tried everything- a little, a lot, with oil, with no oil- no results!</li>
    <li> I am natural. Very light and nice. I recommend for twist outs and braidouts. Works really well without weighing down hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but I think I might try something else.  I have natural hair and use this almost every day.  It&#x27;s not sticky and smells nice, but I don&#x27;t feel anything great happening to my hair when I use.  I&#x27;ll try another product to see if there is a difference.</li>
    <li> This was the first of these products I ever used, my niece gave some to me for my permed hair and I just loved it. Then I decided to use all of the products! Love them all!</li>
    <li> My hair didn&#x27;t respond the wayI thought it would. What works for others doesn&#x27;t necessairly work you.</li>
    <li> For someone who&#x27;s hair is natural, it leaves soft to the touch and not flaky.</li>
    <li> I am Black American with severe dry hair issues IF I do not condition all the time.  This is one of the few products that I am able to really leave-in and continue with my usual routine of maintaining my curly natural. I mix with a little oil (grape seed or sweet almond or macadamia nut) and apply every other night before rolling hair on satin wrapped foam rollers.  By the time I am approaching build up, it is time to do my weekly wash so it&#x27;s no big deal. I paid $8.25 and it is now selling for $7.80. Go figure.</li>
    <li> Great product. Every since i&#x27;ve been using it people have been telling me how soft my hair is. I would buy it again</li>
    <li> Very good leave in and a liitle bit goes a long way.  Has a lot of slip.  But too expensive on Amazon.  It is a dollar less at swanson health products and puritain pride.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m natural and was looking for a leave-in that is a true leave-in conditioner.  This is it.  So much slip and moisture is delivered that I begin to think my hair isn&#x27;t coarse and subject to shrinking.  It is definitely worth trying and buying.  I buy two at a time because I can&#x27;t find it near me and I don&#x27;t want to run out.  Nice smell, not overpowering.  If it works on my hair I know it has to work on everyone else.  Recently tried Hello Hydration conditioner.  That&#x27;s great too but it&#x27;s not a leave-in like this stuff.  Thus I rinse that out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this leave-in for a very long time but never got around to it since I had so many other products to use up first. Finally got through my stash and with a $25 amazon gift card, I finally tried it and it was definitely worth the wait! It leaves my hair very soft and makes my curls really pop, plus it smells good too; would highly recommend :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good detangler and it leaves my hair smelling nice and fresh.</li>
    <li> You can buy this same sized product at vitacost.com for $4.87. Why are you paing more for the same item?</li>
    <li> This is a great leave in conditioner. It leaves my hair soft &amp; manageable &amp; a little goes a long way..</li>
    <li> I am African American with about 4C hair, and my hair is not permed and this product is cool but not for me. My 15 month old has very soft hair and not 4C (not sure which though loose curls but not super duper loose; she is not mixed) and when I put this on her hair it moisturizes it and brings out all of her curls. I originally bought this product for her so if I wouldn&#x27;t have used it, it would have been five stars but after I took out my sew in that had been up for about six months my hair was a mess and after my husband deep conditioned it and washed it I used this product as a leave in and it just doesn&#x27;t moisturize my hair. I have also tried this product dry a couple of days ago and maybe I put too much on but it left my hair white and then the next day it was a snow storm whenever I scratched my hair. I have to wash and deep condition again because of this stuff. It says not greasy but it is not weightless to me and very greasy even in my daughter&#x27;s hair. I will not be using this product again. But a girl on youtube with similar type hair as me, kind of, swears by this and it works awesome for her but she does use other products and from what I have seen, has used it on damp hair. So it may work for you, I hope it does.</li>
    <li> I love the moisture that this gives my kinky hair. A mist of water and a quarter size drop and I&#x27;m good for the rest of the day!!!</li>
    <li> Love the way it moisturized my hair and made my natural curls pop....</li>
    <li> Leaves a white film to hair unless mixed with coconut oil, or other products.</li>
    <li> I Love the slip on this product... it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or build up on my scalp. Good inexpensive Leave IN. I will definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> This conditioner does what it needs to. The consistency isgood, and it keeps hair soft and moisturized without feeling weighed down.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected - leaves my hair feeling dry.</li>
    <li> I like it, I don&#x27;t love it. If you&#x27;re a natural looking for a leave in with good slip that&#x27;s heavy enough for 4a-c hair, it&#x27;s a good one, but I&#x27;ve been natural my whole life and when I was a broke college girl, I used Suave Conditioner as a leave in (and for everything else) and it was just as good. Honestly, it&#x27;s not worth the price unless you&#x27;re not concerned about price. I&#x27;d stick with tresseme or even suave coconut for a good smell, good slip and great conditioning. I like it and I understand why so many girls like it because it SAYS leave in while still being heavy enough to provide slip and deep moisture, but you can use regular conditioner as leave in, check the ingredients! They&#x27;re exactly the same as a regular conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is a great leave-in.  I have natural hair and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products. It&#x27;s been very challenging finding a product that actually conditions and softens my hair. I even tried the shingling technique with it and my curls were popping! Giovanni Leave-in is a keeper. My daughters tried it and they loved it also. I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> My wife has been looking for something that work&#x27;s in her French, Porter Rican naturally curly hair for years. Which i might add is beautiful! Just in case she may read this! Heh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this for her and she loves it!</li>
    <li> All I can say is this conditioner is AMAZING in my 4b-c hair. this is the 1st and only conditioner I have ordered (and I am a PJ) that works wonders for moisturizing and defining my twists when mixed with aloe gel and essential oils.  NO frizz and the style lasts 4-5 days too. IM IN LOVE!</li>
    <li> My daughter has THICK , curly hair and this is the first product that has helped me manage her hair without breaking the bank! I just apply some in the mornings, before swimming &amp; after baths. Love it!</li>
    <li> This product was just ok for me, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again and not that it is bad but I would rather try something else...</li>
    <li> This has great slip and makes detangling easy HOWEVER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the leading ingredients was ALCOHOL. Great while the hair was wet but left it feeling dry ( even though i deep conditioned with another type of conditioner which left my hair soft). I will probably only use this for styling in addition to gel if I&#x27;m about to wash my hair soon after.</li>
    <li> Spend my time going from store to store with hopes i could find it after hearing how amazing it is. I Purchased and i have to say, the actual actual conditioner is much better than this product I really don&#x27;t see what the rave is about it didn&#x27;t do anything out of the ordinary. I don&#x27;t like the thin consistancy of tgis product for my 4c coily hair. I thought the leave-in would have a very thick and creamy consistency like the conditioner. Won&#x27;t  but it again.</li>
    <li> Wet conditioner. I use my conditioner but condition and style, so that&#x27;s not a great thing...but it conditioned really well. Beware it also has a but of a film feel after it absorbs</li>
    <li> I have not seen any real benefits to using this leave in.  It does help detangle the hair before blowdrying.  It also has a nice scent to it.</li>
    <li> I love this product on my transitioning hair.</li>
    <li> LLLLOOOOVVVVEEE!!!!!!!!! If I had known about this earlier. I read some reviews on the internet and so many have suggested this product. I was skeptical at first because I have purchased so many products for my daughter&#x27;s long thick hair but OMG!!!! This with the Crave Naturals detangling brush works wonders and I don&#x27;t need anything else. Boy I have purchased some products over the years and her hair doesn&#x27;t respond to any of it. I will not buy another leave in conditioner for her hair.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to matter how little I use my hair feels limp and almost greasy. It conditions well, but the greasy feeling isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> Left my hair feeling sticky and weighed down.</li>
    <li> I have been using this leave-in for a couple of months and boy is it good. Like advertised, it leaves my hair feeling soft, hydrated and smooth topped off with olive oil and shea moisture&#x27;s curl enchancing smoothie. I never thought my hair could feel so soft and moisturized, yet not be greasy. This has definetely become one of my staples.</li>
    <li> Works very well and smells pleasant. I have thick curly hair and this conditioner works great for my curls and for styling purposes.</li>
    <li> This leaves a greasy film on my hair and doesn&#x27;t do much for thickness either. Waste of money as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
    <li> I am editing this review after further use (I think its been about 4 weeks now). I have found that in extremely humid and hot whether this is not enough. At first I thought I could use this without any styling product but when its very hot, I definitely need gel for my curls. Still a great product but I definitely have to mix it with additional conditioners and I also think its better when your hair is damp. I think for me it will be better as a detangler after washing. My prior review is below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used this product for a week but let me tell you I love this product.  It can be used daily and it washes out easily.  I typically don&#x27;t review hair products until I have used it for some time because in the past I have found out later that the product wasn&#x27;t as great as I thought but this one is so amazing.  There was instant gratification after using this product.  My hair feels smooth and looks so rich. I also used this on my daughter&#x27;s thick long hair and saw the same results.  I did mix this product with coconut oil and apricot oil but I can tell that the product itself is great because I don&#x27;t get the same results when mixing these oils with other high end products.  Some reviews I read commented on the 8.5fl oz not being enough for the cost but I buy a lot of high end product and this is in my opinion a great value.  I initially used way too much because the product flowed out of the bottle so easily which made me think it was going to be too watery but a little of this product goes a long way so now I try to be careful when I squeeze the bottle not to get too much.  I typically wet my hair daily and so I have used this product daily for a week and I still have half a bottle. I think this could easily last 2-3 weeks for someone who likes to daily condition their hair and longer for those who don&#x27;t wet their hair as much.  For those of you who are interested in hair types, I have tight curly hair that is textured but not very thick and shoulder length and I dye it a lot (currently i have 3 colors one being blonde) and my daughter has extremely thick long curly textured hair. I think this product however could be used on any hair type or texture because its so light.</li>
    <li> Truly great for my thin hair.  It is weightless as it says and works very well with my hair texture.</li>
    <li> My experience with this product has not been all that dramatic but I like it all the same. I guess using it with other Giovanni products will produce better results</li>
