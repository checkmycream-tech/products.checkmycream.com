    <li> This is a misleading photo and product description, where the adapter will NOT fit into a regular US standard 2 prong power cord, rather it was an international power cord of some kind.  This is useless in the US.    UPDATE:  CyberStyle is NOT a good company to work with, and only offered me a partial refund, even thought I cannot use this product at all, and detailed and provided photos that this product is not as described/photographed.  Then I was offered an even a smaller refund, and filed a claim with this company.  Thank goodness for Amazon&#x27;s A to Z guarantee.</li>
    <li> This thingus not even worth one dollard. The product is trash, was broken before I even got it out of the box. The adapter doesnt look anything like the one pictured. The adapter I recieved looks like a phone charger.... DO NOT BUY THIS WORTHLESS PIECE OF JUNK.</li>
    <li> Used it for the first time yesterday it works pretty good if youre just trying to do simple things I did notice a couple of times it would just shut off so hopefully that doesn&#x27;t continue.</li>
    <li> the provider responsible good experience , impeccable product , I recommend it with my eyes closed , waiting for more credits to repurchase them</li>
    <li> did not work right will not buy again stuff missing out of it  don&#x27;t buy from this seller  sells you bad products. You will have to return it.</li>
    <li> I like that it arrived fast, but it came with a loose part and it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> It works great love the pink</li>
    <li> It was a gift to my daughter and she has not told me if it is good or not</li>
    <li> I was really excited when I got it. As soon as I plugged and started using it, it stopped. Overheated?? I don&#x27;t know. I guess I&#x27;ll be returning it.</li>
    <li> The whole experience was horrible</li>
    <li> This nail art drill is just what I expected it to be and I will recommend to others who ask me where I purchased my electric nail art drill. The packaging wasn&#x27;t damaged and I received it within a reasonable time after purchasing. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this drill. I&#x27;ve used it several times. The size and the fact that it&#x27;s not loud are a huge plus.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good it here early. You can control the speed at the end of the drill.</li>
    <li> It was vairly workable, not well great.</li>
    <li> On/off switch broke first time I used it.  Is now stuck on high.</li>
    <li> At first I could not figure it out. The instructions given with the drill tell you nothing except common sence stuff. I hope this helps so here goes. hold down the silver stop button located near the drill head. Unscrew the black ring........slip it over the silver head. Then unscrew the silver head and you will see the bit holder. Place the desired bit into the holder and then take it out. Screw the silver head back on (while holding the silver brake button down) then put the black ring back ....place the bit into the drill and your ready to go. It works great and has adjustable speeds. I&#x27;m so glad I bought this item.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even want to give one star It was broken didn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Works great! I&#x27;ve seen negative reviews for this and I feel really good about this purchase! I do my own acrylic nails and it works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> It arrived today and I couldn&#x27;t wait to use.  Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t because the drill bit would not stay in the drill.  I will be returning this item.</li>
    <li> The attached pieces don&#x27;t fit</li>
    <li> only complaint...over heats to quickly</li>
