      <li>I have mixed opinions on this product, while this product does a great job as a detangler, it just does not work as a hair spray as good.  </li>
      <li>Love my product.</li>
      <li>I use it on my 6 yr olds fine hair that tangles very easily.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey but works great!!!!!</li>
      <li>The best for little kids hair</li>
      <li>Paul Mitchell Taming Spray has made a huge difference in getting a brush or comb through her hair in the morning.</li>
      <li>It leaves her hair smooth and not frizzy even though she has curly hair.</li>
      <li>In any case, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the original product.</li>
      <li>Smelled way too sweet to be the Paul Mitchell product I ordered.</li>
      <li>It also lasts a good while because you don&#x27;t need a ton of it to actually work.</li>

      <li>Makes getting ready in the morning a lot easier!</li>
      <li>This has a wonderful fragrance and doesn&#x27;t seem to weigh my girls hair down like the other two.  </li>
      <li>I have used it both on wet and dry hair both with great results, the comb glides right on through.</li>
      <li>Felt as if they filled the correct bottle with a cheap imitation....</li>
      <li>My son has beautiful red curly hair but it can be a beast to tame.</li>
      <li>But it does seem to style it a little, kind of like a gel would.</li>
      <li>This product makes brushing your hair so much</li>
      <li>Works very well as a detangler.</li>
      <li>It holds the style better than just combing wet hair would.</li>
      <li>less or no scent would be better.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light enough to do the job and not weigh the hair down too much with goop.</li>
      <li>it does the trick as far as detangling is concerned.</li>
      <li>This is the only way I can easily brush my little girl&#x27;s hair.  </li>
      <li>my complaint is it has a strong scent</li>
      <li>first time we tried something other than Johnson&#x27;s or Suave.  </li>
      <li>When I ran out of the first bottle I tried other salon leave in conditioner sprays for her</li>
      <li>and so far this only works for detangling her hair and not for the freeze.</li>
      <li>the 2nd bottle however seemed to be the correct formula since I still had a bottle half full that I purchased from Ulta near by not too long before.</li>
      <li>So, if you use it and comb the hair a certain direction, it will stay that way for a little while.</li>

    <li> I have mixed opinions on this product, while this product does a great job as a detangler, it just does not work as a hair spray as good.  My daughter has very thin hair and so far this only works for detangling her hair and not for the freeze.</li>
    <li> If you or your kids have tangled hair then this is the product for you. My daughter has very long hair that is tangle prone. Paul Mitchell Taming Spray has made a huge difference in getting a brush or comb through her hair in the morning. This stuff is amazing, it smells good, not like perfume but just a nice, benign smell. It isn&#x27;t heavy, doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down and even helps with styling. I have used it both on wet and dry hair both with great results, the comb glides right on through. Even the really tough snarls are much easier with this spray.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> We love this stuff for our son.  He&#x27;s been using it ever since he was a toddler.  Works much better than just water.</li>
    <li> This spray is great for getting out little tangles!&lt;br /&gt;I also like to use it for a taming spray...as a bonus&lt;br /&gt;it smells really good! I love that it does not smell like fruit&lt;br /&gt;or flowers...but still good!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I use it on my 6 yr olds fine hair that tangles very easily. When I ran out of the first bottle I tried other salon leave in conditioner sprays for her and they did not compare. This does not build up on her hair no matter how much I use, smells good, and... Works!  This is a necessity in our house.</li>
    <li> Received 2 bottles...one was the correct product. The other? I&#x27;m not sure what was inside the bottle? Smelled way too sweet to be the Paul Mitchell product I ordered. Felt as if they filled the correct bottle with a cheap imitation....the 2nd bottle however seemed to be the correct formula since I still had a bottle half full that I purchased from Ulta near by not too long before. M&lt;br /&gt;Unless I get a response back from them....I would not purchase again from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
    <li> I keep this around to brush the tangles out of my toddler&#x27;s long hair.  Makes getting ready in the morning a lot easier!</li>
    <li> it does the trick as far as detangling is concerned. my complaint is it has a strong scent and I get congested from perfumy scents. less or no scent would be better.</li>
    <li> This works amazing for my daughters fine tangled hair.</li>
    <li> This product makes brushing your hair so much easier!&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t one of those rip-off hair detanglers that just smells good.&lt;br /&gt;But that&#x27;s the problem, it smells awful!</li>
    <li> This is the only way I can easily brush my little girl&#x27;s hair.  She has very fine hair but lots of it.  Therefore, it tangles a lot.  This was used by the children&#x27;s hair salon and it works great.</li>
    <li> Love this product....first time we tried something other than Johnson&#x27;s or Suave.  This has a wonderful fragrance and doesn&#x27;t seem to weigh my girls hair down like the other two.  It&#x27;s a little pricey but works great!!!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE for taming curly hair!! My son has beautiful red curly hair but it can be a beast to tame. I can spray this on his hair and the comb just glides through his hair. Then I give his hair a good tousle and it&#x27;s back to it&#x27;s curly springy state as opposed to a matted frizzy mess. It also lasts a good while because you don&#x27;t need a ton of it to actually work.</li>
    <li> The best for little kids hair</li>
    <li> Love my product. Great transaction.</li>
    <li> The product I had been using was a taming spray with a leave in conditioner.  I couldn&#x27;t find it when I searched, and hoped the Taming Spray unisex  would be a good substitute.  That might not be what I received.  Because of the &amp;#34;bubble gum&amp;#34; scent, I think what I was sent is a product for children.  In any case, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the original product.</li>
    <li> my daughters hair is so fine and gets tangled easy, I use this every morning and her hair looks so beautiful, I would recommend this product to anyone who has problem with dryness or frizz. I need to stock up!</li>
    <li> Works very well as a detangler. Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling greasy. But it does seem to style it a little, kind of like a gel would. So, if you use it and comb the hair a certain direction, it will stay that way for a little while. It holds the style better than just combing wet hair would. It also has a pleasant gender-neutral scent.</li>
    <li> Works great for my kid&#x27;s tangles. It leaves her hair smooth and not frizzy even though she has curly hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for keeping my kids&#x27; wispy hair in place.  It&#x27;s light enough to do the job and not weigh the hair down too much with goop.</li>
