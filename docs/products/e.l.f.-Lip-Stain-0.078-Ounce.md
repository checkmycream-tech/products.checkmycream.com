      <li>(it wasn&#x27;t absolutely perfect, but hey what makeup application is??)</li>
      <li>and their customer service is great.  </li>
      <li>and it works great</li>
      <li>I own this and nude nectar, which are both beautiful colors.</li>
      <li>I really loved the color as well.</li>
      <li>its a good product but</li>
      <li>Anyway, I am very pleased with the color and the wearability.  </li>
      <li>So based on Crimson Crush I very pleased with this</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>My favorite lip stain!</li>
      <li>I love this color and it lasts longer than any of my lip stains!</li>
      <li>Some of them are awesome (shimmer glosses) and some of them, not so much (</li>
      <li>I love this product fast shipping awesome</li>
      <li>and I like that the colour stays on even after I put on a top layer of lip balm</li>
      <li>I happen to have a great fondness for bright red lip colors</li>
      <li>However, I don&#x27;t like that it feels like it takes too many swipes just to cover my lips.</li>
      <li>(For what it&#x27;s worth, my lips are in good shape to start with, and that may make a difference.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The tip on this comes to a very fine point at the end so for me I found it quite easy to apply this with precision.</li>
      <li>I was really excited to try this lip stain!</li>
      <li>ELF is very affordable and often good, but there are better affordable options in stains.</li>
      <li>It did not seem to go on as smooth and the color seemed more watery.</li>
      <li>so this is fine for me.</li>
      <li>After outlining my lips with the fine point, I then used the side of the applicator to fill in my lips.  </li>
      <li>The color flowed freely and went on fairly smooth and even</li>
      <li>great deep wine color</li>
      <li>I only paid a couple of dollars for this, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
      <li>It goes on even and smoothly.</li>
      <li>I applied this to clean, oil free lips</li>
      <li>First of all, I LOVE this</li>
      <li>I find with both of them that I sometimes have to go over certain areas twice, but I&#x27;m OK with that.&lt;br</li>
      <li>That being said, I actually like this lip stain fairly well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect red for bold red lips.</li>
      <li>More red than I expected, but still very good.</li>
      <li>It came in great condition, but the color is more of a deep red than crimson.</li>
      <li>IF your lips are in really good shape - no cracks or dry spots!</li>
      <li>I really like that it has a fine point.</li>
      <li>If I always applied it on freshly exfoliated lips</li>
      <li>but I thought it worth mentioning.</li>
      <li>The red is a nice colour</li>
      <li>It dries out pretty quick</li>
      <li>It dried quickly and seems to have pretty good staying power.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few stains of different brands, but elf is the best.</li>
      <li>It is a very wearable and pretty color.</li>
      <li>It is basically a very light wash of pink.</li>
      <li>color is, indeed, a pretty bold red (mine was &amp;#34;Crimson Crush&amp;#34;).</li>
      <li>but the product did not adhere to my lips no matter how much I tried.</li>
      <li>and yes i closed the top on it...</li>
      <li>It is like the color of your real lips taken up a notch.</li>
      <li>I really like the color</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>It is a true old school Hollywood/bombshell red.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s true of nearly all lip stains, but especially with a deeper color like this.</li>
      <li>, I was surprised that the color was still vibrant even after blotting my lips with</li>
      <li>have used other lip stains that cost more money and do not have the same wearability.</li>
      <li>It is a bit drying, but the color is so lovely I looked past that</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely dry my lips out and the colors are the right shades.</li>
      <li>and I noticed that as well, but all I did was go over the uneven area and it looked fine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I actually find this fairly easy to apply; I have another lipstain with a similar applicator from Revlon and this elf one is similar in coverage to that</li>
      <li>Wow was I surprised.</li>
      <li>that could also be because the product itself looked old.</li>
      <li>Wish it was a bit longer lasting, but otherwise it&#x27;s a decent product for my purposes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not nearly as dark as it seems it would be....</li>
      <li>it dried out really quickly..</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a bit lighter than I expected (lighter than the package color), but it&#x27;s still very gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;Because of my skin tone, I like to go with darker shades and this is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This lip stain, however was just a bit of a let down; the stain was pretty drippy</li>
      <li>I have never really been much for lip stains, but this one was only $2</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few stains of different brands, but elf is the best. It doesn&#x27;t completely dry my lips out and the colors are the right shades. Love it!</li>
    <li> So wandering around Target I saw this one day. I have never really been much for lip stains, but this one was only $2 so I figured what the heck. If I don&#x27;t like it no biggie. Wow was I surprised. The tip on this comes to a very fine point at the end so for me I found it quite easy to apply this with precision. The color flowed freely and went on fairly smooth and even (it wasn&#x27;t absolutely perfect, but hey what makeup application is??) I really loved the color as well. I got this in \\&quot;Crimson Crush\\&quot;. It is a true old school Hollywood/bombshell red. It dried quickly and seems to have pretty good staying power. I even applied lip gloss over it to see...and it didn&#x27;t budge. I had to use makeup remover to get it off! I also got the \\&quot;Berry Blush\\&quot; color but was not as impressed with that one. It did not seem to go on as smooth and the color seemed more watery. I&#x27;m not sure if I just got a bad one or if varies by color to how well it applies.. but I thought it worth mentioning. So based on Crimson Crush I very pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: since writing this review I also purchased pink petal. I really like it. It goes on even and smoothly. It is basically a very light wash of pink. It is like the color of your real lips taken up a notch. It is a very wearable and pretty color.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I was looking for an alternative to lipsticks and glosses, and I feel this is it. The red is a nice colour and I like that the colour stays on even after I put on a top layer of lip balm, it&#x27;s buildable too.  However, I don&#x27;t like that it feels like it takes too many swipes just to cover my lips. I&#x27;m thinking of buying the other colours.</li>
    <li> My favorite lip stain!</li>
    <li> Goes on way to uneven fades fast but I guess u get what u pay for sometimes, used it once not again</li>
    <li> I was a bit disappointed with this lip stain, which is shocking because I normally love E.L.F products in general. This lip stain, however was just a bit of a let down; the stain was pretty drippy and then the tip dried out after one use.</li>
    <li> First of all, I LOVE this color!&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit lighter than I expected (lighter than the package color), but it&#x27;s still very gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;Because of my skin tone, I like to go with darker shades and this is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, the big con is that i cannot wear this by itself... after applying it, it looks uneven and no matter how much I try, I cannot fix it.&lt;br /&gt;So I don&#x27;t waste it, I just apply a similar shade of lipstick over it.</li>
    <li> I have a love-hate relationship with elf products. Some of them are awesome (shimmer glosses) and some of them, not so much (I&#x27;m not thrilled with my elf mascara). That being said, I actually like this lip stain fairly well. (For what it&#x27;s worth, my lips are in good shape to start with, and that may make a difference.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually find this fairly easy to apply; I have another lipstain with a similar applicator from Revlon and this elf one is similar in coverage to that (more expensive) one. I find with both of them that I sometimes have to go over certain areas twice, but I&#x27;m OK with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is, indeed, a pretty bold red (mine was &amp;#34;Crimson Crush&amp;#34;). I happen to have a great fondness for bright red lip colors so this is fine for me. I even took a risk and wore it to work today, though it&#x27;s a bit bolder than my usual look. I put gloss over it to keep my lips from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t last all day, though, especially if you are eating and drinking throughout the day. I did not reapply the stain today, because I wanted to see how long it would last, but I think next time, I will probably do a touch up after lunch. There was still color at the end of the day, but it had rubbed off unevenly. I did have to use makeup remover to get the remainder of it off, once I got home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering I only paid a couple of dollars for this, I&#x27;m happy with it. Wish it was a bit longer lasting, but otherwise it&#x27;s a decent product for my purposes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected. It&#x27;s very similar to a highlighter pen. It dries out pretty quick</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not nearly as dark as it seems it would be.... that could also be because the product itself looked old.</li>
    <li> It came in great condition, but the color is more of a deep red than crimson.</li>
    <li> It barley shows up on my lips!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the same texture and pigment as a crayola washable marker.</li>
    <li> I really like the color and it works great IF your lips are in really good shape - no cracks or dry spots! Otherwise, the color applies and wears unevenly. That&#x27;s true of nearly all lip stains, but especially with a deeper color like this. If I always applied it on freshly exfoliated lips (I use MaryKay Satin Lips occasionally), it lasts for hours. if not, I&#x27;d say it lasts a long time at least 75% of the time.</li>
    <li> The product does not stay on the lips to create a stain. I applied this to clean, oil free lips but the product did not adhere to my lips no matter how much I tried.</li>
    <li> I own this and nude nectar, which are both beautiful colors. The sad part being that the stain itself and color is just patchy and inconsistent. The felt tip itself is very stiff as well and unpleasant to apply. It is a bit drying, but the color is so lovely I looked past that but the patchiness and difficulty in application rendered them useless for me. ELF is very affordable and often good, but there are better affordable options in stains.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this lip stain! 1. really hard to apply the tip is really small and the appliccation always looks not even and really patchy! 2. the lasting effect sucks.. whenever i apply it and drink something i can see my tongue turning red and all my color fading away! im not buying this product again!</li>
    <li> its a good product but it dried out really quickly..i mean in like 2 weeks it was like a dried out marker and yes i closed the top on it...also it started smelling a bit weird ...I will not be buying it again from this company maybe another</li>
    <li> I love this product fast shipping awesome&lt;br /&gt;Best seller</li>
    <li> I love this color and it lasts longer than any of my lip stains! It&#x27;s the perfect red for bold red lips.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking &amp;#34;it&#x27;s only $2&amp;#34; and it wouldn&#x27;t kill me to try it. Besides, I bought this at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and their customer service is great.  Anyway, I am very pleased with the color and the wearability.  I really like that it has a fine point. After outlining my lips with the fine point, I then used the side of the applicator to fill in my lips.  My lips tingled a bit when I applied the color.&lt;br /&gt;After dinner, I was surprised that the color was still vibrant even after blotting my lips with a napkin.&lt;br /&gt;A reviewer had complained that the color was uneven and I noticed that as well, but all I did was go over the uneven area and it looked fine. Another reviewer had mentioned that if your lips are chapped, the stain will go into the cracks and you&#x27;ll have lines. My advice is not to use this lip stain, because if your lips are unhealthy, the stain will really sting and hurt. Use some coconut oil or lip balm at night to heal your lips. Once your lips heal, follow up by removing dead skin on your lips with a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I have used other lip stains that cost more money and do not have the same wearability. Go for it!</li>
    <li> great deep wine color</li>
    <li> More red than I expected, but still very good. It lasts all day.</li>
