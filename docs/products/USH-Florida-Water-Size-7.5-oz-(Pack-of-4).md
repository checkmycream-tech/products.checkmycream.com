      <li>It&#x27;s great splashed on after a hot shower, and looking forward to using it in the hot summer months ahead.</li>
      <li>Great product not too strong with just enough punch.</li>
      <li>By mixing 3 capfulls of Florida Water with a gallon of water and ice you have the best remedy to cool yourself down while playing tennis in this 95 degree heat.  </li>
      <li>Nice light fragrance doesn&#x27;t last very long but very Pleasant .</li>

<li> This prouct has been on the market for at least 50 years.</li>
<li> She loves the faint smell and the coolness supplied by the fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

    <li> This prouct has been on the market for at least 50 years. Those of us that buy this bright citrus after shave contine to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;My Dad introduced me to it many years ago when he taught me to shave. I have since introduced and given it as gifts to&lt;br /&gt;other family members.</li>
    <li> My Great Uncle and my Father used Florida Water, so I grew up with it and still use it. I&#x27;m 65 so that&#x27;s a lot of years in my family.</li>
    <li> Protection yes it is.</li>
    <li> If you are buying it, you now it. Awesome. Try some in a bowl of ice and water...soak a hand towel and enjoy the chill!</li>
    <li> Made purchase for several senior citizens in my family that loves the smell of Florida Water on them -  I must admit, the Florida Water smells better then Bengay on them.</li>
    <li> Vintage fragrance for a vintage guy.</li>
    <li> The best in it&#x27;s category. Have been using it for many years now and just keep on using the Florida Water. Great product not too strong with just enough punch.</li>
    <li> I always use this water. Great for relaxing and calming down after a bad day. I even gave one to my boyfriend and now he sprays it around the house. Once I&#x27;m done with these I&#x27;m buying more.</li>
    <li> Nice light fragrance doesn&#x27;t last very long but very Pleasant . Would definitely buy this again. For bottles should last a while</li>
    <li> Lucille Ball&#x27;s final words were &amp;#34;My Florida Water&amp;#34; A nurse at the hospital where she passed asked her if there was anything she wanted.and her reply was her Florida water.  I&#x27;d not heard of Florida water before so I had to order some just as a curiosity item . It smells like my Grandpa did after he shaved.  I ordered a four pack and gave out the bottles as gifts to friends of mine who I knew were Lucy fans. It made for a great thoughtful gift that they loved.. Buy it for that reason but not so much to actually wear it.</li>
    <li> Hard to go wrong with this ... great fresh scent!</li>
    <li> If it is plastic then they should let us know in the first place. It is a shame that quality Florida water like this should be contained in plastic bottles which I can&#x27;t stand. It makes the Florida water look cheap and fake. Now I got stuck with four of them. If people prefer to economize and choose plastic it is their choice and I respect that. To each his own. But I like the feel of glass on a hot summer day.</li>
    <li> this witches water is awsome in a bottle and the girls love it i get asked by so many ppl omg what are you waering lol</li>
    <li> Great Value.  My son uses this every day as a cologne and pick me up.</li>
    <li> I am so hooked on this stuff now. It&#x27;s great splashed on after a hot shower, and looking forward to using it in the hot summer months ahead. Shipped quickly and at a great price. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on positive reviews.  I wanted a light fragrance to use during the hot summer months.  This works really well.  I put it in a spritzer bottle and use it like a cologne. I also spray on a slightly damp wash cloth to wipe my feet and legs after gardening.  Has a great cooling effect and smells good too.  It also seems to repel mosquitoes.  A bonus for me! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great  item perfect for the price.</li>
    <li> Could not make it through the hot, humid Louisiana summers without Florida water. I had no idea this was something not known to everyone -- I&#x27;ve gotten so many friends using it (athletes, gardeners, fishermen, etc).</li>
    <li> Use a little bit of this add it to a cooler filled with ice then dip a towel and it will refresh you.  If your baseball player is falling or hurting because of heat exhaustion, this thing works wonder. However, I myself can&#x27;t stand perfume, candles, or household aerosole sprays so I did not take to it at all.  It smells great but after a while, a person like me got a head ache from the smell.  But kids on our baseball team loved it and thinks that it gave them some extra energy.  So I will use it again next summer season.</li>
    <li> I just love this stuff and this deal was too good to pass up!</li>
    <li> Loved the smell! Fresh!</li>
    <li> By mixing 3 capfulls of Florida Water with a gallon of water and ice you have the best remedy to cool yourself down while playing tennis in this 95 degree heat.  My whole tennis team is now using Florida Water !!  Just the fragrance alone is refreshing.</li>

She loves the faint smell and the coolness supplied by the fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already re-ordered just to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> My uncle loved this stuff.  He passed away two years ago but his son, my cousin, loves it, too.  He is in Canada so very happy I&#x27;m able to bring it to him so he avoids shipping!</li>
    <li> I only wish these had a spay attachment.</li>
    <li> I love this product I grew up with it the smell reminds me of my childhood.</li>
    <li> I parted with half the order &amp; presented them  as presents to friends. All comments were positive. I have postponed opening mine until after Thursday, April 9th, when I&#x27;ll be going on my trans-atlantic cruize. I shall consider another order when these run out.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a 4 Pack of Florida Water in GLASS bottles and it was in Plastic bottles.  Would not have ordered this item if I new it would be plastic.</li>
    <li> Awesome!  When I play tennis in the dead heat of summer in Florida, I mix 1/2 a bottle of this product with 2 cups of water and a bunch of ice in a small cooler with a rag and take it out to the tennis courts with me.  It is incredibly Refreshing and smells great!  Also, this was a great price for the 4 pack  :)</li>
    <li> more than just a cologne. I use it in so many other ways.</li>
    <li> Have used this water yet, but it comes very highly recommended in the hoodoo group I participate in. Looking forward to using it.</li>
