      <li>perfect 5 stars!</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful blush.  </li>
      <li>Great blush - have no idea why it was discontinued!  </li>
      <li>This blush doesnt washout my face at all and makes my cheek color perfect!</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly, great color.</li>
      <li>The Rose color is perfect for me.  </li>
      <li>so is the price, it is a great deal, and its gon</li>
      <li>it is the perfect blush for me, and I love how it goes on</li>
      <li>It stays in place for the most part and has a very beautiful look to it on the face cheeks.</li>
      <li>Great product and just the perfect amount of color for day time use but able to build up more color for a night on the town!</li>
      <li>The color is awesome, it goes on creamy, and is so easy to blend in.</li>
      <li>I loved this product which has been taken off the market some time ago.  </li>
      <li>I love this beautiful mousse blush.</li>
      <li>I really love this blush!</li>
      <li>I LOVE THE COLOR!</li>
      <li>I know that a cream blush is not for everybody, some people don&#x27;t like it, or it doesn&#x27;t go well with whatever foundation/powder they use, but for me, this works better than any blush I have!</li>
      <li>for my fair coloring this blush is the best I have ever found as it looks natural</li>
      <li>I liked everything about it</li>
      <li>it goes on very smooth, doesn&#x27;t streak, or streak my makeup</li>
      <li>super fast shipping which was awesome!</li>
      <li>I am a fair-skinned brunette &amp; love</li>
      <li>It turns into more of a powder once placed on your cheeks-</li>
      <li>I recommend this purchase :-)</li>
      <li>Love this blush.  </li>
      <li>I love this blush.</li>
      <li>Very light and easily applied.  </li>
      <li>really smooth but too many sparkles</li>
      <li>It applies and blends so easily,  and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>I find this blush more original and worth it!</li>
      <li>It is creamy and light</li>
      <li>a bit more golden shimmer to it than i would like</li>
      <li>it has a great texture and can look natural and fresh if applied the right way</li>
      <li>Gently blend it on the apples of your cheeks and then top with a translucent powder</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very sheer as well, so you may need to reapply to get a good color depth.</li>
      <li>My complexion is more to the light/medium range, so it doesn&#x27;t show up so much.</li>
      <li>This blush is a beautiful rose color that I can imagine would look great on pretty much anyone as long as their skin is somewhat pale.</li>
      <li>, how smooth it is, how little it takes, how it doesn&#x27;t fade away throughout the day, and last all day, couldn&#x27;t ask for more from a blush, this is beyond perfect!</li>
      <li>and it does not break out my sensitive skin, which is very important and a huge</li>
      <li>this soft, build able color.  </li>
      <li>this shows up just right</li>
      <li>(it didn&#x27;t sink into my large pores to create blush colored blackheads!) except the size.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably blow through this blush in less than 6 months, since it takes a fair amount to get a result.</li>
      <li>This cream blush goes on smoothly and gives a natural glow.  </li>
      <li>I also use a darker shade of this blush under my cheek bones to give the appearance of higher cheekbones and the two work well together.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call it a \\&quot;cream\\&quot; blush, as the cream blushes I have tried before resemble a glue stick packaging.</li>
      <li>Not a natural look, but its cute for those who like glitter and shimmer.</li>
      <li>You can barely see it when you apply it, you must use a significant amount to make your cheeks pop.</li>
      <li>I may do a touch up, if I am touching up my make up from wearing all day and plan to go out at night as well, but other than that</li>
      <li>where other cream blushes are more sticky.</li>
      <li>and I use MANY different powders and foundations, in different combos,</li>
      <li>The blush has a shimmery tint which I believe makes it just a little bit better.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to normally touch it up.</li>
      <li>I thought it would be darker but its a little too light for me and its very glittery.</li>
      <li>New one they came out with to replace it is horrible!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>I should give more stars to this item since a paid like 4 bucks, but the color is definitely not what I expected.</li>
      <li>It has a glow on your cheeks which looks very natural</li>
      <li>fantastic delivery - had it in my mailbox in less than a week.</li>
      <li>it does not have a smooth finish and also a little sticky..over all its below my expectations.</li>
      <li>My powder blushes last much longer than this...</li>
      <li>Yet, I like it since it looks extremely natural.</li>
      <li>No luck so far...</li>
      <li>I have super pale skin</li>
      <li>I decided to go for something that is a little in my budget right now.</li>
      <li>This light, almost fluffy mousse blush smooths out to a soft, natural flush with just a little bit of shimmer.  </li>

<li> But I guess its ok to use it for work or on a casual day.</li>
<li> , it only takes a little bit, a little will go a long way, so this will last a little while, even though I use it pretty much every day!</li>
<li> all the time, I have many, and depending on what im doing that day, I wear different ones, but I always wear this blush with all of them, and I have not had a problem with any of them mixing wrong or it causing a streaking or any other type of problem with any of  my different makeup combos.</li>
<li> I really liked the color, but I think I got a bad product or something</li>
<li> This blush works well for both my mother and I; I bought two different shades, one pink and one peachy-coral.</li>
<li> I use it sparingly as you only need a little bit to brighten up your cheeks.</li>
<li> na last a little while, so you cant beat it!!!</li>
<li> They didn&#x27;t blend into my face and it felt a little scratchy.</li>
<li> The color is not good..</li>
<li> and it is hard for me to find a color that does me justice!</li>
<li> Powder blush not great on drier skin, so this blush has been a blessing.</li>
<li> Too bad it was discontinued.</li>
<li> Very disappointed Maybelline discontinued it.</li>
<li> , it doesn&#x27;t mess with my makeup (foundation/powder) at all!!!!!!!!</li>

    <li> I have used this product for years and it is great! The color is awesome, it goes on creamy, and is so easy to blend in. Very disappointed Maybelline discontinued it. Amazon had it at a terrific price. I am so happy I could still find it!</li>
    <li> From Mac to Sephora- I have done it all. I decided to go for something that is a little in my budget right now. I came across this and I am now inlove! I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call it a \\&quot;cream\\&quot; blush, as the cream blushes I have tried before resemble a glue stick packaging. I have super pale skin and it is hard for me to find a color that does me justice! This blush doesnt washout my face at all and makes my cheek color perfect! The blush has a shimmery tint which I believe makes it just a little bit better. It turns into more of a powder once placed on your cheeks- where other cream blushes are more sticky. I find this blush more original and worth it!</li>
    <li> for my fair coloring this blush is the best I have ever found as it looks natural</li>
    <li> This cream blush goes on smoothly and gives a natural glow.  I can&#x27;t understand why Maybelline discontinued it!  There was and is nothing else out there like it.  I wish they would bring it back.</li>
    <li> I loved this product which has been taken off the market some time ago.  That&#x27;s why I hunt for it on line.  I&#x27;ve even written to Maybelline to bring it back.  No luck so far...</li>
    <li> Great product and just the perfect amount of color for day time use but able to build up more color for a night on the town! Lasts and lasts with out having to re apply . Would purchase again!</li>
    <li> I love this beautiful mousse blush. I use it sparingly as you only need a little bit to brighten up your cheeks. It stays in place for the most part and has a very beautiful look to it on the face cheeks. I recommend this purchase :-)</li>
    <li> Great blush - have no idea why it was discontinued!  New one they came out with to replace it is horrible!&lt;br /&gt;And fantastic delivery - had it in my mailbox in less than a week.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful blush.  It is creamy and light so you do not find yourself pulling at your skin to blend it (like the product that has replaced this on store shelves).  Gently blend it on the apples of your cheeks and then top with a translucent powder and it lasts all day.  I also use a darker shade of this blush under my cheek bones to give the appearance of higher cheekbones and the two work well together.</li>
    <li> The color is not good..it does not have a smooth finish and also a little sticky..over all its below my expectations.</li>
    <li> I should give more stars to this item since a paid like 4 bucks, but the color is definitely not what I expected. I don&#x27;t mind the sparkles, but It bothers me a lot the fact that it is almost translucent. You can barely see it when you apply it, you must use a significant amount to make your cheeks pop. But I guess its ok to use it for work or on a casual day.</li>
    <li> It applies and blends so easily,  and lasts all day. I like applying it with my fingers, instead of needing a brush.</li>
    <li> I really liked the color, but I think I got a bad product or something.. I know it&#x27;s supposed to be a mousse consistency, but mine was clumpy and had sandy grits in it. They didn&#x27;t blend into my face and it felt a little scratchy.</li>
    <li> really smooth but too many sparkles</li>
    <li> I really love this blush! I know that a cream blush is not for everybody, some people don&#x27;t like it, or it doesn&#x27;t go well with whatever foundation/powder they use, but for me, this works better than any blush I have!

I&#x27;ll probably blow through this blush in less than 6 months, since it takes a fair amount to get a result. My powder blushes last much longer than this...so I won&#x27;t be using this every day. I&#x27;m saving this for winter when my skin is paler &amp; hope it will last longer.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be darker but its a little too light for me and its very glittery. Not a natural look, but its cute for those who like glitter and shimmer. super fast shipping which was awesome!</li>
    <li> Very light and easily applied.  I like he texture.  It has a glow on your cheeks which looks very natural</li>
