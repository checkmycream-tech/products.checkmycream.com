    <li> This is the best mascara remover I&#x27;ve ever used. It is very gentle but extremely effective, especially with waterproof mascaras. I traveled recently and found an additional benefit: it is the only remover I&#x27;ve encountered that is kept in a tube and applied like mascara, so it takes up very little space in a cosmetics kit or luggage, unlike others that come in plastic tubs. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is the best waterproof mascara remover out there! If you have the KissMe Heroine Mascara, than this mascara remover is a MUST. I tried every other highly rated waterproof mascara remover out there, for a year and nothing really worked. I lost eyelashes, no joke!  Even the highly rated Clinique make up remover, or the Almay waterproof eye makeup remover pads, never really took off my mascara, even after waiting for the product to set, and basically having to scrub it off.  I nearly gave up on the Heroine Mascara even though it was my favorite, because taking it off was such a pain. Then I ordered this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this mascara remover, all you have to do is put it on your eyelashes, wait 30 seconds (or if you want, just brush your teeth while you wait), and rinse off your mascara.  If you&#x27;re like me and use a lot of mascara, it can be messy but I wash my face after removing mascara, so it is easy to fix. Also, trust me, this mascara remover is WAY more painless than any other option out there!</li>
    <li> It really helps to remove stubborn kiss me heroine mascara.</li>
    <li> Removes the most stubborn Japanese mascaras. I swipe it onto my lashes and immediately can tell that the mascara is disintegrating. Then I wipe it off with a bit of makeup remover. Works like a dream!</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that completely and easily removes all of my KissMe Heroine Long &amp; Curl Waterproof mascara.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the formula or the applicator - probably a bit of both.  I&#x27;ve tried Maybelline waterproof remover, Shesiedo waterproof remover, oils (Argan, Almond, Grape seed, and Olive), petroleum jellies (Vaseline and another brand), cleansing oils (Selma Hayek, Philosophy, DHC) and non-waterproof removers by Maybelline and Sephora.  It didn&#x27;t matter if I massaged those in with my fingers or used cotton pad, cotton balls or q-tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing works as well as this specific mascara remover.  All the other ones would leave mascara on my lashes (thus leading to them breaking) and some would burn my eyes.  I even tried pouring some of the other removers on a disposable mascara wand to see if that would work as well, but the disposable wand had so much dripping from it that it got in my eyes and still didn&#x27;t remove the mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely order this again!</li>
    <li> Love this makeup remover! It&#x27;s honestly the best one in the market.</li>
    <li> KissMe Mascara Remover makes my life easier. I apply mascara remover for 1 or 2 minutes before I use cotton bud with my regular makeup remover to brush off mascara from my eyelashes. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It works well to remove mascara.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing is it&#x27;s bit rough, and it can hurt you.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it is the wand or remover that make it work so well.&lt;br /&gt;I think after I finish using this, I am going to feel it with eye makeup remover and see how well it work.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara! GET THE KISS ME HEROINE REMOVER! builds nicely,very black, minimal flaking/smudging. Will repurchase.</li>
    <li> I love the mascara and it&#x27;s staying power...but when I want to take it off every night it&#x27;s so difficult! This is a must if you use the mascara because it helps strip it off very easily. No more pulling out lashes!</li>
    <li> Why do we need this? My gel eye make up remover does exact same job as this one. But I guess it helps with not scrubbing to remove it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a long time because I use kissme heroine mascara. I should use this to remove the mascara. Other removers don&#x27;t work out well. SO EASY to apply.</li>
    <li> Very easy to remove the makeup! Better than any remover that I used before.</li>
    <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
    <li> Not all that! Great staying power, but don&#x27;t hold curl for me.</li>
    <li> I used this remover along with the Heroine Make Long &amp; Curl mascara, and let me tell you, this is the ONLY thing I own that makes that stubborn mascara glide off my lashes like water. I love the Heroine Make mascara to pieces, but it&#x27;s a bitch to get off (a plus and a minus in my opinion). You can&#x27;t get that mascara off with regular waterproof makeup remover, so save your lashes some tugging and just buy this product. It comes in a cute pink bottle with a wand to brush the remover through your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula is oil-based, but it&#x27;s not irritating and won&#x27;t feel greasy on your skin. I think it actually moisturizes your lashes, too. But the important thing is, it&#x27;s a portable and easy solution to removing the hardest mascara to take off in the world.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t found any other mascara remover that can remove the Heroine mascara easily, not even the best &#x27;water-proof mascara remover&#x27;, so no substitution for this one yet.</li>
    <li> Purchased this with the mascara. Highly recommend this product. Completely removes the mascara which is difficult with other brands of eye makeup remover. The product is easy to apply and remove. Lasts a long time too!</li>
    <li> Takes off KissMe Heroine mascara speedy quick. But if you are like me and use multiple coast of mascara you may have to  use this twice. Does not burn. Love the KissMe Heroine Mascara by the way</li>
    <li> Takes off my Heroine Make super waterproof mascara in seconds and doesn&#x27;t sting or make my eyes blurry. I can get my mascara off with other products but this is the fastest and easiest.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing,  very gentle, fast remove any brands of my waterproof mascara, shipping also very fast, directly from Japan only took 11 days.</li>
    <li> I use Shiseido Majolica Majorca Lash expander and this removes it very very well. Nothing else seems to work.</li>
    <li> This works really well!</li>
    <li> Took some time getting here but works incredibly well!  I must if you use their mascara.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> So... I bought the heroine mascara and read tons of reviews about how hard it was to get off or how &#x27;long-lasting&#x27; it was, depending on your outlook.  As a preemptive strike, I ordered this makeup remover.  It is FABULOUS.  I just swipe it on my lashes, let it sit for a minute and then use an Almay eye makeup remover pad to wipe the mascara away.  No tugging, no flaking, no problems.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this to go with the also awesome mascara</li>
