      <li>Looks very nice and the best price I found.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great razor.</li>
      <li>Great service.</li>
      <li>This is a great buy.</li>
      <li>it is very effective and inexpensive to use .</li>
      <li>Just like the one I was issued in the Marine Corps in 1970,  Good Razor.</li>
      <li>Good service and good price.</li>
      <li>, beaver hair brush to work up and apply lather and a good shaving soap.</li>
      <li>Came in fast, great price!</li>
      <li>nice razor, shaves very smooth .</li>
      <li>It was at this point one of the hinged top pieces fell off.</li>
      <li>So glad I found this at Amazon</li>
      <li>Definitely one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
      <li>When I recivied this product it looked like it has aready been used - the top looked like it was rusted and pitted</li>
      <li>The razor is every bit as good as the higher priced &amp;#34;name&amp;#34; brands.</li>
      <li>but very light and cheap made I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again</li>
      <li>it is too light.</li>
      <li>Purchased this item in hopes of finding a good old fashioned shave.</li>
      <li>.i guess its true</li>
      <li>He absolutely loves it!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very cheap made will not last no time the old ones was a lot heavlies than this one</li>
      <li>A very rugged and classy way to shave; very cost effective(cheap)</li>
      <li>However, because I shave my scalp (nearly bald anyway) I really do need a shaving kit.</li>
      <li>This old fashioned beats disposable razors by a country mile..</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not the old fashions ones at all it just made like them</li>
      <li>He fixed it, but he hasn&#x27;t used it since.</li>
      <li>but classy.</li>
      <li>He said it was very nice,used it the same day.</li>
      <li>the razor and blades were cheap but my face was solid red since I was bleeding all over my face since this single blade razor just hacked up my face.  </li>
      <li>Doesnt work as well as a modern safety razor but with practice it will do the same job with a 10 pack of refill blades starting under $2</li>
      <li>The razor broke the second time my husband used it, and he nearly whacked his face off as the blade was sticking out at an angle before he realized it.  </li>
      <li>Especially since he can just buy regular old razor blades for it.</li>
      <li>A ultra smooth shave that dates back a million years, or at least back before multi-blade razors existed!!</li>

    <li> nice razor, shaves very smooth . Good service and good price.</li>
    <li> So glad I found this at Amazon, I looked everywhere and this was a gift for my fiance and he loves it!</li>
    <li> i recieved this razor in the mail .i pulled it out of the box and one of the gaurds was broke. i gave it a try on the other side horrible feel .i guess its true you get what you pay for  . would not recomond</li>
    <li> This old fashioned beats disposable razors by a country mile..it is very effective and inexpensive to use . A Winner !</li>
    <li> it is too light. the fact that it is an open comb is not an issue. the design of the razor over all is poor. It doesn&#x27;t close or open properly.</li>
    <li> A very rugged and classy way to shave; very cost effective(cheap) but classy. A ultra smooth shave that dates back a million years, or at least back before multi-blade razors existed!!</li>
    <li> The razor is every bit as good as the higher priced &amp;#34;name&amp;#34; brands. However, because I shave my scalp (nearly bald anyway) I really do need a shaving kit. Shaving oil to pretreat my skin, beaver hair brush to work up and apply lather and a good shaving soap. Shopping for the kit next. This is a great buy.</li>
    <li> Came in fast, great price! Looks very nice and the best price I found. Would use them again in the future!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very cheap made will not last no time the old ones was a lot heavlies than this one it&#x27;s not the old fashions ones at all it just made like them but very light and cheap made I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again are suggest anyone else to but them</li>
    <li> I have had three heart attacks so I take lots of blood thinners.  I am also disabled so I am poor.  the razor and blades were cheap but my face was solid red since I was bleeding all over my face since this single blade razor just hacked up my face.  Do not buy this product it is horrible.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT work for few months then fell apart.</li>
    <li> Doesnt work as well as a modern safety razor but with practice it will do the same job with a 10 pack of refill blades starting under $2</li>
    <li> Hubby was looking for a less expensive way to shave. He said it took a try or two to get used to, but actually loves it. Especially since he can just buy regular old razor blades for it.</li>
    <li> Great service. Great product!</li>
    <li> Purchased this item in hopes of finding a good old fashioned shave. Although it arrived even earlier than expected it lasted only two uses. The razor itself didn&#x27;t hold the blade tightly allowing it to move during shaving. Upon inspection I discovered that the hinged closure did not engage all the way allowing slippage. It was at this point one of the hinged top pieces fell off. Save your money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great razor. Definitely one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
    <li> When I recivied this product it looked like it has aready been used - the top looked like it was rusted and pitted</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband because he was tired of the disposables and wanted a real razor. He absolutely loves it!</li>
    <li> Gentleman of 83 years had misplaced his and wanted a new one. Found this on Amazon. He said it was very nice,used it the same day. was a Christmas gift</li>
    <li> The razor broke the second time my husband used it, and he nearly whacked his face off as the blade was sticking out at an angle before he realized it.  We were not happy campers!!  He fixed it, but he hasn&#x27;t used it since.</li>
    <li> My head screw Broke off and the one I bought as a gift was broken upon arrival.</li>
    <li> Just like the one I was issued in the Marine Corps in 1970,  Good Razor.</li>
