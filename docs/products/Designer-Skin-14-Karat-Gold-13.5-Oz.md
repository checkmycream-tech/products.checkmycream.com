      <li>the smell was really light and the lotion went on great</li>
      <li>It absorbs into the skin so nice and when you get out of the bed you are not greasy nor sweaty.</li>
      <li>Unlike alot of tanning bed products, the scent of 14 Karat Gold is nice...</li>
      <li>however, a somewhat pleasant smell although the smell can be considered a strong after tan odor by some.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very strong</li>
      <li>Excellent lotion which I use daily with indoor tanning.  </li>
      <li>Everyone is different ofcourse, but it works great on me!</li>
      <li>I thought to myself, wow if 4 times gets me a great color, 14x will have me looking amazing in no time.</li>
      <li>, I just love it - it smells like coconuts!\\&quot;   </li>
      <li>Many people love it, Though the scent tends to stay with you after your done tanning.</li>
      <li>If you, like myself, are not 100% in love with the smell of pears, shop around for another lotion.      </li>
      <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS LOTION.</li>
      <li>and I have to say this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>I will most def.</li>
      <li>Much more than that?  </li>
      <li>I love this lotion.</li>
      <li>The smell is incredible and leaves my skin feeling extremely soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>The scent when first applying is amazing and refreshing, and it has a cooling effect on the skin.</li>
      <li>Black gives you more bronzers but if your looking for a cheaper yet great lotion in camparison I wouldnt buy anything else!</li>
      <li>very quickly using this lotion also.  </li>
      <li>I tan easily (with the help of bronzers of course)...</li>
      <li>Gives skin an incredible healthy glow that other lotions just can&#x27;t seem to do.</li>
      <li>(that is so QEFTSG gay).</li>
      <li>I was amazed when I used a sticker my first time and peeled it off to see a difference!!</li>
      <li>At first, the smell is really nice and even right after you&#x27;re done, it smells fine.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended as I have tried the rest and will stick with the best, the gold standard, 14 Karat Gold that is.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super easy to get off your hands</li>
      <li>ive been getting positive comments on my tan. : ))</li>
      <li>It has a pretty good, soft smell.</li>
      <li>The smell is kind of fruity, and can be a bit overwhelming at times, but overall definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>I used this lotion last year and loved it.  </li>
      <li>Makes you have a nice looking natural tan.  </li>
      <li>I remember last year when i purchased tao, it said it had 4x the bronzer power, which is a good sales pitch.</li>
      <li>The bronzers really work, and my tan doesn&#x27;t seem to fade as easily.</li>
      <li>It lets your real tan shine through and strong.</li>
      <li>This was kind of upsetting, yet 20 bucks is alot better than 70 to waste on a lotion.</li>
      <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
      <li>I am a frequent tanner and have tried most all the high-end lotions</li>
      <li>I was golden brown in no time.</li>
      <li>Great if you want to get dark fast</li>
      <li>Shipper is great it always gets to me within a few days!</li>
      <li>Good dark tan</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so excited for my new bottles to arrive!</li>
      <li>Same size, same product for 50% off - great deal.</li>
      <li>Good lotion for $20 or less.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been tanning for 10 years &amp; this is the only lotion I&#x27;ve bought more than once.</li>
      <li>I love this lotion, but was not about to spend big bucks at the tanning salon on it...</li>
      <li>It gives me a pretty bronze looking tan, &amp; it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes at all.</li>
      <li>At first, I could just smell it on my clothes</li>
      <li>It is a lighter lotion and is absorbed into your skin very quickly, that&#x27;s the only reason why I gave it three stars.</li>
      <li>This is a great lotion to use if you are a frequent tanner and plan on getting very dark, very soon.</li>
      <li>This lotion has served me well, and even though I am still light, I have more color than usual.    </li>
      <li>(was a little greasy though) but got GREAT color even only after 1 use.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>It is very hydrating, feels like a tropical drink on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Eh, not so much.</li>
      <li>The price was unreal and it got to me so fast..</li>
      <li>Saved significant dollars purchasing through Amazon rather than the local tanning salon.</li>
      <li>and it works better than all the other lotions I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>But, I got a free sample of a new product by Australian Gold, its called Creamy Gelato.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>Its like im stuck at a certain color that i have passed many times in the past.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for instant results try using Golden Ceremony.</li>
      <li>THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE DESIGNER SKIN LOTIONS ALONG WITH BLACK!</li>
      <li>Smoothly glides over skin providing even coverage and a deep dark rich natural looking skin tone.  </li>
      <li>Lotion was shipped quickly/brand new.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, all in all this is a pretty solid lotion to rely on.</li>
      <li>It gets my tan the darkest possible without the weird orange tint that so many lotions leave from too many bronzers.  </li>
      <li>It is one of the stronger ones, and will leave you feeling very sticky after your done tanning because it does not seem to dry up much.</li>
      <li>So overall, the lotion is o.k w/its tanning abilities and does leave the skin feeling soft, but the negatives (smell) outweigh any of its positive attributes to me.</li>
      <li>After a while, however, the smell gets old.</li>
      <li>lotion does produce a lovely Goldon color and lasts a long time because a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t know about the long term affect of this lotion seeing as how I only tried it once this afternoon</li>
      <li>They come out with so many different ones each year that its almost impossible to choose which one is right for you.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I like this product because it doesn&#x27;t make you smell like you went tanning.  It&#x27;s super easy to get off your hands and it works better than all the other lotions I&#x27;ve tried.  It makes your tan last for weeks which saves money!!  Three weeks after I stopped tannin, people were still asking about my deep color.  You tan very quickly using this lotion also.  I was amazed when I used a sticker my first time and peeled it off to see a difference!! I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> Im a guy. I tan easily (with the help of bronzers of course)... I have tried alot of different designer skin products. They come out with so many different ones each year that its almost impossible to choose which one is right for you. I remember last year when i purchased tao, it said it had 4x the bronzer power, which is a good sales pitch. Now this year this came out, 14x .... I thought to myself, wow if 4 times gets me a great color, 14x will have me looking amazing in no time. Eh, not so much. Smells like gummy bears, but doesnt seem to get me as tan as id like. Its like im stuck at a certain color that i have passed many times in the past. Now i see there is a 20x one. Of course, i buy into that type of b.s. but we will see. Tao and spellbound got me dark. This was kind of upsetting, yet 20 bucks is alot better than 70 to waste on a lotion.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS LOTION. THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE DESIGNER SKIN LOTIONS ALONG WITH BLACK! Black gives you more bronzers but if your looking for a cheaper yet great lotion in camparison I wouldnt buy anything else! Shipper is great it always gets to me within a few days!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, but was not about to spend big bucks at the tanning salon on it... The price was unreal and it got to me so fast.. Just 2 day and I had it in my hand... Very pleased and I will order again!</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion after reading mixed reviews online. A girl I work with used this lotion this year and her results were incredible... ( but come to find out, she&#x27;s just one of those chicks with the easiest to tan skin); unlike me who is very pale w/light brown hair. I started the tanning season off this year by using \\&quot;Paint it black\\&quot; by Millennium, which got me a descent base tan in about 3 weeks and was quite cheap. I was at the \\&quot;Tanning Plateau\\&quot; with that lotion so I tried 14 karat. First off, The smell is awful, awful to the point when your in the bed you feel nauseous b/c the smell is so overpowering, its like a weird pear smell. I read the review of the bad smell and said ahh.. what the heck I like pears, it wont be that bad. No, it really is that bad. I feel bad to waste a full bottle of lotion or to give it to anyone else and have them endure the awful smell...So overall, the lotion is o.k w/its tanning abilities and does leave the skin feeling soft, but the negatives (smell) outweigh any of its positive attributes to me. So be warned...lol But, I got a free sample of a new product by Australian Gold, its called Creamy Gelato. It freaking rocks! It has a Vaseline gel like consistency w/hardly any scent. It absorbs into the skin so nice and when you get out of the bed you are not greasy nor sweaty. I really don&#x27;t know about the long term affect of this lotion seeing as how I only tried it once this afternoon but I will definitely be buying this one soon. Good Luck to all you, and have a great Summer!</li>
    <li> Excellent lotion which I use daily with indoor tanning.  Smoothly glides over skin providing even coverage and a deep dark rich natural looking skin tone.  Highly recommended as I have tried the rest and will stick with the best, the gold standard, 14 Karat Gold that is.</li>
    <li> the smell was really light and the lotion went on great (was a little greasy though) but got GREAT color even only after 1 use.</li>
    <li> This product has the worst after-smell I have ever smelled. At first, the smell is really nice and even right after you&#x27;re done, it smells fine. It&#x27;s not too dark so it doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes but after it sinks into my skin, it smells really bad. At first, I could just smell it on my clothes and I thought maybe my cat had been peeing on my dirty clothes and on our furniture but come to find out that it was the tanning lotion that was leaving a nauseating smell wherever I sat after tanning. It doesn&#x27;t smell immediately but somehow, after time passes, it smells like Body Odor mixed with Cat urination... not lovely. I didn&#x27;t even use half of my bottle and I will never put it on again.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It gives me a pretty bronze looking tan, &amp; it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes at all. It has a pretty good, soft smell. Everyone is different ofcourse, but it works great on me! I will most def. buy this one again!</li>
    <li> I was somehow talked into buying this lotion at a tanning salon for the \\&quot;bargain\\&quot; (cough, cough) price of $65.  I asked the sales person to describe to smell for me, as I was a little sick &amp; could not smell it.    \\&quot;Oh, I just love it - it smells like coconuts!\\&quot;   Hmm...  Well?  Since I&#x27;m stuck in Seattle in the winter, I might as well smell like I&#x27;m on vacation.  Why not?  I am a fair-to-light skinned person, and do not expect miracles.  This lotion has served me well, and even though I am still light, I have more color than usual.    However.    Do not be fooled...  This lotion smells like PEARS.  If you, like myself, are not 100% in love with the smell of pears, shop around for another lotion.      And as another reviewer mentioned, you get sort of a burnt toast/ nasty pear/ DHA after scent when you&#x27;re done.    Bottom line?  Good lotion for $20 or less.  Much more than that?  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I tried this product a couple of time in the salon. It is a lighter lotion and is absorbed into your skin very quickly, that&#x27;s the only reason why I gave it three stars. I hate the smell of the product. It&#x27;s very strong and I don&#x27;t like smelling like pears. Also, everytime I used this product I left the salon red and slightly burned. If you are looking for instant results try using Golden Ceremony.</li>
    <li> I am a frequent tanner and have tried most all the high-end lotions and I have to say this is my favorite. The smell is incredible and leaves my skin feeling extremely soft and smooth. It gets my tan the darkest possible without the weird orange tint that so many lotions leave from too many bronzers.  It lets your real tan shine through and strong. Gives skin an incredible healthy glow that other lotions just can&#x27;t seem to do.</li>
    <li> This lotion in my opinion, smells quite yummy. Many people love it, Though the scent tends to stay with you after your done tanning. It is one of the stronger ones, and will leave you feeling very sticky after your done tanning because it does not seem to dry up much. It is very hydrating, feels like a tropical drink on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion does produce a lovely Goldon color and lasts a long time because a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Its not my favorite Designer Skin product but definetly not the worst.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for 10 years &amp; this is the only lotion I&#x27;ve bought more than once. I&#x27;ve made everyone I know try it &amp; they love it! Great if you want to get dark fast</li>
    <li> Purchased this lotion a couple of months ago and have used about half the product.  Did I say product? (that is so QEFTSG gay). I meant half the bottle.  Good dark tan however, a somewhat pleasant smell although the smell can be considered a strong after tan odor by some.  Saved significant dollars purchasing through Amazon rather than the local tanning salon.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome tanning lotion. I was golden brown in no time. I would recommend it to every one.</li>
    <li> I had priced this lotion at my local tanning salon. Same size, same product for 50% off - great deal.</li>
    <li> This is a good tanning lotion. The smell is kind of fruity, and can be a bit overwhelming at times, but overall definitely worth it. This sells at salons for $60 to $80, and $35 to $40 on other online websites, so buying it here provides a dramatic savings.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awsome. Got me dark in acouple of tans. Will but it again.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion to use if you are a frequent tanner and plan on getting very dark, very soon. The scent when first applying is amazing and refreshing, and it has a cooling effect on the skin. After tanning, it takes on a stronger, somewhat burnt odor.. resembling toasted almonds? Anyway, all in all this is a pretty solid lotion to rely on.</li>
    <li> Roar is better if you can handle a tingle! Otherwise this is actually a good lotion. It gives you good color and has a fruity smell. After a while, however, the smell gets old. I&#x27;m so excited for my new bottles to arrive!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites. I have tried a lot of tanning lotions and this one is really good. It has a candy banana smell to it, and it doesn&#x27;t have that terrible after tan smell. You can go on with your day and not rush home to shower and wash it off.</li>
    <li> Lotion was shipped quickly/brand new.  Makes you have a nice looking natural tan.  Highly recommend.  Would do business again... ive been getting positive comments on my tan. : ))</li>
    <li> This product is one of the best tanning lotions I have.It smells good so thats a plus.It&#x27;s an excellent tanning lotion , and the second best of the designer brand!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I used this lotion last year and loved it.  Had some left over in the bottle this year, and it still works.  Unlike alot of tanning bed products, the scent of 14 Karat Gold is nice...even had the tanning bed operator ask what I was using because she thot it smelled good in the room when I finished (lol).  I will continue to use this lotion and have ordered another.  The bronzers really work, and my tan doesn&#x27;t seem to fade as easily. I highly recommend it! Well worth the cost.</li>
</ol>
