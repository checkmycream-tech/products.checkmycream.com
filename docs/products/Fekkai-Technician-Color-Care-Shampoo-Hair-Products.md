      <li>JUST LOVE THE PRODUCT AND IS MUCH CHEAPER ON LINE!</li>
      <li>My hair is clean after use.</li>
      <li>Shampoo smelled fruity &amp; fresh, lathered up &amp; rinsed easily.</li>
      <li>or if I have a special occasion coming up</li>
      <li>Watch what you&#x27;re buying, just because it smells nice and makes your hair soft</li>
      <li>This product, along with the conditioner is wonderful for my thick hair.  </li>
      <li>For me this used to be an easy 5 star product; I&#x27;d had great results with this pair for years but over the past year</li>
      <li>and I was so happy to get it at half price.</li>
      <li>, you really do get what you pay for; and so far I love the results!</li>
      <li>The shampoo  is so light, but very cleansing.</li>
      <li>where I really want my hair to be fabulous.</li>
      <li>As a BzzAgent, I received a complimentary bottle of this shampoo to review.  </li>
      <li>I have wavy hair that tends to frizz and go wild, but with Fekkai my hair is moisturized and more sleek.    </li>
      <li>My hair feels so soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>Not 100% sure it&#x27;s worth it, although I do think it is milder on my hair than other more detergenty types of shampoos that are out there.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair feeling soft and very clean.  </li>
      <li>Conditioner smelled like a pina colda &amp; left hair smooth &amp; tangle free.</li>
      <li>I have to say this shampoo does leave my hair more healthy than the Dove I&#x27;ve been using for the past 4 months-</li>
      <li>Like my  Dad always said \\&quot;It doesn&#x27;t cost anymore to go first class</li>
      <li>This is far superior to that and any other shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo and conditioner both rinse out quickly and easily which has cut down on my shower time.</li>
      <li>I am very please with Fekkai Technician color care Shampoo.</li>
      <li>(I don&#x27;t much care for the smell in the bottle but after using the shampoo and conditioner my hair smelled wonderful)and</li>
      <li>It lathers really, really well</li>
      <li>The finish was the very lucious mask.  </li>
      <li>This is a very pleasant-smelling (think tropical cocktail) moisturizing shampoo.</li>
      <li>delivery was fast.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t see what all the hype is about.</li>
      <li>Since the price was reasonable</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s so much easier to style.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t strip my haircolor and is very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Conditioner: I really like the consistency of the Fekkai conditioner.</li>
      <li>It has left my hair feeling more soft and manageable in just a couple weeks of use.  </li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s good for you.  </li>
      <li>I live in a hot weather state.  </li>

    <li> Fekkai Technician Color Care shampoo and conditioner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I am a Bzz agent, I was fortunate to receive free bottles of the Fekkai Technician Color Care shampoo and conditioner for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wavy to curly, color-treated hair that is thick and somewhat coarse. Both the Fekkai shampoo and conditioner have a wonderful scent that is neither overwhelming nor artificial-smelling.The result of using both products, even after one use, was shiny, soft bouncy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I used the Fekkai color-care products longer, my hair became more manageable and shinier.I think the color protection is excellent as well. I have colored only my roots for the past 2 months, and the color on my hair length has stayed dark and rich- no brassiness that occurs when dark brown dye fades too much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love these products and may replace my beloved Nexxus, which I have used for over a decade, with the Fekkai items. I would like to try the Shea Butter line next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo: Cleans well, but I noticed it left the ends of my hair little rough and tangled after rinsing. The conditioner took care of that, however.I did not see any color washing out in the suds or rinse water, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner: I really like the consistency of the Fekkai conditioner. It is not too thin and spreads easily through my hair. I do not need much, and I do not have to leave it in very long for it to detangle and smooth my hair. I have to leave other conditioners on my hair for an hour, but the Fekkai conditioner does its magic in a few minutes. I leave it on for about 20, but I doubt that is necessary.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo for color treated hair</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo before from a Sample pack I received.  After, getting my hair color treated, I decided to purchase the 8oz (was at a great price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is awesome:  Smells great, feels ultra soft &amp; clean, and I know it will lessen any fading (I have the infamous Red hair color in my hair &#x3D; that tends to fade faster).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know with this product, I will not have to wash my hair daily.  One the 2nd day it will still feel clean as the first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone w/color treated &amp; fine hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars!</li>
    <li> i am a bzzagent and recieved this product in the mail. i like this smell of this product.. it made my hair looks and it feels so great. ive got compliments on my hair.. this is by far the best shampoo/conditioner combo i have ever used. i just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing! I have tons of long, fine, highlighted hair with a slight wave to it and some pieces that curl in annoying ways (cowlicks). It is very hard to find a conditioner that leaves my hair soft but not flat - I usually have to choose between dry hair with some body or soft hair that looks like it needs to be washed again a few hours later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair smells great after I use it (I don&#x27;t much care for the smell in the bottle but after using the shampoo and conditioner my hair smelled wonderful)and it&#x27;s so much easier to style. The shampoo and conditioner both rinse out quickly and easily which has cut down on my shower time. I normally only buy shampoo that can be found at a big box store like Target, but I fell in love with this after trying the travel size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended it to friends and will continue to use it. I haven&#x27;t had a bad hair day since I tried this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> I am a BZZ Agent and received the shampoo and conditioner to try and review.  This has a wonderful scent and is exhilarating in the morning to smell the grapefruit scent.  i have very thick hair with a wave underneath and highlighted.  I live in a hot weather state.  This shampoo and conditioner really leaves my hair very soft and manageable.  Even the next morning, 24 hours later, my hair feels soft and silky.</li>
    <li> I Love Fredric Fekkai&#x27;s hair care products. The shampoo  is so light, but very cleansing. Every chance I get to buy it because it is rather expensive I will. Like my  Dad always said \\&quot;It doesn&#x27;t cost anymore to go first class, you just cannot go as often.\\&quot;  Try this product you will love it. [[ASIN:B000R8WOT0 Frederic Fekkai Technician Color Care Shampoo 16 oz (475 ml)]]</li>
    <li> This line works great, smells great, feels great...etc. But it&#x27;s really expensive. Not 100% sure it&#x27;s worth it, although I do think it is milder on my hair than other more detergenty types of shampoos that are out there. My color isn&#x27;t really that light sensitive or covering anything; just making my hair a little darker and richer, so not sure if it&#x27;s worth it to me to continue spending the $ on this.</li>
    <li> I use to use kerastase and this stuff by far BEATS it! Fekkai shampoo and conditioner is amazing. My hair feels so soft and healthy. Will forever use this stuff.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of wavy hair that I have colored on a regular basis.  Most shampoos weigh my hair down and take the &amp;#34;bounce&amp;#34; out of the waves -- not to mention fading the color.  I find this shampoo to be light enough to allow my waves to wave and gentle enough not to fade my color.  I have been using it for over a year and don&#x27;t intend to change.</li>
    <li> I received the Fekkai Technician Color Care Shampoo and Conditioner to try as a BzzAgent, and I am very pleased with the results. I color my hair red, which is a hard color to keep, and I think the Fekkai products do a good job of preserving the color. I also noticed that my hair was very manageable, not weighed down or flyaway. The shampoo and conditioner have a citrus scent and feel light when applied. I have very fine hair as well, and I had body without too many tangles when using this system. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give a 5 star rating is the price. My bottles are almost empty but I haven&#x27;t purchased more because I am reluctant to buy at the $18 dollar per bottle cost. Although I really like the products I have other color care products that do ~almost~ as good a job for less than half the price. I can see me purchasing these in the future if I begin having problems with my hair or if I have a special occasion coming up where I really want my hair to be fabulous.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m curious how this can be labeled for colored hair when the first ingredient is Sodium Laureth Sulfate. Sulfates are well known to strip color from hair. Loreal does the same thing, only the sulfate they use has a different name. What ever happened to truth in advertising?</li>
    <li> I am very please with Fekkai Technician color care Shampoo. I recommend this product because it take care of the color giving a lighter tone and you never lose a hair.  This is the second time I purchase this product.  Gloria O of New York</li>
    <li> I have color-treated hair and used to use Redken Blonde Glam. This is far superior to that and any other shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.  I base a quality shampoo and conditioner on whether I can tell a difference in the feel/look of my hair after I style it, plus of course how well it helps retain my color. Fekkai Technician Color Care Shampoo (best combined with the conditioner) significantly improves the look of my hair, making it look more shiny and polished. My color honestly fades very little if any. The price on Amazon also cannot be beat.</li>
    <li> My husband was very happy with this purchase. Has sensitive skin, but wants a close shave and this does the job.</li>
    <li> This is great shampoo, will order more soon.</li>
    <li> As a BzzAgent, I received a complimentary bottle of this shampoo to review.  I think Fekkai Technician Color Care Shampoo is great! It has left my hair feeling more soft and manageable in just a couple weeks of use.  Also, my highlights are more vibrant and seem to have much more shine- the only drawback to this is I have noticed my neglected roots more :D  I have wavy hair that tends to frizz and go wild, but with Fekkai my hair is moisturized and more sleek.    The reason I gave only 4 stars, compared to 5 is that the shampoo is quite pricey, especially if you want BOTH the shampoo and conditioner.... I have to say this shampoo does leave my hair more healthy than the Dove I&#x27;ve been using for the past 4 months- I guess I&#x27;ll just have to suck it up, you really do get what you pay for; and so far I love the results!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t see what all the hype is about. No better than shampoos that cost less.</li>
    <li> This shampoo fits with my hair. I have wavy and colored hair and it turned my waxy hair into nice relaxed curls. I would have given this 5 stars, but because of the price I gave it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I loved this Shampoo when I first started using it.  Fekkai products smell better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, but the longer I used them, the drier and more damaged my hair became.  This just isn&#x27;t a good choice for colored hair.  If you&#x27;re looking for shampoos and conditioners that work well and smell great, I&#x27;ve had much better luck with Alterna.  I switched a couple month ago and my hair feels incredibly healthy now!</li>
    <li> yes, this is expensive, but it is very concentrated and luxuriant.  You will use a small amount.  Cleanses great without stripping.</li>
    <li> you sent us the wrong product, we did not receive what you told me the fekkai technician color care shampoo, what we received was something similar but not the same, is advanced fekkai technician shampoo that is another formula, please check it and send us an answer</li>
    <li> shampoo is great. delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> Great product. Maybe the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t strip my haircolor and is very moisturizing. I use it along with the matching conditioner. Highly recommend and would definitely re-order!!</li>
    <li> Lovely product. Ive used it for a long time. Expect to contiue to do so.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! My hair feels silky, smooth and looks wonderful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Fekkai products for a long time. They are always very good. This one is not different. Excellent.</li>
    <li> I am a bzzagent and had the opportunity to try Fekkai Technician Color Care for myself.  I have highlighted hair and need a shampoo that works on colored hair. Fekkai&#x27;s shampoo is very good. I think it compares to the more expensive brands sold at salons.  I fine the fragrance to be pleasant. My hair is clean after use. It does not leave my hair feeling dry and my hair is easy to comb through- other products have left my hair in tangles.  Overall, this is a very good shampoo for color treated or highlighted hair.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately that includes this shampoo and conditioner. For me this used to be an easy 5 star product; I&#x27;d had great results with this pair for years but over the past year or so I think they may have changed the formula. Still smells great but I noticed that I wasn&#x27;t getting the same fabulous results that I&#x27;d had in the past. I compared what was left in my old bottle and the new and there was definitely *something* different. Giving benefit of the doubt, I decided to assume it was that my old product was, well.... old. Tried giving my hair a break from the brand, tried buying from a different source, still not the same.  Too expensive to keep trying so I&#x27;ve had to move on to a different product.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for colored hair.  Helps keep the color fresh and last longer.</li>
    <li> Watch what you&#x27;re buying, just because it smells nice and makes your hair soft doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s good for you.  The sulfate in it is what you use for a floor cleaner or your garage not your hair!  I dye my hair once a month, having something with sulfate eats my hair up. You as a customer deserve better than that!  When you buy your next shampoo and conditioner look at what you&#x27;re buying in the ingredients.  I am returning all of my fekkai products for something with better quality like living proof or NEVO.</li>
    <li> This product, along with the conditioner is wonderful for my thick hair.  It leaves it feeling silky which is not usual for me, and it is gentle on my scalp, not drying.</li>
    <li> This is such a Great price!!!This is my favorite shampoo and I was so happy to get it at half price.</li>
    <li> This is a very pleasant-smelling (think tropical cocktail) moisturizing shampoo. However, it does not add volume and you should probably wash twice if your hair has any detectable oil that you want to wash away.</li>
    <li> this protects the dyed hair a lot and i can say cuz i have been using this shampoo for quite a long time and i can vouch the color lasts a bit longer than when other shampoos are used....</li>
    <li> Since the price was reasonable I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. So far it&#x27;s worked great. I will order it again.</li>
    <li> JUST LOVE THE PRODUCT AND IS MUCH CHEAPER ON LINE! I CAN BUY 2 FOR THE ORICE ON LINE. IT&#x27;S ALL ABOUT SAVING MONEY.</li>
    <li> This was a nice change for shampoo for me.  It smells wonderful and I really am enjoying it.</li>
    <li> Item came in as promised and was as described</li>
    <li> Received complimentary samples of Fekkai Technician Color Care Shampoo, Conditioner &amp; Luxe Color Mask &amp; thoroughly enjoyed all these amazing products. Shampoo smelled fruity &amp; fresh, lathered up &amp; rinsed easily. Conditioner smelled like a pina colda &amp; left hair smooth &amp; tangle free. The finish was the very lucious mask.  My hair is Fekkai Fabulous,  my color is glossy &amp; looks just done at  the salon. What a fabulous product, thank you Fekkai!</li>
    <li> love this product for my color treated hair</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the best thing that has happened to my dry, colored hair.  I never thought that my hair would be so touchable ever again.  Even when I have my hair done at the salon are they able to get the results that I have from this shampoo.  My salon now keeps this shampoo on hand for me because I was bringing it with me for my wash.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this shampoo to anyone that has fine/delicate/colored hair. Great shampoo that not only helps keep your colored hair vibrant longer, but isn&#x27;t heavy, giving hair extra body. Very pleasent scent, not to perfumey, and great for all types of hair.</li>
    <li> I tried this shampoo, and also the conditioner, on my color treated hair and could see absolutely no difference in color loss. I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I definitely recommend this shampoo.  It lathers really, really well and you don&#x27;t even need to use a lot.  Leaves my hair feeling soft and very clean.  Plus, it smells good.  The conditioner is great too.</li>
