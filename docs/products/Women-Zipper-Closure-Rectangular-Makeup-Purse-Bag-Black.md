      <li>I keep my makeup in this and it is really worth it</li>
      <li>It was just the right size.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Loved it!! Great buy!!</li>
    <li> I like this bag for it&#x27;s size, style, and function but I wish it was better quality material.  It just seems somewhat flimsy, but overall, I would buy it again because it serves it&#x27;s purpose well and is convenient to move from one purse to another.</li>
    <li> The quality is good but the actual measurements were smaller than advertised. My money was refunded without any issue from the seller.</li>
    <li> This is a good make up bag.  I know some people said it was cheap looking or flimsy but I didn&#x27;t think so for the price it&#x27;s good and it does the job!</li>
    <li> just as pictured, strong, good zipper, perfect for keeping makeup or w.e seperate in your purse</li>
    <li> Use it everyday. I love it</li>
    <li> It was just the right size. However the thread started coming out the first day mulit. place daily I only had it a week. It trash now a waiting so long for it be delivered to only have 1 week of usage..</li>
    <li> when I recieved the bag it was dirty and look like it was used... I wont.be buying again very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The cosmetic bag is nice, just a little small. I wish the bag&lt;br /&gt;came in other colors.</li>
    <li> Delivery&#x3D;awesome. Shipping cost $13 though. Thought this would be a bigger travel size makeup bag. Cheap fabric tore open the day I received it, or perhaps it was shipped that way. I also ordered a Lily Pulitzer bag same day thinking it would be smaller than this one, I got it sooner, it&#x27;s bigger and way cuter with amazing quality for ONLY $3. I strongly recommend Ulta.com for travel sized makeup bags. This bag is cheap and a waste of money unless you&#x27;d like to store iPhone accessories in there. :)</li>
    <li> For this price I was surprised at there being enough room for all my makeup and brushes.  The basic black color is wonderfully understated so I can, sometimes, leave it on the bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> Poor quality, but you get what you pay for. Thin plastic lining crinkles. Zipper came off after a couple of weeks of use. Bag is a bit large--not for carrying around.</li>
    <li> It bigger then what i thought which is really good. It cute and im happy with it. I like everything in my purse to have a place and this prefect.</li>
    <li> This GREAT bag exceeded my expectations by a mile. I have looked all over for a bag like this, in every type of store, and they were either not what I was looking for or cost a million bucks. So I googled black quilted cosmetic bag and came up with this. I wanted a largish cosmetic bag to go in my new extra large Kate Spade tote but did not want to spend Kate Spade prices. This is just the ticket. The material is quilted nylon. The zipper is high quality, and the size is perfect...and maybe best of all, the price is right! The inside is plastic with some small pockets and even a tiny mirror, and is obviously designed for holding cosmetics. This is the LARGE size. So pay attention to the measurements, because some might find it too large. I want to get one in the smaller size too for my other smaller handbags. It ships to you free right from China, (even to Hawaii) so maybe that&#x27;s why they can keep the price down. I can&#x27;t recommend this great find highly enough. This is why we love Amazon!!! Five stars!!</li>
    <li> I have no complaints with this bag, although having a zipper with better quality would make it better, i fit so many things in this small &amp;#34;to-go&amp;#34; bag it&#x27;s completely satisfying.</li>
    <li> This got a hole in it within a week. Some of my makeup fell out of it. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> Bag itself is durable. Not a bad size. However, the zipper just snapped off. I would not recommend it just because of how poorly the zipper was made.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my bridesmaids.  They took awhile to arrive but they told you that it would! These are a great size for normal makeup wearers.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite makeup bag.  I use it all the time.  It has a small mirror in it and inside compartments for my keys and my artificial sweetener.  Plenty of room for a pen and a pad of post-its, as well as a packet of tissues.  The color goes with everything.</li>
    <li> This is a really big make up bag. I was going to use it for my sons medicine and epipen but it is so big and takes up to much room in my purse. Not worth spending the return fee so will use it for my make up and look for a smaller one.</li>
    <li> Arrived a lot faster than expected, and looks great.  I ordered 2 of them so that I could have one for my cosmetics drawer, and one for my bag.  Keeps my powders and brushes clean and neat, and has plenty of room for the things that I need.  Good quality bags.</li>
    <li> I bought these and added iron on letters to make personalized bridesmaid makeup bags. They were great quality. These looked much better than store bought ones and were less than half price. It took a while to get them but it was worth the wait!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this...and I did until it started falling apart, again, this the second one that I got, and I got what I paid for</li>
    <li> Will be put to great use. Thanks for the prompt shipping.</li>
    <li> i tought is was a small bag but is  big have not use it yet&lt;br /&gt;its pretty&lt;br /&gt;I would recomend it</li>
    <li> the bag ripped in a just a few weeks. I wasn&#x27;t rough on it.  I kept it inside my purse at all times. Would NOT recommend.</li>
    <li> I love it, it&#x27;s big and fits a lot of my make up. I recommended it, okay bye now .</li>
    <li> Hold all my makeup. Great for the price.</li>
    <li> It was great while it lasted. only about 3 months then the zipper broke.</li>
    <li> Good quality item. If you are used to carrying big bags then this is a must have to keep your stuff organized. This is not just for make up, you can also keep small items like your back up battery and iphone accessories in it. It has pockets in it that makes organizing real easy. I highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of makeup and I hate when it gets down in my purse, this makeup bag is wonderful.! It fits in my purses and it comes with its own attached mirror. It came undamaged and the stitching through the bag was good, no nicks or loose strings. Plus black goes with just about anything.</li>
    <li> Save your money very cheap zipper tore the first day I received it. Save your money</li>
    <li> CUTE CUTE bag!!  Wanted something nice and simple for my toiletries.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> It serves the purpose nicely - I thought it would be larger but actually a perfect size to fit in most purses.</li>
    <li> My daughter use it all the time, she takes her make up bag everywhere I mean EVERYWHERE and still holding on.</li>
    <li> Perfect product with very quick delivery! Its the perfect size for all my make up and fits perfectly In my new purse I recieved as well!!</li>
    <li> The bag smells terrible!!!! Threw it away. I even aired it out for a week outside and it still smelled funky.</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;ve yet to encounter any foul smell or structural deficiencies, the proportions in the description state it&#x27;s 9.8\\&quot; wide x 2.2\\&quot; thick x 6.7\\&quot; tall. In reality it is 6.7\\&quot; wide x 5\\&quot; tall x 2\\&quot; thick unfolded...that&#x27;s it, way too small for the use I had in mind. It&#x27;s a small makeup bag or larger bag for eyeglasses plus a hard-pack of smokes, if ur into such things. It has clear plastic pockets and a little attached mirror inside. While returning it would be too big a PITA, [China], I&#x27;ll re-purpose it. All-n-all, if I&#x27;d gotten accurate dimensions, I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it. Two stars for erroneous size information.</li>
    <li> Firstly, I have to say the delivery was fast and prompt. I think the seller needs to market this as a unisex make up bag and toiletry bag when it is the black color because I can use it for both. I am a man who uses light makeup every now and again and this product definitely fits my needs. It has enough space for my concealer, powder makeup, multiple eye liners and mascaras and also a facial hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase and very happy with it. Recommended for light make up</li>
    <li> I still use it for my makeup till this day. I have never had a problem! Very excellent quality. Holds a lot of makeup. At least all the makeup I use. Very happy!</li>
    <li> The fabric is very soft, meaning that I can squish it into various places inside my purse which is great because I tend to cary a lot of things with me - I cannot get over how soft it is. The bag is very cute, I love the inside, and it definetly exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> these are not cheaply made even though the price was amazing</li>
    <li> Very nice quilt material. Easy to wash and reuse.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup bag. It&#x27;s neither too big nor too small. It is perfect to put in my purse for quick makeup fixes on the go. And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I love this bag has mirror and zipper compartment:</li>
    <li> I found this to  be a good make-up bag, it fits in my purse and easy to carry. Glad I found this one.</li>
    <li> Spacious and has a bunch of compartments. Its exactly what I wanted and comfortably holds all my makeup! :) Thanks</li>
    <li> I was surprised that it had a pocket on the inside included with a tiny mirror. I use this all the time now.</li>
    <li> Really big; I can&#x27;t use it in my purse like i originally planned but I can use it as my carry around make up bag for traveling.</li>
    <li> The worst. Took forever getting here , but that&#x27;s not my main issue.    It started falling apart literally days after i started using it for make up only, and the the zipper broke as well.    So many reviews loving this product: I am supper confused. Did i get a different quality product?    I guess you get what you pay for...the cost was cheap, and the item is cheap..</li>
    <li> I bought this for my cosmetics and the inside pocket was plastic and flimsy and tore within minutes. Otherwise its a decent bag if you want something cheap the looks decent.</li>
    <li> This bag is great for traveling since you can squish it down a lot more. It also doesn&#x27;t show any make up spills and has nice size pockets inside.</li>
    <li> this was for a Christmas present for my grandaughter. It got here too late adn she won&#x27;t be able to come back for some time yet so will be unable to use it. It was somehting she needed. It doe&#x27;s look nice.The little plastic mirror inside was broken when it arrived. It wasn&#x27;t protected at all and came from China.</li>
    <li> i got my package just the other day and was thried to see the sized of it and it had a little mirrors the matrial was nice and it was made perfect into my eye i put my makeup there my makeup in there i and it durable for me pluse did i say its wonderful buy it it a must like when your on your trips ,works,shoping,parting, what ever women desire to put there things on just enjoy ok</li>
    <li> Mirror broke after 1 weeks use! But other than that bag is still going strong!</li>
    <li> i do not know there are 3 products! but i like them because of the quality. and the black color can prevent the product from the dust.</li>
    <li> Zipper fell off in 5 days</li>
    <li> Always replacing my makeup bags and after reading reviews I decided to order .This is better than expected the quality is great ,holds many of my cosmetics and has a mirror attached inside I got the black color this fits perfect in my purse and the zipper works well also very easy to clean with a damp cloth.Seller was great arrived sooner than estimated about two weeks and the price was right !Next I want to order the Red one.</li>
    <li> I like the product and mirror is great! I would recommend to others. Can&#x27;t wait to see how much I can fit in it...</li>
    <li> Very nice makeup bag, everything I need perfectly fits there. It ships from Hong Kong and it takes a while to get it, so place your order ahead</li>
    <li> Bought this bag in different colors in order to distinguish items packed inside. Have used the smaller version of this bag every day but have not needed this one yet. Very sturdy yet not bulky. Strong easy open zipper with handy mirror.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup bag.  I just started using mineral makeup and this fits the jars as well as the brushes.  It&#x27;s also easy to clean.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute and fits everything I need when I&#x27;m on the go, :) they should definitely expand and sell bigger cosmetic bags I would definitely buy :)</li>
    <li> the inside has 2 plastic pockets that are so cheap, it makes a crinkle sound.  The cheap zipper broke off the first day.</li>
    <li> Tears up in the inside pocket. It tore up after one week of having it.</li>
    <li> Nice design and good material</li>
    <li> Super cute, arrived on time and just as shown as picture. Used these for my bridesmaids and they loved them. Was able to hold make and other things.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t find a better makeup bag for this price.  It is well made and has an elegant style.  The wait to get it took a while but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> MUCH TOO BIG FOR A MAKE-UP BAG....ONLY FITS IN LARGE POCKETBOOK..DIDNT LIKE THE MATERIAL IT WAS MADE OF!</li>
    <li> I keep my makeup in this and it is really worth it everything fits. BUY it</li>
    <li> I love the makeup purse! It&#x27;s large enough to hold all my products, however, after a few uses the zipper has broken.</li>
    <li> This bag is perfect for me.  I was almost tempted to buy a similar bag at Nordstrom for 3 times the amount.  I&#x27;m so glad I found this one instead!</li>
    <li> until the zipper comes off and then it&#x27;s useless. This happened right after the return window closed. I really liked the product until the zipper came off. It is nice sized and fit all of my make up items with lots of room left.</li>
    <li> The bag is a decent size, but the zipper broke and the bag frayed in less than a month. Was not a good buy.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice looking and nice quality makeup bag. I will only ever buy black makeup bags because they hide makeup spills the best. The only thing I would caution with this bag is its size. I didn’t read the dimensions, and it’s actually quite large (I have an evening clutch the same size). So if you don’t have a ton of makeup or have a small purse, I’d be careful ordering this, otherwise it’s perfect!</li>
    <li> I returned my bag because when I got it the zipper was already split.  It is very cheap quality and it smells really bad.  I did like the size of it. It is better to pay a little more and get a better quality bag.</li>
    <li> There was nothing really wrong with it.. Not very thick material but I liked it because I am using it as a makeup bag. And easy to clean. I&#x27;m happy with it :)</li>
    <li> cheap cheap cheap. cheap zipper. cheap material. material frays and gets stuck in the zipper. wouldn&#x27;t buy this again</li>
    <li> good for smaller makeup bag items but overall too small for me</li>
    <li> This is just what I needed, I have been looking for a product like this for the longest. It fits my beauty products very well in my handbag, my bag is no longer disorganized.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use for my lotions (tanning lotions and regular lotions) for when I need to take them with me. Its very large and great! I would recommend it to others!</li>
