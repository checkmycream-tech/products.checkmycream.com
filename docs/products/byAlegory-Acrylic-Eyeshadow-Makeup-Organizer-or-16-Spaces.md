<li> Wet n Wild color icon Shadow single, and *e.l.f.</li>

<li> Long -Lasting Lustrous Eyeshadow single.</li>
<li> Here&#x27;s a list of brands I keep in it for other people who might have the same concerns I did: Ulta, Urban Decay, Laura Geller, NYX, MAC.</li>
<li> L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al HiP Studio Secrets shadow duos, *L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al 24 HR Infallible cream shadow single,</li>
<li> It matches only small eyeshadows like Mac it could have been little bigger</li>

<li> Item arrived chipped on one corner and cracked on the other side.</li>
<li> The picture shows round slots but is actually small squares that not large enough for the Mac shadow cases that I purchased it for.</li>
<li> so the little eyeshadow containers would fall over.</li>
<li> The pockets were too small to put in Mac eyeshadows</li>
<li> It was a small crack on the bottom</li>
<li> No more stacks of compacts all over my vanity!</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s not to bad.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <li> Perfect for Mac prolongwear eye shadows, mineralize eye shadows and pressed pigments. The slots are too big for the regular size shadows.</li>
    <li> They are perfect, il buy more!</li>
    <li> It matches only small eyeshadows like Mac it could have been little bigger</li>
    <li> The acrylic material is strong and sturdy. This can hold my singular, eyeshadow containers (MAC). But it can also hold some of my blush compacts too. It would be nice if it could hold my foundation compacts as well. If they made the slots wider, it would be versatile enough to hold multiple widths, but not too wide so the little eyeshadow containers would fall over.</li>
    <li> Item arrived chipped on one corner and cracked on the other side. Very disappointed. Second issue I have had with Planet Beauty products.</li>
    <li> The pockets were too small to put in Mac eyeshadows</li>
    <li> great for round eydshadows</li>
    <li> Great organizer. Perfect for colourpop eyeshadows!</li>
    <li> Questions above makes no sense but the organizer works great.  Works so good I am buying another one.</li>
    <li> Great concept. Mine came cracked but I didn&#x27;t notice it until a few weeks later when I inspected it more. It was a small crack on the bottom so it&#x27;s not to bad. Made of pretty heavy duty plastic, good construction.</li>
    <li> This organizer is a good length and has a decent amount of wells, but it should take into account the varying sizes of products per brand out there and accommodate a variety of package widths.</li>
    <li> Fits all of my sml eyeshadows such as colour pop</li>
    <li> Great project.  It&#x27;s well made and durable.  Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice but bigger than I expected. Pic looks like it holds MAC eyeshadow but they actually slide side to side and don&#x27;t line up.</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow organizer is amazing.. Planing on purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> awesome, it fits most of my shadows but the only down side is it does not fit my &amp;#34;Jessie&#x27;s Girl&amp;#34; shadows and my &amp;#34;Coulorpop&amp;#34; shadows. But overall I am very happy!</li>
    <li> Love it love it love it</li>
    <li> This product delivered in a timely manner and good packaging. It was in perfect condition. I really like the quality and size.

    <li> These are perfect for eye shadow storage. I got clear but I love the variety of colors. When it comes to organizing and storing makeup byAlgory&#x27;s product&#x27;s never disappointed me. I have since bought 2 more.....yes) I have a lot of single shadows) and the paint pot storage container that also works great for eyeliners.</li>
    <li> The picture shows round slots but is actually small squares that not large enough for the Mac shadow cases that I purchased it for.</li>
    <li> These are amazing shadow holders. I use them for my Milani, L&#x27;Oreal, MAC and Colour Pop eyeshadows. Each shadow sits differently inside the little square, but they fit securely. The set is very attractive on my bathroom counter, and they&#x27;re very sturdy.</li>
    <li> This review is for the organizer and not for the color, product applied during the day.  These are nice, thick and sturdy organizers.  I use them in my bathroom vanity and they fit all my makeup products nicely.</li>
    <li> FITS *L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al Wear Infinit&amp;eacute; Studio Secrets shadow singles, *L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al HiP Studio Secrets shadow duos, *L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al 24 HR Infallible cream shadow single, *Wet n Wild color icon Shadow single, and *e.l.f. Long -Lasting Lustrous Eyeshadow single. DOESN&#x27;T FIT *Maybelline Expert Wear Stylish Smokes (except on its side), *Maybelline 24 HR Color Tattoo Metal cream shadow singles,  *Almay intense i-color shadow trios, or *Cover Girl shadow trios or quads. A Cover Girl Checkers single blush will only fit on its side.</li>
    <li> The pictures were deceiving.  The pictures clearly show MAC eyeshadow fitting perfectly.  However, they must be the larger MAC shadows, not the standard MAC shadows.  So the slots are too big for the standard MAC shadows but they fit my larger MAC shadows perfectly.  Unfortunately, I bought it for the standard MAC shadows which I have the most of.</li>
    <li> These are by far the absolute best acrylic makeup holders I have ever seen. They&#x27;re very thick and sturdy, and do not feel cheaply made at all!!</li>
    <li> This organizer works great for all my Bare Minerals eye shadows. Each one fits in its own little cubby hole and it is so easy and convenient to be able to see all the colors at a glance. I love it!</li>
    <li> Perfect organizer! I was concerned that some of my compacts wouldn&#x27;t fit since there&#x27;s such a variety of sizes, but they all sit in the little compartments just fine. No more stacks of compacts all over my vanity! Here&#x27;s a list of brands I keep in it for other people who might have the same concerns I did: Ulta, Urban Decay, Laura Geller, NYX, MAC.</li>
    <li> Fits well in my vanity and keeps me very organized</li>
    <li> I love this organizer. I have recently been trying to find organizers for all of my makeup. This fits all of my eyeshadow perfectly. I have this sitting in one of my drawers and I can easily see the last eyeshadow. I like it because I don&#x27;t have to lift each eyeshadow to search for a particular eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> This organizer is great and fits a large assortment of the single eyeshadows I have.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t fit my Maybelline Color Tattoos or any glass pot like a paintpot or gel eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Great quality, perfect fit!</li>
