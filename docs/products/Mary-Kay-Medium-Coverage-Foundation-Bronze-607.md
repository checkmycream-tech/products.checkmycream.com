<li> I thought twice about sending it back, but I was in desperate need of foundation.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts or noticed anything wrong with it since using it which is why it still gets 3 out of 5 stars.</li>
<li> I was skeptical but would order again.</li>
<li> I was a bit disappointed that the Mary Kay foundation had expired.</li>

    <li> For a inexpensive foundation it gets the job done for me and I love that😃</li>
    <li> This Mary Kay concealer is great.  I received a bunch of Mary Kay products as a gift and have enjoyed trying them out.  They work quite well.  The concealer covers well and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy like some others on the market.</li>

    <li> Fast shipping! This foundation blends on my skin perfectly (using Ecotools foundation brush). I have VERY oily skin, but when using this and a nice pressed powder the look is natural and flawless!</li>
    <li> I love the product, it gives me the needed result. Before I brought it, I was wondering if could trust and use any thing online for my face, right now I know it&#x27;s possible.   Thanks to Amazon.com!    [...]</li>

    <li> I was scepticle at first of buying makeup online.. but it was great. in a sealed box and wasn&#x27;t any tampering with it. i will buy this again.</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to do and that&#x27;s provide medium coverage. It fits me complexion to a \\&quot;T\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> It was old (as stated) but probably should have been thrown out not unloaded on customers. The one star is for the Mary Kay brand other than that don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> Makeup i love it, and the price is good also, but shipping price rediculuse, wt. Less than 1oz,&lt;br /&gt;I payed, 14.95 for shipping, the rest of my item i purchased had FREE SHIPPING.....other than that 5stars</li>
    <li> The Mary Kay Medium Coverage Foundation Bronze 607 is a wonderful foundation and it is not too heavy. It only takes a small amount to get complete facial and neck coverage.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of May Kay cosmetics</li>
    <li> The packaging was impressive. I tried to buy more but the seller didn&#x27;t have more available. I love the product and i&#x27;ll buy it again and again.</li>
    <li> Nice products I bought the wrong color .</li>
    <li> The product is what I wanted and I have no complaints about it. I would order again again Thank You</li>
    <li> I love Mary Kay.  It is the only foundation I will wear.  It gives good coverage and looks natural.</li>
    <li> Great product despite the expired date. Had no problems at all. I was skeptical but would order again. Good deal.</li>
    <li> I was a bit disappointed that the Mary Kay foundation had expired. I guess this is why it&#x27;s slightly cheaper than new merchandise.  I am concerned that the product could burn my skin or just not do exactly what it should do. Be careful and ask for the expiration date.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot to say about the foundation because that is what I wear all the time no change and no difference</li>
    <li> Love my Mary Kay foundation, used it for many years. Only downside to buying it this way is that it&#x27;s out dated, 4/2013. I will find a Mary Kay rep soon in my new town to avoid this problem.</li>
    <li> Right color for my complexion.  I will buy this product always and will recommend it to my family &amp; friends. Thank you</li>
    <li> i love Mary Kay Foundation!! i placed my order and received it only 3 days later, with no hassle!! I LOVED THE EXPERIENCE!</li>
    <li> I ordered Bronze 607 but what was packaged and sent to me was Bronze 600.  I was wondering why the foundation was not matching my skin tone. The box read Bronze 607 but the foundation tube is labeled Bronze 600.  By the time I notice the difference, I had already discarded the package with it labeling into the trash. It would be nice if I could get the Bronze 607.  Thank you.  Sharon</li>
    <li> Product is great and it arrived earlier then expected.</li>
    <li> Came fast, and I will order again!!!</li>
    <li> expired product, dont buy!</li>
    <li> I was told by a Mary Kay Rep that this tone (Bronze 607) was obsolete. I&#x27;m so glad I can purchase it on line through Amazon!</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s the right one but it&#x27;s expired, but I realized it after I put it on and my face dried out 😒. I would like to get a new and not expired one.</li>
    <li> this is the foundation that i have used for over 7 years and when i recieved this it had used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always a sucker for Mary Kay...no regrets for the purchase. I was very satisfied and would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;:) :)</li>
    <li> I love Mary Kay. Goes on great and not heavy at all.</li>
    <li> I love this foundation and I always have. I just moved and therefore didn&#x27;t have a consultant anymore, so I decided to order it off of Amazon. When I received it I noticed that the expiration date had passed. I thought twice about sending it back, but I was in desperate need of foundation. I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts or noticed anything wrong with it since using it which is why it still gets 3 out of 5 stars. I just do not think it is right for this seller to sell expired make-up.... Lesson learned. I need to find a REAL consultant.</li>
    <li> Product was fresh and new, went  in smooth. I love it and will order it again and again. I am a happy customer.</li>
    <li> The price is great. Can&#x27;t find a rep in my area.</li>
    <li> This is the best foundation for my complexion, My favorite! I am so happy I found it online because I could not purchase it from a MK sales rep.</li>
