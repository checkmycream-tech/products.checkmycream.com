<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good quality for the price and amount you get.</li>
    <li> Best ones I&#x27;ve found for the price!! Really good quality. I&#x27;ve bought some in bulk and they break off in my mascara tubes!! No good!! I&#x27;m an MUA and these are a must!!</li>
    <li> Bought these to clean jewelry with, worked exactly as i had hoped. Definitely have more than I will ever need for that purpose so I may use them for cosmetics or crafts in the future as well.</li>
    <li> Do not order this item this is not what arrives you actually get a 50/50 split of mascara wands and lip stick applicators</li>
    <li> Awesome price! Nicely packaged! Fast shipping! Super happy customer!!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and the packaging was great and easy to reuse for safe storage. Awesome mascara wands, soft and the color is fun and different.</li>
    <li> Good quality great price. A must have for separating eyelashes and getting rid of clumps.  Good for eyebrows too.</li>
    <li> Hi, I Love these Wands.  Especially because they are pink and I can judge how much mascara I am using for samples.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Love these cute little brushes ! Always come on time</li>
    <li> I love having these around.  I keep them in my car, backpack, purse, makeup drawer, gym bag, everywhere!  Awesome for brow-taming on the go, and I also use between mascara coats.  It&#x27;s nice to have so many, because if I misplace a few there are plenty more.</li>
    <li> nice packaging and the product is well made</li>
    <li> I love these they work well for trying to grow eyelashes and eyebrows. Soft bristles not harsh on the delicate area, they&#x27;re wonderful.</li>
    <li> Excellent, these are so soft not stiff and scratch like some others and the pink is great!</li>
    <li> fast shipping. cute color! works well</li>
    <li> Amazing price. As a makeup minimalist I find that having well groomed lashes &amp; brows is a must. These are better than the plastic tools you can buy at the drug store. You can apply aloe gel, petroleum, makeup, whatever - and pull off a clean minimalist makeup look.</li>
    <li> I use these on my clients and they work perfect!!! I even use them on myself.</li>
    <li> Just as stated, they are what they are disposable mascara brushes!!!!!</li>
    <li> The ladies love the pink!!! lol</li>
    <li> very good quality, use everyday for clients will order again</li>
    <li> Exactly what I Wanted and Expected❤  The  Pink is super cute and different .  My Clients will LOVE this also!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> The best of the best! I love these little wands when I do eyelash extensions, they are small &amp; precise. Plus my clients love the pink! &amp;#60;3 Will purchase over &amp; over again!</li>
    <li> Great for separating lashes after applying mascara.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great. I use them to comb through my lashes between coats of mascara as well as on my eyebrows. They are the perfect combination of firm and soft and came in I nice bag with a zip-like closure for storage. They are defiantly worth the cost.</li>
    <li> so cute! I will buy again!</li>
    <li> These work great! Use them to apply cold pressed castor oil to improve lashes &amp; eyebrows</li>
    <li> I use these when applying my mascara.  They separate my lashes get off any clumps and allow you to do several passes to build lashes without looking over coated.  I don&#x27;t know about their normal use but they are perfect for lash separation and you can use one over and over until it gets too coated so the pack will probably last me a year.  Really works well used to use a straight pin or a safety pin when I was younger this is so much safer.  Even though I use an awesome mascara that has a great brush these take it to another level.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed, at way less than retail even with the higher price for Amazon Prime. Cut pink color too.</li>
    <li> Love these! So cute. My clients compliment me on them all the time.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I did without them. Great disposable brushes.</li>
    <li> This is just what I needed!&lt;br /&gt;I put in my mascara, then use these to get rid of clumps!</li>
    <li> Slightly flimsy but I don&#x27;t need anything super sturdy so these work just fine for me!</li>
    <li> Really like these brushes.  I use them to separate my lashes after applying mascara and for grooming my brows.  Good value too. I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
    <li> Pink and black spoolies!  Perfect, they feel just like normal all black ones but look much cooler!  I wish there was a pink, pink &amp; black, pink &amp; white mixed lot.  I have so many now I can&#x27;t really justify buying the all pink or pink &amp; white.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and product was great.</li>
    <li> I am constantly going through disposable applicators and need bulk of everything. These were a great price and the shipping was unbelievably fast! I love that they&#x27;re pink so I can see the product. Will definitely be buying these again next time!</li>
    <li> Terrific for combing out clumps of mascara. Almost feel bad about using once and throwing away, but not at this price!</li>
    <li> does what it&#x27;s supposed to do! Love the fact that it&#x27;s pink! lol</li>
    <li> When I first got lash extensions, the stylist gave me a care kit that included 5 plain &amp;#34;spoolie&amp;#34; wands like these. The wands are perfect for combing and separating lashes into a curl, especially for those of us who prefer little or no mascara with our extensions. This mega-pack of spoolies allows me to keep one handy in all my purses, around the house, in my car, and wherever I might need one.</li>
    <li> I am a makeup artist and I use these to keep my products sanitary, clients love them and are always asking where I got them</li>
    <li> Great for my business!</li>
    <li> amazing! i can stop hijacking them from ulta and sephora!! hahahaha</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for my kit, and keeping things sanitary between clients!</li>
    <li> They are good bushes they get the jobs done</li>
    <li> My daughter loves using these to separate the eyelashes after applying mascara. I am sure that they have a number of different uses though. (Kind of like Q-tips)</li>
    <li> Good product and great price</li>
    <li> Bought these to remove excess mascara and separate my lashes, and they work great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an esthetician and when I saw these I thought, wow... they are large, however, they proved to be great wands.  They hold brow hairs up better than any I&#x27;ve used before in order for me to trim hairs and groom the brows.  I am impressed.  As far as makeup application goes... I&#x27;m not too sure.  They are large and not petite wands... the bristle portion is very big.  I would want smaller ones for eyelash mascara application if it were me.</li>
    <li> Love these for separating lashes after applying mascara and removing any clumps. Very light and easy to roll down my lashes.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and great price point! I love that fact that the wands are pink. I am able to see how much product I have on the wanf because of that. I also LOVE PINK!!!! Best addition to my kit!</li>
