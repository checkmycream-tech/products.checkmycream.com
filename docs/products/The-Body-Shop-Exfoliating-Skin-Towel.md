### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This &#x27;towel&#x27; works great!</li>
      <li>Good product and communication!</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>Good value and longevity</li>
      <li>Really good stuff.</li>
      <li>This is a nice exfoliating towel, but it wasn&#x27;t as nice as a Body Shop version I bought years ago.  </li>
      <li>The exfoliation feels great and leaves me feeling clean.</li>
      <li>Extremely glad I purchased it, and the price couldn&#x27;t be beat.</li>
      <li>Love these towels.</li>
      <li>To work up the best lather for use, wet the towel before and after adding the soap, then manipulate to create the foam.</li>
      <li>So if you need to make either one longer, depending on your body size, it&#x27;s easy to sew two units together.  </li>
      <li>This really works exceptional and serves its purpose well.  </li>
      <li>I liked this product a lot at first.</li>
      <li>but this is great and helps wash your back.</li>
      <li>but the surface of this towel is so aggressive that I can&#x27;t enjoy it.  </li>
      <li>It makes good use of just a bit of my liquid cleanser, and is easy adjusted to different body parts.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this kind of cloth for several years and this one by The Body Shop is so much better.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t feel properly clean and glowing without one.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t always have good arm movement to reach my back, but this does the job well.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Vic&#x27;s face cloth for at least 20 years and it was the best product I had found for my face.</li>
      <li>They really exfoliate well, foam up nicely with body wash, and are easy to keep clean as they dry out quickly.  </li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I just add some liquid bath soap and I feel super clean and soft!</li>
      <li>The towel itself is very flexible and dries quickly.  </li>
      <li>Great for reaching your entire back.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad that I finally found it.  </li>
      <li>I love this thing and have bought several of them over the years.  </li>
      <li>exfoliates and leaves my skin really really soft and feeling clean.</li>
      <li>(it works well with bar soap and can readily be tossed in the wash); my first choice is this towel, which I use on my face and pretty much everywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
      <li>I bought this for an elderly friend who also needs more length since she has limited mobility.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s long enough to reach all areas, cleans/exfoliates very well without damaging skin, works up a good lather with just a bit of soap, and rinses out very easily.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This towel is fantastic not only for use in the shower, but for removing grease from your hands after working on a vehicle.</li>
      <li>I love how my skin feels after using this towel, smoother than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>The first time you use it, you&#x27;ll feel like it&#x27;s too harsh, but give it time and wear it in, and you&#x27;ll love that scrubbed-clean feeling.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>i grab it to exfoliate, but it is not thick like in the picture</li>
      <li>Both brands are nice and long, thin, and strong.  </li>
      <li>Some of the other are made with a thinner fabric and aren&#x27;t as &amp;#34;rough.&amp;#34; These cloths work  much better than other things for scrubbing your back and are far more sanitary than some things on the market.</li>
      <li>It also does dry quickly.  </li>
      <li>Scrubs really well, but feels a bit rougher than the Japanese (Salux) towel.</li>
      <li>Such bags can be readily found at &#x27;bed and bath&#x27; stores.</li>
      <li>This thing does its job so well though that it deserves at least an OK rating.</li>
      <li>I usually use the Asian ones but this was better.  </li>
      <li>It can be cleaned readily in a washer with cold or warm (not hot) water if first placed in a bag designed to protect delicates.</li>
      <li>Not sure how long they last with daily use, but it certainly makes it easy getting my back.  </li>
      <li>It took a few showers for me to get used to the Solux, which is more abrasive than the Body Shop cloth, but I did give it a favorable review after I learned to use it with less force.  </li>
      <li>This skin towel is just right for exfoliation--not too hard, not too soft.  </li>

<li> This skin towel is just right for exfoliation--not too hard, not too soft.  </li>
<li> This one is just right - have tried another one that was to thick and short-</li>

<li> This one is slightly shorter at 36 inches, which I felt was not quite long enough.  </li>
<li> long by 11&amp;#34; wide.  </li>

<li> In addition to being less abrasive, the BS brand can hold the lather longer for a soapier bath.</li>
<li> its just gonna be a long thin rough sheet,</li>
<li> For the face, take care to not use it too vigorously, as otherwise it can be a bit harsh.</li>
<li> May buy a few for gifts.</li>
<li> Not as harsh as nylon scrubbers  </li>

    <li> I liked this product a lot at first. Unfortunately, after a few washes, it stopped working as well as it did in the beginning, forcing me to have to repurchase the item.</li>
    <li> This is a nice exfoliating towel, but it wasn&#x27;t as nice as a Body Shop version I bought years ago.  I&#x27;m not sure if soap and time have perhaps played roles in softening mine.  This one is slightly shorter at 36 inches, which I felt was not quite long enough.  I would like to see one that is 48 inches since I am quite tall.  I bought this for an elderly friend who also needs more length since she has limited mobility.</li>
    <li> This &#x27;towel&#x27; works great! As mentioned in at least one other review, liquid (not bar soap) soap should be used with it. It&#x27;s long enough to reach all areas, cleans/exfoliates very well without damaging skin, works up a good lather with just a bit of soap, and rinses out very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Vic&#x27;s face cloth for at least 20 years and it was the best product I had found for my face. Now, I only use it when I&#x27;m in a hurry (it works well with bar soap and can readily be tossed in the wash); my first choice is this towel, which I use on my face and pretty much everywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (8/2012): I use my Vic&#x27;s face cloth on my face and this towel elsewhere. For the face, take care to not use it too vigorously, as otherwise it can be a bit harsh. It can be cleaned readily in a washer with cold or warm (not hot) water if first placed in a bag designed to protect delicates. Such bags can be readily found at &#x27;bed and bath&#x27; stores. To work up the best lather for use, wet the towel before and after adding the soap, then manipulate to create the foam.</li>
    <li> Works great. Really good stuff. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I love how my skin feels after using this towel, smoother than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.  It makes good use of just a bit of my liquid cleanser, and is easy adjusted to different body parts.  I don&#x27;t always have good arm movement to reach my back, but this does the job well.  The only down side is that a few strands of thread work loose at the edges and are annoying.  May buy a few for gifts.</li>
    <li> Love these towels. Have used one for years and had to replace it after about 10 years of using every day. This one is just right - have tried another one that was to thick and short- but this is great and helps wash your back.</li>
    <li> I bought this item decades ago at a 99c shop and I thought that it would never wear out.  When it unfortunately started to tear a few years ago, I replaced it with the Solux, which was the closest thing that I could find.  It took a few showers for me to get used to the Solux, which is more abrasive than the Body Shop cloth, but I did give it a favorable review after I learned to use it with less force.  Both brands are nice and long, thin, and strong.  So if you need to make either one longer, depending on your body size, it&#x27;s easy to sew two units together.  However, I do prefer the Body Shop cloth over the Solux and I&#x27;m glad that I finally found it.  In addition to being less abrasive, the BS brand can hold the lather longer for a soapier bath.</li>
    <li> This skin towel is just right for exfoliation--not too hard, not too soft.  I use it every couple of days (every day for me is too often).  The towel itself is very flexible and dries quickly.  Extremely glad I purchased it, and the price couldn&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Eh i use it i grab it to exfoliate, but it is not thick like in the picture its just gonna be a long thin rough sheet, whatever it does its job</li>
    <li> Not as harsh as nylon scrubbers  My partner prefers nylon ones as they don&#x27;t soften over time. Good value and longevity</li>
    <li> Exfoliate, it does.  It also does dry quickly.  I would give it five stars, however, the sides started to fall apart after about a month of use.  It seems they could have invested another $0.03 into this and run stitches up the sides too.  To me, something falling apart under expected use is at least a three-star downgrade.  This thing does its job so well though that it deserves at least an OK rating.</li>
    <li> This towel works so well. I just add some liquid bath soap and I feel super clean and soft! Great for reaching your entire back.</li>
    <li> Good product and communication! The exfoliation feels great and leaves me feeling clean. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This really works exceptional and serves its purpose well.  I&#x27;m going to buy another one just to have on hand.  Not sure how long they last with daily use, but it certainly makes it easy getting my back.  It&#x27;s measurements are 35&amp;#34; long by 11&amp;#34; wide.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this kind of cloth for several years and this one by The Body Shop is so much better. Some of the other are made with a thinner fabric and aren&#x27;t as &amp;#34;rough.&amp;#34; These cloths work  much better than other things for scrubbing your back and are far more sanitary than some things on the market. My skin definitely feels polished after using this cloth. I sent my daughter one  and she loves it too.</li>
    <li> Scrubs really well, but feels a bit rougher than the Japanese (Salux) towel. However, it is much bigger than the Japanese one and therefore it is super-comfy for washing my back. I think the product description doesn&#x27;t include measurements so in case you&#x27;re wondering, it&#x27;s 34x11 inches (approx).&lt;br /&gt;Overall, no complaints and it does what it is supposed to do- exfoliates and leaves my skin really really soft and feeling clean.</li>
    <li> This towel is fantastic not only for use in the shower, but for removing grease from your hands after working on a vehicle. I would only use it for one use or the other however, as the grease is not easily removed afterwards.</li>
    <li> I wanted a long washrag that had a bit of roughness to exfoliate in the shower.  I got the length but the surface of this towel is so aggressive that I can&#x27;t enjoy it.  i thought I might just have wimpy skin, but after three tries, days apart, I have parked the towel in the garage to remove bugs from my windshield.  Sorry, this towel is not for me</li>
    <li> I usually use the Asian ones but this was better.  It was rougher in texture. Seems like it&#x27;s getting the job done. Will look for this product again.</li>
    <li> I love this thing and have bought several of them over the years.  They really exfoliate well, foam up nicely with body wash, and are easy to keep clean as they dry out quickly.  The first time you use it, you&#x27;ll feel like it&#x27;s too harsh, but give it time and wear it in, and you&#x27;ll love that scrubbed-clean feeling.  My post-shower body lotion just soaks into my skin instantly after I use this skin towel.  I can&#x27;t feel properly clean and glowing without one.</li>
