      <li>Thanks philosophy for a rip off!</li>

      <li>First Philosophy purchase.</li>

      <li>It absorbs right away, has a nice neutral smell and my hands are comfortably soft all day long.</li>
      <li>Keeps my hands soft and has a clean smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
      <li>Finally my hands are nice and soft.  </li>

      <li>One day I decided to try using it as a hand cream because I wanted something to absorb quickly and yet leave my hands really soft</li>

      <li>I really like this product.  </li>

      <li>You are better off buying Vaseline hand and nail lotion in the pink tube!</li>
      <li>Purchased this as a gift for the wife, at her request due to other reviews, and she is extremely happy with it.</li>
      <li>I used this lotion for a few days and amazingly they were soft and they no longer caught on fabric.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love the thick nourishing feeling to this cream. Keeps my hands soft and has a clean smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering. I actually use a small amount on my face when it gets too dry.</li>
    <li> NOT AT ALL impressed with this lotion. Not worth the amount paid! With it being &amp;#34;philosophy&amp;#34; I was expecting a better product with at least the &amp;#34;philosophy&amp;#34; fragrance. You are better off buying Vaseline hand and nail lotion in the pink tube! This lotion to me is NOT adviseable! Thanks philosophy for a rip off! First and last time purchasing this item!</li>
    <li> My mother and I both use this - I order it for her regularly. I don&#x27;t often rave about hand creams but this one WORKS. It absorbs quickly, is smooth, thick, and keeps my hands hydrated. I have tried many Philosophy products and while I do not like all of them, this one is a winner.&lt;br /&gt;I have bought these at big box cosmetic stores; the price on Amazon is definitely comparable.</li>
    <li> Awesome hand cream.  It has a light, pleasant smell.  I use this as my night and morning lotion.  I would use it all day long except that it is cost prohibitive, hence the 4 instead of 5 star.  If money wasn&#x27;t an issue I would have a large container of it at home and work!</li>
    <li> Philosophy always has a great product.  This was the first time I&#x27;ve ordered the hand cream and now I keep it all to myself....It&#x27;s great for work when you just need that  softness during a hard day at the office.</li>
    <li> I liked this product so much that I ordered it again.  Great price on AMZN compared to retail and arrives quickly.  This is one lotion that really makes my rough hands feel soft and pampered.  Also noticed a slight improvement in the appearance of my cuticles. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I  like this hand cream!  It is the best I have tried!&lt;br /&gt;My hands are so soft.  I  will always use it now!</li>
    <li> I used this all last winter and never had an episode of chapped hands or cuticle prolems. It is not greasy and readily absorbs into your skin. No perfume scent - which I love. I don&#x27;t need to look any further for a different hand cream.</li>
    <li> Possibly the best hand cream I&#x27;ve used. Not sticky, really softens and heals.</li>
    <li> When the weather changes I get weird itchy dry patches on my hands around my knuckles.  I have tried every kind of lotion and creams I could get my hands on and the majority of them just made the dry patches burn and irritated, but not this.  Just from using it one time I saw a big improvement.  My cuticles are looking great as well!  I will continue to use this for all my dry skin problems!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two months. I&#x27;ve tried many creams over the years. This works best for me. It&#x27;s not greasy and is very moisturizing. I&#x27;ve always had problems in winter no matter what I used. Not anymore.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this hand cream. I have tried many and this is the best. Not too thin and not too thick. Takes a few minutes to sink in, but not at all like a balm. Will be purchasing more when this is gone..do not want to be without!!</li>
    <li> A great moisturizer for the hands. Can also be used on legs and arms if you need a heavy moisturizer. It&#x27;s thick, but dries quickly. I also like that it&#x27;s unscented.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a gift for the wife, at her request due to other reviews, and she is extremely happy with it. Will be purchasing more when the tube runs out.</li>
    <li> non greasy and best product I have found.</li>
    <li> This creme is nice but for the price I was expecting a miracle and definitely didn&#x27;t get that.  It works as well as other drug store creme in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I love this hand cream! Its expensive for me, but I try to get it when I can. Best I ever used and I have very dry skin. Nothing better, been using this hand cream for 3 years &amp; love it. Would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore the Philosophy &amp;#34;Hope&amp;#34; line. There&#x27;s nothing else I would rather use for my chapped hands and fingers than this product. It sinks in to the skin easily, doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue, and if you put it on before bed you wake up with baby soft hands in the morning. Great product, even if it&#x27;s a bit on the steep side for a hand lotion!</li>
    <li> I use this great hand cream every night and sometimes during the day. My hands and cuticles have never looked better. Very light scent.</li>
    <li> Hope hand cream is wonderful.  My hands were like sand paper, very rough and so dry they hurt.  I used this lotion for a few days and amazingly they were soft and they no longer caught on fabric.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT stuff.......</li>
    <li> I have been on a search for a good hand cream and I finally found the one.  Moisurizes without being greasy and lasts for hours.</li>
    <li> Use it sparingly!  A little goes a long way! I apply a dab on each cuticle and work it into both hands with attention to the cuticle.  Even though I handled a lot of paper in a day this cream keeps my hands from drying out.</li>
    <li> not greasy and it&#x27;s unscented. i work in a hospital and it&#x27;s perfect for me. a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I use this in the dry winter months.  Put it on before you go to bed.  Its not greasy or smelly if you decide to apply it during the day, but give it a little time to absorb into your skin.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> One of two of the very best hand creams one can buy.  I love the feel; it feels like warm velvet on one&#x27;s hands.</li>
    <li> A friend introduced me to this hand cream.  I have found this product to be on of the best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Is nice but leaves hands a little greasy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Hope in a Jar and absolutely love it.  One day I decided to try using it as a hand cream because I wanted something to absorb quickly and yet leave my hands really soft and it worked great.  I was super happy to find Hands of Hope because it works just as nicely as Hope in a Jar does.  It absorbs right away, has a nice neutral smell and my hands are comfortably soft all day long. I keep it in my desk drawer and apply a little each time I wash my hands and my hands are never too slippery like with some other hand lotions I&#x27;ve used at work before.  It&#x27;s great as a daily cuticle cream too.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Best hand lotion available!</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion on the market!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best hand lotion ever. very soft and last long</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this hand cream for my 72 year old mother. She absolutely loved it. She said it is not greasy and leaves her hands silky smooth.  She applied it to her arms as well and noticed a definite improvement in her age spots.  She said they are much lighter and asked me to purchase another one.  I ordered another cream from amazon because it is so convenient and saves me a trip to the mall. I had it shipped to my mother&#x27;s address so she doesn&#x27;t have to wait.</li>
    <li> This makes my hands feel so soft! The lotion is very thick and really helps out dry hands. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Learned about it from Prevention Magazine.  Unfortunately, I am not as consistent in applying it to see results.  But plan to do better.  Love the way it spreads easily and leaves no greasy residue</li>
    <li> I use this cream nightly and love it.  Absorbs quickly, no strong fragrance and is very effective in dry winter months.</li>
    <li> I will admit, I am a philosophy girl, so I rarely have anything but good things to say about their products.  My hands feel so soft no one can guess my age.  I am not able to do much with my hands do to health concerns so someone who puts there hands thru torture on a daily basis may not get the same results.</li>
    <li> Every winter I get those cracked hands that most of us do.  This cream keeps it WAY under control and gave me almost immediate results.  Its not cheap, but it is a &amp;#34;worth it&amp;#34; product.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love the Hands of Hope. Finally my hands are nice and soft.  There is no greasy feeling after putting it on.</li>
    <li> I have gotten this in the Business First gift bag on United for years, where I work my hands dry very badly and this seems to be the only stuff that heals it. Usually within 48 hours. Awesome stuff.</li>
    <li> Only cream that works on my hands!  My hands crack with other creams....with this one they stay silky soft.  The best</li>
    <li> This stuff is worth the money. It is non-greasy and you only need a little bit; it lasts for a long time and makes your skin so soft.</li>
    <li> This is the best hand cream ever, and I have tried many. It really moisturizes and a little goes a long way. You can feel the lasting effects even after you wash your hands a couple of times. My hands get very dry from working in a restuarant and constantly washing them and this is my favorite hand cream. Try it you will love it!</li>
    <li> Kind of has funny smell . It&#x27;s ok but I am sure there is better products at the drug store .  This is nothing special .</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion. I have extremely dry skin and it has helped a lot. It smells great and is really thick. It&#x27;s not greasy at all which I like.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  The reason for the 4 is that it is more expensive than I would usually pay.  However, it does make my nails and hands very soft.  I also like the fact that it has minimal scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a little problem with initial delivery ( ie torn mailer and no product!) and they provided excellent ( 5*) customer service to solve my problem.</li>
    <li> Have tried so many lotions and creams. This one does the job. Hands are so soft now and were very dry before. It is just a little greasy so don&#x27;t use too much. Just a little is all you need to do the job.</li>
    <li> This hand cream is a great moisturizer for dry hands and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film.  Especially good in winter months.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this lotion. I love the way my hands feel and I love how long it lasts. Worth the $$</li>
    <li> I gave this item to my sister for Christmas because she has extremely dry hands (like i do) and none of the drugstore products are helpful.  She loved this product.</li>
    <li> Best hand lotion out there!! Won&#x27;t be without it</li>
    <li> My daughter convinced me to try this. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and love this stuff. Ultra moisturizing and have to apply hand cream less often. Priced well in that it is a rich consistency and you will use a whole lot less than normal hand creams. First Philosophy purchase. Will be purchasing more from this product line.&lt;br /&gt;Great Stuff!</li>
    <li> Love , can&#x27;t go wrong wit philosophy . Very pleased</li>
