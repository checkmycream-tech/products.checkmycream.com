      <li>So refreshing and restorative!  </li>
      <li>smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell was nicely lemony, but not floral.</li>
      <li>Nice, compact, convenient.</li>
      <li>These have come in handy for many situations.</li>
      <li>Love these towels they are so handy to have around.</li>
      <li>Definitely a good buy, and the price for the amount was pretty amazing.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE Amazon prime.  </li>
      <li>I carry these while traveling in europe - many hotels do not have wash clothes - these can be rinsed and used again</li>
      <li>IT has paid for itself so many times over.</li>
      <li>We offer these towels to our dental patients after a procedure and they love them.  </li>
      <li>The mango scented ones were too strong and sweet smelling for my taste but many of the women at or event liked them.</li>
      <li>I found that Amazon had a much better price and of course with Amazon prime FREE SHIPPING  </li>
      <li>after their procedure we give them a washcloth, to clean their face and they love it.</li>
      <li>Quick ship!</li>
      <li>I was having a get together with friends and decided that these would be perfect since we were having some food that may be a little sticky on the hands.  </li>
      <li>After a five hour drive into Cody Wyoming on a hot day, we were greeted at hotel check-in with a chilled bowl of these delightful little cotton wash cloths with lemon-zest fragrance.  </li>
      <li>They are soft, smell nice and just the right size.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is also great for wiping up little spills.</li>
      <li>so I can have a fresh towel.  </li>
      <li>These are superb for weddings or any other fancy buffet type event, especially barbecue!</li>
      <li>I freeze then and use after my bike commute to and from work  - they really do the trick!</li>
      <li>It makes you feel like you&#x27;re fying first class.</li>
      <li>First had one at a restaurant as a hand towlette.  </li>
      <li>So of course my first search was through Amazon and sure enough there they were.</li>
      <li>My husband actually like it, which was unusual since he refuses to touch most of my scented</li>
      <li>That pretty much describes every reason I find these</li>
      <li>Stick them in the fridge during the hot summer for a nice refreshing treat, or stick them in a warmer during the winter (they do get a little dry in the warmer).</li>
      <li>Very cost-effective.</li>
      <li>very convenient.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but you don&#x27;t really even need to.  </li>
      <li>I bought these towels years ago at a dental meeting and had forgot how much I loves having them in the car and purse</li>
      <li>It is our way of letting our patients know how much we care about them too.</li>
      <li>The best for a customer that wants a solution to dirty hands during travel.  </li>
      <li>throw them in an ice chest, put them in a oven or microwave and an instant warm wet wipe.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re obviously more expensive than the towelette type paper based wipes, but they&#x27;re truly cloth wipes and do an excellent job on the tough hand and face wipe jobs.</li>
      <li>Made of very thin real cotton terrycloth material, they are moist but not too wet and have a pleasant natural lemon scent that does not over power food or linger too long after use.</li>
      <li>Feel great, I feel bad throwing them</li>

    <li> We offer these towels to our dental patients after a procedure and they love them.  It allows them to freshen up before heading back to work or elsewhere.  They are soft, smell nice and just the right size. It is our way of letting our patients know how much we care about them too.</li>
    <li> Refreshing and delightful. I keep them in my car and gym bag.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re obviously more expensive than the towelette type paper based wipes, but they&#x27;re truly cloth wipes and do an excellent job on the tough hand and face wipe jobs. I keep some of both in the car.</li>
    <li> I bought these towels years ago at a dental meeting and had forgot how much I loves having them in the car and purse so I can have a fresh towel.  When I went to the website and NOT amazon I found that Amazon had a much better price and of course with Amazon prime FREE SHIPPING  BTW  LOVE LOVE LOVE Amazon prime.  IT has paid for itself so many times over.</li>
    <li> Nice, compact, convenient. Purchased for gift baskets and I&#x27;m sure they will be great.</li>
    <li> Love these towels they are so handy to have around.</li>
    <li> Lets start off by saying I have three kids. That pretty much describes every reason I find these very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;They are great for wiping dirty faces, dirty hands, or to just freshen up on long trips or even flights.&lt;br /&gt;It is also great for wiping up little spills. Great product to just have in your bag as a just in case, and it smells good also.</li>
    <li> This work well for a rib or crab towel instead of the little packets at dinner but&lt;br /&gt;you have to be very careful not to explode them!</li>
    <li> awesome product. awesome product. awesome product. awesome product. awesome product. awesome product. awesome product.</li>

    <li> Awesome.  The best scent for sure offered.  The best for a customer that wants a solution to dirty hands during travel.  They work in the air or a long car ride.  Both hot and cold.  throw them in an ice chest, put them in a oven or microwave and an instant warm wet wipe.</li>
    <li> I use these for patients at my office.  Everyone loves the lemon ones.  Stick them in the fridge during the hot summer for a nice refreshing treat, or stick them in a warmer during the winter (they do get a little dry in the warmer).</li>
    <li> These are superb for weddings or any other fancy buffet type event, especially barbecue! Made of very thin real cotton terrycloth material, they are moist but not too wet and have a pleasant natural lemon scent that does not over power food or linger too long after use. The mango scented ones were too strong and sweet smelling for my taste but many of the women at or event liked them. Really great product!</li>
    <li> My daughter had bought these for her wedding guest for appetizers.  We use them when we&lt;br /&gt;are traveling and hiking now.</li>
    <li> I got these as an alternative to some of the other wet-nap-type clothes I usually carry in my purse. I was pleasantly surprised to discover they were actual cloths, instead of the usual thin towel-ish napkin you get with most wipes. It could actually be re-used if you wanted, or used as a cleaning cloth after tossing it in the wash. It looks very similar to a washcloth, but a bit smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell was nicely lemony, but not floral. My husband actually like it, which was unusual since he refuses to touch most of my scented wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think these would be a great addition to picnics, cars, trips--any place you might need a quit freshening/cleaning. I&#x27;d even feel comfortable handing them out for messy dinners like bbqs or fried chicken. Definitely a good buy, and the price for the amount was pretty amazing. Very cost-effective.</li>
    <li> These have come in handy for many situations. Wash them and use for little rags!</li>
    <li> I dont use anything frome the wips becouse they have bad smell</li>
    <li> Great product! I freeze then and use after my bike commute to and from work  - they really do the trick!</li>
    <li> great product.  after their procedure we give them a washcloth, to clean their face and they love it.</li>
    <li> A little pricey, but they&#x27;re a luxury item and I knew that when purchasing.  Feel great, I feel bad throwing them out- but you don&#x27;t really even need to.  They can be washed and used for lots of things.</li>
    <li> Went to a restaurant in Rohoboth Beach, De.  and they used these for their breafkfast buffet.  I was having a get together with friends and decided that these would be perfect since we were having some food that may be a little sticky on the hands.  So of course my first search was through Amazon and sure enough there they were. Excellent product and they stay moist for quite a while.  Everyone loved them.</li>
    <li> Great towelettes! Quick ship!</li>
    <li> After a five hour drive into Cody Wyoming on a hot day, we were greeted at hotel check-in with a chilled bowl of these delightful little cotton wash cloths with lemon-zest fragrance.  So refreshing and restorative!  We&#x27;ve since ordered a case of lemon and unscented for our car-trip cooler and to place in our guest rooms.  It makes you feel like you&#x27;re fying first class.</li>
    <li> First had one at a restaurant as a hand towlette.  I keep them in my purse and car now.  The cotton towlette makes a great face or cleaning.</li>
