      <li>but this was nice.</li>
      <li>It was a nice color</li>
      <li>It should blend nicely with your skin tone and clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It looked nice against a room with muted pumpkin walls, avocado-to-olive couch and chairs, and goldenrod accents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and she wears all shades of oranges, warm pinks, deeper greens like olive, forest, moss and army.</li>
      <li>I am usually a great fan of OpI and never disappointed by the color.</li>
      <li>Beautiful color, a golden rose.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use, thinner than some OPI polishes.</li>
      <li>It is so fun and great for all seasons in my opinion.</li>
      <li>/&gt;OPI has the best brush I have tested so far.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I held my nails by pretty, warm toned rooms in my Ethan Allen decorating book and it fit in beautifully.</li>
      <li>The color is still pretty and the consistency was great.</li>
      <li>As always, a true and gorgeous shade addition from the pinnacle of polish makers.</li>

      <li>Put a top coat on.</li>
      <li>OPI polish is the best and the only brand I use myself.</li>

      <li>I love this color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more a shade a muted clay mudd.</li>
      <li>I always love OPI nail polish colors.  </li>
      <li>Love Love Love Opi.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll still wear it, but not my favorite.</li>
      <li>I loved this stuff when it first came out but now dispite how mant top and bottom coats you use it just falls off my nails..still love the colour so if its working better for you go for it</li>
      <li>It has a beautiful, soft shimmer.</li>
      <li>I love OPI products, but since the color is unusual, I love it even more!</li>
      <li>This is the perfect pink for work or a wedding.  </li>
      <li>delightful pinky pink..</li>
      <li>I loved it so much that I came home and searched for it online.  </li>
      <li>Nice shade, bright but not overwhelming for my extremely fair (porcelain) skin.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>This is a nice thick polish, and a great color!  </li>
      <li>If your counting on getting a pretty rose color as pictured think again.</li>
      <li>This picture isn&#x27;t accurate.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and only takes one coat for the color to match the bottle color, which I am happy about.</li>
      <li>Quick, easy and secure</li>
      <li>Thanks! :)</li>
      <li>/&gt;This should be a great pink for the ladies who like warmer colors.</li>
      <li>I just love the whole collection of colors.  </li>
      <li>I would prefer a little more sparkle, but all in alll a good choice.</li>
      <li>More of a rose color than coral pink.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with this nail polish color because is a pretty pink</li>
      <li>the color is beatiful and exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>That one is a good comparison of cool to this warm pink, both of about similar brightness or intensity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The color looks more pink in the photo but arrived more mauve in color.  </li>
      <li>Her yellows are golden, into orangy.</li>
      <li>love the color was amazingly easy to apply and lasted a good amount of time even without a base and top coat!</li>
      <li>This is a great color of coral with minute particles of red sparkle, barely visible.  </li>
      <li>Pretty shimmery pink with good brush for each 3 stroke application.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The color is great, I rated this product a 4 star and recommend purchasing and can hardly wait to use on a pedicure.</li>
      <li>Great consistency, easy to apply, professional finish and very long lasting.</li>
      <li>It looks pretty in the bottle and goes on the nails pretty close to what one would think by looking at the color.  </li>
      <li>(like I thought it was), but still really pretty.</li>
      <li>Nice Pink</li>
      <li>Pretty in sunlight.</li>
      <li>This is a really pretty color that goes with just about everything I wear.</li>
      <li>Not too bright, not too pale.  </li>
      <li>but I love that it&#x27;s just fun enough for fingers without being too young girl.</li>
      <li>and I was pleased with that, but it doesn&#x27;t wear very long before it chips.</li>
      <li>Based on the pic and the name of this i thought the color would match the picture pretty well, but when i opened the package i found it was much more of a tan or mauve color than pink.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s more vibrant and not soft.</li>
      <li>I really like how it came protected and in the time they said it was gonna arrive.</li>
      <li>The color I received looks more coral than this pink.</li>
      <li>However, this color was prettier on the screen than in real life.  </li>
      <li>This color is so much prettier in person.</li>
      <li>I look much better in blue toned colors and wear pinks, reds, fuchsias, plums, lilacs, purples and clear, emerald greens, all cooler blues.</li>
      <li>I was pretty surprised when i got this nail polish.  </li>
      <li>pretty, warm pink is being sent to my daughter, who is a Spring, with strawberry blonde hair, soft peachy cream skin</li>
      <li>There is a tiny hint of sparkle, just enough to make this polish memorable without being garish.</li>
      <li>This color is really pretty and all, but is kind of thin.</li>
      <li>but, if you are looking for a timeless color that you don&#x27;t have to change every other day with every other outfit, My Address is Hollywood is a good choice.</li>
      <li>Love Opi nail polish for its staying power, but only lasts for about half the bottle.</li>
      <li>What arrived was nowhere near the color or color family.</li>
      <li>Very pretty without being too pink!</li>
      <li>I have a couple other pale, nude type colors that are actually warm toned to send to her.</li>
      <li>Generally what you see is what you get.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Might buy something a  bit mature the next time</li>
      <li>&quot; It is much softer and muted than any Barbie pink.</li>
      <li>It is more of a coral pink than a pink pink, and it is definitely a bolder color.  </li>

    <li> Beautiful color, a golden rose.</li>
    <li> Nice shade, bright but not overwhelming for my extremely fair (porcelain) skin.</li>
    <li> Nice Pink color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might buy something a  bit mature the next time</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Thin coats with no bubbles or streaking.</li>
    <li> Pretty shimmery pink with good brush for each 3 stroke application.&lt;br /&gt;OPI has the best brush I have tested so far.</li>
    <li> the color is a bit different than that in the picture. it&#x27;s more vibrant and not soft. Anyway, it is acceptable.</li>
    <li> As always, a true and gorgeous shade addition from the pinnacle of polish makers. O.P.I. doesn&#x27;t disappoint!</li>
    <li> love the color was amazingly easy to apply and lasted a good amount of time even without a base and top coat! the color is beatiful and exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> Love the color. Just a warning, when I was first putting this on, I was disappointed because it almost looked like more of a coral color. But be patient! When it dried, it was the pink color you&#x27;d expect. Love it!</li>
    <li> I really like how it came protected and in the time they said it was gonna arrive. I&#x27;m happy with this nail polish color because is a pretty pink</li>
    <li> More of a rose color than coral pink.</li>
    <li> The color looks more pink in the photo but arrived more mauve in color.  A little disappointed but not a total lose.</li>
    <li> Part of the black handle was chipped off. I wanted to give this as a gift but couldn&#x27;t because of it.</li>
    <li> I am usually a great fan of OpI and never disappointed by the color. Generally what you see is what you get. If your counting on getting a pretty rose color as pictured think again. What arrived was nowhere near the color or color family. It&#x27;s more a shade a muted clay mudd. Don&#x27;t know if I received something that was accidentally mislabeled or defective. Save your money if your looking for a rosé pink.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love Opi. Great consistency, easy to apply, professional finish and very long lasting. Put a top coat on.</li>
    <li> Is it me or has OPI just decided to change their formulas?..I loved this stuff when it first came out but now dispite how mant top and bottom coats you use it just falls off my nails..still love the colour so if its working better for you go for it delightful pinky pink..but I&#x27;m on the hunt for another product.</li>
    <li> Item is as described and arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> Good price, delivered conveniently to my door in the time promised.</li>
    <li> I love this color. It is so fun and great for all seasons in my opinion. I am so happy to find great deals on OPI products on Amazon- fits my budget just great!</li>
    <li> Not recommend for people who don&#x27;t have fair skin because it tends to be a fluorescence color.</li>
    <li> It was a nice color and I was pleased with that, but it doesn&#x27;t wear very long before it chips.</li>
    <li> For some reason both bottles I ordered seemed watered down.</li>
    <li> I have to admit I like this color better on the computer screen than in person.  It is more of a coral pink than a pink pink, and it is definitely a bolder color.  And it&#x27;s definitely a spring/summer color only.</li>
    <li> I purchased this polish for my mother because she could not find this color in a local store.  OPI polish is the best and the only brand I use myself.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, thinner than some OPI polishes. It has a beautiful, soft shimmer. I look much better in blue toned colors and wear pinks, reds, fuchsias, plums, lilacs, purples and clear, emerald greens, all cooler blues. I am a very light, pinky toned Summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Address Is Hollywood is definitely pink, but a warmer one. I think it could be called a Carnation Pink, using the Crayola box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I held my nails by pretty, warm toned rooms in my Ethan Allen decorating book and it fit in beautifully. It looked nice against a room with muted pumpkin walls, avocado-to-olive couch and chairs, and goldenrod accents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pretty, warm pink is being sent to my daughter, who is a Spring, with strawberry blonde hair, soft peachy cream skin and she wears all shades of oranges, warm pinks, deeper greens like olive, forest, moss and army. Her yellows are golden, into orangy. I have a couple other pale, nude type colors that are actually warm toned to send to her. I still have my soft pinks like Aphrodite&#x27;s Pink Nighty. That one is a good comparison of cool to this warm pink, both of about similar brightness or intensity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This should be a great pink for the ladies who like warmer colors. It should blend nicely with your skin tone and clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are Caucasian. I&#x27;m sorry, I don&#x27;t know what to say for other skin colors, except if you can wear a definite, but warm pink, this could be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps. I do agree with a reviewer who called this \\&quot;a grown-up pink.\\&quot; It is much softer and muted than any Barbie pink.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect pink for work or a wedding.  I wore it for my wedding in May 2012.  Not too bright, not too pale.  The perfect accent with just the slightest bit of sparkle.  I&#x27;m not a shimmer or sparkle lover but this was nice.</li>
    <li> The color is great, I rated this product a 4 star and recommend purchasing and can hardly wait to use on a pedicure.</li>
    <li> Wish they would bring back Suchi loves Sea Shells.&lt;br /&gt;They stopped carrying it in my nail salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would order again.</li>
    <li> OPI Nail Lacquer, Touring American Collection I just love the whole collection of colors.  Have them all and would use nothing else. Love OPI!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a nice thick polish, and a great color!  A little pricey to buy, but cheaper than paying for a manicure.</li>
    <li> This color is so much prettier in person. It goes on smooth and only takes one coat for the color to match the bottle color, which I am happy about. It has really tiny little irredescent pink sparkles that you can&#x27;t see from the picture that adds some extra glam/bling to your mani. It is gorgeous!</li>
    <li> This is a great color of coral with minute particles of red sparkle, barely visible.  I received many compliments on this polish!</li>
    <li> This is a really pretty color that goes with just about everything I wear. Love Opi nail polish for its staying power, but only lasts for about half the bottle. I  usually throw away before it&#x27;s all gone because it becomes too thick and sticky to apply.</li>
    <li> This color is really pretty and all, but is kind of thin. It&#x27;s not very hot pink (like I thought it was), but still really pretty.</li>
    <li> GREAT summer finger color. It looks good on toes too but I love that it&#x27;s just fun enough for fingers without being too young girl.</li>
    <li> This picture isn&#x27;t accurate. The color I received looks more coral than this pink. The color is still pretty and the consistency was great. Unfortunately it&#x27;s just not the shade I was going for.</li>
    <li> I was pretty surprised when i got this nail polish.  I guess a little disappointed too. Based on the pic and the name of this i thought the color would match the picture pretty well, but when i opened the package i found it was much more of a tan or mauve color than pink.  It reminds me of the popular nudes everyone is wearing now.  It is sparkly, so i will still try it, but not what i was expecting at all.</li>
    <li> Arrived as expected! Great packaging of the multiple bottles I purchased and quality appears to be great!  Quick, easy and secure means I would buy again! Thanks! :)</li>
    <li> I love OPI products, but since the color is unusual, I love it even more! It is bright and summery in these wintery months!</li>
    <li> This color is a muted, understated pink. There is a tiny hint of sparkle, just enough to make this polish memorable without being garish. You could wear this color anywhere, day or night, and it goes with just about anything. If you are looking for a super-bright or a super-sparkly, this isn&#x27;t the polish for you - but, if you are looking for a timeless color that you don&#x27;t have to change every other day with every other outfit, My Address is Hollywood is a good choice.</li>
    <li> I picked up this color when getting a manicure a couple of months ago.  I loved it so much that I came home and searched for it online.  Of course Amazon had the best price and I ordered a bottle for myself and one for a friend who&#x27;d said she liked the color.  Very pretty without being too pink!</li>
    <li> Pinkish color with a little sparkle. Pretty in sunlight. Long lasting. I would prefer a little more sparkle, but all in alll a good choice.</li>
    <li> It looks pretty in the bottle and goes on the nails pretty close to what one would think by looking at the color.  I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I always love OPI nail polish colors.  However, this color was prettier on the screen than in real life.  I&#x27;ll still wear it, but not my favorite.</li>
