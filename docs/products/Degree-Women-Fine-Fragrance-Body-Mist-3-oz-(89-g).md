      <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>I really love this fragrance, I think it&#x27;s nice for after bath, a good morniing fragrance</li>
      <li>But this one just doesn&#x27;t have the nice scent of &amp;#34;sexy intrigue&amp;#34</li>
      <li>it is okay fair and</li>
      <li>That being said, it&#x27;s a nice scent and not overpowering, as appropriate for a body mist.</li>
      <li>but it was ok and worth the buy for me and was happy with what I got</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the Dove sprays that go with the Dove deodorants to good effect--a nice refresher on a hot day, spritz a bit and comb through hair to freshen up, etc.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s very light , I&#x27;d wear it mostly in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>That is why I am so glad someone stocks it here on amazon.</li>
      <li>I love that it coordinates with the Degree antiperspirant/deodorant.</li>
      <li>and i fell in love with it , its not too overpowering</li>
      <li>but the smell is sensual and sexy.</li>
      <li>I have NEVER had this many compliments on a scent.</li>
      <li>I love the degree sexy intrigue i have so many body sprays that i hadnt gotten a chance to try this until yesterday</li>
      <li>This is my favorite fragrance which can no longer be found in retail stores.  </li>
      <li>So glad I found somewhere to get some more.</li>
      <li>I bought the Sexy Intrigue deodorant and it had the matching 1 oz.</li>

      <li>I fell in love with the fragrance.</li>
      <li>This is one of her favorite Degree fragrances</li>
      <li>It is a nice fragrance that is not too over-powering and very fresh smelling.</li>
      <li>I purchased the Degree Women&#x27;s Fine Fragrance Body Mist-Sexy Intrigue along with the Degree Anti-Perspirant/Deodorant for my daughter for Christmas for stocking stuffers.</li>
      <li>; that I enjoy with the degree deodorant stick, it is just a cloying, somewhat sweet, but mostly rubbing alcohol type scent.</li>
      <li>Wonderful long lasting scent.</li>
      <li>It smells exactly like Burberry!</li>
      <li>:) Aside from the crazy effect it has on these men, I think it&#x27;s a wonderful sensual scent that doesn&#x27;t over-power or give me headaches.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Smells really light yet SEXY at the same time.</li>
      <li>Shipped pretty quickly too.</li>
      <li>I still almost never use any other fragrance and having it again just brings me happiness.  </li>
      <li>This is my first internet purchase</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>Fast and curtious service!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hilarious, the inner beast it brings out.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend remembers how I smelled when we first started dating two years ago.</li>
      <li>Was almost the same as my original, but not quite.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the purchase though!</li>
      <li>its hard finding good body spray that smells good on you that doesn&#x27;t cost a lot,  really really hope they bring this back to the stores or at least be available to buy it online,  </li>
      <li>She absolutely loves it</li>
      <li>My co worker even asked me where I got it because he wants to order one for his girl.</li>
      <li>Thanks degree</li>
      <li>When I could no longer find it on store shelves, I was ready to celebrate when I found it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very much a modern drug-store perfume scent, which isnt&#x27; what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Thanks for having were</li>
      <li>Haha.</li>
      <li>I own all of Burberry&#x27;s scents and actually this one is right up there as far as personal scent choice goes for me...</li>
      <li>Even though I have other fragrances that cost $6 to 8 times more, it became the one I used.</li>
      <li>When I was with my ex boyfriend, I could spray this while in the other room, and within 30 seconds he would be on top of me, trying to inhale it.</li>
      <li>I really love the scent this deodorant has and was happy to find the fragrance version, but the carrier base really does make a difference.</li>
      <li>I used to wear this when I was in High School.</li>
      <li>I was so sad to discover it had been discontinued and was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Glad I found a few bottles at Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>This is honestly the only scent I can ever wear, even with all the other options out there both expensive and cheap, Degree&#x27;s Sexy Intrigue is an extension of my self.</li>
      <li>I think this will be my new sent for summer.</li>
      <li>i love sexy intrigue body spray by degree,  its sad that they quit making it an aren&#x27;t selling it anymore, i do hope it comes back!!!</li>
      <li>The scent came in Degree&#x27;s later packaging style with a narrower shape to the bottle, but still smells the same (just newer) as my older version of this stuff I have been saving.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m super picky with perfume/body mist/etc, it&#x27;s usually too strong or too fake smelling.</li>

    <li> I love the degree sexy intrigue i have so many body sprays that i hadnt gotten a chance to try this until yesterday and i fell in love with it , its not too overpowering but the smell is sensual and sexy. I think this will be my new sent for summer.</li>
    <li> This is a great find if you can get your hands on it. It smells exactly like Burberry! I own all of Burberry&#x27;s scents and actually this one is right up there as far as personal scent choice goes for me... granted it does not last long, but it&#x27;s only a body spray people. Carry it with you and keep reapplying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells really light yet SEXY at the same time. Won&#x27;t give you a headache or offend anyone, and the guys LOVE IT!! ;)</li>
    <li> I bought the Sexy Intrigue deodorant and it had the matching 1 oz. sample of body mist. When I was with my ex boyfriend, I could spray this while in the other room, and within 30 seconds he would be on top of me, trying to inhale it. Haha. My current boyfriend hugs me tightly while smelling my neck and making noises. It&#x27;s hilarious, the inner beast it brings out. :) Aside from the crazy effect it has on these men, I think it&#x27;s a wonderful sensual scent that doesn&#x27;t over-power or give me headaches. I&#x27;m super picky with perfume/body mist/etc, it&#x27;s usually too strong or too fake smelling. But this is a keeper!!!</li>
    <li> it is okay fair and alright but it was ok and worth the buy for me and was happy with what I got</li>
    <li> Used to purchase this in the stores but it started to disappear.  I started hunting it down on the Internet.  I&#x27;m really hoping this isn&#x27;t a sign that it will be &#x27;an item of the past&#x27; and no longer be sold.  I love this stuff.  Shipping makes the cost a little insane but I figured I&#x27;d get while I could!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product immediately after my friend let me use hers. I was stopped in the produce section of my grocery store once by an employee telling me how great I smelled. Creepy, but flattering! I have NEVER had this many compliments on a scent. My $80 perfume didn&#x27;t even come close. PLEASE DEGREE, DO NOT DISCONTINUE!!!</li>
    <li> This is not the same as the one they sold in stores. It smells like I&#x27;m spraying rubbing alcohol on me. I will not be repurchasing</li>
    <li> Wish this had not been discontinued. Thank goodness there was plenty in stock. Stocked up with plenty for now. Yeah</li>
    <li> I really love the scent this deodorant has and was happy to find the fragrance version, but the carrier base really does make a difference. There&#x27;s a coconut-like scent to the deodorant that lends a creamy solid undertone to this fragrance and the body mist of course lacks that, making the sandalwood sharper. It&#x27;s very much a modern drug-store perfume scent, which isnt&#x27; what I wanted. That being said, it&#x27;s a nice scent and not overpowering, as appropriate for a body mist.</li>
    <li> Been looking for this for a while.... finally found it.  Thanks for having were I can find it again!  Love it</li>
    <li> I really love this fragrance, I think it&#x27;s nice for after bath, a good morniing fragrance, it&#x27;s very light , I&#x27;d wear it mostly in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Virginia</li>
    <li> Years ago I found Degree Fragrance Body Mist at a drug store. Because I ballroom dance, I thought I&#x27;d try it. I trust and use other Degree brands. I fell in love with the fragrance. Even though I have other fragrances that cost $6 to 8 times more, it became the one I used. When I could no longer find it on store shelves, I was ready to celebrate when I found it on Amazon. I still almost never use any other fragrance and having it again just brings me happiness.  Thank you Amazon, thank you Degree. But also, Degree should not take it away. I know it was not marketed. I never heard about it. I have 6 bottles now and I&#x27;ve shared 2 with relatives who also tell me they love it. This is my first internet purchase and I&#x27;m a very satisfied internet shopper</li>
    <li> Was almost the same as my original, but not quite.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the purchase though!</li>
    <li> I have a million body sprays and perfumes, but this has been my go-to body spray ever since I discovered it. I love that it coordinates with the Degree antiperspirant/deodorant. I was so sad to discover it had been discontinued and was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I used to wear this when I was in High School. Sad they don&#x27;t make it any more. iw ill be buuying more before anyone else runs out of their stock.</li>
    <li> i love sexy intrigue body spray by degree,  its sad that they quit making it an aren&#x27;t selling it anymore, i do hope it comes back!!! its hard finding good body spray that smells good on you that doesn&#x27;t cost a lot,  really really hope they bring this back to the stores or at least be available to buy it online,  its the best!</li>
    <li> This bottle was almost like it had been watered down compared to same product I had gotten elsewhere</li>
    <li> I purchased the Degree Women&#x27;s Fine Fragrance Body Mist-Sexy Intrigue along with the Degree Anti-Perspirant/Deodorant for my daughter for Christmas for stocking stuffers. This is one of her favorite Degree fragrances and she couldn&#x27;t find it in our local stores anymore. She absolutely loves it and I got to try it myself!  It is a nice fragrance that is not too over-powering and very fresh smelling. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I always love the smell.</li>
    <li> I used to buy this in stores all the time until it suddenly disappeared. It smells great. My co worker even asked me where I got it because he wants to order one for his girl.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite fragrance which can no longer be found in retail stores.  Glad I found a few bottles at Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I was getting this to hopefully complement the deodorant/antiperspirant stick of the same name/brand. I&#x27;ve used the Dove sprays that go with the Dove deodorants to good effect--a nice refresher on a hot day, spritz a bit and comb through hair to freshen up, etc.  But this one just doesn&#x27;t have the nice scent of &amp;#34;sexy intrigue&amp;#34; that I enjoy with the degree deodorant stick, it is just a cloying, somewhat sweet, but mostly rubbing alcohol type scent. Too bad. I guess I know why I can&#x27;t find it in stores, it&#x27;s just not very good.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re all asking, why did this stuff discontinue? It&#x27;s amazing. It smells like a million bucks. My boyfriend remembers how I smelled when we first started dating two years ago. I haven&#x27;t worn it in that long! That is why I am so glad someone stocks it here on amazon. I stocked up a bit but, I&#x27;ll likely be back again. I hate that they charge so much for shipping but, what can you do, you know? The scent came in Degree&#x27;s later packaging style with a narrower shape to the bottle, but still smells the same (just newer) as my older version of this stuff I have been saving. Shipped pretty quickly too. This is honestly the only scent I can ever wear, even with all the other options out there both expensive and cheap, Degree&#x27;s Sexy Intrigue is an extension of my self. Until I find something that smells just* like this scent, I will continue to stock up on this.</li>
    <li> Wonderful long lasting scent. Great lite product. Wear it with other scents. I just love this stuff! Fast and curtious service!</li>
    <li> I was so mad when degree discontinued this product. So glad I found somewhere to get some more. Thanks degree</li>
