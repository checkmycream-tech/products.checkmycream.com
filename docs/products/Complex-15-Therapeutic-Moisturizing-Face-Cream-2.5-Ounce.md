      <li>i searched this moisturizing cream over acne.org, and Im really glad that I tried this.</li>

      <li>Most moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried make my skin greasier or itchy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My friend said she uses this for her moisture cream and she loves it.  I wasnt  impressed at first...its watery, runny, and doesnt seem to do much of anything. She said to give it some time so I am using it in conjunction with another firming skin cream and now I think its alright. It IS unscented, so thats good...and it claims to hydrate skin molecules.  I also use Anew products from Avon which I think work well.</li>
    <li> Product was received very quickly and I have used it everyday since then and my face is in much better condition!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive, combination skin that is also prone to breakouts. I purchased this moisturizer a few weeks ago and so far I am satisfied. Complex 15 provides even coverage, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts, and doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor. It isn&#x27;t completely effective in combating my dry, winter skin, but I expect it to be a great moisturizer for the warmer months.</li>
    <li> It absorbs fast and evenly. I  just pad my face with a middle finger, that&#x27;s it.  5min after my skin is smooth and looks great. I use it after calic acid peel or shaving. Odorless, cheap, and works great. The best i ever had for ten good years of searching. Happy faces!!!!1</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a moisturizer that works, does not make me greasy, does not break me out, or irritate my eyes.  No perfume is a must. You will see an immediate difference. There are only two moisturizers that I use on my face now and around eyes: [[ASIN:B000052YMX Complex 15 Therapeutic Moisturizing Face Cream - 2.5 oz]] AND [[ASIN:B0086HZQWQ Charles of the Ritz Revenescence Liquid Re-created. NO SCENT]]The only all purpose moisturizer you need. For under your eyes too. The texture is so light but moisturizes like a heavy duty cream. ]Throw everything else away and simplify your life!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 25 years and absolutely love it.  It was first recommended to me by a nurse friend of mine when I was using Accutane for my severe acne and my skin was needing extra moisture.  It is a phospholipid which helps bring moisture up from below skin level, as I understand it.  It worked so well that I kept using it long after my acne was cleared up because it works so well.  I really like the fact that it absorbs very quickly and never clogs my pores.</li>
    <li> I used Retin-A for two days.  On day 3 I woke up with sandpaper for skin.  It was awful.  I had skin flaking off in my hands, big red patches...I looked like a snake when it sheds its skin.  I belonged in a circus.  I went to the pharmacy counter in tears and asked for help.  After the shock of my red splotchy, dry flaky skin wore off, the Pharmacist suggested Complex 15.  I had never heard of it.  But I was desperate.  I opened the tube as soon I got in my car and applied it.  By the time I got home (5 minutes drive) my skin was noticeably better.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing.  I&#x27;m well on my way for my face to have smooth skin again.  It&#x27;s inexpensive compared to the fancier brands and WORKS!</li>
    <li> Nothing else works for my sensitive skin. The perfect cream for me!</li>
    <li> I have used Complex 15 for at least 15 years and all of a sudden my pharmacy no longer carries it. Complex 15 moisturizer seems to melt into my skin..I use it 2xs a day and under anything else I may put on my face.</li>
    <li> I have finally found a product that doesn&#x27;t make my skin worse.  I&#x27;m always using prescription benzoyl peroxide to take care of my oily, acne-prone skin, but this leaves my skin dry, flaky, and red. Most moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried make my skin greasier or itchy. Then I found Complex 15 and, to my delight, it gave me baby-soft skin without any greasy residue.  The ingredients are minimal, which is really what my skin needs in order to heal. I&#x27;m very happy and will definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer; it is excellent for people who have eczema or extremely dry skin.  Highly recommended.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I picked this up since my daily Clinique moisturizer wasn&#x27;t working for me in the winter time.  I have clog-prone skin with some sensitivity. I cannot wear products with mineral oil at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say enough about this product! I wish I would have known about it years ago. My skin loves this stuff and is not breaking out - that&#x27;s a miracle in itself.  It&#x27;s fragrance-free which really is essential. I don&#x27;t understand why other companies continue to put fragrance in skin-care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This face cream is more of a rich lotion and it&#x27;s hypoallergenic, noncomedogenic and fragrance-free. It has what you need and doesn&#x27;t have what you don&#x27;t need. I hate to have to rave, but I think it&#x27;s perfect (for me at least). It plumps my skin and has properties that attract moisture and hold it in.  Over time it works even better and restores the delicate mantle of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, this is often recommended by dermatologists and now I know why. It&#x27;s a bland, yet highly effective face cream that really does what it says.</li>
    <li> Great lotion! Been using it for 20 years and it&#x27;s never been $50/tube! I know where to get it for much less... This highway robbery but the lotion is also worth it!</li>
    <li> i searched this moisturizing cream over acne.org, and Im really glad that I tried this. while im very reluctant to use any facial cream because my skin is hypersensitive and acne prone, this one gave no reason for me to be afraid.     it is very light, doesnt make me oily, doesnt irritate my skin, no annoying scent and doesnt break me out.     i love this product!</li>
    <li> My eyes sting with most lotions.  This one still stings if I get some in my eye, but not as bad as other brands.  It doesn&#x27;t make your face too oily either which is good.  I&#x27;ll prob buy more of this in the future.</li>
    <li> My infant daughter had dry skin on her face which was causing her to itch her face and make her very uncomfortable. Per advice from our pediatrician, we applied this cream on her face for a couple of days and the dryness on her skin vanished.</li>
    <li> The best daily moisturizer on the market and very hypoallergenic and non greasy.  I use a sunscreen moisturizer over it for daytime.</li>
    <li> In 1984 I was diagnosed with rosacea and this is the only moisturizer my face would tolerate and continues to be the only one I can use after all these years - my skin looks great - it really is the best.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on all of the positive reviews.  When first applying this \\&quot;cream,\\&quot; you immediately notice how runny it is.  It&#x27;s pretty much a liquid, not really what I was expecting.  Overall, the product does a fairly decent job of moisturizing my face, however I can&#x27;t help to wonder if a thicker formula would be more effective.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough great things about this moisturizer.  It is awesome!  I am 42, and have been using this product since I was 28 and was prescribed Accutane for cystic acne.  Now I get so many compliments on my skin, and I owe it all to this product.  People are always amazed when I tell them my age, and if they only knew how terrible my skin can really be if I didn&#x27;t use Complex 15.  It seems to be so calming to your skin.  I have told so many people about this product, and they all now are using it, too.  I couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> IF YOU HAVE ROSACEA, YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS PRODUCT.  I have tried EVERY product known to man (from $5 to $200)in an attempt to find something that does not make my face red and itchy.  This lotion is the only thing I have put on my skin in years that has zero adverse effects.  In addition, it is gentle enough to use around the eyes.  My boyfriend has started using the stuff in place of aftershave, and I am recommending it to all of my friends.  By the way, I have never posted a review of anything on the web, but had to comment.</li>
    <li> I have been using this face moisturizer for over 15 years.  I have tried other brands but always go back to Complex 15.  I love the light, almost lotion feel and the way it absorbs so quickly into the skin, and leaves it without the greasy feel so many other creams and lotions do.  I am 65 but many people tell me I look younger.  I know part of that is my genes (thanks, Mom!), but I also think the Complex 15 has done its share.</li>
    <li> My skin doctor recommended this face cream to me about 25 years ago.  His told me his own wife uses it all the time.  I had been buying it at Costco pharmancy but the last time I tried to buy it they were out. I have tried many expensive face creams but this works for me the very best at less than $5.00 a Tube. My skin is very sensitive and this cream is very gentle. I usually buy a dozen packages at a time and even give them as gifts.  Everyone loves this face cream.  I am sorry that I can no longer find it anywhere.  I am going to call Merck to see why they are not making it anymore.</li>
    <li> This is the only cream I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t irritate my face., It&#x27;s absolutely wonderful. Unfortunately, it has become very expensive, and if anything else worked, or if I could find it cheaper elsewhere, I would. But only Amazon seems to stock it, and, as I say, it works beautifully--so I&#x27;m sticking to it and just being as frugal as I can.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years - it was recommended by a very well know plastic surgeon that said \\&quot;save your money and don&#x27;t buy all those expensive moisturizers, this is best on the market\\&quot;, and I totally agree (after having tried the expensive ones!).  It&#x27;s so popular that it sells out as soon as it arrives at local drugstores.  I have combination, mature skin and I love this product. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Used it for years, hard to find so I buy thru Amazon. I never let my skin dry out, Complex 15 is all I use. I feel I&#x27;d shrivel up without it</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years.  It is a nice light facial moisturer for use daily under makeup. Not too oily, not too thick.</li>
    <li> Great cream. Too expensive these days to buy anymore. Light, smooth application and good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> great product. bought 20 of these right after they discontinued it but before word got out about it being discontinued. Awesome!</li>
    <li> This is the only Face Moisturizing Face Cream that I will use.  I can not find another product that comes close to it. It was recommended to me by a dermatologist. The price is great.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!!!  Just make sure you order it exactly as named on the box.  This company makes other Complex 15 products and it&#x27;s easy to order the wrong one!</li>
    <li> I am crazy about this lotion. I don&#x27;t know how I could have lived without it. My skin looks so much better which is great because I have very oily skin and most moisterizers make my face shiny but this stuff absorbes well and makes my skin smoother. I highly recommend this product-especially if you have oily acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for me.  My face felt dry within an hour.  I threw it away after the first use.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the reviews.  It burned a little which alarmed me and I didn&#x27;t wake up the next morning feeling moisturized.  Also some of the ingredients I think are carcinogenic the BHT etc.  I really wish cosmetic companies would not use such ingredients.</li>
    <li> Thirty some years ago my dermatologist told me to use this. I&#x27;ve been using it daily ever since. This order was for my thirty year old son. It is the ONLY moisturizer he uses.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! I have break out prone skin and this stuff doesn&#x27;t make me break out. It&#x27;s very light and non greasy and my skin got smoother after a couple weeks of use. Will continue to use this! It&#x27;s worth the high price.</li>
    <li> Suggested by my dermatologist.  Very light and does not clog pores.  Foundation goes on very well over this product.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My very expensive, private practice dermatologist recomended this to me.  I love it - greaseless, odorless, and absorbes quickly.  My doc said I could use the complex 15 lotion for my face to save money, but I prefer the face cream for my face and the lotion for everything else.  You will not regret this purchase and the price is very competitive!</li>
    <li> I have been using Complex 15 Moisturizing Face Cream for about 20 years, and, at age 60, I continue to have skin and complexion for which I receive compliments.  From my physician I first learned that this must be applied IMMEDIATELY after drying after a shower, and friends, both straight and gay, have repeatedly asked me how I maintain my skin in such good condition.  My answer is:  Complex 15, and LOTS of sun block.</li>
    <li> I have been searching my entire adult life for a moisturizer like this. I have rosacea and extremely sensitive skin, and this is the ONLY thing I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t cause any adverse reactions. I would love a version that contained sunscreen, because I have never found a sunscreen that I can use on my face (or maybe a tinted version), but I suspect that would ruin this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> The face cream came as promised and I was fully satisfied. My drug store had stopped carrying it and I was very happy to be able to find it on the web. No problems at all.</li>
    <li> This was Rx&#x27;d for me many years ago.. for dry skin but has no irritating oils.. feels like a normal washed face wit out the dry tight.  Holds water based moisture all the books tell one to use.  Hard to find.  No other like it.</li>
    <li> I use this cream for my face.  It softens without adding perfumes.  I&#x27;ve found nothing that compares.  Will continue to buy on line since I cannot find this in local pharmacies.</li>
    <li> I have always had sensitive skin that dries out extremely bad in the winter.  This is by far the best facial cream I&#x27;ve found.  It isn&#x27;t greasy or oily, and does an excellent job and moisturizing. It rivals the cream my dermatologist would sell except for 1/4 of the price and 4 times as much.  Great value, great product, definitely recommend at least giving it a try.</li>
    <li> I have used this for over 25 years morning and night.  At 79 my skin does not have the wrinkles that I see on my friends (some younger than me).  It is water based and does not clog your pores.</li>
    <li> I purchased this exact product a few years ago for $25.00 for a pack of 2.  why is the price so ridiculous now.  no way it is worth this much money</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for at least 35 years. It was recommended by my wonderful dermatologist at the time. It is a fraction of the cost of all those expensive creams. My skin feels terrific, smooth and dewy fresh. I am almost 62 and people think I look 10 years younger! I know genetics is involved, but this lotion couldn&#x27;t have hurt!!</li>
    <li> Good product too expensive</li>
    <li> Several years ago I had a reaction to latex (from dentist&#x27;s gloves).  My doctor told me to use Complex 15 for relief from burning &amp; itching.  I have been using it as my moisturizer ever since.  It costs much less than department store moisturizers and is just as good.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!  Cleared up my dry skin and acne.  This is the only thing that would work for me.  The Best!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years and it works for me.</li>
    <li> I have used Complex 15 for years. I usually use the lotion but can&#x27;t seem to find it anywhere. Comparing  between the 8oz. of lotion &amp; 2.5oz cream I will be going thru the cream quickly. This is the only product I can find that contains Phospholipids. This cream feels so light on &amp; keeps my face moistureised all day. It keeps my skin from breaking out with bleamishes. And it keeps my ecezma under contral better then any other product I have tried.</li>
    <li> I had allergies to many products and my dermatologist recommended Complex 15 for my face cream.  I was 50 years old at the time and I am now 76 and nobody can believe I,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m that age.  I believe that Complex 15 is part of the reason</li>
    <li> Wonderful, Non-Greasy, Light, Unscented Face Cream.</li>
    <li> Wow this stuff is garbage. I am so perplexed by all the great reviews. I have very fair, sensitive skin with mild/moderate acne. I have been looking for a good facial moisturizer for years and thought this would be my answer. Nope. It&#x27;s not a cream, it&#x27;s runnier than regular lotion and upon application it feels like a gel. After 10 minutes it feels like I put nothing on my face, in fact it makes my face feel a little tight. I look in the mirror and see dry patches. I am so disappointed, I just can&#x27;t trust reviews anymore. Only good thing about this product is that it has no fragrance and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using for a very Long time based on dr recommendation.  It appears it is being discontinued by mfr as it becomes harder to find each time I need more</li>
    <li> Non greasy, very hydrating, no film, best face lotion out there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. It is a great moisturizer, specifically for those who don&#x27;t like oils and fragrances. It has neither.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 20+ years- people tell me I look 10 yrs younger than I am. Excellent moisturizer- face &amp; body. Your skin will drink it &amp; feel hydrated.  If your skin is really thirsty you may need to use a bit more because it absorbs quickly. Not a wrinkle remover or cover.  Absolutly no smell to interfere with perfume or cologne. I&#x27;ve tried other lotions (some quite expensive), but always come back to C15. Not cheap, but worth the $.  Not found often in local drugstores.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Moisturizing face cream formulated for mild to severely dry skin\\&quot;.  I have fairly dry skin, and this doesn&#x27;t provide enough moisture.  It is non-greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> My facial skin is quite sensitive. I found this product through specialized medical website. I think it is quite good.</li>
    <li> It really is a good moisturizer BUT I wish that they didn&#x27;t put BHT in it as a preservative. I am always looking for creams that are paraben free and I saw that this was..HOWEVER is has BHT in it which in some studies found is a carcinogen..So unfortunately I will not be re-ordering this due to that. Otherwise, it is a good sensitive skin moisturizer.</li>
    <li> So sad it is discontinued.</li>
    <li> Have used this prdouct for yrs and wonderful skin moisturizer....a good price and wish they would make some with SPF in it...</li>
    <li> I have used the complex 15 lotion so thought I would give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;I feels very nice going on. I use it after my shower at night and my face is never dry.</li>
    <li> Have used it for years!  Swear by it.  Hard to find. Target stores will special order it for you--through the Pharmacy.</li>
    <li> Great product for skin care; my mother has been using this product for 30 years, she&#x27;s 89 and looks  29!</li>
    <li> Just the best, you don&#x27;t need to use toner this does a two for one job.  Using it for decades now.  I&#x27;ve tried other stuff but this is what I keep going back to.</li>
    <li> this is the best Moisturizer I used. it Moisturizes the skin with out changing the color or giving it an oily look, its pretty cheap and a little goes a long way I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Every moisturizer usually gives me acne, but this stuff doesn&#x27;t. Not oily or greasy. Great for people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This was not for me. It caused me more breakouts and made my rosacea flare up even more. It does work nice on the neck area but no miracle product.</li>
    <li> A MUST BUY! I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR 20 YEARS. IT&#x27;S PERFECT TO USE UNDER YOUR MAKE UP EVERYDAY. IT&#x27;S LIGHT ENOUGH, BUT JUST ENOUGH, SO YOUR FACE FEELS SMOOTH. I&#x27;M 51 AND PEOPLE ASK WHAT MY SECRET IS TO LOOKING YOUNGER. THIS PRODUCT REALLY HELPS YOUR FACE FEEL FRESH AND JUST A DAB WILL DO IT. IT DRIES QUICKLY, SO YOU DON&#x27;T HAVE TO WAIT LONG BEFORE YOU CAN APPLY YOUR MAKE UP! GREAT BASE TO WEAR FOR ANY SEASON OF THE YEAR - 5 STARS!</li>
    <li> Trumps all of the expensive facial creams. My husband and I can&#x27;t live without it. Works great for multiple skin types - normal as well as dry.</li>
    <li> I have super dry skin and I&#x27;ve really tried everything.  I happened to just find complex 15 and it is amazing! no more dryness or flakes :) yippy</li>
    <li> Complex 15 is great on my dry skin, rosacea, and never feels greasy.. Goes on easily and absorbs well so no tackiness or stickiness..  I use on my neck area too.  Hard to find in the stores so it is great that I can get it here.</li>
    <li> I have used this product on and off since the mid-1980s.  Most moisturizers break me out; this one does not.  Complex 15 is non-greasy, doesn&#x27;t contain harmful chemicals and supplies just the right amount of moisture for my combination skin.</li>
    <li> This is a very disappointing product. I have rather dry skin, nothing out of the ordinary. This product turned out to be not good at all. I have to use a lot of it, it has a very very watery consistence (no cream), and does NOT hydrate..just mildly. It doesn&#x27;t leave my complexion feeling good. It feels kind of dry, even after using it often and generously. I advise against it if you are looking for a good moisturizer. This isn&#x27;t it. Other than that, it is not allergenic (good!), and the shipping was timely, and condition upon arrival good.</li>
    <li> I love it. For some reason it has been dificult to fine Thanks for still carrying it</li>
    <li> The most soothing face cream; goes under anything else you might use.  It used to be dispensed only by skin doctors, wonderful to have it available.  Try it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 30 years and I would never want to be without it. Moisturizing but not at all greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of moisturizing face cream and this is by far the best for dry skin on yr face. I have dry, flaky skin on the nose, corners of the lips and middle of my forehead. I used many expensive branded face cream and none of them helped keeping it moisturized. After using this, i don&#x27;t have this problem anymore and i used it only twice a day (morning and before bed). It is also very affordable.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent daytime cream.  I have Rosacea so when I can find a product that works well I am thrilled!  And I am thrilled with this!! :):)</li>
    <li> I have the most sensitive skin on my face, right now and needed some moisture without the sting. This is a fragrance-free cream, but really not  rich enough for me in the winter months. I use olivella oil underneath, which helps a lot.</li>
    <li> I dont know how i survived so long without this cream! I have combination skin (a very oily t-zone and dry cheeks) and Complex 15 balances everything out. It sinks right, and almost feels like I&#x27;m giving my face a drink of water...my oily t-zone is controlled and my entire face is baby soft. I still have bottles of expensive cream in my cabinet that I wont go near...I&#x27;ll be a Complex 15 girl for life. TRY THIS STUFF!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 30 years.  I am now 85 years old and have extremely dry, itchy skin.  I have used moisturizes on my face  from very expensive to this product and this is the only one that I can tolerate. It does not make my skin oily, nor do I suffer from skin eruptions when using it.  I have no idea what to do now that the product is no longer available in the U.S.  I wish I had a friend in Canada.</li>
    <li> 1~2 years ago the 3 pack of this sold for $15-18. Right now it&#x27;s almost $30!!! I understand it&#x27;s supply and demand but some of these sellers are being so greedy. Thankfully I bought 3 more of this recently while a single tube sold for ~$5.50 but I think I need to look somewhere else now to buy these..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, I&#x27;ve been recommending it to everyone really. It was a little drying the winter, but it&#x27;s perfect for the summer under make up and to use before using a hydrating gel cream or those essence sheet masks in the evening.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. I purchased this after reading many positive reviews...and I&#x27;m glad I did. I have very sensitive skin and hormonal acne so I have literally tried EVERYTHING under the sun for my face. This is a light, gentle mositurizer and it has not made me break out. I will say it&#x27;s a little &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; for the winter and it does not have an SPF (which would be a bonus) but I am happy with it and will continue to use. Super fast shipping, too. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I do like this face cream. It does not have perfume. The consistency is watery and my skin absorbs it quickly.  However, on those days when my skin got very dry, I found it to be not moisturizing enough. I recommend it for the summer use. For winter, it depends on your skin. If your skin tends to be very dry, then you may want to find something else.</li>
    <li> While this is a good moisturizer, it did not help my rosacea. If you have acne rosacea then this is so so if your skin is anything like mine.</li>
    <li> Perfect base lotion complex15 is a great product for me because i need some base lotion to add some of my own therapeutic essential oils and create a fantastic facial lotion. In fact i like this even plain, mellow and clean.</li>
    <li> I have use this cream for many years and always come back and buy again and again! is simple and good for my skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that my husband, son and I use.  It&#x27;s an especially good moisturizer for those who have acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> I was having trouble finding a face lotion that was light and didn’t feel greasy. I also have rosacea. I found this online and it does the job. This is my second tube.</li>
    <li> I depend on this cream. It feels good on my face. I like everything about it, but now I my store can&#x27;t order it. I think the company changed hands. I hope they will continue to market it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS MOISTERIZER ... LIVE IN ARIZONA AND THIS IS HELPING TO KEEP THOSE NASTY WRINKLES AT BAY!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t understand the reviews or hype around this product at all... I have dry, not extremely dry but yes I have dry skin. I used this for 4 days and really??? As soon as I went back to my other moisturizer my skin FINALLY looked hydrated... I had to put on 4 layers just to get that plump feeling. Really I dont get it at all! Worth trying since there are so many good reviews, but really, not hydrating..</li>
    <li> This is a great face cream for anyone with dry sensitive skin. Moisturizes my face without leaving dry or without making too oily.</li>
    <li> I thought the price of $71.99 was for a case (at least 10).  This is a product that usually retails for $5.99-7.99.  While I love this product and have used it for 30 years, I will not pay more than $10 per tube.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Have used it for years.  It is light, non-sticky, and absorbs quickly.  Really moisturizes my face and neck without that heavy, sticky feeling.  I&#x27;m devastated that it is no longer being manufactured.</li>
    <li> It does what it says.</li>
    <li> This product is really great! The dermatologist told me about it. I like to order it online because the only store that sells it is K-Mart, and the one near me doesn&#x27;t sell it, but they can order if from one of their other stores and get it sent to the one near me. It really moisturizes well!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001EJOPXE Complex 15 Therapeutic Moisturizing Face Cream - 2.5 oz (Pack of 3)]]I have used this complex 15 for over 10 years. great product.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin as well as rosacea (the kind that makes you look like you have acne and skin is bumpy). I heard about this face cream through a rosacea board and thought I would give it a try. The first night I tried it, I fell in love. I woke up and my skin felt less bumpy. It&#x27;s so light weight, not greasy, no fragrance, non-comedogenic. I have been using this in conjuntion with Aquanil face cleanser and the duo has been amazing so far.  I was using Burts Bees Sensitive line before. I will be buying this again and again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that it is sulfate &amp; paraben free!</li>
    <li> I like this lotion. It is lightweight has a barely detectable scent. It feels good on my skin. If it is applied lightly, there is little to no greasy residue.</li>
    <li> This product is great, it leaves your skin soft without looking or feeling greasy. I have very sensitive skin and have not had a single issue with this product. With daily use this bottle will last a little less than a year.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately Complex 15 makes my adult, acne prone skin break out. I have tried it a couple of times because of the positive reviews but, quite unfortunately, this does not work for me.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing really bad about this product. All I can say is that I&#x27;m one of those product jumpers - I&#x27;ve tried lots of moisturizers. I was hoping this would lessen my acne because would be a cleaner option. No such luck. I&#x27;m now using Neutrogena Compete Acne Solution. I love that one. I also like the Aveno Radiance one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this doesn&#x27;t promise acne curing. I was just hoping this would be a cleaner option. 3 stars because it is nothing special.</li>
