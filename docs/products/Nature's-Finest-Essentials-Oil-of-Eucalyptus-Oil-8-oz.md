    <li> Helps ease pain in my arthritic hand. Not a cure all but it does help. A small sprits goes a long way. Mild odor but not offensive and for the first minut or two its a bit oily but after that its fine. My wife also had me put some on her itcy back and it also helped with that.</li>
    <li> About 7 years ago, my family and I were in Nashville, TN and I pulled a muscle in my back.  I could barely move and was in a lot of pain.  We stopped by a kiosk selling this oil because the sign said PAIN RELIEF.  A lady sprayed some of this oil on my back and I instantly noticed a difference.  I could move and my pain started to leave.  After a few hours, I could barely tell that I had been miserable before.  It worked much better than the muscle relaxer pills that I had been prescribed.  Any time I go out of town, I make sure I take a small bottle of this, just in case.  Love this oil!</li>
    <li> Best topical pain reliever I  have ever used.  I have had  a successful experience using it.  Took away my aches and pain immediately.  Only takes a small amount.  Excellent with a heating pad.  Very  very  pleased.</li>
    <li> Love this product...great for muscle pain and better than taking pain meds! This product is the only thing that works for me on my lower back and leg pains.</li>
    <li> I suffer from minor muscle aches.  This product provides wonderful relief for those minor aches and pains.  I&#x27;ve recommended it to family and friends and have also given it as a gift.</li>
    <li> I purchased O&#x27;Reily&#x27;s Rapid Relief prior to this purchase and it worked great. I tried this product and it did not work that well and the smell was something other tham Eucalyptus oil it smells rancid.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  I was first introduced to it when I injured my hand - my brother-in-law had purchased this product and I simply sprayed it on the injured area several time that evening - by morning the pain and discomfort were completely gone.  Since then I have keep the Nature&#x27;s Finest handy for sore muscles, sprains, insect bites &amp; stings.  I have shared this product with friends who have had painful injuries and they are amazed at the relief they receive from this topical spray.  I recently shared this product with  a close friend who suffers from painful arthritus - she says that within 15 minutes of simply spraying the product on her painful area  (you don&#x27;t even have to \\&quot;rub it in\\&quot;) her pain is gone - she is 85 years old nad also loves this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. I will buy again. It works too. I like it.</li>
    <li> It says don&#x27;t use if pregnant. I used this during both my pregnancies for swelling in my legs and ankels. This stuff was amazing!! Over night while I slept this stuff works. I would wake up and my swelling was gone.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it is very good for aches and pains., it has little or no odor like some other products.  My neice suggested it to me and I found it to be everything she said it was.  I get a lot of relief from pain with this oil.</li>
    <li> Works well for pulled muscles,  low back pain,  Highly recommend product for anyone.  Will order again from this source.  Very efficient process.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 5 years and am reordering again.  This is fabulous stuff. It helps muscle pain to get better.  Rub it all around your wrist, and the pain is gone in about 10 minutes.  Can be used anywhere else too.  I use it as a personal lubricant, and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil in July of 2012 from a kiosk in a Nashville mall. I decided to write a review after i started having some kind of spasms in my lower back last night. Everytime i tried to bend over, squat or even lift anything, the pain would move or spread. I sprayed some oil on my back and trouble went away after 10 minutes or so. I couldn&#x27;t believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this spray on my fiance&#x27;s arm/wrist. He suffers from a carpal tunnel-like pain. I also use it on my daughter who suffers from asthma. I spray it on her back/chest then spray a little on a cotton swab and let her sniff (inhale) the eucalyptus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this spray about 20-25 times since i&#x27;ve bought it and still have 3/4ths left.</li>
    <li> This oil is awesome for aches and pains.  I rub it on the area and really feel relief pretty quickly.  This was recommended by a friend in another state and of course no one in my area carried it in their stores.  Amazon to the rescue.  Great price and amazon service means you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I bought two bottles of this many years ago at a mall kiosk and still have half a bottle left.  This oil is truly amazing!

I love the smell of it and it works really well!  The bottles last forever because you only use a few spritz&#x27;s.  I also like that it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily.  I recommend this oil for everyone!</li>
    <li> Great product wife uses this all the time.  We use it for when feel a headache coming on place some under your nose on upper lip and helps to relieve headache fast in our opinion.  We also use it on sore muscles and seems to help.  Like and would recommned.</li>
