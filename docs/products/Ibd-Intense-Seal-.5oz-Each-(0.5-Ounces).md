      <li>and very easy to apply.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> live it and fast delivery</li>
    <li> Never chips or need to be cleaned after application. Works well with any other bail product and goes on smoothly. The shine last for weeks!</li>
    <li> nothing special about this product at all . It compares to all the other products that is listed in conjuction to use with all the other products out there</li>
    <li> This product cracks after being in regular nail polish for only 2 hours. Even when following consistent directions</li>
    <li> WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE KNOWS, even tho the product info and insructions state on the product that it is for acrylic AND GELS, it actully does not work with SOAK OFF gel products and polish. nail polish and soak off gels are more flexible than the intense seal, so it will crack and peel off  and peel your polish right off. I used it on a client after applying soak off gels, and it peeled by next day.&lt;br /&gt;i want the company to make sure this info is put on official product descriptions and instructions.. grrrr</li>
    <li> IBD Intense Seal does what it says on the package (mostly).  It applies like polish over filed acrylic or cured gel and then cures in the gel lamp.  IBD Intense Seal is a little runnier than Brisa Gloss topcoat, but they&#x27;re otherwise very similar in application and curing and you don&#x27;t have to remove the inhibition layer after IBD Intense Seal.  They both have that purple fluorescence that is always cool if you go anywhere with black lights.  This product will NOT soak off with acetone, so you have to file the nail enhancement to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with this product is that it is brittle.  You CAN&#x27;T apply it over polish on natural nails (to protect them from polish remover) because the flex of the natural nails will have it crack off.  (If you must protect polish on natural nails from chemicals, I would recommend CND Shellac topcoat instead.)  IBD Intense Seal will crack off of anything flexible (including too-thin gel or wraps) and after a few days I notice small chips off the sealed free edge of my acrylics.  I just smooth the edge of the chip with a file and it wears fine afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I don&#x27;t use Intense Seal on myself any more... I prefer IBD clear gel instead to seal my acrylics because it&#x27;s not brittle and doesn&#x27;t chip, but it doesn&#x27;t feel totally slick like Intense Seal feels.  So I still use Intense Seal sometimes on clients for convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in summary, if you want to seal acrylic nails, this stuff applies very easily, cures in 2-3 minutes depending on your gel lamp, doesn&#x27;t need leave an inhibition layer, and stays shiny for weeks.  You need a gel lamp to cure it and you have to file it off to remove or fill.  It won&#x27;t work for anything less rigid than acrylic because it&#x27;s a little brittle.</li>
    <li> I love this product, they used it at the nail salon that I used to go to and my nails always came at very glossy and it held nail art well too. Since I&#x27;ve gone the cheaper route of doing my own nails now-a-days, I only purchase this product for use on my acrylics. Its a little on the expensive side but well worth the cost. A great investment indeed.</li>
    <li> I really love this product, It goes on smooth and the best past is u dont have to clean a tacky layer how cool is that.. The only thing is is filing off the seal but I personally would go thru the extra work for a fantastic product like this one.</li>
    <li> This is a good product if you want to change your polish frequently.  My polish chipped right away when I used this and other products last over a week.  I will only use in a pinch.</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED THIS TO DO NAILS AT HOME FOR MY DAUGHTER AND ME, WORKS EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED AND HOLDS UP GREAT. WILL DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Not using gels anymore</li>
    <li> Started off good, but after 3 days I noticed it was leaving these lil hard pieces all over the nails. So I put a wooden struck inside to stir, it was all globbed up n nasty. Basically wasted my money</li>
    <li> all you need is very little of this, because if you put a lot, you will bubbles under the light (uv light) but is good stuff and price is good.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect top coat for a gel manicure! Super shiny and strong. I&#x27;ve already told quite a few people that they must get this product!</li>
    <li> I love this sealer!  It&#x27;s the perfect finishing touch for fabulous nails.  It keeps the nails looking shiny and glossy all the while keeping it protected.  Highly recommended for finishing off gel nails.</li>
    <li> this product was used on me at a nail salon and i loved it so i decided to buy it... when it was used at salon i got a great shiny finish and my tips were so bright white but when i used it at home the second i pulled my hand out of uv dryer my tips were yellow and i have no idea what went wrong, that has never happened to me before. i don&#x27;t know if i got a faulty product or what but i did everything the way i was suppose to do to my knowledge...please help me out if anyone knows how to fix the problem, i have read some great reviews about ibd intense seal and i want it to work that way for me.</li>
    <li> Love the product and delivery time</li>
    <li> I AM PLEASE WITH MY PRODUCT &amp; I RECEIVED THE PRODUCT QUICK. I WILL BE ORDERING FROM THE SUPLLIER AGAIN.</li>
    <li> OMG Amazing!!!! I use to have my nails done every other week. After discovering this product in &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34;, I now go either once a month or after 3 weeks. It is great and so easy to use. You do need a UV lamp, which I had; but the product I purchased then was horrible and did not work. I took a chance with IBD and WOW....in a few minutes my nails looked freshly done and mirror shine.</li>
    <li> Really great top coat. Seller was also great.  Product arrived as promised and packaging was very good.</li>
    <li> 😍I have been looking for this particular gel since the nail supply store in my town closed. I have not been able to find it except on here. It was the same price as it was in the store too. Loveeeee it!💕💕will order every time I need it. Oh and it came very very fast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since last July.  I ordered it after reading multiple reviews.  I&#x27;ve not been disappointed.  Adds a beautiful shine and a great base for nail polish, since I use it as the last step in my gel overlays before polishing.</li>
    <li> Bubbles, always these bubbles! :-(</li>
    <li> Very good.... makes your nails look very glossy.  Dries quickly with UV light in under a minute and half.  Awesome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;v tried this product about twice already and I really like it. It worked great and gave a nice, shiny finish look.</li>
    <li> Had hard time finding this works great!</li>
    <li> I have uesed this for about two months now, and it is awesome!  I use it over hard gel.&lt;br /&gt;I am not a professional, however, after my nail is built, I sometimes use gel polish on them.  I use this over the gel polish and have had zero problems.  Fantastic stuff!</li>
    <li> Love this top coat. The product arrived quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> The brush is terrible! waste of money coz now I have to use a different brush each time I need to use it which is very frustrating! I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money!</li>
    <li> good, but not what I thought it was</li>
    <li> I really hate that I ordered this product. I cured it under my UV lamp for even a few seconds, looks great but the next day it cracks and just looks horrible. I wont be buying this product anymore.</li>
    <li> Strong and amazing. Just deal with intense odor, and you are golden.</li>
    <li> It might be just the light I have or might be the product. I&#x27;m not a professional nail tech, so it&#x27;s probably my light...just sayin. It does have a nice shine to it though and goes on very nicely. Took about 6 minutes to cure without being sticky.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice any deference from a clear coat.  No metal ball inside to shake it up and it needs to be mixed for the mirror like shine.</li>
    <li> I am thinking this is not the original one as it cracks in a couple of days and that has never happened to me before I am a nail technician and have used this product always but this ones I bought here are not the same.</li>
    <li> I like it but i wouldnt buy it again. The NSI glaze n go is a little better for close to the same price. It isnt a bad product just not the best. Fast delivery and great customer service</li>
    <li> works great, stays shiney</li>
    <li> I have to say I&#x27;m pretty picky, so it says it all when I tell you this product is amazing! Imagine a shiny clear glaze that protects your nail from water, stains etc. - that&#x27;s what it is. After I do my acrylics I put it on, cure in an LED light for one minute, and they last for days and days. I paint over it whatever color I want. And unlike gel clear coats, there&#x27;s no cleansing with this - it dries super glossy, and strong! And the odor is not nearly like a typical gel polish. You can clean the polish off with pure acetone and this glaze won&#x27;t come off. When I want to remove it I either soak it off like a gel polish or I file it away. It is one of the best products I&#x27;ve found and a staple in my stash. A must!</li>
    <li> Love that it takes the stickiness from the gel, leaves the nail shiny. The only thing is that you have to cure it for a long time, other than that it&#x27;s perfect</li>
    <li> Just as described.  Highly recommended product and seller</li>
    <li> I really hate that I ordered this product. Looks great but the next day it cracks and just looks horrible. I wont be buying this product anymore.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great... The shine is amazing &amp; the coat is so strong &amp; durable that it actually puts a permanent seal over the acrylic. I gave it 4 stars because sometimes I end up with little bubble like dips in the finish... It may be because I&#x27;m not putting enough on my nail, but I&#x27;ve noticed that when I use to much it will pool &amp; make kind of a ramp by my cuticle area &amp; I am trying to avoid this from happening because once the nail starts growing it sticks out &amp; has to be filed down. When I try to take a nail off with the 100% acetone &amp; aluminum foil wrap, if I don&#x27;t file this off, it protects the nail from the acetone (I found this out the hard way) it keeps it intact wherever there&#x27;s coverage... Love it &amp; will keep using it &amp; try to figure out the application process more with use.</li>
    <li> I received this product before the date it was suppose to arrive. It was leaking when i opened the box because the cap wasnt screwed on tight enough. I cleaned it off and it works just fine. Leaves a great shine and will only dry under a uv lamp. Great product for the price. Its way more expensive at sally&#x27;s beauty supply. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Ive been doing nails for 11 years and have been using this product off and on thruout the years.. it used to be ok.. now it sucks.. bad batch after bad batch.. this company doesnt even have a phone number. heat spikes and chipping galore, even if you have the client NOT wash their hands. I read a review on here earlier that said not for gel polish.. well no crap yo, you have to use gel polish top coat, regardless the brand of gel polish your using.. cant use a sealer gel on gel polish.. i swear, some people shouldnt be in this profession if they have to find out on amazon reviews that sealer gel doesnt work on gel polish.. this product is for finishing acrylic, gel, silk.. etc.. enhancements, more or less... gel polish is is a mix of gel and nail polish.. shellac, gelish.. all those crappy brands.. if you want a gel thats going to last, never yellow, never spike, or fade.. gel polish, or a finish topcoat.. Young Nails.. THats all i GOt to say.. except all you amateurs trying to do nails, trying to use a sealer as a gel polish topcoat, thinking shellac , opi, or gelish is the bomb.. find somehtin else to do, youre just gettin in the way.</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks! Three minutes under my UV light and my nails are rock hard! I&#x27;m using with the IBD introductory gel kit. Perfect combination!</li>
    <li> Nice hard shiny top coat. Apply VERY thin or you will get bubbles etc...... stays shiny though and nice looking.</li>
    <li> Gives your Acrylic nails that extra shine. I love the fact that you do not have to clean the nails after you cure them in the uv lamp.</li>
    <li> I find I really don&#x27;t need this product.</li>
    <li> Product was dried out and broken when I received it. I suggest you order it from somewhere else.  ****edit: Seller sent me a new product and it works perfectly fine with most gel polishes</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE super shine! Dries under UV lamp quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Came when it said it would.&lt;br /&gt;brand new sealed in box.</li>
    <li> If you have gel, acrylic, or gel polish nails, this is a must buy! Long lasting shine and great seal!</li>
    <li> Excellent service.super fast.good product.</li>
    <li> Also cures with led lamp. No need to clean the sticky layer that other top coats leave ! I love it and I definitely recommend</li>
    <li> THIS UV TOP COAT SUCKS! IT CRACKS THE NEXT DAY WHY ARE OTHER WOMEN GIVING THIS PRODUCT 5 STARS??? I PAID $8 AND DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT! WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY! I WILL BUY THE GELISH TOP COAT I HEAR IT WORKS AND DOES NOT CRACK, I LOVE IBD PRODUCTS BUT THIS ONE IS AWFUL!</li>
    <li> Ill start of by saying that for the price, its OK. It gives nails an awesome shine so i did love that, it cures pretty fast. BUT if you are anything like me and love to pick at your nails or play with them, be aware, this WILL break and chip. it not removable with nail polish remover, you might have to file off, and use acetone after. It has a strong smell however not unpleasant very similar to acrylic liquid. good amount. and very easy to apply.</li>
    <li> If your someone like me who works with there hands always washing them and everytime you get ur nails done a couple days later they start chipping this is a life saver for me  it has extend the life of my nail design and saved some bucks in my pockets. I put it on as soon as Iget my nails done and touch it up a week later FYI you have to have a UV lamp to dry this.</li>
    <li> this product on the very moment you finish applying over the nails looks very sharp, but once it is been on for a good few minutes, it cracks right away.  Never to buy it again, I&#x27;ll keep using the shelac instead, lot better product.</li>
    <li> Well, this does cut down on the time you would normally spend buffing nails, that is a good thing.  However, it doesn&#x27;t eliminate the need to do a bit of filing to even out the nail. You also need to use sparingly or it will create a ridge at the base of the nail, by the cuticle, that is as obvious as a poor filing job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had one manicurist that tried using it over the top of polish, which had a nice end look, but the polish chipped within a few days and I had to file off the rest of the polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use the product.</li>
    <li> makes your nails &#x27;purple.&#x27;</li>
    <li> Love this, great shine. I think this hives the nails the finish you need. lasts long too. Must have !</li>
    <li> I ,love love love this product Its a very good product.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite no-cleanse uv top coat, have had the best success with it by far. The IBD soak offs have been the best polish gel soak off that is have found and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
    <li> I purchased an IBD professional gel kits and the seal in the package doesn&#x27;t work, so I bought this instead. It works perfectly. It drys very fast too. (ONLY 3 MINS in my UV light dryer)</li>
    <li> It takes a few applications to figure out what works best, I apply a very thin coat over the color gel before the top coat to really seal the gel polish &amp; create a hard gel. At first it cracked alot in a short period of time, now the cracking is very minimal &amp; fine. Will continue the search for a preferred sealer.</li>
    <li> Great Topcoat, but only to be used on acrylics and gels. Does not come off with nail polish remover. Dont use on natural nails. Other than that its a great product.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product! It chips within a few days of applying. Defeneatly a waste of money</li>
    <li> I live in super hot and sunny Alabama, and I use this product to stop the sun from yellowing my gel nails. If I don&#x27;t use it my nails go completly yellow in between fills, this slows down the process but doesnt stop it completly. The only time my nails see the sun is while driving, or working-out outside, but thats all it takes.</li>
    <li> It leaks so I would be very careful with this product make sure its standing up right ( standing like in the pic of it when you store it ) and not laying on its side or it will leak and I would say to expect it to have leaked when you received it but its half the price than the stores so yeah I&#x27;m grateful!</li>
    <li> it is too rigid... in less than a day my Mani is all cracked up.</li>
    <li> WAY BETTER THAN EXPECTED!!!! I will definately be using this product from now on.</li>
    <li> Fantastic, always have shiny nails.</li>
    <li> Item received vey fast which made me happy since I was so ready to see how it works . everything came in good condition now just ready to go home and try it out woohooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> For its best use with regular polish. Do 2 coats of regular polish LET IT DRY. Minimum 24 hours then apply one coat of gel. I prefer 2 cure under uv light then apply the intense seal</li>
    <li> I love this sealer because it is high gloss finish. And does not require you to wipe it off with alcohol l like others do. It DOES however need a UV lamp to cure for approx 1 min. It was packed well and shipped quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I had purchased it from sallys befor for a much higher price and absolutely loved it so I was super excited to find it on here at a much lower price for the same great quality product. The only problem is that I had only used it on acrylics and I tried it over my gel polish when I received it and it cracked bt other than that its a great nom yellowing top coat. It makes my nails extremely shiny wich I love and I heard from others who use this product that it doesnt crack over their gels so maybe i did somethin wrong so I will def be trying it again. I was also extremely happy at how fast I received my product and I will continue to purchase this product from them:)</li>
    <li> Great stuff, I really like it.</li>
    <li> It says you don&#x27;t have to use a uv lamp but you do or it won&#x27;t dry it leaves it sticky</li>
    <li> works very well... love  the shine and quality of this  product...wil buy again when im ready for another full order</li>
    <li> Works amazingly great</li>
    <li> This is a very good product and truly makes your nails look great and last for long periods of times.</li>
    <li> Love how shiny it leaves your nails!!</li>
    <li> This is amazing  !!!!  I&#x27;m a nail technician and this is totally worth itales your nails look shiny like glass !</li>
    <li> Love love loved this product better than the one I purchased at sallys....looks twice as shiny and cheaper than other products. ...I will definitely buy this again</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous about buying this sealer but I&#x27;m so happy I did. I used it when I did my acrylic nails and the seal was great with a nice shine. Best thing about it. NO STICKY RESIDUE! After it is cured under the lamp.</li>
    <li> As a nail technician I would say this item is very shiny once you put on your nails or on top of a rhinestone, but it crack easily, and hard to soak off. I will not purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> Use for your gel nails</li>
    <li> Love this sealer. Seals gel polish completely with a brilliant shine. IBD products are a proven staple for me. Usually buy two at a time. I have one open right now and one unopened waiting for when the first one is all gone. That&#x27;s how much I like this product.</li>
    <li> Even my old salon uses this product. I love it. I tried another product once, and was disappointed. This is the one to go with.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Its the BEST UV Top Coat. The shine last on my nails a long time. I just love it... OXOX</li>
    <li> it arrived on time that is the only thing good i can say about this. it does not work well at all it stays gooey no matter what you do</li>
    <li> I love this seal it is so great putting on nail polish of any kind. it makes sparkle nail poslish sparkle way more. I always get complements on this.</li>
    <li> Has a VERY strong odor and chips off very quickly. Did my nails last night and this top coat has chipped off in huge chunks and the tips of my nails have already worn down to the bare nail. Thought I&#x27;d like this product but not a fan at all after wasting my time doing them and getting the results of a typical manicure with regular polish. I normally use Gelish, Red Carpet, or Orly and have never experienced this issue with those products.&lt;br /&gt;**Note, I&#x27;ve been doing UV polish for almost two years and am well experienced with the process.</li>
    <li> Works great with the other ibd products</li>
    <li> Just like it says on the bottle, it gives your nails a nice mirror like shine. Very good price too!</li>
    <li> I gave it 5 star just because it got to me so fast, not got to use it yet but it came in great shape.</li>
    <li> Perfect and just what I needed!</li>
    <li> I really like this gel top coat seal. It makes your nail look like glass. Very pretty i like ok</li>
    <li> it dried up ,don&#x27;t waste ur money I had it in a dark place and when I went to use it ,it was dried out like gum terrible buyers beware</li>
    <li> Alone on polish its ok but it can chip. With a gel polish less chance of cracking but still happened. Cure time is fast you don&#x27;t need anything but a uv/led light and it doesn&#x27;t have to be one that cost over $100. Under black light glows a bit.</li>
    <li> Love... No after stickiness complete sealed polished shiny look</li>
    <li> Nice product,fast shipping!!!Thanks))</li>
    <li> Good product, good price, quick shipment</li>
    <li> Very nice and glossy finisg</li>
    <li> Package arrived in a very timely manner and was packaged nicely. I haven&#x27;t used this product yet, only because I am letting my nails take a break from acrylics.  I have read many reviews on this product, which prompted me to purchase it. Based on other reviews I have read, I&#x27;m sure I will enjoy this product. Will give another review after I have used it.  As far as the seller goes, I had absolutely no problems at all. Like I said, it was packaged nicely and arrived before the EDD.  I would give 5 stars but seeing how I haven&#x27;t used it yet, I will refrain from doing so. Would definitely order again from the same seller though!</li>
    <li> I like this top coat.  Is very shiny and resistant. I will buy it again once is finished. Is also great on top of gel polish</li>
    <li> This stuff chipped and shattered and pieces broke off leaving jagged edges everywhere.  Perhaps I&#x27;m not experienced enough to get this applied right and lit up correctly or something but it just didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  The Avon top coat I was using before hardened and shined and stayed 100times better than this</li>
    <li> It was brand new in the box and it came really fast. I use this all the time. I will order more in the future</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many top coats. This one is professional and it&#x27;s my absolute favorite! Got here quick... And you don&#x27;t have to even use cleanser after you dry it because is non-cleansing which saves me money on having to buy that too. Love!!</li>
    <li> Dries fast and shiny without a tacky layer.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff !! I use it all the time on my clients !!! Its gives excellent shine !!! Way cheaper on here then at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply House !!!</li>
    <li> ibd knows how to make Gel shine with the intense seal.  This stuff is awesomely easy to apply and makes fresh gel nails shine like wet paint.  This stuff is a must have in your nail kit.</li>
    <li> We use this intense sealer at cosmetology school! It&#x27;s even better on your regular nails as well. You will need a curing led 45 watt lamp.</li>
    <li> BEST PRODUCT EVER! fast arrival, brand new, love this item!</li>
    <li> This product is by far the best one I bought. Using it to seal acrylic or gel layered nails. It evens out and corrects at the end.</li>
    <li> I tried 2 times the product and after 2 to 3 days it cracks, I use another top coat much cheaper and it shines much and does not crack ...</li>
    <li> This product goes on just like nail polish, there is no guey residue after applying it  and I have worn this withhout a topcoat after I&#x27;ve done a french manicure gel tips and the shine holds up nicely.</li>
    <li> Love it! Makes my at home nail job look professional. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  It leaves a very durable high shine finish on nails with gel overlays, gel polishes, acrylic nails, and gel nails.  I imagine it would also perform exceptionally well over silk and fiberglass wraps, but I haven&#x27;t used it for that yet.  I have replaced my UV Top Coat with this product since it requires no clean up or buffing after curing.  I do not, however, recommend using it on natural nails.  I gave it a shot to test it out since I&#x27;d heard good and bad on it&#x27;s performance on natural nails.  It flakes off on the free edge of the nail very easily with natural nails.  I haven&#x27;t had that problem with my gel overlays or my mother&#x27;s acrylic and gel nails.  What I love best about this product is that it protects my manicure very well from acetone during polish removals and clean up.  I use the soak off method to remove stubborn glitter polishes and so far this product has stood up to the abuse perfectly.  It&#x27;s a major game changer for a polish addict like me.  The only thing I would add is that it is detrimentally important to wrap the free edge of the nail during application.  It will flake off and chip every time if you forget or don&#x27;t properly get the entire free edge.  I also recommend curing for 4 minutes under a UV light instead of the recommended 3 minutes.  It seams to seal a bit stronger with that extra minute of curing time.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than the one in sally&#x27;s. It&#x27;s $20 in sally&#x27;s and so far it&#x27;s good! I don&#x27;t have a problem with it, and it keeps my nails shiny! I&#x27;ve never bought any other gel top coat other than this, so I wouldn&#x27;t know how to compare it with any other product. I use it as a top coat for my acrylic nail, and I like how fast it dries under the UV light.</li>
    <li> the shine on this is great love it</li>
    <li> Love intense seal! Will never use anything else. The price was fantastic! I&#x27;ve been a Nail Technician for 38 yrs, best stuff ever!</li>
    <li> Love it!! Packaging was great.</li>
    <li> I chose 5 stars because it arrived fast worked well with my uv light and my customers nails look amazing</li>
    <li> Works. Would recommend</li>
    <li> i love this gel top coat,,,,, i will never use another brand!  this is so convenient and hardens to a beautiful non tacky finish...love it love it love it....</li>
    <li> Awesome product,great price. Will order again</li>
    <li> Love to use this when I do my acrylics. Seals the cuticle as well for nails that don&#x27;t lift. Bought it at a beauty supply but paid way more.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I put one coat on my nails and place under uv light for 3 min. Shines and hardens like glass.</li>
    <li> When it comes to gel top coats, I prefer IBD. I have tried other brands, but always go back to IBD. The past few years, I have only been able to find this product where I used to purchase IBD Ultra Seal (professional beauty supply stores). No one could advise if this was a new product or a replacement for the Ultra Seal. When I read it had the same no buffing and mirror like finish qualities, but did not leave the tacky finish like the Ultra Seal, I thought I would finally purchase it. I DO NOT LIKE IT! The Intense Seal &amp;#34;curdles&amp;#34; once applied, leaves a pitted finish to the nails when cured, and then chips off shortly after. I have tried applying different thicknesses, but I end up with the same results every time. I have only tried it with gel overlays (without any type of polish). It is indeed very shiny and has no need to cleanse after curing, but the finish is not smooth. I was hoping to save a step, but the pitted finish requires filing/buffing, and a different top coat (such as Ultra Seal) to add shine if polish is not used. This product may work better on other wraps such as acrylic, but I have not tried it that way. I have been able to purchase the Ultra Seal on Amazon, so I am going back to that!</li>
    <li> Seals very well great product</li>
    <li> Make sure you don&#x27;t use it on uv gel polish, it will crack!&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it is a very good product!</li>
    <li> I love this top coat. It does what it say and cures really fast. Plus it shipped and delivered same week.</li>
    <li> Love this sealer.. Quick and easy with no sticky mess</li>
    <li> Worked great. Will buy again</li>
    <li> This item did not work for me at all. I find it to be extremely brittle and it cannot be soaked off, it must be buffed of which is a big \\&quot;no-no\\&quot; for me as I&#x27;m trying to nurse my natural nails back to health after many years of acrylics.  THUMBS DOWN!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.  Just continue to get your nails done and don&#x27;t think you can buy professional grade products like this, and have them work.  It doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this product from the first time I used it, it does its job and does it right and its super shiny. Please do keep in mind that this is NOT a topcoat though its just meant to seal your acrylic after you file but before you polish.</li>
    <li> I have recently started doing my own acrylic nails and decided to try this product. I love how fast and easy it is, not to mention how great it makes your nails look after. I&#x27;d recommend this product for anyone (acrylic nails or not). It gives your nail the shiny and smooth appearance that I couldn&#x27;t get with normal clear coat. I own a UV light and under this light, the polish takes less than a minute to dry! I love it!</li>
    <li> Omg I love it! Great product works well with my uv dryer. Dries rock solid in 4 mins! Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for YEARS to find a high shine top coat that doesn&#x27;t lose it&#x27;s luster quickly.  This is it! It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve ever had and I will never switch to something different. The only downside is the strong smell.  Absolutely wonderful product!</li>
    <li> this is a good product, but I have a hard time using it without ending up with little bubbles in my nails</li>
    <li> Tried to return it but they wouldn&#x27;t take it back because I missed the return period.  NOT happy.  Wasted money on this one.</li>
    <li> Amazing product absolute mirror shine that lasts for a long time. .I noticed chipping at the tips when I had painted at work under top coat but very happy. .arrived before time due</li>
    <li> This is amazing. Gives my gel nails that glossy finish.</li>
    <li> when i received the package the bottle was cracked and some of the gel was spilled out. the gel isnt shinny enough and i wont be purchasing this brand again.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I do my own nails as a personal hobby and I use this product as a finishing touch on all my nail designs.</li>
    <li> Loved th  price, will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes artificial nails shine for weeks. The price is descent.</li>
    <li> Awful! This seal cracks within an hour after a gel polish.  Wish I could get money back. Extremely disappointed</li>
    <li> This product is a described.</li>
