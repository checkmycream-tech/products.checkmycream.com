      <li>If you like tropical, fruity scented perfumes, you will love this one.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite perfume of all time.</li>
      <li>but now I just stock up on them while they are here. :)</li>
      <li>but anyway, its ok,  for the price.  </li>
      <li>I love almost all of Escada&#x27;s perfumes.</li>
      <li>like most of the Escada line - this one, tho, is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I always get comments from men when I wear the sexy graffiti.</li>
      <li>Ladies, you should buy :)</li>
      <li>I think I will continue to purchase more perfumes by Escada.</li>
      <li>This is my all time FAVORITE fragrance.</li>
      <li>I love the scent and although I may not notice the fragrance after an hour</li>
      <li>I hope that Amazon starts to make sure of the authenticity of their products</li>
      <li>This perfume really smells great.</li>
      <li>Fresh new scent - perfect for summer.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fruity, it&#x27;s fun, and it most certainly is sexy!</li>
      <li>Smells pretty darn good to me.  </li>
      <li>It is really refreshing and light, and has more floral notes than Island Kiss or Rockin Rio.</li>
      <li>You better buy some while it&#x27;s still available.</li>
      <li>I am not given easy route to return it.</li>
      <li>The Seller shipped this item very quickly after I ordered it</li>
      <li>I used several of the others from Escada which have all been very nice, although they weren&#x27;t Sexy Graffiti.  </li>
      <li>sure I love the sweet light smell of sexy graffiti it right up my alley.  </li>
      <li>that&#x27;s light and clean, and I would say that it smells like the grapefruit version of Escada Moon Sparkle (which I think smells more like strawberries and champagne).  </li>
      <li>but I do wish there were some other note that took its place right beside the grapefruit!), but if you are, this is might be perfect for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  </li>
      <li>and I now get to enjoy her scent.  </li>
      <li>I am happy to have it back into my rotation.</li>
      <li>I wonder if this is really the authentic Escada Sexy Graffiti?</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fresh, clean, yummy, pick-me-up scent that I get many compliments on - from both men &amp; women.  </li>
      <li>Escada has been delivering great fragrances for a long time</li>
      <li>fruity &amp; fun!</li>
      <li>I will make sure to have two large bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the bottle came without the signature charm and ribbon that always comes on a full size bottle and it just smelled &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>A couple of my friends wear Escada and I absolutely fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>The second level is more of a sexy, earthy (not musky) smell that makes you want to get closer.  </li>
      <li>really love Escada&#x27;s summer fragrances and this is my fourth favorite of the ones I have tried and smelled.  </li>
      <li>I went back and ordered 2 more sexy graffiti and another Rio.</li>
      <li>However, having tested this out at Sephora and Perfumania while this was available, I am quite confident it&#x27;s not a fake (or the best fake</li>
      <li>I am going to buy more to stock up, this is better than the other Escada perfumes, soft, feminine, never overpowering, a hint of citrus with tempting berry top note, really lovely.</li>
      <li>Not cloyingly sweet, but just right.</li>
      <li>you like a light sexy, but dark sexy flora scent</li>
      <li>Love this Sexy Graffiti Limited Edition.  </li>
      <li>To me, I mostly smell peony (which is an amazing yet subtle floral scent), raspberries (this is where the sweetness comes into play), and grapefruit (the light citrus in this makes the scent smell really clean and light).&lt;br</li>
      <li>Sexy Graffiti is one of my all time favorite perfume, it is still sweet but not as sugary as their other scents.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, fruity, and very feminine.</li>
      <li>I resorted to buying the old 2002 version (in the 0.4ml bottle) not as potent and have treated it like gold.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love to wear this perfume in the spring/summer-where everything is electric and coming alive, this scent matches that vibe.</li>
      <li>The first thing I catch is a hint of something sweet and candy-like.</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t look like the original Escada Sexy Graffiti I bought years back in NYC from Macy&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>Because it is a watered down perfume, it&#x27;s more of a refreshing body spray that you can reapply.</li>
      <li>Putting it on instantly makes me go out for a night on the town or fall into my next great adventure.</li>
      <li>the product arrives very fast, I like</li>
      <li>This is bring sexy back 4</li>
      <li>I am pleased that Escada brought back this summer fragrance!</li>
      <li>With my body chemistry and this perfume I never fail to attract a man.</li>
      <li>I first brought it in North Carolina</li>
      <li>So glad they brought this fragrance back.  </li>
      <li>Fragrance is ok but the concentration is very low.</li>
      <li>except it&#x27;s a little fruity, a bit sweet but not sickenly so, and it&#x27;s fresh, clean and uplifting!</li>
      <li>I wore this for a long time, it&#x27;s my favorite perfume ever</li>
      <li>I own about 3 to 4 different Escada fragrances currently, but when Sexy Graffiti hit the scene back in 2003 or 2004 I purchased this fragrance 3 times.</li>
      <li>Will continue to purchase as long as I can! :)</li>
      <li>I was excited to see that Escada put this back on the market and when I got it, it brought me back so many memories...</li>
      <li>Good price for size but doesn&#x27;t last long...</li>
      <li>Its for real.</li>
      <li>It is a very fruity-sweet scent, almost tropical.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wife liked the scent!</li>
    <li> A couple of my friends wear Escada and I absolutely fell in love with it. I love the scent and although I may not notice the fragrance after an hour my husband says I smell great.  I would highly recommend.  The Seller shipped this item very quickly after I ordered it and I received it in less than a week.</li>
    <li> I like more fruity scents and this fits the bill perfectly. It is subtle, yet refreshing. Have had a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> This product exceeded my expectations.  If you like tropical, fruity scented perfumes, you will love this one.  My husband loves it too.  This is the best tropical-scented perfume I have ever purchased.  I think I will continue to purchase more perfumes by Escada.</li>
    <li> This is bring sexy back 4 sure I love the sweet light smell of sexy graffiti it right up my alley.  Would recommend this to my closes friends!</li>
    <li> I own about 3 to 4 different Escada fragrances currently, but when Sexy Graffiti hit the scene back in 2003 or 2004 I purchased this fragrance 3 times. Unfortunately, Escada stopped making it and I was truly hurt. This is my favorite perfume of all time. In my opinion it beats Chanel #5, this fragrance has the ability to make a man turn is head several times. I am extremely ecstatic that Escada decided to bring this back for a limited edition. I will make sure to have two large bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like a light sexy, but dark sexy flora scent this is for you. With my body chemistry and this perfume I never fail to attract a man. I always get compliments on when wore this. I am happy to have it back into my rotation.</li>
    <li> I love all the Escada Limited edition scents and this one was no different. I did not know the scent but bought it anyway based on the description and simply loved it! One of my faves already!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume! It seems like I am always searching for it though.  I was really surprised that I actually bought it cheaper this time.  Very Pleased!</li>
    <li> Love this Sexy Graffiti Limited Edition.  Fresh new scent - perfect for summer.  Will buy another one for back up.</li>
    <li> So glad they brought this fragrance back.  It made for a perfect birthday gift.  We may even buy another before it disappears again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Granddaughter and she was thrilled with it.  I couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the stores around.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance. It&#x27;s light, fruity, and very feminine. This is one of Escada&#x27;s best fragrances. I receive compliments every time I wear Sexy Graffiti!</li>

    <li> the product arrives very fast, I like</li>
    <li> THIS IS MY ALL TIME FAVORITE FRAGRANCE!!!! IT STAYS WITH ALL DAY AND THE COMPLIMENTS!!!!! LADIES MEN LOVE THIS ONE !!</li>
    <li> This does not smell like the 1oz bottle that we purchased in the past. not as sweet and seems watered down. The bottle was also missing the charm/ribbon that is pictured... I would like to return this product</li>
    <li> I wonder if this is really the authentic Escada Sexy Graffiti? the bottle came without the signature charm and ribbon that always comes on a full size bottle and it just smelled &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;. I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell once I sprayed it on. So disappointed. I hope that Amazon starts to make sure of the authenticity of their products such a make up and perfumes/colognes. This is the second time that I have received an &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34; product. So disappointed.</li>
    <li> Different scents sit differently on different people - this one sits really well with me:)</li>
    <li> My wife got this as she was looking to get this product cheaper then selling it at stores.  She got her wish and I now get to enjoy her scent.  It does smell great and with the price it was well worth it.</li>
    <li> It is such a flirty, fruity tutty scent! (Perfecto for that date night!) My boyfriend loves it and says it smells almost like candy. Purchasing it on here is by far cheaper than Sephora. You get double the amount for the same price! The package arrived earlier than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**[Edit] The actual perfume does not last very long so I have to re-spray it throughout the day or drown myself with it in the beginning in order for it to last the entire day. Because it is a watered down perfume, it&#x27;s more of a refreshing body spray that you can reapply.</li>
    <li> This is my all time FAVORITE fragrance. I now wear escada exclusively. I resorted to buying the old 2002 version (in the 0.4ml bottle) not as potent and have treated it like gold.  I recently found the limited 2011 version. Bought 2 bottles being a bit skeptical this was the same. Just go it and Rockin Rio. Its for real. I went back and ordered 2 more sexy graffiti and another Rio. I always get comments from men when I wear the sexy graffiti. I wish this was  permanently available!!!</li>
    <li> I get compliments when I wear this one, even at the dentist. I love almost all of Escada&#x27;s perfumes. The original Sexy Graffiti (when it first came out in early 2000&#x27;s) is too expensive to buy now, even if you can find them, so when Escada decided to bring out this remake I was thrilled. I am going to buy more to stock up, this is better than the other Escada perfumes, soft, feminine, never overpowering, a hint of citrus with tempting berry top note, really lovely.</li>
    <li> This perfume really smells great. There are several layers to it that catch your sense of smell. The first thing I catch is a hint of something sweet and candy-like. Not cloyingly sweet, but just right. The second level is more of a sexy, earthy (not musky) smell that makes you want to get closer.  It has that little bit of linger to it that makes you come back for another sniff. Escada has been delivering great fragrances for a long time so I&#x27;m not surprised that they delivered yet another one to their line up. It&#x27;s just a shame that it&#x27;s a limited time fragrance. You better buy some while it&#x27;s still available.</li>
    <li> Escada is known for making some of the most deliciously sweet scents, that unfortunately are only here for a limited time. Sexy Graffiti is one of my all time favorite perfume, it is still sweet but not as sugary as their other scents. It is really refreshing and light, and has more floral notes than Island Kiss or Rockin Rio. To me, I mostly smell peony (which is an amazing yet subtle floral scent), raspberries (this is where the sweetness comes into play), and grapefruit (the light citrus in this makes the scent smell really clean and light).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, those who want this scent can get it at ULTA or SEPHORA as of now! I know I used to buy this on EBay for a ridiculous amount, but now I just stock up on them while they are here. :)</li>
    <li> I really love this perfume. I first brought it in North Carolina and I thought the smell was incredible. I now just order it online whenever I&#x27;m close to being out.</li>
    <li> I have worn it for years, I get lots of compliments but the thing with perfumes is it has to go with the pheromones in your body.</li>
    <li> My wife loves all the Escada perfumes, since she loves the fruity scents.  But most importantly, I loved it.  Smells pretty darn good to me.  Ladies, you should buy :)</li>
    <li> Good price for size but doesn&#x27;t last long...very short life once sprayed.</li>
    <li> Escada makes the best fragrances. This is a good price too.</li>
    <li> Great price for this rare perfume... My wife loves it ... I do too</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t look like the original Escada Sexy Graffiti I bought years back in NYC from Macy&#x27;s.  But is smells the same...fruity &amp; fun!</li>
    <li> I first received this perfume as a highschool graduation gift years ago, and later on when I wanted to purchase it was discontinued. I was excited to see that Escada put this back on the market and when I got it, it brought me back so many memories... It is a very fruity-sweet scent, almost tropical. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I am pleased that Escada brought back this summer fragrance! It is very nice and I always get compliments when wearing it from men and women alike! I definitely would purchase again!</li>
    <li> I wore this for a long time, it&#x27;s my favorite perfume ever, then I couldn&#x27;t get it anymore.  I used several of the others from Escada which have all been very nice, although they weren&#x27;t Sexy Graffiti.  I was so excited to see this come back on the market again.  I hope they don&#x27;t take it away from me twice.</li>
    <li> Never even close to what we expected. Sometimes I feel like I am wearing just water when I use it. Fragrance is ok but the concentration is very low. I want to return this.  I am not given easy route to return it. I want to call Amazon.</li>
    <li> The listed notes of this perfume include raspberry, black currant and pink grapefruit, but honestly, I smell 85% grapefruit.  It&#x27;s kind of a &#x27;sparkling&#x27; scent that&#x27;s light and clean, and I would say that it smells like the grapefruit version of Escada Moon Sparkle (which I think smells more like strawberries and champagne).  I don&#x27;t smell much of the black currant, but there is a bit of raspberry if I spend a lot of time trying to sniff it out.  I just find this a really inoffensive, fun scent that I can wear without worrying about suffocating someone on my way to wherever.  It doesn&#x27;t smell &#x27;fake,&#x27; in the scents (haha...get it?) that a lot of fruity perfumes do (e.g. synthetic fruity), and it&#x27;s not super sweet, either (which is a huge bonus if you get headaches from heavier scents)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the drydown, it doesn&#x27;t really develop that much on me (I mean...it&#x27;s a pretty basic fruity scent), and that actually leads me to the biggest con about the fragrance: the longevity.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just because the scent itself is lighter and &#x27;fresher&#x27; than Taj Sunset or Rockin&#x27; Rio (which are slightly warmer fruity scents), but this one doesn&#x27;t last as long as my other ESCADA fragrances; it stays on the skin a tiny bit shorter than Moon Sparkle does, which is quite disappointing for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love Escada&#x27;s summer fragrances and this is my fourth favorite of the ones I have tried and smelled.  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of grapefruit (i.e. I like grapefruit but I do wish there were some other note that took its place right beside the grapefruit!), but if you are, this is might be perfect for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  The bottle that Amazon ships doesn&#x27;t have &amp;#34;Sexy Graffiti&amp;#34; written on it beneath the ESCADA (which other Escada bottles tend to have), and it doesn&#x27;t come with a charm.  However, having tested this out at Sephora and Perfumania while this was available, I am quite confident it&#x27;s not a fake (or the best fake I&#x27;ve ever smelled!).</li>
    <li> I  have another escada fragance.  &amp;#34; Cherry in bloom&amp;#34;, and the quality, the smell... i loved everything, thats why i decided to try with this escada too.  But i felt  a little dissapointed, because  the smell was like cheap, and it doesnt last long.  but anyway, its ok,  for the price.  But i wouldn t buy it again.</li>
    <li> My favorite! So glad I was able to get this scent! Makes me feel like summer on my skin!</li>
    <li> LOVE this scent....  It&#x27;s a fresh, clean, yummy, pick-me-up scent that I get many compliments on - from both men &amp; women.  It&#x27;s delightful - not too sweet (not &amp;#34;sugary&amp;#34; at all) and it&#x27;s not heavy and obnoxious.  It&#x27;s one of the best scents ever!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like most of the Escada line - this one, tho, is my favorite.  I don&#x27;t know how to explain what the scent it - except it&#x27;s a little fruity, a bit sweet but not sickenly so, and it&#x27;s fresh, clean and uplifting!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiance and I love it; so does she!!!!  It has an incredible, long-lasting scent!!!  She receives compliments all the time!!!</li>
    <li> Not overly pungent, a nice subtle- modern scent that I use myself for work (Bar) I get a lot of compliments on it and hope that it becomes a more permanent line of escada....</li>
