<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The new beauty craze from UK is here. No other than the Duchess of Cambridge is using this as part of her regular beauty regimen. It is expensive because most of them are still imported from UK. Also, the process of extracting the venom from the bees is not an easy process. They do not harm the bees, but instead they use a small amount of electrical impulses to excite the bees to produce the venom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I are using this. The substance feels and looks like a bit similar to Ponds. It is cold but doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all. I didn&#x27;t see considerable changes on my skin yet, but my 50 year old skin is nice to begin with. A bit of tightening and plumping and a bit more supple. I don&#x27;t experience dryness the whole day. My wife has better results. She mentioned a little tingling which I heard is just normal. Her skin looks healthier and seems to stretch a bit making her wrinkles less visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it depends also how your skin reacts to the venom. There is a warning on the product for those who are very sensitive or allergic to bees. At the same time it is actually how your body reacts to the venom that produces the results. So, a little bit of sensitivity maybe the key if this will work on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes.</li>
    <li> At first, my wife was very skeptical of Beenigma and thought that it was another in a long line of creams offering false promises. After three weeks of use my wife has not only been won over, but she is recommending Beenigma to her friends. My wife has never had a significant number of wrinkles her face  but now her skin is noticeably smoother. She really enjoys the natural fragrance (a bit like honey, but not as strong) and the tingling sensation she experiences when it is on her face. The only concern remains for her is the possible long term effect of placing bee venom on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beenigma claims that bee Venom is one of nature&#x27;s most powerful agents for producing collagen and elastin production. This helps to reduce wrinkles and reverse the signs of aging. While I can&#x27;t claim that this is all true, but so far the results seem to positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes/Directions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Can be used as a nightly/morning moisturizer or it can be used a face mask (3 nights a week for 20 minutes per usage). My wife uses a very small amount, primarily around her eyes, each night before she goes to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Do not use if you have any bee allergies&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Very nice packaging - my wife made it a point to state that it was as nice as high-end cosmetics&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- My wife has not had any type of skin reaction ...rash or otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- As a nightly moisturizer she preferred Beenigma to her typical regimen of Origins moisturizer... she also thinks that it compares favorably to Lancome (which is at a similar price point)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Very high quality ingredients - nothing about the product from fragrance, packaging, consistency, to results have any signs of being a gimmicky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You definitely will want to take a look at the Beenigma webpage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final verdict - After three weeks Beenigma turned a couple of skeptics into believers. In truth, when I was offered the product for reviewing purposes we almost didn&#x27;t accept.... we thought that at best it would be a wast of time.... or at worst we would have a strong reaction with our skin. In the three weeks she has been using the product her opinion has completely reversed and now she is recommending it to her friends and family. Highly Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note we were provided a sample for reviewing purposesught that at best it would be a wast of time.... or at worst we would have a strong reaction with our skin.

    <li> I use this cream mainly for a noticeable crease/line in my neck. Somewhere along the way, I discovered this neck line and have using various creams and such to blend in back into my skin ever since. I&#x27;ve used the Bee Venom Mask for a few weeks now, applying it at night before I go to sleep, then again in the morning after my shower. It has strong fragrance that I can&#x27;t quite describe. It&#x27;s not exactly what I&#x27;d call a floral scent, but more of a clean soap smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applying it to my neck, it does seem to have a tingling/warming feeling that starts up a few minutes after application. My neck feels ever so slightly warm, almost as though it&#x27;s about to feel irritated, but then doesn&#x27;t. This reminds me of some lip treatments/glosses I&#x27;ve used that were meant to be plumping. After applying them, they start to single a bit, causing circulation to increase and the lips to get a little fuller appearance. This feeling of this Bee Venom Mask reminds me of these and seems to have similar effects. Over time it seems the mask causes fullness of the skin, and starts to fill in the lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is thick and in the ingredients it&#x27;s mentioned that it contains Shea Butter (which I love). It comes packaged in a weighty frosted glass jar, with a shiny gold screw-top lid. It&#x27;s a nice looking jar, that can sit on your bathroom counter top without screaming &amp;#34;wrinkle cream&amp;#34; to any guests who may use the restroom. It&#x27;s packaged like a high end facial cream. Just be certain the first time you use it, to try it out before you have to go out. Since there is bee venom in it, you&#x27;ll want to test it out and check to see that if the venom causes any irritation of your skin before putting it on and heading out the door. That way if you find it causes any temporary irritation of your skin, you&#x27;ll know ahead of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample of the product was provided for reviewing purposes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to inherit my Dad&#x27;s skin and my Mom&#x27;s hair, so even though I am well into my 60&#x27;s I am just starting to get wrinkles and my hair is still the color it was when I was 16.  Still, there are those few tiny crow&#x27;s feet, a couple of lines across my forehead, and most annoyingly, those inherited lines at the corners of my mouth that give me a \\&quot;hang dog\\&quot; look, make me always seem sad.  I don&#x27;t like those, so I&#x27;ve been paying special attention to them with this [[ASIN:B00DD94A4W Beenigma Bee Venom Cream Mask]] from New Zealand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer sent me a sample to try several weeks ago.  The first time I used it I noticed just the tiniest of tingles but I&#x27;ve never experienced that again.  Rather than use this as a heavy mask, I&#x27;ve been applying it after cleaning my face every morning and night, paying special attention to those wrinkles at the corners of my mouth.  After allowing it to soak in for 20 minutes or so I apply my regular moisturizer over the top. (When you&#x27;re my age you need all the moisturizing you can get!)  The smell is gentle and not unpleasant and the cream leaves no greasy feel.  After about 3 weeks, I don&#x27;t really notice any \\&quot;permanent\\&quot; improvement of the sort you might expect from Botox, but there is a very obvious difference in those lines I hate so much, particularly for several hours after applying the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandma&#x27;s $0.02 - While not quite Botox, [[ASIN:B00DD94A4W Beenigma Bee Venom Cream Mask]] seems to work quite well.</li>
    <li> I received my Beenigma in the mail a week ago and have already noticed a significant difference in my skin.  I have very dry skin and I&#x27;ve been using it on my face/neck and I started to notice a very supple youthful appearance right away.  I&#x27;m awe struck on  how effective it is around my crows feet area and above my lips.  I&#x27;m so impressed by this product so far and i&#x27;m enjoying the compliments.  I will highly recommended to my friends/family and will also give a few a holiday gifts this year.</li>
    <li> After so many years of over-priced department store creams that promise it all but deliver little results, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from Beenigma.  It does include Manuka honey, and I am aware that that is a great product, but bee venom?  Who knew?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I am delighted to say this is a product that delivers.  I have had an ugly bag under my eye from tearing up repeatedly over the death of a beloved cat.  Nothing worked to reduce it until Beenigma.  Now it is disappearing, and not slowly at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it less than two weeks and am thrilled with my results.  Flabby neck is going away.  Baggy eye is almost gone.  I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.  So, I&#x27;m delighted to recommend this face cream and plan to buy more when this is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How long will my results last?  That has yet to be determined, but, for now, I&#x27;ll keep on using it twice a day.  I&#x27;ve barely dented the contents of my jar, so I expect the jar to last for a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try.  This one works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer provided a sample for my review.</li>
    <li> When I asked my husband if he could see a difference in my Beenigma-tized skin , he answered, in his dodge-ball way, \\&quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter how you look, but how you feel.\\&quot;  At first, I scoffed at him.  After some thought, however, I realized that he was right in a way:  I know my face and skin best.  If I felt that it had changed for the better, then it probably had, even if the results were not dramatic.  After all, did I really expect to look ten years younger after using this product? No.  I had merely hoped for improvement.  Still, just to be certain that I wasn&#x27;t falling for the placebo effect, I took before, during, and two-weeks-in photographs using the same, lip-parted, smile-less, and, yes, unflattering shot after washing my face in the morning.  I zoomed in on each to see if there had been changes.  And there WERE differences -- not in the deeper wrinkles but in the overall texture of my skin.  My face looked slightly (not a lot) smoother and tighter, whether because of the bee toxin or because of the effects of the honey cream.  Although I don&#x27;t look younger, I like what this product did to my skin.  So, yes, I feel that Beenigma had an effect, albeit a subtle one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before beginning, I tested Beenigma on the underside of my forearm.  About thirty seconds later, my arm actually felt as though it was being stung, and that sensation lasted for about five minutes.  I was shocked.  I was naturally nervous about applying it to my face, even though my arm had no redness or other effects beyond the initial stinging.  The next day, I took the chance:  no stinging sensation!  Over the next week, I experienced the occasional tingling -- the kind you&#x27;d get from an astringent -- and a few quick stabs near my temple, but nothing unpleasant enough to make me stop.  During the second week, I felt no sensations at all after I applied it.  I don&#x27;t know whether my body simply got used to the toxins or if they are unevenly distributed in the cream.  I highly recommend doing a patch test first to check for sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I washed off the mask after thirty minutes, but I discovered that it had the best effect when I applied it as a night cream and left it on overnight.  The honey and emollients were enough to moisturize my skin, and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about applying sunscreen over it.  I switched from short-term, twice a day application to long-term, once a day application, making a single jar last longer with better results on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The label says prominently that Beenigma is produced in New Zealand, although the small print on the back says that it is distributed by a Gauteng, South African company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though bee venom has been described as the \\&quot;poor man&#x27;s Botox,\\&quot; you will not get Botox-like paralysis from this product. I consider that a good thing.  The biggest question for consumers is cost:  Are subtle effects worth the price?  Since no cream offers eye-popping results, I&#x27;d say yes, if you are inclined to using high-end creams to improve elasticity and general tone.  Don&#x27;t buy this if you expect dramatic results; in that case, your best bet would be a respected plastic surgeon.  Beenigma won&#x27;t work on deep wrinkles, and it won&#x27;t \\&quot;lift\\&quot; your face.  All I have to do is run my hands down my face to *feel* my softer skin, even if my husband cannot see it.

    <li> My son was visiting and he left a jar of Beenigma sitting in the bathroom. I picked it up to smell it and I was enchanted with the fragrance. It smells wonderful. Like a field of clover. So I asked him about what it was and where to get some. I honestly didn&#x27;t expect anything different or better than my Oil of Olay. Boy was I in for the surprise of my life. At 63, you get used to wrinkles above the lip and little lines everywhere but you try to keep the sagging at a minimum. Not always an easy thing to do. I noticed a difference right away. I couldn&#x27;t put my finger on exactly what it was, but I looked good. My husband asked if I had slept really well. Long story short, it&#x27;s 3 weeks and ALL my friends want to know if I got a Lifestyle Lift. Seriously. My sagging jowls are nearly gone, I glow, my skin feels so soft and looks so good and really healthy. You see the difference it makes on your skin but more importantly, you just feel pretty.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to write this review sooner because I wasn&#x27;t yet sure of the effects of this cream on my face.  I wanted to be very sure I could be honest and say how well it did work.&lt;br /&gt;Both my daughters were the ones that pointed out the differences they saw on my face from using Beenigma Venom Cream.  I had decided not to tell anyone I was using it to see if anyone saw the changes.  One daughter saw my face up close and personal and the other daughter saw it on Facebook when I spoke with her.  They both thought I had had some injections......so that is my testimony of this new product.  I intend to keep using it as my daily moisturizer and as a night cream.  I really do like it.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Beenigma Bee Venom Cream Mask in exchange for writing an honest review.  I&#x27;ve been delinquent in writing a prompt review because I wanted to give this cream the full benefit of the doubt and give it a full evaluation.  It sounds so cool - containing manuka honey and bee venom, plumping up my skin like I got stung.  Of course, when I first got it, I tried it on myself, but I then passed it on to the women in my family, including my mother-in-law, hoping that someone would find benefit above and beyond the normal drug store facial moisturizers.  Unfortunately, based on our collective experience, I cannot recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, the cream comes handsomely packaged in a nice cardboard box, and is presented in a thick glass jar with a metallic lid, similar to high end department store facial moisturizers.  The cream itself smells a bit like manuka honey mixed with cold cream, and the texture seems that way as well.  Nobody who applied it noted feeling any sort of plumping or burning or any other reaction that we expected from the bee venom.  It just felt like thick lotion, and unlike other competing facial cremes, it did not leaving the skin feeling refreshed.  The cream doesn&#x27;t really go on like a mask - it seems to absorb in fast and leave the skin a bit greasy.  It&#x27;s not really easy to wash off as the directions state as it is more like lotion than a mask.  After a few days of use, nothing felt different than using much less expensive drug store products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion?  I thought the smell was kind of neat, but all of the women in my family couldn&#x27;t stand it.  I decided to repurpose it as hand creme and see how it handled my cuticles, but my Burts Beeswax cuticle balm beat it out for that task as well.  The rest of the jar is going unused.  Unfortunately I cannot recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for only a couple weeks and can already see a noticeable difference in my skin!  It&#x27;s more even and the lines on my face are minimizing right before my eyes!  They jar is a generous amount that will last you a long time!  I would highly recommend this to anyone- whether it&#x27;s for prevention or to help minimize lines and wrinkles that have already surfaced.</li>
    <li> There has been quite a bit of media hype lately concerning the use of bee venom in facial cremes and masks. Marketed as an \\&quot;organic face lift\\&quot; bee venom products claim to smooth facial lines and improve muscle tone by causing the skin to increase it&#x27;s production of elastin and collagen. In fact, scientific research has found that the active compound in bee venom, melittin, when applied to the skin, can relax the facial muscles and improve circulation....at least temporarily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beenigma is a thick, white creme that in addition to bee venom, contains manuka honey, almond oil, shea butter, and glycerin among a long list of ingredients. I found the fragrance to be unobjectionable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Atralin, a prescription RetinA product at night so my experience with Beenigma was in the morning. After several days of patch testing Beenigma to be sure that I wasn&#x27;t allergic to it, I applied the creme to my just washed face and neck. The creme is quite thick; rubbing it between my fingers first allowed it to spread more evenly across my face. I didn&#x27;t experience any stinging, just a slight itching which disappeared after about 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The creme was absorbed fairly quickly but left the skin feeling slightly tacky. Makeup or foundation application over Beenigma was less than optimal as the tackiness of the skin caused the makeup to go on unevenly. Using a standard moisturizer over Beenigma prior to applying makeup eliminated this problem. My best experience was using Beenigma as a facial mask, tissuing it off and then applying moisturizer prior to applying my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using Beenigma, my skin felt tighter and there was a moderate but noticeable reduction of fine lines under my eyes. This effect lasted for several hours, but alas, not all day. I&#x27;ve only been using the product for several weeks, it will be interesting to see if there any long term effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample of this product was supplied in return for an honest review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Bee Nigma facial cream for about two weeks now.  I know that it&#x27;s called a mask, but to me a mask is meant to be washed off.  This cream feels so good on my face, I certainly would not wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging:  It comes beautifully packaged in a lovely jar and attractive box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consistency:  The cream is thick and creamy, so just a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance:  I was surprised to read in a few reviews that some people didn&#x27;t like the fragrance, because I really love it.  I think it has a soft, almost baby powder like smell.  It&#x27;s very mild though and dissipates quickly, so if you don&#x27;t care for it for some reason, the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the skin:  The cream feels light and smooth as it goes on and is easy to spread on the face and neck.  I haven&#x27;t experienced any tingling at all.  It remains on the skin surface feeling moist for a few minutes, then it absorbs quickly into the skin.  It never feels oily or sticky.  I&#x27;ve thrown out perfectly good jars of face cream that left an oily or sticky feeling on my face, but this product does neither.  Hours later my skin still has a soft, velvety feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noticeable changes:  I&#x27;ve noticed that my facial skin has a smoother texture, and the fine lines around my mouth have plumped up a bit.  The pores around my nose seem to have reduced in size, and that makes my skin tone even out.  The biggest improvement that I&#x27;ve noticed is that my recent onset of \\&quot;adult\\&quot; acne (I&#x27;m almost 60) has cleared up.  I&#x27;ve been battling acne in the nose area and around my nostrils for almost a year, and it has completely cleared up in the past couple of weeks.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a coincidence or not, but I plan to keep using Bee Nigma and see if it stays away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer provided a sample for review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a middle aged woman with the same complaints most women my age have - thinner, less elastic skin that shows signs of aging. I do not have sensitive skin and I am not allergic to bee stings or honey - both things you should be sure of before using this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is expensive and comes packaged appropriately - a lovely box and a beautiful jar. The cream is thick and very slightly waxy, but not unpleasantly so. It smells faintly of orange blossoms to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about 3 weeks now in the following manner - I exfoliate my face, neck and decolletage with a Buff Puff and then apply a thin coat of Beenigma. I&#x27;ve been doing this twice daily. My skin tingles very slightly and feels wonderful. It doesn&#x27;t cause any redness and it makes a wonderful base for makeup to be applied over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been applying it on the back of only one hand twice daily so that I could better judge the effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very hard to be objective when looking for signs of improvement twice daily during application, but I feel the thin skin under my eyes and on my neck feels and looks firmer and younger. It also seems to be having a brightening effect on my skin tone - blotches seem to be fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter, who lives in another city and didn&#x27;t know I&#x27;ve been using this, commented to me yesterday that I was looking wonderful! When I told her that I have been using this cream, she looked closely and said she definitely thinks there has been an improvement. When I showed her the backs of my hands and asked her to choose which hand looked better, she unhesitatingly chose the hand I&#x27;ve been using the cream on as looking much younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is some interesting science behind this cream. Manuka honey has been used for years in the treatment of skin wounds and to enhance the immune system when taken internally. Scientists are now studying it more closely because it seems to be working to treat antibiotic-resistant infections like MRSA because it inhibits the growth of bacteria! It&#x27;s remarkable stuff. Google it and you&#x27;ll find a lot of information. The Manuka honey in this cream is 20+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bee venom is also very interesting. It&#x27;s also being studied because scientists discovered this year that bee venom actually kills the HIV virus! (Google this, too.) In other words, it&#x27;s powerful stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since both of these main ingredients fight infection and inflammation - things that accelerate aging when chronically present in the body - it&#x27;s not surprising to me that it can have a visible impact on aging skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beenigma is not a miracle or a fountain of youth, but my skin is noticeably improved since using it and it makes my face feel lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample of Beenigma for reviewing purposes, but no promise for a positive review was made or implied.ant infections like MRSA because it inhibits the growth of bacteria!

    <li> I have been using bee venom skincare for more than a year.  This is a knock-off product from a newcomer company.  They don&#x27;t even  list all their ingredients on their website.  It is unclear where they get their bee venom from, or if they use humane methods to extract it.  I threw this product away and went back to my original New Zealand brand.  Kalon uses only pure ingredients, never harms a bee to get bee venom, smells clean and subtle, really works, and is cheaper.</li>
    <li> My biggest concern with a skin product, especially for the face is whether or not I am going to experience an allergic reaction from it.  Beenigma Bee Venom Cream does warn its users to be aware that as the product is made from bee venom, you may wish to avoid using this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that is the case, unfortunately you will not be able to try this out and see what a remarkable job it does on your skin. To be on the safe side, I did a week-long hand test to see if the product was going to bother me in any way.  Even though the skin on the back of my hand is of a different consistency from that of my face, I have been stung by insects on this portion of my hand with not so great repercussions;( No adverse sensations did give me the green light.  Plus, when I compared my two hands, the tested hand was noticeably softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application is simple: slather it onto your skin--I find that the consistency of this cream is tacky--so if you are expecting it to glide over your skin, you will be disappointed.  However, keep in mind that an application of Beenigma is meant as a removable treatment not as a leave-on moisturizer.  After twenty minutes I wipe it off either with a tissue or with a warm wet wash cloth. I did not experience any tingling or any other questionable reaction while the product was on my skin. The fragrance is fresh and to my extremely sensitive nose acceptable, although I would appreciate it even more if it had no scent at all. (Most products, in my opinion, are overly scented. If a product smells disagreeable from the jar, I will never use it on my skin; the resulting headache would completely ruin my day or night and completely eliminate any other benefits.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the treatment is removed, I do not feel the need to use moisturizer.  My skin feels soft and fresh--ready to face the elements.  I do have some forehead lines above my nose and some over my right eye.  Using the Beenigma every day helps to make those lines less glaring--softer--as if looking through a diffusion lens.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what they look like after I finish the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beenigma is definitely a higher-end bee venom product, but it is comparable with highly ranked products like Rodial and Skin Chemists -- the product Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall uses with good results---  which are around the same price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line?  Beenigma Bee Venom Cream is a natural alternative to Botox injections without the frozen expressionless results.  The scent is pleasant and there are noticeable changes in skin texture about which to buzz and bustle.

    <li> Very good cream well buy again !</li>
    <li> I have frown and forehead lines that are more more substantial than I would like.  I have been applying Beenigma twice a day for about a month.  Over this time frame, I have noticed an impact on the frown lines but not such a noticeable result on the forehead lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using the product in November.  I first applied the product under my chin to test for an allergic reaction. I experienced about day of itching, but I did not have any redness.  The immediate feeling upon the first application was a slight tingling and a tightness.  The itchiness set in after a few hours.  I noticed that the product had a floral scent that seemed to linger for about twenty minutes.  After not noticing any significant reaction, I proceeded to use the product the next day all over my face.  I did not encounter the itchiness or the tingling from the first day.  The sensation of tightness did come back, but it was not uncomfortable.  Throughout the weeks, subsequent applications have led to a feeling of tightness, but this sensation is often brief - maybe ten minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In week three, I started to use [[ASIN:B0000536Y7 St. Ives Blemish &amp; Blackhead Control Apricot Scrub, 6 oz]] in conjunction with this product and that is when I really started to begin noticing an impact on my skin.  I only use the St. Ives product once a day, but once it was introduced, the frown lines began to diminish more rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As noted, I have used this product for about a month.  At approximately two uses per day, I have used about a third of a jar.  I anticipate that this jar will take me through January.  I do not use a lot of product.  It spreads easily on the face and is absorbed easily as well.  It does not leave an overly shiny or greasy appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the next step would be abstaining from the product for a period of time to see what impact there is.  I&#x27;m curious to know: How quickly it would be before the deepness of my previous lines returns?  Could the product be used once a day to maintain results?  Is there a point when the product would just be a maintenance tool and no more improvement would be seen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think that this product has had an impact on my lines.  It was a great day when I woke up and truly noticed some results taking place.  I want to emphasize that it was not an overnight process.  I have been fairly dedicated to applying this cream, and I think it could potentially work for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a jar of Beenigma to test prior to posting this review.roduct be used once a day to maintain results?

    <li> When I asked my 60-year-old wife if she was interested in trying Beenigma, she was skeptical to say the least. Because of hormonal problems when she was much younger, she has a number of facial scars from acne and other skin ailments. She&#x27;s tried Mederna and countless other facial creams, but they were either too harsh, too drying, or largely ineffective. But after reading about Beenigma on the company&#x27;s website, she agreed to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the first day, she tried rubbing in a little Beenigma on a part of the left side of her face as a test. After four days of this, she said there was a noticeable improvement in her \\&quot;smile line\\&quot; and acne scars. Her skin was more supple, the lines were not as deep, and the old acne scars were less pronounced. She also said that her skin pores appeared to be smaller, but without the excessive drying that other products had produced. On the fifth day, she began applying Beenigma on her entire face and her neck. Now, after about ten days of using Beenigma twice a day, she is very pleased with the results. They&#x27;re noticeable, too - even I can see and feel the smoothing effects on her skin, and the acne scars that she hated are not as prominent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife said that the first couple of times, she felt a mild tingling, presumably from the bee venom in Beenigma, but after that, she didn&#x27;t notice it anymore. She added that a little bit goes a long way, but she informed me that we will be purchasing another jar when this one runs out. That&#x27;s okay with me. During our thirty years of marriage, I&#x27;ve seen thousands of dollars worth of cosmetics come into our bathroom, and most of them got tossed out eventually to make room for a new crop of creams and lotions that promised to be the Fountain of Youth (they weren&#x27;t). Beenigma isn&#x27;t the Fountain of Youth either, but the results have been so promising that my wife is very happy about it, and that makes me very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re even slightly interested in the product, it&#x27;s worth a trip to the company&#x27;s website to learn how the bee venom and Manuka honey are believed to work in the skin.

I don&#x27;t know what mechanism is at work here, but apparently the bee venom stimulates growth of new skin cells or something like that. In any case, my wife is extremely pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never heard of using bee venom in a cosmetic prior to finding out about this product. Although I was skeptical, after using it for a couple of weeks, there have been positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, it has not rolled back a couple of decades on my 50+ year old face. But it has visibly improved wrinkles around my eyes and on my neck. They haven&#x27;t been eradicated, but this has made more of an impact than any other cream I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be used as a mask or as a daily cream. I&#x27;ve been using it as a daily cream since that&#x27;s a more practical use for me. It has an interesting, and not unpleasant tingly feel when applied. I did have some irritation on my neck the first couple of days, but it was not excessive and did not continue once my skin became more accustomed to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the scent - it&#x27;s a floral scent, which in itself is not an issue, but it is a bit too strong. The scent lingers for a long time. An unscented version, or a version with a more subdued scent that didn&#x27;t linger would be much more appealing for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall, a good product that does produce results.&lt;br /&gt;[Sample provided for review]</li>
    <li> I have only been using the Beenigma Bee Venom Cream for a little while and can already notice a difference in my skin.  My skin feels refreshed and some of my fine lines already seem smoother and faint.  I&#x27;m so excited to see how this will transform my complexion in the coming weeks and months!</li>
    <li> Back in 2011 Dr. Oz did some segments about bee venom being used in a variety of beauty products, facial creams and masks being the big sellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bee stings causes puffiness and swelling which in turn increases the collagen and reduces the fine lines and wrinkles on your skin. Besides helping fill in lines, bee venom also help maintain skin tone and color. When a bee stings you it is the active component &amp;#34;Melittin&amp;#34; that causes the localized pain and inflammation at the injected part of your body. Melittin can absorb toxins, but it also soaks in oxygen, amino acids and hormones that can give your skin a natural rejuvenation. That is what Beenigma does without the actual bee sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon the first application I did feel a slight tingle, but after continuous use that seems to fade away. The cream is thick and quickly absorbs into your skin. Since it is so dense, it does not glide on smoothly but it disappears quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beenigma can be used as either a cream or a mask. Use as a cream: Wash face and apply morning and night. The nourishing formulation will absorb into the skin. Avoid contact with the eyes. I made the mistake of touching my eyes after applying the cream and I will never do it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use as a mask: Up to 3 times a week. Wash face and gently massage, a generous layer to your neck and face. Leave on for at least 20 minutes. Wipe off the extra layer with a towel or facial tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap is a neutralizer to the bee venom and the two products should not be used together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 4 weeks of continuous use I have seen a tremendous improvement in my skins overall tone and color. My face glows, it is extremely soft and a majority of the lines lines are faint. It has not really help with my forehead lines which are the biggest wrinkled areas, but my smile, nose and crows feet have improved significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moYO1UUZ238B37]]For beauty products like this, I always take before and after photos. To test the Beenigma, I took photos of the right side of my face, just under the eye. In less than two weeks, I noticed some wrinkles running from the corner of my eye are now gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wrinkles not only disappear, my skin feels more plump and supple. That effect was evident immediately after my first use, since I initially made a large radius around my eye. The mild inflammation was quite a contrast to the skin where it was not applied. I gradually started using the cream closer to the eye and haven&#x27;t had problems. It always tingles when I put it on, which makes me feel like it&#x27;s working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest worry with Beenigma is a reaction to the bee venom. If you are allergic, by all means stay away. I am also not sure about long term effects. It certainly works in the short term, and very quickly at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for review by Beenigma.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m never one to fall for these \\&quot;beauty in a bottle\\&quot; gimmicks.  Given that fact, I was very, very skeptical of this product.  But after having tried it, I have to say that I actually like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, has it noticeably reduced my wrinkles?  Probably not. Maybe softened a line here or there?  It&#x27;s so hard to judge these things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I can say is that it has made my skin look and feel better.  I have oily skin so after I wash it, I usually use some sort of cream to give moisture back to the parts that aren&#x27;t oily.  This process, however, always leaves part of my skin looking really dried out.  Since using this product, my skin no longer has that dried out look in some parts.  It has made my skin more supple.  It doesn&#x27;t feel dry anymore.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the bee venom or the honey they use in the product.  Whatever it is, it&#x27;s making my skin look and feel better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I was wary of is because I have oily skin that is very sensitive, I was worried I&#x27;ll start breaking out if I use this product. Well, three and a half weeks later and not a single break out!  So obviously, this can be used on all skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had also read the other reviews and was aware that some people thought it had a strong scent.  I buy everything unscented because I just can&#x27;t stand these funky scents in everything.  I have to say that the scent of this product, which is very slight, doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  It smells very slightly like honey.  You can smell it as you&#x27;re putting it on but the scent vanishes within minutes, so no problems there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a very good product.  It certainly agrees with my skin and makes it feel and look better which is ultimately all I care about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample was sent to me for review.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews before I purchased this as it&#x27;s costly ... I saw some awesome reviews . I love it as well as my organic honey with bee venom in . I only use small amounts on the areas that seem sunken in .. This seems to smooth out my face in those areas .. Like it swells the tissues but no pain at all .. I was worried I may be allergic so I tried a small amount on my hand first . Also I read where it helps in the long run b cuz it stimulates these areas and causes more blood flow in turn more collagen .. So it&#x27;s a win win for me .. I just try to saver it thou b cuz it&#x27;s expensive that&#x27;s why I use the bee venom&lt;br /&gt;Honey in between as face pacs .. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the honey or me but if I put too much on I get a slight head ache.. Probably because it&#x27;s pretty powerful .. So don&#x27;t put too much honey on .. I am 51 next week and I&#x27;m told I look about 40 a lot !!</li>
    <li> When the manufacturer contacted me to do a review of Beenigma and thus generate some buzz about it, I was intrigued. Would this facial cream tingle when applied? Would I break out in giant red spots due to an allergy (at the time I was unsure about whether I was allergic to bees)? Would I single-handedly increase the flower and honey sales in Pierre? These are questions that I am sure inquiring minds wish to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the product description (as well as the literature contained with the product packaging), Beenigma takes advantage of New Zealand bee venom, Manuka honey, shea butter, and a few other chemical tongue-twisters in their facial lotion to smooth skin and eliminate wrinkles. I was a bit skeptical about the bee venom and the honey; fortunately when I stepped outside I wasn’t mauled by a bear. After avoiding ursine attacks, I sat down to give a robust trial on a product that is very much out of my price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application &amp; Texture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beenigma comes in a small glass container and includes a plastic applicator (there is a small indentation at one end that is akin to a spoon). The smell is decidedly neutral: it does not smell fruity, flowery, or of chemicals, which is a plus. The cream is thick but easily applied; I used the stick to swipe streaks of cream under my eyes, across both cheeks, on the center of my forehead, and on my chin. Rubbing it in felt silky, with no greasy residue. Note that you can also use this cream as a mask; given the small size of the container and the cost of the product, I think that the conservative application is the best option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beenigma, as I mentioned above, is a great cream. I have used Oil of Olay before, and while it moisturizes and applies easily, there was always a lingering greasiness on my fingers and face. Conversely, the smooth coverage of the Beenigma cream was wonderful: a little swatch goes a long way, there is no strong odor, and I could snap my fingers with no issues. What does this mean? If your kids are bugging you while you are in the bathroom, you don’t have to wash your hands before you click away your disapproval! I had no idea that expensive facial creams could reduce wrinkles AND discipline unruly children!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silliness aside, the biggest question that everyone has about Beenigma is, of course, the efficacy of the product. Spending this kind of money on a beauty treatment is a considerable investment. Here is my analysis:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The texture and application of this cream is definitely neater than other, cheaper creams. From the lack of a strong odor and how it is quickly absorbed by my skin are the least of the benefits gained when using Beenigma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Make sure that you are not allergic to bee and/or wasp venom. It could be the best cream in the world, but risking anaphylactic shock is not worth your beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) There is no stinging, burn, tingle, or other sensation when applying this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) It does smooth your skin and help to make it tauter.&lt;br /&gt;Beenigma, in short, is an excellent beauty cream that definitely excels in making your face feel smoother, sexier, and confident. I followed the instructions on the bottle: after washing my face I used the cream once in the morning and once at night. With the dry heat from running the furnace, my skin dries out and sometimes cracks. With other products that I have used, I would have to reapply them every few hours. Beenigma, on the other hand, lasted a full twelve hours. Within two days, the cracks were gone completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in the market for a high-quality beauty cream that does more than make your skin greasy, smell like a florist shop, and does more than layer chemicals onto your face with no noticeable improvement, Beenigma is a godsend. From the delicate fragrance to a cream that stays where you smear it without slowly dripping down your face, Beenigma will be theproduct that will bring you compliments. And, while you will not have any ursine men lusting after you, I wouldn’t be surprised if a human or two made a pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the money to spare and want to see a noticeable change without having to use multiple products, this is for you. A little bit goes a long way and bringing out a youthful glow makes Beenigma worth its weight in gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Disclaimer: This product was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

    <li> I am 42 and I have fair skin. I have been outdoors a great deal in my life and I look like it. I was excited to be offer some Beenigma to try since I am always looking for something to make me less hag-like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Beenigma cream is beautifully packaged. It looks luxurious. The cream smells fabulous. It is a subtle sweet waxy smell that is very pleasant. The cream spreads beautifully and allows a little to go a long way. It leaves a barely tacky finish and is great under makeup. I had no problem with makeup slip while wearing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are the fun part. Beenigma claims to plump up your skin. And it really does. My saggy baggy skin has that fat thick look that I lost years ago. Lines are less noticeable. But this plump skin also looks fresher and brighter. Papery lines are gone. I have used other creams that made lines less noticeable. But this is the first cream that has ever plumped up my skin.</li>
    <li> May need to give it more time, but I am seeing a small reduction in wrinkles around my eyes. Nice size jar.</li>
    <li> I admit to wanting to try this out because it sounded so cool. If you give me the chance to safely rub bee venom all over my face, I’m going to take it—I’ve also drank liquor filled with scorpions and venomous snakes. I was pretty skeptical about the effectivity of this; almost every “miracle ingredient” turns out to be more mundane than magic. But I wanted to give it a shot just to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It surprisingly works pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bee venom works on the principle that bee stings stimulate collagen and elastin, which is what causes them to “puff up” after you have been stung. Rubbing just the right quantity of bee venom stimulates your skin and sort of “exercises it” to fill in the wrinkles with nice, fresh collagen and put a little more life back into your sagging flesh. Additional ingredients include manuka honey—which is also hailed as a skin-boosting wonder, the ubiquitous shea butter, some almond oil, and a menagerie of chemicals that have never seen the inside of a plant but still work darn good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my wife and I tried out this Beenigma (Love that name!) cream mask together. It isn’t much of a “mask,” which implies to me some opaque treatment that you later wash off. Instead this is just a cream that you massage into your face, then wait for 20 minutes. The first application gives you a sting, which I thought was great. Nothing like a little physical sensation to show you that it is working. After using it for a couple of weeks the sting has gone away, or we have just gotten used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results from the Beenigma impressed both of us. My wife is Asian, and blessed with that kind of skin that makes her look 20 years younger than she actually is. Me, not so lucky—I inherited deep crow’s feet from my father, and all of my brothers have the kind of eyes you could run rivers through. I’ve been fighting against that with sunscreen and product and have so far maintained the fort. The Beenigma did wonders for the lines I have. Both my wife and I are very pleased with the results, and far less skeptical about the effectivity of bee venom. Sting away, bees!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback I can see to Beenigma is the price—at a hundred-plus dollars a bottle, this is an extreme luxury item.  Sure it works, and it comes in a gift-quality bottle with nice presentation, but like all products of this kind its effects are temporary.  In order to keep them up, you have to keep a steady supply of Beenigma in your bathroom. I suppose wealth is all relative—to some people a hundred dollars is not a big layout of cash. But we’re not so lucky and the price is prohibitive for us to keep up with Beenigma, no matter how effective it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product for review purposes.did wonders for the lines I have.

    <li> If I hadn&#x27;t seen it with my own eyes (and felt it, too . . .)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is beyond absolutely amazing!  It is a 5 star +++ product!  Many products claim fast results, but don&#x27;t really deliver as we hope.  We are all looking for a skin product that helps with \\&quot;seasoned\\&quot; skin (I don&#x27;t like the word \\&quot;aging\\&quot;).  And we want to see results fast.  Guess what?  Here is your product!  I have seen noticeable positive results OVERNIGHT!  YES!  You heard me right.  OVERNIGHT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the evening of November 11, I began using this product.  I used a gentle microdermabrasion cream on my face to clean away any dead skin cells so the cream could penetrate, followed by cleansing with a gentle plant-based cleanser.  Without drying my face, I applied a light coating of Bee Nigma, massaging it into my face and neck. (Don&#x27;t forget your neck.  It holds your face up.)  I did not remove the product, but kept it on as a face cream.  Within about an hour, I could feel noticeably softer facial skin.  On the morning of November 12, approximately 8 hours later, I rinsed my face with cold water/wash cloth and reapplied Bee Nigma.  About an hour later, I was driving to work and all of a sudden I could feel my face tightening.  My skin was in pretty good shape anyway, but the velvety softness this product added to my skin was incredible.  I have now been using the product for 10 days and I am loving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the little things I have noticed:&lt;br /&gt;-- I keep touching my face because I cannot believe this new-found velvety softness, including the dry spot I always USED TO HAVE on the left side of my forehead. (GONE)&lt;br /&gt;-- I noticed how a washcloth GLIDES over my face.&lt;br /&gt;-- I noticed how my face retains its moisture now.&lt;br /&gt;-- I noticed how much more ALIVE my skin looks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the product as a cream, before bedtime and upon waking.  I leave it on my skin.  If I want to apply another face cream over it, I do so, but you don&#x27;t need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bee Nigma comes in a glass jar, about 2 3/8 inches in diameter and about 2 1/16 inches high.  It is NOT one of those jars with a smaller jar inside like some products do to make you think you are getting more of a product.  There is a very slight smell, but it is a natural smell, NOT fragrance.  It is made in New Zealand, with the active ingredients (in this order) of New Zealand Bee Venom and Manuka Honey.  Some of the other general ingredients include shea butter, honey and almond oil.  You can use it as a face mask, leaving on for at least 20 minutes, or you can use as a face cream and leave it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bee Nigma&#x27;s website explains the use of the bees from New Zealand that are producing the Manuka Honey from the Manuka Plant, which grows in New Zealand (more about Manuka Honey follows).  The bee venom is said to provide proteins, peptides, amino acvids and key enzymes.  The shea butter soothes and replenishes the skin, while the almond oil is fast penetrating, highly moisturizing and nourishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All honey is not the same.  Some kinds of honey may be 100 times more powerful than others.  Manuka Honey is said to provide numerous health benefits, including benefits to skin care.  It is said to provide vitamins, minerals, amino acids, anti-oxidant/anti-bacterial/anti-inflammatory properties.  Manuka is said to improve skin texture and vitality, while it is hydrating.  Manuka is said to be helpful in fighting zits and acne, provides glucose to white blood cells (our immune system warriors) while it destroys bacteria, helps to heal wounds while improving cellular regeneration, promotes collagen production, helps with burns, arthritis, and eczema.  To be considered potent enough to be therapeutic, Manuka honey needs a minimum rating of 10 UMF (Unique Manuka Factor - standard).  Bee Nigma states their Manuka Honey has a 20+ UMF rating, out of a possible 5 - 25 UMF rating standard developed by honey producers.  BTW--I have a jar of Manuka Honey and it tastes so good, you could easily use it as a spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of you may think this product is a little pricey.  I believe it is worth every penny.  As a bonus, you may find you can save money on some of the other skin products you no longer need.  It also contains NO parabens.  (According to my research, parabens are considered dangerous to our health, even in small amounts, because they accumulate, with cumulative effects.  Many companies use parabens as a preservative, to give the product a longer shelf life.  Parabens are said to be much less expensive.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bee Nigma comes with 100% guarantee.  If you are not satisfied, the website claims you can return it within 60 days.  It also says it is a CUMULATIVE product, which means the longer you use it, the more benefits you suck up through your skin.  It also claims to be anti-aging, rejuvenitive, and lifts, plumps, and reduces fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Making Bee Nigma does not harm the hard-working little bees that generously provide the primary ingredients of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, BTW - I am not a 25 year old with skin that hasn&#x27;t had time to season.  My skin has been 42 years old for the last 22 years.  I am thrilled with this product and it has far exceeded my expectations!  And, when you see an unexplained bright light coming from across a dimly lit room, it is probably just the glow coming from someone&#x27;s skin--someone who is using BEE NIGMA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that I am not a health care professional.  These are my opinions based on my personal experience and research.  Also note that if you are allergic to bee pollen or bee stings, you probably are unable to use this product and should consult your doctor before considering it.  As a matter of fact, the label says not to use it if you have a known bee allergy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so impressed by this product, that I took the extra time to provide you with some research and a lot of information.  If you try it, I believe you will be every bit as impressed as I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW - Although I received this product as a free sample for potential review, I thoroughly intend to purchase it when my sample runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/19/2014-My full-sized jar has just about run out, so, it has lasted me a little over 2 months.

    <li> There is nothing about this cream that would make me say &amp;#34;This stuff is &amp;%$@ amazing,&amp;#34; as another reviewer said. This cream is just a nice face cream. I like the smell and the consistency. But I don&#x27;t notice any tightening or plumping, so I do feel I spent a lot of money for something that didn&#x27;t deliver the promised result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I do like using it. I might pay $20 a jar for it -- maybe -- but I might also just stick with my Cetaphil.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife based on a recommendation from one of her friends. She has been using it a couple weeks now and has said it really works. It has a great smell and although my wife doesn&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles it has smoothed out the ones that she had. I can hardly see any at all now. She said she is recommending Beenigma to her friends.</li>
    <li> My husband noticed my hands were softer and smoother.  He is oblivious.  I thank the manufacturer for the product, and I am grateful for the smooth hands.  I do notice some tightening in my face, and friends have said I look rested.  I always wonder what they mean, did I look work worn before?  But I take the compliment.  I can see it best on my neck and hands, and those are big concerns for me.  And well, my husband noticed!</li>
    <li> Bee Venom is a traditional remedy that has been rediscovered.  The trend got hot when this new \\&quot;natural Botox\\&quot; was adopted by Kate Middleton as part of her skin care regimen before her wedding to Prince William. Gwyneth Paltrow is another big fan who is singing its praises.  The question is: Does it really work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The short answer is Yes.  I tried a sample (which I received from the manufacturer in exchange for a fair and honest review).  It may not be The New Botox, but it&#x27;s one of the best topical skin care products I&#x27;ve tried and it does appear to minimize fine lines, skin discolorations and even some light scars.  It&#x27;s especially good around the eyes, where it also helps with minor puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using Beenigma Bee Venom Cream for a week, my skin is noticably smoother.  It may be the honey, which is not only an exceptional moisturizer, but also a natural antibacterial, so it fights inflammations, acne and infections. It also brightens the skin, gives it a nice healthy glow. This is probably from the venom, which is said to stimulate circulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anything that boosts circulation is a good thing. More nutrients and more oxygen mean that even older skin has what it needs to produce stronger cells and, most important, stronger and more limber collagen and elastin. These make up the tiny little connector fibers that hold your skin in place.  Like any elastic that is constantly stretched, after a while the collagen and elastin fibers get saggy and baggy -- and so does our skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bee venom is an excellent healer for damaged skin.  This is due to a high concentration of Mellitan, a very powerful anti-inflammatory, about 100 times more potent than hydrocortisone.  This means that if you have sensitve skin, lots of minor breakouts, or rough and scaly patches, Beenigma may be a big help.  It might even help alleviate rosacea and eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I especially like about Beenigma is that I can see a difference right away.  I use it in the morning and it makes my skin look healthy. The little wrinkles around my eyes look smoother.  It also plumps up my complexion, so my face looks tigher, more toned.  I don&#x27;t know if the effects are long term, but the cream, while expensive, costs a lot less than Botox which works extremely well on deep wrinkles caused by contracting muscles, but can&#x27;t help that quilted look that&#x27;s a sign of older skin. Botox also has no real therapeutic value. Beenigma does. On the other hand, Beenigma won&#x27;t erase those deep creases between the eybrows or on the forehead, or the Howdy Doody lines around the mouth. Only Botox or other fillers work on those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Paltrow, it also erases minor scars, even older ones.  If it works on scars, it may also work on dark patches and sun damage.  Worth trying since even at $130 for a small jar, it&#x27;s less than the usual dermatological procedures needed to get rid of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had one concern about the bee venom ingredient. It was my understanding that a bee dies after stinging and i wondered if collecting the venom resulted in the death of the bee. I&#x27;m not a big bee fan and run when one gets close, but they are becoming scarce and are essential to life on our planet. Killing them off for a face cream seems a little over the top.  However, in checking out venom suppliers, it turns out that the method of collection doesn&#x27;t harm the bee. The bees are trained to eject venom against glass. They release venom when they feel threatened, and the beekeepers use different smells that trigger the response in their bees. The venom is collected from the glass and the bees go back to regular bee life until they are needed for another donation.  The process is painstaking: One gram of venom from New Zealand, a major producer, is the equivalent of 10,000 bee stings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Beenigma in the morning because I just like the way it makes my skin look after application. It makes a nice base for face make up.  I alsouse it at night after cleansing.  If I can see that it&#x27;s working, I&#x27;m happy.  Too many products boast about \\&quot;visible\\&quot; results that need a magnifying glass to see.  Beenigma won&#x27;t take ten years off your face, but it will make the face you have look a little smoother, a little healthier. It helps with puffy eyes (but not those under-eye bags...they&#x27;re usually filled with fat, not water and need to be treated surgically), makes your complexion glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the cream on my lips as well. Bee venom is often found in the better lip plumpers because it makes them lips look fuller and softens the vertical lines that make a face look tired and old, and that make lipstick &#x27;bleed.&#x27; For me, Beenigma is a very effective facial cream, well worth the $130 pricetag, especially since a little of the product goes a very long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you want an instant quick fix for your complexion, if you want your skin to look younger and healthier, your wrinkles to look less entrenched, you might want to considr Beenigma.
