      <li>those reading this review, it will be more as a comparison with Wen.</li>

      <li>It was ok when I used it</li>
      <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this pump</li>
      <li>mostly box dye</li>
      <li>I love the 2 in 1 concept.</li>
      <li>still love Wen, but ounce for ounce, dollar for dollar -</li>

      <li>and I find the tingle on my scalp enjoyable.</li>

      <li>But it is good for hot weather when you want to do cooling off shampoos</li>
      <li>so she does Aveeno Pure Renewal sulfate free shampoo (1 time) followed by the Pantene cleansing conditioner (1 time), and that works great for her.  </li>
      <li>Excellent for dry, damaged hair.</li>
      <li>Best product for dry curly hair</li>
      <li>so I am always looking for a shampoo that will condition and clean well!  </li>
      <li>Most bottles are just fine.    </li>
      <li>Her hair is natural and this cleanses and moisturizes great.</li>
      <li>The severe cradle cap and itching are still gone for now 13yo dd, and she is finding that her hair is becoming silkier as she goes along.  </li>
      <li>and I can honestly say she is right.</li>
      <li>my hair feels clean something i dont get from most cowashes for AA hair.</li>
      <li>, they make my hair brittle and it breaks easily.  </li>
      <li>It is a conditioner with a strong mint-ish smell and feel, It warms on my scalp.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> For dry hair only. Not for oily or normal hair. Very strong fragrance. If you are smell sensitive at all, do not buy this.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! Wen was so insanely expensive and this is a great alternative. The smell is far better than wen as well! I have many different textures in my hair and this is perfect on them all!</li>
    <li> I really am impressed with this cleansing conditioner...I have naturally course, frizzy hair and nothing has ever tamed it. I was going to try Wen but it was really expensive and you had to enter into a reshipment contract which I wasn&#x27;t keen on. So I tried Pantene&#x27;s version instead and I really love it! I&#x27;ve used it for 3 months now and my curls are soft and bouncy. Lathers just enough so there are suds going down the drain and then I just leave it in for the rest of my shower. No more dry frizzy hair! Love!</li>
    <li> I really like this cleanser because it is effective at cleaning yet it doesn&#x27;t strip the hair down to squeakiness. I can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s color safe because I use Cellophanes coloring that washes out gradually anyway.  But it is good for hot weather when you want to do cooling off shampoos,that&#x27;s when it really pays off to have this stuff handy.</li>
    <li> It is a conditioner with a strong mint-ish smell and feel, It warms on my scalp.  It lathers like a conditioner and I don&#x27;t think it strips the oil as well as a shampoo, but I need that since I use it as a every other day wash.  I feel it saves me some time since I don&#x27;t need to shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Wow, I really like a lot of Pantene products, but as a former Wen user this was extremely disappointing. Not only did I feel this was drying, it left a horrible &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; like feel in my hair. It took me forever to figure it out because I use so many hair products. So, I did an elimination &amp;#34;diet&amp;#34; of each hair product and came to the conclusion it was this.  I had to use a clarifying shampoo afterwards, now my hair is back to normal. I will go back to Wen.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner. Hair feels clean and smells wonderful</li>
    <li> I cancelled my Wen subscriptions and plan to buy this from now on.</li>
    <li> My daughter had been really struggling with itchy scalp, terrible sebhorreic dermatitis (like severe cradle cap on a 12 yo...not pretty), and bushy/frizziness.  We thought trying a cleansing conditioner would be worth a shot.  This was about the only option carried at our local Walmart, so we gave it a shot.  Works great for her.  the dermatitis has completely cleared up, her scalp doesn&#x27;t itch, she no longer clogs up the drain with hair in the shower, and she no longer looks like a 12yo skater boy.  Plus now her hair stays clean for days.  So I decided to try it too.  The amount of hair shedding has dropped dramatically, both in the shower and when brushing.  My hair color now has more natural highlights/lowlights.  And my hair stays cleaner, longer too.  I have seen in the reviews that others have had various results.  I would say that, given the cost involved, it is worth trying if you are having issues just to see if it might solve some problems.  This is WAY less expensive than trips to the dermatologist and the scalp treatments he was prescribing.  The only issue I have now is that I can&#x27;t seem to find it in the stores around here...they only have the color protecting one rather than the damage repair.  The damage repair more suits our needs.  11/16/15 Update Have been ordering on Amazon since it is no longer available in local stores from what I have been able to see.  We have found that shedding has gone back up some, but it is still not as bad as it was.    I have found that there is quite a variation in fragrance from bottle to bottle...from a light fragrance of mint to an almost heavy mentholated scent.  I haven&#x27;t been able to determine why the variation.  Most bottles are just fine.    The severe cradle cap and itching are still gone for now 13yo dd, and she is finding that her hair is becoming silkier as she goes along.  Younger dd has started using it too, but we found that she needed something a little more aggressive on the cleaning side - so she does Aveeno Pure Renewal sulfate free shampoo (1 time) followed by the Pantene cleansing conditioner (1 time), and that works great for her.  Her hair is so soft and silky it can be hard to put it in a pony tail.  Since the shampoos are not aggressively stripping out oils, she can go 1.5-2 weeks (no kidding!!!!) before her hair even starts to show any sign of being oily - which she loves since she can just throw on a shower cap for a quick shower as the shampooing and drying her long, thick hair can be somewhat time consuming.  I&#x27;m sure that once puberty really kicks in, that length of time will drop.  I have found that I prefer the Aveeno/Pantene combo myself, and I have seen a drop in scalp itchiness and flaking.  Older dd will periodically do a single round of the Aveeno if she thinks she needs it, but it works better for her to stick with the Pantene only.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the only product I can wash my hair with without it feeling like straw. No shampoo will do that for my thick, coarse, and now over bleached hair, none. Cocleansing is the way to go for me.</li>
    <li> While this product does cleanse hair and is sulfate-free, it isn&#x27;t the right product for me. It left my scalp quite itchy and dry, which I found odd considering that it really shouldn&#x27;t do that at all. I&#x27;ve used cleansing conditioners before and have never had that happen. I know how to completely rinse this out of my hair and will typically rinse for 3-5 minutes and then part my hair in three sections just to be sure it is all out. I really wanted to love this, but I just can&#x27;t. Perhaps it is my hair/scalp combination. My scalp and hair are both dry. I have curly (type 3a) hair that needs a lot of moisture and love. This product just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have thick, curly hair that I currently (and generally except for a number of years I had it a bob) wear long.  Curly hair is so unpredictable in terms of frizz.  Lots of the styling products I find make my hair sticky and weighted down because of the length of hair that that product needs to be applied too.  This co-wash leaves my hair well nourished - better than when I would shampoo and condition separately... since the emphasis is on conditioning with a light (but perfect) amount of washing.  I find that just some light mousse in my wet hair, air dry, is all I need and my curls look great.  This has a nice scent to it as well - smells nice while washing.  Light scent after showering.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using cleansing conditioners since 2008. I used Wen regularly, which worked the best but is incredibly hard to find and very expensive; I&#x27;ve tried L&#x27;Oreal which smells horrible and doesn&#x27;t clean or hydrate, and other cheaper brands from Sally&#x27;s that were just as terrible... but I have dandruff problems, so I would always have to switch back and forth between anti-dandruff shampoos/conditioners for the active ingredient of zinc pyrithione, as it would alleviate most of my flakes.... but behold- this Pantene cleansing conditioner is a CHEAPER, BETTER SMELLING, EASILY ACCESSIBLE (Wal-mart carries it!) cleansing conditioner AND IT HAS ZINC PYRITHIONE!!! Wow! How did Pantene get so awesome?? They don&#x27;t market this as an anti-dandruff product at all, but if you read the ingredients, it&#x27;s in there. I&#x27;m not sure what the percentage is (Head &amp; Shoulders conditioner contains 0.5% Zinc Pyrithione) but I plan to contact Pantene and see if they will let me know and I will re-post it here in this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall- this is the best stuff for anyone with dry, thick, naturally curly frizzy hair...who may or may not have dandruff. My advise is to get one of those tangle teazer type brushes for detangling wet hair and leave it in the shower. Apply quiet a bit of this stuff all over your hair and start at bottom and work your way up brushing out the tangles with this in your hair. Then rinse. Repeat if necessary, and if your hair is super dry, you can actually leave a tiny bit in your hair as a leave-in conditioner. One product. So simple :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh- and it makes your scalp tingle with a menthol feeling and it&#x27;s wonderful! Another plus- it&#x27;s great for traveling; although this stuff is heavy, you only need to pack one bottle (not 2 or 3 since it replaces regular shampoo/conditioner/leave-in conditioner/serum) and since it&#x27;s a super thick cream, I don&#x27;t have to worry about it leaking. Does it get any better?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: this is not a good product for someone with fine, thin, limp, oily hair.ne with fine, thin, limp, oily hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why people actually like this product. It left my feeling hair dry and frizzy, yet gunky at the same time. I couldn&#x27;t stand the way it felt on my scalp -- it wasn&#x27;t the light tingling sensation others described. It actually kind of burned. Also, it smells AWFUL. I tossed this in the trash after one use.</li>
    <li> I tried another brands of cleansing conditioner before but by far this in the best. I ordered it because I couldn&#x27;t find it at the store and I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this! My hair is thick, naturally wavy and somewhat coarse. This product makes my hair so shiny, and super soft. My scalp feels much &#x27;cleaner&#x27; than when I &#x27;wash&#x27; using only conditioner. I strongly suggest you try this.</li>
    <li> I love the 2 in 1 concept. This works but my hair did not feel clean and it smells horrid. I prefer the herbal essences version</li>
    <li> This product seems to soften my hair and not strip color or natural oils.  I really like it, although I need to use a lot (around 10 pumps) for my somewhat long (to my collarbone) hair.  Hair does begin to appear oily if not washed daily, so those who like to skip a day will need to take that into consideration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After tiring of that oily second-day look, I started washing my hair first with an inexpensive Pantene variety, and did a second washing with this cleansing conditioner.  Perfect!  Clean soft hair for more than one day. :)</li>
    <li> Just washed my hair. Nice product but could have been nicer. It has a lot of alcohol and left my head skin feel cold but it does not have menthol in ingredients. Probably hair will be oily soon. Will see.</li>
    <li> The synthetic scent is awful. I am chucking it just for that. Terrible, terrible. I have to write more words.</li>
    <li> I  have tried several cleansing conditioners and this is my favorite. It has a little bit a of lather, not much, just enough to feel like it is cleaning. It leaves a pleasant scalp tingle and has a nice but subtle scent. It leaves my hair soft and tangle free. I used to be able to find it cheaper locally but not anymore so I was happy to find it here.</li>
    <li> I started using Wen several months ago, and loved it, except for the price.  I decided to try a cheaper version, and that is exactly what this was.  A cheaper version.  I tried it several times, and it never left my hair feeling soft and smooth like the Wen.  For the price, you might as well give it a try, but I think I will be throwing the rest of my bottle away.</li>
    <li> It does a great job of cleaning without drying out my hair...I find it works well in-between shampoos in the winter when my hair is even drier....I do need to use quite a bit to feel like my hair is clean however,  The low sudsy aspect might contribute to how much I use.  If it worked with less per shampoo, I&#x27;d be happier but it fills a niche.</li>
    <li> I like this product but I don&#x27;t like the cool tingle sensation on my surrounding skin. made me break out in a rash.</li>
    <li> I have tried many Cleansing Conditioners over the past few months, and I love the Pantene line.  I use the damage repair and the cleansing conditioner for color-treated hair.  This has a nice smell, and really cleans hair.  I use this one or the color protect product every other day, and I use a regular shampoo/conditioner on the days I don&#x27;t use this product.  My oily hair comes out clean, shiny, and soft when I use this product, not greasy like some other cleansing conditioners. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this pump - SO much easier than L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s imitation Wen which is too small.  Does a good job.</li>
    <li> Great product. Same quality as Wen at much, much lower price.</li>
    <li> Brought this for my daughter. Her hair is natural and this cleanses and moisturizes great. Wish I had ordered several is this is a add on product and could not order it by itself.</li>
    <li> You can feel the silkiness it&#x27;s going to accomplish AS you are using it.</li>
    <li> The best cleansing conditioner I have tried so far. Smells great, makes the scalp feel tingly, and leaves hair smooth.</li>
    <li> Overall this did get my hair clean, but nothing spectacular or better than other cleansing conditioners I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m not too crazy about the scent of this product, but it&#x27;s definitely not a bad smell either. My main complaint with this is that it made my head very cold. Definitely wouldn&#x27;t want to use this in the winter. I&#x27;m not sure what it is that&#x27;s in this particular Pantene, but it feels like menthol or a product like Icy Hot or something similar. Everyone&#x27;s different, but for me personally this alone was enough to make me not want to repurchase this product. I suppose it may work well after working out, or on a hot summer day when you&#x27;re trying to cool down, but it&#x27;s definitely a different and unique cooling sensation that I&#x27;ve never experienced with any other shampoo or conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great product and arrived ahead of expected date.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It left my hair feeling much cleaner and softer than with other cleansing conditioners.  I have thin, fine, curly, colored (premature graying), fragile hair that feels like straw and breaks off if I shampoo too frequently.  This left my hair feeling really soft, shiny, and looking really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those reading this review, it will be more as a comparison with Wen. I have been a &amp;#34;cowasher&amp;#34; for years, and a Wen girl for going on ten years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cowashing is washing your hair with a large amount of conditioner. This is especially useful for people with curly, colored, long or fragile hair. I only have luck with the Sweet Almond Mint in the Wen line, and I really love it, but as others have stated, it carries a hefty price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first use, my hair felt really soft.  I used 6 pumps on my shoulder length hair. It felt really nice on the scalp. Unsure of what to expect, I let my hair dry naturally without any leave in conditioner or any other product just to see how it would turn out. My hair was a bit frizzy once upon drying (compared with Wen, but not as much as with shampoo.  Also, I am in a humid environment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second day - my scalp still felt clean and there was no &amp;#34;scalp smell&amp;#34;, and I did not feel like my hair had to be washed to feel or smell clean. It looked reasonably well without styling.  This, for me, is where it is better than Wen.  With Wen, I still get the scalp smell by the next day, and it definitely feels like it needs to be washed - even using a dry shampoo.  While I am not a huge fan of the Pantene&#x27;s smell, it does last longer, and my hair felt cleaner longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third day - my hair and scalp actually still felt pretty clean, and I probably would have been fine with using a dry shampoo, but I wanted to use this stuff again :D, and for the price of this product, what the hey.  Again, it felt really nice on my hair &amp; scalp. Afterwards, I applied a quarter sized amount (of the same product, the Pantene cleansing conditioner) to my still wet hair as a leave in conditioner/styling creme. I was a bit sceptical as to how it would turn out because of the dimethicone, but it turned out really well, and my hair looked fuller than if nothing had been added. It also was not frizzy, even on a humid day. In this regard, it is very similar to Wen, which can also be used as a leave in treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day four - again, hair and scalp still felt clean, not like it had to be washed (until after a sweaty workout).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still love Wen, but ounce for ounce, dollar for dollar - I&#x27;m probably going to be a Pantene girl going forward. The results really are pretty comparible, but the price of Pantene is much more wallet-friendly.  It would be nice for this to be available in a 32ounce size or larger.  Not crazy about the smell - wish it had a more &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; kind of smell, but overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and quite excited to have something of this quality for the price.mount (of the same product, the Pantene cleansing conditioner) to my still wet hair as a leave in conditioner/styling creme.

    <li> This product performs ok..I just can&#x27;t get past the smell! It&#x27;s really awful.  I keep forcing myself to use it because I don&#x27;t want to throw money away, but it is darn near gag worthy.</li>
    <li> Love it makes my hair really soft and healthy</li>
    <li> I switched to the sulfate free shampoos a while ago, but found most of them so costly to buy and use as the instructions had you using up to 15 pumps per wash!  This Pantene is great, thick, smells lovely and best thing ..you only use 3 to 4 pumps !!! Leaves my hair feeling so soft and the smell lingers most of the day too.  The price is affordable and I will certainly be buying this from now on.</li>
    <li> So exciting.  After 44 years I finally found something great AND budget friendly.  I have very thick, curly, (frizzy) dry hair.  I have tried every moisturizing shampoo / conditioner.  On a whim I tried Wen (at the introductory special) and it did wonders but was hit by sticker shock when it was time for a refill so I cancelled my subscription.  I tried RenPure which was awful, then bought this.  Upon the first use my hair looks the best it has ever looked!  It&#x27;s thick (like Wen) which is what my hair needs and the price point is excellent.</li>
    <li> Compared to Wen this product needs extra conditioner...too drying</li>
    <li> Ok, to be fair I liked it at first.  I have long, fine hair that tends to be dry.  Most heavy conditioners weigh it down, but this product rinsed clean.  My hair was softer, had more body, and fewer frizzies.  Something about this product irritates my scalp.  It gets very dry &amp; itchy.  It&#x27;s borderline dandruff at this point, which is not something I&#x27;ve had a problem with for 20 years.  I have no known allergies to fragrances or cosmetic ingredients.  Bummer, because I really like the effect on my  hair.  *edit*  Full blown psoriasis per my stylist.  You know it&#x27;s bad when they say Aveda can&#x27;t help you.  You need a medicated shampoo.  What is up with that Pantene?</li>
    <li> Best product for dry curly hair</li>
    <li> Excellent for dry, damaged hair. It conditions very well, making hair much smoother and more manageable, like it used to be years ago. It&#x27;s just like the infomercial kind without the high cost. Love it!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!! MAKES MY HAIR SO SOFT. I TRIED RENPURE.......TERRIBLE. PANTENE CLEANSING CONDITIONER IS MY NEW HAIR CLEANSER. I STILL USE A LEAVE IN CONDITIONER AS MY HAIR IS LONG, THICK AND DRY. FAST DELIVERY. I RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I have fine hair that I&#x27;m forever trying to &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; up.  This really helped.</li>
    <li> I have used this three times and each time I have not been able to get it out of my hair.  Last time I only used one pump for my hair halfway down my back and I have now shampooed without conditioner three times and I can&#x27;t get the greasy gunky feeling out of my hair.  Definitely throwing this away.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I was afraid it would be too drying or over moisturizing. It&#x27;s got the perfect balance. I don&#x27;t mind the smell and I find the tingle on my scalp enjoyable.</li>
    <li> The same results as Wen for one tenth the price.</li>
    <li> It was ok when I used it, it didn&#x27;t leave my hair in that great condition and left some residue. It may be better for the summer when your hair won&#x27;t dry out as quickly.&lt;br /&gt;What I really didn&#x27;t like was that the ingredients are many various alcohols which denature proteins and dry out your hair. The alcohol is so high in concentration that you can smell it when you open the bottle.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t start to use but it smells so good</li>
    <li> Great product,  woorks very well. Worth the money. Shipping was fast and packaged well.</li>
    <li> Just what I expect from Pantene.  When I saw this new product I immediately ordered 3 bottles.  I don&#x27;t like regular shampoos, they make my hair brittle and it breaks easily.  I used WEN cleansing conditioners for years. I stopped using them about a year ago because I didn&#x27;t think it was worth the high price.  3 - 16.9 oz. bottles of Pantene cost less than 1 - 16 oz. bottle of WEN.  Now that I&#x27;ve tried Pentene cleansing conditioner I like it much better than WEN.  My medium length fine, dry, curly, damaged hair has bounce and shine now.  My hair is fuller, manageable with no frizzies.  Unlike with WEN that left it looking limp and dull.  I mentioned I have dry hair but my bangs get oily due to the oil on my face.  This cleans oily hair wonderfully too!  To clean hair, be sure to use enough product and massage into scalp and throughout hair.  Here&#x27;s another tip - I keep a bottle of Pantene beside my sink to wash my hands.  It leaves them soft with no need for hand lotion.</li>
    <li> This a wonderful and cheap solution to Wen&#x27;s cleansing conditioner</li>
    <li> UPDATE. I was loving this product until I started having serious breakage problems. My hair was dry on the ends with so many fly-always I even tried using argan oil products to smooth it out. My hairdresser solved the problem letting me know that Pantene products are notorious for causing breakage and hair loss. She switched me to a higher quality cleansing conditioner and I can honestly say she is right. My fine, color treated hair is recovering nicely with less breakage, frizz and dry ends. Stay away from this stuff.</li>
    <li> Love - definitly makes my hair softer and more curls - struggled all my life to have bouncy soft curls!</li>
    <li> I had to return this because it DRIED my hair out. I don&#x27;t understand how people use this and think its softening your hair. I have been using sulfate-free shampoos for years, and in comparison, this was much more drying/damaging.</li>
    <li> I got this as a &amp;#34;gift with purchase&amp;#34; sort of deal, but it was so fabulous for my hair that I am going to be buying from now on. Even at full price it was cheaper than WEN products. It really did re-moisturize my hair (with natural sweet almond oil), and it didn&#x27;t leave a greasy or limp feeling at all. My hair feels softer. I even noticed less split ends after only the first use ! And the scent was a nice &amp;#34;clean/fresh&amp;#34; one that wasn&#x27;t too strong. I think this has made me a new convert to the &amp;#34;shampoo-less&amp;#34; cleaning of hair movement.</li>
    <li> I love this. I tried the other TV expensive brand but couldn&#x27;t justify the cost.  The Pantene is so much cheaper but I love the add on price.  It makes my hair feel just as good as the expensive brand.  It&#x27;s worth a try for anyone looking for a new way to clean your hair.  I have curly, just above the shoulder hair and use two pumps each day to cleanse my hair.</li>
    <li> I love pantene! I have used the shampoo and conditione for years.  I have very long hair (30 inches) and have become interested in cleansing conditioners but didn&#x27;t want to fork out all the cash required for a Wen system.  I am very happy with the Pantene. It has greatly reduced the tangles and I love that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel stripped like it does with shampoo. I also use it on my grandsons hair. He is mixed and has coarse curly hair. When I use this product the result for him is big beautiful soft curls. I love it!</li>
    <li> very good. And I like it.</li>
    <li> cleans well and keeps my scalp moisturized - not itchy</li>
    <li> Nice for curly girls. Im a 3c and a lot of the &amp;quot;natural hair&amp;quot; products dont work for me, they are too heavy. this is awesome. my hair feels clean something i dont get from most cowashes for AA hair. Its shiny and not weighed down. it even was good after a swim.</li>
    <li> Im 44 and have been coloring my hair for almost 20 years. Tried wen and didnt care for it. I have ALOT of hair but it&#x27;s very fine and grows very fast. With fine hair you have to wash it daily and with it growing so fast, I have to color often (some salon but mostly box dye, i know, bad bad bad).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One use and I was amazed. Dryer crunchy hair turned soft and silky. Very very impressed. I hope they keep making it. Im worried, the stuff I love,they quit making. I&#x27;m going to also try the color save one although i didnt notice any loss in color with this formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the try</li>
    <li> Did not clean my hair.  Left hair dull and gummy.  Had to rewash hair with my regular shampoo.  Also it was way too &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34;, feels uncomfortable tingly on scalp.</li>
    <li> Good value great product</li>
    <li> works just a good as wen and is a whole lot cheaper!!! Will def be purchasing this from now on.</li>
    <li> This works just as good if not better than the high dollar name brand. My hair is really thick and this product brought t my natural curls back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cleansers by Chaz Dean (Wen) for years.  And they are so expensive!  So when I ran out I tried this on a whim because Amazon could get it here quicker than the shopping channel.  Turns out that this works better on my fine, straight, uncolored hair way better than the extremely expensive other option.  I get all the results that Chaz says you should, but I never got ALL of them.  With this product, my hair is smooth, soft, and tangle free.  Even my husband noticed a difference!  And I had been using Wen for over 5 years!  So if you&#x27;re a Wen girl, but hate the price tag...give this a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many cleansing conditioners.  Herbal Essence, L&#x27;oreal, Lisa Rachel, Coconut Cowash.  With that said, I love the pump design, it makes it very easy to pump the right amount (unlike some other products).  The smell is pleasant.  And overall, I found this to be one of the better cleansing conditioners for my hair (fine, frizzy/wavy hair).  I have yet to try Wen.  But considering the price and my results, I think I&#x27;ll continue using this bran....I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!!  I have dry hair and a thyroid condition so I am always looking for a shampoo that will condition and clean well!  This does the job well at a excellent price!!  I highly recommend!!</li>
