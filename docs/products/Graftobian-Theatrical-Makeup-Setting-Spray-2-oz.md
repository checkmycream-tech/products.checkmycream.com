      <li>plus the pigmentation in my blush and eyeshadows are just as perfect at the end of the day thanks to this spray.</li>
      <li>/&gt;this is by FAR, the best setting spray.</li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t love it, but I want to keep trying and see if perhaps I can make it work.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t like that I can feel the sting (lack of better words) of alcohol.</li>
      <li>and I love the dewy effect it gives me, Makeup rubbing off is a No-No for this setting spray.</li>

      <li>I must say fantastic for both.</li>
      <li>also came super fast and packaged nice.</li>
      <li>Now a clean screen and the makeup stays on my face.</li>
      <li>TO FIND THIS AT SUCH A FAIR P;RICE</li>
      <li>IVE PAID MUCH MORE FOR A LOT LESS OF A GOOD JOB</li>
      <li>It melted my waterproof mascara right off my eyes too.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells exactly like hairspray too-not a problem, just useful information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so much so that sweat was dripping in my eyes (yuck!)</li>
      <li>Not in any sense of the word does it &amp;#34;work.&amp;#34; The spray is too powerful, so it really hits you in the face.</li>
      <li>First of all, it sprays out and gets all over your face and looks like hairspray on your face.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much better the Urban and Ben Nye in my opinion.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>You can feel it actually working its magic once u mist it on.</li>
      <li>The first time I tried this I couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
      <li>(it was hot here in California)</li>
      <li>this stuff is NOT shiny or cake like or even sticky or wet.it dry&#x27;s  nice and fast keeping my makeup in place ALL DAY LONG:).</li>
      <li>It really works make up stayed on all day and it was hot.</li>
      <li>People with dry or combination skin may have better luck with it,</li>
      <li>IT REALLY DOES THE JOB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!LOVE</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>I didnt find it to really help...</li>
      <li>It shipped so fast to me</li>
      <li>I am a transgender man who frequently has to do my face in order to look right.</li>
      <li>I now occasionally use it for daily wear and am satisfied.</li>
      <li>all day - High humidity is no match.</li>
      <li>Not only am I unable to leave the house without this on top of my makeup, my clients are ecstatic!!!</li>
      <li>I learned about this product from multiple YouTube videos and it worked even better than expected.</li>
      <li>Could see no difference when using and felt like you were taking a shower since the pump emitted such large droplets.</li>
      <li>It smells a bit like hairspray, but it feel natural when it dries.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how I was without this for so long REALLY!</li>
      <li>So I was looking for a good makeup setting spray without the expensive price</li>
      <li>Your skin will feel stiff to the touch, but it doesn&#x27;t crease and is perfectly comfortable.</li>
      <li>It works really well, but it gives a little sticky feeling and a bit of a sting when it first goes on.</li>
      <li>I attempted to send it back but because it is liquid there are special shipping requirements and not worth the hassle.</li>
      <li>For one, temps are easily in the 90&#x27;s, sweaty, hot, humid, and anything before to set makeup failed -and rubbed off onto the camera display screen.</li>
      <li>usually my makeup will crease into my fine lines on my forehead and under my eyes by mid day - but not anymore.</li>
      <li>Used it initially for halloween where I was dressed as a &#x27;dia de los muertos&#x27; with a full face of heavy makeup and nothing was smudged by the end of the night.</li>
      <li>my bare face let dry few min clean the air gun.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just as good as the expensive stuff, for not even 1/3 the price!</li>
      <li>My only complaint is if you don&#x27;t fully suppress the bottle spray, the mist doesn&#x27;t have enough gusto and comes out in big droplets rather than a fine mist.</li>
      <li>I put my makeup on and trying spraying it, it went into a single stream and nearly glued my eyes shut.</li>
      <li>I broke out in a spot where I sprayed a little too much.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It tends to make my skin look a little too shinny after I&#x27;ve gently sprayed it over my makeup</li>

<li> Plus it is very drying and makes your skin dry and tight.</li>
<li> I suggest when you spray this on, you close your eyes, use 2-4 sprays only at about 4-6 inches away from your face and while it&#x27;s drying, you constantly move your face and open and close your mouth or it will dry and your face will feel like it&#x27;s going to crack.</li>

<li> I have tried luminess final seal and other items</li>
<li> /&gt;Personally, it just works if I&#x27;m only wearing makeup for just a few hours.</li>
<li> Be careful spraying it over eye makeup as it does contain alcohol, just wait a bit to open you eyes for a few seconds.</li>
<li> It is also not a fine enough mist, so you feel soaked after one spritz.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m buying my 3rd refill and have no idea why I wasted my money at Sephora on other products.</li>
<li> Worked extremely well!</li>
<li> i decided to give this a try only because i was sick of spending SO much money on other brands of setting sprays.&lt;br /&gt;after</li>
<li> Holds makeup on like glue but feels a little sticky as its drying.</li>
<li> My make-up stayed in place usually im a sweaty mess not this time....</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past.</li>
<li> I was cooking, decorating and throwing a party this past weekend</li>
<li> It makes my face hard and crunchy.</li>
<li> It is hard to get off.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells a lot like hairspray. Going to try it out again and see. It works well at setting but I&#x27;m afraid it might be overpowering.</li>
    <li> This is the best spray out there to set make-up. I will not be purchasing anymore $25-$35 make-up setting sprays because this works just like it!  All I did was poured it into one of those $32 bottles and sprayed - it worked like a charm!!! Try this product because it can&#x27;t hurt, it&#x27;s only a couple a dollars, not $32!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice but not the best stuff I have used.</li>
    <li> this product is terrible. It dries and is flaky and scaly.  It looks terrible and doesn&#x27;t dry evenly.  Idk if it is my pumper is bad and making product come out thick in globs or this is the way it is sold.  I attempted to send it back but because it is liquid there are special shipping requirements and not worth the hassle.</li>
    <li> IT REALLY DOES THE JOB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!LOVE THIS  IVE PAID MUCH MORE FOR A LOT LESS OF A GOOD JOB&lt;br /&gt;THRILLED TO FIND THIS AT SUCH A FAIR P;RICE</li>
    <li> It works in humidity here in Florida!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it made my makeup stay longer, so that sucks. I purchased it because I saw a video review of it on Instagram and it held up against water. So I&#x27;ll keep giving it a try. I don&#x27;t like that I can feel the sting (lack of better words) of alcohol. Like, you can feel it on your face and smell it. That&#x27;s off putting. So if you have website skin</li>
    <li> Honestly, this isn&#x27;t the best setting spray out there. I bought it, thinking it would set my paint and seal it, and my paint still came off. Would not order this again, nor would i recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> It really works make up stayed on all day and it was hot. The only problem was were my hair was on my face didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This makeup setting spray is comparable to Ben Nye&#x27;s Makeup Setting Spray. It is alcohol based which in my opinion is better than a water based setting spray. It works great to preserve your makeup. I am constantly touching my face and having makeup transfer from your fingers to papers or anything else is not a good look, so using this setting spray is a necessity. I suggest when you spray this on, you close your eyes, use 2-4 sprays only at about 4-6 inches away from your face and while it&#x27;s drying, you constantly move your face and open and close your mouth or it will dry and your face will feel like it&#x27;s going to crack. ;-D the things we do for beauty!!</li>
    <li> I broke out in a spot where I sprayed a little too much.  I&#x27;ll return to Mehron</li>
    <li> This product simply does not work- Not in any sense of the word does it &amp;#34;work.&amp;#34; The spray is too powerful, so it really hits you in the face. It is also not a fine enough mist, so you feel soaked after one spritz. It melted my waterproof mascara right off my eyes too. And to top it off, after I tried talking and smiled, it started flaking off my face in areas where the spray had gone on in drops. Don&#x27;t buy this. I should have gotten Ben Nye&#x27;s &#x27;Final Seal,&#x27; or Kat Von D&#x27;s &#x27;Lock n Load&#x27; like I planned. This stuff is terrible.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff. It makes my makeup last all day and doesn&#x27;t feel like hairspray on your face. It smells a bit like hairspray, but it feel natural when it dries. I&#x27;ve never found a better setting spray. I was cooking, decorating and throwing a party this past weekend (it was hot here in California) and I was sweating like crazy, so much so that sweat was dripping in my eyes (yuck!) and my makeup stayed put, even my false lashes and non-water proof eye makeup didn&#x27;t run! Be careful spraying it over eye makeup as it does contain alcohol, just wait a bit to open you eyes for a few seconds. I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> It works like a dream. Good partner pick for your makeup you want to set.</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutelu terrible. First of all, it sprays out and gets all over your face and looks like hairspray on your face. It is hard to get off. I put my makeup on and trying spraying it, it went into a single stream and nearly glued my eyes shut. The burning was so bad that I had to shower and rinse my eyes for ten minutes. I think the best bet would be an aeosol can. Yes, if it only gets on your eyes, it keeps the eyeshadow on, but the way it sprays out, just awful</li>
    <li> It makes my face hard and crunchy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past. It holds the makeup on well so that it doesn&#x27;t sweat off when performing on stage.</li>
    <li> Like hairspray for your face. Holds makeup on like glue but feels a little sticky as its drying. Used it initially for halloween where I was dressed as a &#x27;dia de los muertos&#x27; with a full face of heavy makeup and nothing was smudged by the end of the night. I now occasionally use it for daily wear and am satisfied.</li>
    <li> I didnt find it to really help... I would suggest Model in a bottle before this product.</li>
    <li> i decided to give this a try only because i was sick of spending SO much money on other brands of setting sprays.&lt;br /&gt;after trying this, i dont understand what those sprays even did?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is by FAR, the best setting spray. usually my makeup will crease into my fine lines on my forehead and under my eyes by mid day - but not anymore. plus the pigmentation in my blush and eyeshadows are just as perfect at the end of the day thanks to this spray. i will continue to use this forever.</li>
    <li> I tend to have oily skin and I find that this product doesn&#x27;t work as well as I would have hoped for long periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tends to make my skin look a little too shinny after I&#x27;ve gently sprayed it over my makeup so I end up having to put another layer of powder ontop to get rid of the shine, which sort of defeats the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using it before work but after eight hours at work my makeup tends to smudge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells exactly like hairspray too-not a problem, just useful information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, it just works if I&#x27;m only wearing makeup for just a few hours. People with dry or combination skin may have better luck with it,</li>
    <li> Love this setting spray!  My makeup stays put and I I have oily skin!! It&#x27;s much better the Urban and Ben Nye in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Love it i went dancing. My make-up stayed in place usually im a sweaty mess not this time.... Thank you</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as great as I thought I would. I use this as a final mist in my airbrush machine and my makeup lasts just the same as when i don&#x27;t use it. Plus it is very drying and makes your skin dry and tight.</li>
    <li> Worked extremely well! Very good for cosplay and or for any makeup on a day to day basis. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> It smells and feels like hairspray on my face and actually made my foundation break up a bit. I don&#x27;t love it, but I want to keep trying and see if perhaps I can make it work.</li>
    <li> I dont see where this item made my makeup stay on any longer...it also smells like it is nothing more than hairspray and felt like it was clogging my pores</li>
    <li> I thought it would be holding the color better.</li>
    <li> This is awesome. Nothing compares. It&#x27;s just as good as the expensive stuff, for not even 1/3 the price! great!</li>
    <li> I am a transgender man who frequently has to do my face in order to look right. I haven&#x27;t started permanent physical changes yet, so I have to rely on makeup and proper dress. Let me just say that I was set up to be disappointed. I&#x27;ve been at this 24/7 for about three months now and I have found nothing that will keep my face ON my face yet and I&#x27;ve tried a lot. This stuff is THE S***. I will definitely be buying it again until I pass enough that I don&#x27;t need makeup anymore. It burns a little going on, but I&#x27;ve had the same makeup on for the last eight hours, no touch-ups, and I have accidentally brushed my face several times and NOTHING HAS COME OFF. This stuff is a miracle. Forget that fifty-dollar junk that doesn&#x27;t do nearly as good a job. This stuff WORKS.</li>
    <li> I learned about this product from multiple YouTube videos and it worked even better than expected. For Halloween this year I used a ton of bright shadows and glitter and none of it budged or faded as I danced the night away. Your skin will feel stiff to the touch, but it doesn&#x27;t crease and is perfectly comfortable. This would be great to seal face-painting on kids.</li>
    <li> Well it came in crappy packaging and broke open in the package also was cloudy and gross !! Absolutely not happy! Won&#x27;t repurchase from this site</li>
    <li> It dries my skin so bad, it looks like if I put hair spray on my face&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this buy...</li>
    <li> This product is just as good as Ben Nye&#x27;s version.  Doesn&#x27;t have that nice minty smell, but it gets the job done!!  ;)</li>
    <li> I bought the wrong thing and boy am I glad I did. Being a makeup Artist I set out looking for a setting spray that would set set set. This product has met my  expectations and more. Not only am I unable to leave the house without this on top of my makeup, my clients are ecstatic!!! I will be purchasing this forever!!!!!! Thank you!!!!!</li>
    <li> So I was looking for a good makeup setting spray without the expensive price and I came across this product I read the only 2 reviews the product had and I was skeptical because not many ppl wrote reviews on it. Anyway I bought it. OMG! This Stuff is awesome, It lives up to its Hype but not too many ppl know about it. It shipped so fast to me I started using it immediatly and my makeup as been flawless and I love the dewy effect it gives me, Makeup rubbing off is a No-No for this setting spray. You can feel it actually working its magic once u mist it on. Wish I could give it 10 Stars!</li>
    <li> It works really well, but it gives a little sticky feeling and a bit of a sting when it first goes on.</li>
    <li> Could see no difference when using and felt like you were taking a shower since the pump emitted such large droplets.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m buying my 3rd refill and have no idea why I wasted my money at Sephora on other products. This is cheaper and does what it&#x27;s actually supposed to. I discovered this brand when I started looking into what TV/Movie professionals wore to look flawless on HD screens. I am a wedding photographer and shoot all day - High humidity is no match. When I look in the mirror after a 10+ hour shoot - my makeup is flawless. The first time I tried this I couldn&#x27;t believe it. For one, temps are easily in the 90&#x27;s, sweaty, hot, humid, and anything before to set makeup failed -and rubbed off onto the camera display screen. Now a clean screen and the makeup stays on my face. Lifer of this product. My only complaint is if you don&#x27;t fully suppress the bottle spray, the mist doesn&#x27;t have enough gusto and comes out in big droplets rather than a fine mist. If this happens I just blot with a beauty blender and done.</li>
    <li> I am truly very happy with this product I do wear airbrush makeup as well as regular foundation. I must say fantastic for both. the airbrush brands I wear are water based like glam air , graftobian and luminess I  know you can use this setting spray with any one of these airbrush brands. I can best put it like this I actually have put this in my airbrush system works grate I put a thin layer((evenly and not holding the air gun so close))))))on my bare face let dry few min clean the air gun. follow  the rest of makeup steps at my final step  was to apply again OVER my makeup....I must say its just perfect it sets my airbrush makeup like never before it looks flawless I don&#x27;t know how I was without this for so long REALLY! I have tried luminess final seal and other items they were kind of just blah nothing to write about .this stuff is the best the price and amount  is a steal. this stuff is NOT shiny or cake like or even sticky or wet.it dry&#x27;s  nice and fast keeping my makeup in place ALL DAY LONG:). also came super fast and packaged nice.</li>
