      <li>Feels great to be saving the money I am saving!</li>

      <li>but at this awesome price i can change it.</li>

      <li>They are great...</li>
      <li>Thank you for manufacturingthese great products.</li>

      <li>My favorite feature of this razor is the great audio feedback I get when shaving.  </li>
      <li>LOVE IT!  </li>
      <li>best  blades I&#x27;ve ever used, sharpest, clean easy</li>
      <li>After using these for a while though, I&#x27;ve learned how to use them effectively.</li>
      <li>Cheaper, and just as effective.</li>
      <li>No visible razor burn, my head just kind of burns.</li>
      <li>Great blades, great price, fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I get a nice shave every time.  </li>
      <li>These are just as good (maybe better) and a lot more affordable.</li>
      <li>I have used your 6 blade and 3 blade systems, and they both work fine and are a good value.</li>
      <li>Works great and well worth the price.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not even sure if it was intentional or not, but for me it put this razor in a class of its own.    </li>
      <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
      <li>But they hold up better than the disposable variety and just as well in my opinion as the Schick or Gillette ones I used to buy.    </li>
      <li>Love the razor and the blades- better than the stuff in the store.</li>
      <li>I shave my head and this razor glides across giving me a better shave than the Mach 3 did.  </li>
      <li>My last one seemed like the perfect shave!  </li>
      <li>The more I used it, the better the shaves seemed to get.  </li>
      <li>I have been using dorco shaving for three years now and love it.</li>
      <li>but, way better price...</li>
      <li>One more thing...</li>
      <li>Thank you for a great product at a reasonable price</li>
      <li>but i think it could go a couple more shaves</li>
      <li>you couldn&#x27;t ask for a better razor.  </li>
      <li>I have been a user of disposals for many years but my favorite has been discontinued.  </li>
      <li>Would love to be writing a 5-star review on these.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably try the Dorco 6-blade system and see if results are any better.</li>
      <li>: I wanted to love the Dorco 3-blade razors.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly suprised in that Dorco razor and blades were relatively inexpensive and superior than the Gillete Trac that I was using.</li>
      <li>Far better price than the competition and the quality is good.  </li>
      <li>I am very pleased and highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>The handle is a bit light</li>
      <li>The handle is very well made and is nicely weighted.</li>
      <li>Oh and by the way...the Venus blades DO fit on the Mach handle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been happy with these until recently.</li>
      <li>I hope you will make them available again on Amazon because I am a Prime member entitled to free shipping.</li>
      <li>Awesome Razor, I used to use disposable, heavy beard, 1st tried the 6 blade but changed to the the 3, works well.</li>
      <li>The blades cut close and are comfortable.</li>
      <li>Great handle and blades, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>so far, so good.</li>
      <li>The shave is smooth and clean.  </li>
      <li>$3.65 per cartridge    ORIGINAL</li>
      <li>In all fairness, I&#x27;m using the triple blades, I wanted to compare directly to my Mach 3, the Dorcos with more than 3 blades may work much better...</li>
      <li>When I added the blades, they got stuck and the razor would not move, therefore not getting a clean shave.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it for a very smooth, comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>If I then try to shave with a Dorco 3-blade cartridge that I&#x27;ve used a few times already, the results aren&#x27;t very good.</li>
      <li>These are great razors that are much cheaper than the major brands.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I quit throwing away so much money on brand name blades.</li>
      <li>The full functionality of a Mach 3 at a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>Good prices, solid razors.</li>
      <li>Overall, Dorco 6-blade performance is every bit as good as higher-priced Gillette Schick et al.    </li>
      <li>I used and appreciated the Atra Plus for many years.</li>
      <li>Overall it does a good job at an unbeatable price.  </li>
      <li>These Dorcos work good on my head when they are new, but not so much after a couple shaves.</li>
      <li>I give credit to Dorco Customer Service for quickly replying to my review.</li>
      <li>I read really good reviews about these razors, they are the EXACT same razor that Dollar Shave Club uses...</li>
      <li>I shaved 15 times over one month with a Dorco 6-blade cartridge before deciding to replace it with a fresh cartridge.</li>
      <li>I expected a fairly good razor.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth trying.  </li>
      <li>It is stunning to see the price difference from drugstore brands (gillette , etc).&lt;br /&gt;Doric are the same quality but at a significant price differential. .</li>
      <li>I have heavier than average facial hair so that is impressive.</li>
      <li>The shaver handle has a nice weight and feel to it, taking me back many years to the double edge safety razor days.  </li>
      <li>So be smart and don t overpay!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>So I ordered the starter kit (with handle) the first time.  </li>
      <li>I had to buy a replacement because my first one fell apart.</li>

    <li> I have been a user of disposals for many years but my favorite has been discontinued.  In searching for a replacement I came across the Dorco system and decided to give it a try.  The shaver handle has a nice weight and feel to it, taking me back many years to the double edge safety razor days.  The razor cartridge is doing a great job too.  I am very pleased and highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Dollar shave club minus the middle man. Good prices, solid razors.</li>
    <li> These blades are smoother, sharper, and last longer than the big name brands.  They are also less expensive.</li>
    <li> good razors. good price. no complaints.</li>
    <li> Really like these razor. Affordable and equal in quality to Mach III blades in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Great blades, Great shave, Thxs. !!</li>
    <li> great razors at an unbeatable price</li>
    <li> Great handle and blades, especially for the price. The handle is very well made and is nicely weighted. The blades cut close and are comfortable. One small annoyance is that the blade head is pretty large, which makes it difficult to shave the area directly under the nose. After using these for a while though, I&#x27;ve learned how to use them effectively. I would recommend these to friends and family.</li>
    <li> those blades are cheaper than any other that s why I using them only once a week and don t need to be worry to reorder them again. Comparing to Gillette blades the only difference is you can save money on those. So be smart and don t overpay!</li>
    <li> This company has great customer service. Their razor and blades are good also. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Such a fine product for people who want a smooth close shave without the high cost. This is my 4th order. I shave 3 times a week and 1 blade does the job but i think it could go a couple more shaves but at this awesome price i can change it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I did some research and found that this is the company that makes some of the razors for one of those online subscription razor sites. So I ordered the starter kit (with handle) the first time.  I ordered this after about 6 months when I used all 8 of those.  These are a very good quality and last me a few weeks (2-3) of shaving both my face &amp; my head.  Since my job requires me to be at work for 48 hours straight, I have a handle for home and one for work so I split this between both places.  But they hold up better than the disposable variety and just as well in my opinion as the Schick or Gillette ones I used to buy.    I will continue to buy these.</li>
    <li> This Blade System is Excellent 3 weeks on 1 blade price is reasonable Great Shave !!! Good Bye Gillette  Mach 3</li>
    <li> best  blades I&#x27;ve ever used, sharpest, clean easy, one bit of advice is let the razor do the job, you press a lot less with these as they are so much sharper. i usually trade blades every 4 days, sometimes i go two weeks before i change out the blades. and the handle is best, well textured, usually i look at the handles and say did any body actually shave with this, not so with this handle. i keep well stocked up so i will never run out.</li>
    <li> Good quality blades for the price, these really are all anyone ever needs.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like these, but the quality is just not there.  The Gillette blades are much sharper and give me a better shave with less irritation.  Also, the Gillette blades last longer, so I wind up with a better shave for about he same money.  Another problem is customer service.  You might not need it much, but I called Gillette once after trying out Sensor Excel cartridges that I didn&#x27;t like, and they gave me a couple packages of Mach 3 Turbo cartridges free and did not ask for the Sensors back.  I called Dorco earlier this year after receiving the wrong blades from them, and it was a back and forth email nightmare.  I finally gave up and I told them I was going back to the sharper Gillettes, and a couple weeks later I got an email offering to replace the blades as long as I shipped the others back to them first.  I decided to give the crap to a homeless person.  Two stars for the hefty handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS.  This is Ellen&#x27;s husband.</li>
    <li> I expected a fairly good razor. I was pleasantly suprised in that Dorco razor and blades were relatively inexpensive and superior than the Gillete Trac that I was using. Thank you for manufacturingthese great products. Larry</li>
    <li> Still trying them out</li>
    <li> To me, these are better than the 6 blade system, they may be the best 3 blade razors that I have ever used.  They glide over my facial hair better than i could have hoped.  I shave every other day which led to some tugging with the 6 blade cartridge.  With the three blade it is no issue.  These have far exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> I have bought a much more expensive shaving system for years!!!.....bought these and get the same performance out of them that I did out of my Schick Hydro....will buy again!!</li>
    <li> bought a years supply at one go, now into eight months and to report... Good blades (not great, but...) and when kept clean and clear they last quite well.  The handle is a bit light but I can deal with that.&lt;br /&gt;Saved tons of money and never noticed a reduction of the quality of the shave, and that says it all...</li>
    <li> EDIT: After My lackluster review of the Dorco 3-blade cartridges, Dorco Customer Service sent me a set of 6-blade cartridges with handle. My 2-star review of the 3-blade cartridges stands, but I give 5 stars to the 6-blade cartridges. They are great... but then again almost twice the price of the 3-blade option.    I shaved 15 times over one month with a Dorco 6-blade cartridge before deciding to replace it with a fresh cartridge. That&#x27;s terrific performance in my book. The cartridge could have gone longer. Most of my shaves were on several days of stubble, which is something of a tough job on my face. Overall, Dorco 6-blade performance is every bit as good as higher-priced Gillette Schick et al.    Bottom line - Dorco 3-blade cartridges didn&#x27;t work for me, but the 6-blade cartridges are great. Then again the performance is reflected in a substantially higher price for the Dorco 6-blade vs. Dorce 3-blade -- though it&#x27;s still far less expensive than Gillette. By current Amazon prices:    Dorco 3-blade $1.05 per cartridge  Dorco 6-blade $1.92 per cartridge    This compares to:    Gillette Mach3 $2.49 per cartridge  Gillette ProFusion 5-blade $3.65 per cartridge    ORIGINAL: I wanted to love the Dorco 3-blade razors. Was hoping to to be wowed and stick it to the Gillettes and Schicks of the world who shamelessly overcharge for razor cartridges.    Alas. The Dorco shave hasn&#x27;t been that great. It&#x27;s OK but has shortcomings in a few areas. I often go three days or so without shaving. If I then try to shave with a Dorco 3-blade cartridge that I&#x27;ve used a few times already, the results aren&#x27;t very good. I have to resort to a 5-blade Gillette that I have on hand to finish up... the Gillette has quite a bit of use on it, and still cleans up the stubble that the Dorco didn&#x27;t get.    Longevity of the Dorco cartridges is so-so in my experience. Sharp... well, every razor is sharp I suppose. But shaving a two-day stubble with a Dorco 3-blade cartridge on its third or fourth use leaves a lot to be desired.    Maybe I got a bad batch. I&#x27;ll probably try the Dorco 6-blade system and see if results are any better. Would love to be writing a 5-star review on these. Alas, they&#x27;re not much better than a 2-blade razor I can get at the \\&quot;dollar store\\&quot; at 5 for $1.    EDIT: I give credit to Dorco Customer Service for quickly replying to my review. They have sent me a set of 6-blade cartridges. I&#x27;ll update my review once I receive and use those cartridges.</li>
    <li> One of the perks of being retired is that I usually only shave once every 3 to 4 days. That&#x27;s too much for my 2 blade Atra Plus to handle well. I used and appreciated the Atra Plus for many years. I now get a smoother, faster shave with much less irritation using the Dorco 3 blade system. And it is very inexpensive. I can get 7 to 8 shaves before even considering changing the cartridge. I highly recommend it for a very smooth, comfortable shave. But I still use my Atra Plus, which is a bit narrower, to do a final touch-up around the corners of my nose and mouth. This method works very well for me.</li>
    <li> Awesome Razor, I used to use disposable, heavy beard, 1st tried the 6 blade but changed to the the 3, works well. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I have used your 6 blade and 3 blade systems, and they both work fine and are a good value. I was disappointed that the 6 blade system was not available on Amazon which is why I tried the 3 blade razors. I do prefer the 6 blade razor. I hope you will make them available again on Amazon because I am a Prime member entitled to free shipping.</li>
    <li> For the price (compared to Gillette) you couldn&#x27;t ask for a better razor.  The shave is smooth and clean.  The blades last as long, if not longer, than 3 blade Gillette.</li>
    <li> These razors are great. So much cheaper than the cartridges found in stores -- and the quality is just as good if not better. They also seem to last longer.</li>
    <li> These are a great bargain.  I actually bought the wrong blades as I have the Dorco Pace 4.  They still fit and work great!  Thank you for a great product at a reasonable price</li>
    <li> I Switched from a Gillete Mach 3 i&#x27;ve used for years. Cheaper, and just as effective. I will not be switching back.</li>
    <li> These are great razors that are much cheaper than the major brands. I&#x27;ve been using them for a few months now and have no intention of going back. Why buy the name brands with 5 blades when the Dorco 3 blade razors are much cheaper and work just as well?</li>
    <li> My favorite feature of this razor is the great audio feedback I get when shaving.  I can hear the stubble being cut clearly.  Even a small amount of hard to see stubble being cut produces this effect.  When my face is smooth, there is no sound.  Originally it was just the great price that made this razor stand out, but now I think I would truly miss this great feedback if I switched.  Sometimes I have a hard time seeing the very short stubble.  I&#x27;m not even sure if it was intentional or not, but for me it put this razor in a class of its own.    I find it shaves as close as I need it to.  I don&#x27;t get a lot of irritation when shaving either, but I try not to go against the grain.  The blades are fixed and not spring mounted so I am careful to use gentle pressure when shaving with this razor.  I have gotten a few rare minor nicks when using this razor, but I figure it to have been my own user error as I got accustomed to this razor.  The more I used it, the better the shaves seemed to get.  My last one seemed like the perfect shave!  I am using the Pace 4 handle, so I cannot comment on the Pace 3 handle.  The rubber guard and lubricating strip both seem to work well.  Overall it does a good job at an unbeatable price.  If you&#x27;re on the fence about trying it I think you should give it a shot.</li>
    <li> I had ordered the 16 pack Dorco Pace 3 after I had ordered their trial size handel with two blades. I just started on my 2nd blade after 3 months. I&#x27;m just shaving my neck and high cheeks as I have a beard. The blades last as long as my Mach 3, which I think is also a good blade, just double or more in price.&lt;br /&gt;I also learned to shave in the shower, which extends the life of any blade, not to mention my face.</li>
    <li> Why pay high prices in drugstores for razor blades. It is stunning to see the price difference from drugstore brands (gillette , etc).&lt;br /&gt;Doric are the same quality but at a significant price differential. . You will not be giving up comfort or performance. I got my grown boys to switch!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been happy with these until recently. Did the quality change? I had to buy a replacement because my first one fell apart. When I added the blades, they got stuck and the razor would not move, therefore not getting a clean shave. Now I have lots of cartridges and a broken razor.  Maybe I should return it. Bummed.</li>
    <li> Razors work great.  I get a nice shave every time.  You can;t beat the cost, shaving blades from the major manufacturers are ridiculously expensive.</li>
    <li> Plenty of people have been writing lengthy, comprehensive reviews of all the ins and outs of this brand of razor so I&#x27;ll settle for an anecdote:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 16 pack of blade is essentially a 8 month supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please buy them, so they can keep making them, so I can keep wearing them.</li>
    <li> Far better price than the competition and the quality is good.  Definitely worth trying.  So far, I&#x27;ve enjoyed the shave with no nicks, blades last.  Good value.</li>
    <li> Great value for replacement cartridges.</li>
    <li> Great blades, great price, fast shipping. I&#x27;m glad I quit throwing away so much money on brand name blades. These are just as good (maybe better) and a lot more affordable.</li>
    <li> Works great and well worth the price.  These razors work just as well as the brand name razors but, way better price...</li>
    <li> After paying the exorbitant amount of money for the Gillette Mach 3 blades for years I am pumped to have come across the Dorco razor &amp; blades. LOVE IT!  I shave my head and this razor glides across giving me a better shave than the Mach 3 did.  Feels great to be saving the money I am saving!</li>
    <li> The full functionality of a Mach 3 at a fraction of the price. What&#x27;s not to love? Maybe the name.</li>
    <li> These are a very good substitute for any of the &amp;#34;high dollar brands&amp;#34;. I have been using them since December and have found the blades usually last around 2 wks on average. I have heavier than average facial hair so that is impressive. I have given it a 4 star rating for the following 2 reasons. 1) The pivot on the blade is pretty stiff so you have to hold the handle closer and parallel  to your face so the blades stay in contact. I read a review from  from someone in 2013 saying the pivot was too loose. I don&#x27;t know if they adjusted it since then and now it is too tight or if I just got a faulty one. I did not contact the company since it wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal. If they want to send me another blade I will update this review with my findings. 2) I have found some blades aren&#x27;t as sharp as other blades out of the same package so I may have to change blades after only 5 - 7 days. However, since I am getting an average of 2 wks per blade, again I did not feel it important enough to contact the manufacturer. Overall, I definitely recommend these blades.</li>
    <li> Very good razor and blades. As good as name brands but it cost much less. Been using this for over 1 year now.</li>
    <li> excellent value.  fast ship.  works well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Mach 3 razors on my face and head. That was my razor of choice. I then got into wet shaving with a Double Edge safety razor (Feather blades) and my face is very happy...it&#x27;s also MUCH cheaper! Only problem, I can&#x27;t shave my head with a DE razor...I tried a couple times and looked like I got into a fight with a lawnmower and lost...badly!! Lol. I read really good reviews about these razors, they are the EXACT same razor that Dollar Shave Club uses...it&#x27;s just slightly cheaper to purchase directly and cut out the middle man (Dollar Shave Club) These Dorcos work good on my head when they are new, but not so much after a couple shaves. They do not seem to stay sharm as long vs the Mach 3. After just a couple head shaves, it irritates my skin. No visible razor burn, my head just kind of burns. In all fairness, I&#x27;m using the triple blades, I wanted to compare directly to my Mach 3, the Dorcos with more than 3 blades may work much better...I really dont know, haven&#x27;t tried them. In summary, these razors do work good for face, but not head. The best razors for my head still are the Mach 3&#x27;s and the Gillette Venus for women. Oh and by the way...the Venus blades DO fit on the Mach handle. One more thing...I did order some 4 blade razors from Harry&#x27;s to try out. I only used them twice so far, I just received the package the other day...so far, so good. I have very high hopes for this Harry&#x27;s, only time will tell :)</li>
    <li> Great deal for razors.  I can&#x27;t believe how much more the other guys charge. I have been using dorco shaving for three years now and love it.</li>
    <li> I was tired of paying so much for Gillette and was hopeful these would be ok.  Boy! Was I surprised!  Love the razor and the blades- better than the stuff in the store.</li>
    <li> These are great and last a long time</li>
    <li> The three-blade razors seem quite good, but of course not as good as the five-blade.</li>
