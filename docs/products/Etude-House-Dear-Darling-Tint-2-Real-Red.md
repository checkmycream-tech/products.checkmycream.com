      <li>Beautiful beautiful lip tint!</li>
      <li>However I think it&#x27;s just the thing about this Dear Darling Tint brand, but the taste isn&#x27;t very good.</li>
      <li>I really loved this!</li>

      <li>and it smells really nice, like a grape scent to it!</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s drying out my lips which is surprising because I forgot to put on a layer of lipbalm underneath.</li>
      <li>Color &amp;#34;Real Red&amp;#34; is absolutely gorgeous.  </li>

      <li>I love how easy this lip tint is to put on!</li>
      <li>The downside is your lips can get very dry and chapped so a nice balm before applying is best.</li>
      <li>Great classic look!</li>
      <li>Okay I needed to change my review after using this product a bit more.</li>
      <li>This is probably my favorite beauty product.</li>
      <li>love it :)</li>
      <li>the price I guess its ok</li>
      <li>Etude House&#x27;s product Real Red is WONDERFUL.</li>
      <li>I love the way it looks</li>
      <li>I LOVE THE TINT</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the color and quality</li>
      <li>and I am incredibly satisfied.</li>
      <li>Otherwise OK.</li>
      <li>(Though I like their lipsticks better.)</li>
      <li>Etudes stuff makes me want to buy it, unlike most makeup packaging...</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>The angled felt tip applicator is easy to use and allows a very precise application of the product.</li>
      <li>The best part is how long it stays.</li>
      <li>Wonderful product dries quickly and they gave me some extra&#x27;s  (samples) for other beauty tips, awesome huh?</li>
      <li>As a tip to anyone who decides to try this product, just make sure your lips are moisturized before applying, as it will exaggerate any uneven blemishes (and by no means does it imply your lips have to be in perfect condition for this product to look</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s extremely easy to blend out on the lips</li>
      <li>Quick shipping!</li>
      <li>The color is beautiful and it&#x27;s easy to apply, it does make my lips dry as I thought it would.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to enjoy the product , but honestly I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again for this reason</li>
      <li>The color was great, but the taste/smell is a bit medical...</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s extremely light</li>
      <li>Just wish this was available in stores</li>
      <li>The color is very nice and truly just a red.</li>
      <li>Also, the color dries very unevenly no matter how many times I try to correct or apply more.</li>
      <li>It is exactly what is described on their website, and it is so much more affordable than applying literally ANY of the products I have over and over again.</li>
      <li>I did like the bright red color of this lip tint</li>
      <li>and this is such a good product.</li>
      <li>but they were extremely professional and nice.</li>
      <li>Shipped and received quickly.</li>
      <li>The texture was light and watery, smells like cherries and the seller added a few samples which was very nice.</li>
      <li>Definitely gonna order more!</li>
      <li>I have tried Etude House&#x27;s Fresh Cherry Tint as well</li>
      <li>Thanks to this one, I really look forward to buying more lip tints from etude house.</li>
      <li>Overall, this lip tint gives off very natural cheek color and a perfect red tinge for a gradient look</li>
      <li>but the container is super cute, and yes, that totally matters to me.</li>
      <li>Happy with my purchase, doesn&#x27;t last all day and needs to be reapplied occasionally.</li>
      <li>and you can build up the color as much as you want!  </li>
      <li>The color was exactly how I wanted it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my first time trying lip tint</li>
      <li>It lasts pretty well and applies evenly.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the color (I ordered the real red lip tint)</li>
      <li>, exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>There aren&#x27;t enough affordable cosmetics that have cute packaging and aren&#x27;t purely for children.</li>
      <li>other than that, it&#x27;s a nice lip tint</li>
      <li>Very vibrant in color.</li>
      <li>The only cons about this is, is that the wearing power wasn&#x27;t that long, and the taste wasn&#x27;t good.</li>
      <li>Lovely stain on top of red lipstick, really does the trick to keep my lipstick looking smooth (not all cracked up after smiling a few times) with a deep pop of sultry color.</li>
      <li>anything~ Plus don&#x27;t apply too much or</li>
      <li>Really like this lip stain.  </li>
      <li>, this is so crazy awesome</li>
      <li>AT ALL TIMES hahaha.</li>
      <li>Thanks beautynetkorea</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such a nice shade of red!</li>
      <li>The color is more of a pinkish red but it is a pretty color and stayed during my entire theatre class without smudging.</li>
      <li>I ordered the true red color.</li>
      <li>It smells amazing and the color is pretty subtle.</li>
      <li>Tried this out the minute I saw it, that small hint of red looks wonderful and just enough to look natural...</li>
      <li>I love this, it smells like cherrys, but it tast odd till it sets, after it set</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this etude house dear darling tint.</li>
      <li>The color is lighter/brighter than red which i guess is expected because Korean tints mostly are.</li>
      <li>It has a nice scent to it and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>Be sure to apply lip balm because it can make your lips feel kinda tight, but not really dry or</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t last long and the color is a bit too light.</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;ve had it on for 2 hours</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it, it&#x27;s amazing</li>
    <li> Great color; love it.</li>
    <li> love it :) love this smell, so sweet :P</li>
    <li> My package came 2 weeks earlier than expected! I was so happy! I absolutely love the color (I ordered the real red lip tint) I like how it feels on my lips it&#x27;s extremely light and you can build up the color as much as you want!  Definitely gonna order more!</li>
    <li> You have to apply twice for the color to show up significantly, but the texture of the tint is a bit jelly, so it&#x27;s a bit awkward when you try to put it on. However, that&#x27;s not the reason why I&#x27;m giving it a bad review. I stopped wearing any make up for a while, to test the cosmetics I had, and when I put this one, my lips where irritated and dry afterwards. I have sensitive skin, so maybe that was the reason. Won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes and is a beautiful color. Isn&#x27;t super long-lasting (re-apply after 2 hours usually), but overall my go-to lip tint for now.</li>
    <li> The color of the lip tint definitely made me want to purchase it. It&#x27;s such a nice shade of red! The packaging came quicker than what Amazon had said it would be, as I found that the products I buy from Korea takes two weeks to come to CA instead of a month. I really wanted to enjoy the product , but honestly I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again for this reason: it felt really uncomfortable on my lips (a slight burning feeling). I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s just me though. Inexpensive for what you get, at least :)</li>
    <li> I did like the bright red color of this lip tint but I would rather purchase the delight lip tint of tonymoly than this. It doesn&#x27;t last long and the color is a bit too light.</li>
    <li> Really like this lip stain.  Color &amp;#34;Real Red&amp;#34; is absolutely gorgeous.  Just wish this was available in stores so I would not have to order it every time.</li>
    <li> Happy with my purchase, doesn&#x27;t last all day and needs to be reapplied occasionally.</li>
    <li> Etude House&#x27;s product Real Red is WONDERFUL. I absolutely love the color and quality, exactly what I was hoping for. There was a misunderstanding about the shipment of the product between the seller and I but they were extremely professional and nice. Very impressed with the seller and product. Will be ordering from them again.</li>
    <li> Pros: initial application&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Tastes horrible&lt;br /&gt;does not last long approx. 30mins (the other etude house hint lasts longer)&lt;br /&gt;sticky</li>
    <li> I like this color! However I think it&#x27;s just the thing about this Dear Darling Tint brand, but the taste isn&#x27;t very good. Try not to lick your lips until it&#x27;s completely dry with this on. I don&#x27;t know if I would want to kiss someone while wearing it because it does have a very poignant taste. I have tried Etude House&#x27;s Fresh Cherry Tint as well and I didn&#x27;t have this issue, but the range of colors are different. I would definitely recommend that line instead, though.</li>
    <li> Be sure to apply lip balm because it can make your lips feel kinda tight, but not really dry or anything~ Plus don&#x27;t apply too much or it&#x27;ll look like you were bleeding lol. Great seller and great product &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Lip tint for those of you out there who want that hint of red without screaming I am a vampire!  Tried this out the minute I saw it, that small hint of red looks wonderful and just enough to look natural...I also bought the vampire red tint for those darker tinted lips and I also adored that.  My daughter is excited about trying it out, she said it looked wonderful on me, so I guess we are going to share it for now.....from now on, lip tint it is!  Wonderful product dries quickly and they gave me some extra&#x27;s  (samples) for other beauty tips, awesome huh?</li>
    <li> Lovely stain on top of red lipstick, really does the trick to keep my lipstick looking smooth (not all cracked up after smiling a few times) with a deep pop of sultry color. A little goes a long way, trust me, you don&#x27;t want this stuff in your mouth&lt;br /&gt; (tastes REAL funny weird)</li>
    <li> The color was exactly how I wanted it. The texture was light and watery, smells like cherries and the seller added a few samples which was very nice. The only cons about this is, is that the wearing power wasn&#x27;t that long, and the taste wasn&#x27;t good. Other than that the price was reasonable and the seller was very generous with the samples.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE TINT IT LAST LONG AND WITH MY LIPSTICK.  I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ALL MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY..IT HAS A GREAT TASTE TOO...</li>
    <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s close to a gel consistency and has an artificial fruity smell (although that doesn&#x27;t bother me others beware of that!). The color is very nice and truly just a red. It&#x27;s extremely easy to blend out on the lips and I&#x27;ve even used it on the cheeks when I was in a pinch. Overall, this lip tint gives off very natural cheek color and a perfect red tinge for a gradient look and I am incredibly satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is probably my favorite beauty product. It feel like a jelly and leaves a sheer tint you can build on. Smells delicious also! Would recommend to EVERYONE</li>
    <li> The color was great, but the taste/smell is a bit medical... but the container is super cute, and yes, that totally matters to me. There aren&#x27;t enough affordable cosmetics that have cute packaging and aren&#x27;t purely for children. Etudes stuff makes me want to buy it, unlike most makeup packaging... it appeals to the eyes. But it wears well enough, too. (Though I like their lipsticks better.)</li>
    <li> This product had an unpleasant taste for me. Otherwise OK.</li>
    <li> This cheek tint is an awesome product! Will definitely be a repeAt customer. I look blooming when i used this.I highly recommend this etude house dear darling tint. 😊</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lip tint! I have been searching for an actual lip tint for a while now, after trying several lipsticks, lip glosses, lip &amp;#34;stain&amp;#34;, or lip tar (which is not cheap btw), this is so crazy awesome I plan on buying one in every color! It is exactly what is described on their website, and it is so much more affordable than applying literally ANY of the products I have over and over again. It quite seriously looks like I&#x27;ve just got done eating a cherry Popsicle AT ALL TIMES hahaha. As a tip to anyone who decides to try this product, just make sure your lips are moisturized before applying, as it will exaggerate any uneven blemishes (and by no means does it imply your lips have to be in perfect condition for this product to look good).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE MILLION STARS TO YOU, Etude House!</li>
    <li> This product takes about a month to be delivered because it&#x27;s coming from Korea(but I swear when I ordered it it said prime). The color is lighter/brighter than red which i guess is expected because Korean tints mostly are. Although its a stain it needs to be applied a couple of times especially after eating.&lt;br /&gt;For the price I guess its ok but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Beautiful beautiful lip tint! One of my favorites! Excellent staying power; it stays for hours, even after you eat.</li>
    <li> I love how easy this lip tint is to put on! Gives a nice &amp;#34;fruit punch&amp;#34; look to the lips. Good stain</li>
    <li> Sheer and buildable color payoff!</li>
    <li> Shipped and received quickly. I actually find this to be less natural looking than the vampire red, but it is a very pretty color. I like layering the two. It lasts pretty well and applies evenly.</li>
    <li> It came in time it was amazing thank you for the item</li>
    <li> I ordered the true red color. It arrived promptly. The color is more of a pinkish red but it is a pretty color and stayed during my entire theatre class without smudging. I reapply it about every three or four hours but, it doesn&#x27;t fade too bad. I would buy it again</li>
    <li> Love this product and the sellers!</li>
    <li> It definitely stays on well. I put some on my hand  and it didn&#x27;t come off when drenched in water. I even ate dinner and it still didn&#x27;t come off. It smells amazing and the color is pretty subtle.</li>
    <li> i got the vampire red color for the lip tint and it smells really nice, like a grape scent to it! the color&#x27;s nice, however you&#x27;d have to put in the lip tint more than once. i have to put it on every thirty minutes so that&#x27;s why i only gave it four stars, but other than that, it&#x27;s a nice lip tint</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase! It&#x27;s my first time trying lip tint and this is such a good product. I love the way it looks and it&#x27;s great quality. Thanks to this one, I really look forward to buying more lip tints from etude house. The color is beautiful and it&#x27;s easy to apply, it does make my lips dry as I thought it would. I&#x27;ve received lots of compliments for this. The best part is how long it stays. I really loved this!</li>
    <li> Nice color~ love it!!</li>
    <li> Edit: Okay I needed to change my review after using this product a bit more. Do not put a layer on lipbalm on first, because this tint needs to be applied onto dry skin in order to cling into it. I put some over lip balm and it just wouldn&#x27;t stay. Also, the color dries very unevenly no matter how many times I try to correct or apply more. Sometimes it leaves a lined rim on the outer edges of your lips unless you pat it with a tissue. Ughhh a little annoyed but whatever.  I got shade #2 real red and I love it! The angled felt tip applicator is easy to use and allows a very precise application of the product. The tint itself smells like grapefruit and feels like watery jelly. It becomes matte and doesn&#x27;t smudge. (However, it does wipe off when you&#x27;re eating.) So far, I&#x27;ve had it on for 2 hours and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s drying out my lips which is surprising because I forgot to put on a layer of lipbalm underneath. Great classic look! I love it.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping! The product is absolutely amazing and it smells very good like strawberries!</li>
    <li> Thanks beautynetkorea</li>
    <li> I got it about 3 days earlier than estimated date. Its gel like for those of you who don&#x27;t know. Its not tint water.</li>
    <li> I got the Etude House Dear Darling Tint #2 Real Red for my sister and she loves the color! It has a nice scent to it and a little goes a long way. The downside is your lips can get very dry and chapped so a nice balm before applying is best.</li>
    <li> I love this, it smells like cherrys, but it tast odd till it sets, after it set I did the kiss test on myself since I have no one to do the kiss test on, since I am a sad sad sad lonely person, the color is amazing and I will be buying more, much more, and other products from this company, I give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> It starts out sticky, then it dries onto your lips. Very vibrant in color.</li>
