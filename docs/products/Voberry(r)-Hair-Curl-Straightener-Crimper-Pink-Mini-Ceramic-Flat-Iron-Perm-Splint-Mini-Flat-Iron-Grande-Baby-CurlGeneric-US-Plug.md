<li> long.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve found that, if you&#x27;re not careful, this flat iron will tend to pull your hair somewhat but with very little practice, you can overcome that.</li>
<li> The heat plate is just over 2 1/4 inches long and 1/2&amp;#34; wide.</li>
<li> There&#x27;s a slight gap between the plates making those tiny stray pieces of hair a little harder to capture, but it can be done.</li>
<li> It was too small and too low of a heat.</li>
<li> so very small guess you get what you pay for :o(</li>
<li> When it arrived it was slightly defective.</li>

    <li> Very small compared to others but its great. Gets hot at 1 min and hottest temp at 5 min</li>
    <li> I like it seems to do the job for my daughters hair just don&#x27;t forget to use a heat protecter this flat iron gets super hot fast but it works great and is super cute and can fit and almost every purse for a quick touch up only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is cuz the plug in is super short</li>
    <li> Works great gets super hot !</li>
    <li> Perfect for my daughter hair,  she can even use it herself</li>
    <li> The entire device is about 6 inches long. The heat plate is just over 2 1/4 inches long and 1/2&amp;#34; wide. The cord is 48&amp;#34; long. It gets to usable temperature in about two minutes and max heat in around four minutes. It&#x27;s sufficiently hot enough for small touch-ups which is what I suspect is its purpose and works well in that respect. There&#x27;s a slight gap between the plates making those tiny stray pieces of hair a little harder to capture, but it can be done. I&#x27;ve found that, if you&#x27;re not careful, this flat iron will tend to pull your hair somewhat but with very little practice, you can overcome that. All in all, I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s great for touch-ups and definitely worth the money I paid for it. Ordered on Jan. 26th and received on Feb. 7th, before the estimated arrival date and it came in a manilla mailer envelope with the heating plate wrapped in bubble wrap. Arrived with no damage to the device.</li>
    <li> works great it just have a short cord</li>
    <li> Very very small but it gets extremely hot. It works great with crafts. Again it&#x27;s as small as my hand.</li>
    <li> so very small guess you get what you pay for :o(</li>
    <li> I would like a refund.</li>
    <li> Its pretty nice, I thought it would be sturdy and not so light weighted.</li>
    <li> Pros: it&#x27;s pink, compact good for traveling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I had it plugged in for about 10 minutes and it barley got hot.&lt;br /&gt;Used it and didn&#x27;t really do much to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have &amp;#34;on or off&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Small cord</li>
    <li> It works perfectly and super cute. Great value for so cheap. I would buy it again or for a gift.</li>
    <li> When it arrived it was slightly defective. It doesn&#x27;t clamp together evenly.</li>
    <li> I love the Voberry Hair straightener. Very durable. I bought it so I could do my daughters hair for her dance recitals and Pageants. I like the size as it makes it easy to travel with. It is smaller than I expected, however, perfect for my daughter. The pink is bright and the straightener gets hot fast and cools down pretty quickly. So far no complaints here.</li>
    <li> terrible is all i can say</li>
    <li> Takes way too long to heat up</li>
    <li> Too tiny to actually do anything. It&#x27;s awful. Save your money.</li>
    <li> This was perfect for my hair! I have sort of thin/wavy hair that fit nicely into this. It didn&#x27;t get overly hot and is small enough to store under the cabinet or in a drawer.</li>
    <li> I guess its my fault for not checking the measurement on this straightner......but its ridiculous!  I could not stop laughing when I opened it!!! Its SO small!!!! I just need it for my bangs, but still...come on! Lol I recommend this is you&#x27;ll be doing your barbies hair. I DO NOT RECOMMENDED FOR A GROWN PERSON, FULL SET OF HAIR!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet. It just got delivered. Takes a long time to arrive. Sooo tiny. Cheap made but looks to be what I expected.</li>
    <li> Works well so far, and perfect for travel :-)</li>
    <li> It was too small and too low of a heat. Can&#x27;t even get my bangs straight. Plus it took over a month to get it. I totally forgot that I ordered it.</li>
