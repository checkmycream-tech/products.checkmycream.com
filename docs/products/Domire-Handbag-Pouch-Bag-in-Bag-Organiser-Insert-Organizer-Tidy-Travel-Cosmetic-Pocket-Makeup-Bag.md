<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this. A lot bigger than shown!</li>
    <li> I love this case.  It&#x27;s the perfect size to travel with everything from your toothbrush to your face wash.  The one drawback is that it needs some structural support built-in so the bag doesn&#x27;t get crushed during use and travel.  I&#x27;ve kept the cardboard ring that it was shipped with to help maintain it&#x27;s shape.  Other than that, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> great product I would buy it again</li>
    <li> A great case. Very roomie. I keep my nail polish stuff in there and it&#x27;s perfect. Good buy!</li>
    <li> Exactly as listed.  Beautiful bag.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been eyeing this case for a while, and finally took the plunge to get it. And I love it! For years, I used a different travel bag which never seemed to have enough room. Something about its weird shape contributed for its low volume, I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;This case is a little flimsy and does not have structured walls. However, you can pack an entire mountain of products into it! Great capacity, and it&#x27;s super cute to boot.&lt;br /&gt;So in summary, the only con is its flimsy walls (which I prefer). Everything else is a++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 08/05/15&lt;br /&gt;I have used this for a while now and I still love it immensely! I haven&#x27;t had it fall apart, fade in color, or anything. It can fit crazy amounts of stuff- full huge bottles of product and a makeup collection. Don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without this!</li>
    <li> I got the same one pictured. It&#x27;s pretty and easy to clean. Fits my face wash, lotions and perfume plus a large filled cosmetic case. It easily collapses if not filled to fit in your luggage.</li>
    <li> This turned out to be perfect, exactly what I wanted. I wanted a train case so I could open and not have to dump everything like I usually do with a make up bag. This is perfect size to travel with. I can pack all my toiletries, sun screen, bug repellant, all my make up with room to spare. The picture made me think it was smaller, but I&#x27;m thrilled. It&#x27;s very cute too</li>
    <li> Love this!  It came just in time for an international trip.  Loved the pattern and it is well made.  Received compliments from my travel buddy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve searched for months for another case like this one after my previous one broke, but I was not going to pay big bucks for one. The price was right. When I travel for 7 to 14 days I&#x27;m carrying a lot of full sized products so this is perfect for my planned uses. This will be used specifically for my hair products- conditioner, shampoo bar, styler, hair accessories, oils, refresher spray, shower caps, spray bottle, etc.</li>
    <li> Loved it! The size I wanted and the material doesn&#x27;t seem cheap</li>
    <li> Bought this for Granddaughter for Christmas.  Very nice product.  Good quality, good price, good service.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a makeup case for my wife. I read all the reviews and saw there were issues with the colors. I was desperately hoping to get one with a purple design, and I did! The product itself is great. I&#x27;m only giving four stars for the time I spent worrying about which color would be sent.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my best friend at work&lt;br /&gt;She loves it and will use it on her vacation trips</li>
    <li> Love this bag. Bigger than expected.</li>
    <li> Very nice make-up bag, I&#x27;m sure my granddaughter will love it!</li>
    <li> Clean neat looking.Love mine.</li>
    <li> I love this collection,all of the bags are pretty ,durable and functional, I have a feeling they will last a long time.</li>
    <li> The product looks exactly like it does in the picture.  The case is made of good quality material.  I bought 5 of these for gifts, and they are all great cases.</li>
    <li> Purchased 2 for sisters and received embroidered train cases in purples and pinks, unlike picture which appears to be a water color type design in dark colors.  Its a cute and roomy bag, yet the exterior design is not what I expected to receive.</li>
    <li> Nice bag, good quality and great size.</li>
    <li> I will put a picture when I get a chance because this needs a better one. The inside has a protector fabric that is easy wash. On the top there is a removable makeup bag. Love the feel of the hemp! The size I would say is 8-10 inches long and about the same high.</li>
    <li> I needed a case for my makeup. I picked this one out because it was EcoTools branded (I was already sold on their makeup brushes) and the design was so pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In person, it&#x27;s just as pretty if not more so. It is soft sided, so I can shove it in a corner of my suitcase, but really well made. It should last for years. I like the fabric as well; it has a very eco-friendly feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: Built well, holds ample makeup and brushes, adorable, solid choice.</li>
    <li> Fits all my makeup plus more!</li>
    <li> This case is super cute and a great size.  It has a zippered compartment on the inside lid.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it would be nice if the outside has some sort of wax coating that would allow it to be wiped clean.  Unlike some other reviewers, I did receive the style/print that I ordered.</li>
    <li> Love this case. Bigger than i thought so when I got i I started ordering more makeup to fill it up! Great case for the money, sturdy and great for travel.</li>
    <li> I really like this case, it&#x27;s nice. However, I loved the pattern on this particular one, and that&#x27;s why I ordered it, though a differently patterned case came to me, without such a warning from the Seller. Made me feel weird, receiving a different item than what I had seen, been attracted to, and ordered. Case is nice though, but I had to return it because I&#x27;m at least half into how these cases look versus how they are manufactured. Quality was good, pattern was way off on what I received.</li>
    <li> This arrived in record time! But it was NOT the pretty silkscreen floral shown on not only this case, but ALL the pieces in this product line..........it was a muddy brown and purple \\&quot;scribbly\\&quot; flower thing with lavander trim....ugh. I now see that I wasn&#x27;t the only purchaser to have been disappointed.  Nothing in the site mentions that the design may vary...... but it certainly does. Be forewarned.</li>
    <li> I really liked this bag it is a good size but I was looking forba little bit bigger. Good product</li>
    <li> This make up case is perfect!  I didn&#x27;t have the issue that other buyers did, with it looking different. Mine was exactly as pictured!  I love it!</li>
    <li> I wanted something that I could put my makeup in and this is perfect for that! I love it! It&#x27;s a cute pattern and its very feminine. I like it a lot!! I definitely recommend it. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it :-)</li>
    <li> After reading the previous reviews I was aware of the possibility that I may get the \\&quot;red flower\\&quot; design (which is shown in the additional photos section) instead of the \\&quot;purple flower\\&quot; design...even though I was hoping for the purple. I ordered it anyway because I support what the brand is doing and the design isn&#x27;t terribly important to me. I did end up recieving the red flower design and, all in all, I like it. But this IS a MAJOR flaw that needs to be fixed. The case itself is sturdy and well made, and has a great extra compartment attached to the lid for holding brushes (or anything else that may be a little bit messier). Although the case is not \\&quot;stiff\\&quot;, I have had no issue with it collapsing on itself and my make-up only fills it half way.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for, love it!</li>
    <li> This item is very pretty and feminine and the perfect size to hold the cosmetic items I have.  Unfortunately, if you don&#x27;t pack it well, the walls collapse, especially if you zip open the top.  Even with that imperfection, I am quite happy with this purchase.  The price was right, it&#x27;s pretty and fairly functional.</li>
    <li> I bought this case to store my daughter&#x27;s play makeup in.  It really is nice and works great.  It is sturdy and very attractive.  I was a little skeptical about ordering after reading some of the other reviews but my train case looks exactly like the one  pictured.  It is very nice.  Would definitely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this I use it 24/7.I love how it&#x27;s invormenaly  freaindly!!!it stores tons and has a gorgous look and pretty flowers to top it!!!!if you need something to keep you makeup in this is it I&#x27;ve used it for years with no wear and tear!!this is what you need and for a great price!!!</li>
    <li> its okay not sturdy like i thought. inexpensive so for the price it works. big open pocket. inside pocket is nice</li>
    <li> This is a great case. It&#x27;s large and pretty and holds a lot of stuff.</li>
    <li> Loved these bags, they were so pretty and just the right size!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty and a good size but once you take out the packing you realize it&#x27;s not structured and flimsy.</li>
    <li> The train case was better than I expected. It has a matching color on the inside and has so much&lt;br /&gt;room for ALL my toiletries.. I gave one to my soon to be daughter-in-law and I bought the other&lt;br /&gt;for my daughter who is marrying next year so they can each have one. I will definitely buy more&lt;br /&gt;ecotools from Amazon in the future! Thanks for having it..</li>
    <li> This is a great case. I have purchased other EcoTools items and I am just so pleased to have this beautiful case. I bought it to keep my prescription and supplement bottles organized (I created a grid for the interior to keep the bottles in place) and I can get 15 small to medium prescription bottles in it.&lt;br /&gt;This would hold quite a bit of makeup, and maybe some not extremely tall hair products.&lt;br /&gt;In the lid is a clear zippered pouch that is supposedly removable. I didn&#x27;t realize that and have not tried to take it out. I will update this review if I find that it does not come out.&lt;br /&gt;I may buy another for my makeup and then I will have a matched set.&lt;br /&gt;As some other reviewers have stated, the sides are not particularly stiff, and I can see where the case may become worn and saggy. But I don&#x27;t think that will happen soon. Perhaps if I traveled alot and it got shifted and squished in a suitcase alot it would happen sooner. But I expect that it is durable enough to not fall apart for a long time. It and it&#x27;s inner plastic zip pouch seem to be made well.&lt;br /&gt;Some other reviewers stated that they received a different red design on their case, but I did not have this problem. In fact, when I looked up the red case it sells here on Amazon for almost $80, so if you get one count yourself lucky. :)</li>
    <li> Great and durable bag. Big and fits everything very neatly. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase. Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> Great case, fits all of my cosmetic needs.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of the hemp fabric and I think the soft silkscreen-like print on this tote is quite  attractive.  However, it&#x27;s not really suitable for carrying cosmetics as the sides are not reinforced at all and will sag and compress if the case is not stuffed full.  I ended up using this for socks and undies when packing rather than for cosmetics.  The top does have an integrated clear plastic cosmetic zip pouch that can hold three small prescription bottles or other small items, but the rest of the case is not lined with something rigid or waterproof.  I like the item, but just realize its limitations before you buy it.  I think it&#x27;s a bit overpriced for what it is; it&#x27;s really not very sturdy.</li>
    <li> This was just what I expected in every way.  Its sturdy and seems well made.  Looks just like the picture with the pink and purple roses.</li>
    <li> Beautiful case.  Great for travelling</li>
    <li> Very happy with this case.  Nice size which enables me to hold a lot of items.  I do like the idea that it collapses so when I travel with it, I do not have to worry about it fitting in my luggage.</li>
    <li> A sturdy and roomy small traveling case that holds its shape. Put makeup, medications, jewelry, tooth care products, and other small needs in this case and find them easily when you need them. It&#x27;s small enough to pack in a carry-on and large enough to be useful.</li>
    <li> Very nice bag, great size too. Quality product. My mom will love it for her bday!!(filled with goodies!!)&lt;br /&gt;Definitely buy. It&#x27;s even better in real life!</li>
    <li> This is pretty and a nice size.  I was only disappointed that the main case area is a bit flimsy.  The case is top heavy  I&#x27;m sure it will help to have it filled up but it would have been nice to have a little more sturdiness.</li>
    <li> This was exactly as advertised.  Beautiful design and well made.  I would recommend this product and it is versatile and can be used for other things.</li>
    <li> overall, i like the product. I am glad i received the cream / purple version because thats what i wanted. This Is a soft case, no hard structure. I must say the pretty mid lavender color inside would be nice on the outside instead of the cream. This case is nice for travel for a few items. I ended up having to order a bigger more structured case for the bathroom to fit more items though.</li>
    <li> It is very cute and it is sturdy. Great quality for the price. Much cheaper than target! It is a little flimsy when opened, but it is great.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted. It holds a lot of makeup. It is somewhat collapses so it can fit in tight spots if you don&#x27;t fill it all the way up. There is a plastic small case inside that snaps to the top cover that you could put your toothpaste/jewelry inside. I am very satisfied with the product and it is worth the price.</li>
    <li> I love the size of this makeup bag. It holds all of my things with a bit of room to spare and it&#x27;s easy to keep clean.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice, large bag that holds my makeup wonderfully! As another reviewer posted, the sides aren&#x27;t reinforced, so they can sag, but I don&#x27;t care about that; I just need something to hold all my makeup and this bag does just that. It&#x27;s cute too!</li>
    <li> It looks exactly as pictured.  Very good quality and I like the simple little details.  It does what it should, carry my make-up :-)</li>
    <li> Great size, material is nice, coloring is cute as is the design. The inside is a pretty lavender color. I love this so much!</li>
    <li> It this bag stayed upright just how it is pictured it would be perfect. It does not, unfortunately. I set it in my lap and though it only has a couple of items in it (nowhere near capacity) the items will fall out because the walls collapse! Do not buy this bag if you expect it to hold anything. Very frustrating.</li>
    <li> Cute bag, great size..a little flimsy, but I can make it work.</li>
    <li> Perfect size train case, but it&#x27;s collapsible. One problem is that it&#x27;s not sturdy, the sides aren&#x27;t backed at all so it collapses. Kind of a pain when you&#x27;re not necessarily going to fill it to the brim. Its a design flaw.</li>
    <li> Large enough for what I need! I love the fabric. Handy zipper compartment for make-up brushes or whatever. Seems sturdy.</li>
    <li> In love with this bag. It&#x27;s practical and chic</li>
    <li> Beautiful cosmetic bag, except for staining on the bottom that I cannot seem to remove. Other than that, service was great.</li>
    <li> Even though this is made for other purposes, this is perfect as a coupon holder with index cards as dividers.  It holds all my coupons in one place as opposed to using hard card boxes (that pop open and have no handle).</li>
    <li> My girls liked their makeup up cases. Purple is their favorite color, and they will use these cases everyday. Really nice cases.</li>
    <li> My wife really likes this. It holds all her makeup. She does wish it had a mirror.  Price was right on it too.</li>
    <li> I got this as a Christmas gift for my daughter for her manicure tools.  Love it!  Very pretty, nice quality, perfect size.</li>
    <li> This thing is huge. I thought I could use it as an everyday makeup bag, I was so wrong.  But for seven bucks, it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> very spacious and gorgeous! worth every penny! SUPER FAST SHIPPING! I LOVE this bag! my girlfriends are all asking where I got it!</li>
    <li> Very cute case! I was hesitant that it would not be big enough, but it is the perfect size for all my makeup. I love that it is spacey, but still able to be portable when travelling. It shipped very quickly; I received it 2 days after I bought it! It is a canvas type material, but it is not flimsy- it can stand up on its own without anything in it. In the pictures I attached, you can see that I can easily fit my large bottle of lotion in this case. Also, there is plenty of space for your Naked palette, with tons of room to spare.</li>
    <li> This beautiful makeup bag is rendered completely useless because the zipper does not work. The bag is organic, which I love, has a beautiful dyed-in-the fabric floral motif, and is a nice size. But the fabric is so soft that it won&#x27;t keep its shape and the zipper catches on itself, jams, and breaks open when you somehow manage to get it zipped up. So, so, so sad.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my twin sis.  She keeps it on the table next to her and she keeps her makeup, nail polish, etc.  all in one place.  Now I want one.</li>
    <li> its good but it wasn&#x27;t the same colour in the photo (which I like it more), and i&#x27;ll not return it because i brought to someone and she liked it.</li>
    <li> I got a different color, but that&#x27;s okay.  This is a great bag.  I actually want a second one.  I use it to hold all my rubberbands and my comb and it fills it up, and it works perfectly.  Recommend this bag to everyone.  Happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I bought this case 2 months ago, it is amazing and fit all my stuff. I was worried about the material, but when I received it I was very impressed!! It is a very good quality with cheap price!</li>
    <li> This is by fair the most convenient travel case I&#x27;ve ever had. It&#x27;s fits all of my stuff in there including toiletries, make up, and even eye shadow pallets. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Pretty bag - however no structure to it so it&#x27;s not great for packing in your luggage.</li>
    <li> I was happy with the look of the case and it&#x27;s also very well made.  I bought it a few months ago and so far, it has held up well.</li>
    <li> Love this bag!  Made of recycled materials it&#x27;s very well made and carries all my make up needs.  A great bag!</li>
    <li> Lovely natural colors and quite sturdy. I use it to store my nail polish but can be used for a multitude of things.&lt;br /&gt;i store my files and nail cutters in the top zipper compartment and it keeps things quite organized. it holds a good 30 bottles of Essie nail polish so i love it.</li>
    <li> Well made and it holds a lot it perfect for what I want it for.</li>
    <li> Very good quality love the colors</li>
    <li> It is a great size and I love the way it looks. It works perfectly for me! I am happy with choice.</li>
    <li> I needed a new cosmetic bag for travel and this one caught my eye. I thought the design was appeasing and the bag was big enough to fit what I needed. This bag was worth the money, I have had it for about a month now and it has done what I needed it to do.</li>
    <li> The case is just ok.  I thought it would be sturdier, but it is flimsly.  The zipper isn&#x27;t very sturdy either.  Not worth the price. There was no clear zip case inside, either.  I would have contact the seller, but there was nowhere for me to do that.</li>
    <li> Just got my bag, and I was fortunate enough to receive the purple one (it is adorable). I love the bag, I actually use it for my perm rods, clips, etc for my hair and it&#x27;s able to hold everything with no issue and I still have room. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I love ecotools products. This case is very nice and the top of it comes with a detachable bag. It organizes my makeup very nicely and I can also fit my nude tude palette in here. I&#x27;d recommend having smaller makeup bags in order to organize the contents more efficiently though.</li>
    <li> It is a very poorly made case with a tiny plastic bag, not at all what I was expecting and immediately returned.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful case. I bought one for my sister for Christmas and just had to get one for myself, too. Both showed up in the purple, which is the color I wanted. They material feels very &amp;#34;eco.&amp;#34; The colors are lovely. There is PLENTY of room for my make-up and also my deodorant, toothbrush, brush, etc. if I go away for a weekend. I don&#x27;t mind that it isn&#x27;t stiff and &amp;#34;collapses&amp;#34; because it makes it easier to put it in my overnight bag. I would get this bag again and will buy others for gifts in the future.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter opened it at Christmas and she was very happy with this item. I will remember these items for future gifting.</li>
    <li> This arrived in a timely manner.  It&#x27;s larger than I expected but will be ideal for traveling.  I&#x27;m excited to use this for my trip to Europe next month.</li>
    <li> I bought this bag to hold medications when going on vacations. It’s a neat way to conceal some personal items like medicine, make-up, and hygiene items. The bag is well-made, and sturdy. I’ve had it for about 2 years, and have taken it along with me on many trips. It serves its purpose well, concealing personal items in style.    The carrying handle is convenient and the zipper is still fully functional. There have been no rips, breaks or tears.   Unfortunately, I was very displeased with the look of the bag that I received. The design on the bag I received looks nothing like the design on the picture listed here. The product description does say that color may vary, however, it did not say design may vary.   That is the main reason I am giving it 3 stars. The design on the bag I received is quite ugly, to be frank. It&#x27;s basically a giant red blob, which I guess is supposed to be a flower? But there is no petal detail like the one shown in the picture. There is only one &amp;#34;flower&amp;#34;, and then a few other random small blobs. Frankly, it looks like a child drew it.   I still use the bag on vacations because it serves its purpose but it doesn’t look as cute as I wanted it to. Because of that I would only recommend the product to a friend with caution that they may or may not get a bag with a decent design on it.

    <li> I really didn&#x27;t think I would love this as much as I ended up doing!  The top inside zipper pocket was absolutely perfect for brushes and mascara!  Even after a long trip, it kept its shape.  Very impressive!</li>
    <li> It is a very pretty and functional bag, only a little to big - but otherwise a great item.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Cute but super flimsy</li>
    <li> Beautiful Cosmetic case, I use it for nail polish and I can hold about 60-70 bottles, not neatly but they all fit snug as a rug in there. Really nice bag for the price, I would 100% recommend.</li>
    <li> This make up case said colors vary so it did not come with the roses but the bird on it is ok.  Also I thought it contained a plastic case inside for brushes but mine came empty. A little disappointing.  Otherwise the size is perfect for what I need.</li>
    <li> I love the fact my order arrived before expected  delivery. I love the material this case is made out of and i love the style of the bag. it&#x27;s very roomy inside and even has a clear zipper pouch inside to store more cosmetics. this was a good buy.</li>
    <li> Very visually appealing!  I like the look and feel of the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not use this bag for makeup or anything heavy, however.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t appear to be very supportive and seems fragile (although I am sure it is not).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I had intended to use this as a makeup bag - I now plan to use this to store hair bands, scarves, etc (light weight items)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very lovely bag, no regrets on it&#x27;s purchase.</li>
    <li> This bag is much larger than I had been expecting (in a good way). It seems to be quite sturdy and is very pretty. Great deal as well!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful case! It holds my Naked 3 palette and all of my Urban Decay goodies. I do wish the sides of the case were sturdier. Since it is a soft fabric, it collapses and doesn&#x27;t hold its shape. It really is pretty and nicely made though!</li>
    <li> Perfect for just a little bit of makeup. Pretty colors!</li>
    <li> I truly think this bag prevents messes. I barely have to clean the inside for powders and such.  It&#x27;s the perfect size to fit in my carry-on, and the stitched design is too cute!</li>
    <li> This case is a nice size. It is a nice purple color and the bag is great quality. Love it.</li>
    <li> I just recieved it and i love it.  It is the perfect size for the spot on my bathroom sink.  I could not have asked for anthing better.  Some reviewers stated that the bag would collapse,  but i just used the flexable cardboard liner that came with the bag and trimmed it down.  I don&#x27;t have alot of cosmetics but they should all fit nicely.  I will have to put something on the bottom of bag to protect it.  It&#x27;s Perfect!  I would very highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> A very pretty case at a great price. Holds a lot. It can be flimsy if you don&#x27;t have much in it, but not a big deal.</li>
    <li> Love this case!  I use it for my daughters inhaler which for a child is an inhaler and attachment and I can put her glasses and a small brace it it!  It is great size and flexible not stiff!  cute as well!</li>
    <li> Good quality. Much bigger than I thought it would be. It definitely made a great gift. I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> This was a well made train case.  The quality was very good and it was pretty.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Love it! very sturdy and easy to clean. I can&#x27;t fit a regular can of mousse nor a flat iron but it holds all my little travel items that get lost during travel.</li>
    <li> Has two zippers, and was sent to me with one of them broken. It&#x27;s such a hassle to send back, I didn&#x27;t bother, since the other zipper does work, but still disappointing. Holds all my makeup, though.</li>
    <li> This is such a gorgeous bag and holds so much....I am so happy with my purchase....you won&#x27;t go wrong if considering purchasing this case</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great thing to use for make-up or even a small wig holder.I needed it for when I went to the hospital for a heart surgery.Thanks again</li>
    <li> This is a great train case. It fits a lot of stuff.  I have 6 eye shadow pallets, my mascara, powder brush and I alos like the zipper pocket which allows me to also store some of my brushes.  Love it and I am very impressed with this as well as the pencil case!!  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my stepmom and she likes it. It&#x27;s a lot bigger than I expected it to be but the material is nice and it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This is an AMAZING product</li>
    <li> It a good sized case, lovely color and environmental friendly.&lt;br /&gt;It has a zipped pocket inside which is handy if you want to segregate something.&lt;br /&gt;Love this purchase!</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift for my daughter to use for her medications.  She says it works very well for her.  She would like it even more if the inside top had a mesh pocket instead of the plastic one.</li>
    <li> Easy to clean and great for packing everyday makeup or using to hold bathroom necessities when going on vacation. True to picture!</li>
    <li> Love having a separate zippered pouch built into the case - plus the ability to remove the brush pouch is very convenient.</li>
    <li> This is a well made cosmetic case.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s not stiff so I will be able to pack it easily when traveling.  Also the zip closure in the lid works well for brushes.  I would have given it 5 stars but would have preferred to have elastic holders in the lid instead of an enclosure so individual brushes would be easier to get to</li>
    <li> This case is super cute and very big. It is a great size for holding all your makeup. I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Bigger then expected the sides and bottom have no reinforcement. I put a Tupperware of the same size in helps keep things standing.</li>
    <li> So thrilled I received the one in the pic (purple flowers), because it matches the brush cup I received as a gift. Now, my vanity is beautifully organized!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this makeup bag. All my makeup tools are eco-tools so i was excited to get this bag. I&#x27;ve had a eco tools makeup bag before but it was getting old so i decided to get a new one. Its an amazing price and you cant find it in stores, well atleast i couldnt. I love it, it is just so cute and no problems at all. I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and its adorable and i love it. its worth the money, for holding all your ecotools makeup! hope this helps:)</li>
    <li> Nice size and cute but would be great if it had more structure.</li>
    <li> Great quality, very large, beautiful colors and construction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so much better than the darn paper bag I was using.</li>
    <li> This is a very cute, basic train case for makeup storage. It is less sturdy than it might be but it is stylish and looks like it will hold up well. it does not have reinforced walls but this can be an advantage if you are looking for a travel case that can squish into a larger bag or suitcase. All in all, I think it will suit my purposes well. It is not the right choice for people who need a case that can take major battering; you may want to look for a plastic or metal case instead if you want something that can be stacked, or something that will protect fragile products like eyeshadows. I will be scotch guarding to make cleanup easier.</li>
    <li> I love this train case. It fits my naked 1 &amp; 2 pallettes perfectly, along with my moisturizer, brush case, bronzer and blush, but the main selling point for me was that I can STAND UP my mascara and other products that I would prefer to not have lying down. Perfect size.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s larger then expected</li>
    <li> I love ecotools and this was the first product I bought from them. It is a great bathroom bag, usually i keep all of my makeup in it, but I also use it as my toiletry travel bag when we go on vacations.</li>
    <li> This makeup case is a great size.</li>
    <li> Just as described in product description.</li>
    <li> I love this case. It holds all my makeup together and helps keep me organized. The case is well made, and does what it is supposed to do well. In addition to being environmentally good, it&#x27;s pretty.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this makeup bag! It&#x27;s beautiful and exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I received this case and it&#x27;s exactly as the picture! It does collapse a little, but that&#x27;s only without anything inside. Will be using it on my very first Disney World trip!</li>
    <li> LARGE BUT THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE FIRM SIDES</li>
    <li> J&#x27;ai apprécié de recevoir le vanity avec la rose rouge et verte. Hormis le fait qu&#x27;il soit beau et solide, il est trés pratique avec sa trousse transparente et d&#x27;une bonne grandeur.</li>
    <li> Great size. Exactly what I needed to keep my make up. Love it.</li>
    <li> Very nice! I like it a lot. It is a perfect size and has a clear zippered compartment on the top for the brushes or whatever you want. It is very well made.</li>
    <li> Love it. Just the right size.</li>
    <li> Nice size!  Perfect size actually.  The design is super cute.  I love the zipper pouch on the lid inside.  Perfect for my brushes.  This bag holds a lot of makeup.  I LOVE this bag and highly recommend it if you are on the fence.  It&#x27;s perfect for someone with a lot of makeup.  It is very easy to clean too!</li>
    <li> didnt like the product</li>
    <li> I wanted a bag to keep a portable BP in and this one fit everything perfectly!  It&#x27;s also very pretty and looked just like the picture.</li>
    <li> Very classy and well made.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a great cosmetic case.  Holds alot and my sister absolutes loves it. Also glad that it is a eco friendly product</li>
    <li> This bag isn&#x27;t bad. It&#x27;s very pretty and fairly big. The downside is the sides are really flimsy and the bag just smushes down. My mom liked it but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
    <li> Beautiful, and a very nice gift for a low price  All my stuff fits great and no problems. Love this and at a very good price</li>
    <li> Gave these as gifts for teenagers. They loved them. Very nice. Bigger than i expected. The material is gauze/burlap type/texture. High quality.</li>
    <li> I really, really like this case! It seems well made, and I like the see through separate compartment in the top. I&#x27;m really excited that it has ZERO chemical smell, every other case I&#x27;ve bought has had the chemical smell that never comes out. Another thing I like, is it&#x27;s very roomy....not too big or too small, but just right. The color is just as advertised and even nicer looking in person. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> These are just what I wanted. I got one for me and one for my mom. One can store anything in them. I wanted these in particular because they have 2 ZIPPERS!!! With 2 zippers, I can lock this bag. So many just have the one zipper that goes all the way around. This has two that can meet in the middle or go to either side. Also, this bag is extremely well made. I love Alicia Silverstone and her views on ecologically considerate materials. I will certainly give her other products a try now that I see how well she did on these train cases. These cases will last a long time. They are very tough and very feminine at the same time, much like myself. Ha! I would recommend this train case to anyone.</li>
    <li> I really like this bag. It does collapse when you push it down so perfect for traveling and pops right back up when placed back in the bathroom. would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup bag, but wish it had more structure. It collapses which makes it difficult to dig around for items.</li>
    <li> This train case is big enough for make-up, brushes and I even store my jewelry in it too on trips. Good quality as usual for Alicia&#x27;s products...I would recommend to buy if you need an eco-friendly makeup bag. Price is good.</li>
    <li> I bought a series of these and they&#x27;ve been great. They come in every size and shape and for different uses and I have them all filled up and ready in my suitcase. I don&#x27;t even have to think about what I need to pack and just add my clothes on top and I&#x27;m ready to go. Love the pattern, the feel, and shapes of the series.</li>
    <li> Much bigger than I anticipated. I ended up sorting my products in ziplock baggies inside, had plenty of room to spare and I have a *lot* of eyeshadow alone :P</li>
    <li> Cute, good price, nice size, perfect for what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This was exactly the train I wanted, and I was lucky enough to receive the beautiful purple design. It&#x27;s a lot prettier and it looks more durable than the more cheaply made plastic trains you can buy at Target for $20+ since it&#x27;s made of a really nice woven material.  On the inside it has a nice separate part to put your brushes or more delicate makeup.  You can put a lot of makeup in this bag, so overall I am really happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t really looking for much: a place to consolidate all the girly things that I was constantly hunting for under the sink, preferably light and made of sustainable materials. This is exactly that, it&#x27;s pretty enough to leave on the counter when I&#x27;m too lazy to put it away, and didn&#x27;t cost a fortune. Recommend.</li>
    <li> Nice,  holds a lot of makeup and essentials...</li>
    <li> a little too flimsy or my liking. overall its alright.</li>
    <li> Lovely color and well constructed!</li>
    <li> Having purchased several EcoTools products at my local drugstore - as well as the Alicia Silverstone Hanging Valet off of Amazon - I decided to create a complete set of EcoTools cosmetic bags: the pattern is absolutely GORGEOUS, and I&#x27;ll need cosmetic bags of various size when I move into my college dorm this fall (although they&#x27;re ideal for vacations, business trips, etc.). I was a bit skeptical after reading the reviews for this train case, but I decided to place my order anyway - I would have sent it back and reordered it until I got the \\&quot;newer\\&quot; (beige/lavender flowers) bag rather than the \\&quot;older\\&quot; (red watercolor-esque flower) bag. I got exactly what I wanted, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS!!!!! It isn&#x27;t super, super sturdy, but I use it for my loose makeup and it works wonderfully. Absolutely amazing.</li>
    <li> Super&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product. It&#x27;s very spacious , everything fits. Good gift idea. This is my favorite makeup case.</li>
    <li> fashionable and well made. was proud to give it as a Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d have to return it bc I was afraid it&#x27;d be too small or the wrong color...but when it arrived I hurriedly opened the package and to my delight the color was perfect. It matched my other ecotools accessories. And it was large enough to fit all my travel goods.</li>
    <li> Love this case. I put my make up in it and also put some of my brush. It is very nice i love the colors and also can contain a lot of things. Will recommend</li>
    <li> Perfect size to hold cosmetics and other sundries for a short trip or hospital stay.  I wanted a small-ish bag with a double zipper that I could use a travel lock on and secure my Kindle Fire.  This fit the bill perfectly.  My only disappointment was with the soft sides of the case, I would have preferred a firmer side. Surprisingly there was a coupon in the package for $1.00 off a similar product, but it expired in 2011!  The apparent age of this product did not detract from its appearance or functionality though.</li>
    <li> (the one pictured) which I was worried about given that it states they vary. As a few others have stated I do wish the sides has a little more structure to them. But its a great size and love that there is a zipper pocket for smaller items.</li>
    <li> My wife yelled at me when she noticed I&#x27;d thrown away her favorite makeup bag ... she was very pleased with my replacement choice ... thanks for bailing me out! Well made, attractive, and environmentally responsible.</li>
    <li> Love it. Love it. Love. I bought this product for someone else, but with I had gotten one for myself.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of ecotools products (brushes and various makeup/travel cases) and I am very happy with all of them. When I saw this I knew I HAD to have it. I LOVE the design and I don&#x27;t have any other ecotools products with this design. My other ones have red flowers. Purple is my favorite color. Specifically greyish purple and mauve-magenta purple. Both colors are in this case :) The size is great, I love the pocket on the inside top. The fact that it is collapsible is great cause it&#x27;s easy to fit into a larger bag for travel. And for a little over eight bucks, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this!</li>
    <li> It is perfect for the birthday gift I plan  to give a friend on 29th. She will love it. Thank you</li>
    <li> I love this case. All my makeup fits neatly. It&#x27;s great that I can have everything all in one place and take it with me. It&#x27;s very spacious and the case itself is very well constructed. Beautiful materials.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom for Christmas and now I want one for myself! It&#x27;s so pretty and very spacious. It fits all of her makeup and makeup brushes with room to spare. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Adorable.  Very good deal for the money. Good construction. Strong fabric. Attractive colors and design.</li>
    <li> Very spacious. It&#x27;s not super firm but it still stands up nicely. I can also fit a lot of brushes in the zip pocket.</li>
    <li> Bigger than expected, which was a bonus! It&#x27;s so pretty too. Everything I need fits inside. It&#x27;s not the most sturdy, but I put a piece of cardboard on the bottom and that helps. The clear plastic sleeve for makeup brushes is roomy as well and will fit your standard length brushes. No complaints!</li>
    <li> I received the item in the same color as the picture. I love this case, as I can fit whatever I need of my most commonly used makeup in there. Other people have complained that it&#x27;s flimsy, and while it doesn&#x27;t have stiff sides I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s an issue at all. It&#x27;s easy to find my cosmetics in here, despite a lack of organization, and I can fit several brushes in the top pouch (two of them being very full foundation brushes.)</li>
    <li> Product arrived much quicker than expected (thank you!). Received the correct color I was hoping for (Beige/Sage/Lavender). It&#x27;s a beautiful case and much nicer than anything I&#x27;ve seen in stores. Very spacious interior and sturdy shape - it can collapse down if you need to pack it, but if this is a concern, I recommend you keep the cardboard inserts to help with sides. I also purchased the Ecotools Alicia Deluxe Pencil Case in Beige/Sage which coordinates perfectly with the train case. I store my pencil case inside the train case (it fits perfectly) - which also helps the train case keep its shape. There is plenty of room to store eye-shadow, hair clip, etc. and ample room in the zippered train case lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend.</li>
    <li> Cute case and it holds a lot I love it! I love that it has a spot to put all your make up brushes!</li>
    <li> Love these case.  I have bought 3 of these so far.  They have great room in them and an inside zippered area too.  The one I have the inside compartment stays in it.  The other 2 have removal inside compartments.  Which is fine I love them both.</li>
    <li> This case is much bigger than I anticipated, which was a good thing. I only gave it four stars because, like others have commented, the sides are not reinforced so that the case collapses. But It&#x27;s all a matter of one&#x27;s taste. It is a very nice bag otherwise and can&#x27;t be beat for the price! I recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got most of the EcoTools brushes, and this train case just seemed the best one to continue the pattern with.  It&#x27;s very roomy and will accommodate all of my brush/makeup tools.  The only thing I would change would be to build in something to stiffen the walls of the case.  There&#x27;s currently no support in the side walls, unless you keep the cardboard that was shipped inside the case to support those walls.</li>
    <li> Since I sent this directly to a friend I can only go off of her word but she said its a good sized bag that is &amp;#34;very cute in person&amp;#34; and looked like it was made well/very sturdy.</li>
    <li> This train case is cute and functional.  I love it.  I use it to store all my make up and beauty products.  Recently, when I went on a trip, I added all of my toiletries to it, everything but my blowdryer fits in it.  But, it doesn&#x27;t look huge.  If anything happens to mine, I will repurchase this.</li>
    <li> Great product to hold my makeup and skincare and confidiently fits in my gym bag.</li>
    <li> Much bigger than I expected - but holds allof my makeup, brushes, tweezers &amp; tools, and even more!</li>
    <li> Great size, it&#x27;s big enough to fit all of my wife&#x27;s necessities. Well made and beautiful style. My wife was pleased with it.</li>
    <li> the base of this bag is too big for the little bit of make-up I have and the pouch is too small for my brushes...this is not going to work for me. disappointed by far.</li>
    <li> This bag is a gorgeous bag that I use for some personal belongings of mine. It&#x27;s very spacious and what I love about it is that it&#x27;s all natural. An all-natural makeup bag for around $15? That&#x27;s a good deal right there</li>
    <li> This bag is a great size. I have been looking for something bigger but not too big since my makeup collection has grown, so this was perfect. I love that it is made out of everything ecofriendly. That is really important to me. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> Love this case. Great price too.</li>
    <li> Very well made. Beautiful looks just like the picture. Best Christmas gift I have received in years. Worth the price!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased an Ecotools Alicia Train Case.  I used it for my personal items while in the hospital.  It is big enough to hold all of my essentials and small enough to fit into a small suitcase.  I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Cute but just thin burlap like material...worried will not last long.  Sort of flimsy is only way to describe it for price.</li>
    <li> Great case. Met my expectations. Fast delivery. Good price.</li>
    <li> This case came to me right on time and it looks exactly as it it shown.  My wife really likes it.</li>
    <li> You will be amazed all that you can fit into this bag. I was amazed, and loved the top zippered space for my brushes. Would happily buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase,I was a little hesitant buying this case for the simple fact that it&#x27;s a little expensive.But i was pleased with it arrived and i opened the package.It&#x27;s really nice,great quality.</li>
    <li> Flimsy sides and bigger than I needed for travel.</li>
    <li> Very soft prettiness. More room than it looks to carry all your toiletries. Zipper top keeps small things from getting lost and keeps them convenient to get to .</li>
    <li> I now use this makeup bag every day. I love the size of it; it&#x27;s perfect for holding all of my essentials plus some less used makeup items</li>
    <li> PERFECT! I love this! The size it wonderful!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute and the material&#x27;s tough so it lasts really well for travel :) I&#x27;ve used this every day over the past year.&lt;br /&gt;Some people might want to know that the inside isn&#x27;t supported, so when it&#x27;s empty, it makes like an accordion and floops down into a pancake. It&#x27;s convenient for my needs though. When I have it empty, I prefer tucking it away so it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space.</li>
    <li> Very cute makeup bag held all my stuff and is very chic no like my old bag</li>
    <li> I had considered a makeup case for years. Finally, I was moving cross-country and I needed something to keep my makeup together and organized, and this was it. I bought this mainly because it was small, the price was right, and it had Prime shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to find that it was much larger than described. I don&#x27;t actually have a whole lot of makeup; three powder compacts, mascara, a few eye shadows, primer, a tube of blush, and an eyebrow makeup compact. It held all of that with room to spare, so I was able to put most of my skin care products (creams, serums, etc) in here as well. I put brushes and applicators in the pocket under the lid. If you are someone who has a lot of makeup and many small compacts for eye shadow and such, you may not like this because it&#x27;s a soft case with no dividers. It would be great for holding palettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is NOT a hard case, but that&#x27;s fine with me. It&#x27;s very handy, and although my move is long past I still use it to store and organize my makeup, because its convenient to have it all together and I can just grab it and go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case included a coupon for $1.00 off an Ecotools purchase, but the coupon was already a few years expired, which was a bummer. But I am very pleased with the case overall.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this purchase, very roomy, holds a lot, recycled material which I love, would purchase again.</li>
    <li> So CUTE! I bought this as my travel make up bag. It has lots of room and hold everything I need.</li>
    <li> I was delighted to have received &amp;#34;exactly&amp;#34; what I ordered!  Previous reviews had stated that they got a different design on their case, however, I received just what was advertised!  I would have preferred one w/solid sides, however, this one will work fine!</li>
    <li> Very nice product and arrived in good time for holidays. Picture does not show that flowers on front are raised embroidery. Great gift for young women.</li>
    <li> As other reviews, bag is a little floppy and doesn&#x27;t hold shape. I&#x27;m a perfectionist in some areas so it bothered me. I&#x27;ll use it for trips though to throw lots of things in. It&#x27;s pretty and natural looking.</li>
    <li> Love this case.  At first I thought it might be too, but after two weeks it is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;I can keep my makeup, full size brush and a few other odds and ends all together for travel or just on my dresser to stay organized and there is still room&lt;br /&gt;so happy I made the purchase.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this, especially the material. Its sturdy enough to not collapse yet still be flexible. Super lightweight , compact, vintage style and hand washable. Measurement approx 9x5x5 so I dont think it suit for large stuffs. I use it to store facial masks and some basic make ups and it works just fine :&#x27;)</li>
    <li> Enjoying my new making bag.</li>
    <li> This is cute. It will easily fit in any suitcase.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Ecotools! I had seen this bag in stores &amp; wanted to purchase it but it wasn&#x27;t in the budget at the time.  When I went back they were all gone.  I was so happy that I found it on Amazon. When it was delivered, it was much bigger than I remember it being in the store (which was ok by me).  Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Great color and the perfect size. I don&#x27;t have  a lot of makeup, but what I do have fits in this case wonderfully. It has a little clear zipper pocket behind the lid that I use for my brushes. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This case is really adorable. The material seems to be pretty good quality. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and the zippers still work like new. It&#x27;s bigger than I expected it to be, but it&#x27;s not a problem because I can squish it down to fit in my purse no problem. Overall, I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This one is life saver for me. I bought 2 of them, 1 I stored my make up items int and the other my bath items and I&#x27;m really very happy that I bought it.</li>
