      <li>I went to great lengths to be sure this was certified as another</li>

      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think they have now addressed the ill-fitting dropper issue and the product is excellent, so I highly recommend this high-quality Argan oil!</li>
      <li>I am loving that this is now in 4oz vs the 2oz...</li>

      <li>It had a mild nutty scent (sort of reminded me of sesame oil) and was amazing on my skin!  </li>
      <li>Strongly recommend!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I loved the original Mogador argan oil (in the 2 oz) bottle that I bought and used up.  </li>
      <li>This brand Mogador has great quality of Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;Great for the face, It absorbs  very fast on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Great for your hair, it makes your hair look healthy, shiny and fuller.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure that it matches the color of spoiled canola oil.</li>
      <li>I noticed there is more of a nuttier aroma for the 4fl oz than the 2fl oz.  </li>
      <li>why pay more from Josie Marin when this is just as hood?  </li>
      <li>Love this oil.  </li>
      <li>The product is great, it has really improved my skin and hair.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for about 7 months now and absolutely love it for my face.  </li>
      <li>(since it was a better unit price).  </li>
      <li>satisfied with the results.</li>
      <li>Love the lightness and absorption of this oil.</li>
      <li>Love the way it absorbs into my skin and how it moisturizes my face.</li>
      <li>I thought it was time to find a better source.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>this is my second bottle :D</li>
      <li>but once I received the Mogador I realized they weren&#x27;t authentic.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this oil.</li>
      <li>Be sure you do not have a faulty bottle.</li>
      <li>I like this argan oil much better.  </li>
      <li>You had an amazing product when it&#x27;s fresh!</li>
      <li>Loved this product the first time I ordered it.</li>
      <li>I loved this the first time i bought it; I found it to be every bit as good as the Josie Maran brand- moisturizing capabilities, fast absorb-ability, texture, etc.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other brands, but this is truly the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>Oil is much cheaper than the more popular Aragon oil, but I didn&#x27;t notice a drop off  at all.  </li>
      <li>The difference is huge like going to a cadillac from a chevy.</li>
      <li>I use it twice a day and have seen and felt a huge difference.  </li>
      <li>I have experienced a definite difference in the softness of my skin and hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Purchased another brand of argan oil but the brand is no longer available on amazon  </li>
      <li>Skin is noticeably silky and smooth.</li>
      <li>Your skin will love it Worth every penny</li>
      <li>I turned on the light and realized the POP was the sound of the bottle cap popping up.  </li>
      <li>I tried the Jose Maran in the store and felt it was more greasier than this and took a lot longer to get absorbed into the skin.</li>
      <li>The real deal - great product, fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>Also, mine was very fresh when it arrived from the company.</li>
      <li>found this site very useful:</li>
      <li>excellent product wishing I had known about a long time ago  its pure, revitalizes skin helps strength nails/hair</li>
      <li>It has a pleasing smell and my skin absorbs it quickly, leaving it supple and smooth.</li>
      <li>Hopefully they will keep product true to form.</li>
      <li>I truly hope that my next bottle of Mogador will be as good as my first!</li>
      <li>and I already noticed how quickly it absorbs into my skin compared to GOW&#x27;s oil.</li>
      <li>It absorbed quickly and didn&#x27;t leave a greased up feel.</li>
      <li>At night I am pretty generous with the application (including my eye area!).</li>
      <li>This is the ideal product for dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>This is the ideal product for dry, sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I previously bought the 2 oz bottle of Mogador Certified Organic 100% Pure Argan Oil and LOVED IT!  </li>
      <li>The quality is good as I expected.  </li>
      <li>skin looks so healthy and soft.</li>
      <li>was originally certified organic and pure and after 2 yrs  I wasn&#x27;t seeing ecocert on their bottle.</li>
      <li>There are so many other argan oils out there that are better.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very effective without being heavy on the skin.</li>
      <li>Very thick but does an excellent job.&lt;br /&gt;Dropper is very useful and high quality.&lt;br /&gt;Great choice for hair.</li>
      <li>every bit as good as the first time, no nasty smell or other signs of being rancid;(see above).</li>
      <li>I try other brand which is not 100% pure in argan oil for my hair, it does good but cannot use on face because too greasy.</li>
      <li>It absorbs very fast on the skin.  </li>
      <li>shipment was very fast...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I loved this the first time i bought it; I found it to be every bit as good as the Josie Maran brand- moisturizing capabilities, fast absorb-ability, texture, etc. The dropper was not as good a quality as the J.M. brand, not defective, but it did not control the drops as well as the  one in the J.M. brand bottle- so I just swapped them out. I read some reviews that people got some rancid batches &amp; i&#x27;m nervous that will happen to me- I did buy a bottle of Plant Life Argan once that was rancid &amp; it was just as awful as the other reviewers describe. I truly hope that my next bottle of Mogador will be as good as my first! After I receive it I will update this post to let you know my impression.  ***UPDATE***  Received this via UPS about 2 days ago- every bit as good as the first time, no nasty smell or other signs of being rancid;(see above). Bottle, oil, dropper exactly same as my first purchase well over a year ago.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this oil. I had been using other Argan oils that claimed to be 100% Pure but once I received the Mogador I realized they weren&#x27;t authentic.</li>
    <li> Great for my face, greaat for my hair...been using it for three years now. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product!! Since the first time I used it I felt the change in my face. I like it and this is my second bottle :D give it a try!!!</li>
    <li> Superior product. I&#x27;ve been using the less expensive Watts organic argan oil for three years, was happy with the product and used it daily on skin and hair. A friend told me of the quality of this brand so bought to try. This is now my brand of choice. The difference is huge like going to a cadillac from a chevy. Spend the extra $ and buy this one.</li>
    <li> Have used this brand of argan oil for over 2 yrs now. I have very sensitive skin and this is all I use on my skin,I am 76 yar sold and my skin is still in real good condition</li>
    <li> excellent product wishing I had known about a long time ago  its pure, revitalizes skin helps strength nails/hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a models untold secret......... buy it you wont be sorry:D</li>
    <li> After I received this item, I compared it to the the oil I had purchased in Morrocco. And I am glad to say, it is exactly the same quality of oil. I mix a drop or 2 of this rich oil with my usual body lotion, and it leaves my skin soft with a subtle sheen.&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks so healthy and soft. This oil is not sticky or thick. Your skin absorbs it so easily and stays on until the next application.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!</li>
    <li> Purchased another brand of argan oil but the brand is no longer available on amazon  This argan oil is of high quality and is liquid gold  Your skin will love it Worth every penny</li>
    <li> Love love love it!! Makes my skin &amp; hair so soft😊</li>
    <li> I had the same problem as one of the other buyers of the 4oz bottle. I had the 2oz which was very pleasant and had a nutty smell. It absorbed quickly and didn&#x27;t leave a greased up feel. After i ran out, I ordered the  magador 4oz bottle but the bottle cap kept popping up and wasn&#x27;t able to seal it properly even after trying several times. The smell of the 4 oz bottle was different.. Nothing close to nutty.  It had a bag balm ointment smell to it. It felt greasy and didn&#x27;t absorb like the 2 oz magador bottle.</li>
    <li> I use this products on my face directly after I do the C6 laser treatment to erase the black spot on my face.  The quality is good as I expected.  I haven&#x27;t bought other brand becuase this one, the price is very competitive.  I try other brand which is not 100% pure in argan oil for my hair, it does good but cannot use on face because too greasy.</li>
    <li> This brand Mogador has great quality of Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;Great for the face, It absorbs  very fast on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Great for your hair, it makes your hair look healthy, shiny and fuller.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> Skin is noticeably silky and smooth. Small amount needed so it will last a long time. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 7 months now and absolutely love it for my face.  I live in a very dry climate where winters are the worst and I finally found something that helps with the severe dryness.  I use it twice a day and have seen and felt a huge difference.  In the morning I recommend applying the oil on your face immediately and letting it absorb for awhile before applying makeup.  At night I am pretty generous with the application (including my eye area!). Although this product is not certified by the USDA, it is certified by ECOCERT which is an international organic certification organization - the largest in the world. I have also used the Josie Maran oil which has a more likeable odor, but the comparative value of Mogador can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> Oil is much cheaper than the more popular Aragon oil, but I didn&#x27;t notice a drop off  at all.  I have recommended to my sister and mother as well</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle and I do like the oil for skin care, but the cap does not fit the bottle!  Once I removed the plastic seal the cap never screwed on the bottle properly and I have accidentally spilled it several times.  This wasn&#x27;t a problem with the first bottle I bought.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping!  Excellent product.  I  use this on my face and skin and makes my skin so soft without being gray</li>
    <li> I chose this product because of the 5 stars I saw about it. This product took all of 3 months to receive, Had to fight with Amazon about my not receiving it. had to be refunded and reorder twice! Tonight I finally got this oil. I highly reccomend that no one buys this oil from this company, unless they like to smell like mildew and mold! My Husband  prefers that I NEVER use this product because of the nasty smell.Buy any other Argon oil from another company, but unless you enjoy smelling like cheese, do not get this oil.Let alone all of the time and hassle in the ordering process. what a waste of money!.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Excellent product.  It absorbs very fast on the skin.  This is the ideal product for dry, sensitive skin. I use it on my whole body . A little goes a long way. I found the 4oz size a great value</li>
    <li> Has been wonderful for my face and neck. Does not feel greasy and absorbs totally. My skin is 100% improved.</li>
    <li> This oil has a very unpleasant odor; to say it has a nutty smell is really a stretch.  It is also very thick.  There are so many other argan oils out there that are better.  This one is going in the trash.</li>
    <li> Loved this product the first time I ordered it. When I ran out and ordered another, the bottle never closed properly because of a broken dropper that did not attach properly to the lid. But I didn&#x27;t discover that until I traveled with it. The entire, still full 4 oz. bottle poured out into my toiletry bag and suitcase, making a huge mess and ruining clothes. Be sure you do not have a faulty bottle.</li>
    <li> I became addicted to argan oil after receiving a Josie Maran kit for Christmas.  Since her products are on the more expensive side, I came on Amazon and did a quick search and ordered the first one that came up - that was a HUGE mistake, because after using Mogador, I realized that the stuff I ordered before was NOT argan oil (it was Sweet Essentials, if anyone has the misfortune of thinking of purchasing it).  Mogador smells like actual argan oil, actually absorbs into my skin, and has NOT made me break out - the cheap stuff I ordered before was doing all of those things, and it was miserable!  The price on Mogador is great, and you know you&#x27;re getting the good stuff!</li>
    <li> I have a shoe fetish.  When my skin is dry the heals of my feet turn white.  Matador argan oil is the ONLY product to eliminate the appearance of dry feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally both of my children have eczema.  Both kids love to swim and their skin takes a beating from the harsh chemicals in the pools.  After seeing a determatologist and confirming their conditions were eczema, I used the argan oil instead of the lotions suggested by the doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My entire household uses the product. I am purchasing enough to send to my daughter in college.</li>
    <li> This oil is wonderful- makes my face feel great</li>
    <li> A wonderful moisturizer for the face. My skin really absorbs it. It&#x27;s very effective without being heavy on the skin.</li>
    <li> I believe this product is just as luxurious as the much pricier &amp;#34;Josie Maran Argan Oil&amp;#34;.  It is an oil that takes awhile to soak in, but it is water soluable so it washes off completey.  You can use it for any area you want to moisturize.</li>
    <li> Excellent, I get compliments on my skin whenever I used this on my face.  It gives my 49 yr. skin a nice a nice healthy glow.</li>
    <li> Has nutty scent.  Very thick but does an excellent job.&lt;br /&gt;Dropper is very useful and high quality.&lt;br /&gt;Great choice for hair.</li>
    <li> Love the lightness and absorption of this oil.</li>
    <li> I decided to try Mogador Argan Oil after trying a sample of Josie Maran, which my too pricy for my tastes. I love it! My face feel so nice, and I feel as if it&#x27;s keeping the wrinkle at bay (I&#x27;m 28 and just beginning to get lines under my eyes). I use it twice a day. I dab a little under my eyes and then mix the rest with a drop or two of tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> I have tried SEVERAL brands of Argan oil. Mogador is actually the only one I trust. I can feel the difference from theirs and&lt;br /&gt;Others that lack the qualities of pure Argan. Don&#x27;t waste your money on other brands. You will see the results from this brand.&lt;br /&gt;My skin, hair, and nails are now in optional condition thanks to this brand. I have not been compensated for this review. Just my honest&lt;br /&gt;Opinion.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a while on my hair, and I really like the results. The hair looks healthier and kind of revived after 1 hr of mask with this oil.</li>
    <li> I have been using another brand of argan oil and decided to try this one.  I&#x27;m 70 and I find this really keeps my skin smooth and soft.  I also use it on my hair which has been color treated and it gives it shine.  I really like this product and would reorder.</li>
    <li> Love this oil.  My skin feels great.</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve used other brands, but this is truly the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I bought this particular oil because it costs less than other brands.  It is very thin and watery compared to another brand of pur argan oil that I have.  Quality is not worth the money!</li>
    <li> Perfection! I love this oil, has so many uses with a pleasant but not overpowering scent.  I use it with glycerin I also bought on Amazon for a supplemental eye serum.  LOVE IT! Strongly recommend!</li>
    <li> The real deal - great product, fast shipping.  This is the ideal product for dry, sensitive skin.  I use it on my whole body.  To make it go further,  I sometimes mix it with my regular fragrance free lotion.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, non comedogenic. Great for nails and cuticles. I used on my face at night too. Got some dry flaky patches at first, but once they were exfoliated away, product left my skin nice and soft. Absorbs very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been getting my Argan oil from Garden of Wisdom for quite some time now but I grew wary of its quality and source once I learned that oils shouldn&#x27;t be stored and sent in clear/white plastic bottles. I thought it was time to find a better source. I tried Josie Maran&#x27;s argan oil but it&#x27;s ridiculously priced and just worked as well as GOW&#x27;s argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Mogador&#x27;s oil two times now and I already noticed how quickly it absorbs into my skin compared to GOW&#x27;s oil. My friend tried my GOW oil before and even mentioned that she could still feel it on her skin after a few hours. Mogador&#x27;s argan has a slight nutty scent which I don&#x27;t mind at all. I actually like it! Once applied, the smell goes away anyway. Last night, I applied it to the ends of my hair and my hair is not weighed down as much as GOW&#x27;s oil. The 4 oz bottle is huge and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this site very useful: [...]</li>
    <li> This is excellent oil...why pay more from Josie Marin when this is just as hood?  Great find!  Thank you.  O</li>
    <li> Love the way it absorbs into my skin and how it moisturizes my face. I don&#x27;t need to spend a lot on expensive face and eye creams and instead use this. I tried the Jose Maran in the store and felt it was more greasier than this and took a lot longer to get absorbed into the skin.I like this argan oil much better.  I put more of the argan oil in my under eye area and it does a good job in keeping that area moisturized. I noticed there is more of a nuttier aroma for the 4fl oz than the 2fl oz.  A 2fl oz bottle, using it only on my face twice a day lasted a little more than a year. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I was looking at Argan oils and after reading reviews about different brands, decided on Mogador.&lt;br /&gt;Having finished the 2-oz. Bottle, its time to give a few comments.  The oil is thicker than, say, olive oil, but not a lot. Pleasant nutty smell. Each night it would get rubbed on a scar and it seemed to diminish the prominence.  On the face, it smoothed lines, softened skin and left a fresher look. Perhaps, other&lt;br /&gt;types of oils (almond,jojoba,olive) would do the same,who knows?  Since results have been positive, will get the 2 oz. bottle now. Remember freshness is a consideration, so buy smaller amounts until you find how much use you have for it.  Also, mine was very fresh when it arrived from the company. The purchase was in August 2013  and it has lasted until Feb. 2014 for the two ounce bottle.</li>
    <li> I went to great lengths to be sure this was certified as another I was using that I bought from Amazon was originally certified organic and pure and after 2 yrs  I wasn&#x27;t seeing ecocert on their bottle. I found the import documentation where Mogador is listed so I have no doubts about what I am using. Hopefully they will keep product true to form.</li>
    <li> The product is great, it has really improved my skin and hair. However, the lid does not stay on the bottle well and so I can&#x27;t travel with it, which is why I give it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I previously bought the 2 oz bottle of Mogador Certified Organic 100% Pure Argan Oil and LOVED IT!  It had a mild nutty scent (sort of reminded me of sesame oil) and was amazing on my skin!  When I was almost out of that bottle, I decided to buy the 4 oz (since it was a better unit price).  BIG MISTAKE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BROKEN ILL-FITTING BOTTLE CAP:&lt;br /&gt;I received the bottle and the first thing I noticed was that even though the plastic safety seal was intact, the plastic bottle cap was broken/cracked.  Also, the bottle cap would NOT stay on.  After using it in the evening, I tightened the bottle cap as best as I could and then went to bed.  While lying in bed, I heard a POP!  I turned on the light and realized the POP was the sound of the bottle cap popping up.  The bottle cap just does NOT stay on the bottle no matter what you do (I think the size is wrong).  That explains why the bottle cap was cracked beneath the intact plastic safety seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OIL SMELLED SOUR:&lt;br /&gt;I know what my original bottle of Mogador argan oil smelled like -- it was pleasantly nutty (sort of like sesame oil).  This bottle smelled sour (best adjective I can think of....the smell is hard to describe, but you know something is &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; when you smell it).  I can only assume that the oil turned bad after being exposed to air from the broken cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I loved the original Mogador argan oil (in the 2 oz) bottle that I bought and used up.  This bottle was a big disappointment.  Not only was the bottle cap broken/cracked, it&#x27;s apparent that the bottle cap broke because it is not the right size for the bottle.  Even more upsetting (and the main reason why I am giving this item a poor one-star review) is that the oil was rancid/sour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am upset.  The only thing that made me feel better was that I contacted Amazon and they refunded my money.  I am scared to buy this 4 oz bottle again because I don&#x27;t want to have the same problem.  I think I&#x27;ll go back to buying the2 oz bottle.  If anyone from Mogador is reading this -- please please please change the bottle/cap that you use. I think the whole problem with the oil being sour/rancid is because it was exposed to air after the ill-fitting bottle cap broke/cracked.  You had an amazing product when it&#x27;s fresh!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have experienced a definite difference in the softness of my skin and hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously, I had purchased the 2 oz. size and this was the first time I ordered the 4 oz. bottle.  Like others have mentioned, I had trouble with the dropper cap staying on the bottle.  No matter how much I tried to tighten it, it would come loose.  However, when I contacted the company to let them know about the problem, they apologized for the problem and immediately sent me a new dropper which fits perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think they have now addressed the ill-fitting dropper issue and the product is excellent, so I highly recommend this high-quality Argan oil!</li>
    <li> Says &amp;#34;Certified Organic&amp;#34; but no where on the packaging is the official USDA certified seal. Plus, doesn&#x27;t have expiration dates or manufacturing lot numbers. Sort of sketchy</li>
    <li> I get terrible headaches from this oil on my face.</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil on my hair and skin and could not be happier with the result... this seller is the best... shipment was very fast...I am loving that this is now in 4oz vs the 2oz... I will not purchase this oil from anyone else... or will I use any other oil in my hair and on my skin.... give this a try you will be happy you did...</li>
    <li> Fantastic product - Great value!</li>
    <li> I have acne prone flakey skin on my face. I was hesitant to use an oil on my face but it did not break me out, and made my skin very soft. It really moisturized well and helped get rid of my flaky skin. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy going on and absorbs very quickly, getting rid of that tight feeling I get after washing my face. I love it. I just use it at night. I also use it daily on my hands and nails/cuticles. My cuticles are very dry and peely and this helps heal them right up. It&#x27;s also great on the ends of hair for split ends and it helps get rid of the frizziness. It does have a slight smell, kind of a burnt wood smell which I have found typical of all argan oil. This is a great quality multipurpose oil for a nice price. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with dry skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased the 4 ounce bottle to avoid shipping costs and now I&#x27;m saddled with a large amount of an oil that I&#x27;m positive isn&#x27;t argan. I&#x27;ve been using argan oil for years. It has a pleasing smell and my skin absorbs it quickly, leaving it supple and smooth. Neither is the case with this oil. I read in other reviews (that I wish I had heeded) that the smell of Mogador&#x27;s oil is somewhat rancid and that&#x27;s exactly how I would describe it. I can&#x27;t judge the color as the bottle is dark brown glass but I&#x27;m sure that it matches the color of spoiled canola oil. My skin seems to reject it as it sits on its surface like an oil spill does on rubber. Based on the smell, color, and performance, I would say that if this is argan oil, it&#x27;s of such poor quality that it shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to be sold as such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From now on, I&#x27;m going to buy only the oils that I can sample in person as it&#x27;s too easy for unscrupulous businesses to sell so-called pure products to trusting buyers.</li>
