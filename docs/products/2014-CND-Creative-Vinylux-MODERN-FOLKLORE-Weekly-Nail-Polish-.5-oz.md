      <li>THESE ARE NICE AUTUMN/WINTER COLORS.  </li>
      <li>Nice colors.</li>
      <li>Nice variety of polish colors.</li>
      <li>After I apply, I do not do dishes for 24 hours, to let the color set (it&#x27;s a nice mini vaca from dishes).</li>
      <li>Full size polish and great fall and winter colors.</li>
      <li>great polish...stays looking like a fresh manicure for over 1 week....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Vinylux line for more than 2 years already.</li>
      <li>It is more orange than copper, but has some shimmer to it.&lt;br /&gt;Rose</li>
      <li>And I can&#x27;t imagine polish better than Vinylux.</li>
      <li>2 coats of top coat.</li>
      <li>LOVE VINYLUX</li>
      <li>I was quite satisfied with my order.</li>
      <li>Pushing with the Vinylux top coat I easily get 5 days of wear from my polish.</li>
      <li>you apply two coats and then the top coat, no base coat is needed.</li>
      <li>It stays on for a good week and it is very durable.  </li>
      <li>This pack has great colors and as for the lasting part, it is just ok.</li>
      <li>It was so easy -</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty amazing stuff.</li>
      <li>Love this nail Polish, It lasts longer than any other,  Removes easily and the price is great.</li>
      <li>it lasts about a week; if there is any chipping it starts right at the top of the nail....</li>
      <li>And in all fairness I was just excited to receive it</li>
      <li>I have yet to get a full chip free week</li>
      <li>perfect, they do last longer than regular polish, buy the top coat as a separate product</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would like the orage as much as I do, but it is really cute on.</li>
      <li>Really love this polish fast shipping</li>
      <li>Brocade is the color I was most looking forward to as it looked like a beautiful pink on the description, but in person it really is more of a red color with a pinkish tone to it.</li>
      <li>then I put the Super Shiney;</li>
      <li>Shipment from this seller was quick.</li>
      <li>Pretty colors; I like it so much I ordered more colors....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really pretty!</li>
      <li>So far from this bundle I&#x27;ve used the orangey color and the gold looking one, love them both.</li>
      <li>The red in particular looks striking against light skin with cool tones.  </li>
      <li>love that it&#x27;s completely dry so quick!</li>
      <li>Did not last more than 48 hours.</li>
      <li>I am definitely buying more shades.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so good at giving myself manicures and pedis because this stuff lasts longer and is a lot less expense than going to a manicurist!</li>
      <li>which isn&#x27;t very noticable at first....</li>
      <li>it came off easily with regular polish remover.</li>
      <li>It is very shimmery and is a goldfish/silver color.&lt;br /&gt;Fine</li>
      <li>very pretty!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>Fabulous product - terrific product.</li>
      <li>Stays on really well without chipping.</li>
      <li>nail polish stays on well, just very mislead.  </li>
      <li>and you can&#x27;t really tell.</li>
      <li>As always, CND makes a long-lasting, easy-to-apply formula that dries fast, maintains shine, and doesn&#x27;t stain nails.  </li>
      <li>I am particularly fond of the sparkly gold shade, too.  </li>
      <li>Did not like, does not stay for long time, did not dry quickly and scratched very fast, from the first touch of objects.</li>
      <li>I am a big fan of this line not only does it dry in less than 10 minutes, but the colors are beautiful and I love the lasting shine.  </li>
      <li>The purple, navy, and light pink are not too shiny, so these are the ones I will be using.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only nail polish that will last for more than a week on natural nails.</li>
      <li>I gave away a shoe box filled with other brands because I prefer this line.</li>
      <li>At first it seemed to last a lot longer</li>
      <li>Product seems used or old.</li>
      <li>As long as you use the Scrub Fresh and the top coat, per the directions, this polish will last at least a week with NO chipping!</li>

<li> They seem to last longer than any other polish I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

<li> I have used other much better polish brands and was disappointed of this</li>
<li> Getting rid of all other polishes.</li>
<li> It seems like it might not be authentic :(</li>
<li> The price is comparable to other brands used in salons.</li>
<li> Instead they gave me gray in my pack with the other colors.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t get the pink color!!!</li>
<li> again; like everyone else has stated put two light coats on over base coat</li>
<li> I can not stress the thin layers enough,</li>
<li> so every day I was anxious for it.</li>
<li> though!&lt;br /&gt;Use sticky base first.</li>
<li> My salon wanted to charge me some ridiculous price for using this polish over an ordinary polish</li>
<li> but I am hard on my nails.  </li>
<li> I like the fact that the polish lasts for 7-10 days without destroying your nail bed!!</li>
<li> but they are very small chips</li>
<li> Seriously works.</li>
<li> BUT I was greatly disappointed when I tried these specific polishes.</li>
<li> Thin layers!!</li>
<li> Disappointed.</li>
<li> I was disappointed with the colors.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love Vinylux! I like the fact that the polish lasts for 7-10 days without destroying your nail bed!!</li>
    <li> Great fall colors - love this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Vinylux line for more than 2 years already. And I can&#x27;t imagine polish better than Vinylux. BUT I was greatly disappointed when I tried these specific polishes. The nails start chipping the next day after putting it on! I have never seen such! How could it be within the same line? It seems like it might not be authentic :(</li>
    <li> Did not like, does not stay for long time, did not dry quickly and scratched very fast, from the first touch of objects. I have used other much better polish brands and was disappointed of this</li>
    <li> Fall colors are great.</li>
    <li> Good color choices. Seems durable, but I have yet to go a week with out chips.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the pink color!!! Instead they gave me gray in my pack with the other colors.&lt;br /&gt;This polish is very good though!&lt;br /&gt;Use sticky base first. 2 coats of polish. 2 coats of top coat.</li>
    <li> Love all six colors!  The red in particular looks striking against light skin with cool tones.  I am particularly fond of the sparkly gold shade, too.  As always, CND makes a long-lasting, easy-to-apply formula that dries fast, maintains shine, and doesn&#x27;t stain nails.  All you need is their topcoat to make it last.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for more!  I am definitely buying more shades.</li>
    <li> Product seems used or old. Colors are also not what I expected. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the vinyl nail polishes! They seem to last longer than any other polish I&#x27;ve tried. With that being said, I would like to point out the differences in the colors I received and the colors pictured. I did receive all the correct colors as listed, they are just different than what I saw pictured on the item description.&lt;br /&gt;Locket Love is a beautiful color! It is very shimmery and is a goldfish/silver color.&lt;br /&gt;Fine Vermillion is a copperish orange. It is more orange than copper, but has some shimmer to it.&lt;br /&gt;Rose Brocade is the color I was most looking forward to as it looked like a beautiful pink on the description, but in person it really is more of a red color with a pinkish tone to it. (think blueish red)&lt;br /&gt;Crimson Sash is a shimmery burgandy color. very pretty!&lt;br /&gt;Indigo Frock is a beautiful steely blue-gray. Gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;Plum Paisley is a shimmery deep purple. It&#x27;s really pretty!</li>
    <li> Seriously works. Getting rid of all other polishes.</li>
    <li> I love this polish! When they say it lasts a week they&#x27;re not lying; actually in some cases it lasts longer! That&#x27;s why I bought all these colors - I plan to use this polish exclusively because it is that good! My salon wanted to charge me some ridiculous price for using this polish over an ordinary polish so I ordered one bottle of it to try it out. It was so easy - you apply two coats and then the top coat, no base coat is needed. It lasted for over a week. Since then I&#x27;ve purchased like 8 or 9 different colors.  I&#x27;ve gotten so good at giving myself manicures and pedis because this stuff lasts longer and is a lot less expense than going to a manicurist!</li>
    <li> Really love this polish fast shipping</li>
    <li> This polish didnot stay on any longer with out shipping than regular polish.I was very disappointed..</li>
    <li> Nice colors. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d go back to regular nail-polish for my fingers because this one lasts all week! It&#x27;s pretty amazing stuff.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE NICE AUTUMN/WINTER COLORS.  LOVE VINYLUX</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of this line not only does it dry in less than 10 minutes, but the colors are beautiful and I love the lasting shine.  I have yet to get a full chip free week but I am hard on my nails.  After I apply, I do not do dishes for 24 hours, to let the color set (it&#x27;s a nice mini vaca from dishes). The longer it sets the harder it becomes. After that I use gloves to do dishes.  I can not stress the thin layers enough, if you use too much of the product it will bubble, it&#x27;s not a good look. So far from this bundle I&#x27;ve used the orangey color and the gold looking one, love them both. I didn&#x27;t think I would like the orage as much as I do, but it is really cute on. I will countine to purchase, use and recommend. Thin layers!!</li>
    <li> Great polish! It stayed on longer than a week. No chips and it came off easily with regular polish remover.</li>
    <li> Did not last more than 48 hours. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Some of the colors did not look at they appeared to be online.</li>
    <li> Polish didn&#x27;t last on me</li>
    <li> Love this polish!  Stays on really well without chipping.</li>
    <li> I put it on and three nail were chipped up in two days the rest seems to hold but not as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> This pack has great colors and as for the lasting part, it is just ok. At first it seemed to last a lot longer but it is chipping within three days but they are very small chips and you can&#x27;t really tell. Overall, I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Once I received this nail polish I was quite satisfied with my order.</li>
    <li> Full size polish and great fall and winter colors.</li>
    <li> Love this nail Polish, It lasts longer than any other,  Removes easily and the price is great.</li>
    <li> This product works SO well. As long as you use the Scrub Fresh and the top coat, per the directions, this polish will last at least a week with NO chipping!</li>
    <li> outstanding nail polish! love that it&#x27;s completely dry so quick!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with the colors. They all are shiny/metallic-y, as opposed to the matte that they look in this picture.  The one on the left, for instance, is a glittery gold, not an ivory.  The purple, navy, and light pink are not too shiny, so these are the ones I will be using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail polish stays on well, just very mislead.  I would not have purchased this if the colors were more clear on the description, and unfortunately this product is not able to be returned.</li>
    <li> perfect, they do last longer than regular polish, buy the top coat as a separate product</li>
    <li> Nice variety of polish colors.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only nail polish that will last for more than a week on natural nails.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product - terrific product.</li>
    <li> I love the colors! Pushing with the Vinylux top coat I easily get 5 days of wear from my polish. I gave away a shoe box filled with other brands because I prefer this line. The price is comparable to other brands used in salons. Shipment from this seller was quick.</li>
    <li> Great polish. Packaged well. It seemed to take a while to arrive but it was shipped US postal. And in all fairness I was just excited to receive it so every day I was anxious for it.</li>
    <li> great polish...stays looking like a fresh manicure for over 1 week....sometimes 2 weeks...depends on activity....great colors in this kit</li>
    <li> Pretty colors; I like it so much I ordered more colors....again; like everyone else has stated put two light coats on over base coat then I put the Super Shiney; one coat and it lasts about a week; if there is any chipping it starts right at the top of the nail....which isn&#x27;t very noticable at first....I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish! It stays on for a good week and it is very durable.  My only issue with this order is the pink you see in the picture is actually red.</li>
