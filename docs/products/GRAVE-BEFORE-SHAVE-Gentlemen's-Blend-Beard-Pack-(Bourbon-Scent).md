      <li>GBS Gentlemans Blend smells amazing.</li>
      <li>Smells absolutely amazing.  </li>
      <li>Bought for a friend after buying my own kit.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know my beard could feel so smooth and well loved.</li>
      <li>so I had to order some of my own magical concoction.</li>
      <li>The balm might work better in longer beard, but I still use it because it gives a great shine and helps my beard look and feel really fresh.</li>
      <li>Definitely the best scent they make.</li>
      <li>the oil and balm are great, and my 4 month old/long beard definitely really likes these products.</li>
      <li>Will be buying again, maybe more scents as well.</li>
      <li>My beard smells much better now and feels a bit softer but nothing miraculous.</li>
      <li>Love that one, love this as well.</li>
      <li>Fisticuffs always has top notch products I use my oil at night and the balm in the morning to keep my beard conditioned and controlled</li>
      <li>Altogether, I am planning to buy more when I run out.</li>
      <li>Love all of there oil&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Love the bourbon scent too.</li>
      <li>I love the smell.</li>
      <li>I love all of the Grave Before Shave product</li>
      <li>Love the oils and Balms.</li>
      <li>my favorite sent that they have come out with.</li>
      <li>It smells very clean and is not overpowering at all.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and the product is amazing!</li>
      <li>A nice manly scent for a super manly beard.  </li>
      <li>I use Fisticuffs old fashioned mustache wax also and the scents mix great.</li>
      <li>Wayne seems like a really cool dude!</li>
      <li>The oil goes a long way and keeps my beard in good shape, for an inch long beard, I use like 4 drops and it spreads perfectly.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t identify the scent as &amp;#34;bourbon&amp;#34;, and it&#x27;s definitely a lot lighter in scent strength than the Bay Rum, but very nice.</li>
      <li>My first foray into beard maintenance, and it couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
      <li>Not too strong, but just right intensity.</li>
      <li>As always he sends some sweet stickers with your order.</li>
      <li>Great masculine scent that my wife loves, and it leaves my beard soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>Great clean subtle scent wife loves it</li>
      <li>Products have a nice scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering, they do what they are supposed to do, reasonably priced compared to some other brands and free stickers.</li>
      <li>I like the oil better as it is easier to apply ( three drops is enough)</li>
      <li>At first I could not place exactly what it smelled like but yesterday I found a candle that smells just like it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a sucker for great branding</li>
      <li>Every bottle was consistent and of the highest quality.</li>
      <li>I usually use Bay Rum, but this was a good sale</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s what real men do.</li>
      <li>Thanks GBS.</li>
      <li>very well.&lt;br /&gt;Bonus</li>
      <li>/&gt;It takes care of the itching or dry or flaking skin below the facial hair (which was a huge issue for me before) and my beard feels well conditioned and smoother in my manly fingers.</li>
      <li>but I have to say this is by far</li>
      <li>Keeps the face fur soft and supple.</li>
      <li>It smells like an old school barbershop.</li>
      <li>If you never used a beard oil I would recommend this one as it is half the price as other brands, smells better and feels the same on the beard.</li>
      <li>The scent of both is soft, but lasts long.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> GBS Gentlemans Blend smells amazing. Love the oils and Balms. Both work well and keep my Beard looking and smelling great.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Wayne.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Works even better! Will be buy this again!</li>
    <li> Great clean subtle scent wife loves it</li>
    <li> I love all of the Grave Before Shave product but I have to say this is by far my favorite sent that they have come out with. Great product that leaves your beard smelling and feeling awesome.</li>
    <li> Best oils and balms out there. I usually use Bay Rum, but this was a good sale so I opted for this scent. I have been using this brand for over a year, and I have never had an issue. Every bottle was consistent and of the highest quality.</li>
    <li> I have been using different brands of balms and oils but I always end up coming back to this brand. Products have a nice scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering, they do what they are supposed to do, reasonably priced compared to some other brands and free stickers.</li>
    <li> Once again Wayne knocks it out of the park. I usually use his bay rum products, but had to try the new &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34;. Great masculine scent that my wife loves, and it leaves my beard soft and manageable. As always he sends some sweet stickers with your order.</li>
    <li> Iam a GBS fan! Love all of there oil&#x27;s. This one is great LOVE the smell. I own all oil&#x27;s have to say this is one of my Fav! Thanks GBS. GOD BLESS!</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff! This is my second purchase from Fisticuffs! Fast shipping and the product is amazing! Wayne seems like a really cool dude! Definitely buying from them again!</li>
    <li> Definitely the best scent they make. The oil for daily use and the balm when you need to tame the beard a bit.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know my beard could feel so smooth and well loved. It&#x27;s hard to take a day off now. I&#x27;m hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes care of the itching or dry or flaking skin below the facial hair (which was a huge issue for me before) and my beard feels well conditioned and smoother in my manly fingers. I use a boars hair brush every morning after application. And if I&#x27;m feeling extra manly, I even twist those mustache hairs to do what I tell them to do. Cuz that&#x27;s what real men do. Altogether, I am planning to buy more when I run out. Love the bourbon scent too. Not too strong, but just right intensity.</li>
    <li> Got the beard oil and balm in the Gentelmen&#x27;s blend (bourbon scent). I have not really noticed a major improvement on my beard. I like the oil better as it is easier to apply ( three drops is enough) the scent is mild and very pleasant. It smells like an old school barbershop. It smells very clean and is not overpowering at all. At first I could not place exactly what it smelled like but yesterday I found a candle that smells just like it. It was a sandalwood and lavender candle. My beard smells much better now and feels a bit softer but nothing miraculous. Good product for the price. Good smell. Does not leave beard feeling greasy at all. If you never used a beard oil I would recommend this one as it is half the price as other brands, smells better and feels the same on the beard.</li>
    <li> Smells absolutely amazing.  A nice manly scent for a super manly beard.  Keeps the face fur soft and supple.</li>
    <li> The oil goes a long way and keeps my beard in good shape, for an inch long beard, I use like 4 drops and it spreads perfectly. The balm might work better in longer beard, but I still use it because it gives a great shine and helps my beard look and feel really fresh. The scent of both is soft, but lasts long. My wife loves the smell. I use Fisticuffs old fashioned mustache wax also and the scents mix great.</li>
    <li> Holy mackerel -- had a beard for years until this year grew it out. This wiry explosion of whiskers needed taming. Stopped at a barber who whipped my facial follicles into shape and introduced me to oil and balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had no idea this is how a man is meant to master his frontal mane so I had to order some of my own magical concoction. I&#x27;m a sucker for great branding so took a chance on GBS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thrilled to report the instantly happy responses from mother, wife and spawn. Pleasurably aroma and shapely hold. How has my beard balm &amp; oil ignorance lasted so long?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been two weeks now, beard feels softer and doesn&#x27;t get so crazy... Now I need to try the moustache wax and my like will be complete!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and stickers!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought for a friend after buying my own kit. We are both quite happy and so are our girlfriends.</li>
    <li> I love the smell. Grave Before Shave makes great products.</li>
    <li> Fisticuffs always has top notch products I use my oil at night and the balm in the morning to keep my beard conditioned and controlled</li>
    <li> Bought this after buying and using the Bay Rum scented kit. Love that one, love this as well. I wouldn&#x27;t identify the scent as &amp;#34;bourbon&amp;#34;, and it&#x27;s definitely a lot lighter in scent strength than the Bay Rum, but very nice. Maybe a bit of vanilla in there...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the oil and balm are great, and my 4 month old/long beard definitely really likes these products. I have curly hair and they tame the crazy mess very well.&lt;br /&gt;Bonus stickers included in the kit as well. Will be buying again, maybe more scents as well.</li>
    <li> My first foray into beard maintenance, and it couldn&#x27;t be better. No longer am I given money on the street for looking disheveled. Smells great, feels great.</li>
    <li> Love it! The smell of good.</li>
