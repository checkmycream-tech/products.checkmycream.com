<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got this wig as a joke for my wife but got to say she looks hot in it</li>
    <li> Loved it!!!!  Wore it for a Poison Ivy Halloween costume and will probably wear it out and about :)  Vibrant color and super fun. Curls held up well until I got careless with it.  Hoping I can fix it back up. Very fun!! Great for the price - I only wish it was heat resistant so I could style it in the future.</li>
    <li> This wig is great! It&#x27;s very beautiful and the color is so lovely! I love it and I love it even more because of the price! Would buy again!</li>
    <li> Well I was looking for a RED WIG &amp; WOW I sure did get it LOL!!! The shipping was Fast &amp; I got it faster than another wig I ordered from another place a wk Pryor... So Thank You I will be ordering again soon....</li>
    <li> I was a little bit scared because I thought hmmm it&#x27;s a really cheap wig it might not be so great but when I got it it was sooo nice!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using this for my poison ivy cosplay and i&#x27;s perfect i got it in wine red!&lt;br /&gt;It looks exactly like in the picture and yeah the bangs are pretty long but nothing a little chop chop can&#x27;t fix haha!</li>
    <li> This wig gets my seal of AWESOMENESS! It is THICK and makes me feel like a Movie Star. The color (see my facebook profile pic &amp;#34;la fekken&amp;#34;) and see how nice it goes with my pale Irish skin. The quality is beyond better than I&#x27;d imagined. I am crazy for this wig.&lt;br /&gt;SEXY bangs on it. I am not used to such long bangs and they fall in my eyes a lot, but who cares IT LOOKS &amp; FEELS SO COOL!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re not fond of super glossy wigs, skip this one. Otherwise this color,length and style of this wig are nice and it&#x27;s a fun,cute wig for a nice change. Not a believable wig for the purpose of daily wear but for dress up or to change things up for your significant other (which is why I use them and so he&#x27;s aware it&#x27;s a wig) this is a great wig. Shipped to me from China but arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> The wig arrived in perfect condition, wrapped neatly. It even came with a wig net, which I hadn&#x27;t been aware of. It was very simple to put on, and did not straighten out, tangle, or anything of that sort throughout the day of me wearing it. It was not uncomfortable, and reached my mid-back.</li>
    <li> i needed a wig for my Poison Ivy cosplay and after seeing the positive reviews, i took the plunge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-the order came in WAY sooner than i had expected (approx a week to a week and a half after i had ordered!).&lt;br /&gt;-the overall fit is comfortable and like the seller says, you can adjust the clips in the wig cap to your liking. i had to fuss around with the (longer than i expected) bangs a bit to get it to where i wanted, but nothing some hairspray and a few bobby pins couldn&#x27;t handle.&lt;br /&gt;-the wig itself is shiny, vibrant and soft to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m very pleased with my order and this won&#x27;t be the last time i order from this seller.</li>
    <li> Great wig, very comfortable and easy to maintain.</li>
    <li> Fun wig! Better if you wear a hat with it!</li>
    <li> Awesome wig for an awesome price. I used this item for a poison ivy cosplay, there were people who didn&#x27;t beleive it was fake hair. My only complaint is that it is very tangled after a couple of wears but that is to be expected with hair this long. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; and it comes to my hips and looks awesome.</li>
    <li> The bangs were a little funky- so long that it was hard to tell what was supposed to be bangs as opposed to another layer of hair. The color was gorgeous, a little brighter than the picture but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be spot on. Biggest issue for me was just the size. Too small for me to be able to use it, because it sits really awkwardly. For someone with a smaller head than me though I feel like it would be just fine.</li>
    <li> Pretty wig but not as long and thought the red would be brighter. But nice.</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured. Curls look so cute. Nice and neat wig, very polished. Fast shipping too. Usually the wigs I order from other places do not look like the ones pictured, this one is spot-on.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not long and curly like the picture but it&#x27;s fine. I might keep it or return it I&#x27;m not sure yet.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Super soft and looks like the picture.  Like all wigs, you have to be careful about tangles, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like this one would be too much of a problem since it&#x27;s so soft.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to others.  Will provide picture soon.</li>
    <li> Ordered this wig on the 5th and just received it yesterday it&#x27;s pretty and long but for some reason the bangs on mine are very weird can&#x27;t explain but I don&#x27;t like how they look on me but I&#x27;m sure I can figure something out or take it to a hairstylist and fix the bangs up some way and they also smelled like mildew when received but I washed it with some Aussie in the sink sprayed a bit of perfume now it smells lovely. Overall still pretty. And goes all the way down my back (5&#x27;0) and shipping time was great this time around .</li>
    <li> The wig is a gorgeous color and a great length.  The only thing is it is pretty thin, so if you have naturally thick hair, it will be pretty difficult to hide your own hair under it.</li>
    <li> I liked the on-line picture,but in person I was pleasantly suprised how pretty this wig is. The color and qualty of the hair are great. I purchased it for a costume, but it&#x27;s so nice I might consider wearing it sans costume! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> A high quality product.&lt;br /&gt;I think it was the best choice!&lt;br /&gt;Good delivery time.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent relationship between price and service.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> The back is beautiful. But the problem is the way it&#x27;s designed in the front, it has a very off styling that I&#x27;m not to happy with. I have to figure out how to style it in a more natural way. Either that or wearing a hat may make it better</li>
    <li> just love mapofbeauty....wigs are so outstanding...look here if you want an outstanding look</li>
    <li> The wig doesn&#x27;t look anything like the picture. It fit nice, but there were no bangs and it just barely touched my shoulders. For the price it will work for what I need it for, but I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it.</li>
    <li> Color is not what is pictured. I feel that the color is actually a ugly red. And the cap is too small for me. I might be able to pull this off with a hat but it defiantly won&#x27;t work with out it.</li>
    <li> This wig is great quality and is very soft and fits great.  BUT!!!  THe color is totally mis-represented.  This wig is a very dark almost purple-ish burgundy color and is not the bright red that is shown in the picture.  If the color was better, I would have given it five stars for sure since it is such a great quality for the price!!!</li>
    <li> Love it but can&#x27;t brush it without ruining it</li>
    <li> I bought this wig in wine red for a little mermaid thing and I love it!! I was not expecting such a good quality wig for the price! It&#x27;s very full, very soft, and its not as shiny as I was expecting. It fits very well. The bangs were a little long in the front but the curls hold up well. As far as heat resistant, I recommend only using lower heat settings with it. It came about week before the confirmation said it would. Very nice.</li>
    <li> I ordered this based on the reviews that it was an ok product. That person must have been blind. I received it in about3 weeks, when it got here, I will say its a beautiful color but that&#x27;s it. It was misshapened like its been in a box for months and the back tracks stuck out so bad, I could only wear with a hat. Even with the hat, it was still just wrong, curly, flat, nappy. I placed a claim with the seller, we will see how they handle it. Hopefully they take care of this problem because I will update to tell you all how  the outcome went.</li>
    <li> i got this wig really fast . it is a beautiful burgundy color that like poison ivy or black widow . it came in a nice package , the wig net is not so good so make sure to have your own .</li>
    <li> the wig itself is great but i bought it for halloween and the shipping took way longer than expected. So just be sure you give yourself plenty of time if you want this.</li>
    <li> I purchased this wig for Comic Con and Halloween. After looking at several local stores, I noticed the quality can be poor for even a $20 wig. Getting this wig for $11 was a steal! When it arrived I immediately noticed the quality. It&#x27;s shiny, bouncy and a vibrant red color. Everyone who saw me in it asked me if I dyed my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Looks realistic in texture- realistic shine and bounce&lt;br /&gt;- Curls keep their shape and look realistic&lt;br /&gt;- Beautiful length true to pictures&lt;br /&gt;- Comfortable fit- there are straps in the back that can tighten the fit to your head&lt;br /&gt;- Wears well- used several times and it&#x27;s still in good shape. Not tangles, and has not shed many strands at all.&lt;br /&gt;- Fun vibrant color- be prepared to get lots of attention!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Did not come with head stocking as a previous reviewer noted. Not sure if they changed that. But it does come with a cheap net to protect it. Mine ripped within 2 seconds of taking out the wig. Wish that was better quality for future storing.&lt;br /&gt;- Vibrant red color is a little too intense for a natural redhead look. People will think you dyed your hair or are wearing a wig, probably won&#x27;t think you were born with that hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall 5 stars. A fantastic value for the cost! Check out the additional photos by clicking the link \\&quot;See all customer images\\&quot; beneath the main photo to see how it looks on a variety of people.</li>
    <li> This wig is absolutely gorgeous! Once you style it a bit on your head, it looks very real. You can&#x27;t go wrong, especially with the price! The red is more a dark wine color, rather than the bright red that it looks like. I ordered it for a mermaid costume, but it&#x27;s not bright enough. I have switched costumes just so I can wear this wig. I received it MUCH faster then they said I would.</li>
    <li> I expected this wig to be darker in color, but it ended up being more of a bright red. Because of this, I did not feel comfortable wearing it out in public and it ended up just staying in the box. If you look at the product pictures, it is closer to being the color of the top picture and not the wine red color of the pictures below. If you are looking for a darker red, I would advise against this one.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for my Ariel costume for halloween. I was a little worried it wouldnt get here in time but just like the other reviews I have read it got to my house quicker than expected. The color is BEAUTIFUL, it fits really well. Its very soft and pretty. I will definitely recommend this seller to friends and will be buying from them again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s similar to one in the pic but is little different in color.</li>
    <li> This wig is beautiful when it comes in.  Very high quality and very soft. This is a better wig than many you see in the store for 2x the price.</li>
    <li> The only reason this got 4 instead of 5 stars is the fact that its really not as curly as it looks in the pictures, but other than that it&#x27;s really nice.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s soft, a nice length, a little frizzy but that&#x27;s tamable. A HUGE bonus to this is that it came in REALLY early (like 2 weeks early).&lt;br /&gt;As far as heat resistance...well I haven&#x27;t tested that yet, and the color is true to the picture. It was also a lot thicker than I was expecting as well c:&lt;br /&gt;Overall? Loving the wig! c:</li>
    <li> Honestly I haven&#x27;t owned a wig before so maybe I&#x27;m just not comfortable with them.  This wig is heavy and bulky.  The colour is a fun colour but not very natural looking.</li>
    <li> The wig is a very beautiful color I love it I could just stare at the color the whole day. It is a little hard to style and the wig cap a bit small but besides that no complaints. The length of the wig is just right and the curls are beautiful and easy to manage. This is a great wig for cosplay but not so much for everyday.</li>
    <li> Loved this wig! For the price unbeatable. Wore it for Jessica rabbit- looked beautiful and stayed on wo difficulty, not too hot or irritating.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a play, and it was perfect. The hair is soft and manageable, and the color is true to the picture. Just be sure to use the elastic clips in the back and plenty of bobby-pins so it doesn&#x27;t slide of your head mid-dance, as mine did! :D</li>
    <li> But the length isn&#x27;t 32 inches. I kept it because I loved the color. Probably wouldn&#x27;t order again. Thank you</li>
    <li> I love this wig.  It&#x27;s perfect for so many different costumes I have in mind.  I love the fit and the color is perfect.</li>
    <li> i was suprised how good this looked.  good for holloween</li>
    <li> I received this wig in a timely manner, however I was greatly disappointed at how short it is. In the photos, and according to many reviewers, the wig is supposed to be very long. My wig arrived and barely hangs below my shoulders. It&#x27;s also less of a wine color (which I wanted) and more of a bright red. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in the purchase, but not enough to go through the hassle of returning it, since it was such a low cost. My best guess would be that each individual wig is going to vary in length and color, so be leery...wigs may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is soft and curly...I&#x27;ll at least give it a couple stars for that. And while I&#x27;m not happy with the wig, the seller is superb. Shipping was much faster than expected.</li>
    <li> The wig is nice and long and full no problems there.  It wasn&#x27;t quite as curly so once I ran my fingers through it I don&#x27;t know if you could just wear it without it getting tangled so I wore it in a braid.  The only thing I was a little disappointed about what that I wanted it for an Ariel costume and thought it would be bright red like the picture but it&#x27;s burgundy not red.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my Poison Ivy costume this year.  I am so happy with the quality and the fit.  The color is also excellent.  Solid product.</li>
    <li> The photos of this wig showed up a tad desaturated on my screen, but I was very pleased with the color in person. It&#x27;s a dark-ish cherrylike red. The cap is well constructed, has adjustable straps, and the style is really cute.</li>
    <li> Great price for this wig.  The color and style is gorgeous.  It falls so nicely and feels so silky soft.</li>
    <li> I like the way it looks but not so much on me. Im still working out the amount of bangs cut into the wig. But it is a good quality wig.</li>
    <li> Came in earlier then expected not as bright red as the picture tho more burgundy other then that i really like it and great price</li>
    <li> I love this wig! It looks so real, I wear wigs everyday and this is my favorite one! Every guy turns his head. ;)</li>
    <li> It was not the same color in the picture...it was very close to purple. I did not wear it. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> this wig is so great! I bought this for my poison Ivy costume. The picture doesn&#x27;t even do this justice. So worth every single penny! People thought this was my REAL hair. You have to play with it a little bit, but it held up nicely. Even in the rain!</li>
    <li> The quality of the wig was MUCH better than I thought it would be.  It came right out of the package ready to wear.  Sadly, I would give the shipping company ZERO stars.  I ordered it on Sept. 5th, it shipped about a week and a half later.... and I received it 2 MONTHS LATER!  That&#x27;s just not acceptable.  We needed the wig for a play and ordered it a month in advance.  Needless to say, we had to go buy one elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you order this wig and need it quickly, don&#x27;t order from this company but if you&#x27;re not in a hurry, I do recommend the quality.</li>
    <li> It is a really nice quality, the wig cap is large,so if you have a lot of hair to tuck in no problem. It is more burgundy than red though.</li>
    <li> This wig didn&#x27;t look anything like the picture. I was thicker and darker red instead of the strawberry color as shown. Typically thicker is better because you can&#x27;t see the cap, but in this case, I have a small head, meaning that the wig is too full for my head and makes it very noticeable that the hair is not mine. I&#x27;ve since washed it and conditioned it to make it appear less shiny, but my next step is to straighten it with a ceramic straightener on the lowest setting and run through it with thinning shears as this made a world of difference with some of my other wigs, but this is the longest and fullest I have by far. It is adjustable, and it fits around my head so for someone with a more average sized head would look great in this, but I&#x27;m 4&#x27;10 and really small framed so I&#x27;m swimming in it. Once I have the work done on it hopefully I won&#x27;t have old school Texas big hair.</li>
    <li> This wig is gorgeous. It is not quite as curly as it shows in the picture and you have to be careful to style it correctly since there is a ring with not quite enough hair on it that will show if you don&#x27;t arrange the hair right, but the color is beautiful and the hair styles great.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised at the quality of this wig for the price...I love the color it is more wine colored than the photo</li>
    <li> This wig was perfect for a pirate wench. Got lots of looks when grandma walked in the room.  Had the kids not sure about me, but did admit to liking it</li>
    <li> I was hoping to use this wig to dress as Cat Valentine from Nickelodeon&#x27;s Victorious and Sam &amp; Cat for Halloween. I noticed all the good reviews, but honestly this wig doesn&#x27;t work well at all for this purpose. It is a nice color and the curls look nice but the hair is way too thin and small for my head. It is also not very long at all. I was also hoping for it to be straight with curls just on the ends but almost the whole wig is curly. I guess this is what you get for such a cheap price though.</li>
    <li> This is my first wig I think It is beautiful.  Love the color and the length just have to get used to bangs</li>
    <li> I have brown hair and was always curious about what it would be like to have bright red hair...so instead of coloring it, I saw this and decided to give it a try. If I  didn&#x27;t like it I could always wear it for halloween, right?!!....So..it tok a couple weeks to get to me,,,but when I finally received it I was pleasantly surprised. It was very lovely. It is very long and lush with beautiful curls and a beautiful merlot type red..I tested it and wore it out and everyone said the color looked really nice on me...It was a lot of fun to wear too..Not heavy nor hot.It was very comfortable. I buy a lot of hairpieces and wigs and this is definately one of my favorites..and definately the most fun........and lastly the price couldn&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> -better in person&lt;br /&gt;-everyone loved it&lt;br /&gt;-nice full wig&lt;br /&gt;-hair was not coming out (I got some wigs where the hair would really start to fall out)&lt;br /&gt;-would recommend</li>
    <li> I is thin, knotty, and short. You can see the extension part in the back... I probably won&#x27;t order from this place again.</li>
    <li> It looks nothing like the picture, it is way fuller and thicker and looks artificial compared to the picture that looks more realistic. I ordered it 3 weeks before Halloween for my costume and I just got it today. Very disappointed with the delivery time and the product itself.</li>
    <li> The red isn&#x27;t too obnoxious and it had pretty good shipping time. For the price it definitely couldn&#x27;t be beat for my costume in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Such a great price and amazing quality.I was really impressed! I received a ton of compliments. People actually thought it was my real hair.</li>
    <li> Great wig for a great price! It was actually much thicker upon arrival then it looks in the picture and perfect for this Halloween&#x27;s dark Phoenix costume and next years Mystique costume. It took awhile to get here but so worth the wait. I would recommend this company to everyone!</li>
    <li> Now, obviously by the title, I love this wig. It arrived very quickly, and I can&#x27;t believe the price for the quality! I&#x27;m a wig &amp; make up artist and always looking at fun changes, and this wig has it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture: silky smooth, but not so shiny that it isn&#x27;t believable. Easy to comb, easy to style.&lt;br /&gt;Length: As pictured, though since I have such a huge head, a little shorter than in pic,(&#x27;m used to length being shortened to compensate.)&lt;br /&gt;Fullness: Wefted nicely and even after tossing and styling, never a bare spot. Much fuller than I expected for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Size: Adjustable... Now as I mentioned before, I have a huge head \\&quot;23.5\\&quot; to be exact (avg 19-21\\&quot;) and buying a wig off the rack is always a nightmare if not impossible, but for the price I took a chance and glad I did. I have long thick hair and was able to pincurl it nicely and have it STILL fit.&lt;br /&gt;Smell: None. (with synthetic you can sometimes get a horrible smell)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether for cosplay, a photo shoot, stage, night on the town or bedroom, this is a great wig for the price and exceeded all my expectations for a $13 wig!</li>
    <li> Well..first off ill simply say that this is a beautiful wig. But I strongly suggest that you go somewhere else, especially if you&#x27;re considering buying this wig for daily use. I&#x27;m a stay at home mom and the job entitles raising kids and keeping the house clean amongst other things. So you can imagine my busy day.&lt;br /&gt;I considering purchasing this wig after reading a review of a woman, someone of similarities to me, stating that she loved this wig and uses it daily even at work. So I thought \\&quot;what the hell\\&quot; and bought it. BI-IG mistake!&lt;br /&gt;First off: the wig is course, rough and damaged. I don&#x27;t know much about wigs so I consulted a woman who has been using wigs for over 30 years and she gave me tips to soften the hair of the wig and give it \\&quot;life\\&quot; I followed her advice to a T and even had a professional stylist trim the damaged ends off. It was still ROUGH!&lt;br /&gt;Seconds off; when I bought this wig I had a b****in time getting it on and parting the bangs so I could see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So PROS:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;rough&lt;br /&gt;Damaged&lt;br /&gt;TOO SMALL&lt;br /&gt; Oh yeah..it&#x27;s too small. I had to cut the cap and add an extended piece of elastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for costumes..but not everyday use</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and in an alright condition. Hair net holds very well so I&#x27;m happy I didn&#x27;t have to purchase that on the side. The curls are a lot tighter than compared to the one in the picture though. It looks as if I have a semi-afro. I&#x27;m currently trying to straighten it as I type this. Overall it is okay for the price but next time I might order from somewhere else.</li>
    <li> Got this item in the mail today. It arrived very quick and was packaged very nicely. The color was amazing, and the curls were wonderful. However, After putting it on, I noticed the bangs started frizzing and tangling up AND the front part INSTANTLY became a MESS! I haven&#x27;t even worn it outside yet. I didn&#x27;t expect the product to be great, considering the cheap price, but at least it could have held out for a few short hours. Wow! Don&#x27;t let the picture FOOL you!!!!</li>
    <li> It came all raggedy and looked nothing like the picture. It was tacky. It came nappy. It was tacky. Really</li>
    <li> Best surprisingly good purchase I&#x27;ve ever made. I was not expecting it to seem so high quality and look so nice. It is VERY long...but I&#x27;d rather have that than it be too short. Just LOVE it.</li>
    <li> awesome wig with an awesome price tag !</li>
    <li> This wig was a big disappointment. The color of the wig was pretty, but every thing else about the wig was awful. It&#x27;s so ugly I can&#x27;t wear it. I almost puked when I seen the wig. It&#x27;s so fake and Shiny, and it&#x27;s not curly, it&#x27;s big waves.  I don&#x27;t reccomend this wig at all.</li>
    <li> Although this wig is a lot curlier (I wanted it to be curly- but the bang area is just as curly so it gets annoying if you don&#x27;t pin them to the side) and a tad darker in color and shorter (likely because of the tight curls) than shown in the picture, it is quite close and works for my purposes. It arrived in the crazy fast time of three days, and is soft and shiny- but not shiny enough to look fake. The curls are holding well. 5/5!&lt;br /&gt;--EDIT-- Dang these curls hold very well. They are still the same beautiful curls but tangle a bit.</li>
    <li> The wig is a nice wig for the price I bought it at, but is not quite what I expected. I bought this wig for an Ariel cosplay, and I feel like the color is a deeper magenta red rather than what is shown in the first picture. It is darker like similar to the others but maybe a shade more. It is also curlier than the picture shows and the bangs do not fall like the pictures at all. The bangs aren&#x27;t even cut short like the picture makes me assume, so it was hard to even find where the front of the wig was when I first got it. It did come with a hairnet thing (I wouldn&#x27;t think of it as a hairnet, but that&#x27;s what its purpose is). The wig overall was just different than I expected. Still a good quality, but nothing like I imagined it would look from the pictures. It think it would make a great Poison Ivy wig, but not Ariel.</li>
    <li> I have been waiting forever to get this wig! So happy when it came in today, much earlier than expected, it wasn&#x27;t due to be here until Nov 22. The pictures say USA Seller, but the package shipped from China? I don&#x27;t care where it came from its great! A little long and definately must do something with the bangs! It&#x27;s great and you cant see the netting through the hair, looks a little fake but I still plan to wear it everyday/ mostly everyday.</li>
    <li> Loved the wig. Neat, soft, clean. I&#x27;m very happy with it. Will bye from them again. The price is affordable.</li>
    <li> A great wig, I got so many compliments on it as part of my costume but thinking I will wear this every now and then just because.</li>
    <li> Not as long as the picture portrays but it is a nice wig.  I ended up dying my actual hair a similar color (less violet).  That was so much maintenance so I did an ombre style with pink and purple at the ends, but I can still use this when I wanna channel my inner mermaid.</li>
    <li> Came in 3 days!!!&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited and omg.&lt;br /&gt;Its BEAUTIFUL.&lt;br /&gt;Came with a snug wig cap.&lt;br /&gt;No gaps or bare spots.&lt;br /&gt;Long and SUPER amazing curls.&lt;br /&gt;I dont want to take it off haha.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely buying from this seller again.</li>
    <li> The wig isn&#x27;t as long as advertised and it&#x27;s also bright red not the darker red in the picture. It also has a strong smell that makes my eyes water so I never want to wear it because of that.</li>
    <li> This came quickly (approx, 12 days). The quality was much better than what you would get at a costume shop, but it certainly wouldn&#x27;t pass as real hair. I also had to cut it quite a bit to make it look ok. I wore it twice and then trashed it because it got so ratty and tangled. If you need this for a costume, it is perfect. If you are buying it as a regular wig, I would find something else.</li>
    <li> Wow, I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase I seriously thought I was gonna get some cheap wig, but was perfect for halloween comfy , stays on all night, fair price and might even use it for another occasion !!</li>
    <li> the wig is as curly as it looks on the pig but the color in person is so much more brighter than this. more like neon red which is what i didn&#x27;t like uch because i thought it was actual red wine :/</li>
    <li> As the review title suggests, you should *not* assume that this wig will be any darker or lighter than it is in the topmost image on this page. I wouldn&#x27;t trust some of the customer images. It is exactly the color you see on this page, and any differences in the customer pictures are the result of circumstantial lighting differences. In &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; lighting it&#x27;s a... I guess *medium* red? Half-way between an Ariel/Rihanna color and a dark brown red. I expected a darker shade, but overall it&#x27;s still a good quality wig and it was delivered quickly. :)</li>
    <li> Very good quality for synthetic hair. An excellent purchase at an extremely low price and came very quickly in the mail!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how long the wig was when I bought it, But I love it and It came fast!</li>
    <li> It tangles easily but I love this wig and I love the color. It makes me itchy but so does every other wig I own. Overall glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> This wig was horrible, it only lasted a day before it tangled up so much you couldnt brush it. If you&#x27;re looking for heat resistant this is not it. it shrivled up my wig. the price is cheap but its crappy</li>
    <li> This was my first ever wig purchase. I&#x27;ve had thinning hair for several years now as a result of the medications I have to take daily for a chronic condition. I was so tired of looking for a wig online at your typical wig stores. All their wigs looked like something an old lady would wear and I&#x27;d just about given up on finding one even remotely close to my own color and style. This is the same color that I normally dye my hair and I&#x27;ve always kept it long and curly as well. At 41, I wasn&#x27;t prepared to loose enough hair to resort to a wig but, I am so glad I learned about Cosplay wigs. They are more modern in style for one and the quality is amazing. I&#x27;m not sure if thats the case with all Cosplay wigs but, it was with this particular one. In addition, I could never afford what most of those grandma wigs cost anyway. So this wig definitely met all my needs. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars was the bangs are a little hard to style as they just all come forward. When I try to part them, they don&#x27;t stay parted but, it could be I have no clue what I&#x27;m doing too. Will definitely be looking to purchase more wigs from this seller in the future. Maybe even get a bit daring and try some different styles.</li>
    <li> Its not as long as the photo</li>
    <li> Looks just like the picture though not made for a larger head.  My daughter loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to brush with wide toothed comb not too much shedding just be gentle.</li>
    <li> My sub trashed it out first use, but it arrived Quick &amp; was of use. I would buy one again for this purpose.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing wig. It feels so real and looks real. I bought it for Halloween, but I like to wear it every once in a while for fun!</li>
    <li> I love the product, it actually feels more plastic that what was announce, but for the price is a good deal and it still looks great. Love it!</li>
    <li> Sad to say I am very unhappy with my purchase with this wig you can see the cap and the crown shows a big spot That holds the hair it does not look anything like the picture</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig from two different stores and both are exactly the same. As a drag queen I stack wigs and these were perfect.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I can&#x27;t really complain about this wig so much since it was pretty cheap. I&#x27;ll keep this review as simple as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Arrived three weeks earlier than the actual estimated date.&lt;br /&gt;Great shade of color. Not exactly true to the picture, a little darker, but still red. Looks natural, and I like it.&lt;br /&gt;Curls are absolutely fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;Fits fine even for a person who has very thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Smelled at first.&lt;br /&gt;Non-heat resistant for people who likes to style wig. I tested out a strand of curl and tried straightening it and it burned a bit, and the curl was not the same after I washed it and let it dry.&lt;br /&gt;Wig cap was flimsy, so I used my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would definitely not mind ordering from Taobaopit again. Of course other customers probably had a different experience from me. So don&#x27;t let my review stop you from ordering the wig.</li>
    <li> Very nice wig! As expected from a wig set at this price, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting so many curls! In the end it&#x27;s still a nice wig!</li>
    <li> Satisfied with the product. Very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I had previously ordered another wig (from another company) that was supposed to be a darker red, but ended up more orange-red like The Little Mermaid.  I was nervous ordering online because there are so many different shades of red and I needed a darker / burgundy one, but the color on this one turned out great.  The only downside is that the part is more in the middle and not as flattering of a part as in the picture.  But with a little styling, it&#x27;ll turn out great!</li>
    <li> I got this for a phoenix costume. The color is a tiny bit on the purple side of red, not quite what is shown, but the wig is a good quality and the curls have such a nice bounce to them. If you have a wider face, this might not look so awesome on you as the bangs won&#x27;t lay quite right.</li>
    <li> I just got this product and it is so great and it looks so real and feels so soft. I was debating if I should bleach my hair red I didn&#x27;t want to cause of how bad it damages your hair so I thought I should try this and its great and looks natural and even better I don&#x27;t have to damage my hair if I could I would rate a 10+</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying I LIKE this wig but I don&#x27;t love it. The color is true to the picture and the length is beautiful. I just didn&#x27;t like that I had to trim the bangs cause one side was longer than the other. Another no no is that it&#x27;s too shiny. Shiny is so not realistic, and it tangles up quite easily but overall I like it. I might wear it out I might not.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very pretty wig, works well with the costume I bought it for, and the color appears more purple in some light and more red in others, this isn&#x27;t too much of a problem just takes away from the character a little bit. The wig is thick and bouncy in the front, I had and am still having some trouble getting it to stay out of my face and look nice at the same time, having hair slip into my eye hurts a bit. Overall, I like the wig, it was a great price and others have told me through a couple Facebook images, that they thought I dyed my hair. I hope it can withstand the abuse it&#x27;s going to be put into next month. :)</li>
    <li> I am a cosplayer who buys many wigs from many places. This wig is unbelievable for this price point. Very soft and full. The color is true as well. Extremely impressed.</li>
    <li> it is the right color but it feels fake and I cant have that. I could wear it around the house or on Halloween but not to work!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the MOST beautiful and silk wig i ever had in myhands,and the red colro is just DIVINE,i loved it so so much,.</li>
    <li> Great wig. The color is very bright and eye catching and it is very comfortable to wear. Needs a bit of care though.</li>
    <li> It looks like a blind 5 year old gave her a haircut. The hair is IMPOSSIBLE to move around into place and it&#x27;s just hard to get around. The cut is even worse. It&#x27;s so choppy, and the layers are all random. This wig just sucks.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s just like the picture and is so soft and almost real feeling. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. I will be buying from this company again for my cosplay needs for sure</li>
    <li> Arrived fast however looked different than the picture, It had tighter curls so it was shorter and it was a brighter red. Overall though it was very pretty and I received many compliments while cosplaying both X-&lt;br /&gt;Men&#x27;s Jean Gray &amp;#34;Phoenix&amp;#34; and also Jessica Rabbit.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality wig.  I got exactly what I hoped it would look like.  I was worried at that price it would not be very good but it was.</li>
    <li> This product was thin compared to most of the wigs I have bought. Where the bangs meet the rest of the wig at the top the mesh would bled through. I found a way to work around that but please try not to let that happen again. I won&#x27;t be buying anything from this company again.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve had this for about a week and a half and after a few days of wear it became very tangled (like MASSIVE knots that I couldn&#x27;t get out without tearing at the hair) and in just a few days I&#x27;ve pulled out huge amounts of hair. The tracks also show a bit in the bangs. i wish i had bought another wig</li>
    <li> my first wid soooo excited right? well I dont know if it was me or what but I did not like it. it was flat way to small for my head and I wound up cutting it like a weave and gluing it in my hair!!! I also had to add conditioner and such to get the bounce and shine. even though i hate it in one piece after prepping it myself which i shouldnt have to do i actually like it and have got alot of comments about it</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS ITEM PERFECT LOOKING FOWARD TO BUY MORE STUFF THE COLOR IS PERFECT AND FOR A VERY CHEAP PRICE !!!!</li>
    <li> For how little I paid for it and how quickly arrived, I am very pleased with this wig. I&#x27;ve paid more for junky Halloween party store wigs that look like they&#x27;re made of straw and shed immediately. This is NOT one of those wigs. The color is beautiful, it has a nice shine, and the coverage is good.  I wore this outdoors for two hours and it didn&#x27;t get snarled up. I&#x27;m thinking about buying another in a different color.</li>
    <li> Perfect red looks bright and cheery.  My forehead is pretty small so I cut side sweep bangs.  Most amazing wig I have bought.  Looks real.  Worth the price. need to wear headband to cover top to make it appear real but no one knows it is a wig and headband makes it look cute.  :)</li>
    <li> I have never bought anything like a wig online but I have to say, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t seem at all fake, color is slightly darker than pictured and feels very soft.&lt;br /&gt;It does have curls and can be fingered through or brushed to get desired look.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants a cute costume wig or everyday wig!</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig for a Poison Ivy cosplay, as I used to use my natural hair but recently cut it all off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig arrived two weeks before the expected delivery date, which was WONDERFUL. It was in perfect shape when I opened it up, and was really pleased by the softness and overall quality of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the color of the wig I received is MUCH darker and purpler than the pictured shade - honestly it&#x27;s bordering on maroon. It&#x27;s a pretty color, but not what I was expecting, it&#x27;s definitely much more of a dark red wine shade. I&#x27;m concerned about how well it will go over as a Poison Ivy wig, so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for buy something different!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all that being said, I LOVE this wig. It&#x27;s so soft and pretty, and the color is GORGEOUS even though it&#x27;s not what I wanted. The quality more than makes up for the color disparity, and since the price was so good I&#x27;ll be keeping it anyways, and wearing it for Halloween at the very least. The one star off is just for the color - in every other aspect this is a five star wig!</li>
    <li> While I made the mistake of not reading the &amp;#34;wine&amp;#34; part in &amp;#34;wine red,&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t even mind, because this wig is absolutely gorgeous. It&#x27;s the best wig I&#x27;ve ever bought quality wise, and it&#x27;s also the cheapest! I adore it and think it&#x27;s wonderful for cosplaying!! Thank you so much, and I didn&#x27;t mind waiting, because it was worth it!</li>
    <li> this wig was very good got here fast and also just amazing fit  everbody loves it. it very  full and the red is just amazing to too buy it</li>
    <li> This wig arrived in 7 business days despite its month-long expected delivery date. The wig is very full; there are no spots where the wig cap shows through. The color is a bit darker than pictured- it is more wine colored than the bright red that is shown. It is very soft and the curls are very nice. It is a little shiny, but not super shiny. The bangs are a bit long, so I will probably cut them, but they swoop to the side nicely as well. I am very happy with this wig, it is worth a lot more than it is priced for. It really is a beautiful wig.</li>
    <li> I pay for two shipping but it didn&#x27;t come in two days which is clearly Amazons issue seeing as it&#x27;s a perk of Prime membership.. Onto the wig itself. The color is as pictured its kind of like The Little Mermaid&#x27;s color. It&#x27;s very soft and not too shiny. Under the wig is nude which is very nice for those of us who do not have a dark complexion. However the wig is very thin!! It is so thin that you can see clearly that it is a wig. Regardless of which way you move the bangs you can see weaving. If your wearing a headband it&#x27;s not so noticeable. I ordered two different wigs from the same company and I hope they are not the same quality. So for the price I guess it wasn&#x27;t to bad.</li>
    <li> the wig is as described; i like it!&lt;br /&gt;its very nice; best wig i own--most wigs i have irritate my eyes when the hair goes over them but these did not.&lt;br /&gt;my sibling and i like the color of the wig as well.</li>
    <li> i ordered this to go with a Mystique costume for Halloween and it was perfect. nice color and didn&#x27;t tangle or shed too much. It does take a while to arrive so as long as you plan for that then this is totally a great buy. I ordered a purple one for a friend as well and she loved it. This is not a natural looking red but it is very beautiful, good quality wig.</li>
    <li> The elastic stretched out after 3 wears so I could only wear it a couple of times. It was cheap though, so I guess it wasn&#x27;t a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this wig.  I didn&#x27;t expect it to look like the photo, but it looks awful.  When on my head, you can see a rubbery like disc at the crown of the wig on the top very clearly even though it is supposed to be under all the hair.  It is not wearable at all.  Also, there is not &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; size listed on this wig and it fits too tight to the point of giving me a headache.  I tried it out for hours to see if I could make it look presentable.  Unfortunately, I wil not be wearing this wig.  I would have returned it, but I decided to give it to someone else instead.</li>
    <li> looks gorgeous with my poison ivy costume!  Mine can be brushed gently to look fuller and fluffier than in the picture.  Fits well.</li>
    <li> Soft and long. Probably one of the best wigs I have ever bought.</li>
    <li> Love the wig and everyone else loved it too.  I have a few and this one was great quality.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> I purchased this wig for a Cosplay I am doing in April. The color of the wig is beautiful and the amount of hair that is actually apart of the wig is astounding for the price. It is gorgeous. However, the Cosplay I am doing requires lose long waves, and a long side bang just like the picture. What I received was a beautiful wig, however the curls are tighter and two put together and there is no long side bang. The wig is beautiful and I am wondering if it is just what happens when so many are being made. I think I can brush them out and potentially get some of the bang to the side. For the price, you can not beat it. It is a beautiful wig either way. However, be warned, if what you want is exactly like what is shown in the picture, you maybe a but disappointed.</li>
    <li> My own family didn&#x27;t recognize me! I purchased this as part of a costume, but it is really lovely. Soft, manageable curls. The color is even prettier in person. For such a reasonable price, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> is was and is still very soft the cap was very soft l like it color ,the color was just like the picture.</li>
    <li> I just bought it and so far I am very happy with it. I really love the way this looks and feels! It photographs really well and you can&#x27;t beat the price. It also arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> terrible...the color was WAY off and it was a lot shorter and it looked like a cheapo thin wig. not worth it at all. was extremely disappointed because I read so many great reviews.I returned this very quickly.</li>
    <li> Got in the time they said it would get here perfect color really satisfied</li>
    <li> This took about two weeks to come in but it was from Hong Kong so that&#x27;s understandable!  The wig is actually very nice and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Best advice is to really play around with the wig and find a way to style the bangs because they tend to just be in your face if you don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful wig, got it for a wig and wine party and it worked great!!</li>
    <li> Received this wig for which I ordered 2 and was pleasantly surprised in the quality and texture.  I purchased this wig to add variety to my wig stock for theatrical productions that I style for.  I was a little hesitant because of the low price, but figured what did I have to lose for under $10.  (most of the productions that I work on have very low hair and makeup budgets, so I try to cut my overhead).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wig is built very nicely with hair sewn onto a full wig cap.  (also come with a free wig cap).  The color is true to image, soft and luxurious.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely order more in a variety of colors to have in my stock.  This is a great cosplay wig, theatrical wig better than costume store quality wig.  Definitely would recommend purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s Go Ya&#x27;ll!!!!!™</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s great! Soft very cool wig for halloween costumes. Not like the cheapo party store ones. These are nice. However not quite as long as I had imagined it to be.</li>
    <li> Great wig - will be perfect for my Poison Ivy costume.  It looks great on and the hair is soft and flowy and I LOVE the color.  It comes with a net to put your hair up in too, which is great.  Great wig, especially for price.  Only thing is, if you order this, order it WAY in advance of when you will need it.  Most items ordered on Amazon are delivered promptly, however this one is coming from Asia; I ordered it in mid September, it shipped on September 18 and I just now received it on October 15, so it took about a MONTH to get delivered.  So, it is a great wig at a great price, but if you need something quickly, don&#x27;t go for this one.</li>
    <li> Came here earlier than expected, is a tad bit darker than pictured, very soft, good quality. My only complaint is the bangs are very full and heavy. Will need to cut them significantly. Overall happy and a good purchase for cheap.</li>
    <li> Bought this for halloween. It was pretty enough to wear out too.  I love it and I got so many compliments on my new hair!</li>
    <li> This is for a child&#x27;s head.</li>
    <li> The wig&#x27;s color is fantastic, however, unlike the adv image the wig itself is too bulky. It is very obvious that it is not a real hair. Would only recommend it for a costume or Halloween thing but not for regular use!</li>
    <li> fit great a little longer then I wanted buy cut it myself and love it</li>
    <li> Worn this wig several times.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I use this wig for photo shoots and it&#x27;s one of everyone&#x27;s favorites.  It comes styled exactly like the photo shows and I haven&#x27;t had to re-style it even after using it a number of times.  It&#x27;s very full, I haven&#x27;t seen any gaps in the hair in any of the photos I&#x27;ve taken.  If it came in different colors, I would order more!  I&#x27;ve bought from this seller multiple times and have never been disappointed.</li>
    <li> This wing is awesome I love it. It looks just like the picture. I am very happy with this wig. Would buy again. Wish there were other colors</li>
    <li> Purchased to use for Halloween.  Color is great!</li>
    <li> Happy with my new wig. Got it before the date it was supposed to be delivered. Waiting for the right time to use it with my husband.</li>
    <li> no no no. Not unless you are playing a tacky prostitute in a movie.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with this wig and the seller. :) It is really inexpensive for one of this quality and will go great for my Aradia Sprite cosplay, it came with a wig cap and a really pretty ring (I did not know I was going to get a wig as well, this was a very pleasant suprise.) All of the wigs I have ordered from previous suppliers based in china have always taken more than a month to arrive but this got to me in only a couple of weeks. :) Will  be buying from again if I ever need more wigs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this wig, the color is wonderful and it feels so soft, fits great and it&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t look like the picture. It was longer than I thought which I liked. I loved the color but it sheds sooooooo much😩. It get tangled real quick.</li>
    <li> the wig came in nearly two weeks before the date specified which was a surprise! its a bit longer than i thought it&#x27;d be (nearly to my hips!) and the bang reach my nose but i just swipe them to the side and pin them back while im working. the curls are beautiful and even with me tying them back countless times, they still keep their shape relatively well. i haven&#x27;t washed it yet (i need to though haha!) so i can&#x27;t say how the curls and the wig itself holds up after it gets wet but even if the curls fall out, it&#x27;d be a gorgeous wig. i keep my natural hair at a buzz since i cant deal with long hair all the time (especially while im asleep!) so i bought this wig as my first \\&quot;daily\\&quot; wig and it does the trick! extremely comfortable and the colour is subtle enough for a job but vibrant enough to stand out. it came with a netted wig cap and two hair pin loop things (to do complicated twists and buns with) and the wig was in perfect condition when i opened it. im definitely going to be buying alot more from this seller!</li>
    <li> Bought this for the Kids on Halloween. They liked it and got a laugh</li>
    <li> First of all, the color of this wig is quite a bit darker color of red then it shows in the picture. I personally love the actual color. For it being $14 its really not that bad. I did have to trim the bangs a little, but the curls stay wonderfully. To the feel, you can definitely tell its fake hair. And after wearing it for about an hour the hair tends to frizz a little. Over all though, for the price, it really is a nice wig.</li>
    <li> Really like the wig its great color very soft but it is very small. It fits my 3 yr old perfect but my head not so much. But I can make it work for one Halloween party.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this wig for a Halloween costume. Being the first wig that I have purchased I was nervous of the quality. This wig looks amazing the color is a little bit darker and a tad bit long and long bangs but easily fixable with pins and brushes just like normal hair . It was delivered way before the delivery date. I&#x27;m excited and can&#x27;t wait to show off my wig for Halloween at such an awesome price.</li>
    <li> The wig feels really good for the price. It did take about a month for me to receive which I was not expecting. The wig is good quality but the color is not what is pictured. I got this for a costume bc in the picture it&#x27;s a bright red. The wig I received is more Brown with a hint of red, the color is not what I expected.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig because it had the same photo as another wig I bought last year that I was really impressed with. This wig was more or less a cheap knockoff of that. Half of the sizing tracks were sewn shut, so I couldn&#x27;t adjust the wig at all. The cap netting was fraying and falling apart when I opened it on two separate wigs. Worst of all, the netting was clearly and obviously visible through the hair at the front and back. The only way I was able to wear this wig was with a hat on, and it fell apart after 4 hours of wearing. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Wig was for Halloween. It was good, not great but definitely better than other wigs I&#x27;ve used! The color was true to the picture.</li>
    <li> I love diz wig so silky. I usually dnt buy any things like diz cuz im afraid of wat im gonna get bt really nice just one thing I dnt know how to put it on ........need practices;).... bt my hubby loved it ....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not nearly as long as it looks in the picture and I was disapointed because it&#x27;s smaller then what was listed on the size of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I bought this for a one time picture and I did manage to balance it on my head enough in the front to take a good picture but it won&#x27;t go over my head.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
    <li> Looks slightly different from pic but still looks nice sheds a lil much but only needs it for a few wears anyways so good buy for the price wld recommend it</li>
    <li> Received the product yesterday, though it said I would get it tomorrow! Hurray! It is definitely not a natural looking red, but it&#x27;s very soft and bouncy! Overall nice fit and came with a cap. Good for a Jessica Rabbit or Ariel sort of look, not everyday.</li>
    <li> It you want to have long red, sexy hair for an event, this wig is for you! I felt like the little mermaid or a sexy siren in this wig. It is well made and a good deal for the price. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> The shipping was only a couple days which was awesome! it came with this really nice wig cap. the color is a little more red then in the picture but thats ok i still love it. it sheds very little but is a little tight on my head. its also very very soft.&lt;br /&gt;i recommend this product for anyone who needs a red wig.</li>
    <li> I had a lot of fun playing with this wig and I would consider ordering again. It is exactly how it looks.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the price. I needed a wig for a Poison Ivy for costume for Halloween. The wig is really soft and holds the style well. It was fairly comfortable to wear all night, too. I highly recommend it :)</li>
    <li> I just got my wig today and it came right on time . I love the feel of the hair feels like your own hair came in the same color just like in the photo. I will be buying more from this company.</li>
    <li> I love this wig. The color is as stated/expected. The quality is much more than I was expecting for the price! I can wear this out and it looks and feels like real hair. Shipped within stated timeframe</li>
    <li> Really happy with the quality of the wig specially considering the price! The bangs were a lot longer than I expected. They were completely un-styled and reached past my chin. It was an easy fix for me but it&#x27;s something to be aware of for those of you looking to purchase :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s absolutely beautiful</li>
    <li> Great wig for a great price! Color looks as pictured and very smooth, not tangly like cheaper wigs. Order with lots of time, though. I ordered it about a month before Halloween and it didn&#x27;t come in time, but it wasn&#x27;t estimated to come until after. Too bad. I found a cheap version that worked well, but this would have been perfect! Happy to have it in my collection anyway.</li>
    <li> Colour is spot on, and so was the style - at first. It took a very short amount of time, with very little wear, to become a bit wonky. The curls straightened out a bit and the original part in the wig has been lost. It&#x27;s still good enough to be used, I just wished it would have stayed as it came a bit longer.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to where with my little mermaid costume and it was beyond what I had imagined. I had fast shipping and the wig is excellent quality. even came with a wig cap. I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife to dress up her mannequin head and she loves it!  It is very realistic looking. Just a great product!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The wig I received is much shorter and darker in color.  The hair is parted in the middle with long bangs. I needed it for a Princess Ariel costume, but the one I received looks more like the princess from Brave.</li>
    <li> I can not tell you how perfect this wig is! The curls stay in place and everything I never had such a great wig. I want to color my hair this color to the color is perfect</li>
    <li> This wig is seriously hot! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would upload an image of me in it, but I don&#x27;t know how. Does anyone know how?</li>
    <li> This wig is very poorly made and it was entirely too tight, i ended up throwing it in the bushes half way through the night. It was never seen from again....</li>
    <li> I needed a long curly wig for a cosplay I&#x27;m doing and this was perfect! It fits nice and securely without being tight and the hair itself is luxuriously soft and shiny, without looking cheap or fake. Like others have said, it comes with a wig cap too! I would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also got here SUPER FAST. I live on the complete opposite side of the country, and I received it in 4 days! Lots of other wigs were supposedly going to take several weeks to get here, and I was crunched for time, so that was awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Fits great without shifting&lt;br /&gt;Shipped super fast&lt;br /&gt;Hair feels/looks natural&lt;br /&gt;Included wig net&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None! :D</li>
    <li> I ordered this same wig before, but this one wasn&#x27;t the same as the one I&#x27;d previously received.  However, I loved this one MORE.  it&#x27;s my new favorite!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a cosplay and it is exactly what I wanted. I was hesitant and purchasing this because i didn&#x27;t think it would work well with my skin tone but no worries. It looks great!</li>
    <li> This wig is not the one shown in the picture. it puffs out way more than i had expected and i had trouble getting it on. also, it was very poorly packaged in a plastic bag. but since i bought this for a crazy hair day contest, i will keep it. it is not very evenly cut, but arrived in two days:) its okay, but i don&#x27;t think i will have much use for it after that.</li>
    <li> I bought this and have used it twice. It looks great! I brushed it and stored it to use again.</li>
    <li> Got it just four days after purchase date and it came very nicely packaged. The color is just as pictured and the texture is great! It is super soft. I purchased this as a gift for my sister who had head surgery and they had to shave her head. I would definitely order from this seller again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s much curlier than it looks. The back of the wig is thick and full but the front top came in spotty and I can definitely see the tan cap beneath where chunks of hair are missing or too thin. The hair itself isn&#x27;t a bad quality, but it&#x27;s not the greatest I&#x27;ve ever worn. I can somewhat tame it with my fingers and untangle it moderately easily without a comb. For low light situations it&#x27;s perfect. For anything with really good lighting and close ups... search for something more quality and spend the money on a better wig. This is okay and a good price for what I needed now, since I&#x27;m in a rush, but in the future I plan on looking for something more permanent and refined for my growing collection of cosplay wigs.</li>
    <li> I would&#x27;ve preferred the color in the photo, but this wig is more pink in color.  It also slides off easily.  Otherwise it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
    <li> Took quite some time to get her, but it was worth the wait. It is a very nice wig and the picture doesn&#x27;t do the actual color justice. I really dig this wig!</li>
    <li> I have a friend who loves wigs.  I know what you&#x27;re thinking...her hair is gross- untrue! It&#x27;s beautiful, but when we all get together the wigs seem to always come out.  So, long story short, I buy her wigs for gifts.  She especially loved this one.  it&#x27;s long and it&#x27;s of high quality.  You&#x27;ll like this one.</li>
    <li> For less than $10, I was prepared for a cheap looking nightmare, but was pleasantly surprised with how nicely made this wig actually is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The color is a beautiful deep red&lt;br /&gt;Feels so soft &amp; curls/ waves stay nicely shaped right out of the package&lt;br /&gt;Included is a free hair net that isn&#x27;t just a cheap lunch-lady quality net&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;For those of us inexperienced wig-wearers, instructions on how to fix it to the cap would be great, along with styling tips/care instructions.</li>
    <li> Fits perfect ! came perfectly packed well and arrived just on time like it said ... this is my first time buying a wig very happy with it .</li>
    <li> THIS WIG IS ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS OKAY. I LOVE IT. IT MAKES ME FEEL SO PRETTY! ^.^ THE CURLS ARE MUCH FULLER &amp; BOUNCIER IRL.</li>
    <li> Just as the ad says, it is charming, long, wavy, and wine red (don&#x27;t think natural red). Its really cute and fun for a party or outing. Liked it and got quite a few good comments about it.</li>
    <li> I love the color and how beautiful it was made.. will be buying more of this style! By the way gotten many complement&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I love this wig!! I damaged the last one in a door accedent but its pretty durable.  It flows like real and it gets compliments.  So I bought another one ^^ highly recomend if you&#x27;re on a tight budget yet still want a good product.</li>
    <li> I wear this wig almost every day, it is very comfortable. and it&#x27;s super cute in a braid to the side. it does tangle up a bit but that&#x27;s easy to fix with a comb. a few hairs come out every once in a while, I had to cut the bangs to suit my face too. overall i will buy again :)</li>
    <li> Great quality. Beautiful wig. Way better than even expected. Fast shipping. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Literally the best wig I&#x27;ve had so far!! It looked so natural and is a beautiful shade of red! Exceeded my expectations I will definitely be a repeat customer because I&#x27;ve tried others and none compare to what this company has to offer.</li>
    <li> I thought it was nice quality at a great price. I used it for Halloween and it looked great. My only problem is that it is thick and doesn&#x27;t seem to have a natural part as shown in picture. It&#x27;s no big deal I just wore a clip on the side, but if I didn&#x27;t I think it would cover my whole face. It&#x27;s not a big deal, so I still gave 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Great wig! It arrived about 2 weeks ahead of the shipping estimate. The color, curls, and cut were exactly like the photo. The curls even lasted through me brushing the wig with a wig brush, and I got a lot of compliments. Great product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig for a Poison Ivy costume. Not only did it arrive well before its projected delivery date, it was perfect for my costume.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit darker than it looks in the picture, but it still worked perfectly for my costume.&lt;br /&gt;It is a rarity--a good-quality wig for a really great price.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely order this again. And I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and I love it, so i know she will to</li>
    <li> First off let&#x27;s talk shipping. Coming from China there&#x27;s a long wait estimated which is scary when you have a deadline; however my wig got here 2 weeks before the delivery estimate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the wig. It falls mid back, the color is fairly true to the image. The curl is mainly a loose wave with a few tighter sections that have loosened well with some combining. The quality far surpasses many wigs twice the cost.</li>
    <li> Beautiful  curl and nice deep wine color! Very satisfied with this product. I see mopre purchases in the future (:</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had crappier wigs from a party store that were twice as expensive - this wasn&#x27;t super shiny and cheap looking, and the curls held well throughout the night. Solid buy!</li>
    <li> Was quite surprised at the quality of this wig for the price paid!  The colour was spot on and with just the right amount of curl (didn&#x27;t need any styling other than a barrette) and was nice and thick.  Very impressed and would most definitely buy from this company again!</li>
    <li> Great quality! It was exactly what the details explained. Can&#x27;t wait to order some more in different colors. Thank you!</li>
    <li> so I bought this wig for A Mannequin that in my Aunt&#x27;s Store window display because the old one was let&#x27;s just say Played out but any ways the color was the same as shown in the picture one thing i will say is that the wig&#x27;s hair could have been a little bit more curly like the one in the picture oh yeah and the bangs long as hell but i am 100% happy with my purchase i hope that i was some help to you....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;xoxoxo</li>
    <li> Bad quality. Bad color. Bad cut. Hair falls out. pretty in the picture, not so much in person. I wouldn&#x27;t even call it red.</li>
    <li> realy love this wig,feels very comfortable and is very good quality for a price.....and the color looks more pretty when u put on ur hair...</li>
    <li> Very nice quality, perfect curls are easy to detangle with my own fingers and bring back the bounce in the curls. Very nice colour. Only downfalls if I had to pick, it&#x27;s not as long as pictured, and it&#x27;s a tiny bit small, so you might have to really bind your hair for it to not slide off</li>
    <li> It does not fit my giant face. Warning to those with a huge face: run away and don&#x27;t look back.</li>
    <li> Good quality wig, much better than expected. You can adjust the size on it, even. It shipped really, really fast. I got it in slightly over a week. The other reviews said how fast the shipping was, so I took the chance that I might get it before Halloween, even though the delivery estimate said December. I got it in time and was very happy with it.</li>
    <li> The wig took forever to get here of course! One side was curly other was flat but all around good full wig</li>
    <li> First time wearing it, trying it on none the less and its tangled and poofy. Looks nothing like the picture after you wear it. It&#x27;s beautiful out of the package and then just frizzes up and washing it does not fix it.this is strictly a one time use for halloween or something.</li>
    <li> Oh, my hubby just absolutely loves this wig on me! I will definitely purchase again, and yeah I would recommend this wig. It is very sexy and really gives you  a total makeover.</li>
    <li> Very soft and well made.</li>
    <li> This product seems to be good for someone using it as a one time costume idea but does not look realistic at all and knots very easily. Half an hour after trying it on it started to frizz and knot up in the back very badly. I have tried to comb the knots out but the hair just falls out. Overall I would not recommend</li>
    <li> I really love this wig the color is vibrant and it fits my head very good I get alot of compliments on my wig!! Okay reviw I have been wearing this wig none stop and lets just say everyone loves this wig I get ALOT OF COMPLIMENTS on this wig if you like a little vibrant colors and wine red colors I definitely recommend this wig to you!!!</li>
    <li> Wig is not full. Very poor quality.</li>
    <li> Not the right color. Kind of big, &amp; hard to keep on. Wish I would have gotten what was in the pic. It&#x27;s more of a pinkish orange.</li>
    <li> The wig I received wasn&#x27;t at all like the product advertised. It was very poorly made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. My wig is much curlier, which would contribute to the next problem:&lt;br /&gt;2. My wig is much shorter, just barely touching my shoulders. It isn&#x27;t at all like the photo or the length listed.&lt;br /&gt;3. My wig was smaller and fit on very tight, it felt like the wig was intended to be more for a child. I&#x27;ve bought many wigs and never had an issue like this so it isn&#x27;t as though I have a larger-than-average sized head.&lt;br /&gt;4. The netting on my wig is strange. It seems like it was just made poorly. The top has an odd bump that you can really feel and see even when the wig is on. The only way to cover this is if you wear a hat.&lt;br /&gt;5. If you&#x27;re not careful you could easily see the netting through the wig, once again you&#x27;ll need a hat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side the wig came faster than expected. I placed my order on March 15th. The estimated time was April 9-25, but I received it on April 5th. It came nicely packaged with a free wig cap. The colour is very pretty but not like in the picture used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall there was pretty much... everything wrong with the wig I received. I don&#x27;t have high expectations so the wig I did get wasn&#x27;t terrible and I like it if worn a certain way however if it was properly advertised as that wig I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought it. The only thing the wig advertised and the wig I received have in common is the wine-red colouring but even so mine is darker. The colour is gorgeous but sadly that does not make up for everything else. It will be good for a funny dress-up time but my intention was to wear it out and I won&#x27;t be able to do that comfortably with this. Really sad because in the customer submitted photos it looks like everyone else got such nice, long, full wigs but I got left with something that is hardly wearable.</li>
    <li> Wig has great color and curl. Good length. Doesn&#x27;t look horribly fake and shiny like a lot of cheaper wigs. Great for cosplay!</li>
    <li> This wig barely has hair to cover your hair and it&#x27;s not long like the picture shows. The bangs aren&#x27;t there</li>
    <li> This was my first time ever ordering a wig. I should have gone something that gone good with my skin tone or something more real looking. But either way i am happy with it. It helps me for my Anime conventions i go to with my friends. I plan on getting more in the near future. And this time i will be more produtive of what i buy :)</li>
    <li> It has too much hair on the center of the head so anyone can tell is a wig. Also the bangs don&#x27;t fall like in the picture, and the head size is too small. Don&#x27;t buy, it&#x27;s a waste of money, not even for hallowin is cute</li>
    <li> This wig was exactly what I expected from the picture and description.  It&#x27;s a great wig!  Only problem I had with it is that is gets in your face a little but I&#x27;m sure that can be fixed with a couple bobby pins.  Other than that I was extremely happy with it!  And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Really liked this wig, but I went back to order more in the different colors and there all gone?</li>
    <li> As other people have stated, the bangs are very intense and either need to be trimmed or styled. But otherwise, I really like this wig for costumes and cosplays. It&#x27;s color is bright enough to tell it&#x27;s definitely a wig, you will never be able to pass it off as real hair that&#x27;s just colored bright.</li>
    <li> It looks fake on me....</li>
    <li> GORGEOUS wig. Absolutely stunning. Wonderful color and it&#x27;s really soft. The ONLY reasons I did not give it a full 5 stars is because the cap is a little small and the tabs that are there to help you adjust it on your head seem to be either really small or absent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Def recommend though!</li>
    <li> This wig was, and is amazing! It was everything I expected it to be, though it was pretty matted in the underlayers. (I was able to fix this, but it was a little annoying). Overall though, this was a great product, and totally worth the price!</li>
    <li> Trimmed it to better fit what I was wanting, over all great wig for the price.</li>
    <li> Well actually I got this wig earlier than the expected delivery week and I had not had any trouble so the customer service I would rate a five star&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of this wig is great for it&#x27;s price and that the fact it is a synthetic wig&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is great it is a deep red not a very bright red but the color is vibrant and is so pretty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate this product four star just because it is a synthetic wig and I do prefer synthetic wigs but human hair wigs are superior&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the wig with to stocking caps but the wig had a funny odor but it left with a wash&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig is tolerable for everyday use too not just cosplay or Halloween...if you like red hair or to be different</li>
    <li> This one is crazy! The color is not passable for reality and it&#x27;s just here there and everywhere. I will use it for fun and for faires! I cut the bangs - but I still don&#x27;t know how I feel about it!</li>
    <li> I got the wig for a performance that I am going to do and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the wig for the price. It looks a little bit shorter than the picture but still cute. Have yet to cut it or style it really, but overall I think it is good for the price.</li>
    <li> The quality of this wig is very nice especially for the price. This was used for my mermaid costume.</li>
    <li> This is not what the wig looked like at all.  It wasn&#x27;t as long as pictured.  The color I received was more along the lines of a maroon color.  I have a headful of thick hair and wasn&#x27;t able to wear it at all even with a bald cap holding my hair in place.  I would maybe look for another option before buying this one.</li>
    <li> The thickness is just right, its not too shiney (as with allot of cheap wigs).the color is wonderul and natrual looking. sooo pleased that this is my first wig!</li>
    <li> I need this for a Poison Ivy costume for a party in July. It came in 2 days after I ordered it! I love the quality of the wig and the fact that it comes with a hair net, so that&#x27;s one less thing I need to worry about purchasing. Thank you for the wonderful service!</li>
    <li> I just got the wig, and had it on until I overheated (summertime!) It came with the wig and a mesh wig cap in a grey postal mail plastic package. I thought the package was a bit small for the wig, and was afraid the wig would be kinked up, but upon opening it I was pleasantly surprised. The hair is a lot more sultry and rich in color than the picture shown, and I love it. There was a slight tangling of the curls when I first opened it, but hey! This thing has been manhandled halfway across the globe to get to me, so with a little brushing that was easily solved. I was afraid that the wig head was a bit small when I first put it on, but with a little stretch it fits perfectly. and if I end up stretching it too much, it even has adjustable straps, so that&#x27;s a plus. The model in the picture must has a amazing forehead! I had to trim the bangs a wee bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as far as shipping, no complaints. it came a month earlier than the amazon estimated delivery, so that was absolutely fantastic. If you&#x27;re looking for wigs, choose this company, I&#x27;ve ordered a wig for Cool2Day three weeks before this wig, and it still hasn&#x27;t shown. Taobaopit is definitely the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a beautiful and fantastic wig for it&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s usually hard to find a red wig or red hair extensions because it&#x27;s either too pinky or fire-engine fake red. This red though looks natural. I&#x27;m a red head but hair breaks so it take forever to grow it out to this length if i can get it to grow at all, but this wig looked 100% real. Only thing is the part is a little off so you&#x27;ll have to play with it.</li>
    <li> tangles easily but still good.</li>
    <li> Wig didn&#x27;t for right, look flat at the top with no way of teasing hair for volume. Not a good fit for me.</li>
    <li> I was happy to see it arrive ahead of time but was a little disappointed with the color being off. It turned out to be a lighter red than what is displayed on here. But, it still works for my cosplay I think. I think you guys really need to work on the color of your wigs. Like in the picture it&#x27;s blood red but when I got the wig it was more of a plain red or even bright red.</li>
    <li> Love the color! High quality for a little price!!</li>
    <li> It is just as it looks in the picture. Long and very full. Bangs need to be cut to your desire.  Not a bad buy at all.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for the perfect wig to pull off Jessica Rabbit, Poison Ivy, and Ariel. well, this is it! It&#x27;s so full, and pretty decent in terms of fibers when you consider the price. It fits perfectly on my noggin, and it comes with a wig cap! I highly reccomend this for anyone who&#x27;s looking for a cheaper wig that works for many occasions!</li>
    <li> The wig is amazing, perfect quality!! it seemed a little shorter than pictured when i first took it out of the package but once the curls relaxed a little it was perfect. It is the perfect quality. I recieved many compliants and requests on where it was purchased. For such a cheap price i was trully impressed!</li>
