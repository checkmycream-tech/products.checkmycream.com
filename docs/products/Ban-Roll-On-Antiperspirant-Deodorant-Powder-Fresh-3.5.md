      <li>Not only does this product roll on great and not leave residue, it works when playing sports and hangs around for at least 24hrs.  </li>
      <li>Dries leaving a white film but that is to be expected with most deodorants.</li>
      <li>Dries in reasonable time and nowhere as \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; as some other roll-ons upon application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it !!!  Sometimes hard to find.</li>
    <li> Great product, long lasting and comfortable to use, not sticky. I have been using it for over 5 years and wouldn&#x27;t replace it</li>
    <li> Dries leaving a white film but that is to be expected with most deodorants.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  To me it&#x27;s the best. I&#x27;m so happy to be able to order on line.</li>
    <li> This was a great deal for this product.  Ban is my favorite underarm antiperspirant and this makes it more affordable.</li>
    <li> I have been using for many time. I love this product. I recommend.</li>
    <li> First of all, Ban&#x27;s Powder Fresh roll-on deodorant is appropriate for both men and women. We have been using it for decades. Keeps us nice and dry and the scent is never overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3.5 ounce size lasts a long time. Dries in reasonable time and nowhere as \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; as some other roll-ons upon application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure there are luxury deodorants which do a better job than the standard brand named products, like Ban. So what?! This works and the price is competitive.</li>
    <li> Ban is my favorite- - have used it 30 plus years and like the fresh scent.</li>
    <li> Love the stuff, not to perfumey</li>
    <li> This antiperspirant is very hard to find in the stores....it is costly, but worth every penny.  The best deodorant.</li>
    <li> I used Ban years ago and then I guess moved on to other brands. For the last years I have used Mitchum&#x27;s - since they have reformulated their scents and product I quit. I tried Secret (way too perfumey) and Ban. I LOVE BAN! The scent is absolutely PERFECT! -  blends well with my perfume and doesn&#x27;t give me a headache with overpowering scent.  We just had a very hot day here and I made it through with no sweat or odor. PLEASE don&#x27;t reformulate or change this product!!</li>
