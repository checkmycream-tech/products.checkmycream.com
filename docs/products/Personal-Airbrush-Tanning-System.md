      <li>I am pleased with my decision.  </li>

      <li>This item was fairly cheap compared to all the other tanning spray systems and I have to say I was quite impressed with this and very pleased with my purchase</li>
      <li>Plus it&#x27;s very powerful and has a great, large spray area.</li>
      <li>Very light, and quiet machine, did not like solution but was more interested in machine anyway not the greatest for spray tanning</li>
      <li>Best $60 I ever spent!</li>
      <li>The machine itself works very well and allows you to get nice even coverage.</li>
      <li>I would like to have a more powerful compressor but for the price it works .</li>
      <li>This machine is amazing for personal use and is easy to transport if you need to take it with you!</li>

      <li>I am absolutely thrilled to get such a great item at such an affordable price.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s easy to use and left me with nice, even tanned skin.</li>
      <li>Super annoyedto find that it has no warranty and is not returnable.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, (please read how to spray &amp; practice spraying water before the real deal) and clean.</li>
      <li>Practice with water first if you&#x27;ve never done an airbrush before!</li>

      <li>Overall great product and I was surprised at how compact it is!</li>
      <li>This little machine does great</li>
      <li>The shipping was quick and the pricing was very reasonable.</li>
      <li>Right now I&#x27;m using the solution it came with, but you can fill it with anything - Sjolie, Norvell, Ocean, ect.</li>
      <li>Practice first on paper before attempting on a person.</li>
      <li>MY FIRST TRY AT AIRBRUSH BODY ART.</li>
      <li>The gun is very well made too, I don&#x27;t see it falling apart any time soon!</li>
      <li>and it was delivered very promptly</li>
      <li>It takes FOREVER to spray my whole body.  </li>
      <li>am very excited to try other solutions</li>
      <li>Especially since I just purchased 5 bottles more bottle of the tanning solution from the same company 2 days ago.</li>
      <li>Not only did it come with a great, dark solution, but the machine is so compact and quiet!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>i highly recommend this product</li>
      <li>highly reccomend this machine</li>
      <li>i feel so much better with a little color and plan on using th his instead of sun tanning  </li>
      <li>the directions for set up are clearly written for a profesional.</li>
      <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because you really need to have a fan or dryer after.</li>
      <li>I was skeptical because the price was so good</li>
      <li>A little hard to get a even spray, but so far so good, would like a different tan solution the what it comes with</li>
      <li>Like a lot of other people, I was skeptical of this machine because of the great price.</li>

<li> Pretty hard to use.  </li>
<li> Just not really loving the whole spray tan experience now.</li>
<li> The hose and the electrical wire are also long</li>
<li> It can be adjusted with the trigger on the gun, and when its not pulled, it just blows air so you can dry your tan.</li>
<li> After reading the other reviews I decided to take a chance and purchase this item.  </li>
<li> You literally just plug the hose into the machine on one end and the stylus on the other, then plug in the electrical adapter.</li>
<li> it is small enough to travel with and include in your carry on.</li>
<li> Mine didn&#x27;t even blow hard enough to push the product through</li>
<li> To stop the mist you must shut down the compressor.</li>
<li> Results are comparable and the can is easier, less setup.</li>
<li> It makes quite a mess and wastes quite a bit of the product that you&#x27;re spraying.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your time, leave it to the airbrush artists..</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> One thing I&#x27;m confused about though, is this little white plastic tube it came with, I&#x27;m not sure what it&#x27;s for or</li>
<li> I expect it will take a while for me to develop my technique but the results of the first attempt were not that bad.  </li>
<li> The airbrush is about the size of a pencil, and the amount of liquid that comes out is very small.  </li>
<li> It was not a good quality machine.</li>
<li> Not sure why some people find it difficult to use and/or assemble..</li>
<li> IT IS VERY HARD TO GET A TAN FROM THIS MACHINE</li>
<li> I only gave this 2 stars because the spray gun didnt work at all very disappointing</li>
<li> Poor quality.</li>
<li> had it not so quickly broken.</li>
<li> as well have been in another language, they are impossible to understand even with a small diagram of all of the parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> AND LOOKS SILLY.  </li>
<li> Too bad I won&#x27;t have a machine to spray it on with.</li>
<li> Terrible timing for my upcoming beach vacation :(&lt;br /&gt;I would have given 10 stars for performance</li>

    <li> Pretty hard to use.  The airbrush is about the size of a pencil, and the amount of liquid that comes out is very small.  It takes FOREVER to spray my whole body.  It works well enough though.  Just not really loving the whole spray tan experience now.</li>
    <li> After reading the other reviews I decided to take a chance and purchase this item.  I am pleased with my decision.  It was relatively self explanatory.  I expect it will take a while for me to develop my technique but the results of the first attempt were not that bad.  The shipping was quick and the pricing was very reasonable.</li>
    <li> Did not spray, returned.</li>
    <li> Like a lot of other people, I was skeptical of this machine because of the great price. However, I honestly couldn&#x27;t have been happier! Not only did it come with a great, dark solution, but the machine is so compact and quiet! Plus it&#x27;s very powerful and has a great, large spray area. I find I use it on the medium setting for spray tanning, and low setting for contouring. The hose and the electrical wire are also long so I have plenty of room to move the gun around. The gun is very well made too, I don&#x27;t see it falling apart any time soon! It can be adjusted with the trigger on the gun, and when its not pulled, it just blows air so you can dry your tan. I like how it came with two sized cups, but I found I had to refill the larger cup halfway through my tan. Not a deal breaker, maybe I should have just conserved my solution more. It was also awesome that the machine came with a case! One thing I&#x27;m confused about though, is this little white plastic tube it came with, I&#x27;m not sure what it&#x27;s for or what it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re debating about getting this, get it! I no longer have to pay $24 for a spray tan at the salon, and get even better results in the privacy of my own home! Plus I can give my friends spray tans, and I can use any solution I want! Right now I&#x27;m using the solution it came with, but you can fill it with anything - Sjolie, Norvell, Ocean, ect. Best $60 I ever spent!</li>
    <li> this was a great lil airbrush system for at home use</li>
    <li> I think I prefer the ease from a can ... Results are comparable and the can is easier, less setup.</li>
    <li> i have had several airbrush machines and this is the best. it doesn&#x27;t clog and has a nice fine mist that goes on evenly. it is small enough to travel with and include in your carry on. i highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Machine worked well with the product included for about 8-10 sprays and then it just stopped working. The trigger lost all temsion &amp; will no longer spray even though air flows through when the compressor is running. Super annoyedto find that it has no warranty and is not returnable. Especially since I just purchased 5 bottles more bottle of the tanning solution from the same company 2 days ago. Too bad I won&#x27;t have a machine to spray it on with. Guess I will be returning those when they arrive in 3 days. Terrible timing for my upcoming beach vacation :(&lt;br /&gt;I would have given 10 stars for performance had it not so quickly broken. I can handle buying one a year at $50 but not every 2 months!</li>
    <li> A little hard to get a even spray, but so far so good, would like a different tan solution the what it comes with</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work from day one. It would blow air, but none of the solution came out. I followed the instructions step by step and never worked. Piece of junk. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works well. Excellent value for the price.</li>
    <li> Its a fair price for the product. Practice first on paper before attempting on a person.</li>
    <li> The machine itself works very well and allows you to get nice even coverage. However the tanner that came with the machine didn&#x27;t work too well. I have really fair skin and it still didn&#x27;t tan too well. I would suggest buying the machine and using a different solution.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful and it was delivered very promptly</li>
    <li> Works so good. I was skeptical because the price was so good but the product works awesome and glad i got it!</li>
    <li> I love the ease of use on this item . I would like to have a more powerful compressor but for the price it works .</li>
    <li> It works but,  the air flow/spray flow is constant. It can&#x27;t be turned on and off with the silver push forward button. It makes quite a mess and wastes quite a bit of the product that you&#x27;re spraying.</li>
    <li> ONLY BUT THIS IF YOU KNOW A PRO THAT KNOWS HOW TO APPLY IT.  TRUED IT MY SELF AND LOOKS SILLY.  MY FAMILY ALL LAUGHED AT ME.  IF YOU ARE NOT TRAINED TO DO THIS DON&#x27;T.  IT IS VERY HARD TO GET A TAN FROM THIS MACHINE IF YOU ARE NOT TRAINED.  JUST GO TO A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE ARE TRAINED TO DO IT.</li>
    <li> I actually have to return this, All the peices were there and it was in perfect condition but the directions for set up are clearly written for a profesional. Don&#x27;t waste your time, leave it to the airbrush artists.. also the one flaw I did not understand is the machine does not have a way to &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; the mist. To stop the mist you must shut down the compressor. Keep in mind I am usually very good at assembly, the directions mine as well have been in another language, they are impossible to understand even with a small diagram of all of the parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THIS WAS MY FIRST TRY AT AIRBRUSH BODY ART. I COULD NOT EVEN GET THE THING TOGETHER NOR DID I TRY TO USE IT WITH ANY WATER OR PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I only gave this 2 stars because the spray gun didnt work at all very disappointing I wanted a tan lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used an airbrush tanner before and was so excited to try this. Not sure why some people find it difficult to use and/or assemble.. You literally just plug the hose into the machine on one end and the stylus on the other, then plug in the electrical adapter. There are also instructions to guide you through these steps if you need it...&lt;br /&gt;It continually sprays a stream of air, and by pressing on the button on the stylus you release the solution. Practice with water first if you&#x27;ve never done an airbrush before! Overall great product and I was surprised at how compact it is! Can take this anywhere with me! Highly recommend</li>
    <li> This item was fairly cheap compared to all the other tanning spray systems and I have to say I was quite impressed with this and very pleased with my purchase and I recommend.</li>
    <li> Mine didn&#x27;t even blow hard enough to push the product through</li>
    <li> This system works well, it&#x27;s easy to use and left me with nice, even tanned skin. I&#x27;ve had several spray tans at the spa, and this turned out just as good. I am pleased with this project and price!</li>
    <li> gun broke after second use.</li>
    <li> This is so easy to use and the tanning product is great. I am absolutely thrilled to get such a great item at such an affordable price. Very very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I returned the product. It was not a good quality machine. Poor quality.</li>
    <li> This machine is amazing for personal use and is easy to transport if you need to take it with you!</li>
    <li> Very light, and quiet machine, did not like solution but was more interested in machine anyway not the greatest for spray tanning but it gets it done, great seller thank you!</li>
    <li> Before purchasing an airbrush tanning system, I did some research and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot since I&#x27;ve never sprayed tanned from home before. This little machine does great, my mom and I both used it and it&#x27;s so much better than going to a salon. Very light weight and portable. Easy to use, (please read how to spray &amp; practice spraying water before the real deal) and clean. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because you really need to have a fan or dryer after. After spraying in my walk in shower and just went to the bedroom where I have big cyclone fan that did the trick. Other than that, this system is fantastic and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> i &#x27;m saying 5 stars  this machine is perfect for the price  extremly easy set up and just as easy to use  i used it as soon as i got it and i have to say , its awsome  !!  i feel so much better with a little color and plan on using th his instead of sun tanning  all together  am very excited to try other solutions and mabye mixing some for a custom tan highly reccomend this machine</li>
