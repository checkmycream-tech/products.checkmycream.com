      <li>Works, clean, what more can you say</li>
      <li>One things is that it works and it is easy tobuse.  </li>
      <li>I started using this product when it was still available on the shelves</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t have these available where I like</li>
      <li>We were using another similar product, but we switched to the Sure because it was more effective.</li>
      <li>It is so convenient to be able to order this product from Amazon instead of searching the store for exactly what I want and don&#x27;t always find.  </li>
      <li>Sure, you can get other types of deodorant, and sure, they may protect you, but nothing quite covers like Sure.  </li>
      <li>I bought the Sure invisible Solid Deodorant by accident (wanted Sure Original).  </li>
      <li>goofy generic smells that come in most antiperspirants.</li>
      <li>Best stuff out there with no nasty fake smell.</li>
      <li>When I received the order, it was the new sure.</li>

      <li>the product is fine, the cost is reasonable and the seller does their job well</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years, and the product works quite well for me, and rarely leaves any marks on clothes.</li>
      <li>Sure unscented really is completely unscented.</li>
      <li>I was so excited and very grateful</li>
      <li>When I&#x27;m down to the last one, I re-order from my best freind Amazon</li>
      <li>Do you want to be confident, dry and secure?  </li>
      <li>Fortunately, I found it available on-line at Amazon and ordered a back stock to carry my through for a number of years.</li>
      <li>Sure is as good as Secret but doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find this product in the various stores I shop at.  </li>
      <li>I am pleased with the ease and the lasting protection of the product.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use Sure as my one and only deodorant.</li>
      <li>It sounds like a small thing, but try getting a teenaged boy to carry this into the gym locker room without getting laughed at for using girl&#x27;s deodorant.</li>
      <li>This product has been my main antiperspirant/deodorant for many years but recently, the stores have stopped carrying it.  </li>
      <li>Dove is really smoothing but greasy by comparison.</li>
      <li>This Sure does not leave marks on clothes look wet or greasy like some &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; deodorants do.</li>
      <li>and it protects very well.</li>
      <li>this is getting hard to find in stores, so good old Amazon came through</li>
      <li>i use this particular deodarent.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this brand since high school</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>This is an effective Antiperspirant and Deodorant that does not compete with your perfume or lotion as it is truly unscented, The other big plus is the &amp;#34;Invisible&amp;#34; part.. It doesn&#x27;t stain or rub off on clothes the way the Dove version does.</li>
      <li>I am glad that unscented Sure is available because I really don&#x27;t like the artificial odors that are in pratically every other type of deodorant.</li>
      <li>a new version, which I didn&#x27;t want.</li>
      <li>It is not strong enough and it is not 100% reliable for warm climates.</li>
      <li>If you want musk scented then don&#x27;t use deodorant and let it happen naturally.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and have to use unscented products</li>
      <li>Good price on unscented product, which is difficult to find locally.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t have B.O. even at the end of a tough or super hot day...</li>
      <li>We developed a red welt/rash after use.</li>
      <li>I have looked and looked for Sure deodorant for a long time, seems all that the stores are carrying is Secret which does nothing for me, and I also have a sensitive nose</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found it keeps me dry and allergy free (I&#x27;ve had issues with irritation from past deodorants) and doesn&#x27;t stain my shirts.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this deodorant but the label is misleading.  I ordered the deodorant in the green container.  When I received the order, it was the new sure.</li>
    <li> It works,what else can I say. Other items are ineffective or give me a rash. this is getting hard to find in stores, so good old Amazon came through</li>
    <li> While i have used this product in the past, not only do I find the &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; odor objectionable, it doesn&#x27;t do the job it&#x27;s intended to do.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for more years than I care to count.  I think it is a quality product with the desired effect I&#x27;m looking for - it works, no scent and a solid so there&#x27;s nothing to stain clothing.  Simply put, it works!</li>
    <li> I used to use this product, and usually bought it at local supermarkets; I decided to order it online, but the quality is not the same. It is not strong enough and it is not 100% reliable for warm climates. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and does not leave too many marks on my shirt.  Best part about it is that it has no smell and it protects very well.</li>

It doesn&#x27;t stain or rub off on clothes the way the Dove version does. Dove is really smoothing but greasy by comparison. This Sure does not leave marks on clothes look wet or greasy like some &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; deodorants do.</li>
    <li> Works great for me.  No scent or residue.  Only brand I buy.</li>
    <li> Great deodorant with not scent and no powdery mess.</li>
    <li> How do you write something nice about chemicals that keep you from smelling bad?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No perfumes... check, (double check says the dude allergic to them)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have B.O. even at the end of a tough or super hot day... check&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes on easy... check</li>
    <li> Best stuff out there with no nasty fake smell.</li>
    <li> I mean how much of this stuff could I possibly use?  I like the solid not the gel (yuck) and this is &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; without any smell.  Fits the bill. Always has!</li>
    <li> Been using Sure since I was a teenager, and nothing else ever worked as well for me.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. Excellent product and a great deal. We were using another similar product, but we switched to the Sure because it was more effective. Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, and the product works quite well for me, and rarely leaves any marks on clothes. But what blows my mind is the weird, purple feminine-looking packaging. I get that maybe this is for both men and women, but I actually thought my local store stopped carrying this brand, only to find out even they were placing in the woman&#x27;s section because of the lavender labeling. It sounds like a small thing, but try getting a teenaged boy to carry this into the gym locker room without getting laughed at for using girl&#x27;s deodorant. I wish they would bring the old green labels back.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t have these available where I like so I just decided to order them from Amazon instead of going thru the hassle of trial and error with other brands. I&#x27;ve found it keeps me dry and allergy free (I&#x27;ve had issues with irritation from past deodorants) and doesn&#x27;t stain my shirts.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband -pictured here is the men&#x27;s version,  but what I received was the women&#x27;s version.</li>
    <li> Has masking fragrance. Endocrine disrupter. I bought Ban instead.</li>
    <li> Sure is as good as Secret but doesn&#x27;t break me out. Husband and I both use it. Like the unscented because it doesn&#x27;t clash with our colognes.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find this product in the various stores I shop at.  I guess deodorants are sort of like toothpastes or boxed cereals.  There are just too many brands to fit them all on retailer&#x27;s shelves.  I started using this product when it was still available on the shelves and I was glad I could find it on Amazon.  I had tried a few other brands and I was not satisfied (too wet, greasy feeling, etc.)</li>
    <li> I tried a different brand when I ran out but it was so sticky I had to buy this in bulk.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It is so convenient to be able to order this product from Amazon instead of searching the store for exactly what I want and don&#x27;t always find.  I love the convenience of the multi-pack.  It saves me both time and money. When I&#x27;m down to the last one, I re-order from my best freind Amazon</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s unscented. I like unscented antiperspirant because then I can wear smells from my cologne collection instead of goofy generic smells that come in most antiperspirants. This antiperspirant in other ways is just like other antiperspirants, just with less smell.</li>
    <li> There are segeral reasins thwt i use this particular deodarent.  One things is that it works and it is easy tobuse.  Also, since it is unscented, it does not clash with my perfume.  Also, i have a dear brother in law that has hunningtons disease and this is the only deodarant that coexists with medicines he is on.  I am glad i bought this 6 pack because i was in ahouse fire and fifteen of us lost everthing, so i handed out deoderant.  H</li>
    <li> I could not find sure in the store.  So I went to Amazon and looked there and low and behold there it was.  I was so happy that I got the 6 pack so that I would not have to worried about where I am going to get the unscented.  Thank you Amazon for carring this item. A great purchase.</li>
    <li> Works, clean, what more can you say</li>
    <li> Do you want to be confident, dry and secure?  Raise your hand.  Raise your hand if you&#x27;re sure.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for 20+ years.  Very difficult to find at most stores.  One of the few unscented deodorants.  I still haven&#x27;t figured out why you would want a deodorant with a scent.  That seems to defeat the purpose.  Especially the people that buy &amp;#34;musk scented&amp;#34;.  If you want musk scented then don&#x27;t use deodorant and let it happen naturally.</li>
    <li> Thank you the item is great!</li>
    <li> Very good value for the price. I am glad that unscented Sure is available because I really don&#x27;t like the artificial odors that are in pratically every other type of deodorant.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using this for years and it&#x27;s a favorite item.  I now know to buy it from Amazon. The product works well as we stay dry all day and evening. It&#x27;s truly unscented and doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on the body or your clothes.  This works great.</li>
    <li> Sure, you can get other types of deodorant, and sure, they may protect you, but nothing quite covers like Sure.  I feel literally invincible.  If I&#x27;ve had a hard day at work and walk in my front door, I know the stinkiest thing in the house will be my dog, followed by my baby&#x27;s diaper pail, followed by the kitchen trash . . . and then maybe we get to armpit but even then I bet I smell like a hundred dollars.  I briefly tried some sort of tea tree oil deodorant, and it made me smell like patchouli, acoustic guitars, and bad decisions.  This stuff leaves me smelling like me.  Can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> I have been using this deodorant for many years now,  do not leave a stains on your shirts&lt;br /&gt;no doors for 24 hours or more</li>
    <li> Take heed: What is pictured here is the men&#x27;s version of this product, but when I ordered it, what I received was the women&#x27;s version!</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand since high school and I have never been unsure.  Works as needed but does leave a white residue but then again I am a guy who usually wears a shirts etc. so not much of a worry for me.</li>
    <li> This is a little odd, I got something completely different than the picture... a new version, which I didn&#x27;t want.</li>
    <li> the product is fine, the cost is reasonable and the seller does their job well</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the ease and the lasting protection of the product. I will continue to use Sure as my one and only deodorant.</li>
    <li> Good price on unscented product, which is difficult to find locally.</li>
    <li> I have been using this deodorant for the last 6 years. This deodorant works great for controlling underarm moisture and smell and is unscented which I need. Being able to purchase this from Amazon is beneficial because for some reason in my area the unscented Sure is a hit and miss proposition. I recommend this to anyone looking for a good, unscented anti-perspirant/deodorant.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and have to use unscented products plus I don&#x27;t like the white residue regular stick deodorants leaves on clothing.  This product has been my main antiperspirant/deodorant for many years but recently, the stores have stopped carrying it.  Fortunately, I found it available on-line at Amazon and ordered a back stock to carry my through for a number of years.</li>
    <li> is not the same as the picture, also is not invisible solid</li>
    <li> I have looked and looked for Sure deodorant for a long time, seems all that the stores are carrying is Secret which does nothing for me, and I also have a sensitive nose so I have to buy the unsented so I won&#x27;t get headaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other brands but nothing seemed to work for my system as well as&lt;br /&gt;Sure does. Just out of the blue one day I thought I would try Amazon and low and behold they have it!! I was so excited and very grateful and so is my family and co-workers!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the Sure invisible Solid Deodorant by accident (wanted Sure Original).  We developed a red welt/rash after use. Although we have talked to other who have used this product and had no problems at all. We will stick to using Sure Original as we have never had a problem with it.</li>
    <li> Fast ship, good price.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant and I buy it in bulk so we don&#x27;t run out and become funky. Good price.</li>
    <li> Simply the best. Been using this for 40+ years.</li>
    <li> I was a life long Speed Stick Sport Talc user until Mennen dropped it a while back. Sure solid unscented is a mediocre replacement.  But it goes on dry and does the job. The old Sport Talc had a very very light scent to it. Sure unscented really is completely unscented.</li>
