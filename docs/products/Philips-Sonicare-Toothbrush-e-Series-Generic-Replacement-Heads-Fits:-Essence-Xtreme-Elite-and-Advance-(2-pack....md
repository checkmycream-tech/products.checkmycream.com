      <li>remain the same, it is more economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>The durability of the product seems as good as, if not better, than their genuine equivalent, especially the bristles.</li>
      <li>Very please with the generics.  </li>
      <li>fast delivery service.</li>
      <li>It worked fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>they are cheap enough  to change often.</li>
      <li>I love not paying the ridiculous cost of genuine Sonicare brush heads.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the original heads for over ten years.</li>
      <li>Delivered on time &amp; fits the same as the original</li>
      <li>and at half the price :-)</li>
      <li>These generic brush heads are definitely a better deal, even when compared to buying in bulk at big box membership stores.</li>
      <li>I will continue to buy these and never pay the high prices again.</li>
      <li>Great replacement alternatives for the official ones that are really expensive.</li>
      <li>I bought these for spares, so when I need a new one, I have one in stock.</li>
      <li>As a result, they make a very loud buzzing noise any time you use the brush.</li>
      <li>I just wish they were a slightly tighter fit.  </li>
      <li>I had completely forgotten I had done so.  </li>
      <li>Saved me considerable money.</li>
      <li>Wow, someone got greedy.  </li>
      <li>As far as cleaning teeth, I feel and see no difference.  </li>
      <li>So far, they have held up well</li>
      <li>wow.</li>
      <li>Loud, not comparable.</li>
      <li>Seem to work every bit as good as the expensive brand name blister pack product.</li>
      <li>The bristles feel of the same quality, the build is exactly the same, and, unlike another generic I&#x27;ve tried, it&#x27;s actually QUIETER than the OEM</li>
      <li>The only major difference I can notice between these generic toothbrush heads and the sonicare heads is the price.  </li>
      <li>These brush heads are a little louder than the originals, but I don&#x27;t really think that&#x27;s a big deal</li>

    <li> Cheap and fast.  Works fine.</li>

    <li> Heads work well with handle but the bristles are a little too soft for my preference.</li>
    <li> WORK JUST A GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL ONES</li>
    <li> Works like the originals!</li>
    <li> Fits well with my e series.</li>
    <li> Great price for my old Sonicare Toothbrush. These work great and you cannot beat the price. As soon as I made sure that they worked, I turned around and ordered two more heads.  My dental hygienist says that I should replace the heads every three months.  I admit that I was not quite complying, but now I am set for the next year.  I will order these again.  Great deal.</li>
    <li> Very please with the generics.  Works about the same for me.  The bristles might be a tad softer, but overall, a great value.</li>
    <li> Why spend more for the name-brand brush heads when these are just the same - and cheaper? No-brainer!!</li>
    <li> Works well with no noise.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the original heads for over ten years. These are just as good.</li>
    <li> Great Buy and they fit and work Great!</li>
    <li> Great replacement alternatives for the official ones that are really expensive.</li>
    <li> Great value and works wonderfully with my Sonicare toothbrush. Will most certainly be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> comparable to the original</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good fit perfectly in my toothbrush</li>
    <li> a little loud but work well for price</li>
    <li> Wonderful it fit perfecly whit my toohtbrush &amp;#34;e serie&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The only major difference I can notice between these generic toothbrush heads and the sonicare heads is the price.  These generic brush heads are definitely a better deal, even when compared to buying in bulk at big box membership stores. The brush heads fit perfectly with the sonicare body and are secure when in use.  These brush heads are a little louder than the originals, but I don&#x27;t really think that&#x27;s a big deal and it doesn&#x27;t affect its use in any way.  The actual bristles are a little on the stiff side, so if you are looking for a soft or extra soft bristles, then this isn&#x27;t the one for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing Sonicare replacements,wanted to experiment with a generic.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality and will continue to order this replacement,providing the quality/service remain the same, it is more economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7-18-15 PLEASE NOTE: I&#x27;M CHANGING MY REVIEW.  ONE OF THESE SONICARE REPLACEMENT HEADS APPEARS TO BE DEFECTIVE,CHANGED MY MIND WILL NOT BEING BUYING THEM AGAIN. IT DID NOT PERFORM WELL.</li>
    <li> Fit my e-series perfect.  I definitely recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> Loud, not comparable.</li>
    <li> Fits like a glove, and half the price. score!</li>
    <li> Bristles are much harder  then the Sonicare. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> wow. fast delivery service. good, affordable product. will definitely do business again. tłhanx.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout to be a cheapo, looking for generics, refurbs, and discounts. However, doing this, you&#x27;re guaranteed to run across some bad cookies. Generic brands are usually lower in quality to the brand name they&#x27;re meant to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, these replacement heads, in my opinion, are head and shoulders above the originals. The bristles feel of the same quality, the build is exactly the same, and, unlike another generic I&#x27;ve tried, it&#x27;s actually QUIETER than the OEM heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this over the standard Sonicare heads.</li>
    <li> I changed out my OEM head for one of these, and literally halfway through brushing my teeth I had completely forgotten I had done so.  No difference I could tell at all.  Not an enormous price savings, but every little bit helps.  I will definitely buy these again.  Edit:  Wow, someone got greedy.  The price somehow doubled since I bought them and now there are much more affordable alternatives.  Would not buy these again at this price.</li>
    <li> These work just as well as the originals.  I just wish they were a slightly tighter fit.  Like several other reviewers, I get quite a bit of extra vibration and noise compared to the originals.  As far as cleaning teeth, I feel and see no difference.  Despite the extra noise, I still think these are a great buy.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Time will tell. I think it&#x27;s a plus they are cheap enough  to change often.</li>
    <li> I have bought generic toothbrush heads in the past and they have been awful. With these I cannot tell a difference whatsoever!! I will continue to buy these and never pay the high prices again. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> The toothbrushes arrived without any problems</li>
    <li> Very happy with generic e series replacement heads.  I always look to get a bargain.  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Thank you work Perfect!!!!</li>
    <li> Was not able to detect any difference from the Phillips product</li>
    <li> I like these brushes, and have been using them for years.</li>
    <li> The bristles are a little stiff compared to original OEM and it&#x27;s definitely louder to operate.  Does it work, yep! and at half the price :-)</li>
    <li> Great value as well as working well. What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> Delivered on time &amp; fits the same as the original</li>
    <li> works well. I cannot tell the difference from the original Phillips replacement heads, and I have been using them about 2 months now.</li>
    <li> 1 of the 2 brush heads doesn&#x27;t go on the sonic care e series base very well- also the bristles seem much harder than the soft that we are used to.</li>
    <li> Works as good as the original toothbrush head</li>
    <li> These head replacements fit perfectly and were reasonably priced. So far, they have held up well so I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I personally like the ones made by Sonicare. They are smoother and I can tell a difference. The question is if you want to spend $26 or $12.</li>
    <li> They seem just like the origiinals to me - only half the price.</li>
    <li> They are perfect...love it!</li>
    <li> Saved me considerable money. Works fine.</li>
    <li> Arrived by USPS on Sunday, as advertised, and a whole lot less expensive than the ones at the drug store.  Fits my Sonicare perfectly, and I can&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
    <li> Works well and fits well, just like the originals except the bristles seem less sturdy (but still a great value compared to the original refills in terms of price). It is totally fine with me since these are much cheaper and therefore I can afford to change them more often. The plastics used is good with no funny smells. Overall, I am thankful I have this option to refill. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Love it.  A much better price on replacement brush heads.  Seem to work every bit as good as the expensive brand name blister pack product.</li>
    <li> works as good as the orig style</li>
    <li> Great price and quick turn around.</li>
    <li> Great value.  Excellent quality.</li>
    <li> Great value, and they last a really long time.</li>
    <li> This is generic not made by Sonicare. Works well at 40% of the price of name brand replacements. Just saw another one on Amazon as of 7/23/15 where they were about $3 a brush</li>
    <li> They fit perfectly, work great and cost much less.  Very satisfied with this product</li>
    <li> They worked perfectly and look great for a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> These work very well! Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I bought these for spares, so when I need a new one, I have one in stock.</li>
    <li> Great deal. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Just like OEM, only less expensive. Operates just like the original.</li>
    <li> BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL. Great value, great quality.</li>
    <li> Price was right. It worked fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Replacement head was great</li>
    <li> Very good product and even a better price</li>
    <li> Works great. A very good value.</li>
    <li> I love not paying the ridiculous cost of genuine Sonicare brush heads. The durability of the product seems as good as, if not better, than their genuine equivalent, especially the bristles. However, they do not screw on to my brush as securely as the real version. As a result, they make a very loud buzzing noise any time you use the brush. If you can live with that then this is a great way to save money!</li>
