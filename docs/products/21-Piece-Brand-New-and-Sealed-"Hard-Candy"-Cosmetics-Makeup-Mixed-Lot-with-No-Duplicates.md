<li> so I&#x27;ll regift them to my 15yr old niece.</li>
<li> Other than that I&#x27;m very content with it all.</li>
<li> I received this today it came with 1 cc cream, 2 different spotlighters all over highlighter, 5 solid powder eyeshadow, 1 loose glitter, 1 neon liquid eyeliner, 5 nail polish,1 glossaholic, 1 stay in line eyeliner, 1 eyeliner with sharpener, 1 stroke of gorgeous,1 shadow stick,3 different lip def,1 whipped brightening concealer, 1 skin clarifying concealer,1 volumizing lip gloss, 1 eye def.</li>
<li> My curious mind actually counted the products and I ended up getting 31 different cosmetic products!</li>
<li> but it was far from what I received cr&amp;egrave;me foundation was not in there only two small packages of eye shadow minimal eye liner not even close to products shown</li>
<li> You get a vibrant assortment of different Hard Candy products and it&#x27;s like a mystery box treasure chest that arrives at your door!</li>
<li> If you are purchasing this item to see what you end up with at random, you are doing it right!</li>
<li> I got highlighter(2), 5 tubes of lip gloss, 5 eye shadows, 2 tubes of nail polish, two tubes of eyeshadow, loose glitter, 5-in-one correction crème, cover up, concealer, shimmer, and black &amp; blue eyeliner.</li>
<li> Only like half is stuff I&#x27;ll use.</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
<li> This is my second time buying the Hard Candy lot.</li>
<li> I mean the effort was obvious.</li>
<li> Be AWARE that it is RANDOM!</li>
<li> ... seams like a waste to send strangers foundation</li>
<li> If you are expecting to get specific things, you are setting yourself up for disappointment.</li>
<li> Some of the pencils were broken.</li>
<li> Was disappointed with some of the items.</li>

    <li> I did get some duplicates but i still loved what i got!</li>
    <li> I would have give it a 5 star. I love it good quality, nice selection nothing was duplicate the only thing I had a problem was the concealer and  power was cater to the light and tan skin. I really believe should  make gear toward all skin color.  it worth the buy if your light or tan</li>
    <li> Most products shown did not even get shipped. I loved the way the products looked as shown in the photos but it was far from what I received cr&amp;egrave;me foundation was not in there only two small packages of eye shadow minimal eye liner not even close to products shown</li>

Excellent purchase. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Was disappointed with some of the items. Most of them were glitter pencil eyeliners which I really didn&#x27;t need so I&#x27;ll regift them to my 15yr old niece. The nail polishes are great and some eyeshadows. Wished there would have been lip products and cheek products. Overall ok.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my order!! Not only did i recieve more than 21 peices but i loved every single thing i received! No duplicates and its like if the seller knew exactly what to put in my package, im very very pleased !!</li>
    <li> I purchased the 15 piece set like a week ago and loved it SO MUCH! NO duplicates, everything was brand new, and in a great variety! I just bought the 21 piece set. :) Will definitely be buying even more!</li>
    <li> Alright…so, before I get ahead of myself, this buy was SO MUCH FUN! You get a vibrant assortment of different Hard Candy products and it&#x27;s like a mystery box treasure chest that arrives at your door! I have seen comments stating that people didn&#x27;t get what they were &amp;#34;expecting.&amp;#34; Be AWARE that it is RANDOM! If you are expecting to get specific things, you are setting yourself up for disappointment. If you are purchasing this item to see what you end up with at random, you are doing it right! I personally got eye liners, shadows, cc cream, concealers, glitters, nail polish…and a lot of gloss. I don&#x27;t use gloss much, but that&#x27;s what I expected…that I would get things I didn&#x27;t want as well as what I like.&lt;br /&gt;  Please, read the word &amp;#34;random&amp;#34; before you buy...</li>
    <li> I was cautious when I first saw this but ended up buying it anyway. I&#x27;m so happy that I did. I love the colors of everything. Everything was sealed and never used. There were duplicates of some products but they were different colors so I don&#x27;t mind. Definitely want to buy another one. My curious mind actually counted the products and I ended up getting 31 different cosmetic products! Love, love, love. It was worth the money!</li>
    <li> No duplicates and everything was new and sealed. I loved everything and received my order fast. Will be buying again!</li>
    <li> I loved everything! This is a great assortment and an amazing deal! I received eye shadows, eyeliners, lip glosses, lip colors, face brighteners, concealers, correction cream, nail polish, and even more. This kit is a makeup lover&#x27;s dream! I would highly recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> I got a few extra items, which was nice. Only one item was unusable- a cc creme that had likely spoiled in the heat and gone watery. I live in Vegas, so, it&#x27;s to be expected. There were duplicates, but in different colours. I don&#x27;t regret my purchase, but I likely won&#x27;t do it again. Only like half is stuff I&#x27;ll use. I got a lot of lip gloss, and I really only like lipstick.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the variety. I got highlighter(2), 5 tubes of lip gloss, 5 eye shadows, 2 tubes of nail polish, two tubes of eyeshadow, loose glitter, 5-in-one correction crème, cover up, concealer, shimmer, and black &amp; blue eyeliner. I was supposed to get 21 pieces but I got 2 extra! Will buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> Absolutely luv it it is definitely worth the money I&#x27;ll buy again. 😊</li>
    <li> It was a very good purchase, only one thing I did not like was that it specifically said I wouldn&#x27;t get duplicates, and I did. Other than that I&#x27;m very content with it all.</li>
    <li> Eh I got mostly lip gloss...&lt;br /&gt;For some reason they sent foundation, cc cream, concealer all of Wichita don&#x27;t match my skin... seams like a waste to send strangers foundation I won&#x27;t be ordering again 22 products total</li>
    <li> VERY happy with what I received. Got amazing products and the only thing I gave away was a red lip gloss (not my color) worth the money!!!!</li>
    <li> Some of the pencils were broken. Other than it was fine.</li>
    <li> Got so much stuff it was like Christmas great buy I immediately ordered another! !!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my second time buying the Hard Candy lot. First time I got the 15 piece and loved it so I decided to go ahead with the 21 piece and I&#x27;m so happy I did. I really love everything I received. I could not be more satisfied.  I feel like the seller actually took the time to hand pick items that went together and complimented one another instead of just throwing 21 pieces into a bag. The nail polish was even wrapped separately from the makeup products and tucked snugly at the bottom.  I mean the effort was obvious. I will definitely purchase again in the future and highly recommend to anyone interested.  It is definitely worth the money!  Love Love Love my purchase!</li>
