      <li>Cute for a child gift.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize they were plastic but cute anyways.</li>
      <li>I think the plastic is better though because then it can&#x27;t irritate your ears.</li>
      <li>Not the most durable,</li>
      <li>They are just so cute and almost unnoticable in the ear until the glint of silver catches your eye.</li>
      <li>But that is ok because I bought them for my daughter.</li>
      <li>I love them</li>
      <li>we&#x27;re kinda crappy but the earrings cute</li>
      <li>instead of the mushrooms, which were my favorite ones.</li>
      <li>So many selection to choose from and very comfortable to wear and strong.</li>
      <li>Very cute, worth the price, arrived early!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>Really nice and was worth the price</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t matter because this is a good product, I highly suggest it.</li>
      <li>Cool and cute but don&#x27;t sleep with them on they break easily</li>
      <li>Even though they&#x27;re plastic, they fit well in my ears and have yet to break.</li>
      <li>One of my girls is allergic to cheap earrings &amp; needs sterling silver.</li>
      <li>For the price, they are very worth it.</li>
      <li>They are pretty but they break easily.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re very cute except they break easily so be aware and careful.</li>
      <li>Adorable, but extremely tiny....</li>
      <li>The SS plated &amp; plastic posts works great for her since she loses earrings a lot from playing with covers &amp; pulling shirts over her head.</li>
      <li>They are perfect for my kids ears, small enough so they don&#x27;t cover their earlobes.</li>
      <li>Very tiny; perfect for second, third, etc.</li>
      <li>they are tiny and break easy.</li>
      <li>and they don&#x27;t even really like them.</li>
      <li>Overall: cheaply made, not as described, wouldn&#x27;t order again.</li>
      <li>I even ordered another pack for a friend who likes them as much as I do</li>
      <li>They look like real silver.</li>
      <li>There are multiple designs and they are so nice and simple.</li>
      <li>These are cute, they have a half plastic post and come with rubber backs.</li>
      <li>the earrings were small and they are very easy to bend and break</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m surprised how fast they were delivered.</li>
      <li>They come in exactly as shown in the picture, except they were much tinier than I expected.</li>
      <li>But there are cute little stars, hearts, flowers and one pair of corn!!</li>
      <li>It surprised me when I saw that the backs and pole were a plastic-like material.</li>
      <li>Also mine arrived +10 days early I was waiting for mine September 1-18 and got it August 14th.</li>
      <li>I also did not realize that the actual post that goes through the ear would not be made of metal; it is instead made of some clear material.</li>
      <li>I just received these earrings the other day in the mail and let me say the shipping was really fast.</li>

<li> It was the quality they said, and I have been carful with them and none have broken, it has been around two monthes, the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I wanted the ones in the picture and got a few different ones.</li>
<li> sad I got corn earrings (?)</li>
<li> The plastic also doesn&#x27;t bother my skin like some fake metals.</li>
<li> was unhappy with them!</li>

    <li> Very tiny; perfect for second, third, etc. earring holes.</li>
    <li> I just received these earrings the other day in the mail and let me say the shipping was really fast. There are multiple designs and they are so nice and simple. I was a little surprised that the back was plastic but it doesn&#x27;t matter because this is a good product, I highly suggest it.</li>

    <li> They are perfect for my kids ears, small enough so they don&#x27;t cover their earlobes. I didn&#x27;t care for were the backs but for the price of these I can deal with that. One of my girls is allergic to cheap earrings &amp; needs sterling silver. The SS plated &amp; plastic posts works great for her since she loses earrings a lot from playing with covers &amp; pulling shirts over her head. I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Therr were only enough back for 6 pair of them&lt;br /&gt;They should have all came with backs!!&lt;br /&gt;I was unhappy with them!</li>
    <li> Shipping was a lot faster than expected. These are cute, they have a half plastic post and come with rubber backs. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great price for 18 earrings. They look like real silver. They come in exactly as shown in the picture, except they were much tinier than I expected. But that is ok because I bought them for my daughter. They have the plastic backings instead of metal. They are just so cute and almost unnoticable in the ear until the glint of silver catches your eye.</li>
    <li> There great but they are plastic. I think the plastic is better though because then it can&#x27;t irritate your ears. Also mine arrived +10 days early I was waiting for mine September 1-18 and got it August 14th.</li>
    <li> Adorable, but extremely tiny....</li>
    <li> It was the quality they said, and I have been carful with them and none have broken, it has been around two monthes, the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I wanted the ones in the picture and got a few different ones.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know the post  (the part that goes in the hole) was plastic not metal. They&#x27;re very cute except they break easily so be aware and careful.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Very Cheap looking. I order them for my girls and they don&#x27;t even really like them.</li>
    <li> Cute for a child gift. Not the most durable,</li>
    <li> These earring are described as sterling silver, but are not stamped with any international sterling silver mark and come with no documentation of their material makeup. I also did not realize that the actual post that goes through the ear would not be made of metal; it is instead made of some clear material. Overall: cheaply made, not as described, wouldn&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> Really nice and was worth the price</li>
    <li> An earring collection in a box.  These items are a good deal.</li>
    <li> very good item, shipped quickly too.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves theses lil ear rings.&lt;br /&gt;And i&#x27;m surprised how fast they were delivered.</li>
    <li> My daughter is allergic to everything, and has wore them for a week no problems</li>
    <li> So many selection to choose from and very comfortable to wear and strong.</li>
    <li> Good product my daughter love it, its good silver, excellent.</li>
