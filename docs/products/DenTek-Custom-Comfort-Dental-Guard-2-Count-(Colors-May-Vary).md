      <li>I&#x27;ve been happily using these mouth guards for years.  </li>
      <li>Nonetheless, I successfully made the impression of my teeth and it SEEMED like it should work, but once done, the guard just kept falling out.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a relief to put this in each night - when my teeth are able to have a spongey bed under them instead of pain from clenching.</li>
      <li>so I love to get the 2 pack.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much better than damaging your teeth and jaw by not wearing one.</li>

      <li>Mostly what I found were sports mouth guards that are intended to be worn during an activity.  </li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ll have a better experience.</li>
      <li>Been using dental guards for teeth grinding for many years...</li>
      <li>This my favorite product when it comes to a dental guard.  </li>
      <li>I can used this one, but it&#x27;s not my favorite.</li>
      <li>was better than I could find in stores.</li>
      <li>I gotta tell you, even fitting</li>
      <li>What I found was that if I molded it, within a week, I&#x27;d be hitting the bottom, because the force deepened the bite more and more as the grind wore on.  </li>
      <li>These seem to be made for your top teeth, but with a pair of scissors I cut off part of the area that would go over the gum and made them for my bottom</li>
      <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
      <li>I figured it&#x27;s better than nothing.  </li>
      <li>I was pleasantly pleased with the quality.  </li>
      <li>But what most disturbs me is the price increase.</li>
      <li>Oh - one more</li>
      <li>the Amazon price is a better bargain.  </li>
      <li>I love these</li>
      <li>It is very easy to custom fit.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to fit and very comfortable</li>
      <li>This is the most comfortable nightguard I have ever used.</li>
      <li>this is probably the most comfortable set</li>
      <li>These are the most comfortable to wear, however, I do end up chewing these up quicker than I would like.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s comfortable to use; what&#x27;s more to expect?</li>
      <li>Easy to sleep with, does not disturb sleep.  </li>
      <li>Easy to form and get use to.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to mold and fits well.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>Easy to use, no off flavors from the plastic.  </li>
      <li>However, I would still recommend it because it is affordable and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I find them to be easy to mold and they serve their purpose fine.  </li>
      <li>If someone one has perfect teeth and an average size jaw, this *might* be an option.</li>
      <li>They are comfortable and easy to mould.  </li>
      <li>Night guard was easy to custom fit.</li>
      <li>The nightguards are fine.  </li>
      <li>Easy to fit and uses.</li>
      <li>easy to fit and works well.</li>
      <li>it seemed like it would be fine, but it just kept falling off/out.</li>
      <li>I love the bottom plastic helps to keep it from falling apart quickly</li>
      <li>However, I can say that this is reasonably comfortable and fairly easy to fit.  </li>
      <li>but I do expect sellers on Amazon to show accurate images.  </li>
      <li>So you go to sleep every night with a huge block of rubber in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is comfortable.</li>
      <li>I have been using this dental guard for years -- they seem to last about 6 months, so by getting 2 in the pack it is really a great deal.  </li>
      <li>When boiled it doesn&#x27;t fit to the teeth</li>
      <li>but the fact that it fits comfortably makes all the difference.</li>
      <li>But until I find one that is just as comfortable to wear, I will probably continue with these.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t ever fit my rack.</li>
      <li>Since moving to the country, away from my great dentist, I started using OTC guards when the custom one finally wore out.  </li>
      <li>The DenTek Custom Comfort Dental Guard is comfortable and can be formed around all of your teeth.</li>
      <li>Too bulky for comfortable sleeping.</li>
      <li>This guard lasts the longest (about a month tops for me) and is comfortable while I sleep.</li>
      <li>This product is great overall.</li>
      <li>It does fit snugly and has not fallen out during the night</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had professionally made grinding guards before and wanted to try these to see if they were any good.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After two attempts (with one guard; the 2nd one you receive is supposed to be the \\&quot;bonus\\&quot;), I successfully made the impression of my teeth (boil and fit).</li>
      <li>This exact product is my favorite</li>
      <li>As I&#x27;m more of a \\&quot;clencher\\&quot; I didn&#x27;t expect that to be too much of a problem.  </li>
      <li>You might say that the mouth is full of saliva all the time, but wearing the guard it was literally accumulating saliva and retaining it.</li>
      <li>They are a good value in a two pack, that the vendor says should last a year.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s in a good middle ground.</li>
      <li>I was fine with the clear ones, but it sounds like many people were not.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Follow the directions and it works with no problems. The price is worth waiting for the shipping. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like these Guards because they work, and I can cut them in half to make them more comfortable, and they last like four months.</li>
    <li> I have tried almost every over the counter mouth guard that&#x27;s out there. I would actually like this one if the material didn&#x27;t break down so quickly. Be sure to save your receipt because I think the \\&quot;guaranteed 1 year protection\\&quot; is like a rebate -it&#x27;s a bluff they hope you don&#x27;t call. Seriously, both mouth guards in the two-pack lasted less than two months before the material (I had the blue Custom Comforts) breaks down. After a few weeks, I had a lot of precariously hanging chunks that you either have to rip off or hope you don&#x27;t swallow in your sleep.  The good is that this is reasonably low profile and stays in contact with front and rear teeth, which my dentist recommended since he said the back pad night guard versions can affect your bite over time. If there was a stronger material that didn&#x27;t break down so quickly, I would love this guard. Since that is not the case, the \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; acrylic night guard I can get at my dentist ends up being a better long term investment.</li>
    <li> In local drugstore these cost $25, so two for &amp;lt;$20 is real bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discard and replace every six months, prevents long term germ build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After each use, wash hands, rinse it with few drops of listerene, hold under a running water faucet, dry a few seconds with a pistol hair dryer, place in case, and the case on a kitchen saucer, replacing saucer with clean one after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is a easy one minute way to keep it dry and sanitary without going crazy with an overkill electric ultraviolet dehumidifier.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a stop-gap while I wait for my custom-molded guard to come back to my dentist&#x27;s office. I attempted to use this, but it won&#x27;t mold to my teeth: The front is too thin to accommodate my teeth, the back is too wide and extends too far past my molars (I have a small jaw), and I can&#x27;t mold it at all around one super-erupted molar I have.     If someone one has perfect teeth and an average size jaw, this *might* be an option. But, if you have imperfect teeth -- which is likely if you actually need a mouth guard -- this isn&#x27;t likely to mold to your teeth well at all.     The only good thing I can say for the product is that it comes with a money back guarantee. I&#x27;m mailing the form tonight.</li>
    <li> bought this because I am grinding my teeth really bad. I ordered one for the dentist for over $300 dollars but I need something for the next two weeks. It is way to thick and does not fit right. I had to shape it twice and thats the max you can shape this mouth guard. I will try using it tonight for the first time and if its that bad I will attempt to make it again with the second one. I would not but this again, maybe the more expensive one is better or if you really need one that will last forever see your dentist but be ready to spend big bucks.</li>
    <li> My dentist told me some time ago that I was grinding my teeth and/or clenching my jaw in my sleep. I didn&#x27;t believe him until a portion of my lower front tooth first appeared opaque and then broke off one day when I was eating a corn chip.     After getting the tooth repaired, I looked online for a night guard. I was hestitant to purchase this because some folks said that they bit through the device. I&#x27;m not sure now how that would be possible. I purchased this set locally for $29.99 in the sake of time. I would purchase online next time for huge cost savings.    Night guard was easy to custom fit. It stays in my mouth. I do awaken a couple of times a night when I feel the night guard. I think this must be when I have started clenching or grinding. Hopefully this new awareness will break me of the habit. If not, this solution is certainly easy to live with.</li>
    <li> Having never tried any other nightguard product I can&#x27;t really compare to say if this is better than any others.  However, I can say that this is reasonably comfortable and fairly easy to fit.  Yes you will notice that there is a bulky piece of plastic in your mouth but if you&#x27;ve fit it correctly it really shouldn&#x27;t bother you any.  The product itself is well built and provides adequate protection, there is no way any human could ever bite through the harder (yet plyable and soft) plastic this is made from.    A word of advise, you do not get much time to actually mold the product to your teeth/mouth before it starts to harden again so be prepared to be quick after you take it out of the water.</li>
    <li> If you actually receive the blue DenTek nightguards that are pictured, I would give them a 5 star product rating (I have purchased them before from Walgreens and was quite satisfied).  However, despite ordering from this very link, I received a set of all clear DenTek nightguards, which are bulky and uncomfortable, which deserve only one star.  Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> The nightguard I purchased is blue with a clear base. I bought a set of two for [...] at Walgreens. According to a Dentek video on [...], the nightguard I purchased has been replace by a new design, which is clear. I have bruxism and have never used a mouthguard before. I find it a bulky, but it stays in my mouth at night. I plan on trying the new design when these wear out.</li>
    <li> I used to have a $700 custom night guard from my dentist that fit perfectly and lasted 7 years. Since moving to the country, away from my great dentist, I started using OTC guards when the custom one finally wore out.  This brand works well -- they run about $10 each and are comfortable enough to use all the time. NOTE, they are not completely smooth inside. The guard is constructed of two types of plastic and the ridge between those two types of plastic is noticeable. I am hyper-sensitive to such tiny differences, so it took me a little while to get used to it. They last 4-6 months for me.</li>
    <li> These are not the blue type as pictured.  It also did not include the case.  I will be returning them.</li>
    <li> For anyone considering purchasing this item, be aware that Amazon is no longer stocking the blue-colored nightguards as pictured here. Instead, they substitute the clear ones, which are of an inferior quality and simply do not last as long. I didn&#x27;t receive any communication from Amazon, either on the product page or in subsequent e-mails, regarding this substitution. I&#x27;ve already printed the return label and will send these back for a refund ASAP.</li>
    <li> I used to have the old blue version and loved it.  Even my dentist was impressed by it.  The clear one is like a football mouth guard.  When boiled it doesn&#x27;t fit to the teeth well and its super thick.  Also it is short.  It doesn&#x27;t reach to my back molars.  When I wake up in the morning after wearing this my teeth feel misaligned and my jaw is sore.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Hurts to wear. Highly recommend spending money to get from a dentist. I am so glad I did.</li>
    <li> I am currently using a Dentek nightguard that looks like the blue, bendable item currently (June 19, 2010) pictured on this web page. However when I ordered this item from Amazon, I received a clear plain rim nightguard with no bend points or front support. I like my current blue model and will return these clear ones (Amazon is great for returns). The clear plain rims from other manufacturers are bulky and uncomfortable in my mouth. However I&#x27;m wondering if Dentek no longer makes the blue model -- their own web site does not display it. If true it&#x27;s too bad.</li>
    <li> I have been buying these guards at Walgreens- the Amazon price is a better bargain.  They do not last me 6 months, so I guess I really grind my teeth.  But they are superior in comfort and strength to two other guards I have tried. I also had an expensive custom-made guard from a dentist that was so hard and uncomfortable I never wore it.  It probably would have lasted forever, but to work you have to be willing to have the thing in your mouth all night.  When fit properly, this guard is not uncomfortable once you get used to something in your mouth all night. You only wear one of them, on your top teeth.  The other is a spare to use when the first needs replacing.  The guards consist of a hard, but flexible outer layer and a softer layer that melts when heated and forms around your teeth to hold it in place all night.  I have bought some guards that do not have the outer, harder layer and they shred very quickly.  I have never had one of these that had a tear or break in the outer shell, but the softer part eventually breaks apart and then it is time to replace it.  You can&#x27;t get the guard too hot when you clean it, or it will melt out of the shape that fits your mouth. So I usually run it under cold water while I brush my teeth, then I brush the guard with the toothbrush and turn it over to air dry till I need it again.  Mouthwash works on them too, although it discolors them.  All in all, it saves me wearing down my teeth from grinding so it is a bargain even at a higher price.  Update, January 2012:  As others have stated, the blue colored mouth guards have returned.  I was fine with the clear ones, but it sounds like many people were not.  I have started to form both guards at the same time recently, because I find the boiling, counting seconds, forming process tedious.  I make one, then while I still have the boiling water, I make the next one so it is ready when the first one is looking worn inside. Have been using these for two years now, and am quite happywith them.  Use subscribe and save for an even better price!</li>
    <li> While I have used this guard for a few years (because it&#x27;s small and doesn&#x27;t gag me), the price has gone from $22 on Amazon to now $79.99! I have written to Amazon to complain and also to Dentek. It is $18 in Walmart and $29.99 in Kmart---IF YOU CAN EVER FIND IT IN STOCK. It&#x27;s true that it doesn&#x27;t last for six months. But what most disturbs me is the price increase. I have switched to another brand (Oral B) which I doubt will last six weeks! The others are just too big and bulky and make me gag.</li>
    <li> I use this product because I have an underbite and my jaw aches if while sleeping, my lower teeth push out beyond my upper teeth, so this keeps me comfortable while sleeping.</li>
    <li> I loved the Den Tek model that I bought a year or so ago, it was blue, like this, but shaped slightly different. This one has a &amp;#34;v&amp;#34; shaped section in the front that actually is pretty annoying. The older model was solid. I can used this one, but it&#x27;s not my favorite. I would really prefer the other model.</li>
    <li> I have a mouth guard from my dentist that I&#x27;d been using way too long; it&#x27;s discolored and looks worn and, well, kind of gross.  I started looking around at alternatives to the dentist since those are very expensive.  Mostly what I found were sports mouth guards that are intended to be worn during an activity.  I recommend you avoid those for night guard use.  When I found these in the pharmacy aisle of the store I was intrigued.  They were kind of pricy, around $20 for a two pack, but that was hundreds less than the one from the dentist.  Right off the bat, these are no where near the quality of what you get from a dentist.  They are made of a soft gummy upper portion and a harder tray under that that holds the gummy piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical, expecting the \\&quot;molding\\&quot; process where you soak it in hot water, to produce the usual change that is barely perceptible (as on the sports mouth guards).  To my surprise and delight, the gummy gel was quite soft and molded to my teeth very well.  The mouth guard is a little off on size to me, so my tooth impression is toward the inside edge of the guard and not right in the middle where it would be optimal. This does not seem to be a problem though so far.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for about a week now and it seems pretty comfortable.  It does fit snugly and has not fallen out during the night, it&#x27;s always in place over my teeth in the morning.  The imprints are so deep and faceted that it makes it a bit challenging to clean properly, but this is because the material is so soft, a good compromise in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I&#x27;m reviewing the clear version of these, I&#x27;ve never seen the blue ones.  Mine came with two in the package and I plan to use the other one when the first wears out, after which I&#x27;ll be looking for the blue ones to try out.  According to the instructions you can reshape the dental guard two times in hot water, so you have one chance after a screw up to make it fit.  I guess that&#x27;s reasonable as well,given the fact that you want something that&#x27;s going to hold it&#x27;s shape after molding.  The seam between the upper gummy portion and lower tray part does not bother me when wearing it, the only drawback being that it&#x27;s another place you&#x27;ll need to make sure you clean well so germs don&#x27;t build up there.  The harder tray portion is flexible, so it&#x27;s not uncomfortable in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s not as good as what you get from a dentist, but for the price it&#x27;s very good.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking for a night guard.  It&#x27;s much better than damaging your teeth and jaw by not wearing one.</li>
    <li> I still waiting for my order yet.&lt;br /&gt;I made my order in April 12, i do not recibe anything&lt;br /&gt;send to me my package,  or return my money.  Please</li>
    <li> Product performs just as well as advertised. No surprises. I would recommend it. Have tried competing products and none are&lt;br /&gt;better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous night guards including a couple fitted by a dentist.  These are the most comfortable to wear, however, I do end up chewing these up quicker than I would like.  They are a good value in a two pack, that the vendor says should last a year.  I&#x27;m lucky to have them both last 5-6 months.  But until I find one that is just as comfortable to wear, I will probably continue with these.</li>
    <li> Was I purchased was a dental device to aide in my snoring.  What I received was a product meant for persons who grinding their teeth while sleeping.  A huge disappointment!!</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended that I use a product of this type to prevent bruxism (teeth grinding) while sleeping. It works great for that, and also helps prevent snoring and apnea.</li>
    <li> Excellent guard.  Easy to sleep with, does not disturb sleep.  Does not fall out during night.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> My wife uses these as she grinds her teeth, she goes through one every 4 months or so (yes they wear out as they are designed) they work like a champ and cost much less than the ones the dentist sells.</li>
    <li> The DenTek Custom Comfort Dental Guard is comfortable and can be formed around all of your teeth. The only thing that I didnt know is that it is for your upper teeth and would prefer a bottom teeth guard. Overall, I like this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using DenTek dental guards for about 3 years now, and they have consistently gotten smaller and smaller, while getting more and more expensive. Their older guards completely surrounded your teeth and produced a snug, encompassing fit, and would last me up to about 3 months with regular cleaning. With each new order I&#x27;m disappointed to see less plastic around the rim, and less of the blue malleable substance within. The result is a product that feels &amp;#34;cheap,&amp;#34; and lasts only a few weeks before having to be replaced. All that said... I have not found a product from another company that works any better, so I&#x27;m likely stuck buying these duds for the time being.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;sleep grinder&amp;#34;, and have caused damage to some teeth (real and capped).  This product works great.  The dentist would have made one for over $150.  I&#x27;ve found this to be effective and much more affordable.  Recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to fit and very comfortable but I chewed through the blue part in two nights. I can&#x27;t wear this without ending up with bits of blue plastic everywhere in my mouth. The bottom plastic is so hard I&#x27;m concerned about grinding wear on my lower teeth.</li>
    <li> This is a warning against using any night guard which molds to your molars. Well, this particular guard did keep me from grinding my teeth. Problem is, within six months of wearing it, and at my next dental check-up, doc said he found a cavity on one of my upper molars. Right where the guard goes. My dental hygiene has not changed in 25 years... still good there, because I&#x27;d been cavity-free for all those years. No dietary change, or any other culprits. One of the first things I noticed when I began wearing this was all the saliva that gets caught between the teeth and guard, and was constantly sucking it out while the guard was in my mouth, until I got use to that feeling. In the six months since I wore the guard and got my first cavity in 25 years, the only change was the night guard. My gut says that the only cuplrit is the guard trapping acidic saliva in the area between the teeth and guard material, and basically soaking the tooth surface in acidic saliva for eight hours a night. The guard certainly did accumulate a whitish deposit right where the teeth conform to, in spite of daily cleaning. You might say that the mouth is full of saliva all the time, but wearing the guard it was literally accumulating saliva and retaining it. The instructions for similar night guards warn not to use them if you have an unfilled cavity. I assume that if they can aggravate an existing cavity, then they likely can also accelerate the formation of cavities. I am going to try one of the \\&quot;wing\\&quot; bite guards instead. Won&#x27;t use another one of tehse tightly form-fitted guards ever again.</li>
    <li> This my favorite product when it comes to a dental guard.  Unfortunately the price keeps going way up for some reason and I will not buy it for this price.</li>
    <li> Out of all the different mouth guards I&#x27;ve used this is the one I keep coming back to because it fits in and stays in my mouth. It&#x27;s not the cheapest and it&#x27;s not the most expensive but it&#x27;s in a good middle ground. It&#x27;s not incredibly strong (during high-stress times I&#x27;ve gone through 2 of these badboys in under 2 months) but the fact that it fits comfortably makes all the difference.</li>
    <li> This product is great overall. It is very easy to custom fit. It is comfortable. It does the job. The only problem is that I have not found that it lasts more than a few months. It sure doesn&#x27;t last any where near one year, as advertised. However, I would still recommend it because it is affordable and easy to use. Most of all, it is super comfortable and even if it doesn&#x27;t last long enough, it does seem to do the job.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I was looking for...</li>
    <li> I only buy this mouthguard. I have tried quite a few and they normally fall apart in a month. These last forever! Definitely worth the price. Thanks!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a relief to put this in each night - when my teeth are able to have a spongey bed under them instead of pain from clenching. Mine only last about 3 months so I love to get the 2 pack.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand/style for a few years now. My local stores have stopped carrying this style for some reason. The last two times I purchased this brand at my local store, the dental guard was really small and didn&#x27;t even cover my back teeth (where I do my grinding). I get about four months or so use out of each one. Compared to the price I would have to pay a dentist for one, it&#x27;s a great deal. I&#x27;ve had a professional one before and I ended up chewing through it within six months.</li>
    <li> As advertised.  Rapid delivery by seller.  A+++</li>
    <li> I had to trim the back so it would fit. It works like it should. I have been using this kind for about two years know I really like the way they keep me from grinding my teeth.</li>
    <li> I got the Dentek mouthguard for a sudden change in my sleeping patterns, and noticed that I started grinding my teeth.  They are hugely insanely expensive.  $20 for two is a lot for me.  Especially since I don&#x27;t want to spend $20 a month for these, and I&#x27;m having a hard time wanting to keep these in my mouth for a year.  Mine came with the case, and the refills are still $20.  I think we are all being over charged for this product.  However, few products compare to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first it is like what the other reviewers claim.  Bulky.  I went ahead, and forced myself to accept the initial discomfort.  Amazingly it does help with the teeth grinding.  Over time, the plastic will mold to your teeth naturally as your bite moulds the plastic just like boiling.  I tried boiled and regular.  What I found was that if I molded it, within a week, I&#x27;d be hitting the bottom, because the force deepened the bite more and more as the grind wore on.  However, boil them again, you might be able to squeeze them back into a usable form.  But the plastic doesn&#x27;t shape together.  it just forms a clump of separated pieces that harden.  Which is sad, you should be able to reform the plastic in the boil process, one would only hope.  But reusing them, I&#x27;m very afraid of bacteria wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I purchased this item the second time they had not updated the photo.  Now they are sending out the blue ones to me, but others are commenting they didn&#x27;t get the blue version.  Maybe I could have exchanged with them.  The blue ones are awful.  For me I cannot stand tooth shields on the outer rims.  it doesn&#x27;t ever fit my rack.</li>
    <li> Well, I just used the product and its so thick that it made me gag a little. I gave it two stars because the molding part was easy enough. Im looking into buying a new mouth guard.</li>
    <li> I am changing this review some because back when I wrote it, Amazon was selling the clear ones which were bulkier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was searching for the blue ones at that time becauseI had a blue Dentek night guard that was getting in really bad shape.  When I looked for more, they were gone and they were selling the clear blobs.  The clear ones are like most of the other brands and, as most people have written here, big and bulky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of August 2011, Dentek has been selling the thin blue ones again.  I finally got a new one the other night and plan to go and buy the rest on the shelf at my local Walmart so they will restock them.  I guess Dentek got contacted by a lot of people.  When I contacted them, I was told they redesigned them.  I didn&#x27;t notice anything redesigned, but the design is the best out there.  You can now find these blue ones again and I have been using them for years.  They are the best of all I tried.</li>
    <li> I have an extremely small mouth, and I have gone through several other bruxism guards with very unhappy results.  These looked a little narrower, so I took a gamble on the newer blue version.  I have been using one for nearly two weeks now.  I had to trim off the ends so the ends come to the middle of my back molars--if it went any further back, my mouth would be held open.  Other than that, it was easy to fit and feels much more comfortable than any other guard I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the first night, the guard did not bother me at all, aside from a little gum irritation the next day.  No subsequent gum irritation, but I will update this review after a couple months.  I don&#x27;t know how hard a grinder I am, and I am very curious about durability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four stars rather than five simply because I don&#x27;t think two weeks is sufficient time for a solid 5-star review.  I&#x27;m also waiting for a verdict from the dentist after my next check-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...Updating after having used one guard for well over six months.  I am still very happy with it, no signs of falling apart and no discomfort.</li>
    <li> I love the blue version of this night guard. It&#x27;s easy to mold, it fits perfect over my teeth and it doesn&#x27;t feel bulky. The only major problem is that it doesn&#x27;t last long at all. Dentek says that each guard will last approximately 6 months, but I chew through one within 2 months and end up having to keep on buying them constantly. I wish that they would make their night guards more durable or sell them for cheaper since they don&#x27;t last for the 6 months that they guarantee.</li>
    <li> Been using dental guards for teeth grinding for many years... this is probably the most comfortable set I&#x27;ve ever worn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main thing about it is that it is very lightweight - most other dental guards are closer to sports mouthguard types and have way more rubbed than needed to protect your teeth. So you go to sleep every night with a huge block of rubber in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with two in the package. One downside is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a plastic case to store them in. Chances are if you&#x27;ve worn these before you&#x27;ll have an extra spare case lying around, but it&#x27;s somethign to consider.</li>
    <li> Too bulky for comfortable sleeping. Plan to try one that is smaller or thinner material. Value was good and it does prevent teeth grinding.</li>
    <li> The nightguards are fine.  I find them to be easy to mold and they serve their purpose fine.  My reason for giving 3 stars instead of 4 or 5, is that the image shows 2 nightguards + a bonus storage case.  Mine did not come with the storage case.  A small thing to whine about, but I do expect sellers on Amazon to show accurate images.  And waaahhhh, I really did want that darn storage case!</li>
    <li> My second set. The other lasted 5 plus years. Wife spent over $700 for a night guard at her dentist. I feel this one works just as well.</li>
    <li> I was made because they had a different photo which was miss leasing and I thought I was getting what was in the photo.</li>
    <li> I like this product and the price was better than I could find in stores. I will order this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had professionally made grinding guards before and wanted to try these to see if they were any good.  They are!  They are comfortable and easy to mould.  I wear it on my lower teeth and its very comfortable.</li>
    <li> This product does what it&#x27;s supposed to at a reasonable price.  The instructions are clear and easy to set up.  Hey, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to and it&#x27;s comfortable to use; what&#x27;s more to expect?</li>
    <li> This is a very good product at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to mold and fits well.&lt;br /&gt;Also the free case that comes in the two pack is good for travel.</li>
    <li> I bought these a few years ago and used one while under extreme stress as advised by my dentist. It far exceeded all my expectations! Easy to form and get use to. The best on the market as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
    <li> Item pictured is not item shipped..still waiting for the correct item to ship ! Been over 2 wweks now ~</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t last nearly as long as they claim, but they are pretty comfortable for a &amp;#34;boil&amp;#34; mouthguard. Don&#x27;t expect to get anything close to a year out of it though lol</li>
    <li> This is the most comfortable nightguard I have ever used. In fact, it&#x27;s the only nightguard I can use without feeling like I&#x27;m chewing on a giant hockey puck. However, you MUST be a person who is a light grinder, meaning you tend to chew from side to side instead of biting hard while sleeping. If you&#x27;re one of the latter types, this is not the nightguard for you as you will chew through it in a month or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One way to determine which type you are is whether your jaw muscles are sore when you wake up. If so, you&#x27;re probably going to need to find a different nightguard. This is why the claims tend to range from people who love it (like me) to people who easily chew through it and give it bad rankings.</li>
    <li> I recently lost my dentist made teeth guard and was looking at another option. This blue model is certainly cheap enough, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. These seem to be made for your top teeth, but with a pair of scissors I cut off part of the area that would go over the gum and made them for my bottom teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I slept through the night with the guard, although I can definitely tell that they are thicker than the professional ones.&lt;br /&gt;If you are sensitive to a thicker guard these might not be right for you.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re ok for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not the BEST option, but it&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also trying [[ASIN:B0042UAZCM Professional Custom Soft Dental Teeth Night Guard Order Dental Lab Direct!]], and will report on those when they are made.&lt;br /&gt;They do go on sale for around $55 so you can wait if you want.</li>
    <li> Used to like these guards.  But after them only lasting a month and a half tops, I had to switch to something better. Got the Prodental mouth Guards, and I love them!</li>
    <li> These are the blue ones. Easy to fit and each will last 4 to 6 months before falling apart. Price has gone up in the last year.</li>
    <li> Best boil guard I have found yet. Others are so flimsy so I wake up with tooth and jaw pain. Plus it seems to have less toxins. I keep searching for a non-toxic all natural guard that doesn&#x27;t increase estrogen in the body. Why is that too much to ask?????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con is that it lasts a month then breaks down. Maybe it means that it has less plastic polymer and therefore is more biodegradable. One can only hope!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been happily using these mouth guards for years.  The current ones are lots thinner than previous guards.  That&#x27;s in no way an improvement, and I have to suspect someone &amp;#34;cost-improved&amp;#34; the product by using less material.</li>
    <li> Outer packaging was in good condition. Inner packages are yellowed and beat up. One set of blue night guards, one set of clear, description does say color may vary, so that was ok. I have no idea how old thee things are, but I would guess at least 5 years, probably 7-10 based on the package yellowing. Not something I want to put in my mouth.</li>
    <li> What I received was a single mouth guard with a case, not what I ordered, and way too expensive for one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  The seller contacted me the same day I emailed them and is sending the correct product out to me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought several of these in the past to prevent nighttime teeth grinding.  These, however, were a disappointment.  Dentek, apparently to save money, has made the tooth bed narrower, which has it slipping off the teeth and into my mouth during the night.  If they go back to the wider tooth pad I&#x27;ll re-buy, if not I won&#x27;t..</li>
    <li> I bought the blue bite guards with the clear bottoms.  I think it would work great if you don&#x27;t clench your teeth really hard.  I guess I do because my molars tore apart two of these guard in about a month and a half.  One guard is supposed to last 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t really like the flat bottom.  Sometimes, my teeth points were a little sore in the morning from my heavy clenching against the flat plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just FYI (because I couldn&#x27;t find this info anywhere): the total length of the guard is 5.5 inches (measured the outside edge).</li>
    <li> I bought these hoping they would fit well and not be too big and bulky.  I was pleasantly pleased with the quality.  I received the blue ones.  I clench my jaws and grind my teeth, so I have to have something I won&#x27;t bite through.  Work great for me!</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and it seemed that the negative ones were mostly focused on the clear version of this product which evidently was being shipped for a time. I received the blue one. The other complaint that frequently was mentioned was that these wore out quickly.  As I&#x27;m more of a \\&quot;clencher\\&quot; I didn&#x27;t expect that to be too much of a problem.  When I got the product, I carefully read &amp; followed the instructions.  I gotta tell you, even fitting this was making me gag but I must be at the more sensitive end of the gag reflex spectrum.  Nonetheless, I successfully made the impression of my teeth and it SEEMED like it should work, but once done, the guard just kept falling out. It wouldn&#x27;t stay in place on my teeth, defeating the purpose.  Sizewise, it was difficult to shut my mouth with this in place so I really can&#x27;t say how I would have fared sleeping with the guard on had I actually been able to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve uploaded a photo of my guard with the impression which isn&#x27;t the clearest, but as I write this, there is no other photo of a finished product, so I figured it&#x27;s better than nothing.  Oh - one more thing - per the instructions, the guard (and the spare) is intended for upper teeth only.</li>
    <li> I love these they work well &amp; last a long time unlike others. I love the bottom plastic helps to keep it from falling apart quickly</li>
    <li> I have been using this dental guard for years -- they seem to last about 6 months, so by getting 2 in the pack it is really a great deal.  Sometimes they are hard to find in stores so Amazon is a great place to buy it. Yes, I have a bad grinding problem also- this brand works great for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item online to save my money and my teeth but every time I got to bed with it on. I have trouble getting to sleep since it partial blocks you from breathing out your mouth. When I do fall asleep I 9 times out of 10 wake up with it no longer in my mouth. So not really effective. I am going to try and fit the second guard but if it fails too this was a waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> worked perfect. can&#x27;t believe how much cheaper this was then the dentist ones. still on my first guard, haven&#x27;t even used the extra...</li>
    <li> Thank goodness I&#x27;m no longer grinding my teeth down to nubs.</li>
    <li> easy to fit and works well. Only lasts about 2 months so you may want to stock up on a few.</li>
    <li> I found that when I wore them I spent all night chewing and that gave me worse headaches then when I did not wear them.&lt;br /&gt;Prob not a product flaw.</li>
    <li> As a sleeping tooth grinder, I was very sad that Target and Rite Aid stopped carrying this product in their stores. They have a very inferior nighguard line instead. Thanks to Drugstore.Com for carrying this product. I am happy to find it again. Its a great product for me and will hopefully keep me from grinding my teeeth to nubs!</li>
    <li> Easy to fit and uses. Works wonderfully! I have used several kinds of bite guards and this is definitely one I recommend.</li>
    <li> Very good night guards. Helps me from grinding at night. Would reccomend buying again when others have been worn out.</li>
    <li> I grind my front(and I think clench) teeth. To the point where my bottom four&#x27;ish front teeth are now forming a nice little *valley* as well as getting flattened. My dentist recommended a night guard. My insurance didn&#x27;t cover it. The cost is $450.00 I opted to try the over the counter ones. This was my third and final try, to no avail. They are all horrible. I read all the reviews and it seemed that the negative ones were mostly for the clear version of this product, not the blue ones. I received the blue ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two attempts (with one guard; the 2nd one you receive is supposed to be the \\&quot;bonus\\&quot;), I successfully made the impression of my teeth (boil and fit). The first time, the guard kept falling off. This guard to be worn on your top teeth and covers the entire set of teeth to the back molars. Not to extend past the back molars (you actually cut, trim, fit the guard first ~ before boiling ~ to enure it&#x27;s the proper length)and it seemed like it would be fine, but it just kept falling off/out. The instructions state you can boil/fit the guard two times. If it doesn&#x27;t work, you need to use your \\&quot;bonus\\&quot; guard. The second time, it worked. I wore it to bed the first night. It was quite bulky and I couldn&#x27;t close my mouth all the way. When I woke up and took the guard out, my teeth felt weird...almost like they shifted. Sort of numb. It&#x27;s a very hard feeling to describe. It went away after a couple of hours. The second night, I kind of adjusted how I closed my mouth (to a more comfortable position). I woke up at 4:30 in the morning with SEVERE JAW PAIN. The hinge area of my jaw (on the top) was extremely painful and it felt like I wouldn&#x27;t be able to open and close my mouth. I kept moving my jaw thinking it would subside. It didn&#x27;t. For nearly two hours. Finally, all the pain/discomfort was gone ~ nearly half the day was spent like this. I can&#x27;t say that I recommend this guard. I&#x27;m going to suck it up and spend the money on the guard from my dentist. Hopefully, I&#x27;ll have a better experience.fully, I&#x27;ll have a better experience.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, no off flavors from the plastic.  Solves headaches related to night grinding at about 1/4 the cost of a custom made night guard from a dentist&#x27;s office.  I wish my local store still carried it.  Bless Amazon for still having it.</li>
    <li> I grind my teeth a lot in my sleep. I HAVE TO wear a mouth guard or I&#x27;ll eat my teeth. This exact product is my favorite and I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores when I moved down to Tampa. Thankfully I found it on Amazon. This guard lasts the longest (about a month tops for me) and is comfortable while I sleep.</li>
    <li> I liked these because they are small and unobtrusive. But they didn&#x27;t last that long and wore out quickly. Also I have few back molars due to a wisdom tooth issue in my youth, so they tended to dig into my gums.</li>
</ol>
