### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>There are photographs, interviews, meeting a lot of people I&#x27;d like to look my best for.</li>
      <li>What is so wonderful about it is that people can&#x27;t figure out what you have done!</li>
      <li>Too scared of face lift and this works perfectly....</li>
      <li>Both products are great!!</li>
      <li>This is the best look i&#x27;ve ever had since I used it...</li>
      <li>Very good at holing my skin up</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t stick very good</li>
      <li>Good luck and give them a try!</li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>Again good concept just think it needs application improvements.  </li>
      <li>Nothing more than a box of 12 bandaids!</li>
      <li>I am use to doing my own hair and makeup and applying beauty products, that using this product was a no brainer.</li>
      <li>I am delighted with the bands and have so much more confidence when wearing them.  </li>
      <li>The seller was fast and great to deal with!!</li>
      <li>,  Wothout those Lifts, I truly felt I might as well just turn around and go home, so great was my dependence on the significant appearance-booster of the Lifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Even then, the lift was not as good as with the original.</li>
      <li>The tape is nice and strong and it lasts me two days.</li>
      <li>I really Love Love it...</li>
      <li>In fact I almost hesitate to write these details as I can&#x27;t believe that level of responsiveness is &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;, But you can be sure  </li>
      <li>But I just LOVE them for a night out!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Great product, even greater customer service.</li>
      <li>I forget it is on and have had more compliments.</li>
      <li>The Final Exam was when I wore them around the house for a day and night, and my husband thought I &amp;#34;looked great today&amp;#34; (said so), yet never detected the Lifts!</li>
      <li>Love what these do for me.</li>
      <li>plus they are more comfortable!</li>
      <li>Be sure to order the &amp;#34; PRO&amp;#34; product.</li>
      <li>WORTH IT!!</li>
      <li>I love it and it easy to use.</li>
      <li>Love product but does break easily.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad there is something like this available, because a surgeon would have been seeing me soon.</li>
      <li>This is as easy as putting on a headband.</li>
      <li>Smoother less lines and a great boost to my ego!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll reorder probably 4 times a year!!!</li>
      <li>It has taken 10 years off my neckline and I feel great, and feel younger now wearing these tapes.</li>
      <li>Amazing and so much easier</li>
      <li>You must use alcohol swab to clean all oil from attachment area and hands.  </li>
      <li>I also use a Q-tip with rubbing alcohol and clean the area the tape will go.</li>
      <li>and wow, they are so happy, has to be done right, but it makes a youthful difference and ship is super fast on Amazon</li>
      <li>Great idea because other potions and lotions do not work.</li>
      <li>I am giving it four stars as the concept is great, however the application is less than user friendly.</li>
      <li>I regained my confidence since then and felt so lucky to find this product....</li>
      <li>I will be getting my Lifts delivered to me in my hotel in time for my first important appearance .&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product is good for the winter months but the attachments do not hold long it the summer months with the heat causing perspiration.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fast easy and does the job.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They were an unmitigated success.</li>
      <li>Best secret ever and works on darker skin complexions.</li>
      <li>I warm it for 15 seconds while it is on my temples and it will last till you remove it.</li>
      <li>I mean, how often do you get a great product, that level of customer responsiveness, and accommodation to your special circumstance?</li>
      <li>If you have a VERY large head, maybe this would work for you....</li>
      <li>I am 51 and still considered attractive, but I was starting to have a problem with a double chin.</li>
      <li>THEN I FORGOT TO PACK THEM ON MY CROSS COUNTRY TRIP, and found myself Lift-less 3 days from my first important appearance ( a private party for one of my favorite actors!)</li>
      <li>/&gt;They really make a difference !</li>
      <li>(hereafter referred to as the &amp;#34;Lifts&amp;#34;).</li>
      <li>It really lifted my laugh lines - made me feel and</li>
      <li>The only way I could get it to work was to stick on some refill tapes from the original system (which stick great - sometimes a little too well!).</li>
      <li>To make a long story short, everyone (including myself), thought I looked pretty damn good.</li>
      <li>I have been using the original instant facelife for a few years with good results.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t go on for a whole day because I feel no circulation where the tape sticks on my skin</li>
      <li>I tried it and didn&#x27;t see much result</li>
      <li>I suggest you try them all; they are reasonably priced, I think, for the results).  </li>
      <li>I know a lot of competition will be out there, and it well be fresh young faces.</li>
      <li>Very durable bands and</li>
      <li>Does more than what is advertised I spent the money I was going to use on a face-lift to go on vacation</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect success: delivery times tend to be pretty firm, as each vendor has their own standard procedures for fulfillment of orders and I don&#x27;t imagine they like to disrupt their fulfillment</li>
      <li>The Neck lifts were pretty much undetectable unless I wore my hair up high; the face Lifts were placed very close to the ear; lower ear straight across, and upper ear/temple slanted up, both covered with the front of my haircut, which I gelled into place.</li>
      <li>if you place them properly, will last many hours.  </li>
      <li>I give this particular product a 5 star rating.</li>
      <li>I found either Face Lift product worked fine, but I liked the connivence of the Secret Lift Pro,  and tended to use them most of the time (you may prefer the other product however; everyone&#x27;s hair coverage is different.</li>
      <li>honestly they do become a bit uncomfortable after a few hours but you will ook amazing!</li>
      <li>I ordered both the pro and the instant and for my needs which is the neckline, I will be rebuying the original instant, because the band that I attach the tapes to, is nice and tight, so it&#x27;s just easier for me.</li>
      <li>The tape is connected via a thin flimsy plastic strip that is NOT adjustable, and it BREAKS very easily!</li>
      <li>Secret Lift Pro is a good product, but you have  learn how to use it, because, it takes time to put on.</li>
      <li>I should have known that if it sounds to good to be true it usually is and their are no easy fixes - ah the price of vanity.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>However for most I think it&#x27;s probably more frustrating than the minimal results you really achieve.</li>
      <li>They are working for me, so keep an open mind, be patient, watch the utube video and enjoy looking younger</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>The neck was fine but on the face was too tight.</li>
      <li>Was skeptical  this product would would but was pleasantly suprised.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll stick with the old sytem.</li>
      <li>I am 64 years old.</li>
      <li>One friend went so far as to not believe that I did not get a surgical lift that she asked me if I would let her look for  surgical incision.</li>
      <li>Trying to conceal the tape in the position that actually does give you a lift is much easier said than done.</li>
      <li>I think there was to much strap and not enough head for mine to work correctly.</li>
      <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m now 62 years old and thanks to some lucky genetics in facial bone structure, usually came off looking younger than my age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until</li>
      <li>A lot of people surprised that i looked much younger and prettier but didn&#x27;t know what it was?</li>
      <li>but this is by far the coolest,make you look younger product I have ever come across.</li>
      <li>and I developed rash the next day.</li>
      <li>There are also many products that enhance the effects of &#x27;Secret Lift Pro&#x27;.</li>

<li> an unmistakable marker of my true age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have lived with this, unhappily, while I consider surgery which for a variety of reasons, I really want to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> For those of you who may not have seen one up front and personal think of it as a medium width elastic- in a single strip with glue strip on one side and attached at each end a tiny peel off glue square.</li>
<li> as long as you experiment and test them before making your public debut!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> /&gt;However, several tines a year I an in the public eye, as part of a musical group that tours nationally each year, and internationally every few years.</li>
<li> The only draw back for me, is that there are so few in the package, as opposed to having 40 tapes to a pack, with the original Secret Lift.</li>
<li> A pain free alternative to the expensive dermal fillers.</li>
<li> Bands too long.</li>
<li> If you want to make the pro tighter, you can tie knots in the center of the band.</li>
<li> However I really like the Secret Lift Pro.</li>
<li> I wasted several of them before I could figure out how to make it work.</li>

    <li> Nothing more than a box of 12 bandaids!</li>
    <li> It is hard to find the right position of the head to make it work. I wasted several of them before I could figure out how to make it work. I have a small head and it has only one size therefore, it does not work well for me. I can&#x27;t go on for a whole day because I feel no circulation where the tape sticks on my skin and I developed rash the next day.</li>
    <li> Best secret ever and works on darker skin complexions.</li>
    <li> Amazing and so much easier plus they are more comfortable!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product! I decided to go ahead and give it a try. I am 51 and still considered attractive, but I was starting to have a problem with a double chin. I am use to doing my own hair and makeup and applying beauty products, that using this product was a no brainer. It has taken 10 years off my neckline and I feel great, and feel younger now wearing these tapes. The tape is nice and strong and it lasts me two days. I will use them everyday and just make it apart of my morning or evening ritual of getting ready to face the world, oh and without a double chin. Love what these do for me. The seller was fast and great to deal with!! If you want to make the pro tighter, you can tie knots in the center of the band. I ordered both the pro and the instant and for my needs which is the neckline, I will be rebuying the original instant, because the band that I attach the tapes to, is nice and tight, so it&#x27;s just easier for me. Both products are great!! I&#x27;m glad there is something like this available, because a surgeon would have been seeing me soon. Good luck and give them a try! They are working for me, so keep an open mind, be patient, watch the utube video and enjoy looking younger</li>
    <li> I am giving it four stars as the concept is great, however the application is less than user friendly. The instructions/illustrations are confusing. They look like they make sense until you try to follow them. With that said , I required assistance with the face and eye. Trying to conceal the tape in the position that actually does give you a lift is much easier said than done. I have medium just above shoulder length hair and it was almost impossible for the tabs not to show. However it did lift the eyes and cheekbones up a bit. Again good concept just think it needs application improvements.  Now the ones for your &amp;#34;turkey neck&amp;#34; even with assistance I wasted three of them! The concept is to pull the skin from behind and adhere side to side. Dependent upon your hairstyle it is nearly impossible to one, make it actually pull the skin back and second, to find a discreet place for the tabs. Perhaps women with larger heads and I don&#x27;t mean that insultingly, would have simpler ease in using these products merely because the strapping is a one size fits all but in my opinion should be adjustable. I think there was to much strap and not enough head for mine to work correctly. So ladies as I said I see where it can work, just for smaller women can&#x27;t figure a way to modify the strapping size. For those of you who may not have seen one up front and personal think of it as a medium width elastic- in a single strip with glue strip on one side and attached at each end a tiny peel off glue square. Also feel they should note that these would never work for woman with shorter hair because the face and eye one you bury the strap in your hair and the neck one is supposed to go around the nape of your neck and secure behind the ears and you need hair to cover it up. So if you have the head size- a lot of hair, and some patience I would recommend it. However for most I think it&#x27;s probably more frustrating than the minimal results you really achieve.</li>
    <li> it pulled face back but adhesive did not stay.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but they really do work. honestly they do become a bit uncomfortable after a few hours but you will ook amazing!</li>
    <li> Very durable bands and if you place them properly, will last many hours.  I am delighted with the bands and have so much more confidence when wearing them.  I will save thousands of dollars not having to get fillers; the bands average $1 a day, just $365 a year!</li>
    <li> I love it and it easy to use.</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;NOT WORTH IT!!</li>
    <li> Was skeptical  this product would would but was pleasantly suprised. I wore it all day and it didn&#x27;t budge!</li>
    <li> Very good at holing my skin up</li>
    <li> Love product but does break easily.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Look 10 years younger.  You must use alcohol swab to clean all oil from attachment area and hands.  I sometimes leave on for 10 plus hours.  They only come off when I take them off.  Perhaps they are stretched too tight?  I am 64 years old.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t stick very good</li>
    <li> This product wasn&#x27;t make for women of color.</li>
    <li> Bands too long. Returned and haven&#x27;t been credited.</li>
    <li> Another  disaster can I send these back</li>
    <li> What a waste of money - this is the worst product I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon.  It doesn&#x27;t stick for one and it&#x27;s hard to stretch across and by then you hair is stuck to it.  When I finally got one to stick for a minute (after throwing about 5 away) it wrinkled up the skin and hurt.  I should have known that if it sounds to good to be true it usually is and their are no easy fixes - ah the price of vanity.&lt;br /&gt;Also when I looked at the video (before ordering) it showed half the strips being for the face and eye and half the strips being shorter for the chin and neck - I only needed the chin and neck - but when I got these they are only the long strips for the face and eye - my bad for not reading closer I guess.</li>
    <li> I am mid 50&#x27;s. They will not stay on my skin for 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> Giving this item 1 star is a stretch.... If you have a VERY large head, maybe this would work for you.... otherwise, do not invest</li>
    <li> This is the best look i&#x27;ve ever had since I used it...A lot of people surprised that i looked much younger and prettier but didn&#x27;t know what it was? I regained my confidence since then and felt so lucky to find this product....I trimmed the tapes much smaller and that made it unnoticeable...I really Love Love it...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a regular customer for a while. I initially used the original, but switched to the Secret Lift Pro, because of the convenience of it being already assembled. The only draw back for me, is that there are so few in the package, as opposed to having 40 tapes to a pack, with the original Secret Lift. However I really like the Secret Lift Pro.</li>
    <li> I give this particular product a 5 star rating. Be sure to order the &amp;#34; PRO&amp;#34; product. This is as easy as putting on a headband. The lift stays all day. I forget it is on and have had more compliments. One friend went so far as to not believe that I did not get a surgical lift that she asked me if I would let her look for  surgical incision. One trick I found helpful that I discovered is I use a hair dryer on the taped area after It is on. I warm it for 15 seconds while it is on my temples and it will last till you remove it. I also use a Q-tip with rubbing alcohol and clean the area the tape will go. It removes any oil, lotion so the tape sticks xtra well. I am a nurse and I have seen everything....but this is by far the coolest,make you look younger product I have ever come across.</li>
    <li> timely delivery, worked like a charm. It actually shocked me when I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;really did a lift. If you&#x27;re thinking about a facelift, then I suggest trying these&lt;br /&gt;to see what you will look like. I wore it to work all day, they stayed in place&lt;br /&gt;and no one knew I had it on. It really lifted my laugh lines - made me feel and&lt;br /&gt;look 10 years younger.</li>
    <li> That adhesive tape made my skin irritated just after half an hour. It was one piece thing with tapes at the both ends, means it was unable to adjust it. I tried it and didn&#x27;t see much result, it made my skin itchy so had to remove it after 30 minutes</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t wear EVERYDAY But I just LOVE them for a night out!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They really make a difference ! Smoother less lines and a great boost to my ego!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll reorder probably 4 times a year!!!</li>
    <li> Thank you thank you thank you</li>
    <li> Secret Lift Pro is a good product, but you have  learn how to use it, because, it takes time to put on.</li>
    <li> This product is good for the winter months but the attachments do not hold long it the summer months with the heat causing perspiration.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fast easy and does the job.Hope some comes in a shorter length in the future.Great idea because other potions and lotions do not work.</li>
    <li> doesn,t work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;]</li>
    <li> I have been using the original instant facelife for a few years with good results. I tried this out of curiosity, thinking it might be a little easier being one piece. But the tapes do not stick. The only way I could get it to work was to stick on some refill tapes from the original system (which stick great - sometimes a little too well!). Even then, the lift was not as good as with the original. I&#x27;ll stick with the old sytem.</li>
    <li> I use these for my makeup clients..and wow, they are so happy, has to be done right, but it makes a youthful difference and ship is super fast on Amazon</li>
    <li> Does more than what is advertised I spent the money I was going to use on a face-lift to go on vacation</li>
    <li> I was not pleased with this product, sorry I purchased it!</li>
    <li> They are too small need the band to be little longer. The neck was fine but on the face was too tight.</li>
    <li> My vertical mouth lines diminished instantly when Secret Lift Pro strip was applied as directed. A pain free alternative to the expensive dermal fillers. I will continue to purchase this item.</li>
    <li> Too scared of face lift and this works perfectly....</li>
    <li> When I researched this product, I was not aware there was an &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; and a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;. DO NOT PURCHASE THE &amp;#34;NEW&amp;#34;. The tape is connected via a thin flimsy plastic strip that is NOT adjustable, and it BREAKS very easily! This is Junk!!! Sending back. Have already ordered the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; from the manufacturer. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
    <li> I am so &amp;#34;Happy that I found this product&amp;#34;!. It&#x27;s like an answer to my prayers. I am 52 and gone through menopause and gravity hit. Being a student in Business Administration I know a lot of competition will be out there, and it well be fresh young faces. Not having money to have the surgery I searched for a solution and found &#x27;Secret Lift Pro&#x27;! I do believe my prayer has been answered. I use &#x27;Secret Lift Pro&#x27; everyday, to give me that confidence that  I need. What is so wonderful about it is that people can&#x27;t figure out what you have done! The look is very subtle. There are also many products that enhance the effects of &#x27;Secret Lift Pro&#x27;. I recommend this product to any women that hates walking around with a permanent crease on their face.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for &#x27;Secret Lift Pro&#x27;!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m now 62 years old and thanks to some lucky genetics in facial bone structure, usually came off looking younger than my age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until recently. The past 2 years have seen jowls come to my face and neck an unmistakable marker of my true age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have lived with this, unhappily, while I consider surgery which for a variety of reasons, I really want to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, several tines a year I an in the public eye, as part of a musical group that tours nationally each year, and internationally every few years. There are photographs, interviews, meeting a lot of people I&#x27;d like to look my best for. I just couldn&#x27;t bear to accept looking so much older than I had in previous years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I tried the Face, Neck and Eye Lift, the Secret Pro Neck and Jaw Lift, and the Instant Face Neck and Eye Lift products. (hereafter referred to as the &amp;#34;Lifts&amp;#34;). I took a few weeks to experiment, and learn how to use them undetectably. The Neck lifts were pretty much undetectable unless I wore my hair up high; the face Lifts were placed very close to the ear; lower ear straight across, and upper ear/temple slanted up, both covered with the front of my haircut, which I gelled into place. I found either Face Lift product worked fine, but I liked the connivence of the Secret Lift Pro,  and tended to use them most of the time (you may prefer the other product however; everyone&#x27;s hair coverage is different. I suggest you try them all; they are reasonably priced, I think, for the results).  The Final Exam was when I wore them around the house for a day and night, and my husband thought I &amp;#34;looked great today&amp;#34; (said so), yet never detected the Lifts! Fortified, I &amp;#34;went public&amp;#34; (very public!) for last summer&#x27;s events and shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were an unmitigated success. To make a long story short, everyone (including myself), thought I looked pretty damn good. And no one ever suspected I was using the Lifts. Wow! These are great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flash forward to the present day. In anticipation of another short tour this month, I ordered my stock of Lifts. THEN I FORGOT TO PACK THEM ON MY CROSS COUNTRY TRIP, and found myself Lift-less 3 days from my first important appearance ( a private party for one of my favorite actors!),  Wothout those Lifts, I truly felt I might as well just turn around and go home, so great was my dependence on the significant appearance-booster of the Lifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, late on the night of my arrival (and finding upon unpacking that I had forgotten the Lifts), I ordered another batch of Lifts for delivery to my hotel,  and sent a rather desperate email to CosmeSearch (the company who sells all the products), begging them to somehow speed my delivery (deliveries for my past order always came promptly and within the promised &amp;#34;Standard Mail&amp;#34; timeframes, but I knew the far bounds of that time frame would not be soon enough this time). I didn&#x27;t expect success: delivery times tend to be pretty firm, as each vendor has their own standard procedures for fulfillment of orders and I don&#x27;t imagine they like to disrupt their fulfillment chain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s the miracle part: A CosmeSearch representative emailed me a reply within hours...and this was late at night on the west coast! They said the would &amp;#34;upgrade your order to expedited shipping tomorrow&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt; I offered to pay. They declined and said &amp;#34;free of charge&amp;#34;. I mean, how often do you get a great product, that level of customer responsiveness, and accommodation to your special circumstance? I know the answer. In fact I almost hesitate to write these details as I can&#x27;t believe that level of responsiveness is &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;, But you can be sure  there&#x27;s a person at the other end of your email who promptly reads and responds to our request or comment. I also think you will like the products too...as long as you experiment and test them before making your public debut!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m blown away. I will be getting my Lifts delivered to me in my hotel in time for my first important appearance .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, even greater customer service. What do you expect? 5 Stars. Wish I could give 6!</li>
