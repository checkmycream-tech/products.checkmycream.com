### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product, make my face feel refreshed and looks great!</li>
      <li>Good luck finding your happy face!  </li>
      <li>these two products together work great for problem, oily skin</li>
      <li>Worked great for me and I have medium acne</li>
      <li>Nicely done!  </li>
      <li>and it smells so good.</li>
      <li>I also have seen good results using this as a shampoo for psoriasis/egzema on the scalp.</li>
      <li>Anyway, I was really impressed by the care this product was wrapped in; full on bubble wrap envelope so even if it did explode, it wouldn&#x27;t have gotten everywhere.  </li>
      <li>When it comes to skin care, its all about finding a great product that works for YOU personally and for ME this is wonderful.</li>
      <li>I paid my own hard-earned money for this product, and did not get anything for my review.</li>
      <li>But, most of the time, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
      <li>Great product and super timely delivery.</li>
      <li>Because it is oil-free but non-drying, it is suitable for all skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t think there is a better one out there in terms of effectiveness and price.</li>
      <li>Love the refreshing feeling after rinsing it off and will probably keep using it with another product the benzoyl peroxide wash.</li>
      <li>I have used (and reviewed) many Neutrogena products, some are better than others.</li>
      <li>Some people do better with salicylic acid others with the benzoil peroxide.  </li>
      <li>Prevents most of the acne.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Most everything either irritates, breaks out, or makes me peel.  </li>
      <li>I will also add that all my friends who&#x27;ve tried it seem to like or love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s no too strong so you can use it more than once a day.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Though all Neutrogena products are a bit pricey, a beautiful and clear complexion does not come cheap</li>
      <li>I did not get this free.</li>
      <li>its doesnt do much except make your face feel nice.</li>
      <li>then if you do better with higher or lower %.  </li>
      <li>But every skin is unique.</li>
      <li>I have tried many face washes, but have really seen results with this.</li>
      <li>my skin has never felt better after using this product, it leaves your skin so soft, and clean</li>
      <li>you want even BETTER results, I would use the Oil-Free Moisture - Sensitive Skin in the morning after washing your face.</li>
      <li>I actually leave it on --kind of like a mask-- for about one minute.</li>
      <li>Ive tried most every line of skin care (from all the major department store brands to drugstore brands to order from home brands).  </li>
      <li>Ive found exactly three cleansers that I like (philosophy&#x27;s purity cleaner, Mary Kay&#x27;s timewise BAR soap---not their liquids, and this one).  </li>
      <li>Personally I find the charcoal soaps to be a LOT more efficient.</li>
      <li>The only positive thing I can say about this face wash was  that it did exfoliate my skin much better than my normal face wash-so much so that I did not need to use a scrub while using</li>
      <li>early 30s (been using this and philosophy products for years), fair-medium Caucasian skin, SENSITIVE, tan&#x27;s easily, combination oily/normal/dry skin.</li>
      <li>Another side effect was my skin became more red and a little more blotchy.</li>
      <li>and im really hoping it works</li>
      <li>Really a good product for me at least.</li>
      <li>I realize everyone has diff skin, but i highly recommend this to anyone who has oily skin to try it out and see if this works for you.&lt;br /&gt;Ps.</li>
      <li>than it would have had I kept using my normal face wash.   </li>
      <li>I love quite a few Neutrogena products</li>
      <li>Stress Control Power Cream Wash. The main acne fighting ingredient in this face wash is salicylic acid-which exfoliates to clear acne-however it cannot treat all types of acne.   </li>
      <li>So I really don&#x27;t understand why so many negative reviews.</li>
      <li>but if you have sensitive skin you will feel your face skin more dried and well</li>
      <li>and my face is completely CLEAR!</li>
      <li>Mine is sensitive.</li>
      <li>I do suggest using the Power-Cream Wash over the Scrub if you have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m reviewing the packaging on the product, rather than the product itself because it&#x27;s too early to tell if it&#x27;s working for me.  </li>
      <li>Not bad... not great... but not bad.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m allergy prone in general.</li>
      <li>My face started to clear up after 2 weeks of daily use (once a day).</li>
      <li>The only con is that sometimes, my skin is dry and extra sensitive and the &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; feeling gets to be too much.</li>
      <li>slightly pigmented, oily, 20-something, acne prone, frequent blackheads, a few lines (slightly sensitive), light skin</li>
      <li>My skin, which is oily to very oily at times became dry (especially in the chin area) and it started to flake off.</li>
      <li>None of my black heads cleared up, and I have a few more than I did before I switched to this acne wash.   </li>
      <li>If you have trouble finding cleansers try to pay attention to whether they are benzoil peroxide or salicylic acid products (most will have one or the other as active ingredient and should list a % for them on packaging).  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> its doesnt do much except make your face feel nice.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for face wash that would not make my face all blotchy but would keep acne away!! You get that all in product with this product!!</li>
    <li> Great product and super timely delivery.</li>
    <li> Really a good product for me at least. I&#x27;ve tried tons of other acne products both in America and Korea and I don&#x27;t think there is a better one out there in terms of effectiveness and price. Love the refreshing feeling after rinsing it off and will probably keep using it with another product the benzoyl peroxide wash.</li>
    <li> I have used (and reviewed) many Neutrogena products, some are better than others. After a few bad breakouts after a number of stressful situations, I decided to give the Stress Control Cream Wash a shot. I was disappointed with the results. My skin, which is oily to very oily at times became dry (especially in the chin area) and it started to flake off. My acne cleared up-but not any faster than it would have had I kept using my normal face wash.   Another side effect was my skin became more red and a little more blotchy. None of my black heads cleared up, and I have a few more than I did before I switched to this acne wash.   The only positive thing I can say about this face wash was  that it did exfoliate my skin much better than my normal face wash-so much so that I did not need to use a scrub while using Stress Control Power Cream Wash. The main acne fighting ingredient in this face wash is salicylic acid-which exfoliates to clear acne-however it cannot treat all types of acne.   Skin type: slightly pigmented, oily, 20-something, acne prone, frequent blackheads, a few lines (slightly sensitive), light skin</li>
    <li> Worked great for me and I have medium acne</li>
    <li> so i just bought this one and im really hoping it works (:&lt;br /&gt;ill write another review after tomarww (:</li>
    <li> I use this product twice a day, if you don&#x27;t have a deep acne problem i suggest you to use this cream. It&#x27;s no too strong so you can use it more than once a day.</li>
    <li> Prevents most of the acne. Couple pimples here and there but nothing BAD. Great product, make my face feel refreshed and looks great!</li>
    <li> In my mid-teenage years, I always had trouble with acne (duh!). My biggest issue was that my face was so sensitive, that most washes were too harsh and made the issue worse. I FINALLY found a product that works! - This one! My face started to clear up after 2 weeks of daily use (once a day). I have been using it for a while now and my face is completely CLEAR! I now only get the one occasional pimple every couple months. **I do suggest using the Power-Cream Wash over the Scrub if you have sensitive skin. The Scrub is too intense; at least for my skin.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want even BETTER results, I would use the Oil-Free Moisture - Sensitive Skin in the morning after washing your face. (A little goes a VERY long way)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though all Neutrogena products are a bit pricey, a beautiful and clear complexion does not come cheap</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive and works well for my skin. The only con is that sometimes, my skin is dry and extra sensitive and the &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; feeling gets to be too much. But, most of the time, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Not bad... not great... but not bad. Personally I find the charcoal soaps to be a LOT more efficient.</li>
    <li> Sadly this did not work for me, I dobt usually get pimples thats why I bought it but if you have sensitive skin you will feel your face skin more dried and well in my case get acne next yo your eyebrows, forehead, and jaw</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m reviewing the packaging on the product, rather than the product itself because it&#x27;s too early to tell if it&#x27;s working for me.  Anyway, I was really impressed by the care this product was wrapped in; full on bubble wrap envelope so even if it did explode, it wouldn&#x27;t have gotten everywhere.  Nicely done!  I did not have this happen to me, but I did wonder because of the cold weather lately.</li>
    <li> When it comes to skin care, its all about finding a great product that works for YOU personally and for ME this is wonderful. I will also add that all my friends who&#x27;ve tried it seem to like or love it. So I really don&#x27;t understand why so many negative reviews. But every skin is unique. Mine is sensitive. I&#x27;m allergy prone in general. Combination skin.  Most everything either irritates, breaks out, or makes me peel.  Ive tried most every line of skin care (from all the major department store brands to drugstore brands to order from home brands).  Ive found exactly three cleansers that I like (philosophy&#x27;s purity cleaner, Mary Kay&#x27;s timewise BAR soap---not their liquids, and this one).  Nothing else cares for the delicate harmony of my skin....  acne/oily skin cleansers make me peel after a few uses. May leave me irritated. Creamy cleansers leave me with breakouts. But THIS just WORKS. Love it. I use purity at night and this in the shower in the morning I actually leave it on --kind of like a mask-- for about one minute. To give it time to do its thing---its a salicylic acid product. Works like a charm.  If you have trouble finding cleansers try to pay attention to whether they are benzoil peroxide or salicylic acid products (most will have one or the other as active ingredient and should list a % for them on packaging).  Some people do better with salicylic acid others with the benzoil peroxide.  Try to figure out which is you...then if you do better with higher or lower %.  And of course consider how the other things you put on your face help or hurt you. Hope that helps!  Good luck finding your happy face!  MY SKIN: early 30s (been using this and philosophy products for years), fair-medium Caucasian skin, SENSITIVE, tan&#x27;s easily, combination oily/normal/dry skin. O, and other than this all my skin care products are made by philosophy---which I also recommend.</li>
    <li> I saw this in a movie of all places, and decided to try it. Now I use it every day and don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without it! Because it is oil-free but non-drying, it is suitable for all skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Controls acne without drying the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Light scent of cucumber and green tea.&lt;br /&gt;Soothes redness.&lt;br /&gt;Really does prevent acne if used daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like scent, you might not like it. However, the scent is VERY mild and comes from plants, so it is unlikely to cause an allergy. But those who prefer NO scent may wish to pass on this one.</li>
    <li> My acne has visibly started improving in only a few days after use.</li>
    <li> I have tried many face washes, but have really seen results with this. It clears your face in a couple days without overdrying your face. I also have seen good results using this as a shampoo for psoriasis/egzema on the scalp. I use this 2x a day and use garnier gel moisturizer for dry skin (pink one) these two products together work great for problem, oily skin (i have oily/large pore skin) both products are under 10 bucks too! I realize everyone has diff skin, but i highly recommend this to anyone who has oily skin to try it out and see if this works for you.&lt;br /&gt;Ps. I did not get this free. I paid my own hard-earned money for this product, and did not get anything for my review.</li>
    <li> I love quite a few Neutrogena products but this one is an exception. It feels slimy, doesn&#x27;t lather and I don&#x27;t feel like it washes entirely off my face eaving a most unpleasant greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> my skin has never felt better after using this product, it leaves your skin so soft, and clean and it smells so good. I can&#x27;t get enough of it</li>
