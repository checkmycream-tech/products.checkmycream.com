<ol>
      <li>So happy I found this product!  </li>
      <li>Great Product, Thank you</li>
      <li>Works great on hair and has a pleasant odor.</li>
      <li>I hope that the price of this product does not go up in price because of the good reviews.  </li>
      <li>Love the product!</li>
      <li>i love it my hair become good .no loss</li>
      <li>The product works in thickening my hair and making it healthy.  </li>
      <li>and I am happy that they shipped so fast.  </li>
      <li>somehow hides it better than any of the 2 million products I&#x27;ve tried!&lt;br /</li>
      <li>, I will continue to use this for awhile longer until I can tell for sure if it is working or not.</li>
      <li>My husband love this.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say foe sure if this does what it says it will ...</li>
      <li>I think I notice more hair growing too.  </li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>but it is a great styling product, for any hair ... never thick or oily, very light, but helps make your hair look fuller and happier ...</li>
      <li>To anyone debating whether or not to buy this product, I would strongly recommend giving this a try.</li>
      <li>So far so good</li>
      <li>Really, this foam is pretty darn good.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a pretty healthy guy.</li>
      <li>Its also more convenient than the serum as well as the foam goes on easy and is absorbed into the scalp much faster.</li>
      <li>I think is a better way to apply it because it is sticking to my scalp and hair very well.  </li>
      <li>so I will have to update two months from now with the full results of the product.</li>
      <li>If the product user has experienced the issue for a considerable amount of time, a more aggressive therapy may be necessary.</li>
      <li>The label says to use for a full 4 months</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used it about a month now, my hair good scalp tingles, using it</li>
      <li>I tend to use my old styling mousse rather than this one although it does work on my very fine thinning hair.</li>
      <li>Fresh clean application and smell, not greasy and light enough to apply even if you want to add some holding gel.  </li>
      <li>I apply it to the top and crown of my head twice daily.</li>
      <li>**) along my hairline where I applied the solution, but wrote it off as my barber not paying attention when he cut my hair.</li>
      <li>Over the course of the next 3 days however, more hair kept popping up at a rapid pace until I could no longer deny that this stuff works miracles.</li>
      <li>I wish it were more obvious though.  </li>
      <li>It definitely does the trick and easily replaced the hair gel I was using.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the NuHair products before and was very please with them</li>
      <li>I saw this product and was really exicited about it</li>
      <li>This product made my scalp incredibly itchy and hair fail out.</li>
      <li>Thanks again for shipping so fast.</li>
      <li>The order came really fast</li>
      <li>I can only comment on the pleasant fragrance and ease of use at this point, because the product information says you may not see results for a few months.</li>
      <li>I tried several products and none of them actually smelled ok like this</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m getting old and my hair is thinning and this helps my ebbing hairline not ebb so much.</li>
      <li>it normally</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used pretty much every solution under the sun, and this is the only one that has actually regrown my hair.    </li>
      <li>While this product improved my scalp&#x27;s appearance and my hair&#x27;s texture, I believe it should be used after early detection of hair loss.  </li>
      <li>It appears to thicken the strands near my hairline where I put it.  </li>
      <li>My hair likes it and responds to it naturally.</li>
      <li>It seems to work slowly, but surely does something.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t work for me, I have very fine thin hair</li>
      <li>It is able to thicken my hair without weighing it down or making it greasy or stiff.  </li>

    <li> Really, this foam is pretty darn good.  I have thin hair with baldy patches and this stuff somehow hides it better than any of the 2 million products I&#x27;ve tried!&lt;br /&gt;  It is able to thicken my hair without weighing it down or making it greasy or stiff.  My hair likes it and responds to it naturally.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a pretty healthy guy. So I understand that natural world takes a little longer to work than does the conventional stuff. I saw this product and was really exicited about it so I bought it and did not get the results I expect. I&#x27;ve used the NuHair products before and was very please with them so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;  This product made my scalp incredibly itchy and hair fail out. It also thinned out my hair from it&#x27;s thickness it normally has.&lt;br /&gt;  Maybe it&#x27;s not for me, maybe it&#x27;s a bad batch??? I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll be trying this product again?</li>
    <li> I can only comment on the pleasant fragrance and ease of use at this point, because the product information says you may not see results for a few months.</li>
    <li> Great Product, Thank you</li>
    <li> Did not have any impact on my hair</li>
    <li> I have been battling my thinning hair for years with Rogaine, mega doses of Biotin, and recently the laser hair comb.  I also use thickening mousse, and this Nuhair foam is sortof like the thickening mousse and Rogaine in one.  I love it.  Genius idea!</li>
    <li> While this product improved my scalp&#x27;s appearance and my hair&#x27;s texture, I believe it should be used after early detection of hair loss.  If the product user has experienced the issue for a considerable amount of time, a more aggressive therapy may be necessary.</li>
    <li> It seems to work slowly, but surely does something.I noticed an increased air growth aftef several weeks.I tried several products and none of them actually smelled ok like this</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle.  It appears to thicken the strands near my hairline where I put it.  I think I notice more hair growing too.  I wish it were more obvious though.  Not sure if I am imagining it or if it really is growing.  I just want to prevent further thinning so, I will continue to use this for awhile longer until I can tell for sure if it is working or not.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say foe sure if this does what it says it will ... the jury is still out ... but it is a great styling product, for any hair ... never thick or oily, very light, but helps make your hair look fuller and happier ...</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me, I have very fine thin hair&lt;br /&gt;This weights down my hair more, the first time I used it, my hair was dry, that left my hair feeling dirty, I had to wash it the next day, then I used it again, that time it&#x27;s left my hair very flat...I&#x27;ll keep useing what I got, cuz I did pay for it</li>
    <li> My husband love this. It does not regrow hair but seems to have stopped the hair loss. He uses it to style his hair as well.</li>
    <li> So happy I found this product!  It definitely does the trick and easily replaced the hair gel I was using.</li>
    <li> Fresh clean application and smell, not greasy and light enough to apply even if you want to add some holding gel.  I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I bought this,because I had been using minoxidil with little to no results, and it was time to give something else a chance. I bought this product, along with their DHT blocker pills. I&#x27;ve had this a total of 5 days and the results are dramatic.  I apply it to the top and crown of my head twice daily. After day two I noticed some quarter inch brown hairs (none of that blonde baby hair s***) along my hairline where I applied the solution, but wrote it off as my barber not paying attention when he cut my hair. Over the course of the next 3 days however, more hair kept popping up at a rapid pace until I could no longer deny that this stuff works miracles. In the few days that I&#x27;ve had this product, I would estimate i&#x27;ve already grown 100-200 new hair strands. I&#x27;m extremely optimistic that I will fully restore my hairline given enough time.    To anyone debating whether or not to buy this product, I would strongly recommend giving this a try. I&#x27;ve used pretty much every solution under the sun, and this is the only one that has actually regrown my hair.    In the next month or two I will update this review to report progress.</li>
    <li> So far so good I&#x27;ve only used it about a month now, my hair good scalp tingles, using it we I the foam applicator .check back in a few months.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see too much different on my hair</li>
    <li> The order came really fast and I am happy that they shipped so fast.  I will always order from this seller.  I am using it now and the directions say give it 2 to 3 months.  I am using as directed because I believe that this will help me with the problem I have with my hair.  I will let you know how it is working.  This form of the product being a foam I think is a better way to apply it because it is sticking to my scalp and hair very well.  I hope that the price of this product does not go up in price because of the good reviews.  Thanks again for shipping so fast.</li>
    <li> i love it my hair become good .no loss</li>
    <li> I started using this but I am not confirm yet what going on</li>
    <li> The product works in thickening my hair and making it healthy.  Love the product!</li>
    <li> I do like this product.  It is a nutrient plus a styling hair mousse.  I tend to use my old styling mousse rather than this one although it does work on my very fine thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Works great on hair and has a pleasant odor.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with the pills. No effect</li>
    <li> This stuff seems to work. I&#x27;m getting old and my hair is thinning and this helps my ebbing hairline not ebb so much.</li>
    <li> Does make your hair thicker from my actual use of the product. Idk if it helps in regrowing hair but I can definitely tell that if I work this into my hair at night and then wash it out in the morning my hair is noticeably thicker.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this a little over a 2 months now, and I am beginning to see definite improvements. Its also more convenient than the serum as well as the foam goes on easy and is absorbed into the scalp much faster. The label says to use for a full 4 months so I will have to update two months from now with the full results of the product.</li>
