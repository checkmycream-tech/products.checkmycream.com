<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I had gotten my hair lightened a few months ago. My hair was a medium brown, with warm undertones. While I was going for a light ashy blonde, I ended up with an orangey yellow, even after a second visit. My stylist told me that that was as light as she was going I be able to get my hair without completely frying it. She suggested I try a lightening and/or tone correcting shampoo/conditioner. I bought this, and the John Frieda Go Blonder (shampoo only for both). I alternate between the two products, usually two showers with each.  My hair did turn out much lighter, and less yellow. Unfortunately, it has also dried out quite a bit. Lucky for me, I had extremely healthy hair before, so it&#x27;s not too bad, but if your hair is dry to begin with, I would not recommend this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said above, I purchased the shampoos only. I have a great conditioner that restores a lot of moisture. I continue using that to try to offset the drying effect the shampoo has.</li>
    <li> it does the same thing but actually moisturizes your hair. my first hair product that under-advertised its product. i cant rate it a perfect 5 because i don&#x27;t know if it tone corrects brassy hair. i know its good for keeping an ashy medium/light brown hair ashy. i&#x27;ve never trusted shampoos or hair care to fix my color, i just rather have the color that i want and work with it from their, so maintenance was key for me. and this does a good job maintaining my color.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this product would help...correct some of the damage done (with keywords like &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;) during the bleaching process with my stylist and help speed along the results (we were going from a medium brown and doing the highlighting method to a gold blonde every month to prevent the usual damage/total burn out, then planning on getting that to a whitish blonde). This product was worse for my hair than anything I did at the salon. Or outside of it, come to think about it (including bleaching it myself and box color).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, seriously. The chemical smell, eye burning, loss of hair...it was like going through a harsher bleaching process and totally not worth it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t color my hair for two years.&lt;br /&gt;While I was trying not to color colored part of them became very yellow because of sun.&lt;br /&gt;Sheer Blond is really good to hide that effect.&lt;br /&gt;It is also perfect on my natural color hair.</li>
    <li> We have well water that immediately  turns my dyed blond hair orangey and brassy. I use this shampoo every day and there is no sign of orange.</li>
    <li> Very good quality. Very prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> Does the job!!But remeber it will dries out your hair badly. So You must use good mask to back up the dryness.</li>
    <li> About 5 wks. ago I tried a new hairdresser out and was I ever sorry I did.  I am a golden light blonde and I came away from there with GREY hair!!!!!!!!!!!!  I went to the store and found the tone correcting shampoo by John Frieda and it corrected my color back to normal after the 3rd shampoo!  this stuff really does what it says it will do!!!!!!!it corrected the tone of my color back to my normal golden blonde.  You will love this product for any brassiness you get between color treatments.  It works like magic!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Works as well as Clairol Shimmering lights.  Tones down brassiness pretty well or at least better than not using it. It lathers really well too.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to remove the brassiness from my caramel highlights in my balayage (caramel on dark brown hair). Although it doesn&#x27;t restore to the original color it does remove some of the brassiness after 3 to 4 washes. I left it in for 5 to 10 minutes, then rinsed. This does dry your hair so apply generous conditioner and leave it in for a bit. I have used it two times a week. The smell is nice: light and floral. You can alternate with your regular shampoo between washes. Also this is not a sulfate-free shampoo.     Update:  I now mix this into a bit of my regular shampoo and then leave it in my hair for 5-10 minutes. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry when I do this now.</li>
    <li> Thrilled with the reduction of the brassy tones and leaves my hair shinny</li>
    <li> For years I have been dying my light brown hair a darker brown (semi permanent) but was ready to go lighter again. So I ended up getting A LOT of highlights on my head. They looked okay, but very stripey looking on the top of my head and I&#x27;m not a fan of that. I like my highlights to blend in, but since my hair was still fading from the dark brown  the contrast was just too much. My stylist decided to go with a warmer tone and wanted to gradually get me lighter but I couldn&#x27;t handle the yellowish and brassy tones of the highlights. I look better with ashy tones. So I googled for hours and came across purple shampoo which I never heard of before. So I Purchased JF tone correcting shampoo and let me just tell you that after 3 washes my hair looks awesome! It totally blended my hair and made the highlights are a cooler tone. I did leave the shampoo lathered on my head for about 10 minutes each time though. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about it is that it dries your hair out a lot. Nothing a good hair mask can&#x27;t fix though! I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love all the John Frieda Sheer Blonde products!! They work so well on my color treated blonde thin fine hair. I use the shampoo, conditioner, and hairspray!! So glad I found out about these great products!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I did ombré to my hair which kind of caused a little brassiness onto the ends of my hair, but I use this everyday on the ends of my hair and it&#x27;s been doing the job, fading out the orange, metallic, yellow tone of my hair! Lovin it!</li>
    <li> I went to a salon and they sent me home with horrific orange highlights. I was so appalled I did not want to go back there for them to ruin my hair more. I bought this and after about 3 washes the orange was completely gone!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay not the best I&#x27;ve used bit for the price it&#x27;s worth it ☺️</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my white/gray hair look.</li>
    <li> This product really dries out hair &amp; the scalp, so make sure that you use a good, deep conditioner with it.  It works, but at a cost (the dry hair).</li>
    <li> hair gets dry when using this shampoo. Does not improve brassiness in hair. Would not recommend buying unless u want to dry out your hair.</li>
    <li> I love it helps keep my blonde color nice and fresh.</li>
    <li> It made my scalp really dry... Tried it three separate occasions, to see if it was the shampoo or something else. Every time my scalp got itchy and dry.</li>
    <li> In only one shampoo, it corrected my very golden, blonde hair, and made it more suited to my age.  So far, once a week does the trick.</li>
    <li> The purple shampoo really does help to take out the brassiness out of my hair.  keeps just the hint of strawberry color without it going to gold .</li>
    <li> I had significant amount of residue henna in my long naturally-blonde hair. This shampoo does the trick. Does not take the red out completely (duh) - but turns brassy into cooler strawberry-blonde shade.&lt;br /&gt;You have to keep using it continuously though, as there is no permanent effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hint: Brazilian keratin treatment took the rest of the red out of my hair completely at last. I did not expect that effect, but pretty cool.</li>
    <li> Really helps remove the brassiness due to hard water</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my color at home with ION hair color and the 9N picks up more red than I would like. This product helps tone it down and doesn&#x27;t strip my hair of moisture like other products.</li>
    <li> Just for the record, I bought this at Walmart, not on Amazon. But, since I go straight to Amazon to read reviews, I decided to post my review here. First - this product worked for me. I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but saw a slight difference after the first use, and even more after the second. So it&#x27;s safe to assume that I will after the third use. I haven&#x27;t tried the conditioner, but may in the future. About my hair - thinner, darkest blonde possible (Level 6.) so, I got sick of home-highlighting, and decided to try a Level 8 to lighten it. First time was fine, 2nd time, not so much. Red/orange tones. So I highlighted again, thinking if this color spares me from highlighting at home every other time, that&#x27;s an improvement. Highlights were fine, but the base color was still too orange at the now 2-inch roots. Tried another product (didn&#x27;t do squat) so moved to the JF Blonde Colour Renew Tone-Correcting. Pro - it did make a noticeable difference. Immediately, and more so with the 2nd use. Con - it dried out my hair like crazy.  But I will keep using it, because I have excellent conditioners. Worth the temporary, extra care each month. It&#x27;s worth a try, but be prepared to extra-condition your hair after each use, if your hair reacts that way. If it doesn&#x27;t help you, you either have resistant hair or you need to go a shade darker next time (something I still might try myself). Neutralized my orange enough to not be so noticeable - the only comment I got was &amp;#34;your hair looks blonder.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Really removed the brassiness of my bleached blonde hair.</li>
    <li> John Frieda Sheer Blonde Colour Renew Tone-Correcting Shampoos works.&lt;br /&gt;Two different blondes tried it. This shampoo revived the blonde shades of a natural blonde, with blonde highlights.&lt;br /&gt;It also was tested by a blonde that uses a blonde vanilla hair rinse that invariably adds a pretty red shade to  her hair, but the red color was changing in a way that  wasn&#x27;t flattering. When she used this shampoo it took some brassiness out of her hair color, but  left her hair feeling nasty, needing conditioner. She doesn&#x27;t normally have to use conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, [[ASIN:B005MIFIWK John Frieda Sheer Blonde Colour Renew Tone-Correcting Shampoo]] works as advertised, but be aware, you might need to use conditioner too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo contains an optical brightener, is purple &amp; has a nice scent. Use up to 3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;Ammonia &amp; peroxide free.</li>
    <li> I like this - I was so happy when I first opened this and saw that the shampoo was PURPLE.  I used to buy this shampoo called Grey Foxes and it was purple.  Although my hair is light blonde streaked with white, and not grey, the purple tones down the warmth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The John Frieda shampooed in like a dream, with nice luxurious bubbles and clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it with no conditioner, just some argan oil on my hair after it&#x27;s washed.  In my hair, it takes it to several shades cooler.  My hair is the same color, but instead of looking yellow, it looks like a neutral pale straw and the white strands shine like platinum.  It definitely tones down brassiness.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, and it leaves it soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m tickled they are making this.  I think blondes looking to cool their shades a bit, and people with aged whiter hair will like it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed this leaves my hair smelling good for 3 days!  I&#x27;ve got long hair so I don&#x27;t always wash it every day - it&#x27;s another reason I&#x27;m loving this shampoo!</li>
    <li> The short version review is that this shampoo actually works to tone down the brassiness and sharpen the blonde. It won&#x27;t work in just one use, but after a few days, it definitely works. My advice would be use it 3 days in a row and then skip to every other day, and then finally just 3 days a week. The shampoo has a nice frothy lather and rinses easily. It actually feels like you&#x27;ve had a salon shampoo, after its rinsed. You don&#x27;t have to use it every day, but it does have to be used a few times before you see any real results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The long version of the review is that my hair is naturally a dirty blonde/light brown. I think it&#x27;s called drab or blah or boring, I forget which :p&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually dye it a nice chestnut or mahogany brown. Once summer came, I got bored and decided to do some platinum highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks later, I decided to do strawberry blonde and see how that looked with the highlights. I found out that the strawberry blonde shade I had used for years (prior to using brown) was discontinued and I didn&#x27;t wanna try a different brand and shade. None really looked like similar to what I used before anyway. So, I got the bright idea to just buy a platinum blonde and use that and see what happened. I came on Amazon and bought 6 packages of blonde dye. I have to use 3 at a time since my hair is so long and I figured one time wouldn&#x27;t give me the results I wanted. So, I used the first 3 packages and as expected it barely did anything except lighten the roots a little and enhanced the highlights. Next day I used the other 3 packages and got a lighter shade of brown/ borderline strawberry blonde and my highlights were very sharp. I was glad it didn&#x27;t turn out blonde because I actually hate blonde hair....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, end of summer now and after way too many processes on my hair, it had started to show signs of blah and drab with a bit of brassiness/bad dye job look. That&#x27;s when I decided to give this shampoo a try. I passed on it a few times, but then figured I might as well try. I am glad I did because my hair looks refreshed. It has a bit of added shine and the toning makes my hair look healthier overall. The dullness was eliminated and so the highlights look a little brighter.few times, but then figured I might as well try. I am glad I did because my hair looks refreshed.

    <li> I have brown hair that tends to have chunks of blonde, gray, and brassy orange running through it. Years ago I learned that tone correcting shampoo for blondes, used once a week or so, would tone down everything, not just the blonde. The John Frieda works great, turning my brassy streaks into softer lighter blondes and less orange. The color of the shampoo can be scary, but it works and doesn&#x27;t leave a mess in the shower. While the main thrust is color correcting, it also is a great shampoo, leaving my hair clean and soft.</li>
    <li> I use to use a lot of John Frieda&#x27;s products but they seem to have changed formula. I have thick hair and this shampoo leaves it rough and very hard to comb through after even with conditioning. Everyones hair is different.</li>
    <li> My hair is thick, fine, and naturally blonde. Even though the product is designed for color treated blonde hair, I like what this shampoo does to the color and texture of my hair. The shampoo is purple! Be ready for it. It has a nice level of conditioner in the shampoo that moisturizes. I don&#x27;t need to use conditioner with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Okay, it&#x27;s not like the super blonde, in fact it&#x27;s probably opposite. It takes all of the unnatural looking blonde tones out. My hair naturally in the winter looks dirty blonde the shampoo took all brassy highlights out and kind of made my blonde look darker instead of lighter.</li>
    <li> i am a strawberry blonde and this tames my copper colour fr over riding my hair</li>
    <li> I have tried several John Frieda products over the years and have always been impressed with them all. I&#x27;ve never had a bad experience with any of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is a natural medium blonde that glistens blonde in the summer sun.  I only highlight it sporadically, and this shampoo does a nice job locking in that natural sheen.  The shampoo smells nice and makes my hair feel softer as well.  You don&#x27;t need much to get a nice lather going.  I let it sit for a bit as I shower up, then rinse after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a shampoo I&#x27;ll be using once a week to keep that sheen going</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Purple!  Oh happy dance.  This John Frieda Blonde Shampoo has a wonderfully light fragrance and it suds up with just using a bit.  My daughter says it didn&#x27;t dry out her hair like some others do and it made her hair brighter after just a couple of uses.  She has two different colors of blonde in her hair and neither were brassy looking.  Tina says it works just as well as the colour renewing shampoo she bought a few weeks ago for more $$.  Now she needs to get the conditioner to go with it in order to see the full effects but so far she is pleased and that&#x27;s what counts.</li>
    <li> I have blonde hair that lightens over the summer with exposure to the sun, but it also retains colors from the pool. I tried the John Frieda Sheer Blonde Colour Renew shampoo via the Amazon Vine program to see if it would make a difference, and to my eyes, it did. It took some of the brassy highlights out, and gave me a slightly softer shade. My 3 year old son compared my hair to the &amp;#34;corn hairs&amp;#34; (silks on the corn), so it definitely made it softer in about a week (I shampoo almost every day). I have hair almost to the small of my back, and it tangles a lot. It was much easier to comb out after using the shampoo, and my regular conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a week. My hair is soft and maybe the highlights are slightly brighter but if so it is a very subtle difference. At double the price of my current shampoo I don&#x27;t think it packs enough bang for it&#x27;s buck but on sale I wouldn&#x27;t be averse to getting it again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is an odd purple color but it has a pleasant lavender scent and cleans well without leaving hair feeling stripped.  Surprisingly, it does noticeably make blonde tones look more natural.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical of shampoos and conditioners and other products that make claims about color, curl, making hair thicker, softer etc.  I have a cupboard full of shampoos, hair conditioners, oils and more for hair and most of them don&#x27;t do much more than wash and soften.  So I was pleasantly surprised to find that this item did do more than just clean my hair. For the last few months I&#x27;ve been struggling with my hair color--varying shades of blonde and this last one was a bit brassy and dark. After using this for three days my hair is less brassy and a bit lighter...almost looks like highlights.  Of course I don&#x27;t know if after three washings my hair would have been less brassy and lighter without this product, but the slight highlights I am definitely attributing to this shampoo.  Worked well as just a plain shampoo too!~</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed using this shampoo! It cleaned my hair well, without leaving my head dry or greasy. The  smell is also wonderful!</li>
    <li> Theoretically, color correcting is pretty simple - you could get the same job done with a bit of purple hair dye and your own bottle of shampoo, since this works by counteracting the orange in your color (think of the color wheel - orange and purple are opposite of each other so when mixed, they create a neutral shade). But somehow, it seems to be really hard to find a toning shampoo that doesn&#x27;t fry my color treated hair but that also has enough tone in it to soften my color without turning my hair an odd shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The John Frieda shampoo is the perfect shampoo. Not only does it keep my hair shiny and soft, but it adds just the right tone to balance out my blonde highlights (for the record, I am naturally dark blonde). Not only that, but at the tips of my hair where it has gone lighter blonde, it doesn&#x27;t turn my hair purple, which some toners can do. Perfect color and healthy hair? Amazing. Not only does it extend my highlights, but it gives my color that extra oomph to make it look picture perfect.</li>
    <li> John Frieda Sheer Blonde Colour Renew does an excellent job of exactly what it says, renewing your blonde coloring. The water in our area is extremely hard and blonde hair color quickly takes on a brassy orange tone. Just one shampoo with this product and the beautiful blonde glowed again. It also moisturized my hair, something I was not expecting! Shiny, healthy looking hair and fresh looking blonde color? Oh, Yeah! This product is a winner!</li>
    <li> Takes out the brassy but really dries out my hair. I couldn&#x27;t figure out why my hair was getting so dry and puffy until I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo better than the conditioner. Although, both smell different than I remember -- not necessarily a good thing. Smell is not refreshing and almost seems too strong. Shampoo makes my hair dry so I would recommend a good conditioner that moisturizes afterwards (AND NOT MATCHING CONDITIONER - makes hair greasy and is not worth price)</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it everyday.  It is gentle, smells great and removes brassiness from my colored blonde highlights.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was a little shocked when I saw the color of this shampoo -- it&#x27;s purple.  But there is no need to worry, the shampoo&#x27;s color does not stay in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium brown hair with dark blonde (caramel color) highlights.  It had been approximately six weeks since I had my highlights done when I first used this shampoo so they needed some renewal.  I thought my highlights looked brighter after shampooing with this but someone with lighter blonde color treated hair might notice even more effect.  I has a nice smell and my hair felt good.</li>
    <li> Totally dries out hair and doesn&#x27;t have enough pigment to tone out brassiness. Sorry, I wanted to like it, but it did nothing for me other than strip out all moisture and made my hair feel like straw.</li>
    <li> I have dark blonde to light brown hair that I get blonde highlights in about once every 6-8 weeks. I do have well water, but it&#x27;s softened and not very \\&quot;hard\\&quot; at all.  Every so often, I notice that my blonde starts to look a little brassy (\\&quot;orangey\\&quot;), and it really takes away from the beautiful job my colorist does. She had recommended Paul Mitchel violet shampoo, but was always out of stock.  I happened to be at the drug store and saw this on sale, so I picked up both the shampoo &amp; conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got my hair colored about 4 weeks ago, so it&#x27;s only very mildly brassy (only I would notice).  Now, everyone is different, but I would have to say that after one use, that brassiness had definitely subsided, and after my 2nd use today, it&#x27;s completely gone and my blonde looks a radiant blonde again. Also, my hair seems to still have great body yet is soft.  I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other hair products I use:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B005HIHEMC L&#x27;Oreal Everstyle Volume Root Lift Spray, 8.5 Fluid Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004I27M48 Living Proof Full Thickening Mousse 5 oz]]</li>
    <li> Good for getting the brassiness out of blonde. I used to use the much more expensive aveda purple shampoo (called blue malva). This works just as good for way less. You only want to use it once or twice a week. I use the other John Freida blonde shampoos for daily use. The whole line is very good especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Really helps the blonde come out in my highlights and seems to really make my hair shine. Love the way it feels.</li>
    <li> This large tube of shampoo has a very purple color to help with the brassiness of blond hair. I&#x27;ve used this color of shampoo before with other brands and they all help to neutralize the color. I found the John Frieda brand to have a nice consistency. It made my hair clean and shiny, but didn&#x27;t really make the blond pop out more. The fragrance is a little too strong for me. Overall, it works fine, but there are other brands that smell better, which makes me like them better then this brand.</li>
    <li> I have some red and blonde streaks in my hair, so I tested this shampoo by washing half my head with this product a few times, so I could see for myself if it made any difference.&lt;br /&gt;It was slight, but indeed noticeable. The blonde had been turning a bit orange-y, partially due to the fact that I have well water with a very high rust content.&lt;br /&gt;John Frieda Color Renew has taken the orange down a notch, helping to stretch out the time between touch-ups or re-color.</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally light brown with some blonde highlights.  It is fine/med and about 2 inches below my shoulders.  We have well water and though a softener is in place, once in a while we get some hard water come through.  I normally use a Malibu treatment once a week or every two weeks.  That seems to take care of the nasty orange on my hair but the treatment can dry my hair a bit too much.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a purple shampoo and it worked ok.  I saw the orange go away after 3 washes - it turned my hair really dry and coarse so I definitely recommend a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the shampoo 5 times now and aside from taking the orange off of my blonde highlights, I haven&#x27;t seen any extra shine or softness on my hair.  In the other hand, my hair seems drier than usual even with my deep conditioner.  I think this shampoo is more for a special treatment rather than a regular use.  So far it&#x27;s ok, use with conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo for removing brassiness and yellow tones from color-treated blond hair.  I color my hair regularly and like to use a shampoo like this right after coloring as well as after a few weeks to renew my color.  This shampoo works well to make my blonde color look great.  It has a pleasant fragrance and leaves my hair clean and soft.  With recommended use of at least three times a week, it removes brassiness and refreshes my color.  I definitely recommend this shampoo (and the accompanying conditioner) for any color-treated blondes.</li>
    <li> This works very well on my blonde color-treated hair and the price is great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a salon blonde and when my stylist recommended a toning shampoo and conditioner, I felt like I was going on a wild goose chase. Apparently it was supposed to be easy to find in my local mega store or supermarket, but it wasn&#x27;t. But it was easy to find on Amazon! And at a much better price than the online beauty specialty stores. It keeps the brassiness away and doesn&#x27;t keep me in debt.</li>
    <li> This product truly helped the color of my hair. I attempted to dye my hair at home and the results were less then desirable. The bottom of my hair turned a brassy orange color and the top of my hair turned bright yellow. Supper sexy, I know. I have washed my hair approximately five times with this product and the yellow is turning a white blonde color and the brassy orange bottom of my hair is turning a darker, more natural blonde. True my hair is still two different colors, but the shampoo cannot be held responsible for that.</li>
    <li> This product was great...a must have for not-so-natural blondes. Price and shipping were unbeatable. Shampoo completely got rid of the brassy orange/yellow tones.</li>
    <li> Smells great, but I don&#x27;t like the way it leaves my hair feeling and my hair is dirty the next day when I can typically go 2+ days without washing/conditioning. It has kept the brassy tones down which is tough to do with the super hard water I have.</li>
    <li> Truly works!!!! Couldn&#x27;t find in stores...</li>
    <li> This shampoo did a decent job of getting rid of the brassiness in my blonde hair, however after the 3rd or 4th use, I noticed my hair was extremely dry!!! I use a deep conditioner, but it did not help. I had to stop using this shampoo, and I&#x27;m still trying to get my hair back to looking as healthy as it was before I began using it. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I decided to dye my hair on my own to save some money. It can&#x27;t be that hard right? HAHA. Boy was I wrong. I developed \\&quot;hot roots.\\&quot; Boy did my fiance find me attractive ;) BUT this product saved me!!! After just one wash it took a lot of the orange out. The first time I used it I let it soak for about 5 minutes. After 3 washes I didn&#x27;t have any orange. I am beyond happy with this product!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is saving my hair!!  I am naturally medium-dark brown and my hair gets dyed blond for work (every month).  It looks great when I come out of the salon.. but after a week reddish tones come out and I look quite gingery by the end of the month.  I started using this shampoo &amp; conditioner.. and WOW.  What a difference it makes.  I wash my hair twice a week with it.  It lathers really well, and the conditioner is thick and creamy.  Everyone I work with has commented on how great my hair color is now... and have I been getting them to do something different at my monthly appointments!  Nope.. only started using this shampoo &amp; conditioner.  Really well priced too!</li>
    <li> I overestimated how much 8.45 ounces would be. I thought one tube wouldn&#x27;t be enough to last me a month and it has. However purchasing two tubes at once does save you some money.</li>
    <li> I use both the shampoo and conditioner for this product. It&#x27;s great to use as a quick tough up as I do notice less brassy blonde after use. My complaint is that it leaves my hair super dry and frizzy, even with the recommended conditioner. I use this once a week or less as a maintenance product in between salon visits.</li>
    <li> I have used this product here and there over the years. It really does brighten your highlights. I generally love John Frieda products.</li>
    <li> very good this work so good but  you need used in one or two moths you see the result</li>
    <li> I have blonde highlights and lowlights all throughout my brown hair. I stopped buying color toning/correcting shampoos, simply because I never saw results with other expensive salon-brands.&lt;br /&gt;My stylist does a fantastic job of toning and coloring my blonde. However, my hair turns slightly brassy and dull during the weeks awaiting my next appointment. In one wash after using this, I not only noticed the red tones fade out, but my hair felt and smelt GREAT. Honestly, I won&#x27;t be looking back at this point. I highly highly recommend to anyone who needs to revive their gold locks, while having soft and amazing hair.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo for three reasons...it thoroughly cleanses hair, it smells good😜, and it helped correct the brassiness that comes from over-bleaching.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo and like it because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* This violet-colored shampoo absorbs UV light and emits white-blue light, making blonde hair appear brighter.&lt;br /&gt;* Results are achieved in no more than 3 uses.&lt;br /&gt;* The size is ok - 8.45 oz.&lt;br /&gt;* Smells nice. The 5th ingredient is flower extract.&lt;br /&gt;* As noted above, the shampoo is violet, it contains violet 2 dye.&lt;br /&gt;* It actually made my hair appear brighter.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe the difference this product has made to my blonde hair over the few weeks I have been using it!  My color looks amazing with much less red, brassy tones!  I thought there was an issue with the color being used on my hair but clearly this shampoo and conditioner is all I needed.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I thought this was just an ok product with a violent purple color that did a great job cleaning my hair. That is until I went to work and had 3 people ask me what I had \\&quot;done\\&quot;. I have waist length undyed hair that used to be auburn but is now 75% white. The contrast leaves me with what sometimes seems like blonde highlights in my hair. Don&#x27;t ask me how.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I have spent the day fending off questions about what salon I use and what kind of dye job did I have done (none and none). This shampoo imparts no dye but does seem to help boost gloss and shine. It lathers well and as I said, has a wild purple color. My hair looks and feels great and I don&#x27;t mind people thinking I had something done. For the compliments, 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This is a good in-between product when you want something other than just regular shampoo that does nothing for your blone hair, but also don&#x27;t want something as harsh as Purple Shampoo (blondes Google it if you&#x27;ve never tried it. It turns brassy hair more natural). I naturally have very deep dark brown hair, and have it bleached blonde each month at a salon. Because my natural color is so dark, I get brassiness tones in it. My stylist uses a toner, but that only works so long. So usually I use Purple Shampoo which I just discovered last year is the miracle cure for brassy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Purple Shampoo is terribly drying to hair. This Sheer Blonde is a great in-between option. It works just a little like the Purple Shampoo to help tone down brassiness, but leaves your hair more like you would get with a regular shampoo, not as dry. It also smells so much better than traditional toner shampoos. It leaves my hair much more like I prefer it, and not smelling of chemicals. This is a great product for those of us who get our dark hair dyed blonde, and need something to help give it a more natural tone.</li>
    <li> While this shampoo has a nice lather and rinses clean, it does seem awfully drying. Even when followed by an appropriately matched conditioner, the effect is a little frizzy and a little drying. As is my overall experience with John Frieda, the shampoos and conditioners for dark hair are luxurious (just the shampoos and conditioners ... don&#x27;t travel outside of those boundaries), but the products for light hair seem somewhat drying and damaging. This is especially true in light of [[ASIN:B004DK7DVC John Frieda Sheer Blonde Go Blonder Controlled Lightening Spray, 3.5 Ounce]] ... which has caused irreparable damage and breakage.    Ultimately, I tossed this one in the garbage ... I don&#x27;t want this to be another John Frieda Sheer Blonde Go Blonder Controlled Lightening Spray incident.</li>
    <li> John Frieda Sheer Blonde Colour Renew -&lt;br /&gt;I am a natural strawberry blonde who has never colored her hair before until recently since it seems for some strange reason as my children has started to enter their teen years it is doing strange things to my hair and I find myself wanting to get the color back to the preteen years.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I went to have it colored right before getting this shampoo and I am sooooo glad I had it to help to fix whatever happened since my hair came out far to brassy and almost orange! EEKS - so using this really helped to get it back to a more me like color again.&lt;br /&gt;I really love how soft and manageable it has made my hair without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> I have used lots of purple shampoos. Right now I am mostly grey with blonde from when I used to dye it. I am growing it out to all grey so I don&#x27;t want the blond to be bright or brassy. It makes too much of a contrast. This shampoo is fabulous for the blonde. It cools it down to a nice more flattering blonde while transitioning more subtly to the grey. This brightens up the grey nicely too. This shampoo is not too drying which is important if you are dying hair. It cleans well and smells fine (but barely there).</li>
    <li> I lightened my brown hair  with a loreal hair color for platinum blonde. After using the John Freida color renew tone restoring shampoo and conditioner, my yellow is gone. Now I have the blonde hair I was meant to have. Excellent product, I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> At 66 years old, I have tried a great number of shampoos over the years. Some expensive and great, some not so expensive but still great. Also, in the other direction some very expensive and horrible as well as some very cheap and worthless. John Frieda is one of the greatest shampoos I&#x27;ve ever tried. I don&#x27;t have to use unhealthy hair colors to obtain the look I want. With the Sheer Blonde shampoo and conditioner, my hair helps me retain my blonde color, and most people think I&#x27;m ten years younger than I really am. Only my close friends and family know for sure. Thank you John Frieda. Oh, he has lots of other formulas too.</li>
    <li> Keeps brassiness from coming back when in between toner and dye jobs</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo + conditioner. I have a blonde top with a dark red on my bottom half, and the combo does a great job at restoring my blonde even when some of my red bleeds into my blonde and it never damages my red (or not that i&#x27;ve noticed to date). :)</li>
    <li> Great Product, great price. Love that it&#x27;s in subscribe and save!!!  It&#x27;s nice to not have to run to the store for it.</li>
    <li> I highlight my hair at home (don&#x27;t judge me) and I use this to keep the brassy look out of my hair. It was initially an experiment but I like it so much. and can&#x27;t reliably get it locally that I now get replacements from Amazon. Not a major story, but I like it.</li>
    <li> I have very dark brown hair.  It is difficult to get me bleached to very blonde.  There is always a residual yellow cast that I have to deal with.  This shampoo makes a real difference.  Even though the directions don&#x27;t recommend daily use I do use it daily and have never gotten a purple color on my hair.  It is a gentle shampoo and seems to even improve my hair&#x27;s condition.  I like the conditioner as well.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a blond -- natural or otherwise --, you&#x27;ll be very happy with John Frieda&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner, Blonde Color Renew. These 2 products keep my color true and bright up until my next coloring appointment. Alas, they&#x27;re hard to find in most stores, so I always get them from amazon at a great price. I recommend all Frieda&#x27;s products made especially for blondes.</li>
    <li> This is a good shampoo with a light pleasing aroma that works about as well as most any shampoo.  The WOW Factor with John Frieda&#x27;s colour renew tone-correcting product is that it lives up to it&#x27;s claim to neutralize brassiness and restore the blond tones you paid so much for at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally use the blond restoring shampoos to get the ugly yellow tones out of my gray hair.  I&#x27;ve used other products but the John Frieda formulae is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried so far.  The label says it may take three applications per week to see the greatest results.  There is no ammonia or peroxide in this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have not used tone correcting products for blond hair before you may be surprised when you squeeze a dab from the tube to see that it&#x27;s purple.  Don&#x27;t be alarmed.  You won&#x27;t turn into a blue hair.  There is no residual color left after you shampoo and rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product to help you hold on to the color you want.</li>
    <li> I am a blonde, or I used to be. Now, I&#x27;m going mostly white instead of gray or silver. This shampoo has a nice fragrance, and really brings out the shine in my white hair. My hair looks cleaner and shinier than it did before I used it. It lathers up nicely and a little goes a long way. It leaves my hair feeling nice and soft. It&#x27;s a nice shampoo and I may switch from the other tone correcting shampoo that I have been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to swithc up my shampoo anyway, so as not to get buildup from using the same shampoo for long periods of time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried John Frieda products, their Frizz Ease line for years, and was very satisfied with those products.  I had never tried this product tho, Sheer Blonde Colour Renew.  I&#x27;ve never had blonde hair in my life.  Before I stopped coloring my hair in my 40&#x27;s, because it was always an ordeal, it took so much time to do it, not to mention the expense and mess, my hair was a dark brown color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve stopped coloring my hair it is more of a salt and pepper, with more of the salt, gray closer to my face, which a small part of that had a yellowish tone to it, which I did not like.  So after asking a question on Amazon as to would this product be suitable in my situation, I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iam not trying to have blonde hair, Iam not even sure this product could do that, I just wanted to get rid of the yellowish, brassy tone that a small part of my gray hair had.  Well, this shampoo did the trick!  Now the gray part is a solid gray, with no yellowish tone to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the tube of this shampoo, easier to squeeze than a bottle, and takes up less room in my shower.  I actually washed my hair, then repeated it.  The scent is pleasant, I think due to the fact that it contains lavender, my favorite fragrance period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have said that this shampoo is drying, but I didn&#x27;t find that, but then I always have to use conditioner, if I want to get a brush through my thick, long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is soft and shiny, which is what I want from a shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say Iam very impressed with how fast I could see results.  I can&#x27;t say how this product would work if you indeed do have blonde hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions, they don&#x27;t say you have to wash then repeat, or that you have to leave the shampoo on your hair.  They do recommend for best results that you do use it 3 times per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great John Frieda product!</li>
    <li> I am simple. I color my own hair.  It never looks bad but it never looks great. This is the first time I have used a product that corrects tone and neutralizes brassiness. I waited until I was ready to color my hair again so I could test this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I should mention as a Vine participant, I only received one tube and not two.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of you are expert at hair color (You sound like scientists or chemists. I read your reviews) and you know the color of color correcting shampoos is supposed to be blue. I didn&#x27;t, and when I squeezed this brilliant blue shampoo out of the (8.45 fl.oz.) tube, I freaked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I flashed on myself looking like the multi-colored green-blue-pink-purple haired teen girls who hang around smoking on the corner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It all ended well. The blue turned white and lathered up beautifully. The scent was light and hardly noticeable.  It didn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Sheer Blond Colour Renew Tone Correcting Shampoo perked up my color and made my brassy, straw colored, wire-like hair that was faded and tired and ready to be colored look shinny and alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a simple person who doesn&#x27;t fuss much with my hair I want to report that I simply adore this product.</li>
    <li> I recommend leaving this on your hair for up to an hour, then rinsing out, for a really spectacular result. It truly works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use it for more reasonable lengths of time, but I prefer to get that impact. Brassy tones will vanish!</li>
    <li> Makes hair silky!!&lt;br /&gt;Smells great.&lt;br /&gt;Lots of lather so it lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> I am a blonde with some assistance from my hairdresser and some shampoos can make it brassy by the end of the bottle. I need to be careful when making a purchase and this shampoo keeps my hair vibrant blonde without any dullness or color change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I alternate this shampoo with another one ([[ASIN:B004GVBZ6C Tigi Bed Head Dumb Blonde Shampoo, 25.36 Ounce]]) for the best results since using just this shampoo can dry my hair out.  If you are a natural blonde, this might not be a factor.  I wash my hair every day and also throw a shine enhancer shampoo into the rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nickel sized amount of shampoo does the job. It provides plenty of suds and does a good job of cleaning my hair of styling products without over stripping (although it can dry out if used by itself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo keeps my blondness fresh between salon visits and providing this at the price listed is a bargain!</li>
    <li> It smelt good but it was pretty s***y, I had blonde hair but after like 1 month I notice it started turning orange / red and I bought this to try and help but it didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
    <li> I used this product when I bleached my hair.  I used it together with the John Frieda Conditioner, and had no problems keeping my hair vibrant white, and it never really turned that terrible brassy color at all.</li>
    <li> I recently colored my hair, a shade lighter than normal. I went from a dark blonde to medium blonde and was left extremely brassy. I bought this at my local Walgreens store after reading the reviews. I love the fragrance and it lathers really well. I also did not have any problems with it drying my hair out like several of the other reviews mentioned. However, I have not noticed any change in the brassiness either. I am still hoping that after a few more uses that it could still help. I will post an update later.&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;I continued to use this shampoo with no change to the color of my hair at all. However, it did begin to dry my hair out after about the 4th use. I would not recommend this product.</li>
