### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The best face conditioning cream produced ever !</li>
      <li>Perfect in combination with a bb cushion</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this conditioning balm is excellent for the people who look for a &amp;#34;non-make up&amp;#34; kinda looking face.</li>
      <li>Turns your face into a perfect palette, making your makeup/skin look even better.&lt;br /&gt;3.)</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful product I&#x27;m thrilled to have found it.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!!</li>
      <li>As much as I love perfect skin</li>
      <li>I love it, it&#x27;s perfect for Asianic skin.</li>
      <li>Good product...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a combination skin type and this fit me perfectly.</li>
      <li>: I have a Caucasian friend who tried this, and it also looks good on her.</li>
      <li>I love the product!</li>
      <li>Love this product, good moisture and sunscreen.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;, but she didn&#x27;t care, she still loved it. :)</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin kind of sticky and cakey</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice, smells like sunblock sort of.</li>
      <li>Gives my skin a nice texture.</li>
      <li>I purchased this along with the Etude house Bright and Fit BB Cream.</li>
      <li>so it blends in nicely :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a face conditioning cream , but there are others like the one in Wishtrend that worked better than this one .</li>
      <li>I love this face conditioner.</li>
      <li>great smell, but it does not work very well for me.</li>
      <li>This product is great at smoothing your skin , however there isn&#x27;t much of a whitening effect as I have hoped .</li>
      <li>I stopped using it for about 2 weeks and my skin got better.</li>
      <li>If you have problem skin then use another primer on top of the conditioning cream for better coverage.</li>
      <li>When I apply this, my skin looks sooo much better</li>
      <li>Built in SPF 25, what&#x27;s not to love.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I apply Etude House CC cream on top of it</li>
      <li>The whitening part in this cream also covers my blemishes much better.</li>
      <li>I like this one: it does everything it claims to do (not so sure about wrinkles</li>
      <li>Face conditioning cream light makes you feel more lightly when you put on the item on your skin.&amp;#34; ... yeah... still don&#x27;t get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nothing strong</li>
      <li>Shortly thereafter, she was raving about what a great lotion it was, &amp;</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly as I would have hoped.</li>
      <li>To be honest, I like this product I really do.</li>
      <li>you please tell me what the difference is between the face conditioning cream and the face conditioning cream light?</li>
      <li>Applying the product wasnt&#x27; as smooth as I was expecting, and it takes awhile for the product to absorb.</li>
      <li>Whenever I get free samples with my purchases, I always share them with my mother, so I can get her opinion on the item too.  </li>
      <li>I have the blur face and the smooth pore egg from tonymoly, this isn&#x27;t quite like those products.</li>
      <li>Initially I was worried about buying this Korean product, having relatively dark skin, but I hear so many great things about Étude House, and with good reason!&lt;br /&gt;After two days of using this product, I noticed how smooth and even my face has become.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need a whole lot, too! :)</li>
      <li>but it feels kind of like a soft minty feel.</li>
      <li>this product arrived I tested it on my skin and noticed that it felt cool on my skin</li>
      <li>So its a great primer for foundation or bb cream and removes redness, but on its own can tend to dry out/flake and make your face ghostly white.</li>
      <li>What I like the most about this cream is that my skin looks more moist and glowly after I apply my makeup rather than matte and dry.</li>
      <li>to the US Etude House site, their Face Conditioning Cream &amp;#34;is a quick and easy makeup boosting cream that smoothly conditions skin with its light and soft texture for a makeup-ready complexion&amp;#34;.... yeah, that description didn&#x27;t really help me either.  </li>
      <li>The whitening isn&#x27;t that obvious, but the scent is nice and it feels moisturizing as well.</li>
      <li>I still had old acne scars but for the most part, my skin was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Apparently, based on my mother&#x27;s reaction - you can wear it with or without makeup! :)&lt;</li>
      <li>) Apparently, based on my mother&#x27;s reaction - you can wear it with or without makeup! :)&lt;</li>
      <li>Got a free sample of this stuff with a previous purchase, fell it love with it, and immediately bought a full size tube.  </li>
      <li>and I have to do all of my skin care stuff first.</li>
      <li>First, I&#x27;d like to let you guys know this product is not a miracle BB cream or foundation.</li>
      <li>So you just use your toner and apply this and go straight to your makeup or moisturizer!</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t know what I bought at first.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with my purchase and will definitely be buying this, or the pink one, again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with my purchase and will definitely be buying this, or the pink one, again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin (as many mexicans/hispanics/latinas do) and not only that</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t say much for the whitening aspect, but the cream feels nice and surprisingly light on my face even though it&#x27;s so thick.</li>
      <li>Its very hydrating and is not oily like.</li>
      <li>Its very creamy and is not as liquidy as people would expect.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After much research this is what I found:&lt;br /&gt;1.)</li>
      <li>But I couldn&#x27;t really see the differences between a face sunscreen and the face conditioning cream.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this product.</li>
      <li>really like this product.</li>
      <li>it gets really tiring sometimes.</li>
      <li>The Conditioning cream is not oily, and keeps the moisture on my face very even.</li>
      <li>I really like this cream and will repurchase it when I&#x27;m done.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t really need it.</li>
      <li>I actually don&#x27;t like the matte finish and prefer a more glowly natural finish.</li>
      <li>My make up went on so much smoother and my pores were less visible because of the better coverage I got with my BB cream (foundation replacement).</li>
      <li>and when I first applied it, it caused a soft tingling sensation.</li>
      <li>I have a pale, Asian skin and this conditioning cream makes my skin glow, toned and bright.</li>
      <li>so I had high expectations.</li>
      <li>However, its not thick either so its not something that would clog porew.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth it to extra plump your skin for a smoother effect .</li>
      <li>The color of the fluid is white, but it was easily blended with my skin.</li>
      <li>but I live in South Texas</li>
      <li>It was made to give &amp;#34;more conditioned&amp;#34;, vivid, and brighter skin tone rather than covering the skin complexion.</li>
      <li>SPF is a nice thing too.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say anything about it being too white: I have very pale skin</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, but have no problems with the &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; one.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Use to much and your face will turn white.</li>
      <li>this does leave your skin soft and evens some of my scars which I appreciate.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, but have no problems with the &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; one.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I mean, we cannot expect all of these magical functions from BB cream or conditioning balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like to use either Eucerin face cream, or Aveeno positively radiant depending on how dry or flakey my skin is that day.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s so much in this little container because you don&#x27;t need to use a lot to spread around the whole face.</li>
      <li>also because it&#x27;s a fairly thick product only a small amount is needed: if you use over a pea size this will catch and highlight pores and dry spots.. combination/dry types this is not the ideal product for you.</li>
      <li>however i have combination-oily skin and my new moisturizer has been keeping my dry spots in check, so using this product has been no problem.</li>

    <li> Doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly as I would have hoped. I have the blur face and the smooth pore egg from tonymoly, this isn&#x27;t quite like those products. Leaves my skin kind of sticky and cakey feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...I really wanted to like this product.</li>
    <li> Perfect in combination with a bb cushion</li>
    <li> Not too too thick or greasy. After I wash my face, I wear it under my makeup all day. My face looks like it has brightened up over the for the couple of months I&#x27;ve used this.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I like this product I really do. The only reason I gave it two stars is because it broke my skin out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have very oily skin (as many mexicans/hispanics/latinas do) and not only that but I live in South Texas so I&#x27;m constantly sweating and out in the sun so as a result my skin has always been acne prone. However, I had started using the Etude House baking soda wash and my skin had been clearing up and under control. I still had old acne scars but for the most part, my skin was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this product arrived I tested it on my skin and noticed that it felt cool on my skin and when I first applied it, it caused a soft tingling sensation.Nothing strong but it feels kind of like a soft minty feel. After a few days of using this product I had noticed my skin was breaking out but didn&#x27;t immediately connect it to the cream until my Mom brought it up. I decided to test it and so I used it for a few more days and my skin kept getting worse. I stopped using it for about 2 weeks and my skin got better. I used it again today and I broke out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This honestly stinks because this cream faded my acne scars and evened out my complexion tone. It also helped my make up go on smoother, but I won&#x27;t say it made it last longer. This product also helps to brighten your face, however it does leave it semi-shiny looking.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product I&#x27;m thrilled to have found it. As much as I love perfect skin I hate doing the skin care routine it gets really tiring sometimes. Especially when I am in a hurry to put on make up and I have to do all of my skin care stuff first. This cream basically combines the sunscreen and primer step and brightens as well. So you just use your toner and apply this and go straight to your makeup or moisturizer! If you have problem skin then use another primer on top of the conditioning cream for better coverage. My make up went on so much smoother and my pores were less visible because of the better coverage I got with my BB cream (foundation replacement). What I like the most about this cream is that my skin looks more moist and glowly after I apply my makeup rather than matte and dry. I actually don&#x27;t like the matte finish and prefer a more glowly natural finish. The whitening part in this cream also covers my blemishes much better.</li>
    <li> It does brighten the skin somewhat, and prevents your makeup/bb cream from oxidizing and turning dark. It provides negligible coverage, which is odd given how heavy and tacky the consistency of the product is. Applying the product wasnt&#x27; as smooth as I was expecting, and it takes awhile for the product to absorb. I&#x27;ll probably finish off this tube and try something else.</li>
    <li> I like this one: it does everything it claims to do (not so sure about wrinkles, I don&#x27;t have any) so 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin with nothing that needs concealing except for a few reddish patches. I apply this after moisturizer (patting, not rubbing motions) and I like the result: it brightens my face, evens the redness a little bit and I usually don&#x27;t even use any foundation. Sometimes I apply Etude House CC cream on top of it but I don&#x27;t really need it. SPF is a nice thing too.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say anything about it being too white: I have very pale skin so it blends in nicely :)</li>
    <li> First, I&#x27;d like to let you guys know this product is not a miracle BB cream or foundation. It was made to give &amp;#34;more conditioned&amp;#34;, vivid, and brighter skin tone rather than covering the skin complexion. The color of the fluid is white, but it was easily blended with my skin. I have a pale, Asian skin and this conditioning cream makes my skin glow, toned and bright. Even though it is written &amp;#34;brightening, anti-wrinkle and UV protection,&amp;#34; in Korean, I don&#x27;t think it works as it claimed because of its low potency. I mean, we cannot expect all of these magical functions from BB cream or conditioning balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this conditioning balm is excellent for the people who look for a &amp;#34;non-make up&amp;#34; kinda looking face. If you have blemishes or redness in your skin, I think you will need additional BB cream. If you have even-toned skin, then just adding this conditioning balm after sun screen will be enough for glowing skin. P.S: I have a Caucasian friend who tried this, and it also looks good on her.</li>
    <li> I love it, it&#x27;s perfect for Asianic skin. The whitening isn&#x27;t that obvious, but the scent is nice and it feels moisturizing as well. I&#x27;m a combination skin type and this fit me perfectly.</li>
    <li> I love this face conditioner. Its very hydrating and is not oily like. Its very creamy and is not as liquidy as people would expect. However, its not thick either so its not something that would clog porew. It gives a slight white tint in it which helps slightly brighten up the skin.</li>
    <li> I love the product! I like how it has sunscreen and whitening properties that can help prep my skin before foundation! When I apply this, my skin looks sooo much better and I feel like I could just wear this and just go about my day! You don&#x27;t need a whole lot, too! :)</li>
    <li> I really like this cream and will repurchase it when I&#x27;m done. I really can&#x27;t say much for the whitening aspect, but the cream feels nice and surprisingly light on my face even though it&#x27;s so thick.</li>
    <li> Initially I was worried about buying this Korean product, having relatively dark skin, but I hear so many great things about Étude House, and with good reason!&lt;br /&gt;After two days of using this product, I noticed how smooth and even my face has become. I seldom wear foundation because of this product. I don&#x27;t think anyone will regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> it makes your face looks brighter and smoother</li>
    <li> I really like it. It does work well using this as a base before putting on foundation or bb cream. But I couldn&#x27;t really see the differences between a face sunscreen and the face conditioning cream. Both gave me the same results. I used Neutrogena sheer face sunscreen and it works the same as the conditioning cream. So, if you want to save a couple of bucks, I suggest you buy the Neutrogena sheer face sunscreen (plus you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to ship).</li>
    <li> There was a lot of hype so I had high expectations. It&#x27;s nice, smells like sunblock sort of. I feel like it may have made my skin break out. But not sure.</li>
    <li> great smell, but it does not work very well for me. not ovbious changes of before and after....</li>
    <li> Got a free sample of this stuff with a previous purchase, fell it love with it, and immediately bought a full size tube.  Whenever I get free samples with my purchases, I always share them with my mother, so I can get her opinion on the item too.  Not much information is provided on the little samples (I assume, due to lack of room on the little packet), and, without any sort of explanation, gave my mom 2 packets of this face conditioning cream.  Shortly thereafter, she was raving about what a great lotion it was, &amp;#34;it makes my skin look and feel so good!!&amp;#34;.  Then I had to break it to her... &amp;#34;it&#x27;s not lotion Mom...&amp;#34;, but she didn&#x27;t care, she still loved it. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the US Etude House site, their Face Conditioning Cream &amp;#34;is a quick and easy makeup boosting cream that smoothly conditions skin with its light and soft texture for a makeup-ready complexion&amp;#34;.... yeah, that description didn&#x27;t really help me either.  From my understanding, the cream is applied under your makeup, like a primer.  I was unclear about how the word &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; was being used - so I contacted Etude House and asked:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Dear Etude House Team,&lt;br /&gt;Can you please tell me what the difference is between the face conditioning cream and the face conditioning cream light? Thank you so much!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Etude&#x27;s Reply:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Thank you for your interest on our product. Face conditioning cream light makes you feel more lightly when you put on the item on your skin.&amp;#34; ... yeah... still don&#x27;t get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After much research this is what I found:&lt;br /&gt;1.) Provides sebum control and makes your makeup last all day.&lt;br /&gt;2.) Turns your face into a perfect palette, making your makeup/skin look even better.&lt;br /&gt;3.) The Blue one is for regular/normal skin&lt;br /&gt;4.) The Pink one is for oily/combination skin&lt;br /&gt;5.) There are two sizes (not including the sample size): 75 g (should be aprx $12) and a &amp;#34;Mini&amp;#34; that is 40 g (should be around $8)&lt;br /&gt;6.) Apparently, based on my mother&#x27;s reaction - you can wear it with or without makeup! :)&lt;br /&gt;7.) I have sensitive skin, but have no problems with the &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with my purchase and will definitely be buying this, or the pink one, again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have already recommended to friends and family members.nd $8)&lt;br /&gt;6.)

    <li> Love this product, good moisture and sunscreen. Gives my skin a nice texture.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it brightens the skin but gives a slight white cast. it works if you&#x27;re pale but otherwise be careful! this does leave your skin soft and evens some of my scars which I appreciate. also because it&#x27;s a fairly thick product only a small amount is needed: if you use over a pea size this will catch and highlight pores and dry spots.. combination/dry types this is not the ideal product for you. however i have combination-oily skin and my new moisturizer has been keeping my dry spots in check, so using this product has been no problem. I personally use this base by itself and my skin remains &amp;#34;bright&amp;#34; all day long. i recommend it but only to normal/oily types just to make life easier.</li>
    <li> I purchased this along with the Etude house Bright and Fit BB Cream. I tried to use this for a day without the bb cream, and then the next day I used just the bb cream. The conditioning cream does slightly even your skin tone, but it does so by whitening it. My complexion is very pale, with pink undertones, and I have very dry sensitive skin. The Conditioning cream is not oily, and keeps the moisture on my face very even. This Contitioning Cream removed the pinkness from my face, so it was disproportionate from the rest of my body, so the bb cream helped add color to my face. I also recommend using regular moisturizer if you have dry skin that is prone to flake before you put on this conditioner. I like to use either Eucerin face cream, or Aveeno positively radiant depending on how dry or flakey my skin is that day. So its a great primer for foundation or bb cream and removes redness, but on its own can tend to dry out/flake and make your face ghostly white.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know what I bought at first. Read the directions, and played with it. I think of this a primer, before the actual primer. You can use this after your daily night routine or before you start with an actual primer. A little goes a long way. Use to much and your face will turn white. Apply a little, and I add primer ; think of your face a blank canvas, it gives my face a start . Built in SPF 25, what&#x27;s not to love. I pair this with my Etude House Face Blur.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!! There&#x27;s so much in this little container because you don&#x27;t need to use a lot to spread around the whole face. Definitely will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product is great at smoothing your skin , however there isn&#x27;t much of a whitening effect as I have hoped . It&#x27;s a face conditioning cream , but there are others like the one in Wishtrend that worked better than this one . However for the price it&#x27;s worth it to extra plump your skin for a smoother effect . Always use with a brush or a sponge , if you use with just your hand prepare for some disaster .</li>
    <li> really like this product. it moisturizes and brightens my face. don&#x27;t even use BB cream on a daily basis anymore</li>
    <li> Good product...it brighten my face.</li>
    <li> product as described and well packaged for delivery!</li>
    <li> The best face conditioning cream produced ever ! Whitens and condition your face while prepping it for the foundation of the rest of your makeup !</li>
