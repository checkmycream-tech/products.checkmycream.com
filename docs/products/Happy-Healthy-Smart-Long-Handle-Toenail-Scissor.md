      <li>These also allow for more precise cuts.</li>

      <li>While the added length was helpful, the scissors themselves did not cut easily.  </li>
      <li>These are surprisingly comfortable, I can fit all of my fingers in the handles as needed.</li>

      <li>altho she is more than willing to do so.  </li>
      <li>These will be replacing my old set of clippers for sure!  </li>
      <li>The angled blades are really cleverly designed, so that I’m able to get fine detail into the corners of my nail by angling the blade.  </li>
      <li>As a leftie, many scissors are difficult to use with my left hand, but I&#x27;m really happy that these work perfectly with either hand!  </li>

      <li>These clippers are my new favorite to use for trimming my toenails.  </li>
      <li>I really like these Smart Long Handle Toenail Scissors by Happy Healthy Smart.</li>

      <li>I am hoping some day to be able to visit my pedicurist again, but at 90 years old it might not happen.</li>
      <li>Another great addition to this pair of toenail clipper scissors is the size of the holes for our fingers, it does not feel awkward in the hand and they provide a nice grip.</li>
      <li>I just didn’t understand why I would need long-handled toenail clippers, since I normally just use the small metal style (the type where you rotate the top to get it to be able to clip) and thought those were working fine.  </li>
      <li>I like this nail clipper very much.</li>
      <li>so I don’t have to bend over as much, which is great especially on days when my back is feeling sore.  </li>
      <li>I really like these!</li>
      <li>Can be a little bit wobbly but in general they work great.</li>
      <li>The blades on this sissor are sharp enough, but more length, more curve in the blade area could&#x27;ve been engineered into the design.  </li>
      <li>It is especially useful for the sides of the nail, where odd pieces need to be trimmed.</li>
      <li>I even tried them on myself and they were strong enough to cut through my toenails.  </li>
      <li>and I really think these are going to solve that</li>
      <li>Not as much of a help as I had hoped</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t have to bend as much to cut my toenails.  </li>
      <li>It really makes it so much easier for me to do it for myself and not have to ask my husband to do it</li>
      <li>Handle flux is too much when you were trying to cut.</li>
      <li>4.5” of straight metal before the 1” angled blade) make it</li>
      <li>and I thought these would help......but not so much.  </li>
      <li>These toenail clippers are very well made and durable.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>They are made very sturdy and durable.  </li>
      <li>Unless the one I received was defective, these scissors have a rather blunt tip, more like 2 mm wide.  </li>
      <li>Normal sized finger holes!  </li>
      <li>and I highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>High quality item.</li>
      <li>maybe just use a little more care than I did.  </li>
      <li>The scissors is sharp and easily trims the nails.</li>
      <li>They can easily cut toenails due to the jagged edge of one side.  </li>
      <li>They are great for people like me who find it difficult to bend over to trim my toenails.</li>
      <li>Plus, any pregnant lady can appreciate the long handles.</li>
      <li>I have never tried long handle toenail scissors before, but now being 9 months pregnant</li>
      <li>I just wish they were a little better made ie professional grade.</li>
      <li>I am not excited thus far,  but maybe in time I will feel better about this purchase.  </li>
      <li>Really these are so easy to use that I won’t be going back to the other style of clippers for my toenails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not very strong, works great on soft toe nails, but will not work on hard nails.</li>
      <li>, what can I say I enjoy the little things in life.  </li>
      <li>First of all the long handles (the purple portion is 2.5” then</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These are a great long handle toenail scissors.  The handle is 8 1/2 inches long.  They are comfortable to use and a lot better than a normal toenail clipper.  The scissors cut very nicely and with ease.  They are made very sturdy and durable.  The handle fits any size hands.  These are great for using when I give myself pedicures.  I did receive these at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.  This review is a 100% my own opinion and was not compensated in any way.  I completely recommend these Long Handle Toenail Scissors for anyone, male or female.</li>
    <li> I like these scissors. The long handle is a breakthrough in technology! I just wish they were a little better made ie professional grade. Still, I am happy with my purchase. The scissors are sharp and work well.</li>
    <li> Good length, very sturdy, easy to use.  Normal sized finger holes!  High quality item.</li>
    <li> I am loving the reach I get from these toenail clippers! For at home pedicures this is the pair of toenail scissors I grab for - Not only is the reach on them beyond helpful but I am loving how comfortable and easy they are to use!  The long handled toenail scissors are a big help to me but also to my mom, who is older and often wheelchair bound. She complains when I try to help her cut her toenails but clearly struggled cutting her toenails with a standard toenail clipper. I know she just wanted to be able to cut them on her own without help.  My mom tried these toenail scissors out and loved them as well. She was able to reach down slightly in her wheelchair and use the length of the scissors to complete the job herself! She has thick toenails and the scissors cut right through them, they are very sharp! The edge of the blade is serrated so I will file her nails out when she is finished to smooth out any areas that need it and paint her toenails up. She looks forward to the days we spend together and always alerts me when she thinks she is due for another toenail scissor trim. We both use these scissors often! Another great addition to this pair of toenail clipper scissors is the size of the holes for our fingers, it does not feel awkward in the hand and they provide a nice grip. A very awesome handy tool! Sample provided for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> These clippers are my new favorite to use for trimming my toenails.  Honestly I was a little bit skeptical at first - I just didn’t understand why I would need long-handled toenail clippers, since I normally just use the small metal style (the type where you rotate the top to get it to be able to clip) and thought those were working fine.  Well yes those technically can do the job, but these Happy Healthy Smart clippers are so much easier.  First of all the long handles (the purple portion is 2.5” then 4.5” of straight metal before the 1” angled blade) make it so I don’t have to bend over as much, which is great especially on days when my back is feeling sore.  The angled blades are really cleverly designed, so that I’m able to get fine detail into the corners of my nail by angling the blade.  The blades themselves are very sharp and can easily get through thick or oddly shaped nails.  As a leftie, many scissors are difficult to use with my left hand, but I&#x27;m really happy that these work perfectly with either hand!  Really these are so easy to use that I won’t be going back to the other style of clippers for my toenails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m very happy that I was able to order this for free as a promotional sample in order to evaluate and provide my honest review.</li>
    <li> These are surprisingly comfortable, I can fit all of my fingers in the handles as needed. They are strong and very sharp, great for cutting the annoying hangnails on my husband. Plus, any pregnant lady can appreciate the long handles. Nothing better than a utensil that saves you from having to bend over more than you have to. They are best for toenails, because they can cut a clean, straight line. Also good for nail touch-ups between regular clippings.&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
    <li> I really like these Smart Long Handle Toenail Scissors by Happy Healthy Smart. They are great for people like me who find it difficult to bend over to trim my toenails. The nails on my big toes are very hard and difficult to trim with regular nail clippers, but the Toenail Scissors cut right through them with no problem. These toenail clippers are very well made and durable. The blades are made of steel and should last a long time if taken care of. The handle grips are nice and comfortable when you use them. I was impressed with these scissors and I highly recommend them. This is my honest opinion after trying this product</li>
    <li> Excellent product that helps you take care of yourself, which can mean the world to a lot of people.</li>
    <li> I have never tried long handle toenail scissors before, but now being 9 months pregnant it is much harder to reach and cut my toenails using traditional clippers. I did find that with some practice, I was able to cut my toenails and reach! The scissors did the job and I was able to even get into corners to prevent ingrown nails. Overall I am pleased with this innovative product. I do think it takes some getting use to. I received this product for review and inspection purposes in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Unless the one I received was defective, these scissors have a rather blunt tip, more like 2 mm wide.  There is NO way these can be used to cut toe nails, let alone getting into where ingrown toe nails are.  I was extremely disappointed as I thought I had finally found the right tools to help me avoid visits to the podiatrist&#x27;s office!&lt;br /&gt;The pair of scissors pictured below THIS item has more of a pointy tip I was looking for and I had expected that these Happy Healthy Smart …  toenail scissors would be pointier, flatter, and narrower at the tip.</li>
    <li> I am not excited thus far,  but maybe in time I will feel better about this purchase.  I experienced severe spinal surgery (scoliosis birth defect) some 18 months ago.  Extremely serious for 75 yrs of age.  The rods from neck to pelvis do not allow bending and I thought these would help......but not so much.  I  hate to ask daughter to do my pedicure altho she is more than willing to do so.  So my review is perhaps not fair.</li>
    <li> Hip arthritis prohibits bending.  If you want to clip that last pinky toe, forget it.  The blades on this sissor are sharp enough, but more length, more curve in the blade area could&#x27;ve been engineered into the design.  This design may look good, but is essentially thoughtless for anyone who has joint probs.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know they made toenail clippers like this but I&#x27;m very glad that they do.  I have had 3 back surgeries and suffer from bad low back pain.  I have lot a bit of mobility and can&#x27;t bend for very long without having a lot of pain.  These are perfect for me because they are so much longer so I don&#x27;t have to bend as much to cut my toenails.  It really makes it so much easier for me to do it for myself and not have to ask my husband to do it (although he doesn&#x27;t mind and I usually get a nice long foot rub when he&#x27;s finished).  On second thought, maybe I should get HIM to start using these because I sure would hate to lose my foot rubs.  Also these are very well made of stainless steel, are the perfect shape and the handle has a nice grip.  These will be replacing my old set of clippers for sure!  Sample received for testing, evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> Not very strong, works great on soft toe nails, but will not work on hard nails.</li>
    <li> If you have arthritis and can&#x60;t reach your toes these are great</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with  this product.  Did not do the job for me.  Wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I got these to help with cutting my little one&#x27;s finger and toe nails.  I&#x27;m always terrified to use nail clippers since I&#x27;ve accidentally nicked him before.  These are very strong scissors.  They can easily cut toenails due to the jagged edge of one side.  I even tried them on myself and they were strong enough to cut through my toenails.  I&#x27;m so glad that I was chosen to recieve these for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Handle flux is too much when you were trying to cut. They&#x27;re kind of chintzy in my opinion.</li>
    <li> As mentioned previously, the blade is too wide to cut nails that may be shorter but still need clipping. If you have this issue and are purchasing for that reason, this is not the product for you.</li>
    <li> It may work on a ladies nails but it hasn&#x27;t a chance against my male toenails which are quite thick. This time I was fooled by the &amp;#34;reviews&amp;#34; that I read on the scissors. I guess the nail salon will continue to get my business.</li>
    <li> My husband has terrible trouble reaching his toenails to cut them - I usually do it for him.  As soon as he opened your scissors, he checked it out and was able to cut his toenails easily. He loved them!</li>
    <li> Not as much of a help as I had hoped but it did help</li>
    <li> Very nice. Works great</li>
    <li> I like this nail clipper very much. It is especially useful for the sides of the nail, where odd pieces need to be trimmed. The sharp point also allows cuticle cutting with ease.&lt;br /&gt;The length of these scissors also means that when trimming toes, your back is not as hunched over which is really  nice. I was offered this product at a reduced cost for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;I would not hesitate to recommend this product based on quality, petformance  and construction.&lt;br /&gt;This is a welcome addition to my manicure tools collection. Great for fingernails, too.</li>
    <li> Extremely sharp, with so much leverage that cutting toenails is virtually effortless!  Great deal for the money.  For twice the price, it could be more robust, but it works perfectly just as it is.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> These scissors are great. During the past year and a half I have suffered a broken hip and broken knee cap along with severe arthritis in the knee. It is impossible for me to bend very far, but now with the toenail scissors I can at least keep the toenails cut down. I am hoping some day to be able to visit my pedicurist again, but at 90 years old it might not happen.</li>
    <li> I really like these! I can now reach all my toenails in a comfortable manner with great control to keep my foot hygene where it should be.</li>
    <li> Really helped me reach my toenails after major back surgery. Can be a little bit wobbly but in general they work great.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like them. I tried cutting toenails with them but they don&#x27;t cut well at all.</li>
    <li> Bought to trim candle wicks. Works great!</li>
    <li> Works great, long handles, good finger, thumb openings. Only wish it also came in  a plainer color.</li>
    <li> I think I would love thee solely based on the fact that they are purple, what can I say I enjoy the little things in life.  Now, let&#x27;s get down t o business.  I have never used scissors to cut my toenails before.  When I use traditional toe nail clippers inevitably I end up clipping one side shorter than the other, so the other side grows out faster and I have lopsided toenails and that is just not a good look, on anyone. I decided to give these bad boys a try and not only did the work great on my little toes, but my big toe was no match for these! I often get ingrown toenails on my big toes because I clip unevenly and I really think these are going to solve that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution.....these are VERY sharp.  I learned that the hard way when I decided I would use these to cut a callous off of my big toe. What I did NOT take into consideration is how sharp these are, lesson learned.  This is in no way, shape or form a reflection on the product, but on my own stupidity.  BUT they are freaking amazing at cutting off unsightly callouses....maybe just use a little more care than I did.  And keep these away from little ones!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I  received this product free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Love this scissors for reaching toes.  Hip flexors are not as flexible as they once were so reaching the toes is difficult.  The scissors is sharp and easily trims the nails.</li>
    <li> Just not strong enough to cut.</li>
    <li> Great toenail scissors. I no longer had hand strength for regular trimmers. These also allow for more precise cuts.</li>
    <li> While the added length was helpful, the scissors themselves did not cut easily.  I would not purchase again if given the chance.</li>
