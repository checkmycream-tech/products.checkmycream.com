      <li>Love this ointment!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad that I did!</li>
      <li>Unlike sprays or creams, this lotion feels great, makes my feet feel awesome, and it moisturizes all at the same time.</li>
      <li>While potentially effective, the material was greasy.</li>
      <li>The large tube is great.  </li>
      <li>This product works better than prescriptions I received.</li>
      <li>An ok product but does not work well for me.</li>
      <li>sk for better.  </li>
      <li>Worked better than the doctor prescribed creams for me.</li>
      <li>Most athletes foot</li>
      <li>more words needed</li>
      <li>Seems to work better then products without the aloe vera.</li>
      <li>Keeps the feet nice and smooth and protects them as well.</li>
      <li>goes on nice and smooth, no unpleasant odor.</li>
      <li>Seems to be pretty effective.</li>
      <li>Works fine as advertised.  </li>
      <li>In the nursing home we would also use this product under large women&#x27;s breasts to help clear up yeast infections with very good results.</li>
      <li>This lotion is great for dry, cracked feet.</li>
      <li>As a lotion it works great but as far as an antifungal cream not so much.</li>
      <li>but, I haven&#x27;t used enough of it to give a really good review.</li>
      <li>It seems to work better than the products available in stores locally.  </li>

      <li>Very soothing to irritated skin also.</li>
      <li>Very helpful in using on areas that are prone to fungal irritations.</li>
      <li>Went through a ringworm nightmare in my home from a stray kitten we brought in, both dogs and all 3 kids and 3 adults got infected, we tried a few other creams that worked well, this one was great and it really helps when it itches, it has a petroleum jelly consistency and soothes itch on contact.</li>
      <li>It felt much better on the skin than the medications I had used previously and it worked quicker too.</li>
      <li>Works well for mild incontinence protection and treating moisture related issues under skin flaps and in folds.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend both these products as it cleared up my jock itch.  </li>
      <li>about 1/2 the size and does not work nearly as well.</li>
      <li>As far as &amp;#34;Does</li>
      <li>It does a decent job against a fungus but only part of the product is an ointment.</li>
      <li>twice a day and then completely dry the area with a blow dryer (much to my GF&#x27;s amusement)  and then apply the the Aloe Vesta Antifungal ointment .  </li>
      <li>I have tried several products similar to this because I take a medication which makes my urine very, very strong and irritating.  </li>
      <li>This is not too bad, but not as good as prescription ointment/1</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a very effective product.  It seems to work better than the products available in stores locally.  I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb! Unlike sprays or creams, this lotion feels great, makes my feet feel awesome, and it moisturizes all at the same time. Best of all, you don&#x27;t use a lot of the product for results. I&#x27;ll be buying this over and over.</li>
    <li> This product works better than prescriptions I received.</li>
    <li> It does a decent job against a fungus but only part of the product is an ointment. The other part is a clear, runny oil that spills out as soon as you open the cap. It separates into solids and liquids in only 2 weeks. I know because I found a small wire and stirred it (like a can of paint that had been sitting on the shelf for 5 years) and then tried it again 2 weeks later. I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Came on time and works well. I like that it keeps the skin moisturized and doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell.</li>
    <li> Works well, aides healing and prevents infections on wet wounds or dey.</li>
    <li> Works as described. Seems to work better then products without the aloe vera. You also can&#x27;t beat the price/size combo in store.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to work any different than any other ointment</li>
    <li> Works fine as advertised.  The large tube is great.  Painful itch is abated almost immediately.</li>
    <li> While potentially effective, the material was greasy.</li>
    <li> Does the trick. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> As advertised...it works.</li>
    <li> Very helpful in using on areas that are prone to fungal irritations.</li>
    <li> My mother-in-law is 90, has diabetes, is blind. and cannot stand.  Her back would break out in a rash and she would cry from the itching.  We tried doctor prescriptions and over the counter creams, nothing worked.  This ointment is put on her daily and she can finally rest and sleep.</li>
    <li> Love this ointment! goes on nice and smooth, no unpleasant odor.</li>
    <li> like in the hospital and cheaper than name brands in drug stores and Wal-Mart.</li>
    <li> As a lotion it works great but as far as an antifungal cream not so much.</li>
    <li> Great for homebound person.</li>
    <li> Great, nateraul product. It works!!</li>
    <li> The tube design is different than the product photo.</li>
    <li> We always used this brand of products when I worked as a nurse so I trust the brand. The bottle itself is very large. Most athletes foot cream tubes are tiny and you need to  buy multiply expensive tubes until your issue is gone. This cleared my athletes foot and also helped to moisturize. I would buy this product again. In the nursing home we would also use this product under large women&#x27;s breasts to help clear up yeast infections with very good results.</li>
    <li> good for your antifungal</li>
    <li> Works well for mild incontinence protection and treating moisture related issues under skin flaps and in folds. Very soothing to irritated skin also.</li>
    <li> this ointment is very effective.</li>
    <li> Best price I&#x27;ve found for this item.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it sooths pain away.  more words needed but these are all my thoughts for now</li>
    <li> recommended by my wound doctor and it works great.</li>
    <li> This has been helpful but, I haven&#x27;t used enough of it to give a really good review.</li>
    <li> not particularly effective</li>
    <li> I used this and the Tea Tree antifungal soap because I had recurring jock itch for the past two years and the pharmaceutical products like Lamisil only worked temporarily.  I highly recommend both these products as it cleared up my jock itch.  I would wash with the anti fungal tee tree oil soap twice a day and then completely dry the area with a blow dryer (much to my GF&#x27;s amusement)  and then apply the the Aloe Vesta Antifungal ointment .  It felt much better on the skin than the medications I had used previously and it worked quicker too. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s feet crack and split when she gets athlete&#x27;s foot. She finds this to be a soothing treatment, and will use it reliably until her condition is controlled.</li>
    <li> great for yeast and fungus!</li>
    <li> This is not too bad, but not as good as prescription ointment/1</li>
    <li> Great results!  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> This lotion is great for dry, cracked feet. I actually had a sore blister from shoes and the blister just didn&#x27;t seem to want to heal. I remembered I had this lotion so I decided to try it out--and I&#x27;m glad that I did! It worked wonderfully and my blister healed in no time.</li>
    <li> ....works well on dry skin, rashes, and some funguses......</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Very speedy delivery! Thank You!</li>
    <li> An ok product but does not work well for me.</li>
    <li> To runnie, had trouble getting it from hand to chest an it didn&#x27;t stop the itch.</li>
    <li> Helps a lot with itchy skin</li>
    <li> Went through a ringworm nightmare in my home from a stray kitten we brought in, both dogs and all 3 kids and 3 adults got infected, we tried a few other creams that worked well, this one was great and it really helps when it itches, it has a petroleum jelly consistency and soothes itch on contact.</li>
    <li> The price may make you think twice about ordering this item, but don&#x27;t hesitate. It lasts a lot longer then you would think. I ordered 3 tubes over 1.5 months ago, I&#x27;m still using the first tube. As far as &amp;#34;Does it work&amp;#34;, yes it works great. It may take sometime, 2-4 weeks.</li>
    <li> Keeps the feet nice and smooth and protects them as well.</li>
    <li> This package arrived to my home empty. Never got to try it</li>
    <li> Seems to be pretty effective. You wouldn&#x27;t think that a petroleum jelly based product would work, but count me as convinced.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great!</li>
    <li> Worked better than the doctor prescribed creams for me.</li>
    <li> I have tried several products similar to this because I take a medication which makes my urine very, very strong and irritating.  NOTHING has worked half as well as this product.  I would advise anyone who is using other wipes and ointments to try this immediately.  The only product that comes close costs $25 for a tube about 1/2 the size and does not work nearly as well.</li>
    <li> I continue to order this item, as it helps with my foot issue.</li>
    <li> Could not a Excellent Product.  Almost Immediate Relief/Healing.  Shake well before use.  Some separation does occur.  sk for better.  Virtually</li>
