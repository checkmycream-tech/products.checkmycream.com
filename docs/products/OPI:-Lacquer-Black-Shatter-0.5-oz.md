      <li>but i added a splash of nail polish remover to it and it was good as ever.</li>

      <li>This polish works good</li>
      <li>Good price, cheaper to buy on Amazon than to pay for it at the salon.</li>
      <li>Loved experimenting with this nail polish.</li>
      <li>This polish is so cool, gives an awesome look to any color nails.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m sure my granddaughter will be delighted, however.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice but not to die for as advertised everywhere</li>
      <li>Love love love it!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really a great product, and a unique polish.</li>

      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I am enjoying the polish ...</li>
      <li>Much better than fighting with trying to get stickers on her or painting a design myself.</li>
      <li>But this is a problem with most nail polishes.</li>
      <li>Make sure you shake the polish vigously before you apply to each nail.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>Also, using a top coat over it makes it look even better.</li>
      <li>that are like all in one top coat kinds</li>
      <li>She gets a lot of comments on her nails from people, really is cute.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had been looking for this nail polish for so long and I had tired looking for it on ebay but they were all so expensive but then I finally found it on amazon at the regular price and I immediately bought it and i have NO regrets. I love this nail polish and definitely recommend it, its so new and fresh and got so many compliments when i first wore it.</li>
    <li> good nail polish had it for about 3 weeks already. One problem that i have with it is that its already getting thick and clumpy. but overall its okay.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it. I have never seen anything like it. Just a single application and it starts cracking right in front of your eyes. I have a 4 year old that loves having her nails done. This is so quick and easy. Much better than fighting with trying to get stickers on her or painting a design myself. Love love love it!!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get this nail polish and I wasn&#x27;t dissapointed - you can get some really remarkable nails with this! For best results, try using shatter with metallic colors. The color you use underneath pretty much needs to be bright, so it might be an excuse to use your summer shades in the winter. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so people have mentioned that application is a little tricky. What you want to remember is not to go back and correct anything, because it&#x27;ll make the shatter too thick. Also, you want to be sure that the coat underneath is completely dry before you apply. This makes it a great \\&quot;refresher\\&quot; for a color you&#x27;re tired of after a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the reason this only got a 4/5 rather than 5/5. First, the scent is pretty horrendous. No way you&#x27;re going to do your manicure in a place with less-than-ideal ventilation. Second, the texture is thicker than I&#x27;d like. Once you get a base coat, two nail polish layers, shatter, and a top coat... well, it&#x27;s pretty thick. The shatter is approximately two times as thick as my nail polish (also OPI). Imagine the seche vite top coat, but you&#x27;re putting this -beneath- that. Still, if a little thickness doesn&#x27;t bother you or if you&#x27;re willing to perhaps cut a nail color coat (a.k.a. use a color that lets you do just one coat), then you&#x27;ll love the shatter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I looked on the site earlier today and saw that other colors are coming out. I think you&#x27;ll probably get the most utility out of black and white (or silver, if they have it), but if you&#x27;re looking for color diversification, take a look at the china glaze crackel polishes too. :)</li>
    <li> This is soooo cool well worth the cost. You have to experiment and find which colors and brands work best as the base color, I have found that saturated colors look better also nail polished that are like all in one top coat kinds dont work well. Also with the shatter you have to do a quick thin coat to reach the optimal results and if you miss a spot  dont try to fix it right away wait till its dry. Finally use a top coat!!!! it will turn out shinny and stay longer</li>
    <li> Loved experimenting with this nail polish. My only complaint would be it takes a bit of practice, as how much polish you have on the brush during application can make the effect vary. I found myself using it over really intense colors I wouldn&#x27;t usually wear. It looked the most fun over a really bright highlighter hot pink. It was nice over metallics as well!</li>
    <li> This is a great black crackle nailpolish. If you are getting any nailpolish i recommmend OPI. This doesnt look exactly like the pic when u put it on though. the cracks are more in straight lines going down than looking like the picture. It is still a great nailpolish though!</li>
    <li> This has to be the coolest nail polish ever. I love it....I like the fact that I can wear black and another color under it.it almost gives a cheetah vibe off. Fast shipping....and I feel like it doesn&#x27;t need to go on perfect it&#x27;s almost infailable</li>
    <li> This product, OPI Black Shatter, was given to my daughter, Janie as a gift.  Janie has used it and is very impressed with it!  Wonderful!  I do not regret purchasing this item for her.  No hidden qualities.</li>
    <li> I kept hearing the hype on this Shatter nail polish. It was so popular that it was sold out everywhere. I found it on Amazon and decided to buy. I love this polish. It instantly adds a little spice to any manicure. The only thing is use light colors for the base and only one coat of the Shatter.</li>
    <li> Gave up trying to find this in stores, having my name on waiting lists. No problem finding it on Amazon...loove it. So eay to use. cant mess it up. Have seen others wearing similiar polishes, not OPI...and i can see right away when its NOT OPI shattered. Looks cheap and tacky.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the black shatter!  It looks great on brights and pastels.  Was not impressed with the silver shatter but this is amazing!</li>
    <li> The black shatter really add some fun to my nail collection, it need to take your time to add the effect on dry nail, I am please about the product.</li>
    <li> Be prepared for great comments when wearing this polish.  Just be sure to use a top coat for a glossy shine.</li>
    <li> This was okay,  I really love the OPI color that supposedly goes with this one.  It&#x27;s my favorite and I reviewed it here as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Last nite, after posting the above review. I had on the nail polish that I stated is my favorite (OPI&#x27;s Not Like The Movies).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then shook OPI&#x27;s Black Shatter for about 3 good minutes.  I then applied thin to medium coats to my completely dry nails.  Voila!!! they are rocking right now!!!  It is truly in the application.  Make sure you shake the polish vigously before you apply to each nail.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying the polish ... it gives my nails a \\&quot;marbled\\&quot; effect, and hides the chips and dings that hit my nails on a daily basis ... easy to put on over a bright under color ... and I get lots of compliments !!</li>
    <li> This is a must-have for ladies that love having their nails designed, but can&#x27;t always afford a trip to the nail salon every week. This is even for the woman that does her own nails, but would like a quick design here and there. I knew I would love working with this nail polish after I saw so many YouTube videos reviewing it. It dries quickly and pairs great with a number of colors. The lighter the amount of polish you brush on the finer the &#x27;shatters.&#x27;</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Put a light coat on over your regular nail polish (any color) and it gives it a shatter effect.  Also it lasts a really long time.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product from a couple of people. It looked really interesting so I thought I would try it out. I have used it a couple times already and I have to say it is very fun to experiment with. But you might have to use it a couple times to get it the way you want. Also, using a top coat over it makes it look even better.</li>
    <li> OPI is consistently high quality. I love the way that this shatters on my nails and the color of it is so vivid. The only problem that I have had with this nail polish is that it dries very fast inside of the bottle and on the brush. After 6 or 7 uses, you will start to notice a thick, dry texture around the brush, making it hard to paint the nails. Cleaning off the brush after each use would probably be the best idea.</li>
    <li> I get a lot of compliments when I wear the Shatter and it&#x27;s such an easy way to do your nails and make them look as if you had them done at a salon!</li>
    <li> It will never look like the picture.</li>
    <li> Was very excited to receive my nail polish. I had been looking for the shatter in stores for a while and could not locate it. Was happy to get my hands on it. The product is great and definitely worth a little wait.</li>
    <li> This polish is amazing! My little girl has stayed up for nights changing her polish using this shatter polish!  It&#x27;s the latest craze! Moms if you don&#x27;t know about this stuff, get some for your daughters, they&#x27;ll love you for it!</li>
    <li> With this product... PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT!!! I love this product and the fact that you can do so much with it &#x3D;) but you cant just slap it on and go. You need your base coat of color and then let that dry FULLY! once thats dry put 1 SWIPE of shatter on and let it crackle. If you have it too think its just going to be a mess. so once you find just the right amount after lots of practice your nails will look and you will definetly get noticed. I recieve compliments all the time when im wearing it. The only downside is that ive found out the polish in the bottle dries up quite quickly so i buy a new bottle every 6 months to keep it at its best.</li>
    <li> Every brand of nail polish has tried to copy the shatter effect, but this is still the best. The black looks best over a silver (as in the picture) or a shimmery light blue. Also great to put over orange nails for Halloween.</li>
    <li> It was really difficult for me to find ANY shatter nail polish ANYWHERE for months - it was sold out at every store I checked! But it seems like OPI re-stocked a bunch of places mid-May, so I was able to find and buy the Black Shatter. The polish went on easily, but takes some finessing so it doesn&#x27;t come out streaky. With some practice, I was definitely happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I love it and I am sure you will too. The only concern I had was the application proccess. The thinner you put it on, the more cracks you will get. The thicker it is, the less cracks you will have and a bigger black mess will occur on your nails.  Great product though and I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is GREAT! I have tried a couple different brands for the undercoat and in all honesty it didn&#x27;t matter they all worked great with OPI Blk Shatter.     Useage: 9/10- Even with Suggested one coat it took a little longer then expected to dry.     Smell: 10/10- Doesn&#x27;t give off the usual icky nail polish smell. Not that it really matters.     Texture: 10/10- Even with my accidental brush against the wall when i thought the polish was dry, it still looked really good!       I painted my toes the night i got this and it still has not budged! From wearing closed toe heels, Flip flops, and even Vibram Five Finger toe shoes (gym use) not a single chip.     Personally this product gets a lovely 10/10 from me! I would suggest this to everyone! just make sure you give it an extra minute or two to dry completely.</li>
    <li> Great product! My first attempt at using shatter was great. I have to admit, though, that I did a lot of research on YouTube and Google before buying it. If you watch tutorials on how to use it, there shouldn&#x27;t be too many problems.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks :)</li>
    <li> I really like the OPI black shatter, at first it was great and i would apply it over my nails frequently, but i must say after a while the nail polish got really clumpy and i havent used it since. Not sure if it was just mine? i&#x27;ve heard different from others. Overall i like the shattering, its different and no need to waste money at the nail salon for designs &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> The OPI Shatter Nail Polishes are so much fun!  You can use them on top of a lighter colored nail polish and attain the shatter pattern.  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This polish is great when applied well, but doing so takes a bit of trial and error. I recommend that you begin with a very light coat and just add to the amount if the light coat doesn&#x27;t shatter the way you want.   Also, I agree with the other opinions that it thickens too quickly.</li>
    <li> Sally Hansen makes a better black shatter called black crackle.  This brand is horrible for shatter.  It is so thick and goopy like tar it is hard to apply and if u dont try just right the shattering will look like crap. They also have a line by opi called nicole..its so cheap looking. i honestly dont understand why opi is so expensive when sally hansen does just as good if not better! save your money.</li>
    <li> My OPI Black Shatter arrived promptly! I haven&#x27;t used the product just yet but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll love it after I practice a few times. Thanks for providing the product. I&#x27;m a happy customer and I&#x27;ll be ordering from this company again.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this nail polish, but it was a lot harder to apply and I can&#x27;t get it to look good.</li>
    <li> I wish I could tell you how awesome this nail polish is but I can&#x27;t.  I ordered this product on May 8th and it was supposed to be delivered between the 12th and the 17th.  Well today is the 18th, and I have no black shatter polish.  What a waste of money, don&#x27;t order it from this seller.</li>
    <li> The product is awesome. We had tried to find it for over a month. Everyone that has seen my girls wear it has asked where we got it. I told them,\\&quot;On Amazon!\\&quot;   The product came in a very timely manner. It was also in great condition.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the best at doing my own nails, but I enjoy it and have improved over the years.  I spend a lot of cash on my hair so it&#x27;s hard to justify spending $30 (or so) a week on a manicure.  Unfortunately I&#x27;ve spent a fortune on my nails anyway, because I&#x27;m a polish junkie, but that&#x27;s all beside the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the look of the shatter polishes, so despite all of the warnings I decided to give it a go.  Frankly, I probably had the polish for a month before I got up the nerve to do it.  I am equally pleased and displeased with the results, but in applying the polish I think I gained enough knowledge to make a second application go smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here are my notes as a first-time user:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - I was overly cautious of making sure my base color was dry (2 coats of \\&quot;Oro\\&quot; by Nubar from the Liquid Metals collection - looks great under the black shatter!).  I let it dry for an hour or so before applying the shatter.  All tackiness was gone.  Seemed to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - The instructions say to apply a light coat.  I would say apply a normal coat like you would for any other polish.  This stuff is VERY thick and dries VERY VERY fast (reminds me of tar).  If you put too little on the brush it dries too fast and you&#x27;re done. Just put that whole mess out of your head and apply it normal - bearing in mind how thick it is and how fast it dries of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - Because it dries so fast, there&#x27;s little room for error.  If you don&#x27;t like how it went on, you either live with it or start over.  You can&#x27;t take a lot of time trying for an even coat.  It will dry up before you can even rethink what you are doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - NO Retouches!  If you think you didn&#x27;t put enough on in the first pass you have to start over or live with it.  A second pass results in a glob of black mess that doesn&#x27;t crackle.  I&#x27;m going to go through this week resenting my left hand index finger due to this.  humph&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - A high gloss top coat is necessary. Otherwiseit looks like garbage.  I used Nubar Diamonte.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, based on my general ineptitude at anything truly creative, I think it turned out well.  I&#x27;d like to try the silver shatter next, over a black polish like Liquid Leather.  I hope I helped, enjoy!</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish so much! I&#x27;ll intentionally wear it if I&#x27;m going somewhere that I don&#x27;t know a lot of the people because it is a great convo starter. It works exactly as it is supposed to!</li>
    <li> I was amazed at how this changes the look of your polish.  It adds a new dimension to your color.  Just need to use under very bright colors otherwise it darkens the darker ones too much.</li>
    <li> This is a great black shatter that goes on easily and cracks great,definitely recommend this for anyone that likes to have really cool looking nails...</li>
    <li> i received this shipment very promptly. i only had to wait a couple of days to receive it. it came in great condition. the whole transaction was very professional. thank you so much!</li>
    <li> This polish does exactly what it says.  I got home from work, saw my package arrived, ripped it open and put it on.  I applied it over polish I already had on for a few days.  Within seconds it crackled perfectly and was dry in a few minutes!  The first time I used it my nails looked just like the advertisements!!!!!  Totally worth the money, if you are interested in it and like how it looks in the pictures BUY IT you will not be dissapointed!</li>
    <li> This is great, if you don&#x27;t have time to do all types of fancy things to your nails this will do it for you!! It works literally in seconds and it looks great over bright nail polish. All pros no cons, great product!</li>
    <li> Made out of like a rubber substance gave me memories of my very first nail polish as a child . I can peel it off if I don&#x27;t put the clear coat on top. It&#x27;s also matte so the clear coat is a must. Do not wear with dark nail polish as it gives no real affect I bought it with not like the movies (silver) and had to remove it and use it each time with bright neons like lime and hot pink. It&#x27;s nice but not to die for as advertised everywhere I would have kept my $14 and felt better about it.</li>
    <li> The product is awful.  It was thick and wouldn&#x27;t go onto my nails correctly.  I expectly a nice smooth look but what I got was a lumpy bumpy look and I didn&#x27;t put too much on.  I couldn&#x27;t help putting on the abount I did because it came out so lumpy.</li>
    <li> This polish is so cool, gives an awesome look to any color nails. Dries really quickly so paint fast but end result is amazing!</li>
    <li> Am I the only one who thinks the crackle polish phenomenon is a tad overrated? Sure, it&#x27;s a cute twist on a plain manicure... but it honestly just looked like chipped nail polish when you really look at it.     Anyhow, if you want the best results make sure you 1). Let your base color dry. Like, very dry. 2). Apply a very thin coat, and do not go over it more than once.</li>
    <li> As soon as I received this product, I had to try it on. I has a base coat of green and placed the shatter on top. Within seconds, the shatter top coat began to crack, (which btw was very cool looking), and took about a minute to settle down and stop cracking.   When using this product, sure you shake the bottle well because it will dry up and be chunky if the bottle is not shaken well. Overall- LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Here is why its a waste of money :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The nail polish itself is very thick and the results dont look as impressive as the ones you see on the youtube videos for this \\&quot;crackle\\&quot; nail polish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It dries up very quickly that the whole bottle is more of a one time &#x27;use and throw&#x27;. If you are a person to add the plain nail polish to liquefy it, the crackle will no longer work and you will end up with a dull black shade of a thick nail polish</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d read a lot of reviews about this polish being difficult to apply but when I made sure my first two coats of silver nail polish (Sally Hansen 330- Pedal to the Metal) were COMPLETELY DRY and applied ONE coat of black shatter over it, the result was just the same as the description and picture. Loved it, can&#x27;t wait to get more colours :)</li>
    <li> My youngest daughter (college student) wanted this for Christmas.  I got it for her and also for my oldest (mom of 3) and they both LOVE IT!  Easy to apply and looks like a professional manicure when done.</li>
    <li> I tried this nail polish it worked fine but after a couple months the lid got jammed and when i finally opened it is shattered</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Daughter, and she loves it. It looks really nice on top of any color of her choice.   She gets a lot of comments on her nails from people, really is cute.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when i got the package in the mail and tried it with a bright orange nail polish i had and it looks fantastic!, the shatters quickly and dry&#x27;s even quicker :) i recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Okay i am going to be honest. This stuff is pretty cool. But it is very hard to paint on because it is very thick. and then the shatter effect is hard to look even. the black is pretty harsh looking though so i hope OPI comes out with other shatters. I know china glaze has other colors too.</li>
    <li> Works just as it&#x27;s supposed to.. Very happy with product... When I need more I will surely buy again :-)</li>
    <li> Bought this item and got it just a few days later - super fast shipping. Never had tried it before, but I&#x27;ve got a pink base with the black shatter on top and it is FABULOUS! Looks so fun and different. The tips I have read from others proved to be true, you want to apply it quickly as it shatters right after you put it on. Thin layers work best and only one stroke per area - do not duplicate strokes. I definitely want to get this polish in other colors!</li>
    <li> This is a very cool look, and has been outrageously popular lately. The salon at my work was constantly sold out of these bottles, so I ended up ordering it from Amazon. The black looks great with light colors that provide contrast. I recommend putting a clear coat on top to prevent it from chipping off, and it makes the black shinier and a lot prettier. The only problem I had with this was that to get the right look, there had to be a perfect amount of polish on the brush. But this is a problem with most nail polishes. The salon brush covered my nail in one stroke, which I liked. And the shatter design looks different on every nail. It&#x27;s really a great product, and a unique polish. I highly recommend, it&#x27;s very noticeable and you&#x27;ll get tons of compliments!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing as long as you know how to put it on correctly. It might take a few times to practice but once you got it, it will look perfect :) The thicker you put it the larger the cracks will be but if you put it on thin it will have very small cracks. Good product.</li>
    <li> i USE THIS RELIGIOUSLY!! I will do it with bright colors, neutrals, nudes, water marbel etc. I just regret that I didn&#x27;t get more than one bottle!</li>
    <li> it cracks just like the picture shown. I do my own nails and this shatter lacquer makes it look like i got them professional done. I love the look.</li>
    <li> its perfect it actually crackles perfectly :) it looks nice on the nails and it dried supper fast too. i love it !</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by another other brand. If you want quality, buy this. The original &amp;#34;shatter&amp;#34; polish. PLEASE NOTE: the best advice I can give is that for each nail, you have one shot. You cannot apply more than one coat to achieve the desired affect. Make sure there is adequate polish on the brush to cover the entire nail in three strokes. Work quickly,  then watch the magic happen as it dries. Do not attempt to go over wet shatter polish again, it will ruin the entire nail design. Applied smoothly and dried quickly. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s cool but after a while, i get tired of it. also, it doesn&#x27;t come out as well with other colors so i guess it works best with white or silver.</li>
    <li> This polish works good</li>
    <li> Me and my daughter loves this so does my niece ;) we use it with all my reg. nail colors</li>
    <li> Nail tech has gotten me &amp;#34;hooked&amp;#34; on the shatter!  Have ordered several colors so I can &amp;#34;play&amp;#34;.  My eldest granddaughter really likes it and thinks her grandmother is a pretty cool lady!  I will definitely be placing more orders, especially since it arrives so fast and is in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> Love the randomness of black shatter on my nails. Always unique patterns every time.</li>
    <li> Received speedy delivery from this seller which is always a plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I opened the package I tested it out over polich I had on my nails already. As soon as the polished dried it was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a tip on how to get the best results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1 Let you bottom coat dry completly.&lt;br /&gt;#2 Only use a thin coat of the shatter.&lt;br /&gt;#3 Do not over coat the fist layer of Shatter, because it will NOT give you the right effect. (Very Important)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again do not overlay the first coat of shatter!Black shatter in my opinion looks better over very bright polish. Using dark colors will take away form the shatter look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I have about this product, I used my shatter twice and it is already becoming thick. I&#x27;m not sure if this is an issue for everyone but my product is getting thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond that I really like the product.</li>
    <li> Got this for my granddaughter after seeing all the ads in the current fashion magazines.  I had to try it and did.  It&#x27;s a bit strange.  I&#x27;m sure my granddaughter will be delighted, however.</li>
    <li> i love this nail polish its awsome, it makes any ordinary color so much fun def. a great way to have a different look in your nails :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what is in these bottles that I received, but it is not shatter polish. I purchased black and white shatter. Both polished on like white out. The result was not even close to how it was supposed to be. I have had crakle and shatter polish done before, so I know how it should look. I wasted my money on this. I would&#x27;ve been better off going into a retail store to buy it. Can someone tell me what went wrong with this company?? What is in these bottles that I have?? It sure isn&#x27;t shatter polish!!</li>
    <li> lies this product was crap.</li>
    <li> this is a very hip, trendy, application for your nails. I got a lot of compliments on my nails...I used a pale shimmery pink for the base and it looked amazing. Just remember to shake the bottle in between applying color to each nail because it dries up quickly.</li>
    <li> This serves its purpose and it works!  Perfect for halloween</li>
    <li> it was great at first but now it is all chalky and stuck together</li>
    <li> Over a year after buying this, this is still my favorite nail polish! I need more :D</li>
    <li> OOh, I love this crackle.  i put it over glow in the dark polish and it was a hit.  Gotta do it just right or it doesnt come out right.  Thanks to my nail lady all went great.</li>
    <li> This is a cool shatter topcoat. The only draw back is that it gets really clumpy after using it two or three times.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot! Except, the brush fell off of the handle, which makes it hard to put on.</li>
    <li> This black crackle looks great. It seperates perfectly the way it is supposed it. Good price, cheaper to buy on Amazon than to pay for it at the salon. I have many colors for my girls and just do them myself. Buy the Poshe top coat with it!!!!</li>
    <li> Of course crackle polish is a must have! So I bought this one and it works really great, once you get the hang of it. However, the polish in the bottle dries up sooo fast! So all you have to do is add a little bit of acetone, shake up the bottle and it&#x27;s good as new!</li>
    <li> Purchased this years ago and it still works! Gotta love opi! It&#x27;s a little thicker than it should be but I still love it.</li>
    <li> Only used it once so far but didnt turn out well</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this nail polish.  It&#x27;s nearly effortless and looks amazing.  Thin coats will get you very spidery cracks, too thick and it won&#x27;t really crack, a normal amount gets you cracks like in the photo.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom. She really liked it! It went on smoothly dried quickly and cracked amazingly! It cracks matte but with a topcoat it&#x27;s so pretty.The only thing is after a while it got a bit thick I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s because of the climate here in Trinidad and Tobago...but i added a splash of nail polish remover to it and it was good as ever.</li>
    <li> Black crakle nail polish wasn&#x27;t as cool as I thought it would be. I guess it just didn&#x27;t look that good.</li>
    <li> so i may not be the best person to review this to you because i bought the polish to paint my knives but here is my two cents. while i was painting my knives with nail polish i used two brands some cheap polish and opi, i could feel the difference in quality, opi is on another level of smooth and sleek and the shatter feature works flawlessly.</li>
    <li> I first got the Nicole by OPI shatter wish I hadn&#x27;t after I read that this one has the normal OPI brush so gave that one away. Shatters great and no tiny brush to deal with.</li>
    <li> This nail polish is great.  It definitely lives up to the OPI reputation, and it crackles really well.  It also stands up to wear and tear really well, I usually can&#x27;t go more than two days without chipping and this lasted nearly a week.</li>
