      <li>This is a great price for this product!  </li>
      <li>Matrix started this ULTRA line and added SILICONES to an otherwise perfect conditioner and shampoo.</li>
      <li>should the makers ever discontinue the BEST CONDITIONER ON THE PLANET.&lt;br</li>

      <li>Great smell and hair feels clean after.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Seems to leave more body and mositure than the Ultra Hydrating Shampoo.</li>
      <li>I love Biolage and if you buy this size in the hair salon you will spend over $60.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is my favorite.</li>
      <li>Healthy body and shine and everything.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Ive used the originals for over 20 years and have had day dreams winning the lottery and stockpiling this stuff by the gallon in an underground bunker ...</li>
      <li>This is perfect shampoo if you have hair issues like over bleached hair or dry and frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>This is hand down, the best shampoo you can buy.</li>
      <li>My most fave shampoo ever, great for my dry scalp too.</li>
      <li>IT gives luster and makes my hair smooth like never before.</li>
      <li>youve never used these products before, please look up my reviews of the original formula BIOLAGE CONDITIONING BALM.</li>
      <li>My hair and new growth feel amazing.</li>
      <li>If your hair needs some TLC from the dry, winter air, this is a great shampoo.</li>
      <li>and I can have it shipped right to my door!</li>
      <li>Every time I go to my hair stylist she likes to play with my hair because is soft and nice.</li>
      <li>My hair feels clean all day and is very silky smooth, but easy to manage.</li>
      <li>OK, but really dries my hair out.</li>
      <li>Seriously, this is the best shampoo I have ever used in my life.</li>
      <li>I straightened my hair for the first time in almost 2 months after using this and it was easy, not dry or frizzy, and so silky smooth!</li>
      <li>It is really worth its money.</li>
      <li>Now my hair is once again soft and easy to do in the morning.</li>
      <li>The styling mousse is also a great product :) This is definitely worth the price, and I only have to wash my hair every 4 days or so now because it cleanses my hair and scalp and it stay clean without getting buildup and without having to constantly spray things in my hair to tame the curls!</li>
      <li>you want the regular, old, tried and true conditioning balm all you have to do is make sure it doesnt say ULTRA on the label.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair feel so clean and soft.  </li>
      <li>It smells different, and is a subpar product, designed only to give the illusion of more conditioning through more instant &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; right after using.</li>
      <li>I LUV THIS SHAMPOO,EXCELLENT , FAST DELIVERY</li>
      <li>I had originally bought a 33 oz bottle for $15 from a local salon 3 years ago because they talked me into it.</li>
      <li>In particular the ultra hydrating is the type to get.</li>
      <li>I have been on the look out for another bottle but couldn&#x27;t get over the high prices.</li>
      <li>Try it to get it from Amazon and get free shipping or get the other size from Amazon.</li>
      <li>I really notice it when I run out of this and have to go back to the pharmacy brand I have lying around.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair soft and silky.</li>
      <li>no need to stockpile yet, as the old version is still being produced.</li>
      <li>Now my hair looks and feels soft and shiny.  </li>
      <li>And it made my hair really soft and moisturized the scalp like no other.</li>
      <li>Thankfully, the regular conditioning balm and matching shampoo are still alive and well, and unchanged.</li>
      <li>Not sure if it actually made my hair any healthier, but it certainly feels softer!</li>

<li> Eventually those silicones will coat your hair, cause buildup, and dry your hair out and make it crunchy and damaged.</li>
<li> My hair was so damaged and dry before using Biolage Ultra Hydrating shampoo.</li>
<li> It is amazing..esp for the dry curly hair like mine.</li>
<li> The price may be a little steep, but if you can find it on sale, you should definitely try it out.</li>
<li> Everything came as expected.</li>
<li> it just doesn&#x27;t work the way my other shampoos do for me</li>
<li> My hair can get a little dry and frazzled--this moisturizing shampoo fits the bill.</li>
<li> That bottle lasted me a year and a half.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling sticky or heavy at all afterwards.   </li>
<li> Makes my hair soft and silky but it&#x27;s too, too expensive</li>
<li> I have thick corse hair</li>

    <li> very pleased will buy again</li>
    <li> My hair can get a little dry and frazzled--this moisturizing shampoo fits the bill. Makes my hair soft and silky but it&#x27;s too, too expensive and I can have it shipped right to my door!</li>
    <li> This is a great price for this product!  If your hair needs some TLC from the dry, winter air, this is a great shampoo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is my favorite. Great smell and hair feels clean after. Comes packaged well and no leaks.</li>
    <li> Great convenience to get this shipped.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Biolage products for years, but I think they changed the formula or something.  It no longer leaves my hair feeling all that hydrated.</li>
    <li> I LUV THIS SHAMPOO,EXCELLENT , FAST DELIVERY</li>
    <li> I have used this type of shampoo in the past-(purchased at local store).  I bought it online because the store sold out.  It is not the same product even though the bottle looks the same..</li>
    <li> This shampoo works great!  It smells good, and my friends like to use it, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy the \\&quot;big\\&quot; bottle (as advertised here).  It will last you longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Seems to be working..only 1-2 weeks i been using it..noticing alittle difference. I will wait longer and see. Smells good</li>
    <li> This is hand down, the best shampoo you can buy. In particular the ultra hydrating is the type to get. My hair feels clean all day and is very silky smooth, but easy to manage. I really notice it when I run out of this and have to go back to the pharmacy brand I have lying around.</li>
    <li> I had originally bought a 33 oz bottle for $15 from a local salon 3 years ago because they talked me into it. And it made my hair really soft and moisturized the scalp like no other. That bottle lasted me a year and a half. I have been on the look out for another bottle but couldn&#x27;t get over the high prices. Finally decided to get this for $22 shipped. Now my hair is once again soft and easy to do in the morning. Awesome!</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t work for my hair type and consistency  it just doesn&#x27;t work the way my other shampoos do for me</li>
    <li> THIS IS NOT ULTRA HYDRATING SHAMPOO! IT&#x27;S DETANGLING SOLUTION! DON&#x27;T BUY THIS UNLESS THAT&#x27;S WHAT YOU WANT. I&#x27;M RETURNING MINE.</li>
    <li> Why change a great thing? Matrix started this ULTRA line and added SILICONES to an otherwise perfect conditioner and shampoo. It smells different, and is a subpar product, designed only to give the illusion of more conditioning through more instant &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; right after using. Eventually those silicones will coat your hair, cause buildup, and dry your hair out and make it crunchy and damaged. Thankfully, the regular conditioning balm and matching shampoo are still alive and well, and unchanged. Thank GOD. Ive used the originals for over 20 years and have had day dreams winning the lottery and stockpiling this stuff by the gallon in an underground bunker ... so that I never run out should the makers ever discontinue the BEST CONDITIONER ON THE PLANET.&lt;br /&gt;If you want the regular, old, tried and true conditioning balm all you have to do is make sure it doesnt say ULTRA on the label. The two different formulas are packaged deceptively similarly, but this rule will see you through.&lt;br /&gt;And no need to stockpile yet, as the old version is still being produced. This brings me peace.&lt;br /&gt;If youve never used these products before, please look up my reviews of the original formula BIOLAGE CONDITIONING BALM.</li>
    <li> One of the best salon products that doesn&#x27;t kill your wallet. Use it with the Ultra-Hydrating Conditioner or another great conditioner. One is bound to see results. It doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling sticky or heavy at all afterwards.   A hefty size for $21. Try it to get it from Amazon and get free shipping or get the other size from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I have thick corse hair and this is what my hair needs!!!</li>
    <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t need a softener when I use this shampoo. Every time I go to my hair stylist she likes to play with my hair because is soft and nice.I recommended to everybody.</li>
    <li> this product/shampoo did a good job on my hair.  Now my hair looks and feels soft and shiny.  Loved it</li>
    <li> My most fave shampoo ever, great for my dry scalp too. Love!!!</li>
    <li> This is perfect shampoo if you have hair issues like over bleached hair or dry and frizzy hair. Over time these problems will be corrected.</li>
    <li> Everything came as expected.</li>
    <li> It is amazing..esp for the dry curly hair like mine. IT gives luster and makes my hair smooth like never before.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it actually made my hair any healthier, but it certainly feels softer! Plus, the shampoo smells great--just like the stuff they use at salons! The price may be a little steep, but if you can find it on sale, you should definitely try it out.</li>
    <li> OK, but really dries my hair out.</li>
    <li> Great product and this turned out to be a good relaible source</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It makes my hair feel so clean and soft.  It is really worth its money. Must try</li>
    <li> Good Product, no downside, but I like Biolage Hydrating Shampoo more for my hair. Seems to leave more body and mositure than the Ultra Hydrating Shampoo.</li>
    <li> best. shampoo. ever.  Healthy body and shine and everything.</li>
    <li> Seriously, this is the best shampoo I have ever used in my life. My hair was so damaged and dry before using Biolage Ultra Hydrating shampoo. I bought the shampoo without the conditioner because I wanted to see if the shampoo would make a difference, and without the paired conditioning balm it works miracles. My hair and new growth feel amazing. I straightened my hair for the first time in almost 2 months after using this and it was easy, not dry or frizzy, and so silky smooth! I finally bought the conditioning balm and I&#x27;m never going to use another shampoo/conditioner again. The styling mousse is also a great product :) This is definitely worth the price, and I only have to wash my hair every 4 days or so now because it cleanses my hair and scalp and it stay clean without getting buildup and without having to constantly spray things in my hair to tame the curls!</li>
    <li> I love Biolage and if you buy this size in the hair salon you will spend over $60. Great value and a great product. It makes my hair soft and silky.</li>
