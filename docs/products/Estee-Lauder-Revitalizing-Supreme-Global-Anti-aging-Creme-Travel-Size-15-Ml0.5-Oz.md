      <li>I highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s really hydrating and makes my skin smooth.</li>
      <li>This creates an extremely smooth, moist and soft skin surface for makeup application.  </li>
      <li>But it looks very chip.</li>
      <li>I can see my skin glowing more, my tone is more even, fine lines less visible, my freckles are even less apparent.</li>
      <li>I have become a loyal Estée Lauder fan and user of there products because of the Revitalizing Supreme Global and the night serum they provide.</li>
      <li>I usually love all their moisture and treatment creams, but this one had a sort of greasy-waxy texture and did not absorb nearly as well as their other creams.</li>
      <li>My skin feels soft and moist after using it at night with Night Repair.</li>
