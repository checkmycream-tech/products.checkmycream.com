      <li>One of the best drugstore liquid eyeliners I have tried.</li>
      <li>This is awesome eyeliner.</li>
      <li>I will keep searching for the perfect liquid liner.</li>
      <li>Just a great product all around.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hell to get off even with a great makeup remover.</li>
      <li>so figured waterproof had to be a great idea.</li>
      <li>and I saw waterproof and thought that sounded great...</li>
      <li>Great work,</li>
      <li>I thought this was a great eyeliner when I was showering</li>
      <li>Buying this eyeliner was a HUGE mistake !!!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!!  @</li>
      <li>This eyeliner isn&#x27;t that great the packaging seems nice and the tip of it</li>
      <li>effective creamy eye makeup remover lotion works great to remove this.  </li>
      <li>in all, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this unless you&#x27;re an eyeliner expert and appreciate a good challenge.</li>
      <li>it is VERY BOLD!!</li>
      <li>I really LOVE this eyeliner because the color is so great</li>
      <li>It is, by far, the best I&#x27;ve ever tried - easy to put on (brilliant applicator), long-wearing, gorgeous.</li>
      <li>It stays on all day without a smudge and thats what I love about it!</li>
      <li>I have bought better at the dollar tree!  </li>
      <li>I can say I absolutely LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>this is my favorite liner.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;run\\&quot; like most eyeliners do.</li>
      <li>I love this waterproof liquid eye liner.  </li>
      <li>This eyeliner is better than any $10+ eyeliner</li>
      <li>Ok, this liquid waterproof eyeliner is just that.  </li>
      <li>beware if you try, maybe it will work better for you</li>
      <li>(I do a thicker cat eye line-style on top of my eyelids, maybe that is my problem)  </li>
      <li>#1, I put my mascara on 1st, because if you try to put it on after the eyeliner &amp; the eyeliner gets in your lashes, your lashes will clump and you wont be able to get them unstuck.  </li>
      <li>I also love the felt tip liner, I think they give you so much better control than the \\&quot;thin\\&quot; brushes in some liquid liners....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d like to say I was impressed, but I simply wasn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>most eyeliners fade out, but not this one..</li>
      <li>And on top of that, I got some on my fingers and no matter WHAT I use (soap, lotion, etc)</li>
      <li>in all, not a bad eyeliner, just one that needs more maintenance and removal techniques than you might be used to!</li>
      <li>You just wash your face as normal, put some of the lotion eye remover on, rub it in good, use a damp warm cloth &amp; whalla, its all off.....</li>
      <li>ive tried ALL kinds of different waterproof eyeliners, but this one is the best by far (stilla makes a great pen liquid liner too)</li>
      <li>The product is really good for a whole day affair cause it doesnt smudge or fade.</li>
      <li>The eyeliner smears easily</li>
      <li>but I remember my sister told me a easy and affordable way to get eyeliner off.</li>
      <li>(Once its dry..it lives up to the name of being truly waterproof), and that is a huge plus for me..</li>
      <li>but I do use it for making that precise point for a \\&quot;cat</li>
      <li>Gets on smoothly.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly.</li>
      <li>And by that time, the original eyeliner line I had painted on was patchy/spotty from all of the areas where the eyeliner had transferred to my eyelid.  </li>
      <li>I usually buy the non-waterproof one and it works great!</li>
      <li>If you are looking to glue your eyelids in the full upright and locked position, then this is your eyeliner.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s not impossible to get</li>
      <li>Really?!?!</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t believe me look at my picture, it shows exactly what it does for me!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Having said that, it may be worth it just to try out the look.</li>
      <li>take a piece of tissue and it rubs right off.</li>
      <li>if I make an error, to get it right away.</li>
      <li>and it does stay on longer than most, but its not as good as the gosh extreme, shame that gosh re packaged this product changing the formula at the same time</li>
      <li>Oh and if you mess up good luck to you , this is the hardest thing to take off even with make up remover.</li>
      <li>This has many of the attributes of the regular eyeliner--thin brush, goes on easily, comes in a variety of colors, looks as natural as you want or don&#x27;t want!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For me, I know where my points are and it glided on very well!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty upset.</li>
      <li>get their formulation straight!)</li>
      <li>Stays on pretty well.</li>
      <li>i used a liquid liner pen first to practice.</li>
      <li>Also, the tip was hardened when I first opened it -</li>
      <li>I think it may take a steadier hand than mine to make this work consistently.</li>
      <li>First off, they didn&#x27;t lie about it being waterproof..</li>
      <li>After my first use I&#x27;m never using it again.</li>
      <li>Overall, it was ok..</li>
      <li>It has a nice dark line which is what I like.  </li>
      <li>The same stuff I have used with several other waterproof brands (that did NOT smear on my skin) that works perfectly.  </li>
      <li>This went on pretty well, nice control and flow, but once it dried, any pulling of the eyes and it cracks apart(no</li>
      <li>Within an hour, it got to the point where blinking was largely ineffective, because my eyelid muscles would be pulling my eyelids downward, but my eyelids refused to move.  </li>
      <li>I buy this stuff because I haven&#x27;t had an eyeliner pop as much as this do but after about 8hrs of wear the water proof is not so waterproof anymore and it smudges.</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t really see the utility for this eyeliner.</li>
      <li>I have about 5 dampened Qtips ready</li>
      <li>have to check my makeup every 20-30 minutes because if I blink too much I get smudges</li>
      <li>i have really shakey hands, i can&#x27;t control the amount on the wand.</li>
      <li>With my non-waterproof eyeliner, I could simply swipe the area lightly with my pinky and the line would be gone, without removing eyeshadow and exfoliating my eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So as I&#x27;m getting ready</li>
      <li>Overall a satisfactory product, the brush is comfortable to hold and all.</li>
      <li>So if you really want water &amp;#34;H20&amp;#34; approved, BUY THIS.</li>
      <li>really is that much of a hassle.</li>
      <li>It stays on better than any other I have tried.  </li>
      <li>I had a black arc along the top of my lid.  </li>
      <li>I could get a good line 1 or even 2 out of 3 tries, but redoing your makeup every other day is a pain.</li>
      <li>It softened a little as I used it more.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t the most cooperative little felt tip.</li>
      <li>yah, you have to take extra care when putting it on, but once you get the hang of it, it is so WELL WORTH</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal.</li>
      <li>the maybelline water proof one is better when I applied the wet in wild one it got up all over my crease and made a huge mess!</li>
      <li>I love the regular Wet &#x27;n&#x27; Wild liquid eyeliner</li>
      <li>, I gotta really scrub but not rough</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is the first AND LAST time I will use this product.  </li>
      <li>On top of this, it is possibly the hardest, most uncomfortable applicator I&#x27;ve ever encountered.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I also had difficulty with the tip and getting the precise cat eye that I typically do.</li>
      <li>its pretty good, difficult to apply and smudges to upper eyelid after a couple of hours but does stay on!..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been through SEVERAL different brands of eyeliner and this is the only one I&#x27;ve found that I actually enjoy using.</li>
      <li>I agree completely with the reviewer that said this eyeliner is basically gorilla</li>
      <li>My eyeliner journey isn&#x27;t done I&#x27;m still looking for a liner that pops, is affordable, lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t melt, and cat eye professional.</li>
      <li>I am amazed at how bold a black it is...</li>
      <li>it stays BOLD black all day.....</li>
      <li>I have no other words for it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I hate this eyeliner. its glittery and has the worst applicator. it&#x27;s not flexible, its like trying to put eyeliner with a toothpick or something very stiff. yes it is watterproof but you have to scrub at it for a while to get off and it left me eye all red and sore. i don&#x27;t recommend it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. i did NOT purchase this on Amazon, but that doesn&#x27;t change the product.</li>
    <li> This was so horrible I have no other words for it.</li>
    <li> I love the regular Wet &#x27;n&#x27; Wild liquid eyeliner so of course tried the waterproof eyeliner. This has many of the attributes of the regular eyeliner--thin brush, goes on easily, comes in a variety of colors, looks as natural as you want or don&#x27;t want!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this is tough stuff to get off. Soap and water often don&#x27;t do it. You&#x27;ll need an oil based make up remover and even then you may find yourself scrubbing a bit to get the liner off. And with that said, when it gets \\&quot;old\\&quot; it flakes. If you put it on in the morning and don&#x27;t have time to touch it up by the evening you may find gaps in it from the flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, not a bad eyeliner, just one that needs more maintenance and removal techniques than you might be used to!</li>
    <li> This eyeliner stays on until you take it off. It does not smudge AT ALL.  It costs considerably less than other eyeliners that don&#x27;t work as well. I will continue to purchase this.  Great work, Wet-n-Wild!</li>
    <li> This eyeliner isn&#x27;t that great the packaging seems nice and the tip of it I got this eyeliner because I wanted something water proof but the maybelline water proof one is better when I applied the wet in wild one it got up all over my crease and made a huge mess! And was so hard to remove without smudging overall I&#x27;m not impressed most of my eyeliners never do this</li>
    <li> This is possibly the MOST horrible eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1:  The brush looks NOTHING like it is pictured on the outside of the box.  On top of this, it is possibly the hardest, most uncomfortable applicator I&#x27;ve ever encountered.  Pencils aren&#x27;t even this hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2:  I applied my make up this morning at 6 AM, by 7:15 I had a black arc along the top of my lid.  I have never had any other eyeliner do this (both waterproof and regular).  When I went to try to wash it off, I ended up literally scraping it off with a paper towel, I had to do this again at 10 AM.  When I went home for lunch, I decided that I would just try to take it off with eye make up remover.  The same stuff I have used with several other waterproof brands (that did NOT smear on my skin) that works perfectly.  After 10 minutes, a torn contact, and extremely red eyes, I gave up.  It had not moved.  I finally tried slathering my eyelids with night time moisturizer before this would even begin to budge.  It took 3 very thick coats and wiping if off in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first AND LAST time I will use this product.  Please beware.  It&#x27;s terrible.</li>
    <li> ive tried ALL kinds of different waterproof eyeliners, but this one is the best by far (stilla makes a great pen liquid liner too) This eyeliner is better than any $10+ eyeliner you find out there, it does not smudge, it will be on in the morning if u dont take if off... i suggest this stuff to everyone</li>
    <li> This went on pretty well, nice control and flow, but once it dried, any pulling of the eyes and it cracks apart(no flakes)and looks like hell.  When it came time to remove it, the liner stuck in my lashes and had to be scraped and pulled off.  Not comfortable, very difficult to remove.  I have bought better at the dollar tree!  I also thought that once the color dried, it had more of an ashy, charcoal look rather than really black.  I will keep searching for the perfect liquid liner.</li>
    <li> Not only is this eyeliner waterproof, it&#x27;s also soap-proof! It takes me forever to get this stuff off my eyes and it&#x27;s a big pain. I got it because my other eyeliner had just run out and I saw waterproof and thought that sounded great... unfortunately, it&#x27;s just a lot of hassle. If you mess up at all then it will take some hardcore scrubbing to correct your eyeliner and that just left me with a mutilated eyelid. This stuff also sticks to your eyelid, which is extremely uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this unless you&#x27;re an eyeliner expert and appreciate a good challenge.</li>
    <li> thumbs up! only 4 stars because when buying I didn&#x27;t realize it was waterproof</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty upset. I just bought this because it was on sale. I usually buy the non-waterproof one and it works great! But this one is awful. The applicator brush is hard and irritated the eyelid when you try to apply it. It doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly. You have to do several small strokes. Also, it took way too long to dry! Even after five minutes, I blinked and it went ito my upper eyelid. Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this. Buy the cheaper one that isn&#x27;t waterprrof</li>
    <li> I bought item at walmart for $3. I never had an experience with &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; drug store products. I&#x27;m the type that goes for organic makeup. I ran out of my MAC liquid eyeliner which was no waterproof, I wanted something smudge and waterproof so I saw this and wanted to give it a try. I can say I absolutely LOVE IT! If your a beginner at winged cat eye liner, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this. You would have to go over and over redoing it. For me, I know where my points are and it glided on very well! I would recommend Albolene, this stuff works wonders at taking this product off! For those complaining about it how hard it is to take off? Really?!?! It obviously says H2O PROOF!! It stays on all day without a smudge and thats what I love about it! If you don&#x27;t believe me look at my picture, it shows exactly what it does for me!</li>
    <li> Oh my god it&#x27;s so hard to get this thing off! So if you really want water &amp;#34;H20&amp;#34; approved, BUY THIS. I thought I wanted this but it&#x27;s just a little too tough for me, and leaves dark marks, I gotta really scrub but not rough so my skin won&#x27;t tear. It stays though, I&#x27;ll give it that.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is horrible . I usually use the loreal telescopic waterproof eyeliner but sadly it was out of stock. Buying this eyeliner was a HUGE mistake !!! First of all the tip Is way too hard , it tugs on your eyelid. It does not glide on your eyelid it takes a few strokes just to apply a straight line. Oh and if you mess up good luck to you , this is the hardest thing to take off even with make up remover. If you mess up and try to fix it , it will just make a bigger mess. And last but not least it takes forever to dry , I thought mine was dry until I realized it felt like my eyelid was getting stuck . When I went to go check the eyeliner had smeared onto my eyelid close to my brow bone and I couldn&#x27;t wipe it off. This product is by far the worse eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used. Save your money and time and stay away from this product.</li>
    <li> One of the best drugstore liquid eyeliners I have tried. The only thing that annoys me is taking this off. Once you put it on it&#x27;ll last for hours, even if you were to be in the pool - it would still stay (I would know, I&#x27;ve done this). When you go to take it off, you&#x27;ll have problems unless you use olive oil around the eye.</li>
    <li> Ok, this liquid waterproof eyeliner is just that.  it stays on and doesn&#x27;t even come off with makeup remover.  I&#x27;ve used pencil eyeliner all of my life and decided to try this one, even though my pencil eyeliner stays on all day.  I had a REALLY HARD TIME taking it off.  The skin around my eyes were so red and irritated.  This is just my experience.  other people might not have the same reaction.  I always read reviews before ordering.  I believe they help a lot.</li>
    <li> I love this waterproof liquid eye liner.  It holds extremely well even when I play in the water all day or spend a day outside in the rain.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite liner.  It stays on better than any other I have tried.  Possibly not the easiest to apply, but then I do not find any of them to be easy.&lt;br /&gt;When ever I try a different liner I always end up coming back to this one.</li>
    <li> This stuff is crap. I don&#x27;t even know where to begin. It is not waterproof. It smudges. The formula is too watery. The liner transfers to your eyelid if you have hooded eyes. I used eyelid primer and stay matte powder and it still transferred. The applicator is hard and doesn&#x27;t apply the product well. After just a couple of hours I look like a raccoon. If I could find my receipt I would have taken this junk back. It&#x27;s not worth a penny. I wouldn&#x27;t give this mess to my worst enemy. Do not purchase this! Buy something else. Anything else!</li>
    <li> First off, they didn&#x27;t lie about it being waterproof.. They just don&#x27;t tell you it&#x27;s also soap proof.. And it&#x27;ll glue your eyelid and make your lashes clumpy. I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon but I came here to read reviews to see if it was just me.. Apparently it&#x27;s not. I used to use the regular formula but after running out I bought the waterproof one.. I mean, why not? My eyes water a lot and sometimes it smudges my cat eye so figured waterproof had to be a great idea. WRONG. It&#x27;s hell to get off even with a great makeup remover. Mistakes are near impossible to remove.. It&#x27;s very hard to get a straight line, I have to go over it 10 times.. And if you put it on too thick then yes it does flake and takes forever to dry so it ends up smudging.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through SEVERAL different brands of eyeliner and this is the only one I&#x27;ve found that I actually enjoy using. Just a great product all around.</li>
    <li> I should have bought it regular - for practicing waterproof is too hard to get off. Also, the tip was hardened when I first opened it - I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal. It softened a little as I used it more. Overall a satisfactory product, the brush is comfortable to hold and all.</li>
    <li> I got this eyeliner because it&#x27;s waterproof and somewhat cheaper than other liquid liners. After my first use I&#x27;m never using it again. The eyeliner smears easily and it&#x27;s hard to fix/wipe off. After it dried it just felt sticky and unpleasant. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re going somewhere where your face is going to get blasted with water, take comfort in knowing that this eyeliner will be there at the end of the day. It&#x27;s reliably waterproof. Which also means it&#x27;s a pain to take off -- you&#x27;ll be scrubbing for a while. If you leave it on too long, it flakes horribly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had difficulty with the tip and getting the precise cat eye that I typically do. It wasn&#x27;t the most cooperative little felt tip. I ended up wearing this once to a theme park and never touched it after that -- it didn&#x27;t blow my mind enough to be worth the trouble.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this on my waterline or on my lash line but I do use it for making that precise point for a \\&quot;cat eye\\&quot; look and it works wonders at doing so!</li>
    <li> Would not buy again....hated it... Its definitely not waterproof and it smears.........</li>
    <li> I thought this was a great eyeliner when I was showering and it stayed on BUT today I put it on and I noticed my eyelid keeps sticking to my upper eyelid and now my eye is SO SORE.  The eyeliner is extremely sticky and YES like a glue and I feel like my eye is being tortured!! And on top of that, I got some on my fingers and no matter WHAT I use (soap, lotion, etc) it won&#x27;t come off!!!  Also I had to SCRUB at my upper eyelid with a paper towel (ouch) just to get some tiny specks off!! Now I&#x27;m NOT looking forward to trying to get it off my eyelids!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do NOT recommend this product -- beware if you try, maybe it will work better for you (I do a thicker cat eye line-style on top of my eyelids, maybe that is my problem)  anyway this DID NOT work for me so I am going to go back to using Rimmel</li>
    <li> at first i was exeptionaly pleased with this eyeliner, but after a couple of hours wearing it, the black transfares onto the upper eyelid making black marks....the good thing is that it doesnt peel off or flake off, the brush is not easy to use, its too hard and makes drawing clear lines difficult, the good thing about it is the depth of black and it does stay on longer than most, but its not as good as the gosh extreme, shame that gosh re packaged this product changing the formula at the same time, i wish someobdy could make the perfect eyeliner.....anyway....its pretty good, difficult to apply and smudges to upper eyelid after a couple of hours but does stay on!..</li>
    <li> I agree completely with the reviewer that said this eyeliner is basically gorilla glue.&lt;br /&gt;It is. I draw a medium-sized cat eye on everyday and this stuff is horrid.&lt;br /&gt;For one thing, I don&#x27;t understand how it manages to be so hard to take off in the evening&lt;br /&gt;(even with cleansing oil!) when, at the same time, is sliding all over my eyelids all day!&lt;br /&gt;I have to check my makeup every 20-30 minutes because if I blink too much I get smudges&lt;br /&gt;all in the crease of my lid. (thankfully I have oily eyelids so it&#x27;s not impossible to get off)&lt;br /&gt;It really is that much of a hassle. I have used Almay&#x27;s liquid liner for years now but wanted&lt;br /&gt;to make a cruelty-free change (props to Wet n&#x27; Wild for being cruelty-free, but they need&lt;br /&gt;to get their formulation straight!) Obviously, Wet n&#x27; Wild is not the brand for me. Will try&lt;br /&gt;e.l.f next. /:</li>
    <li> This is awesome eyeliner. Stays on pretty well. Gets on smoothly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to say I was impressed, but I simply wasn&#x27;t. I think it may take a steadier hand than mine to make this work consistently. I could get a good line 1 or even 2 out of 3 tries, but redoing your makeup every other day is a pain. Worse, it just doesn&#x27;t stay on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, it may be worth it just to try out the look. For a long-term eyeliner gig, go with Stila&#x27;s waterproof liner. It is, by far, the best I&#x27;ve ever tried - easy to put on (brilliant applicator), long-wearing, gorgeous.</li>
    <li> If you are looking to glue your eyelids in the full upright and locked position, then this is your eyeliner.  I admit that I apply a fairly thick line of eyeliner (not Etta James style or anything, but more than a pencil-thin line), and with my current eyeliner, I usually develop a thin line in the creases of my eyelids over the course of the day from regular blinking-induced transfer.  I thought that a waterproof eyeliner might help keep the line firmly in place and reduce transfer.  Boy, was I wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this eyeliner and let it dry on my lids for a few seconds before going about my day.  Partway through the morning, I noticed that my eyelids felt like they were sticking open slightly.  Within an hour, it got to the point where blinking was largely ineffective, because my eyelid muscles would be pulling my eyelids downward, but my eyelids refused to move.  Think of the eyelids-forced-open scene in A Clockwork Orange, and take it down a notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to the bathroom and discovered that not only had the eyeliner transferred onto my eyelid creases like my old/current eyeliner, but that its &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; properties meant that it was nearly impossible to remove from my eyelid creases as well.  I had to scrub at my eyelids with a paper towel to remove the crease line.  With my non-waterproof eyeliner, I could simply swipe the area lightly with my pinky and the line would be gone, without removing eyeshadow and exfoliating my eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even worse, when I went back to my desk and continued working, I felt the sticky eyes-wide-open process starting all over again, and had to return to the bathroom again later in the day to repeat the scratchy-paper-towel-eyelid-exfoliating-process.  And by that time, the original eyeliner line I had painted on was patchy/spotty from all of the areas where the eyeliner had transferred to my eyelid.  Grr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister, on the other hand, loves this eyeliner.  She applies a pencil-thin line, because that works for her aesthetically, so she has never experienced the eyelid-transfer problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I&#x27;m going to stick with my current eyeliner.  Since I only apply eyeliner to my upper lid and I generally don&#x27;t find myself crying while hanging upside down, I don&#x27;t really see the utility for this eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I am a beginner at using liquid liners when i bought this.. it was so pigmented and i like that.. My problem was, since i&#x27;m a beginner at that plus i have really shakey hands, i can&#x27;t control the amount on the wand. If i wipe the excess, i tend to have not enough on the wand while i&#x27;m applying it. and the liquid liner tends to collect and drip on the tip.. And the liner goes to my eyelashes which makes the lashes stick together and clump. What i did is i used a liquid liner pen first to practice. Now that i&#x27;m getting used to applying liquid liner and it&#x27;s a little easier to control the amount. But i have to admit i still fail sometimes. The product is really good for a whole day affair cause it doesnt smudge or fade. Overall, it was ok..</li>
    <li> I buy this stuff because I haven&#x27;t had an eyeliner pop as much as this do but after about 8hrs of wear the water proof is not so waterproof anymore and it smudges. I will admit this stuff is also a hassle to get of but I remember my sister told me a easy and affordable way to get eyeliner off. Vaseline...I rub it on my eyelid take a piece of tissue and it rubs right off. My eyeliner journey isn&#x27;t done I&#x27;m still looking for a liner that pops, is affordable, lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t melt, and cat eye professional. This eyeliner does 3 out of 4.</li>
    <li> Some reviewers complained about how hard it was to take off.  Of course it is, it&#x27;s waterproof!  What did you expect?  I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t smudge off during the day.  I do have to be careful in putting it on, because it stays where you put it.  It has a nice dark line which is what I like.  I also like that it doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!  @ 1st you have to get used to working with it because if you make an error, it is very hard to get off....just like it says it is WATERPROOF.  I&#x27;ve learned a few tricks that help....#1, I put my mascara on 1st, because if you try to put it on after the eyeliner &amp; the eyeliner gets in your lashes, your lashes will clump and you wont be able to get them unstuck.  So as I&#x27;m getting ready I put several coats of Mascara on. #2 I have about 5 dampened Qtips ready if I make an error, to get it right away. #3, If I get any on my lashes that looks clumpy, I immeditaly get it with the dampened Qtips.  #4...I have found that the AVON Moisture effective creamy eye makeup remover lotion works great to remove this.  You just wash your face as normal, put some of the lotion eye remover on, rub it in good, use a damp warm cloth &amp; whalla, its all off.....I&#x27;ve even found that if I make a big error while applying and the above steps don&#x27;t work, I put a little bit of the Avon lotion eye makeup remover on the Qtip, &amp; use it for like the under eye area or whatever &amp; that does the job.  I really LOVE this eyeliner because the color is so great a black....it is VERY BOLD!! I also love the felt tip liner, I think they give you so much better control than the \\&quot;thin\\&quot; brushes in some liquid liners.... When it says ULTRA BLACK, it means ULTRA BLACK.  I am amazed at how bold a black it is...most eyeliners fade out, but not this one..it stays BOLD black all day.....It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;run\\&quot; like most eyeliners do. (Once its dry..it lives up to the name of being truly waterproof), and that is a huge plus for me..yah, you have to take extra care when putting it on, but once you get the hang of it, it is so WELL WORTH THE EFFORT for an all day and bold look!!!!!</li>
