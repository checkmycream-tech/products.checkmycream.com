      <li>I really enjoy vanilla scented perfumes, and I have previously purchased a couple of Pacifica products before (lemon perfume rollerball, and rose rollerball) and liked those.  </li>
      <li>and now i want their whole collection :)</li>
      <li>and not too sweet.</li>

      <li>Overall, I am pleased with the purchase for the price of $18.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too powerful of a scent either, which you don&#x27;t really want on your lips.</li>
      <li>After receiving the package first thing i noticed was that there was lotion everywhere.</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;ve tried Pacifica&#x27;s French Lilac set and have had no problems with the lotion in that one...and the scent is a light and pretty floral</li>
      <li>Nice little set for travel</li>
      <li>I want to thank all the people who took the time to write a review because your reviews really help me make a choice.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a creamy lotion that really moisturizes without any petroleum products.</li>
      <li>Tested it out in whole foods before i bought it online</li>
      <li>It is very creamy and adds sheen to your lips.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d normally buy the large lotion</li>
      <li>I particularly like island vanilla.</li>
      <li>I have been using the vanilla lotions for awhile now and really like that it is all natural.</li>
      <li>, I naturally wanted to try it.  </li>
      <li>I do have sensitive skin, but no other scented lotions have ever given me a rash.  </li>
      <li>The roll-on perfume is nice and convenient and I do like the Lip Quench (like a large lip balm, slightly vanilla-scented but with a very subtle almost pearlized look).  </li>
      <li>the item was still curious if this was a product I really wanted to buy because of course</li>
      <li>Old product that had no scent left.</li>
      <li>Once I finally got some perfume to come out, the &amp;#34;vanilla&amp;#34; was barely detectable at all.  </li>
      <li>It also does not last beyond the first few seconds of putting it on.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This set was a great price...so since I was buying online, I took a risk that the vanilla scent would be something I would like.  The Island Vanilla scent is just okay.  Not the best vanilla scent I&#x27;ve smelled, but fairly pleasant.  The roll-on perfume is nice and convenient and I do like the Lip Quench (like a large lip balm, slightly vanilla-scented but with a very subtle almost pearlized look).  The only part of it that I didn&#x27;t like was the lotion.  After a couple of days use, the lotion actually gave me a rash where I had put it on my arms, so I quit using it.  I do have sensitive skin, but no other scented lotions have ever given me a rash.  And I&#x27;ve tried Pacifica&#x27;s French Lilac set and have had no problems with the lotion in that one...and the scent is a light and pretty floral I like quite a bit.  So, sorry to say, Island Vanilla only gets 3 stars from me, for just okay.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy vanilla scented perfumes, and I have previously purchased a couple of Pacifica products before (lemon perfume rollerball, and rose rollerball) and liked those.  So when I noticed Pacifica had a vanilla scent, I naturally wanted to try it.  I was very disappointed with everything in this set.  I&#x27;m not sure if I got one that had been sitting on a shelf for two or three years or what, but the rollerball would not even work initially.  Once I finally got some perfume to come out, the &amp;#34;vanilla&amp;#34; was barely detectable at all.  I practically took a bath in it and could not smell it whatsoever!  The body lotion was the same way...scentless.  As for the lip gloss, no vanilla flavor, smell, nothing!  The purchase was a complete waste of money.  If you like vanilla, I would suggest LaVanilla vanilla rollerball.  It smells amazing.</li>
    <li> I love this set.  The scent is so great and I love the lip balm that comes in it.  It is very creamy and adds sheen to your lips.  This is a definite must kit!</li>
    <li> Love the perfume and lip gloss I&#x27;m giving this a four because the lotion has a weird after smell.</li>
    <li> The lip balm&#x27;s taste is awful. I liked the other two products better. This was an expensive one. I think you can buy bigger size with better value for money.</li>
    <li> Love Pacifica!! Their scents are all awesome! I particularly like island vanilla. The scent does not fade quickly at all. I don&#x27;t use the Chapstick often but it doesn&#x27;t leave a weird residue. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This smells so wonderful! I love Pacifica in general and this is my absolute favorite scent. I&#x27;d normally buy the large lotion but I&#x27;m about to go on a trip and this size is perfect for taking on a plane. I&#x27;ll be buying more of these sets at Christmas for gifts, too.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Love Pacifica products and this scent is positively yummy!</li>
    <li> Old product that had no scent left. I usually love this perfume.</li>
    <li> Love this scent!! A little goes a long way!!</li>
    <li> Love Island Vanilla.  Uplifts my spirits.</li>
    <li> Best vanilla sent ever!</li>
    <li> Love the scent, especially for the summer!</li>
    <li> Smells great ! I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> After receiving the package first thing i noticed was that there was lotion everywhere. it was not sealed. so i had to throw it. The roll on perfume was ok. smells nice but doesn&#x27;t stay for too long. i would not repurchase</li>
    <li> The lotion and roll-on perfume is a nice vanilla scent not too powerful. and not too sweet. Absolutely love the lip balm.</li>
    <li> I love pacifica and this set was perfect!!  Tested it out in whole foods before i bought it online and now i want their whole collection :)</li>
    <li> I have been using the vanilla lotions for awhile now and really like that it is all natural. It&#x27;s a creamy lotion that really moisturizes without any petroleum products. The scent is very nice and lasts without being overpowering. I was running low and decided to order this gift set as I think roll-on perfume is fun and reminds me of my childhood in the late 70s. The perfume smells nice, but not as good as the lotion. It also does not last beyond the first few seconds of putting it on. The lip gloss is lovely. It doesn&#x27;t have that sticky feeling of so many glosses. It&#x27;s not too powerful of a scent either, which you don&#x27;t really want on your lips. Overall, I am pleased with the purchase for the price of $18. My daughter enjoys the perfume as a child. I&#x27;m fine with the lotion and gloss.</li>
    <li> Nice little set for travel</li>
    <li> Ok! So I read all the reviews before I purchase the item was still curious if this was a product I really wanted to buy because of course I could not smell the product through the computer. But reading the reviews I decided to take a leap of faith and boy I&#x27;m happy I did because this perfume package I ordered smells delicious and fruity and I&#x27;m in love with the smell. I want to thank all the people who took the time to write a review because your reviews really help me make a choice. Again, I&#x27;m in love with myself and the way I smell which is totally delicious! P.S. The smell is like buying a Big Lollypop at Disneyland with all the colors and flavors of various fruity candy your mind can only imagine. Enjoy and don&#x27;t forget to Smile!</li>
    <li> Delightful! Holds its scent over hours, yet not stickey- good clean products.</li>
    <li> I appreciate that this company does not use harmful chemicals, but I wish the scent would stick around a little longer. I love all three products though and would order this product (or another scent) again.</li>
