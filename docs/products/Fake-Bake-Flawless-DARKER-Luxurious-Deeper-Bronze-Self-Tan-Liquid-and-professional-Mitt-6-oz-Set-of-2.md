      <li>Best stuff so far</li>
      <li>Better then a spray tan..</li>
      <li>It is helpful that this self tanner shows up as soon as you apply it so you can cover all areas appropriately and avoid creating streaks.</li>

      <li>Fast drying, very even color, and most natural dark color tan.</li>
      <li>when you first put it on is helpful and after washing it off the next morning</li>
      <li>It fades after about 5 days, but I much prefer to apply every 5-7 days rather than use a daily self tanner that makes me feel sticky and smelly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s looks natural.</li>
      <li>My skin was also soft.</li>
      <li>The only negative thing, which is not a biggy, is when you apply it on your back, and your hair is wet, it will leave water streaks, which is only the color they added to better control where you are rubbing it in at, so be sure to just wipe it away.  </li>
      <li>As with the regular Fake Bake, this goes on smoothly, and the color is soooooooooooooooo natural and streakfree, not to mention, tans quickly.  </li>

<li> Not sure if the seller or the product is questionable, but definitely will not be purchasing again.</li>
<li> The only bad thing I did not like is when it fades it gets a little splotchy.</li>
<li> one bottle usually lasts me a month!</li>
<li> This product was horrible.</li>

    <li> Washed off as soon as I showered</li>
    <li> Best Self Sunless Tanner ever and I&#x27;ve spent so much money on St. TROPEZ , TANTOWEL,  BEAUTISOL, AND THIS IS THE BEST IT TAKES AN EXTRA 3 MINUTES AFTER SHOWERING THEN BLOWDRY FOR 3 MINUTES AND PUT ON MOUSTUISER AND ALWAYS WEAR GLOVES AND USE THE MITT.IT JUST TAKES EFFORT AND CONSISTENCY AND YOU&#x27;LL LOOK HOT</li>
    <li> Use this every summer.</li>
    <li> Better then a spray tan.. no wait, color appears when you apply.</li>
    <li> Works great. Love this product. No orange or streaking.</li>
    <li> Best self tanner I have ever used. The color guard when you first put it on is helpful and after washing it off the next morning, I am a nice tan for a few days. It&#x27;s looks natural.</li>
    <li> Best self tanner I have found.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  the color guard is a great shade so even if you forget to use it in advance, you&#x27;ll still have a great tan if you just applied this product!  For the best results reember to exfoliate first.</li>
    <li> This product was horrible. I used the regular fake bake all summer last year. I was hoping this one would be better and darker. The color doesn&#x27;t last and I had to reapply it at least 3 times a week when you&#x27;re only supposed to do it once. I did everything I was supposed to and it still didn&#x27;t work. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. I&#x27;ll stick to my loreal self tanner.</li>
    <li> I have fair to medium skin and I enjoy having a nice summer glow without running the risk of skin cancer in tanning beds. I have used several self tanners over the years and this has become my new favorite. I apply after exfoliating in the shower. I spray several sprays on the mitt provided and apply in circular motions to my entire body. It is helpful that this self tanner shows up as soon as you apply it so you can cover all areas appropriately and avoid creating streaks. The scent reminds me of a tropical/coconut smell and it is the most pleasant self tanner scent out of all the ones I have used (It doesn&#x27;t give me a headache like others have in the past). It feels so light on my skin and dries within minutes. It does seem to make my skin a little dry, I recommend applying a moisturizing lotion after you shower the next day. The color fades a bit after the first shower you take, but you can apply again to reach your desired level of darkness. It fades after about 5 days, but I much prefer to apply every 5-7 days rather than use a daily self tanner that makes me feel sticky and smelly. I have gotten many compliments on how natural the tan looks. I love this product and I recommended it to all of my friends, family, and co-workers.</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;ve been an avid fan of FBF for a year now, I wanted to up my self tanning game so I ordered Fake Bake Flawless Darker. Not only was it NOT darker, but it didn&#x27;t even make me AS dark as the milder formula. I tried to contact the seller and got no response. Not sure if the seller or the product is questionable, but definitely will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Love love love love this product!!! Always keeps me nice and tan, apply about 2-3 times a week one bottle usually lasts me a month! Loved that I could order two at once.</li>
    <li> Awesome colour. Very dark. Good smell and real tan looking. My skin was also soft. Love this product!</li>
    <li> Turned me a strange red color. Not pleased. I gave it to a friend and she had the same experience.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and beautiful color!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! Once you use this, you will never go back to anything else. Smells like coconut and vanilla. Fast drying, very even color, and most natural dark color tan. Does not look orange at all. I&#x27;ve been a repeat customer for the original Fake Bake Flawless self tanner and now for the Fake Bake Flawless Darker.</li>
    <li> not what i expected...very drying to my skin</li>
    <li> i have tried several self tanning products and this one has worked the best. There is no streaking and the color does not have a yellowish tint. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Love fake bake flawless. Thank you for specify delivery</li>
    <li> There is only one word I can use to explain how I like this ................. AWESOME!  As with the regular Fake Bake, this goes on smoothly, and the color is soooooooooooooooo natural and streakfree, not to mention, tans quickly.  The only negative thing, which is not a biggy, is when you apply it on your back, and your hair is wet, it will leave water streaks, which is only the color they added to better control where you are rubbing it in at, so be sure to just wipe it away.  It&#x27;s truly worth it&#x27;s money, and what I also use, is the Fake Bake Lotion since the spray doesn&#x27;t moisturize, and to keep the color fresh in between sprays.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the color. It last about a week which is perfect for me, the smell is great. The only bad thing I did not like is when it fades it gets a little splotchy.</li>
    <li> Best stuff so far and I have tried alot it washes off fast and u need to reapply that why I have giving 4 starts</li>
