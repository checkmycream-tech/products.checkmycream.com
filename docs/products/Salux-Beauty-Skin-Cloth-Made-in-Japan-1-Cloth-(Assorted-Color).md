      <li>AMAZING PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be recommended for those with really sensitive skin, but to those with some &amp;#34;tougher&amp;#34; skin this is a great cleansing cloth!</li>
      <li>As cheap as they are on Amazon, try one!</li>
      <li>Use daily for best results.</li>
      <li>The Salux brand is rougher (and I think better) than the imitations I have since seen.</li>

      <li>I used to use poufs in the shower, better exfoliation I thought.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love my salux cloth.</li>
      <li>Can be folded with the soap tucked on the inside to more of a washcloth size.  </li>
      <li>This is pretty good, it exfoliates and is very cheap.</li>
      <li>What impressed me is that regular washcloths are prone to becoming germ havens, but this cloth does not hold bacteria like cotton wash cloths.</li>
      <li>Loved this so much that I purchased a pack of 3 more.  </li>
      <li>(JUST BE SURE THAT YOURS-RECEIVED IS A GENUINE &amp;#34;SALUX&amp;#34;</li>

      <li>Obviously I loved it enough to buy my own, and tossed all the poufs</li>
      <li>Very nice and long which makes it perfect to use on your back.  </li>

      <li>Really nice for whole body and esp.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth it for the cost savings alone!</li>
      <li>I am a first time user and fell in love with this cloth, my partner did too.</li>
      <li>washcloth to help you clean easier.  </li>
      <li>Rinses clean after every use.</li>
      <li>but once you get used to the rough feel of it, you will be happy.</li>
      <li>I love it so much that I bought one for every woman in my family.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve recommended them to many others over the years because they are easier than a back brush, more vigorous than a wash cloth, and quick-drying.</li>
      <li>Makes super lather from your bar or liquid soap.  </li>
      <li>You will need to use a different item to clean more tender areas if you get my meaning.  </li>
      <li>The material rinses clean and dries fast, and does not hold smells or bacteria.  </li>
      <li>It is great for your skin and detoxification, feels nice, has a good amount of exfoliation without being painful, even on my partner&#x27;s super sensitive skin, and after using it we feel like we&#x27;ve reached a whole new level of clean.</li>
      <li>Arrived very fast.</li>
      <li>I first found these while living in Japan.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s where I first used the Salux skin cloth.</li>
      <li>Long enough to wash your back, will wad up something like a pouf, but the texture is perfect!</li>
      <li>This really works and leaves my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my legs super soft and ready for sunless tanning lotion.</li>
      <li>My skin is so much softer and healthier looking now.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much soap to make a lot of lather).</li>
      <li>I got the real thing.</li>
      <li>My skin is as soft and smooth as a child&#x27;s skin and I am 41 years old.</li>
      <li>only is it a fantabulous and thorough exfoliator, it also rinses clean, air dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t gather mildew, and lasts far longer than a pouf -by</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of harsh</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this myself as well, and have notied the ease with which I can clean my back with it.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend if you want a &amp;#34;slightly rough&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Order directly from Japan if you want the real thing.</li>
      <li>They dry quickly with a blow dryer, ready to go back into the suitcase in a jiffy.</li>
      <li>Will certainly be a repeat customer in the future!</li>
      <li>PRODUCT, MANUFACTURED IN JAPAN [NOT in China], or its quality WILL NO-WHERE NEARLY MATCH</li>
      <li>I have been using these since sometime in the early 1990s.</li>
      <li>now, at least three poufs would have been sacrificed, forcing me to buy more.</li>
      <li>This &amp;#34;recycling&amp;#34; act extends their VERY useful life-span ANOTHER few</li>
      <li>At first they feel rather rough but they polish and exfoliate your skin like nothing else.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s tricky with first use - feels too rough</li>
      <li>SEND IT BACK IMMEDIATELY, UNOPENED, FOR A REFUND!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW OF THE ORIGINAL, &amp;#34;SALUX&amp;#34; JAPANESE-MADE CLOTH:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WATCH OUT DIRT AND BODY-GREASE...HERE IT COMES!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an almost-all synthetic, long washcloth with a REAL &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; propensity to &amp;#34;sloth&amp;#34; away dead skin, dirt and body oils that leave you feeling &amp;#34;invigorated&amp;#34; after every shower or bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After reading other reviews on this product in other listings in this price range, I was worried I would end up with a cheap knock-off after ordering this -</li>
      <li>Definitely helped clear up some body problems.</li>

<li> After reading other reviews on this product in other listings in this price range, I was worried I would end up with a cheap knock-off after ordering this -</li>
<li> Definitely helped clear up some body problems.</li>
<li> Thick and just the right amount of scrubbing.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used ones that were cheaper and they&#x27;re so thin you don&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
<li> I just pop mine in the washer and they last a very long time.      </li>
<li> I got this for my wife because she wanted a washcloth that was slightly &amp;#34;scratchy&amp;#34; rather than soft, because the scratchyness helps remove dirt easier and exfoliate.  </li>
<li> When my husband got one as a gift, I was curious enough to try it.</li>
<li> Wash and dry in dryer monthly</li>
<li> It&#x27;s also a little big</li>
<li> This is a secret to soft skin!!!</li>
<li> My husband loves these, he has used these for 50 years and wouldn&#x27;t use any other.  </li>
<li> (especially if you&#x27;re really dirty and don&#x27;t have sensitive skin!!)</li>
<li> You will wonder why you&#x27;ve ever used a cloth to wash your body (not ideal for the face with sensitive skin).  </li>
<li> /&gt;They produce copious amounts of foam from small amounts of almost any body-wash liquid or bar soaps and the cloths, themselves, last me at least a couple of years before they must be replaced (always, because a couple of inches of their ends begin to tear off after that amount of time/usage, during the type of back-scrub motions as exhibited on the package&#x27;s front side)</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t think of leaving on a trip without a few in the suitcase.</li>
<li> It helps remove dead skin immediately.</li>
<li> usually fully-dries in less then</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a decent enough exfoliating cloth, but it came out of the package with a terrible smell.</li>
<li> I did notice that I have to use gentler soaps with this when it got cold.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> After reading other reviews on this product in other listings in this price range, I was worried I would end up with a cheap knock-off after ordering this - but nope. I got the real thing. I am a first time user and fell in love with this cloth, my partner did too. It is great for your skin and detoxification, feels nice, has a good amount of exfoliation without being painful, even on my partner&#x27;s super sensitive skin, and after using it we feel like we&#x27;ve reached a whole new level of clean. It even makes soap last longer than it did before we had this (it gets super lathery, make sure you soap it up well before using. It doesn&#x27;t take much soap to make a lot of lather). Would definitely buy again, probably giving these to family as gifts in the future.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s where I first used the Salux skin cloth. At first they feel rather rough but they polish and exfoliate your skin like nothing else. What impressed me is that regular washcloths are prone to becoming germ havens, but this cloth does not hold bacteria like cotton wash cloths. I just pop mine in the washer and they last a very long time.      I wouldn&#x27;t think of leaving on a trip without a few in the suitcase. They dry quickly with a blow dryer, ready to go back into the suitcase in a jiffy. Further, who knows where the washcloths in a hotel room have been prior to your use? &#x27;Nuff said.</li>
    <li> This product cleans the skin thoroughly while exfoliating. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be recommended for those with really sensitive skin, but to those with some &amp;#34;tougher&amp;#34; skin this is a great cleansing cloth! Just lather up your soap in it and it&#x27;s basically a better version of a loofah!</li>
    <li> I have been using these since sometime in the early 1990s. Before the web made them easier to find, we used to ask family friends visiting Hawaii to pick them up for us. I&#x27;ve recommended them to many others over the years because they are easier than a back brush, more vigorous than a wash cloth, and quick-drying. The Salux brand is rougher (and I think better) than the imitations I have since seen.</li>
    <li> Long enough to wash your back, will wad up something like a pouf, but the texture is perfect! You will wonder why you&#x27;ve ever used a cloth to wash your body (not ideal for the face with sensitive skin).  Makes super lather from your bar or liquid soap.  Rinses clean after every use. It will spoil you! Lasts for years with daily use.</li>
    <li> AMAZING PRODUCT. It helps remove dead skin immediately. I have turned ten or so of my friends onto this product.</li>
    <li> I used to use poufs in the shower, better exfoliation I thought. When my husband got one as a gift, I was curious enough to try it. Obviously I loved it enough to buy my own, and tossed all the poufs I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is it a fantabulous and thorough exfoliator, it also rinses clean, air dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t gather mildew, and lasts far longer than a pouf -by now, at least three poufs would have been sacrificed, forcing me to buy more. It&#x27;s worth it for the cost savings alone!</li>
    <li> This was a pleasant surprise !  Works better then any scrub or bath gel I&#x27;ve ever used !  This really works and leaves my skin soft and smooth.  It&#x27;s tricky with first use - feels too rough but once you get used to the rough feel of it, you will be happy. Keeps my legs super soft and ready for sunless tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> I first found these while living in Japan. They are my beauty secret for smooth polished skin</li>
    <li> My husband loves these, he has used these for 50 years and wouldn&#x27;t use any other.  We keep a good supply on hand. Those at your local stores are NO comparison to Salux Cloth.  Thank you for the prompt order.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent enough exfoliating cloth, but it came out of the package with a terrible smell. I&#x27;ve washed it five times and I still can&#x27;t shake the smell. Hopefully it will fade.</li>
    <li> This is a secret to soft skin!!! Use daily for best results. Change out every 4 months. Wash and dry in dryer monthly</li>
    <li> Great bathing cloth. Order directly from Japan if you want the real thing.</li>
    <li> My skin is so much softer and healthier looking now.  My razor burn is gone.  I did notice that I have to use gentler soaps with this when it got cold.</li>
    <li> Arrived very fast. Love it.</li>
    <li> Loved this so much that I purchased a pack of 3 more.  I got this for my wife because she wanted a washcloth that was slightly &amp;#34;scratchy&amp;#34; rather than soft, because the scratchyness helps remove dirt easier and exfoliate.  I&#x27;ve used this myself as well, and have notied the ease with which I can clean my back with it.  Highly recommend if you want a &amp;#34;slightly rough&amp;#34; washcloth to help you clean easier.  The material rinses clean and dries fast, and does not hold smells or bacteria.  As cheap as they are on Amazon, try one!</li>
    <li> (JUST BE SURE THAT YOURS-RECEIVED IS A GENUINE &amp;#34;SALUX&amp;#34; PRODUCT, MANUFACTURED IN JAPAN [NOT in China], or its quality WILL NO-WHERE NEARLY MATCH THIS REVIEW)!&lt;br /&gt;If you DO receive a look-alike from an unscrupulous merchant and the package says &amp;#34;Made In China,&amp;#34; !SEND IT BACK IMMEDIATELY, UNOPENED, FOR A REFUND!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW OF THE ORIGINAL, &amp;#34;SALUX&amp;#34; JAPANESE-MADE CLOTH:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WATCH OUT DIRT AND BODY-GREASE...HERE IT COMES!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an almost-all synthetic, long washcloth with a REAL &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; propensity to &amp;#34;sloth&amp;#34; away dead skin, dirt and body oils that leave you feeling &amp;#34;invigorated&amp;#34; after every shower or bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They produce copious amounts of foam from small amounts of almost any body-wash liquid or bar soaps and the cloths, themselves, last me at least a couple of years before they must be replaced (always, because a couple of inches of their ends begin to tear off after that amount of time/usage, during the type of back-scrub motions as exhibited on the package&#x27;s front side)...I THEN continue to use the now-shorter, &amp;#34;spent&amp;#34; cloth for house-hold scrubbing of bath-stalls, stoves, ovens, soiled pots/pans, etc. This &amp;#34;recycling&amp;#34; act extends their VERY useful life-span ANOTHER few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It usually fully-dries in less then a couple of hours when hung from its end or draped in its middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S GREAT!! (especially if you&#x27;re really dirty and don&#x27;t have sensitive skin!!)</li>
    <li> I love my salux cloth. My skin is as soft and smooth as a child&#x27;s skin and I am 41 years old. I love it so much that I bought one for every woman in my family.</li>
    <li> These are the best bath clothes ever!  I buy a bunch every year for my family and to give them away to anyone who has never used one!  The price was the best I found on Amazon!</li>
    <li> These skin cloths are fantastic and accurately described and reviewed on line.  Will certainly be a repeat customer in the future!</li>
    <li> Very nice SCRATCHY exfoliating action. Makes tons of suds and just feels so daggone good! Very nice and long which makes it perfect to use on your back.  Can be folded with the soap tucked on the inside to more of a washcloth size.  You will need to use a different item to clean more tender areas if you get my meaning.  Def. not for those areas.  Really nice for whole body and esp. feet.</li>
    <li> This is pretty good, it exfoliates and is very cheap. It&#x27;s kind of harsh but you don&#x27;t need to scrub. It&#x27;s also a little big but that&#x27;s not a biggie to me... Definitely helped clear up some body problems. Totally recommend.</li>
    <li> Thick and just the right amount of scrubbing. I&#x27;ve used ones that were cheaper and they&#x27;re so thin you don&#x27;t feel clean. But these are great</li>
