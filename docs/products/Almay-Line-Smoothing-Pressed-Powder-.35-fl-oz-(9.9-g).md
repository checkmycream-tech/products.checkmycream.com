<ol>
      <li>RECOMMENDED SELLER EXCELLENT PRODUCT</li>
      <li>Makes my skin looks great!</li>
      <li>Great powder that absorbs oil and is not clumpy in humid weather.  </li>
      <li>I love Excellent product</li>
      <li>A great finisher on top of the tinted moisturizer I use as foundation, or by itself on days when I don&#x27;t have the time or energy to use anything but powder and lip balm.</li>
      <li>The price was great and the quality the same as always: Excellent.</li>
      <li>I like it so much, it has smooth texture and the perfect color for my skin</li>
      <li>My favorite powder.</li>
      <li>Good product, reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>but I am still satisfied with the product as a whole.</li>
      <li>Offers some coverage and lightly mattifies without settling into fine lines.  </li>
      <li>I love Almay and almost all their products but for some reason this powder leaves me looking shiny shortly after I apply it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use foundation underneath, and the powder matches my skin color pretty well.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Have been wearing this for years and looks natural, not cakey, on older skin like mine (61)</li>
      <li>This is the only one that does exactly what I want.</li>
      <li>It leaves a natural look.</li>
      <li>I like the coverage, not too heavy, not too light, and not shiny or sparkly like some powders</li>
      <li>No heavy fragrance either.</li>
      <li>and I like a natural look.</li>
      <li>I always check out new cosmetics and personal care products on ewg.org, and this rates well for safety.  </li>
      <li>But it could be due to the hot summer weather as well</li>
      <li>The only thing I wish is that it had SPF like my old Almay powder use to!</li>

    <li> I love Excellent product</li>
    <li> Offers some coverage and lightly mattifies without settling into fine lines.  Comes with an applicator puff but I use a powder brush and apply over a bb cream.</li>
    <li> Got a pristine package of expected content.  Great powder that absorbs oil and is not clumpy in humid weather.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Quizás quisiste decir: no me llegó el producto que encargue&lt;br /&gt;I do not get the product to commission</li>
    <li> I always check out new cosmetics and personal care products on ewg.org, and this rates well for safety.  I like the coverage, not too heavy, not too light, and not shiny or sparkly like some powders can appear.  No heavy fragrance either.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my mother, who only uses this powder. The price was great and the quality the same as always: Excellent.</li>
    <li> Sheer, matte, evens out my skin tones and does away with shine. A great finisher on top of the tinted moisturizer I use as foundation, or by itself on days when I don&#x27;t have the time or energy to use anything but powder and lip balm.</li>
    <li> I like it so much, it has smooth texture and the perfect color for my skin</li>
    <li> My favorite powder. For awhile I could not find this product anywhere and I thought is must be discontinued. Then I found it on Amazon. Yea! It doesn&#x27;t look caked on your skin or seem to just fill up pores. It leaves a natural look. I don&#x27;t wear tons of makeup and I like a natural look. This powder gives me the look I want. I have tried all types and brands of powder. This is the only one that does exactly what I want.</li>
    <li> Like this.  Use it daily.  Stays on well.  Very hard to find anymore.</li>
    <li> Good product, reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Have been wearing this for years and looks natural, not cakey, on older skin like mine (61)</li>
    <li> Totally hypoallergenic! Makes my skin looks great!</li>

I do have an oily t-zone so I usually have to apply a second time during the day but I am still satisfied with the product as a whole.
