      <li>The bottle was sealed properly and everything else was in good order, I just didn&#x27;t find the scent soothing.</li>
      <li>I have tried several blends, variety packs etc of essential oils and this is one of my favorite blends along with the germ fighter, good quality, well packaged,</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite EO blend.  </li>
      <li>in a diff-user,I like to just wear it on my skin or put some in a warm bubble-bath, In fact i am waiting for my next bottle to arrive!much cheaper than buying all of the oils separately!</li>
      <li>It made a very relaxing patchouli-like scent (which I love) &amp; enhanced my whole experience!&lt;br /&gt;Great product from EDENS GARDENS</li>
      <li>, maybe that&#x27;s the right word??  </li>
      <li>Product arrived early, packaged safely &amp; easy to open!&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
      <li>It has a calming affect, but I enjoy other Plant Therapy blends more.</li>

      <li>these oils are a really fun way for me to engage very finicky children.  </li>

      <li>This blend contains a combination of my favorite essential oils.  </li>
      <li>I really enjoy all of the ones I have tried so far.</li>
      <li>I first received I didn&#x27;t care for the scent</li>
      <li>Lovely scent that lasts a very long time.  </li>
      <li>Great blend and pretty affordable since the bottle will last a while if you use it like I do (a few drops at a time).</li>
      <li>Great a stuff especially if you have trouble clearing your head to get started.</li>

      <li>I use it in my aromatherapy diffuser all the time and find it very relaxing and calming.</li>
      <li>In no time, I was completely relaxed and was able to ease into a long meditative state.</li>
      <li>I purchased these oils because they were fairly highly rated</li>
      <li>and I have high hopes.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend Plant  Therapy  and their oil.</li>
      <li>I diffused it at work and the whole office nearly fell asleep</li>
      <li>Either that or it is very old.</li>
      <li>Careful pouring, drops come out quickly.</li>
      <li>It arrived 1/2 full due to a packaging problem but, nonetheless...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sort of a masculine, earthy smell.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Affordable quality essential oil.  Have many of their blends and have always been happy.  Also give as gifts to familiarize friends and family.  Works well in my difusser.</li>
    <li> Excellent oil.  Lovely scent that lasts a very long time.  I use it in my H2EO ultrasonic diffuser which I run for at least four hours at a time.  By the end of that time, the scent is only slightly diminished.  I will be purchasing more Plant Therapy oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  fast shipping, well packaged.  I highly recommend Plant  Therapy  and their oil.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, no problem.  Very light scent, helps me relax,smells great. I recommend it and will reorder when needed.</li>
    <li> Product arrived early, packaged safely &amp; easy to open!&lt;br /&gt;Used the meditation blend this morning in my oil warmer while I meditated! It made a very relaxing patchouli-like scent (which I love) &amp; enhanced my whole experience!&lt;br /&gt;Great product from EDENS GARDENS &amp; I would honestly recommend this to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Edens Gardens - you rock! :)</li>
    <li> bottled received open and only a little left in it so I tried it and I like it but I took off in the stars because of the damaged product.  5/15/15 I received an email from Plant Therapy that they will be replacing my order so when I receive it I will come back and change my rating</li>
    <li> I love this scent! Very relaxing!</li>
    <li> Good quality oil, but if I could have smelled it first, I would have bought something else.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy Plant Therapy oils as a brand.  I&#x27;m a licensed mental health practitioner that works with children and families with severe mental illness and these oils are a really fun way for me to engage very finicky children.  I purchased these oils because they were fairly highly rated and I didn&#x27;t want to make hundreds of dollars of investments into oils from some of the MLM brands out there.  Even the most resistant kids to services can&#x27;t help but ask &amp;#34;what are those?&amp;#34; and love to guess what smells are in each of the blends, using mindfulness skills to describe the oils.  The best part is that these oils WORK!  The blends that say they are calming, are calming, and the ones that promote energy and focus are that as well! I think that these are an excellent brand of oils to enter the world of essential oils.</li>
    <li> we are a huge plant therapy fan!</li>
    <li> This smells so good, it is so calming and wonderful to put into a mister, it has a perfect combination of scents.</li>
    <li> This was a great blend, really a blend for any time of the day. I used it heading out to work, during work, in the bath and even before bed.  I am on my way to purchasing more!</li>
    <li> I can now meditate deeply very, very quickly with the aid of this blend. Great a stuff especially if you have trouble clearing your head to get started.</li>
    <li> Love the scent of this oil.  I add it to my humidifier during my down time in the evening while I read a book.  Very relaxing.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I use it in my defuser in my bedroom. My husband likes it too and wishes it could run all the time. We are both in our senior years.</li>
    <li> This oil has hardly any fragrance, definitely not 100% essential oil. Either that or it is very old. Poor quality!</li>
    <li> Beautiful combination of scents that relax the mind and invigorate the spirit. Have recommended to many students. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> Not too pleased with this smell.... Neither were my clients :(</li>
    <li> Plant Therapy makes such awesome blends. I really enjoy all of the ones I have tried so far. I think Relax is my favorite but this is great also.</li>
    <li> Great price on this essential oil blend.  I use it in my aromatherapy diffuser all the time and find it very relaxing and calming. Plus it smells awesome!</li>
    <li> I have tried several blends, variety packs etc of essential oils and this is one of my favorite blends along with the germ fighter, good quality, well packaged, but it would be nice if they had more free shipping options available for this brand.</li>
    <li> The oil itself is good, but I&#x27;m not fond of the scent.  It&#x27;s a little.....pungent, maybe that&#x27;s the right word??  The bottle was sealed properly and everything else was in good order, I just didn&#x27;t find the scent soothing.</li>
    <li> AWESOME smelling blend! From an awesome company!!!</li>
    <li> I love this oil! In no time, I was completely relaxed and was able to ease into a long meditative state. I&#x27;ve also used it in my car vents to relax after a long day at work. I&#x27;m currently burning the oil which I know is not the best, but it still smells absolutely wonderful! I just purchased a whole host of Plant Therapy oils to add to my collection. They&#x27;re great for the price!</li>
    <li> Very pleasant scent....using it in diffuser in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> This oil smells very nice and should work well for the homemade soap that I will make to put it in.  I was looking for something to use that was not so \\&quot;girly\\&quot; smelling for my son and father and this will work just fine.  It arrived 1/2 full due to a packaging problem but, nonetheless...the oil smells great!</li>
    <li> It is a high grade oil that smells nice. What more can anyone say? It is very true to scent.</li>
    <li> This smelled awful~ like old musty shoes. The other odd side effect of it was that it it made me wired after putting a couple of drops on my pillow. Thought it be relaxing with a name like &amp;#34;meditation&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> i love this smell!  very relaxing!  with all the scents in this oil, the orange stands out the most to me...but its not strong, its very nice</li>
    <li> This blend contains a combination of my favorite essential oils.  The scent is light, not overpowering.  It&#x27;s very good for yoga, reading or any relaxing activity.  Careful pouring, drops come out quickly.</li>
    <li> Fantastic scent! I don&#x27;t know if this really helps encourage meditation, but it is certainly a wonderful scent. Will definitely repurchase. Excellent products and seller.</li>
    <li> Great product. I just love it. It does what it says, quality is wonderful. Will order again</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite EO blend.  I wear it every day.  As well as my kids!&lt;br /&gt;When I first received I didn&#x27;t care for the scent but once you put it on your skin it smells completely different!!!!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this item; whoever mixed this formula did choose cheap oils and did a very bad job on the scents.</li>
    <li> I was afraid to get this product because I hate the smell of Patchouli, but this wasn&#x27;t that bad. I use it when I clean my floors. I walked in the other day and felt like I was in a yoga studio.</li>
    <li> this smells wonderful and is very relaxing!Put in a diff-user,I like to just wear it on my skin or put some in a warm bubble-bath, In fact i am waiting for my next bottle to arrive!much cheaper than buying all of the oils separately!</li>
    <li> I really like the blend of oils in Meditation. I diffused it at work and the whole office nearly fell asleep :) It definitely helped me feel relaxed!</li>
    <li> I use this to help me sleep, it really works.  I usually just put a few drops on a tissue and put it under my pillow.  It&#x27;s sort of a masculine, earthy smell.  Very relaxing.</li>
    <li> I am having trouble sleeping and this is a product that I am hoping will help me relax enough to get more sleep.  I really haven&#x27;t had time to get any results but I like the way the product smells and it doesn&#x27;t overwhelm or cause you to lay there thinking about the smell.  I remember this same odor in the massage room back when I used to get massages.  I believe in time this product along with other methods will help me get my sleep pattern back and I have high hopes.</li>
    <li> Very nice oil. I use a couple of drops on my pillow to sleep. Good oil for heat therapy as well.</li>
    <li> Oh My Goodness, Turn me over and do it again!! I put a few drops into the whirlpool bath at home and just melted, Sooo relaxing it was hard to get out of the bath after, Definitely a stress reducer, Mind calmer, Body relaxer. I did the same for my Hubby and he loves it, I have ordered a second bottle even though this one should last a while but would never be without this essential oil. We both had a great nights sleep after the baths. In fact it&#x27;s 10:30pm at night and my hubby is zoned out in the tub again!!  Two happy baby Boomers.</li>
    <li> Great quality product but it&#x27;s a little musky smelling for my personal taste. I prefer the Relax formula, which is amazing.</li>
    <li> This is a very potent essential oil blend that smells lovely, mixes with other oils (should you want to dilute or layer the smell), and helps me relax. I sometimes rub a drop into my temples or combine it with some almond oil and apply it like perfume. Great blend and pretty affordable since the bottle will last a while if you use it like I do (a few drops at a time).</li>
    <li> I like this blend, especially if I am doing an evening yoga.  It has a calming affect, but I enjoy other Plant Therapy blends more.</li>
