<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> IT MAKES A STRANGE SOUND. i HAD THE EXACT ONE BEFORE AND IT DIDN&#x27;T MAKE THIS NOISE. NOT SURE WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THIS ONE</li>
    <li> Perfect for drying &amp; de tangling my preteen daughter&#x27;s textured hair.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, very wavy hair.  Thie straightener works well on my hair.  It is easy to use.  It also does not take a week to get my hair dried.  I cut my hair to shoulder length and found it does work better than on long hair, although I did get it to work on my long hair too.  I am very pleased with this product.  I definately recommend it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t find that this styler has any ability to straighten.  My hair is just as wavy and unruly using this to dry.  However I like the compact size and it is easy and comfortable to use for drying my hair.  Don&#x27;t expect it to do more, though.</li>
    <li> Works well.  The only problem is that is doesn&#x27;t work as long as traditional dryers. I just ordered my third dryer in 2 years.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves it&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;As for me I like the fact all I have to do is comb it through my hair</li>
    <li> This is a great product and the price is right!  My hair is naturally curly and can get very frizzy.  This allows me to have long hair that is not frizzy, smooth, shiny and still have some curl to it.  I usually dry my hair a bit before I use this dryer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read many reviews on this site -- some negative, some positive.  I have A LOT of hair.  My hair is full of texture.  My hair doesn&#x27;t grow down (length), it grows out (wide.)  I WOULD NEVER USE A HAIR DRYER BEFORE!  I couldn&#x27;t unless I wanted to look like a clown.  This product is the first product that allows me to dry my hair.  The product does get very hot!  That is what my hair needs to become straight and manageable, however.  If you don&#x27;t have frizzy and unruly hair, this is product was NOT made for you.  I, however, must say FINALLY!!</li>
    <li> I bought this hot styler first time 2 years ago..and it was a love from first sight. I have naturally curly uneven hair. And I just dry them using this hot brush- and they perfect in fast no time, no curling irons, no straighteners needed. I hate drying hair but with styler it is just a fun. I use it on wet and dry hair and they always look perfect. I order this item again and again. I cannot understand why only Conair has such wonder tool? What about other brands? I&#x27;m afraid one day Conair will stop production of this amazing tool. I hope it will never happen.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a styler to dry &amp; actually straighten my hair.  I think this one depends on yout hair type, mine is thick, wavy &amp; medium to coarse.  It does dry to my satisfaction but not straighten the way I need, I still have to use a flat iron to straighten.</li>
    <li> At first glance my initial reaction to this product was; my hair will laugh at this toy. I received my dryer a few weeks ago, and decided to try it out last night. I am astonished by how effortless this hair styler is to maneuver. It&#x27;s not bulky, it fits in the hand nicely, and gives off the right amount of power. Being a hair novice, the ease and promptness of the drying, straightening and styling has been a delight. So far so good.</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightner. I have tried others- and this works best! I also love that you can use one hand to hold a mirror and only need one hand to hold the straightener unlike most straightners. Also- this isn&#x27;t as bad on your hair as an iron since it doesn&#x27;t sit on your hair- you brush it through your hair. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding product, if you use it properly.  I just received my fourth one in about 8 years, because they do tend to stop working after a couple of years, but the product is so great and the cost is relatively low so it is worth replacing it as often as necessary.  The key to using it successfully, at least with my thick, wavy, above-shoulder-length hair, is to use a blow dryer or air dry until my hair is just barely damp, and then straighten and style it in small sections.  It produces incredible shine, body and style and reduces frizz in a very short time.  If you use it on wet hair it will take forever.  If you want to achieve lift and body use it under the hair; otherwise, to just straighten without adding extra body, use it on top. It also does of great job of flipping the ends either under or up, or you can leave them straight. It also works well on dry hair to revive your style between shampoos.</li>
    <li> the best hair product I&#x27;ve used until now already very good even though I commend to two friends who also loved. the best ever</li>
    <li> From my experience this product worked better with wet hair. The person that used this product has no product in hair. It&#x27;s true natural curl. The product worked really well and did great on keeping it frizz free and shiny. It left the hair bouncy and really straight. Worked better than any straightener I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I am horrible at blow drying my hair, so I was so excited to find this styler. It was super easy to use and fast. Yes, it doesn&#x27;t make your hair stick straight....it makes it even better. It makes my hair soft and great volume...love it.</li>
    <li> I have wavy / curly hair and had all but given up on ever wearing it straight besides when my stylist blows it out after my haircut.  Well, after receiving this styling tool, I have had great luck!  It is super easy to use, if you can brush your hair, you can use this styling tool.  Great, easy results quickly.  Definitely love it.</li>
    <li> Having gone from long hair to short I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do with it or how to get it to look like my hairdresser had styled it.  This nifty tool solved all the issues. I can go strait, add more lift even a bit of curl and it&#x27;s soft and natural feeling.  It&#x27;s the best styling tool in my large collection and I don&#x27;t need to use as many products.</li>
    <li> I have used many hand held dryers over the years. This is the only dryer that dries and straightens at the same time. Cant find in stores now. But excited I found it at amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine since 2005 and it still works. Before this I would buy blow dryers with comb attachments, but the heat would break the teeth. I hope it&#x27;s still being made if mine ever breaks.</li>
    <li> I am a natural 4a\4b hair type with very thick hair it usually takes some one with GREAT SKILLS to tame my mane but this product was perfect especially those who are not trying to retain heat damage it doesn&#x27;t get your hair flat iron straight if your of thicker hair like myself softer textures maybe , but it does make your hair 100 times more manageable if your natural 4a/b looking for a not so detrimental  way to manage your hair. Perfect .</li>
    <li> I had this item on my amazon wish list for a couple years and finally decided to just buy it for myself.  After just one use, I&#x27;m kicking myself for not buying it sooner.  It is so easy to use and my hair looks like I just went to the salon.  Seriously, I used the Infiniti for about 3-4 minutes on my damp hair and it looks SO GOOD I can&#x27;t believe it.  It was so easy, it was just like brushing my hair and the shine and body are only matched by a salon visit.  I have thick, short hair cut in a shag bob.  Try it...you won&#x27;t be dissapointed.  Wow!</li>
    <li> I have never found another like this. This is my second one. Thinking I should another.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that this would take the place of both blow dryer and flat iron, but it didn&#x27;t finish the ends of my hair smoothly enough to truly replace the iron.  Maybe with some practice using the cold setting to finish the ends, it will get better.  Here are some of the advantages of the product: 1) The ionic dryer doesn&#x27;t throw off extra heat (it goes directly to your hair), so I didn&#x27;t work up a sweat the way I do with my old blow dryer.  2) The built in brush is easier to use than holding a brush separately in your other hand, though the highest tension setting isn&#x27;t strong enough to grab my hair. 3) If you can just use this product without having to finish off with a flat iron (maybe if your hair isn&#x27;t so curly), then it&#x27;s faster than drying + ironing.  FYI: my hair is thick, between chin &amp; shoulder length, and pretty curly.  Overall, I think I will use it, but it&#x27;s not as miraculous as the ads (and some of the reviews) make it sound.</li>
    <li> this is a nifty gadget, but it will never work as a replacement for a straightening iron! it&#x27;s a good substitute for a blow dryer, and i enjoy using it on my shoulder-length thick, wavy hair for that purpose. it dries well, and takes less time than the blow dryer/round brush method, but i still have to follow up with the flat iron. This did NOT work on already dry hair. I purchased it at a Conair Warehouse sale for 10bucks, so i don&#x27;t regret the purchase, but I wouldnt be happy had i spent more money on it!    Summary: good as a dryer, not good as a straightener!</li>
    <li> This was an answer to my prayers.  Great for my natural African American hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this at CVS after reading the reviews here and at other places and used it once - Really liked the results - Straight but full hair, like twice the volume of a typical flat iron. BUT the next time I tried to turn it on - NOTHING - I tried different outlets, pressed the trip button on the plug... I returned it for another one thinking it was a fluke. I used it 3 times with GREAT results - and then went to use it the 4th time and again - it would not turn on. Just returned it for a refund. The price would be worth it if it actually worked more than a few times. I think Conair needs to figure out what the problem is and come back with a new improved model.</li>
    <li> I love this! I have curly hair and it&#x27;s sooo much easier to straighten when I use this first instead of a blow dryer. Nice and light and easy to hold for period of time!!</li>
    <li> I bought this item with high expectations, because of all the great reviews.  When I got it home and used it I was a little disappointed. First of all, it took a lot longer to straiten my hair than other people have said, about 45 to 50 min. Second, it didn&#x27;t really get my hair that strait. My hair is curly, medium thickness, and about three inches past my shoulders. I have to go over every section of hair very slowly several times if i want it strait. Even then it still has some wave to it. Over all it&#x27;s a good product, but if you want stick strait hair buy a flat iron.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It straightens as it dries. I was looking for a wet dry straightener this one does the job. I do agree for medium length hair. My hair is longer and thick so it takes a while to finish. The results are worth it</li>
    <li> I have very short hair that is thick and coarse with some wave.  I read all the reviews and decided to give this a try---it did work but, like another review I read, it left my hair fairly frizzy.  I tried a number of products to eliminate the problem but with no luck.  My hair didn&#x27;t look awful but it bothered me.  It was fairly easy to use although I found I did get better with practice.  The drying time was fine and overall, I was good with the way it worked.  I have stopped using it but may try it again at some point.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, curly hair and this just didn&#x27;t do anything for me. The brush was definitely not strong enough to get through my hair.</li>
    <li> Not good for natural hair.</li>
    <li> I owned this for less than 2 weeks when it stopped working and began to smell like it was burning. I returned it for a refund.</li>
    <li> I am the laziest person in the world when it comes to styling my hair.  I also am completely uncoordinated with a brush and blowdryer.  I have extremely thick hair (before my hair went curly - it used to take 3 perm solutions to have enough to do my hair).  My hair turned curly after I had my son.  I decided to try this product and it is amazing.  I can fully dry my hair in about 1/2 hour.  I did find that it was hard to get it to grip my hair if I just used it like a comb, but if I put it under my hair and used my other hard to press my hair into it - it worked great!  Completely straightens my hair and I can even make it curl under on the ends.  After your hair is dry and straight you can change the setting to cool and it even removes all of the annoying frizzies.  I find that I don&#x27;t even need to use a ton of product like I used to use with a flat iron.  I recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> Well - I just killed it. I guess my hot air styler sucked in one too many pieces of my hair. This has been an ongoing problem in the year I&#x27;ve had it. While doing a nice job at making my hair less frizzy and adding volume; it also ate my hair... a lot... despite all attempts to get my hair away from the air intake.    I just went to turn it on. No noise, no air, just a burning smell.    It worked really nicely though and I love the compact size, great for travel. I&#x27;m debating over getting another one. If I do, I&#x27;ll definitely register the warranty!</li>
    <li> I am 55 years old and have been trying to straighten out these curls since I was 12.  I don&#x27;t like using hair straightener at this age, because it appears to thin out my hair.  I have NEVER had a better tool to straighten my hair, and it actually helps keep it straight even in the rain.  It works on wet or dry hair, I think its absolutely incredible and I am very skeptical and fanatical about my hair grooming.  I can&#x27;t believe they FINALLY invented something this efficient and I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue selling it.  I&#x27;m surprised its not more well known.  Thanks Conair!</li>
    <li> Since I have short hair I was looking for something that would style my hair and also dry it at the same time. I love this. It take me no more than 5-7 minutes in the morning it gives you volume like you would not believe as well. Plus the price is right! The comb on it is small about two and a half inches so if you have a lot of hair or if you have long hair it would still work only it will take you longer to do. But for me it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have very curly corkscrew curls that I love but feel I look too young with. So, I straighten them now. This product will leave your hair straight and silky. I don&#x27;t know what people are doing who don&#x27;t have great results. You dry on hot first, I used 4 tension. Then when it is almost dry you switch to the low setting. Then, once dry you switch to cool setting but honestly I don&#x27;t use cool and my hair comes out great anyway. No frizz. You do have to prep your hair first with a straightening product and some leave-in-conditioner. It takes me about 30 minutes to dry my hair and it always look healthy. The down side is that I lost hair when I straighten it and it gets caught in the comb. I called Conair and a very nice woman helped me but she recommended to take out any hair you see after you style. I had waited a bit and now it is too late. I still use it with a lot of hair buildup but I am going to buy another and start all over to be careful next time. I can&#x27;t live without it! But like I said, the key is to prep hair first. I didn&#x27;t prep it first and just used gel and it wasn&#x27;t so sleek. PREP!</li>
    <li> This hot air brush drys my hair very quickly and the results are look very professional. My hair is straight and soft with lots of shine. It is much easier to work with than a hair dryer and brush.</li>
    <li> this is not what i wanted.i tryed to get a hold of someone to tell me where to send this back and no one could help me.they just shifted me around to some one else.i wont order again</li>
    <li> I have moderatly curly hair and have never known how to style it. I am uncoordinated with flat irons and round brushes with hair dryers. This thing is awsome. I can easily style my hair straight and not feel like I need an extra hand. It is adjustable depending how curly your hair is. It is easily packable for traveling. Apply straightning product, if desired, after you wash, then style when your hair is about two thirds dry, or if you wash your hair at night, just dampen it a little in the AM and style.</li>
    <li> I am really lazy with my hair, so not having to hold a bulky hair dryer in one hand and try to manipulate parts of my hair and hold a brush in the other hand is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually wash my hair at night - using this at night before I go to sleep, my hair still looks polished in the morning. So simple and easy!</li>
    <li> I had been struggling with finding an easier way to wash, dry, detangle, and straighten my daughter&#x27;s mane. I wasted my money on product after product until I found this wonderful little dryer on sale. I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot since I was running out of options. I bought it and have loved it!! It is no longer a pain to wash and dry my daughter&#x27;s hair because I am literally down to those two steps. I use it too (because we live in humid SE Georgia) to keep the frizzies away. I have not noticed any damage to our hair with this dryer because other dryers made our hair brittle and we were almost always air drying our hair. YES, a mess!! I have given away my other hair dryers and getting my replacement Conair because I know I&#x27;m going to end up burning this one out. So far though I&#x27;ve had it for 2 years, and it&#x27;s still blowing strong. For the price I paid for it, it met and exceeded my expectations.    PROS:  blow dries, straightens (not bone straight of course), detangles, easy to use, high and low settings, does produce nice shiny, bouncy hair. And, if sectioned off properly will dry hair faster.    CONS:  still able to burn little ears, but that was operator error - oops</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no women&#x27;s hair expert, but my girlfriend uses the Infiniti to blow out her hair into an afro and she&#x27;s commented that it&#x27;s the easiest and most convenient way to do it because she can replace the blow drying and the brushing with a single step.     I don&#x27;t see a lot about that particular use for the product, so I thought I&#x27;d mention it.</li>
    <li> It doesnt do anything to my hair but take an hour to dry it and make it frizzy. Doesnt do what it says it does. it makes it very poofy &amp; frizzy.</li>
    <li> This is one product I have been recommending without reservation for the past 3 years. At least 5 of my friends and relatives bought it following my advice, and they always got back to me with \\&quot;thanks\\&quot; and \\&quot;wow\\&quot;s. It is simply magic I&#x27;ve been searching for for a while, as I am lazy when it comes to styling, and simply don&#x27;t have the time (and the skill) to do justice to my haircut. With this dryer/styler, I achieve the salon look in 5-10 minutes. It is light and small and extremely comfortable to handle. My hair looks shiny, straight, and my short bob is in perfect shape. Another benefit is its small size, which makes it very portable (I never go on a trip without it, except to Europe, where I must live through my pre-Infinity nightmare without this styler). Without exaggeration, this is one of the top 5 products in all categories I have purchased from Amazon. Whatever other dryers/stylers you are considering, give this one a try, and most likely your search and your problems will end with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the best styler dryer that I&#x27;ve found  BUT it only lasts about  a year. I&#x27;ve been looking for another brand of this style dryer but haven&#x27;t found one yet.  It&#x27;s great if you don&#x27;t mind replacing it so often. They&#x27;re not cheap to replace.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I blew out my last one and couldn&#x27;t find it in local stores. Ended up buying two similar type stylers and hated them. I was thrilled to find this product still available online. I have wavy and frizzy hair and no other styler offers the kind of gentle smoothing and frizz control as this one. Because you can also use it on dry hair, if I&#x27;m caught in a drizzle and end up with frizz, I can touch it up in a hurry and look &#x27;salon ready&#x27; for anything later in my day.     Should add that the product life was likely shortened because I used it in Europe for 6 months and even with a converter, I think the unit got zapped.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes my hair extremely soft and manageable in the hot humid heat of the summer.I&#x27;d definitely buy another when  something happens to this one.</li>
    <li> I have owned two of these conair infiniti hair straighteners. The first one lasted about two and half years and I was very happy using it. I have MASSIVELY THICK hair that falls to my chest and this straightening is able to straighten it all up in about a half hour. Sounds long, but nothing else will work at all! So imagine how sad I was when the straightener died! I purchased another one from Amazon last June 2010, and guess what, it&#x27;s dead again. I went into use the straightener one morning and it wouldnt turn on, it just died. It didn&#x27;t even make it a year this time! I have read the manual a thousand times...I unplug it after, I keep the cord loose, I clean out the comb, I keep the vent clear - there is NO reason it should&#x27;ve stopped working on my end. Conclusion, my surmise is that this dryer has some sort of glitch, and there is no telling when each particular dryer will last. If you go to the conair site, this item is still patent pending... I wonder why? It&#x27;s been out for years. I am going to try to see about the 3 year warranty, but let&#x27;s be honest, how often are those honored. Overall, good straightener but youre playing rushing roulette on how long it will last.</li>
    <li> I have very short hair and although it works well, it is quite bulky to handle I wish I had a mini version</li>
    <li> I have fine frizzy wavy hair.  Flattening irons tend to leave my hair without any body.  The Infiniti BC173 smooths my hair and still gives it some lift.  It&#x27;s very easy to use which I like since I don&#x27;t enjoy spending a lot of time styling my hair. I&#x27;ve even used it when I&#x27;ve let my hair almost completely dry naturally and it has already started to be curly and frizzy and this dryer smooths it out. Amazing!!!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 years now and it still keeps working like new.  I&#x27;ve been thinking about buying another one in case Conair quits making them. I&#x27;m sure the one I have won&#x27;t last forever.  I hate it when I find something that works this well and then the company stops making it. Hopefully that won&#x27;t happen.  I don&#x27;t usually bother to write reviews but this product really deserves a good one.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s the wife&#x27;s,  all I know is she could not find it any  where but at Amazon she was happy  when it got here so I can&#x27;t complain</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hairdryer ever since it debuted. I have thick, shoulder length fine hair that is highlighted and a bit frizzy.  This dryer gets it straight and smooth.  I can create lift on top and soft curls or flip on ends.  I still use a flat iron sometimes to get a very sleek, straight finish, but it&#x27;s no longer the \\&quot;necessary\\&quot; step that it was before when I used a regular blow dryer. When I first started using it my friends asked me what I had done to my hair. On days that I don&#x27;t shampoo, I can easily revive my \\&quot;slept-on\\&quot; hair with this dryer- without wetting my hair.</li>
    <li> it works ok and that&#x27;s really all i can say, i just wasn&#x27;t impressed. i already have straight hair and i thought this would help eliminate using a straightener, i just like having that shine and sleeker look, well it didn&#x27;t really do anything a regular blow dryer wouldn&#x27;t do. i don&#x27;t recommend you waste your money.</li>
    <li> A flat iron does a better job. This device somewhat straightens, but it&#x27;s too puffy. You still need to finish the tips with flat iron.</li>
    <li> i bought my first one some time in 2007, my hair is shoulder length or longer and thick and naturally wavey, i was tired of having to use a regular dryer with one hand and a big roller brush with the other and i hated drying with a regular dryer then pulling out the flat iron and scorching my hair...it was PERFECT!!!it works fast, i can use it while my hair is still mostly wet, i let my hair air dry for a few, and i get alot of volume and the frizz is gone, its soooo easy to use and adjustable for hair thickness.. i didnt take very good care of it  you have to keep it clear of hair and clean out the vents and stuff.. and it burned out on me but i used it 3 times a week for 3 years ...  so i tried to go back to a regular dryer while i shopped for a new one, figured i could just go to the store and get a new one... wrong, i could only find them on amazon, it was an agonizing wait... longest 2 weeks of my life trying to remember how to use a plain dryer my hair was a mess..</li>
    <li> I have a long wavy frizzy hair which I always wanted somewhat straighter; but don&#x27;t have time or patience for a regular blow dry.     Keep in mind this is not a regular hair dryer, it&#x27;s less powerful because it stays closer to hair (so no scorching). In my opinion you have to know how to use it otherwise you&#x27;ll get puffy and frizzy hair.    What I do: start using the styler once hair is almost dry. Air dry or use the styler (hold far from hair to reduce heat damage).  Once almost dried, divide hair in sections (any way you want). I do 3 horizontal sections: closer to neck, middle and top/bangs. I begin with the \\&quot;closer to neck\\&quot; section.    Place the dryer at the root, leave it there for 2 seconds, then slide slowly to the ends. At the ends turn the dryer a bit to get nice looking ends. I do this process AT MOST 3 times on each sub-section, depending how dried my hair was to start with.     I&#x27;ve had for 3 years using 3-4 times a week. My hair is healthy and looks natural.</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t any better than the 10 year old curling brush I have under my bathroom sink. The kind girls used to feather their hair. It&#x27;s a hairbrush that blows hot hair. Not at all what I thought it was going to be. You are better off going to the drugstore and getting a hot air styler ,some with changeable brushes for 10 to 15 dollars.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product about 3 years ago.  Used it constantly.  Finally burned it out but since it worked so well, I was delighted to find one again on Amazon.  Whew!!!  I had looked in quite a few stores and couldn&#x27;t find it.  Don&#x27;t know what I would do if they stop making this.  Works great on my hair.  Has adjustable heat settings based on type of hair so make sure you select the right setting.  I didn&#x27;t do this at first and had the setting too hot for my hair.  My hair looks like its been done by a professional when I use the styler.</li>
    <li> I am a young black woman, have type 3C hair (Curly, Coily) that is relaxed and have had next to no luck when it came to hair dryers and NEEDED one since I am going to be spending the next year in Japan.&lt;br /&gt;Every time I would try to blow dry my hair with anything else, it would A) Take forever and B) Come out like I just stuck my finger in a electrical socket. Of course, I would flat iron afterward and my hair would be straight, but it wouldn&#x27;t be that &amp;#34;Salon Straight&amp;#34; (You know, the straight where you can do the &amp;#34;Hair Flip&amp;#34; and it comes back into place? When I did my wash &amp; dry beauty regimen, I would &amp;#34;Hair Flip&amp;#34; and it would freeze in place. &#x27;Twas quite embarrassing on those windy days. Quite.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, when my aunt suggested this to me, I was quite skeptical. I had the bigger sister blow-dryer (Model 208S, if you&#x27;re curious) and that was a good blow dryer...but still quite useless to my hair. So, begrudgingly, I paid the ~$40 for the Air Styler, expecting disappointment and sadness. (You know, the usual)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH. MY. SWEET. JESUS. I was WRONG. This Air Styler is absolutely FABULOUS. I feel like I just came out of the salon! My hair moves like it should and feels light and wondrous!!! I do have to go through with a flat iron or curl my ends...but the end effect is just so freaking amazing. WORTH IT!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking about buying this, don&#x27;t think – DO IT. It&#x27;s worth EVERY penny.&lt;br /&gt;Now, excuse me, whilst I break my neck doing the hair flip.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd one that I&#x27;ve purchased.  I burned up the 1st and had to have another. It takes my naturally curly hair to straight while retaining the body.  Love it!</li>
    <li> So first off, I want to say don&#x27;t go into this expecting your hair to look as good as if you paid for a blow out, it just won&#x27;t. You&#x27;ll need a boar hair round brush and fairly nice dryer as well as an arm coming out of your back and 45 minutes of your life to spare. If you&#x27;re like me though and generally just don&#x27;t have the patience or skill to deal with irons and round brushes and such, this is a great product. I have loose curls and medium thickness hair and this works best if I have the intention of getting it manageable and wavy/straight, which tends to look better on me than stick straight anyways. This requires zero skill to use and works very well. It gets plenty hot enough to dry my hair fast. It works best if you hold your hair taut while you go over it, since this thing cannot hold tension. I generally let my hair air dry to the point of being very damp, then run this over it otherwise it will take hours and hours (numb arms) to get dry. I bought some velcro hair straighteners on Ebay that keep it flat while it dries, and then this finishes the job. If there are some waves you can easily get them out with an iron. This is honestly a GREAT product for people like me who just don&#x27;t want to take time to fix their hair, but like it straight-ish. If you want it stick straight and are terrible with a round brush and dryer, this will get it mostly there, but you&#x27;re still going to need to iron it. Oh and it should be given that you&#x27;re going to need a decent product to protect your hair. I put some argan oil in and it was incredibly soft and wavy. I definitely do recommend this product for those of us who don&#x27;t have an hour to spend every day on our hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I decided I wanted my hair to get sleek with this and discovered a way to use this with a round brush to get it. Once you&#x27;ve gone over everything with this dryer and it&#x27;s a little poofy but mostly straight, take a section of hair and roll it around a round brush, then use this like any other hair dryer to give it a blast of hot air, and just heat it around the brush. Then hold the brush there, rolled up, for 15 seconds or so until it cools mostly and unroll it. This is much easier than trying to do the whole thing with a round brush, but still gives that sleek look with bounce and volume. I saw the woman who always cuts my hair doing this and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;m highly uncoordinated with a hair dryer (I usually hit myself, hard, in the head at least a few times), and I can easily manage this since I don&#x27;t have to multi-task with holding and sectioning things. You can put the dryer down, section and roll, then dry. You can also roll up a few sections of hair at a time in velcro rollers, heat them with the dryer, and unroll for a sleek shiny straight look. I almost looked like I&#x27;d been to a salon using this method and it took maybe 15 minutes from when I began drying my hair, and that&#x27;s with hair down to the middle of my back. I got many compliments including that I had \\&quot;beautiful mermaid hair\\&quot; from a kid.</li>
    <li> I really like the way this product works.   I have fine, wavy hair and this smooths it out nicely.   However, it&#x27;s not that powerful a dryer, so I always blow dry my hair first with a regular blow dryer until it&#x27;s almost dry.   Then I use the Conair Hair Designer.   What really bothers me about this product is that the motor burns out in less than a year.   I&#x27;ve had several of these and every one of them has had this problem.  I wish they&#x27;d make it easy to clean out the hair which invariably gets caught up inside the unit, but there is no way to take apart the dryer that I can see. I wrote Conair about it once, but I got no response.   After the last one gave out, I vowed never to buy another one.   But I have yet to find another product that works as well so I&#x27;ll probably give in and buy one.  However, I&#x27;m going to register it and if it fails within the year, I&#x27;ll go through the hoops and send it back to Conair.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these dryers a few years ago and loved it.  Unfortunately, it did eventually stop working and I was lost without it as Conair stopped making this particular one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled to see that they brought them back and ordered one immediately! I received it the day before yesterday and am happy with it, once again.  It dries my hair quickly and leaves it smooth and frizz-free.  I have shoulder length, fine, wavy hair and this is the only thing that really works for me.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Actually i was take it as a gift for my wife and she like it so much. it&#x27;s enoughe hot and have differint options to make differint style.</li>
    <li> POSITIVE: I got this as a gift last year for Christmas.  I have had the product for 1 year.  I do agree with the negatives about not drying quickly; thus, I left my hair air dry most of the way.  I then use the appliance to finish drying and straightening my hair.  It does get rid of the hair going OUT vs. down, and most frizz.  Honestly, it isn&#x27;t super smooth, but it is WAY better than before.  I have tried TONS of products and appliances on my hair, with no luck.  This is the only thing that has helped my hair situation.      Try using a de-frizzing product in your hair, air drying, and then finishing off with the straightener appliance.  Works for me!    NEGATIVE:  My appliance just went out last week.  Con-Air was not going to do anything for me as I don&#x27;t have the original receipt.  I waited 25 minutes to speak with the supervisor.  I honestly just got this last year for Christmas, and it has a 36 month warranty with receipt or 36 months from manufactured date.  My straightener was manufactured 2 years before it was purchased, which voided the warranty even though the straightener is just shy of 1 year old.  They are replacing it, but it is disappointing considering I know my mother spent a lot of money on this item (though I see it has come down in price quite a bit since last year).  I am curious if others have had a problem with the item going out?</li>
    <li> For years I blowed dryed w/traditional hair dryers that left my hair brittle. I saw a youtuber drying her hair with this which was very thick and kinky like mine and it came out beautifully!. This was worth every penny! I moisturize w/a lil hair butter and avocado oil and put a lil CHI Silk Infusion on my hair before blowdrying and it comes out sooo soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I switched from flat ironing to using the infiniti Pro by Conair. I will say that it is so much easier and faster than using the flat iron. I just towel dry my hair, add products to my hair, and just start brushing through my hair with the Infiniti pro until it&#x27;s dry.</li>
    <li> I blow out my hair with a 2000 watt dryer and the roots are always wavy b/c I punk out when it comes to getting close to the roots...this is a life saver and I&#x27;m serious...I&#x27;m not even sure how many watts but I have super curly hair (google Christina Milian) and if I take my time allowing the heat to penetrate, this gets my roots nearly pin straight...I know people say these break and die but I&#x27;ve had mine for close to 3 yrs and it&#x27;s still kicking but I may order 2 more just in case...I give this 5 stars b/c if it can get MY hair straight, it works...ps - I don&#x27;t have a perm or any chemicals going on so this is truly up against spiral curls at their worst lol</li>
    <li> ...sooo this works for me perfectly!  I have issues blow drying my hair while holding a brush at the same time.  This product combines the 2 and makes it easy.</li>
    <li> this product,saved my hair. with pains in my hands, I don&#x27;t have to hold a comb and blower dryer at the same time.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair dryer I have used.  My hair is a little shorter than shoulder length, curly, and thick. It takes me about 15 minutes to dry it and style it at the same time.  My daughter and I have used this product for about 9 years.  I used to use a round brush and a regular haidryer, i would have to stop because my arms would get tired and it took me longer to do my hair.  After using this product I have to say I will never go back to a round brush and a regular hairdryer.</li>
    <li> The product is okay for the price. However, having used used both Infinity and Instyler I must say I prefer the Instyler. I would pay the higher price.&lt;br /&gt;The Instyler holds more hair and as a \\&quot; Do-it-yourself\\&quot; product it is better, as I don&#x27;t have to hold my hands up as long a time as with the Infinity. I think it would be better for short and less thick hair.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite dryer of all time and when mine burned out I couldn&#x27;t find one anywhere.  I did find this one on Amazon. I had bought several other ones but was not satisfied until I got one of these again.  I am so happy to have found it.</li>
    <li> Was difficult and bulky to use. Tried it a few times and decided the effort was not worth the trouble.</li>
    <li> product being used by 10 yr. w/shoulder -length, VERY curly,tangled hair. She absolutely LOVES it - does it alone after her father went over instructions, precautions, etc. w/her. We have never even been able to get a wide-toothed COMB thru hair except immed.after it was shampooed/conditioned &amp; very wet. Now uses this on damp hair &amp; is done in less than 10 min. Wish we had learned abt. this ages ago - would have saved years of \\&quot;ouch, your hurting me\\&quot; sessions resulting in uncombed hair simply being pulled back w/covered stretchy band. She is sooo delighted - even has learned to \\&quot;flip\\&quot; the ends! PLUS - it actually stays the same all day-no styling product used, either!!</li>
    <li> This item is no longer manufactured.  Bought extra to get me by.  It is perfect for styling and smoothing curly frizzy hair like mine.  Does not seem to be for everyone especially those with really thick hair.</li>
    <li> The blowdryer arrived quickly and I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.  I have really curly hair and the blowdryer gets it straight, however, I still have to use a flat iron to get it \\&quot;bone straight\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> After much debating (I&#x27;m talking months), I purchased the Conair Infiniti dryer/straightener. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!!! I have slightly longer than chin-length hair, on the thicker side and wavy. I would usually blow dry with a round brush and then use a flat iron. What a pain! This styler is all I need - I haven&#x27;t gone back since I got it. Not only does it leave my hair straight, it gives it a decent amount of body and bounce - something the flat iron totally ruined. My hair is smooth and soft and feels considerably healthier since I nixed all the major heat on it. The only reason why I passed on five stars... I use a product/straightening gel on my hair to protect it from the heat, and after a while there was considerable build-up on the styler. I&#x27;ve recently started using alcohol wipes on it once a week to clean it as best as I can. I&#x27;m not sure how long that&#x27;s going to work though. Someone else had the same observation, but didn&#x27;t say how they resolved it. Overall I&#x27;m really happy with it and frankly if it broke tomorrow, I&#x27;d by another in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> I have finally found a hot air styler that works on my short, very thick, curly hair.  The product combines a dryer and styler into one making the job of drying and smoothing your hair much easier.  This styler is powerful enough to dry my hair while the plastic brush works well to soften my curls and help control frizz.  I also like the compact size.</li>
    <li> Not happy with the product. It made my hair split and it lasted only 6 months.</li>
    <li> Back in 1978, I purchased the Infiniti Pro Hot Air Styler from a local drug store. I liked its ease of use and the result I got from using it. Subsequently, I purchased 2 more from the same local drug store: one for my daughter and one for my granddaughter who was leaving for college. Theirs eventually stopped working - either from over use or misuse. My daughter borrowed mine and it suffered the same demise as hers. I was unable to replace the Pro because the drug store no longer carried it and my attempt to purchase it from Conair was unsuccessful as they also did not list it among their on-line products. I finally found it at Amazon and purchased 2 more. I plan to keep one and give the other to either my daughter or granddaughter as a Christmas gift.&lt;br /&gt;Since receiving my order, I have not used the Pro as I have been lazy and have been going to the hair salon. I expect to begin using mine during the winter when my laziness goes into overdrive and going to the hairdresser becomes more of a chore than a relaxing experience.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for giving me the opportunity to comment on this product.&lt;br /&gt;Carol Wong</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo319PC6UK6NB2X]]OMG.  This is the best product that I bought. I didn&#x27;t expect how great this is.  This is very amazing.  I have a long wavy hair and I don&#x27;t like it,so, I decided to buy this product and when I try it for the first time I was so amazed.  My hair came out straight, soft,and shiny.  I love this product. Highly recommended for those who have wavy hair this is the best hair straightener for you.</li>
    <li> I have a stockpile cause Conair stopped making. Easy to use and really smoothes the frizz.</li>
    <li> Dry hair super fast. Reduced the amount of time I normally take to part / section my daughter&#x27;s hair, who&#x27;s hair is ver full and thick. Works great!</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work, but my fine hair was blown off the brush.  My hair continued to be wavy and frizzy after use.  It&#x27;s going back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to use the brush stylers so I was kind of skeptical about this one but it&#x27;s a great hair dryer and straighter in one!  Don&#x27;t use it with your hair sopping wet though and you&#x27;ll get better results.  I have thick hair that&#x27;s wavy, not super curly, so it works perfectly!  Need to get a second one for the road!</li>
    <li> I have lots of fine, slightly wavy but mostly straight shoulder-length hair, grown out from a chin-length bob.  I LOVE this styler!  I wash my hair at night, let it air dry, and style in the morning with either a flat iron or big hot rollers. This morning I just used the Conair while my hair was slightly damp, and my hair came out great.  I used it on the \\&quot;4\\&quot; tension setting, which is supposed to be for thick hair, but the instructions suggested starting with that setting, so I did.  I honestly can&#x27;t tell a lot of difference in tension on the different settings, plus it&#x27;s VERY difficult to see the numbers (they&#x27;re at the base of the knob).  I only used the low setting, so I&#x27;m anxious to see how well it holds today.  I will try the high heat setting next time. It held my hair well without pulling, and is very easy to use. It really is just like brushing your hair! I held the ends of my hair with my left hand as suggested. I puchased mine locally as I wanted to be able to return it easily, but will probably now purchase another one from Amazon while it&#x27;s only $24 so I&#x27;ll have a spare!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this hair styler!  Works wonders on my thick and curly hair texture.</li>
    <li> I have fine medium length hair and I use this brush for quick touchups and in a few minutes I got the straight look I want, with shine! It is light-weighted and so easy to use. It also comes with a great three-year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of warning is: you cannot expect it dries your hair as quick as a powerful hair dryer. I would suggest you use your dryer first so your hair gets medium wet then use the hot brush.</li>
    <li> This is the first straightening tool I&#x27;ve seen that will work on short hair, and it does it well.  It&#x27;s much easier to use than the ceramic plate straighteners. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My biggest problem is getting frizzy hair when it rains or the humidity is high, and just combing this over my hair did a great job controlling the frizzies.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It does NOT dry hair that well, esp. if you have thick wavy hair like I do, but I generally let mine air-dry for 20 to 30 minutes before styling it.</li>
    <li> I gave a very favorable review to the Infiniti tourmaline hair designer, the hair dryer sold by Conair as an accompaniment to this Hot Air Styler.  I tried the Hot Air Styler because it was light weight, and also appeared to be lighter and more portable than the dryer.  As it happened, two hours after the Styler was delivered via Fed Ex, I got caught in a rainstorm while running and was able to test the Styler on my very wet, long, curly hair.  It appears to work as well as the hair dryer and is also highly maneuverable.  In fact, I think that you might want to try it before either purchasing the dryer or buying both items together as Amazon suggests.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good. i prefer to dry my hair a little with a regular blow dryer and then use this to style.</li>
    <li> From an Afro-American perspective, which is what I look for when deciding whether or not to purchase hair appliances, this dryer is okay. By no means does it completely straighten your hair but it does dry it quickly and make less work for the flat iron. It is a good option if you use the blow dryer without the comb attachment because it does not pull your hair but still allows you to dry it straight. It is perfect for little girls.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length curly, fine hair.  I followed the directions for use and I ended up with a messy head of frizzy hair.  The brush does more blowing than straightening in my opinion - it is fine for drying hair.  But I did not get the sleek, smooth, shiny effect that was promised by the straightening tool.  It was nothing like the salon straightening job I normally get.  I will be returning this styler ASAP.  Very unhappy.</li>
    <li> This one works, but it&#x27;s tough to get the teeth to grab to the hair.  You need more tension to get it to make hair smooth and straight. Needs more manual assist than I thought.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length, wavy/curly/coarse hair that I never know quite what to do with. I&#x27;ve never been good at anything \\&quot;girly\\&quot;, and that includes blow drying my hair. Coordinating a blow dryer AND hairbrush? Not in this lifetime! This dryer does a decent job of making my hair smoother and straighter, but not stick-straight (which is OK with me). As far as drying, it isn&#x27;t too powerful, so I usually let my hair air-dry for a while and then use the Infiniti. What I like best is ease of use; just like brushing your hair!</li>
    <li> am very well satisfied</li>
    <li> Like a lot of reviewers, I have medium length, thick, wavy hair. I&#x27;ve been either using a hair dryer and a round brush, a flat iron, or a curling iron (or any combination of those) for years. I&#x27;m pretty good with a brush and a hair dryer, but I hate how much space they take up in my bathroom and, particularly, when I travel. When I saw this hot air styler, about the size of a flat iron, I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. It&#x27;s definitely easy-to-use if you take small sections at a time, and it has a long cord that makes it very maneuverable. I won&#x27;t say it gets your hair as flat and straight as a flat iron, but I don&#x27;t like my hair super sleek like that anyway. I have used it twice now, and I&#x27;m very satisfied. However, each time I&#x27;ve used it, my hair has been very wet, so it takes a while to dry. In the future, I&#x27;ll let my hair air-dry for a while, and then use the styler. I would definitely recommend this, not only because it works well, but mostly because it saves space!</li>
    <li> I have had problem hair all my life...thick, frizzy, unmanageable...this styler, in less than 15 minutes, transforms my hair to straight, soft, and manageable....just LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I have long (to the bottom of my shoulder blades), thick, wavy hair and even though this is recommended for short to shoulder length hair, it works very well for me, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It used to take me about half an hour to dry my hair straight, then another 40-45 minutes to straighten it with the ceramic straighteners.  Now I can dry and straighten in just over 15 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I section my hair into thinner layers, like they do at the hairdressers - that way it dries quicker.  Then, when it&#x27;s all dry, I go through it for a couple of minutes with the styler on the cold setting.  This smoothes my hair and takes away the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used correctly, I think this styler should suit all hair types.  I am a very happy girl!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have &#x27;Ever&#x27; rated a product!!...Why has no one thought of this sooner?..towel dried my daughters hair, I used John Frieda products, and first it dried her hair in record time, keep in mind she has naturally curly hair and soon I noticed a straightening effect which cut the whole process at least in half!..love this styler!..only thing is my teeth setting didn&#x27;t work or maybe it was so gradual I couldn&#x27;t tell, plan to do more research on that, but I will be getting another one just to have!</li>
    <li> This is the third Conair Infiniti that I have purchased and love it more than any other blowdryer I have owned.  The only complaint that I have is that it needs to be replaced about once a year.</li>
    <li> This product was a completely disappointing i hate it . it does nothing it says it does .&lt;br /&gt;It does nothing for my hair , it does not straighten it , it leaves it looking dull and wavy .</li>
    <li> I have gone into some research on ConAir products.  I have come to see that this comapany does not have it&#x27;s priorities straight. I&#x27;ve heard the Customer Service isn&#x27;t even effective! SOME of this particular company&#x27;s products are marked as a rip-off.  Why is it that some times when you buy a Con Air product, it works, and other times it doesn&#x27;t.  I am ANNOYIED that this company sells thousands of defective products and gets away with it too!  Look at the facts ladies and gentlemen, about 1/3 of the Infiniti by Conair BC173 Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Wet Dry Straightening Hot Air Stylers that were purchased and reviewed had been defective or did not get the job done as well as expected!    We can not expect perfection from any company.  But buying this product is a GAMBLE!  Like any product on the market of course.  We can not always be sure if we will get what we paid for.  I hope this helped you make up your mind- I know I am sick and tired of wondering if anything will work out the way I want it to.      Spend wisely! Shop with Caution!  E.V.E.</li>
    <li> This product was so awful, I returned it - something I RARELY do.  It didn&#x27;t dry or straighten well.  My dryer and round brush were far superior to using this.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very dissapointing!  It did dry(while it was working) my very curly,frizzy hair, but left  it just as frizzy and curly. I still needed to use a flat iron after it.  But then it just stopped working. I plugged it in, turned it on and it made a strange humming sound, and that was it.  It was functional for 6 months.  I can&#x27;t say that it worked for 6 months though because even though the unit did turn on and dry my hair, it did nothing in the way of straightening my hair.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on it.</li>
    <li> I have curly, frizzy hair and thought this would be a great product.  It did not do a good job.  My hair still had a frizz to it and it took awhile to dry.  I returned it,I still do like conair products, just not this one.</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this product for her use. This product worked well and she was happy with it until...she rec&#x27;d a shock to her little finger while drying damp hair to discover 4 months later, she has permanent nerve damage to this finger. ouch!! She has not used it since being shocked.</li>
    <li> This seemed to work fine, but within a few minutes of using it the higher speed setting broke. High speed and low speed are the same now, it doesn&#x27;t go higher. Not sure how the rest of it will hold up, but I&#x27;ll use it for now.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hot air styler in hopes that it would dry my damp hair without damaging it!  I now a lot about hair and haircare and I know that I shouldn&#x27;t have had that much hair on my floor after using this thing.  It dried my 60% air dried hair well and I liked the silky feel of my hair, it seems to seal the cuticles well. It doesn&#x27;t get very hot but it gets hot enough to get the job done.  But those teeth ripped my hair out!  I&#x27;m taking it back.  It&#x27;s too damaging and I&#x27;ve put too much into taking care of my hair to allow this appliance to be my downfall! I have thick relaxed AA hair.  Those teeth just aren&#x27;t good for my hair!</li>
    <li> Love this. Received this last week and so far have been very impressed. I had trouble blow drying my hair so this is the perfect solution. It doesn&#x27;t get my hair as straight as the flat iron but it&#x27;s less damaging to the hair. Doesn&#x27;t weigh too much. Just perfect.  Product also comes with hair bands and hair clips. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have never been very coordinated with the whole hair drying and brushing idea and was afraid to try a straighting iron.  This straightens with tension and is pretty simple to use.  I have even used it on my kids!</li>
    <li> My favorite blow dryer I love it. Was recommended by a friend. Blow dry and straighten at the same time</li>
    <li> Love it!  This is my third one over many years.  Now I have one for home and one for travel.</li>
    <li> I returned it,  it wasnt want I wanted -  i was looking for the spin rod and brush.  easy return</li>
    <li> I used the styler for the first time today. It worked well on my hair which is fine, very wavy, shoulder length, but lots of it. It tends to sit flat on my head but puff out at the ends. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I used the styler on the hot setting, when my hair was damp and with a straightening product. It took the same amount of time to dry as with a blower and brush. It worked particularly well adding volume to the crown and reducing the puffiness at the shoulders. (The instructions describe how to reduce or add volume.)  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My hair looks as good or better as when I leave the salon. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I found this product at Target for around $50.  I was so excited to buy it after seeing the commercial! I thought it was going to the answer to all my hair problems! Well, sorry.... nope.  I&#x27;m not saying it was awful... but it took me a LOT longer than my usual routine which is quickly blow drying my hair and then going over it with a big-barrel curling iron.  So it took longer, and my hair wasn&#x27;t that smooth. Then I went outside and it immediately got wavy and frizzy.  LUCKILY, I had asked the lady at Target when I bought it if I could return it if I didn&#x27;t like it, and she said I could. So, back to the store it goes tomorrow!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work!!!!! At all waste of money... Very disappointed with this product . Not what I was expecting out of it</li>
    <li> When I first saw this product I thought its probably the same as the others I have tried and wasted my money on.  But when I frist used the Infiniti I really was so pleased. I have shoulder lenght curly, frizzy hair and I needed something like this just to comb through my hair and dry it. This really did the job. It didn&#x27;t straighten my hair like it says it does,but it did smooth my friz out and makes my hair look healthy. I really am glad I got the Infiniti.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time. I receive product in a timely manner. I am enjoying product. It dries and straightens hair at the same time.</li>
    <li> Works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;Except that the blow drier isn&#x27;t very effective and doesn&#x27;t dry my hair completely. I dry my hair a little with a separate blow drier and then use this styler.&lt;br /&gt;Adds volume to my thin hair.</li>
    <li> This product is okay, but does not do what I had hoped that it would.  It does not get hot enough and it doesn&#x27;t blow enough air to do what I had hoped.  A blow dryer or a straightening iron work better than this item on curly or frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this product.  I have wavy/curly hair just below my shoulders.  My hair is thicker than most.  The product works, but took FOREVER.  You have to take really small sections, and go over each section a few times.  By the time I was done I was soaked with sweat!  I think it would work much better for shorter hair.  I&#x27;m back to my round brush and flat iron.</li>
    <li> After reading some of the reviews I bought this &amp; used it yesterday. It took about 15 minutes to dry my shoulder length wavy hair.I found it a bit difficult to hold when styling my hair - drying the angled front was especially tricky &amp; I didn&#x27;t get the long lasting smoothness I was hoping to get. However, when I had initially dried my hair it looked smooth &amp; sleek. Unfortunately it frizzed back up during the day (I live in San Diego not somewhere humid) so I am going to try again using smaller areas of hair. If anyone has any styling tips for using this, I&#x27;d love to hear them.</li>
    <li> My sister sent me this product to try out, she had bought it and did not like it. She doesn&#x27;t separate her hair into sections, and I do when I straighten it and so she thought it might work better for me. I don&#x27;t like it either. It dried my hair no problem and I love the idea of skipping a step, but it just doesn&#x27;t straighten like my regular flat iron does. I have a chin length bob but my hair is fairly thick and slightly wavy.     It may work better on finer hair, I don&#x27;t know. Definitely try this product out before you buy it.</li>
    <li> I got this stuff as a gift in europe but because of the voltage i gave it back and bought it here in USA. The USA version looks pretty much cheaper and poor made than the (same brand-model-etc.) european version. I used it once with hardly satisfactory results, the second time something burned inside and start smoking. I wouldnt recomend it to anybody...</li>
    <li> I have very fine curly, often very frizzy hair...and normally have left it curly as I could never ever get it straight on my own...and would always love getting it blown out at the salon when I&#x27;d get a cut cause it looked so good and so different and everyone would always marvel at how different I looked (and better I think they meant lol) but I bought one of these just to see what it was like...and actually just bought my 2nd one thats still in the box!!  I just never want to be without one so have a spare one now.  Not only can I dry my wet hair without the annoying discomfort of trying to hold the dryer and big brush up for long periods of time (I have shoulder length hair) and always able to get the sides nice but never the back----with this dryer, not only can I completely dry my hair in about 15-20 minutes....it straightens as it drys....and my hair is extremely straight, NO FRIZZ AT ALL...and soft and silky!  I only wish this would have been around years ago when I was in high school and college as I could have had straight hair too....if you&#x27;re looking for a dryer, straighten...all in one...THIS is your baby!  I love this thing...rave to anyone that will listen...ITS THAT GOOD!!!</li>
    <li> That is the BEST description of my hair. I am a African American woman, with 4C hair, that has hair that ISN&#x27;T processed or chemically straightened. After reading other peoples reviews and watching their videos of this product, I just had to try it for myself. I received it in the mail this afternoon and was dying to try it. I used it on my hair 10 minutes ago. My hair came out like \\&quot;BUTTER!!!!!\\&quot; I mean, my hair is so silky soft and straight. I do have to say, this hot air styling tool didn&#x27;t get has hot as my regular hair dryer and that&#x27;s o.k. These results where much more better and far more that what I expected. As long as you take the time to getting to know this product and get it to work best for your hair type, you could really enjoy this product.</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy, short hair and I use it on my dry hair to easily straighen and smooth my hair.  I use it every day and would not want to be with out it. I think I&#x27;ll buy another and keep it at work.  Two girls at work told me about this dryer and I&#x27;m glad they did.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer. I&#x27;ve tried several hand held dryers and my number one complaint was over heating. But not this one ! I also own the larger infinity blow dryer,that works well for my daughter&#x27;s hair (64&amp;#34; of African American hair) but is very awkward to hold for blowing my own hair. So I  tried this one. It is well worth thd fifty dollars I paid.  My arms aren&#x27;t as tired and cuts down on time as it straightens . Probably best on thick or corse hair because of the metal plates. Never over heats.  Must try it.  Update, 6/14/16, I&#x27;ve had this dryer for a year now and it&#x27;s still working pretty well.  I have added a few pictures and I&#x27;m also showing the larger dryer that I use on my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Very. Happy with it i order 3 for a gift</li>
    <li> Great gadget for shoulder length hair. Blow your hair with a regular hair dryer first and then use the conair BC173 and you can have faster results.  Hair is shiner and feels great.</li>
    <li> Not much has been written for the girl with a bob type style.(or shorter length)..I have rather thick hair,however it is straight with a few wavy areas in the back,\\&quot;anyhoo\\&quot; it&#x27;s always hard to get a round brush with a hair dryer in the back plus be able to see what it is your doing, with this tool it&#x27;s a piece of cake....It&#x27;s just like brushing your hair, your hair depending on your preference can flip up or down, while staying completely straight....It&#x27;s awesome If this works great for girls with hard to manage hair just imagine with normal hair. This brush dryer straightener is light and easy to maneuver no need to be a professional to operate. If you can brush your hair you certainly will love how this works...Best thing I have bought for myself in years! I&#x27;m ecstatic I made this purchase...&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;I dry my hair with a blow dryer (it&#x27;s quicker) until it&#x27;s just a \\&quot;tad damp\\&quot; (or if I have time, air it almost dry)I think I like my results better when I work with it while it&#x27;s not quite dry, I then go in and finish drying and styling with this Styler.....After you have used it a couple times you&#x27;ll figure out neat things you can do with it. I get lift in my crown area by holding the section up and griping it with this tool...LADIES you have to invest in this you won&#x27;t be disappointed..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it is new I can&#x27;t speak to the longevity of the motor or other operational features only time will tell. I certainly know as long as they make this I will be buying it,as needed....Thanks, Conair....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK it&#x27;s been awhile now the motor is still going very strong however, I did buy another one! I need to have an extra styler just in case something happens to the one I have. I LOVE it that much!</li>
    <li> I have medium thick hair with natural body. I love how this worked, BUT I&#x27;ve been through 2 so far, shopping for a third. They overheat too easily. My first burnt out in the first use so I returned it to the store. The 2nd lasted about 2 years. The internal fuse would blow after almost every use,then come back on later and I never used it on HIGH. This time, I&#x27;m buying [[ASIN:B003OXEJSE Conair Infiniti Pro Nano Tourmaline Ceramic Ionic Hot Air Styler Straightener]]. It has 2 rows of ceramic teeth and looks a bit sturdier. We&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> I do not like doing my hair.  I am mixed with curly hair.  I hardly go thru the trouble to straighten it becasue, perms dont take, I hate that burnt hair smell from flat ironing &amp; rollers take too much time, just for a stlye to last until it gets humid.  My mother sent me this AND I LOVE LOVE LOVE it.  I wash my hair.  May or may not air dry, blow dry or even all wet and use this to dry.  But it straightenes TOO! And I have a friend who has nornal hair and she loves it.  My sister locves using it on both her hair and her sew-in hair.  The bad review, cant say what went wrong.  But Im on here now looking for one for a friend (because I really dont want to let mine go).</li>
    <li> My hair is very curly so i wasnt expecting much from the product but it really made my hair straight! I&#x27;m happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Love using this hair dryer. No more frizz. I have African American relaxed but still thick hair. I have short haircut but my hair usually takes a long time to dry. This hair dryer saves me time on blow drying and doesn&#x27;t fry my ends. My hair comes out silky, shiney, and no frizz. Natural sheen. Does not require any hair products in order to use. Light Weight. I just brought a family member one off of Amazon.com for Christmas after testing it on her hair. She has fine but frizzy hair. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length, highlighted hair with some natural curl.  Using a flat iron after blow drying takes time so I was looking for something the help eliminate a step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Creates shine - even on dry, highlighted hair!  Unit is lightweight and easy to use.  Doesn&#x27;t get too hot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  The brush part needs to be wider!  With a little more surface area, you could dry larger sections and actually produce a bit of a curl on the ends if you wanted to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results, you need to dry the hair in sections.  Trying to comb thru large areas just doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair does feel great after styling - that hard to achieve smooth, soft salon finish we all love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not bad for around $20</li>
    <li> I loved the first one so I bought one for my daughter.  Then my original hair styler quit working after only a few months&#x27; use.  I hope I have better luck with the replacement.      I have long, thick wavy hair so I will give the product the benefit of the doubt.  It is very effective in taming friz and waves.  Now I can dry my hair in only a few minutes.  Love the features of this dryer.</li>
    <li> Good product and very reasonably priced.  This product will straighten your hair, if this is what you are looking for. It did for me, but I had to  persevere until I was used to the way the product should be used</li>
    <li> This is actually the second Hot Air Styler I&#x27;ve bought.  After I burned the first one out after five years, I wasted no time in purchasing another one.  I am one of those people that simply can not maneuver a blowdryer and a round brush to tame my coarse curls.  Drying my hair with this styler is as easy as brushing my hair.</li>
    <li> I just received and used once.  It really straightened my hair very nicely.  My hair was semi-dry, so I will have to update when I try it on wet hair.</li>
    <li> When i used this all it did was smooth out my hair and added flips at the ends. It does not make you hair bone straight. As soon as you go outside your hair is puffy again. It does the same thing as my old $20 styler did. I guess using this to dry your hair and then use something else to straighten it would work. But why should i have to buy a second straighter when this thing suppose to do it for you. I also think the model on this box actually has naturally straight hair that is why it is so straight and smooth. Luckily i  took it back and got a complete refund. I guess i will stick with my old straightner.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer! I have medium wavy hair with a tendency to frizz. Before this hair dryer I had to use curlers to keep the frizz away. Now I just use a little anti-frizz product on my wet hair, partially air dry, and finish with the hair dryer. My hair looks like it was professionally styled! I love how I can control how staight or curly I want it. Also this works great for touch ups.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find anything any better about this than the Chi Mini Flat Iron that I already have.    I followed all the directions and I couldn&#x27;t style my short, somewhat wavy hair with it.  Probably works best on medium to long hair, something the info for this failed to include.</li>
    <li> My hair is both thin (thanks to a thyroid problem) and very fine (since birth), and the blower is so powerful I can&#x27;t keep the hair in the teeth to style it.  For someone with somewhat coarser and/or thicker hair it might be fine, but for me it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This ia my third dryer in the last year and I love it! It straightens and smooths out my normally fine, frizzy hair quickly and works on dry or wet hair! And it stays smooth! I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews, good and bad, I decided to chance buying this hair styler. I followed the suggestion about letting my hair get nearly dry before using this, and it works so well for me! Makes it look full and shiny, styles it straight, curved under, or flipped out - however I want. I&#x27;m really glad I bought it, besides I got it for $20 less than on the Conair website with free shipping to boot!</li>
    <li> This dryer actually works as it claims to!  I have fine, curly hair that frizzes in humidity, no matter what I do.  This dryer cuts it down drastically- not eliminate, but does make my hair smoother and softer.  I have just about every hair appliance and product made for the mass market and this is one of the better ones.  I also have the blow dryer that matches this comb type drier and this works better and faster than that.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be as hard on my hair also. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Ok for those of you with turly curly hair.  I mean I stuck a finger in a light socket, got teased horribly in school &amp; can dive into a pool twice before your hair gets wet curly hair.  This is for you.  I won&#x27;t give you that shiny straight Demi Moore look.  You will still have to run a hot iron or straightner over the ends.  But what it will do is reduce the volume of your hair and there must be something to those ions.  I tested this baby in the worst weather conditions, humidity and cold.  My hair did not \\&quot;puff up\\&quot; or get horrible frizzies. Use it instead of a blow dryer and be sure to use your regular product.  It takes a little bit longer to dry my hair with this then a regular blower but I don&#x27;t soend another 35 with a curling iron and straightner.  I now use a hot iron to curl the ends and get the hair straight on my crown and roots.  I would absolutly recomend this item for those who have battled frizzy curly hair all their life</li>
    <li> This is an amazing styler.  It saves time and damage to your hair by drying and straightening (or flipping the ends).  It is easy to handle and works on my fine hair as well as my daughters curly and thick hair!!!&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair soft and shiney!  Style stays in until you wash your hair.  Also very nice for touch ups - mist hair - and style.</li>
    <li> I have a hot air brush which takes FOREVER to straighten my naturally curly &amp; thick hair. Even once I&#x27;d gotten it straight, it was frizzy and just did not hold style well. Then I&#x27;d started using one of the Conair tourmaline brushes and LOVED it because of how well it gets rid of frizz and controls flyaways and wanted a tourmaline hot air brush for Christmas. My dad picked this Infiniti and WOW it works wonders!!! The first time I used it my hair was about half way dry and it worked perfectly, not only straightening and controling the frizz but also my hair felt so soft and the style stayed all evening!!! This morning I felt really brave and used it on my very wet hair about 10 minutes before I had to leave for work!!! I thought there was no way it would dry in time! It did my hair in 8 minutes and almost completely dryed it! It has been about 4 hours and after coming in and the wind blowing, it still looks FABULOUS!!! I cannot recommend this thing high enough!! No complaints! I read the directions and use it as advised. LOVE IT!!! ROCK ON, CONAIR!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this hair dryer.  First, months ago I had bought the larger Infiniti styler and hated it ~ it burned me, was difficult to use, and I ended up returning it.  I have used hot air brushes in the past, though, and because it takes me so long to dry my hair I decided to try this Infiniti hot air brush to see if it would make my routine easier.  I was very skeptical based on my experience with the other styler, but this one is well worth every penny, and more!  When I blow dry my hair using a normal hair dryer I end up looking like Bozo the Clown ~ poofy, frizzy hair that I then need to spend 15 minutes taming with my CHI hot iron.  With this Infiniti, all that has changed.  It is incredibly easy to use, quiet, and leaves my hair straight and not frizzy or poofy.  First, I will say this takes longer than my quick-dry Revlon tourmaline dryer, but I usually let my hair air dry a little while I do my makeup and get dressed.  Then I section my hair ~ I use a clip to put all but the lower part of my hair and then use the styler on a 1\\&quot; piece at a time, running it over and then under the hair.  Once the lower section is done I let down the middle section of my hair, and then finally the top.  When I&#x27;m done my hair is soft, shiny, and straight.  I do go over it with my CHI to \\&quot;seal\\&quot; the hair and make it extra-straight and frizz-free.  That part only takes about 5 minutes.  All in all, this appliance has made drying my hair (something I used to absolutely DREAD) much, much easier ~ it&#x27;s as easy as brushing your hair, and the results are wonderful.</li>
    <li> My cousing is a hair stylist and I&#x27;m not a hair salon person but I like to have my hair straight. She recommended me to use this ceramic straightening product for drying and straighting purpose.  The hair looks great, most likely a salon finish. (my hair is curly, thin and dry, its very long too) and It takes me about 40mins to dry it up.</li>
    <li> If you have never used a flat iron before, don&#x27;t even bother.  This product does not come even close to the results I get when i use my flat iron. A waste of money, to say the least.</li>
    <li> This is best for hair no longer than shoulder length as the box states.  I have chin length hair and now this is the only product I use and it does make it feel smooth (if you read your instructions).  I wish I had gotten it sooner.</li>
    <li> Conair doesn&#x27;t seem to be making my favorite hair dryer anymore. .so I was so happy to find it on Amazon. .</li>
    <li> I just happened upon this item when at the grocery store. I had recently purchased the Instyler that&#x27;s so talked about and it was junk...burned the ends of my hair. I was going to purchase a flat iron to do the final straightening after blowdrying but this wet/dry blow dryer peaked my interest. I&#x27;m the queen of returning things so figured I had nothing to lose.     I&#x27;m a red head and have to deal with the usual wavy, somewhat frizzy (in humid conditions)problems what seems to come with our hair color. Normaly I blow dry my hair with a comb attatchment to get the curl out. I have to have the dryer on the hottest setting to achieve results.  In the summer, by the time I&#x27;m done, I&#x27;m usually sweating because of the high heat needed.  Well, NO MORE!  I just got done using this new Conair product for the 1st time and I LOVE IT!!  I washed and towel dryed then started in.  I used the hottest heat setting to get the initial moisture out, and as my hair became dryer I switched to the low setting.  It worked like a charm, and no sweat dripping down my neck afterwards.  I&#x27;m telling you that this product suits my particular needs perfectly.  I don&#x27;t want the sleek straight look.  Just straignt.....with body.  That&#x27;s EXACTLY what I got!  This styler is so, so light and easy to handle. You can very easily flip the ends of your hair under or up.  I paid $50 for it.  I would pay $200 at the drop of hat.  When one has battled a head of hair like I&#x27;ve had to do for (ahem) 55 years, it&#x27;s a thrill to discover a product like this. Too bad it wasn&#x27;t around in the 70&#x27;s....it would&#x27;ve changed my life.    Supper Satisfied Customer</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer/styler ever. don&#x27;t know why they quit selling in stores. Wish I could find a  European version to carry overseas.</li>
    <li> I HAVE AN UNRULY HEAD OF HAIR.  A LITTLE BIT OF FRIZZ EASE ON WET HAIR AND THIS BLOW DRYER.......RESULTS ARE PROFESSIONAL.  IT GETS THE DEEPEST WAVE RIGHT OUT.  ONCE DRY, STYLE WITH YOUR FAVORITE CURLING IRON.  I HAVE SINCE BEEN USING THE INSTYLER.  WITH ALL THREE PRODUCTS I FIND HEALTHIER HAIR, LESS BREAKAGE AND IT LASTS.</li>
    <li> This dryer de-frizzes my hair nicely. But what I like best is that it straightens without making my hair too pin-straight. It allows me to give it a slight curl at the ends, so it has body. The shape of the dryer allows me to curl my hair over or under. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because I wish the dryer was a little more powerful. When I&#x27;m in a hurry, I have to use my regular hair dryer to get it 3/4 done, then finish it off with the styler. I highly recommend this product. I&#x27;m buying it as a gift for several people.</li>
    <li> I bought this product becauce a friend of mine used it on my hair awhile back. It is VERY hard to find now a days so when i saw it online i had to purchase. Now i must say it is one of the best products to use if you dont feel like blowdrying then flat ironing your hair. It gives alot of body and leaves your hair straightened. I have course hair that tangles when wet. I stand behind this product 100% !</li>
    <li> The motor goes fast-slow-fast-slow when you move the dryer. If you have thick coarse hair and dont have 2 hours to dry it slowly, this isnt for you.&lt;br /&gt;Mine was broken, but even so...there is no way this would work..&lt;br /&gt;the brush part is SO HARD it hurts if you even slightly bonk your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just not a workable item for thick curly hair.</li>
    <li> This did the job of taking out the main curl and drying the hair, but I always had to go back through with a straightener to get it to look right - otherwise it was really frizzy.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about this product.  I bought my first one about 7 years ago.  Yes, I have had it that long before needing to purchase a replacement.  I have thick hair and the regular barrel dryers are broken within a month.  This dryer gives my horse hair shine and body like I never had before. I didn&#x27;t realize just how much until it finally made a horrible noise (which went on for about 6 months) and the stopped working.  I thought I would just go out and buy another one.  It never dawned on me that they would discontinue this wonderful product.  THEY DID!.  So, I am always on the lookout and between Amazon and Ebay.  I have a few backups.  If you should come across one, you really need to purchase it.  Because it is a miracle worker!!!</li>
    <li> Still working with it</li>
    <li> This product is a godsend.  I have the ability to style my hair in less than 15 minutes.  I have ethnic hair and I can&#x27;t use just any dryer to achieve a sleek hairstyle with lots of bounce.</li>
    <li> Love it but knew I would because I&#x27;ve had one before.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant at first and not sure how much difference a styler could make until i tried this one! its WOW!!!! seriously! my hair feels so soft and silky like i just got it set at a fancy salon! I have never got such results at home and would end up spending big bucks just to get my hair styled. No frizz! no dry hair! it feels great! Might sound silly but a good hair day &#x3D; good day for me. Im just glad im gonna have many many of those going forward. i totally love this styler and getting it on black friday on such a great deal was simply the icing on the cake!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have very thick and curly hair and since I&#x27;ve used this product I now have straight hair.  Very easy to use and I haven&#x27;t seen any damage to my hair.  I am very happy to own one.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this item about 6 years ago and it finally quit about a year ago, hence the need to repurchase it. This blower helps me maintain my style after my visit to the hair salon and I&#x27;m able to dry my own hair and keep it straight. This is a wonderful product and recommend it to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> I love this straightener brush, it gives my above-shoulder length hair lots of volume. Unfortunately, this particular model does not last long; this is my third in less than two years. I hope this one lasts longer.</li>
    <li> This worked great until it suddenly started blowing less air and a burning smell came from it and really irritated my lungs for a few minutes.  I have never had lung problems.  I bought a second one and the same thing happened.</li>
    <li> I am an African American with natural hair and was looking for a product that I could use to quickly dry my hair, with less damage than a blow dryer.  This product is great for that.  It is a time saver and my hair feels much better using this product than it does when I blow dry.  I think if you have a relaxer, this product will leave your hair very straight.  If your hair is natural, it does a good job too - but your hair will not be as straight.  My only issue thus far with this product is that it seems to be fragile; the teeth do bend.  So far nothing has broken and I&#x27;m hoping that will always be the case.</li>
    <li> Found this hair dryer to be effective in keeping my hair much more calmer and smooth. Other hair dryers did okay right after you dry your hair but as soon as you step outside your hair has a mind of its own. This hair dryer kept your hair looking good all day long.</li>
    <li> it seems like it could be a used item.  It makes a constant noise while in use.  It does do the job, and that I do like.  I am just afraid it won&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> This dryer fried my hair! I used it on damp hair and it took at least 20 minutes to style my hair. I have medium length hair that comes down to my shoulder. Only thing I liked about this dryer is that it gave my hair volume. As I became older, I didn&#x27;t like how flat irons make my hair look... well, flat. That is really the reason why I purchased this dryer. Maybe it won&#x27;t damage hair as much if you completely dry your hair with a regular dryer and use this dryer only for styling.</li>
    <li> The Conair Infiniti BC173 Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Wet Dry Straightening Hot Air Styler is the best hair appliance I&#x27;ve ever had.  It works like a dream.  It straightens the hair while drying.  It&#x27;s so nice not to have to blow dry &amp; then straighten with a flat iron.  It saves so much time &amp; effort.  I would recommend this appliance to anyone who wants to have straight, shiny hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this styler.  I am very fickle about hair products, but this is one that will be used every day!  My hair is smooth, soft, shiny.  It takes me 5 minutes to dry and style my hair (I have a classic bob).  Would definitely recommend to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> This product is genius! I purchased it this past weekend because of a recommendation from a friend who currently has the Conair 208 Infiniti Tourmaline Hair Designer and Dryer. She said that her current styler works great but its a bit bulky and this styler should be great to handle because it&#x27;s alot smaller. Boy was she right. I used to get cramps in my arms trying to blow dry my hair and it would always leave it puffy so I would still have to use a flat iron or curling iron. That&#x27;s not the case with this baby. It&#x27;s really a 3 in 1 one machine and cuts my styling time in half. I was a little skeptical at first because some stylers don&#x27;t work well on black hair but this really did. My hair is permed/relaxed, thick and long(a little bit past my bra strap) and this styler managed my hair with ease leaving it smooth and shiny. The hair dryer and straightening iron are hot enough to get the roots of my hair straight but I didn&#x27;t have to wince once because it didn&#x27;t burn(which can happen when you use a blow dryer and separate brush esp. if you do it in a hair salon). This means that I can go longer without touch-ups.  The ends of my hair did not come out as smooth as it usually would had I used a flat iron but I don&#x27;t mind because a flat iron usually has to be pretty hot and can sometimes leave that burned scent on my hair even if I use a protective styling cream.   I feel comfortable enough to use this styler everyday. Which is such a relief because I work up a pretty good sweat in the gym. Now I can wash my hair at home and have it nicely styled on my own in less than 30 mins. That sure beats putting it up in a boring ponytail or spending 3 hours at the hair salon:-)  I am giving these as gifts to my sisters for the holidays. It is really unbelievable.</li>
    <li> Really only works with tension which is not possible at the ends of your hair.  I would return it if I could.  Very expensive for what you get.</li>
    <li> I bought this drying straightener and was just thrilled with the way it worked, the first time.  The second time I went to turn it on, it started smoking and died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth fifty bucks!!!</li>
    <li> Sadly, I had high hopes for this little wonder, but it didn&#x27;t deliver.  It is difficult to maneuver and not powerful enough to blow out my short flippy style.</li>
    <li> I too have fine, shoulder length hair.  The short story is that the item works pretty well given that there is a tension setting (unlike traditional dryers).  Figuring in that I don&#x27;t have to hold my old hair dryer AND use a brush, I would say that this is a quality product.  In keeping with reality, nothing besides good old fashioned labor is going to give you a shiny super straight solution on the first go around.  Once the user gets a feel for the tool she can evaluate the effectiveness and ease (or not) of use.  It took me a few tries to get the feel for the process but I am now a believer.  My old hair dryer is still a keeper but if I am honest with myself it took a bit of practice to &#x27;fall in love&#x27; with that one too and I know that one day soon it&#x27;s (the old fashioned hair dryer) going to die and I&#x27;ll have to start the process (dating different models) over again. Besides, no one&#x27;s young forever, that two handed thing can and will become a chore before you know it. Bottom line...love it.</li>
    <li> Have to admit, I don&#x27;t read directions, but I did understand it was a HAIR DRYER in addition to a straightener and knew what to set the tension knob on.  But I can&#x27;t understand why I have just returned my THIRD one and this time didn&#x27;t ask for a replacement.  I was too scared!  The last two times, the blower on the hair dryer just quit and I saw an ominous glow inside the appliance....right before it FRIED itself and a little puff of smoke came out!!  I have to be doing something wrong, but what?      Anyway before that happened THREE TIMES, I had been enjoying the results--I really only bought it to tame the frizziness on top of my head, but I did like that my hair was straighter and shinier, too.  My hair is quite thick and a bit below shoulder-length.     However, I can&#x27;t risk buying another one because I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;ll catch my hair on fire or something.</li>
    <li> the product started out working well but when i got 3/4 through styling my hair, the product started to have that burning smell.  wouldn&#x27;t recommend it</li>
    <li> This item is the INFINITY DRYER / STRAIGHTENER BC173 Conair for hair.    I have not had one disappointing issue with Amazon products.  Unfortunately I ordered this item only three weeks before the second one.  The first one burned up very quickly.  I expect the second one to be better.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in January.  Used it 3.25 times.  On the fourth use it died!  While my hair did look good, it is frustrating now to figure out how to return it.</li>
    <li> My hair is curly/wavy and average thickness. I&#x27;ve worn it pretty short for most of my life, for convenience, but a few times I&#x27;ve let it grow out; I enjoy the versatility although it&#x27;s more hassle. About 8 months ago I decided to let it grow out again and, although it&#x27;s definitely at an awkward stage (just touching my shoulders and the sides aren&#x27;t quite long enough to stay behind my ears, the front keeps dropping down in my face if I don&#x27;t style it), this device is really helping.    My hair is curliest around my face and, as it grows, it starts to do this sausage-roll thing, no matter how carefully I style it with the round brush while drying it. If it&#x27;s already dry, I have to break out the hot rollers. Well, not anymore!    The only drawback for me is that it claims to be a dryer as well as a straightener, and it&#x27;s not powerful enough to dry my hair, at least not as quickly as I&#x27;d like. It&#x27;s only 700 watts (my regular dryer is 1875). So I use the 1875 to dry my hair and then I use the straightener on my hair when it&#x27;s dry.    Where it REALLY shines (sorry for the pun) is on those days when I don&#x27;t need or want to shampoo and do the whole routine. I can straighten and style VERY easily in just a couple of minutes during the morning routine, and I end up with sleeker lines than I&#x27;ve EVER gotten with the brush and dryer, plus I get the shine too! Another way it saves time is that, since it IS marketed as a dryer, it&#x27;s \\&quot;hot\\&quot; right away instead of having to wait for it to heat up (like rollers), and cools down quickly after you&#x27;ve turned it off. After literally just a couple of minutes, I go from bed-head to sleeker lines and more shine than I&#x27;d EVER get with the brush and dryer!    The heat settings (high, low, cool) are on a thumb-push switch just below the teeth of the comb, but I have to confess I haven&#x27;t figured out the different settings controlled by the knob at the top. It definitely clicks as you turn it but nothing obvious changes on the lines of the comb itself, and that knob has no labels or symbols. I did read the instructions and learned that it somehow controls the thing&#x27;s strength but I still can&#x27;t tell how. Lucky for me, I&#x27;ve got it on a good setting.    The cord is nice and long - well over 6&#x27; - and the plug has a ground fault interrupter. It&#x27;s light and the grip feels natural and balanced and doesn&#x27;t get hot, and the business end is angled just a tiny bit which feels right.    There&#x27;s no telling how many different curling irons, hot brushes, and rollers I&#x27;ve bought over the years tryingto get this kind of control and results. In addition to enjoying (and being grateful for) the time I save with it, and the improved results, now I&#x27;m really excited to have my hair longer so I can see what this thing can do with that!</li>
    <li> I love this stupid thing, this is such a great hair dryer. The handle is really big, you have to look at the instructions before reading, I know it sounds crazy but that the stupid part of it; if you don&#x27;t you&#x27;ll end up with tangled hair. I have coarse hair and I&#x27;m not sure how to use the knows at top which you do have to try each setting before you use because you will end up with a tangled mess. You have to hold it a certain way throughout the whole dry and it takes forever. I like that it has a cool setting which you will definitely need because the heat settings are extremely hot. I love the end result, shine and straight like a flat iron with volume.</li>
    <li> This is my very favorite styling tool!!!</li>
    <li> Not easy to use,disappointed</li>
    <li> Love this Infiniti Pro, love the way it leave&#x27;s my hair</li>
    <li> My hair is course &amp; thick w/ some natural curl.  I have never had any kind of styler that has made my hair so shiny and sleek.  My hair would always have a frizzed dull look before this dryer.  This dryer has replaced my hair dryer, flat iron, &amp; brush.  I only use this Hot Air Styler and a pick comb.  I can have my hair dried and styled in record time!  It has a 3 year warranty but if it broke tomorrow, I would immediately order another!</li>
    <li> Worthless piece of plastic.  Don&#x27;t bother.  I&#x27;d return if it were worth the effort.</li>
    <li> this product is good for straighting your hair after you have used the iron. it is nice and you will be happy to have it. if you do not iron ur hair first, then your hair will not be 100% straight. so think and buy. i am using and it is really nice to get your hair straightened the way you want. overall a good product.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re buying this product with the intension to use it as a dryer... well don&#x27;t do it. It&#x27;s not that powerful.    My hair is thick so I had some doubts about it, but it works great as a straightener and a styler (just don&#x27;t expect the same results as going to a hair salon). If you are not into spending a lot of time to do your hair this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Was worried when my old one broke that I would not find another one and I did!  Infiniti by Conair BC173 Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Wet Dry Straightening Hot Air Styler</li>
    <li> Love the concept but technical flaws, specifically for long hair, are a problem. My first one worked for over a year - hair was relatively short. The second one lived for about 8 months - hair was longer. This last one is already defective. I will probably purchase again because it is a one of a kind for people with less than perfect hair styling skills.</li>
    <li> This device works VERY well, wet OR dry! Much better at straightening the hair, no matter how curley.I have used ceramic plates in the past and this gets the hair looking great in less time with less damage.</li>
    <li> I puchased this product and was not happy with it at all!&lt;br /&gt;It is very sturdy and all that but after awhile using it - the handle is too heavy - which tends to put a strain on your wrist - i have long hair, straight hair and feel it for those who have this product and have curly, long hair - take it from me - if you insist of purchasing this product - get a wrist guard - cause after awhile you will feel the &#x27;burn&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps... I can surely say - i wasted my $$$$&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. i would like to add - it last only 1 yr - used only 7 times out of that one year..</li>
    <li> I have very thick cirly hair. I ussually don&#x27;t have time in thr moring to do a great job straightening my hair. My hair dresser takes about 30 min. but it looks great. With this product I can do my own hair as good as the salon and it only takes about 15 min. I use my regular hair dryer and dry it about 1/2 way, then I finish with this styler. Because the brush is built into the dryer I have one hand free to section my hair. It is great! I was worried about it not being pwerful enough for my thick hair but It is more than powerful enough. The tension control is great, I set mine on 4 because I have thick hair. Bottom line, I would recomend this product to anyone that hates to straighten there hair with a brush and a dryer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of heat brushes and stuff to tame my mane....and this one seems to work pretty well! It is comfortable to hold, easy to use, and it seems to get the job done. My hair is medium long, and has the tendency to be frizzy, and this thing kept it together. The downside is that it does get really hot if you have a stubborn spot and hold it there too long, and it is not going to be good for really long or really curly hair. Overall I am happy with this so far....</li>
    <li> It makes my hair soft after using it but I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s that straight.  I would rather use the John Frieda hot brush I just purchased.  I feel like even after using this I have to use my hair straightener.  I don&#x27;t think this replaces any product but when used with my blow dryer and my straightener it seems that my hair is straighter and softer.</li>
    <li> I have been using this dryer for years. I keep one at work, one in a suitcase for travel and one in my dressing room. My hair is thick and wavy and hard to dry.  I love them and it is the only hair dryer I use.</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking it was the perfect answer for my shoulder length slightly wavy fine hair, to give me a sleek styled look. Wrong! I tried numerous times to use this \\&quot;styler\\&quot; and found it awkward and useless at best. At worst, I felt like I was damaging my hair! I even took it to my hair stylist to see if there was some technique I needed to use for better results. She was baffled by the poor design of this product as well. My advice? Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I was in need of a new hair dryer. Did some research and discovered this was the best product for the money. Bought it on Amazon, as they had the best price. I used the product according to the directions, and my hair looked good. It was easy to use. After a few days I &#x27;did my own thing&#x27; ad my hair looked great, just like I stepped out of the salon.</li>
    <li> Love the styler!  Takes me only 5 minutes to get the curl I need.  Good buy.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome for curly hair to dry straight, but left with some bounce and slight curl.  This is the second one that I have purchased, the first was over 3 years ago.  Using it daily.  That is a pretty good return.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every product you can think of. Of all of them, this is the best! It defrizzes and shines your hair. I use it everyday whether I wash my hair or not. You do need to towel dry your hair good. Put product if you like and then just style. Easy to use with great results!</li>
    <li> Well it looks like everyone has discovered this hair dryer. I have bought at least 4 already because I think its so great I buy them for friends and family. I would have bought another today, however the last one i bought was $24, and now they are almost $50. Is it worth it? Sure. But I&#x27;m still gonna wait until the price goes back down.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this item at Target (paid $49.99) and I love it!  I have short, fine hair, growing out into a chin length bob and although it doesn&#x27;t work the conventional way (brushing out underneath), I can use it similar to a regular hairbrush and it straightens and sleeks my hair.  I was afraid a straightener would make my hair flat but this gives me volume and the shine is unbelievable.  My usual round of shine serums and smoothing cremes are totally unnecessary now.  This was my first straightening styler and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it!</li>
    <li> I bought this item at Target for the same price as Amazon. (I thought Amazon would have a better price.)  When I tried it out, it worked like other brush hair dryers that I have used in the past.  It did well in curling and flipping out the ends of my hair, but in terms of straightening, it did a so-so job, my hair was still a little frizzy.  A flat iron did a better job with straightening.  I am going to return it.</li>
    <li> I have thick and very curly hair. I usually have to dry my hair and then straighten it. This fantastic dryer does both steps. Perfect. Big time saver and less damage to the hair. Also, made my hair really shine! Love this prodeuct.</li>
    <li> I bought this hotbrush with the hopes that it would shorten the time it takes to dry my hair straight. Well it does do that but you are left with a frizzy mess if your hair is naturally curly.  The results are like using your hairdryer with a wide toothed comb and you still have to use your flat iron to smooth and straighten it out.  All in all this product is definately not worth the money.  Keep your blow dryer and round brush and save yourself $50.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a defective unit or if they are all this way.  But assuming they are all this way, they are completely unsafe.  I bought mine on a Friday, used it on Saturday, and returned it on Monday.  I am not joking, I am seriously suprised that it didn&#x27;t set my hair on fire.  My single setting flat iron doesn&#x27;t even make my hair that hot.  Have you ever taken a pair of jeans out of the dryer and have the metal button burn you?  Yep, that&#x27;s what it did to my hair.  I ran my fingers through my hair after passing the hot air styler through it and burned my fingers.  I changed it to the low setting but with the same scorching results.  On top of that, the low power 700 watt motor ensures that you have to torture your hair with this temperature about 10 minutes longer than you would with a normal higher powered 1600 watt hair dryer.  The end result was some seriously frizzed out hair with enough static buildup to jump start a car that required a double dose of glossing wax to tame and that&#x27;s even after using a frizz control and silk drops in my wet hair.  Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t buy this thing.  Save your time, money, and hair.</li>
    <li> I like it!  I haven&#x27;t used it on damp/wet hair, but I must say that it calms and straightens those bad hair day frizzies extremely well.  The tool is easy to use and my hair was very shiny and healthy.  It does take some practice, like any other blow dryer or styling tool would require.  I do like it and would recommended it.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this straightener after several attemps to find a good one i finally fund one.I have realy thick and curly hair and it straighten my hair in less then half the time it used to.I highly recomend this item.</li>
    <li> Basically the commercial for this item sold me.  It looked so great and easy to operate.  It was totally different when I tried it.  Maybe it just doesn&#x27;t work with my short layered hairstyle.  I feel it is awkward working with it in one hand also.  Maybe I need to give it more of a chance but right now I&#x27;m not happy with the item.</li>
    <li> The dryer worked fine but I only use a hair dryer occasionally so I&#x27;d only used it twice in 6 weeks.  When I went to use it the third time, it was deader than a doornail.  No power.  I guess the stress of sitting in the cabinet for a few weeks was too much for it.  Too late to return it.  I&#x27;ve seen other reviews with a similar problem so it seems they have some quality control issues to work out and if you buy one, it&#x27;s the luck of the draw if you get a &#x27;good&#x27; one or not.  I&#x27;m generally very pleased with my purchases through Amazon...but this one was a dud.</li>
    <li> I have chin length frizzy hair that I do battle with on a daily basis with upkeep involving an expensive blow dryer, flat iron, and sometimes curling iron.  On my first stying attempt with this product, my hair came out straight with body, something difficult to achieve previously.  Styling time was less and the results much better.  I have tried so my appliances that I was definitely skeptical, but my experience was an unexpected surprise.</li>
    <li> My dealings with Nicholas at Foward Motion has been more than exceptional.  The item purchase was not exactly what I imagined, but Nicholas worked with me in finding a product that met my needs. I commend his services and patience in working to resolve the needs of a customer.      Respecfully,  Yolanda</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping that I could get rid of my flat iron, but this is nothing more than a hair dryer with a comb attachment turned sideways. The tension settings either pulled my hair too much or didn&#x27;t put it at all. My hair looked just the same as it would have if I had used my hair dryer and a comb attachment. Save yourself some money and buy a $5 comb attachment to put on your hair dryer. I have AA relaxed hair.</li>
    <li> if anyone wants an easy to use hair styler this is the one I recommend.You just have to follow the simple instructions,always use the cool down button for a few minutes .My hair hair came out looking better than I expected,with hardly any effort.It would be great for teens just starting on their own with styling.</li>
    <li> I am very skeptical when it comes to products like this because they don&#x27;t ever seem to do as promised. But, I have been using this styler for several months now and don&#x27;t have one complaint so far. I have very thick hair with some wave to it. Previously, I would use a blow dryer and flat iron (which took forever) and would end up with big frizzy hair and it still had the wave. I have found that it&#x27;s best to let your hair air dry a little and use anti-frizz cream before using the styler, but I definitely recommend it to all you girls with thick, hard to straighen hair!!</li>
    <li> I just got mine today.  my hair is really thick, it is also very frizzy b/c of damage.  it completely dried my hair, tammed friz &amp; straightend my hair.  it didnt make it lay flat on my head like a straigtener does.  it made my hair shine really pretty.  it dosent make my hair bone straight it makes it have just the right amount of volume.  &amp;&amp; it usually take me 45 minutes or so to do my hair.  with this i was done in less than 10 minutes.  i luv it!!!</li>
    <li> It performed much better than I expected. It actually straightened my unrelaxed, African-American hair and it did it much quicker and better than a blow-dryer and brush. My hair isn&#x27;t even jaw length yet it managed to do very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t follow the instructions on how to use the dryer regarding sectioning.  I used it like a regular brush and as I said, I am thrilled!</li>
    <li> In a nutshell, not enough wattage to get the job done in a reasonable amount of time.  I&#x27;d also appreciate a shorter cord.  I love the idea of this device, the straightening element works well for me.  My hair is coarse and very wavy, always frizzy unless I straighten, so I really wanted to like this product.  My friend who has finer, thinner hair than mine loves it.  However, the 700 watt power makes styling take forever.  I may as well dry and then iron, since it would be faster.  Still, I&#x27;ll probably keep this for travel, since it&#x27;s very portable.</li>
    <li> I just tried it for the first time . I purchased it from Ebay for less than 30. including shipping. At first the tension setting tip confused me but I finally settled on using number 4, with the view of the number 4 being from the front. You will probably have to experiment with the numbers. I don&#x27;t like to use high heat so I used low which took a little longer , but not too bad. My hair is fairly straight except for a big S like wave in the back and a cowlick at my side parted bangs. It tends to frizz underneath. It is shoulder lenght with long layers, fine hair but quite a bit of it. I sectioned it and dryed it from underneath for the most part then at the end I switched to the top section of the hair. When I got to the crown I pulled the hair forward when I started drying it and that gave it a little volume. I did my entire head then I switched to the cool setting and went back over it quickly.I did use a heat protectant spray when it was damp, right before I started using the tool. My hair is very dry and I only wash it twice a week. I hope it will stay nice and look good in the morning , enabling me to do my hair before work with minimal effort. We shall see. I am terrible with a brush and blow dryer. I did much better with this. I like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a clutz, and can&#x27;t handle a blow dryer in one hand and a brush in the other, so this solves the problem... its actually the second one I&#x27;ve bought</li>
    <li> Just received it, plugged it in after watching DVD and reading instructions but it would not go on; tried reset button etc. with no luck. Will have to send it back. I have purchased other Conair products over the years but this was a big disappointmnet because I didn&#x27;t get a chance to use it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! Can only get it online!</li>
    <li> I can never be without this product... Easy handle and awesome hair finish results. I would recommend to all hair types.</li>
    <li> My most favorite hair styler.It really works well on my shoulder length hair,fast and easy.I got one for my sister as a gift and she loves it too.Definitely would buy it again</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product for my mother who suffers from chronic hand pain and limited mobility due to several unsuccessful surgeries to repair an injury.  She has raved to me that it styles her hair better than any dryer she has utilized in the past and is extremely easy to operate, even in her deteriorated state.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who has difficulty handling both a dryer and a brush simultaneously, whether due to a chronic condition or simply a lack of dexterity.</li>
    <li> I have very fine curly hair and rushed out to buy this product hoping it would be the end of broken hair resulting from when I use a flat iron.  IT BROKE AFTER ONE USE.  Does not straighten hair, just dries it a little less curly.  It also took a long time.  Upon trying to use it a second time, it started making a strange noise and had smoke coming from it.      I wouldn&#x27;t waste your time - don&#x27;t buy.  Or if you&#x27;ve bought, keep the box and registration and RETURN.  I am seriously disappointed in the quality of this product from Conair.</li>
    <li> PIECE OF JUNK!!  This hair dryer burned out after 2 uses.  My return period ended a couple of weeks ago, so now I have to pay for shipping to Conair to get a replacement.  Hopefully the replacement will work more than twice.  Very disappointed!!</li>
    <li> This is my second Wet/Dry Hot Air Styler. I used the first one until there was no life left in it, lol. Glad I found this. This Conair styler is hard to find now.</li>
    <li> I have used this dryer for years.  I have fine hair and lots of it.  My hair is wavy/curly on the back of my head and this dryer/styler not only dries it but also gets it straight for me. I have bought two other dryers recently and neither one could compare to this one.  I thought Conair had discontinued this dryer/styler but I have still been searching for it as the last one I had quit working.  When I search and found this one I was very, very happy.  I hope Conair will continue making this one........it is a winner in my book!!!</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer.  It is easy to use, lightweight, and it helps straighten my wavy hair with minimum effort.  The best part is that you can use it with your hair slightly damp.</li>
    <li> This is my third Infiniti Pro brush styler  can&amp;#34;t do without it!  Do not need a hair dryer and brush as tis is all in one!</li>
    <li> I purchased this at Ulta after reading reviews from various sources online, and figured it would be easy enough to return if it didn&#x27;t work.I have used it for a week so far, and love it.    My hair is caucasian, naturally curly (corkscrews and cowlicks), and bleached from medium brown to blond so is fairly course. The style I currently have is an inverted bob- at the nape of my neck in the back and graduates to about 3&#x27;&#x27; below my chin in the front. There is some moderate layering in the back. It takes about 15 min to style my hair with this.     I have seen a few reviews stating that it does not work for them, but I think either their hair is a much coarser and tighter curl than mine, or they are not using a proper technique.    A few things to keep in mind- do not overwhelm your hair with product, it is not necessary with this and makes it diffucult to get the comb thru. Pick one good humidity resistant straightening paste and you should be good.     Also, section your hair off into 1.5 - 2 inch wide sections with small clips. Start sectioning in the front and work your way to the back, then start drying in the reverse order. Sectioning is imperative or you will just pull random strands in which will be a frizzy mess.    It helps if you pull the strand taut with one hand, and hold the comb in place for a few seconds as you work your way down the strand. Then repeat on the other side of the strand. Finish combing through with the cold setting to get a nice smooth and frizz-free shine.    At first I needed to finish with my flat iron until I learned what works best. I no longer need it.     My only criticism is that this brush could be improved with more speed settings. I have a feeling that for hair longer than mine, it would be faster to use a regular blowdryer and large roundbrush. The brush design makes it so much easier to maneuver than the pistol style infiniti straightener . That particular dryer is wonderful for the front, but is terribly awkward at the backof the head due to how it has to be held. If the brush style had ranged up to 1500 watts it would be suitable for both short and long hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I didnot thought it would have been so good. I always had to be going to the hairdresser to get the type of look I wanted for my hair. This hairdryer along with the flat iron does wonders for the straighten look i always love. The blowdryer is easy to use and handle the built in comb makes it a breeze. And because of the structure and material of the product i dont have to worry about the comb breaking. My sister uses it on her processed hair and it works! My friend also used it on her thick natural african american hair worked too!! And on my indian hair it works perfectly!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review before but I had to about this product. I was skeptical at first. Could this one machine dry and straighten hair while making it look good? The anwser is yes!!    I am a complete klutz when it comes to my hair. I was able to do my shoulder length, thick hair in 20 minutes.    I wash my hair every other day and when I style it always looks frizzy on the ends. The next morning after I&#x27;ll wake up with serious bed head. So I have to blow dry again and really pull my hair(damaging).When I woke up this morning all I had to do was run a brush through my hair and go!     Please keep in mind that the cons referred to here aren&#x27;t cons, just reality:    Noise-This is a dryer and iron.    Easy of use-Of course it isn&#x27;t as easy as the commercial! Your effort involves sectioning hair off. Isn&#x27;t that what you do anyway to dry/iron?    If you get your hair blown out at the salon get this instead and try it just one time. It&#x27;ll be worth it!</li>
    <li> A little to hot for me but I still use it.  Pulls my hair a little also.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer/styler. It is pretty easy to use although I am still learning different techniques. I am 55 yrs old and have never found a hairstyling tool that I like as much as this one.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $$. Nothing that the ads claim about this thing worked for me. It simply does not make your hair look even close to as smooth and pretty as the infomercial, nor is it easy to use as they show it. An overpriced piece of junk, and a total disappointment!</li>
    <li> Bought this hot air brush six months ago because I could not locate another WIGO ion hot air brush at any of my local stores.  Seriously regret the purchase as it was a total waste of money.  Brush only worked for six months - 5 minutes per day, with one user - before it died.  No warning, just would not start one day and it went in the garbage.  Highly recommend the WIGO and have purchased another one to replace this Conair that was not worth the price.</li>
    <li> I ordered it, thinking it was something else, and then when it arrived, I was intrigued and had to try it.  Okay, it will straighten but not certain the point of it. I can&#x27;t use it to curl the ends and it seems a flat iron would do a better job.  I used it once, didn&#x27;t like it. Tried it the second time to see if I just wasn&#x27;t using it right, and still wasn&#x27;t thrilled. It is now in my dead heap pile of unused hair gadgets.</li>
    <li> I have thin, limp hair that is very prone to damage/split ends. I never straightened my hair, and if I did, I would wait for it to air-dry first. I NEVER used hair dryers because they  always made my hair really dry, dull, and frizzy. My problem with straightening my hair was that it would be flat as a pancake on my head after i straightened it. I couldn&#x27;t win; I had to choose between volume and frizziness/dullness, or straight and shiny but flat. Time was also an issue. I have no patience for styling my hair, so this process got old. I resorted to wearing my hair up every single day.    This product is fantastic for my hair type-thin, lifeless, prone to damage. I would definitely reccomend it to anyone with my hair type and lack of patience. It only takes me about 20 minutes to use, whereas before, I would wait about 30 min. for my hair to air-dry then take another 30 min to straighten it. This product also makes my hair really smooth and shiny, and also adds volume. I wouldnt necessarily recomend this product for girls with really long curly hair, only because those girls may not like the extra volume.    Just to let you know, I used Organix Vanilla silk blow-dry creme in conjunction with this product, and it is also fantastic. I reccomend this product as well.    I hope this helps!!</li>
    <li> it really hard to use this product unless you are an stailist. Also it take time to straighten the hair and at the end is frizzy. I&#x27;m very dissapointed and it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer works real well if you have use of 1 arm. I like it well and how my hair looks after.</li>
    <li> The Infiniti by Conair BC173 gives me great results.  If you are trying to obtain silky straight hair, I highly recommend this item.  I own a Chi hair straightener, but the Infiniti does such a great job that I don&#x27;t even really need to use the Chi.  As an option, however, I sometimes use the Chi after drying my hair with the Infiniti so that I can achieve a little more smoothness.  However, the Infiniti enables me to have the control I seek without using the Chi.  The Infinity allows a professional straight hairstyle that&#x27;s easy to achieve.  I&#x27;m most delighted to find and own the Infinity and highly recommend it.  It also seems very good quality to me.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and I don&#x27;t like it. This is the only dryer/styler that I can use. I am on my third one. I took it overseas and I think that I burned it up so I had to get another one. It is indispensable to me. It&#x27;s light weight and easy to use. I use it on dry hair every day as well as drying my hair when I wash it.</li>
    <li> I had one of these for 8 years and it finally broke. I was so happy to find it is still sold! Great for my fine hair- gives it lots of volume and shine. Quick drying and styling. Here&#x27;s to another 8 years!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to get the hang of the styler to get a nice sleek hairstyle in the short time I used it.  I won&#x27;t continue to try to use it because it is blows too hot.  It was too hot for me to use my free hand to section and lift to use the styler.  I came close to burning my hand several times.  It&#x27;s nice that it works for so many people.  Wish it did for me as well.  Unfortunately, I&#x27;m going to return it.</li>
    <li> I was so pleased that Conair is offering this hot air styler again.  I had this for years and it finally stopped working.  When I went on the Conair website it was no longer available.  I also checked Amazon only to find that it was no longer on their website.  Then a couple of months later lo and behold it was being offered again.  I am very pleased!!!</li>
    <li> I have had one of these for many years.  I was unable to find another one until recently and was terrified mine would die before I found one.  It makes all the difference in how my hair looks.</li>
    <li> To dry my shoulder length hair, I simply spray on a conditioner/detangler then &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; it dry with this styler. Usually, I use the high setting on sections of my hair until it is mostly dry. Then I finish on the cool setting. I get shiny, nearly frizz-free results each time.</li>
    <li> A friend of ours recommended this and I&#x27;ve never been happier. I don&#x27;t even have to straighten my hair after blow drying with this. It works perfectly so far.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is discontinued, I have been looking everywhere to buy one since the one I had seen better days. It is perfect for short hair, I don&#x27;t even have to use flat iron anymore, I would definitely recommend this, it&#x27;s light and quick, but I do have fine hair, I guess it would take a bit longer to dry if you have thick hair.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled that the Infiniti Pro by Conair is back on the market!  I bought 3 as soon as I saw that they were available.  Living in FL and having curly hair has been quite a challenge, but the Infiniti Pro is a lifesaver!  It dries my hair in much less time than other dryers and I can either wear as is after drying it or continue with a flat iron.  Thank you for bringing back my miracle dryer!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this Conair dryer/styler so much I just ordered a second one to put in the camper.  My hair, which left to air dry is curly and frizzy, looks great after drying it with this styler.  Now it doesn&#x27;t make my hair perfectly smooth and straight like I would get with a straightener.  I guess you could say it&#x27;s somewhat smooth with some body. It is so fast and easy to dry my hair this way and I am very pleased with the results.  If I wake up in the morning and have some flyaway hair that aren&#x27;t behaving, I just spend about 2 minutes to run the Conair dryer/styler though it and I am off and on my way.  Now if I want very straight, smooth hair, I use my Instyler rotating hot iron.  But if I don&#x27;t want to spend that kind of time (which is most of the time), I use this and it&#x27;s fairly smooth with no frizzies or curls.</li>
    <li> I have used thishair dryer for over 5 years.  I love this dryer.  I don&#x27;t think I could dry my curly course hair without this dryer.</li>
    <li> i had it one and lasted several years and i was please with the performant so i wanted to replaced it</li>
    <li> I have used other hair styling tools so I am not totally inept with them, but this tool was a real failure on my hair.  My hair is fine and straight and I wanted a little curve to it  (achievable with other hot brushes).  All it did was to frizz my (usually) non frizzy hair.  The strands do not wrap tightly around the cylinder and this causes fly away hair.  For anyone with my type of hair, I wd strongly advise against this tool.</li>
    <li> this item was just like a blow dryer but takes alot longer. yes it straightened my hair but no it wasnt quick or easy. I know that a flat iron damages your hair but i rather do that than take an hour and a half styling. however i do give this product kudos for not damaging. what can i say i didnt pay for the expensive option. Like i said you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I bought the Infinity at Shopko.  I have thick, naturally curly hair and it straightened out the curl and made my hair sleek, not frizzy. I was very pleased with it. Unfortunately, it started losing power after only about 8 or 9 months then it died.  I wrote to the company and they sent me another one for free.  This one only lasted about 5 months!  As you can guess, I didn&#x27;t bother with buying another.  I am still looking for one that will last longer...any suggestions??</li>
    <li> I have really thick shoulder length hair. I only wash my hair twice a week and once my hair is dry and straightened, I don&#x27;t need to do a thing with it. This product works really well for me as long as I have the time to spare. I takes me at least 30 or 40 minutes to dry and straighten my hair once it has been towel dried. I bought this product because I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money for more expensive similar items. I think that for the price....the infiniti is well worth it.</li>
    <li> The Connair *Infinity Pro Hot air brush did not work for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;Worst yet this merchant - D[...]- would not let me return it.&lt;br /&gt;The merchant had not stated that the product was not returnable.&lt;br /&gt;This brush would not work at all for curly hair.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping for a dryer that would get rid of some of the frizz and curls I started getting when I turned 30 - an unexpected and unwelcome byproduct of aging.  This seemed perfect, but the dryer is so weak, it takes forever to dry my hair and virtually no straightening effect.  After using it, I still have to straighten my hair with a flat iron.  So I&#x27;ve gone back to drying my hair with a regular dryer (more power and therefore faster) and using the flat iron.  I guess I should have known it sounded too good to be true.</li>
    <li> This is the best blow dryer/straightener I have ever had. This is my second one, I had to have another one after my first one played out. I may order a spare just to have</li>
    <li> I love this item, I can wash my hair and let it air dry. 5 minutes before I leave I use this with a brush, it&#x27;s straight and frizz free. I have shoulder length thin curly hair that frizzes on the mere thought of humidity. I do use argon oil when hair is wet.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter whom has bi-racial mixed hair to alleviate her having to use the brush and blow dryer to use one tool.  So far this has worked wonders, she has as much hair as Mariah Carey (natural) or Diana Ross.  The blow dryer did a good job of keeping her hair straight while blow drying and did not get tangled or caught in the drying mechanism.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I really like the cool feature. I have naturally curly hair and do not apply heat. I was able to straighten my hair (just enough) so that I could get the desired style. This product was very easy to maneuver while drying my hair as well. It did not pull</li>
    <li> I have used the Conair Wet / Dry Hot Air Styler for years.  They add body and height to my hairstyle that I just can&#x27;t get any other way.  This is my 4th styler over approximately 7 years.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, curly hair, and this dries and straightens my hair in about 15 minutes.  Thinking about buying a second one to have on hand in case this one breaks.</li>
    <li> I finally found a product that it simple to use and really works for my short, very thick, curly hair.  It makes it smooth and manageable.   I am not a handy or patient person, so if I am happy with this product, it means it is really good!</li>
    <li> I love what this does with my hair.  I&#x27;m in my 30s and don&#x27;t want my hair completely flat ironed like a teen, but want it slick with the frizzies tamed.  This does the job and my hair is thick and curly.  However, after about four months it started overheating and stopped blowing much air.  Now it&#x27;s been six months and it finally died completely.  So get it -- but get a warranty!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant at first to buy this product because i read some not-so-good reviews about it, but i was glad i took the risk because this one is AWESOME. It makes u save time of blow drying and straightening your hair..it does it all. I just love it. This is highly recommended. And for the price, its totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Is the  only Straightener which leaves my hair smooth, with volume and style. I bought one  5 years ago. I love it!! I was surprise how difficult it was to find this product, so I bought two.Just can&#x27;t live without!!</li>
    <li> I bought a spare because I&#x27;m afraid my old one, that has lasted for years, will soon wear out. I have coarse hair that has a bend. The Infiniti Pro dries my hair straight. I never thought I could wear straight styles until I found this product. It dries my heavy hair fast. Sometimes I use my flat iron with it. Most of the time I don&#x27;t need to.</li>
    <li> I started drying my hair, the &amp;#34;Styler&amp;#34; overheated, started smelling funny, and died. I was able to turn it up ever gain. Now I have to figure out how to return it.</li>
    <li> I have very thick and curly hair this hair dryer  straighten my hair  I love it .</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair tool! I have fine hair and it works really good.when is almost dry I start brushing and it takes like 6 min done !</li>
    <li> BEST HAIR DRYER EVER FOR STRAIGHTENING EXTREMELY CURLY ETHNIC HAIR.  HOLDS UP WELL OVER TIME,  I HAVE BEEN USING MY PREVIOUS ONE SINCE 2008, STILL GOING STRONG BUT I WANTED A REPLACEMENT IN CASE IT BROKE.  I WOULD BE LOST WITHOUT IT AND FOR A WHILE I GUESS CONAIR STOPPED MAKING IT.  KUDDOS TO AMAZON FOR FINDING MORE TO SELL.......</li>
    <li> Loved it! Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Great product, shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition.  This is a professional, well built hair dry, with a good high heat setting. Would recommend for anyone looking for a long lasting well built hair drying/styler.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with unmanagable frizzy hair all my life.  The past few  years I resorted to having my hair blown out twice a week at the salon....very $$$$. I now dry my hair a bit with a regular blow dryer then use the BC173...I use my left hand to separate my hair and help guide it into the dryer....it defrizzes and straightens my hair leaving it with body (flat irons leave my hair straw like and too straight and unnatural)..I turn the knob at the top to #1 for the greatest tension.....sounds a bit dramatic but the BC173 has changed my life....  Thank you Conair! (I have bought several because I&#x27;m scared they will discontinue this model one day)</li>
    <li> While the thing worked just as good as a flat iron in half the time I went through 4 of these, in a little over a year. They All died within 3-5 months of each other. I called the company and gotten replacement for my first one and and was given a 6-10 week wait, so I buckled and bought another one...which died before they even sent me my replacement which was taking way longer then 10 weeks, when i called again asking where my replacement was, the guy we talked to said there was no reason i should have even had that wait and that he&#x27;d make sure he sent a replacement for both dryers, and that they&#x27;d arrive in a timely manner. Which they did. Both replacements are dead. I switched back to my  flat iron, which cost the same as one of those stupid driers but has lasted at least 4 years and still works like day 1.</li>
    <li> Got 5 of these so far as gifts and used one myself love the antifrizz  Tourmaline comb it straightens and styles hair with no effort just comb through the direction you want your hair styled  I  bring it with me everywhere I travel it is compact enough for the carryon</li>
    <li> My favorite hair dryer!  I was heart broken when my first one died on me after having it for several years and I couldn&#x27;t locate a replacement. Imagine how happy I was when I did. This is a great product and I should have ordered 10 ;)</li>
    <li> My sister was about to braid my hair at her place one weekend but before she could I needed to wash and dry my hair right quick. Well, I searched high and low in her home and I couldn&#x27;t find a hairdryer.. I checked her bedroom as a last resort and found a hairdryer that looked like a brush (Hair Designer Conair BC173). I took one look at it my first thought was \\&quot;damn, not another styling brush... these don&#x27;t work and they rip my  hair out\\&quot;; when I looked at the brush a second time I realized that it was actually a hair dryer so I decided why not try it and see what happens. OMG.... this revolutionary piece of equipment not only dryed my hair perfectly it straightened it a bit in the process. I was shocked speechless. I find that holding this hair dryer doesn&#x27;t feel as awkward or cumbersome as with other hair dryers. I&#x27;m sold for life on this. When I read that some people didn&#x27;t like it or rated it low I was surprised; they  must not have been using it correctly. I&#x27;m glad that the majority of the reviews were positive because this really is an awesome hairdryer. I can&#x27;t imagine ever going back. Finally a hairdryer for black women or women with coarse hair.</li>
    <li> If you have short hair (say, up to 10&amp;#34; long), this thing is awesome.  It combs and dries at the same time, but makes controlling waves much easier.  I&#x27;ve used mine for over 2 months and think it is far better than a blow drier and far better for your hair.</li>
    <li> I did not like this at all. I returned it. It made my hair frizzy. I have just-past-my-shoulders-length average thickness, fairly wavy hair. I was looking for a one-piece solution to my hair dryer-plus-round brush routine. This was not the solution. It&#x27;s faster and easier to section my hair and use the dryer + brush. Oh, well.</li>
    <li> this is a great product.  dries and styles hair at the same time.  sometimes I use it before further styling with a straightener or curling iron, but can be used alone.</li>
    <li> I had this hair dryer before and it died on me. It was due for a new one, I wanted to look for one like the one I had. This is what I found! Love it. Easy since I am not good with hairdryer and brushing at the same time.</li>
    <li> Exactly as ordered. It was a surprise for the wife so I wasn&#x27;t sure about it. She loves it and it worked great.</li>
    <li> So far good. Very easy to use. Gets my daughters mixed hair safely straight. Her hair is relaxed and she is able to dry and straighten after shampooing in less than half the time. She no longer flat irons for that straight look and we don&#x27;t get any burnt hair smell that she used to get when she professionally got it blow dried and flat ironed. Plus it&#x27;s a lot cheaper and safer to avoid all that extra heat.</li>
    <li> Love it.  My first one broke after I had it for 5 years.  So glad I found it at Amazon.  It&#x27;s the only blow dryer the get my family hair straight</li>
    <li> Worked ok for awhile but suddenly died. It&#x27;s okay with thick hair but I suggest getting the instlyler instead.</li>
    <li> Best styler I have ever used and believe me I have tried many!  I am on my third one and plan to keep on using! Dries and styles at same time</li>
    <li> My hair is about 90% straight and 10% wavy, so you wouldn&#x27;t think it takes much to make it sleek, straight and shiny; I even use an ant-firzz serum before I style. But using this Conair took twice as long as drying and straightening my hair in two steps, and gave me half as straight hair. I even used my regular blow dryer first to get most of the dampness out, thinking this would speed up the process...but no, it took ages. The Conair is basically a very small hairdryer with a few brush bristles. When I was finished, my hair definitely had frizz and fly aways, and I had to go back over it with my Chi flat iron. I really wanted to like this product and to save time, but I will be returning it.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work as well as my own hair drier and brush. It certainly didn&#x27;t dry my thick hair nor did it straighten or smooth it. It took an hour to do what I do with my usual method in twenty minutes, and my hair did not look good at all. Another item to take us drawer space . . .</li>
    <li> I am extremely excited about this great quality hair straightened and dyer combo. I have very curly hair and this dryer Works like magic to straighten hair without oil!!!</li>
    <li> This purchase was to replace an old identical model I&#x27;ve used for years, so of course I like it a lot. I was a bit concerned whether this was a new item when I made the purchase. Thankfully, it arrived sealed in a Conair box, and certainly appears to be new. I&#x27;m very satisfied with the item and service. It was very nice to still be able to find this item for sale.</li>
    <li> This product is money going to the trash. I used it once and it doesn&#x27;t do ANYTHING. It can hardly grasp the hair and can&#x27;t really streighten anything. Simply doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
    <li> Oh my god i love my infinity seriously i can have my hair straighten in 5 min...i just love it.</li>
    <li> Wife wanted to try something new to keep her hair straight. I saw the reviews here and for the price it sounded good. My wife used it twice on two opposite settings and both times all it did was make her hair frizz.  I called the company to make a complaint and all they would do is say I can pay to ship it back and include a check for $7 for return shipping and they will repair or replace it with the same model. I said it will cost me about $20 back and forth shipping for something I paid $26 for and you are not up grading me. I told them that I will be reviewing there product and I will never again purchase another Conair product. They did not care. I was shocked that a company that big with the times as they are would rather get a negative review and lose a customer than just replace it at NC for an upgrade.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I ever bought. The first I blew out after 2 years but it was really great. Dried and straightened/flipped my hair without the damage of blow drying THEN straightening. Gives more volume too. very good product and came in the mail really fast!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for years and when it finally died I bought another! Truly a go to hair styler. Make sure you use heat protection and you&#x27;re all set. I have very long, thick hair and I use Argan Oil from Josie Moran. I do use a flat iron afterwards just to smooth out the rough edges, but this cuts the time in half!</li>
    <li> I love it. First time I tried this dryer was when my friend used hers while doing my hair. I instantly fell in love. It works wonderfully all over from just drying after a wash to stretching out my tight coils for straightening. Best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned hands down.</li>
    <li> This is my second conair wet/ dry blow dryer. I love this tool! Gives my hair a smooth professional style in minutes..</li>
    <li> PROS: This is my second unit. It&#x27;s a unique product and I encourage Conair to keep producing it. Great for mid-length hair. Cannot achieve the same results with other styling tools.&lt;br /&gt;CONS: I don&#x27;t know if this is a refurbished unit. First one lasted 5 years with daily use. Within the first week of using this one, the motor suddenly slowed and I thought it was going to shut down, but it only happened once and unit is working as intended since. Not sure how it will hold up over time.</li>
    <li> the best tool to make it easy to look your hair fantastic every day</li>
    <li> This works great on short or long hair. I really like it more than curling irons and other hair stylers.</li>
    <li> excellent product and seller very responsible</li>
    <li> Heats not at peak but it works</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this air styler.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd one and I love it. These are perfect if you travel.&lt;br /&gt; I don&#x27;t have time to dry my hair and then use another tool to style it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;I just had my old one stop working, so decided I&#x27;d buy another since the company is not making these anymore.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase. I first bought my first one 4-5 years ago. The reason why I am buying a new one is because the first one is beginning to make a metal rattling noise. I don&#x27;t want to take the risk of causing an electrical fire or burning my hair. For safety reasons, I decided to buy a new one today. I used the #%$%$ out of the first one. This is truly an amazing item for natural un-relaxed 4c hair. There is a right way and a wrong way to use this product. Sectioning, detangling and using a good quality heat protectant is key. The results are smooth, soft and straight manageable hair. Applying a flat iron after isn&#x27;t really needed, unless you want bone straight, just left the salon, relaxer results. Since I started to hear the metal rattling in my first Wet/ Dry Styler last night while blow drying, I was forced to finish my hair using my Conair BlueBird dryer, to which it left my hair hard and extremely dry, even after applying a heat protectant and moisture and sealing my hair. For those of you who have 4c or 4c like texture, I highly recommend this product. The only thing I can really suggest is that you read the instruction carefully and follow the directions.</li>
    <li> I was actually doing a search for the InStyler when I came across this item. I wasn&#x27;t sold on spending the $100+ dollars yet for an item that has received so-so reviews. When I clicked on the the item and saw the reviews I was like, whats the loss... it&#x27;s only $25. I received it today, and my hair was in need of a washing anyway... so...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an African American female so my hair is less than easy to deal with (plus it&#x27;s short). Especially when I have to manuever a blow dryer in it. Usually my arm is killing me from doing the back of my head with a blowdryer and brush. This device was so easy. And when I was done my hair wasn&#x27;t left looking like I came out of the 70s with an afro like it usually looks like after I wash and blow dry it. I still needed to use a flat iron, but it was just so much easier. Hair wasn&#x27;t going every which way, it didn&#x27;t feel dried out from the heat. And my arm, felt great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus it came with clips and headbands which is an added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying to grow my hair out so I think as it grows this device will still be so much easier than my tradition hair dryer with comb attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one ladies!</li>
    <li> Washing my daughters hair is quite a chore and I&#x27;m trying not to break down and put any chemicals in it.  I was so pleased with this product.  It really dried and straightend her hair.  Afterwards I didn&#x27;t even need the flat iron, I jut used the edge stick on her edges and ponytailed it up and we were done.  Great price, great product</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and thought ok, I&#x27;ll try it. I was very disappointed. A lot of the reviews said it was good for African American Hair. BEWARE! It almost pulled my hair out. WAY TOO MUCH STRESS ON MY HAIR! Thank you</li>
    <li> I like to wear my hair neat, not artificially straight, but naturally straight. However, I was born with wavy hair with lots of frizz, so I need to blow dry my hair to achieve that look. Unfortunately, I have small hands, the traditional pulling the hair with a brush on one hand and blowdrying with the other is very tiring for me; I don&#x27;t know how to get it right by looking at the mirror; I hate to pull my hair, touching them when it&#x27;s hot. This is the only blowdryer I can handle, given the fact that it&#x27;s relatively light weight. As I said, it&#x27;s a more like a blow-dryer than a straightener, so it won&#x27;t give you perfect smooth hair. I glide it through my hair after washing, it helps my hair to dry tidily. Sadly, there is one design flaw: the \\&quot;ventilation fan\\&quot; at the back of the tool sucked in my long hair several times, and when it happens, you will have to cut to release your hair. :( Also, after that happened for 3 times, the ventilation fan stopped working, and the tool turned \\&quot;bright red hot\\&quot; inside with the smell of burning plastic, it become unusable and dangerous. To summarize, if you are an amateur of blowdrying with not so long hair, this will definitely do the work with ease, just beware to keep your hair away the ventilation part, or it will kill both of your hair and the tool.</li>
    <li> Great and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Works great and even handles my type 4 African American hair and no more comb breaks!  I was very surprised that this little dryer could actually dry and straighten my hair.  I use it when I travel and I love it. I bought the larger version for home use but this one works just as good, just rakes a little longer to dry my hair.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy hair and use a straightener.  When I read about this product, I thought it sounded like what I had waiting for all my life! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It made my hair drab and flat.  I will go back to my former styling method.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how it worked when I ordered this product, It is unlike other straightners. It&#x27;s really neat, it works like a hair brush. I love it because I can let my hair air dry untill it is only damp, then use the straightner to dry and straighten my hair at the same time, cutting styling time in half. The straightner also gives me more volume than blowdrying does. I love the results I get with this product and have recomended it to family. I have shoulder length hair and it works great, but if you have short hair it may not be as effective because of the design of the product. My hair is also thick, so don&#x27;t worry about that.</li>
    <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about my arm getting tired, with thick and curly hair I had given up on the straight style. Thanks Infiniti!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Easy to use with my naturally curly hair.  I can use it to straighten part of my hair or all or it.  Sometimes when I want it all straight, it is easier to use the blow drier and dry most of it, then use the styler.    Glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I have already returned mine that I bought from here. Trust me, it&#x27;s not worth the $50. It made my hair really frizzy and is more of blow dryer than a straightener. When I usually straightener I like to listen to music or watch TV, but with this I can&#x27;t do either because it makes that noise that blow dryers make. It just really doesn&#x27;t straighten hair that well either. Save yourself a lot of regret and don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> I bought this iteam because I have thick, tightly coiled hair and I have no perm and it is sometimes hard to get my hair straight my self, but when I purchased this iteam it made my hair straight enough so i can press it out with a straighting comb this product works for thick hair and I highly reccomend it to women with naturally thick long hair.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly, shoulder length hair I have used every dryer method and professionally straightened my hair.  FINALLY A PRODUCT THAT DOES WHAT IT SAYS.  This is lightweight, not only straightens but keeps body in it and the best part my hair looks so healthy &amp; shiny not broken or frizzy It looks like I just walked out of the salon.  Great product!!!  I&#x27;m buying four more for Christmas gifts!</li>
    <li> I had the Infiniti Hair Designer by Conair, and loved it, but lost the attachment in a move. So when I first saw the Hot Air Styler I wanted it but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay $50.00 for it. Well I finally broke down and bought it and \\&quot;OH MY GOODNESS\\&quot; it is fantastic. I have very curly hair and smoothed it out nicely, my daughter&#x27;s hair is chemically relaxed and it left her hair nice and soft. I would recommend thi[[ASIN:B000ME2YWG Infiniti by Conair BC173 Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Wet Dry Straightening Hot Air Styler]].    Linda</li>
    <li> Our 13 year old daughter begged my wife and I to get this Infiniti BC173 Tourmaline Ceramic Straightening Hot Air Styler for her as a Christmas gift.  We hesitated to spend $50 on this unit, without knowing if it would live up to its claims, but we gave in and bought it for her anyway.  She squealed with excitement when she opened her gift.  She couldn&#x27;t wait to break it out of its box and try it right away.  After taking a shower she decided to give it a try.  She fought with this device for almost 30 minutes before giving up.  The unit wouldn&#x27;t grip her hair well enough and it just didn&#x27;t dry her dair much at all.  I told her that I had read several reviews that indicated a learning curve before getting the wanted results from this hot air styler.  After ner next shower she dryed her dair most of the way with a hair dryer.  She then tried the Conair Infiniti BC173 again, but the end results were nearly the same.  She noticed that this air styler seemed to add a mild frizziness to her hair, even though the unit is supposed to prevent frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our daughter has used this product again and again, over the past several weeks, and she has determined that the unit is just not for her.  She ended up spending some Christmas money on a good hair dryer and a cheap hair straightener.  She now gets the desired results, and this Conair Infiniti BC173 is just sitting, unused, in a bathroom drawer.  She says that she will still try it again, in the future, but overall it looks as though we have wasted our money on this fairly expensive product.  My wife has tried it as well, as seems to be slightly better results, but still this model is certainly not worth the inflated price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem seems to be that the hair is not held tight enough against the ceramic elements.  The dryer feature just doesn&#x27;t do much drying, and the lack of proper hair tension allows the hair to become slightly frizzy, and just doesn&#x27;t straighten well at all.  I think this product is a great idea, and the BC173 certainly feels well built and looks very cute.  However, the usefulness of this tool is questionable, and my wife and I are not too happy about spending $50 for something that will likely remain in a drawer over the months and years to come.  Because of these dissapointing results, I would not recommend this product to anyone.  If Conair can improve on the design, adding more tension in holding the hair in place against the ceramic elements, I think they will have a real winner.  I hope it works better for other consumers, but my wife and daugher have nothing but dissapointment in this ceramic wet/dry straightening air styler.  We learned a valuable (but rather expensive) lesson.  Think seriously before buying this product.  It may work wonderfully for some but seems to be a real letdown for others.s a great idea, and the BC173 certainly feels well built and looks very cute.

    <li> Many of the negative reviews on here indicate that the reviewers were disappointed with the results this product gave them compared to using a flat iron.  As a former flat iron user, I will agree with them that this unit does not produce results like a flat iron, but that is because it is better than a flat iron.    At the salon, they do not send me out the door with my naturally wavy-to-curly hair stick-straight and plastered to my head by using a flat iron.  I do not pay them for that.  Instead they blow dry my hair, using the brush to give it a smooth appearance and shape it.  That is what this tool does - smooths and shapes my hair, while drying it, because it&#x27;s just a tiny hair dryer in a brush.  I am not disparaging it in its simplicity, though, because using this product has made my hair look more like it was done by a professional, more easily, than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s genius and I love it.  But if for some reason you love stick-straight flat-ironed hair, stay away.    I would give it 5 stars, but the sticker price is too high.  I paid it, but we all know that this product could easily go for less, which is probably why amazon is selling it for less.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know what took someone so long to invent something like this.  I have wavey hair, but can wear my hair both straight or wavey/curly.  When I want to wear it straight this infiniti by conair really makes blowing a breeze.  You don&#x27;t need an extra brush you can hold your hair and comb/blow at the same time.  What a great idea.  I totally recommended to anyone.</li>
    <li> I had been tempted to try this styling product since it first appeared on the market but hesitated because I just wasn&#x27;t sure how it would work for me.  So I continued to blow my hair dry, followed by a hot brush followed by Velcro rollers.  Jeez - it was a major ordeal to get the smooth look I wanted to say nothing of keeping it.  I knew it was possible because my stylist does it with no problem but achieving that look myself was challenging to say the least.    When I saw the price here on Amazon, which included free shipping and no sales tax I decided it was now or never.  The reviews were mixed, some people loved it and others were very unhappy.  Still others were so-so about it.  I wondered what category I would fall into.    Well I am pleased to say it has worked beautifully for me, from the first time (actually I&#x27;ve only used it twice so I&#x27;m assuming I will get even better at using it as I get more practice).  I followed the advice of the other reviewers and let my hair towel dry and then air dry for a little so it was damp but not soaking wet.  I did divide my hair into sections, then began with the bottom layer and worked up.  I used the highest settings on both the tension and the heat as I have thick wavy/frizzy (not curly) hair.  I wear my hair in an inverted bob, stacked in the back and chin length in the front with no bangs.    The styling went fairly fast and before I knew it I had a hairdo very comparable to what my stylist gives me.  I was absolutely amazed.  Smooth, shiny hair - no weird waves or bumps or frizzes flying everywhere.  Could this be my hair??     The best part is the style has held for days, though exercise classes, mean bosses, damp weather and anything else life could throw at me.  I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
    <li> As someone who previously never did more than \\&quot;stir-dry\\&quot; my soft wavy hair for a perfect coif, having my post-chemotherapy hair come in with dry, frizzy curls left me feeling clumsy in all styling efforts. Curling irons confound me, but the Conair Wet/Dry styler was easy to use and smoothed my hair back to a more recognizable texture.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer claims to style, smooth and streighten. Don&#x27;t count on it. I have medium lenghth fine hair and I wish I never bought it. However, it might work on longer hair? Not a high probability. Forget this product and empty promises.</li>
    <li> Firstly, the box gave no indication that it was actually a dryer and basically the hot air (that wasn&#x27;t even hot) heats the straightening gadget (which did a crappy job of straightening). I started on one section of my well towel dried hair and then kept working on it, and kept working on it, and kept working on it...it was barely drying my hair! The top part was pretty straight, but the bottom half of my shoulder length hair was sort of waved. Ugh, just a piece of complete junk! I dried my hair a little better with my blowdryer thinking maybe it was just too wet for the thing to handle, but nope, even on slightly damp hair it sucked. My hair is not even all that wavy; I just like the look of shiny, stick-straight hair. I feel sorry for anyone with curly hair and tries to use this. I am taking it back and getting a real straightening iron.</li>
    <li> First of all, the cord is way too long.  Second, the high setting went the second time I used it so now the high is like the low.  The good thing is I like the way this straightens.  You have to have your hair partially dry for it to work the best because it really doesn&#x27;t dry really wet hair.  So, my final thought is the concept is good but there needs to be improvements made in order to perfect it.</li>
    <li> After reading the mixed reviews, I took a chance and bought one.  It wasn&#x27;t a total waste, but basically, it is a hair dryer.  When I use it as directed, my hair still requires further streightning with an iron, though only about half as much as it used to. If I had it to do again, I would save the $50, and just buy a better brush to use with my blowdryer.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer. It actually tames my fly-away hair. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because, I guess because of the lower wattage, it takes me a little longer to dry my hair; and also, I think the comb teeth could be just a little longer so you can have more control by grabbing more hair.</li>
    <li> I had one of these before and I was devastated when it stopped working.  I was thrilled to find it here on amazon.  No other brand or style works as well with wet or dry hai.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice product, its very easy to hold, the handle does not get hot, even after extended use.&lt;br /&gt;When you get this straighter do not use it when you are running later for work, or your going somewhere and its your first time using it.  Use this when you have a few moments to spare and play around with the thickness settings.  When you actually have to use it the practice will help.&lt;br /&gt;I notice when I use this my hair has a nice shine to it.  But be warned this product does not replace (at least for me) my flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;I do notice I spend less time blow drying my hair, and the result is a much more polished than with my old Conair Ionic blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;I can also now do this one handed, so I can drink my coffee and blow dry my hair at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;The only other drawback (besides having a hair dryer that you have to practice with prior to usage) is the switch configuration The cool button is at the top, the hot button is below, so if you push the swtich to the top you have cool air.  At 6:15 AM when I&#x27;m not quite awake and trying to blow dry my hair it took awhile to figure out why my hair wasn&#x27;t drying, thankfully it was before I threw this in the trash, which would have been a mistake, it a great product.</li>
    <li> It drives hair quickly and takes out the frizz. Works well on my fine, blonde highlighted hair. Also perfect for restyling. Great for straightening bangs and for giving roots a lift and ends a little swing. I haven&#x27;t used my hair dryer in 2 weeks!</li>
    <li> Honestly, when I opened the box, I thought \\&quot;What a cheap piece of crap\\&quot; and almost sent it back immediately.  Fortunately, I gave it a try.  It really works.  It takes less time with great results - here is the scoop.  I have moderately curly hair.  I like to smooth it out - not pin straight but sleek and shiny.  I have tried almost every wet-dry appliance out there.  All of them require you blow dry your hair at least partially dry.  Even my $100 wet-dry straightening iron would not \\&quot;dry\\&quot; my hair if I start fresh out of the shower wet.  So, this product works best if you \\&quot;rough\\&quot; dry your hair to at least 50% dry. After that, it works beautifully.  My hair is shiny, sleek and smooth.    This appliance is much easier to handle than the round brush and drier - which really give definition to \\&quot;hot mess\\&quot;.  It is easy to manipulate. The comb holds your hair as you move through your hair. The results are quick.  1-2 passes does the job and you can work in bigger, thicker chunks of hair (vs. straighten iron).</li>
    <li> I purchased after reading many reviews.  I have to say that I was a bit disappointed.  I still had to use a flat iron on my hair after using the dryer.  It is much faster for me to use my normal hair dryer and then straighten my hair w/ a flat iron.  It took me twice as long to dry w/ this product and still have to straighten it!  I ended up returning this product.  My time is important and this was not worth the etxra time and effort.</li>
    <li> I just love this dryer.  I let my hair dry by itself almost totally and then spend 10 minutes drying it with this dryer.  My wavy/frizzy/curly hair becomes shiny and straight.  I have been using it for over a year now and it is great.  I just bought a back up in case my original dryer ever breaks down (no sign of it so far).  I find it works great with a keratin treatment or without (although better with it of course).  It does take a wee bit longer than a standard dryer if your hair is soaken wet, but its purpose is more than a dryer as it straightens and shines your hair.  I love it.  UPDATE - after almost daily use for one year and three months it finally bit the dust and i love it so much i bought a new one and another for a birthday gift for a friend.</li>
    <li> Works well overall .. second one in many years. Good quality!!</li>
    <li> It was the best of products, it was the WORST of products!!  I have breezed through about 7 of these exact drying/straightening combs in the last 4 years; I obviously LOVE the item, its the life of the item that bothers me; shouldn&#x27;t it last longer than an average of 3 months??  It starts to smoke and smell in a short time, then I buy another one - one thing&#x27;s for sure, with such a poorly made but great product they&#x27;ll always have job security!!</li>
    <li> I love this dryer, calms my frizzy hair.  The only problem is that it last a little over a year. Over the last 5 years this is my 4th dryer.  I wouldn&#x27;t keep buying it, if it didn&#x27;t do such a great job! I wish they would fix the motor quitting!</li>
    <li> its ok, don&#x27;t really like it because its more blow dryer then staightner. I would rather have just a straightner</li>
    <li> I love my hair dryer, it was well worth it.</li>
    <li> Got this instead of the &amp;#34;3 in 1&amp;#34;. Much easier to use and it does straighten my hair.</li>
    <li> I have super thick hair so most styling brushes like this do not work for me. This one did a great job. It straightened and shined. It got rid of Fritz by itself most days so I didn&#x27;t need to flat iron as often.</li>
    <li> Must be careful not to over heat it. I use another high powered drier to get most of the wetness out and smooth with this styler. Do small sections at a time. Be very careful like all hair driers not to let any stray strands of hair get into the vent at the base.&lt;br /&gt;Good for touch up too to get rid of the frizz. Really good for frizzy hair: I live in Florida where it is very humid.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I had to learn the hard way how to not abuse this awesome hair drier. I went through a few that over-heated and quit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Infiniti Tourmaline Ceramic Wet Dry Hot Air Styler for a few years now and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  I don&#x27;t have curly hair though.  My hair is fine, medium length, straight and flat.  It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of body.  Drying my hair from the roots out with the Infinity gives me the body I need.  I&#x27;ve always looked for hair dryers or curling irons with brushes or teeth to grab my hair because it just makes it easier for me to style my hair and saves time.  I still use a curling iron after to touch up but the body seems to last longer with the Infiniti.</li>
    <li> This is the second Infinit I&#x27;ve owned in the past 10 years. It&#x27;s an awesomely quick way to dry out and smooth my hair after shampooing. Perfect for those straight styles - shortens blow drying time considerably.</li>
    <li> I have this over a year now and it works great for my daily routine. I would recommend this to anyone I know.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, very curly hair.  Love this hair dryer when it actually works.  It never seems to last more than a couple of months before it stops working and has to be replaced.  I wish another company would make something similar so I can switch.</li>
    <li> Love this Hairdryer/Styler....this hairdryer can&#x27;t be found in stores, when I found it on Amozon I was thrilled, my old one of 8 yrs. just up &amp; quit while we were vacationing. I rely on this dryer, because blowing with a standard blow dryer and round brush is just to slow and hard on arms after a while!!!</li>
    <li> These are the best hair dryers for wavy hair and you want to style and dry at the same time.  My last one lasted a few years, found 1 on a clearance sale somewhere, put it away for when mine eventually died.  The day came and I used that one for a few years... Then I could not find this make or model anywhere.  Someone was reading my review on here about the one that replaced this one...I was not happy with that and thought it was a bad dream!  That person messages me to let me know this model was available again... So now I am happy and my hair looks great!</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have EVER bought for my really thick wavey hair!  It REALLY straighten it.  I have bought 7 of them.  Not that they break but afraid they will  quit making this product.  Love love love it!!</li>
    <li> I have  Botticelli curls that tend to flatten and become frizzy during the day.I use this on the number 3 setting and on high heat. When I&#x27;m done I part my hair down the middle and make two buns then spray my hair with hair spray. When I take my hair out of the buns I get that gossip girl hair that lasts. The reason I won&#x27;t give it five stars is because the product need a tighter grip and more power to get curly hair pin straight.</li>
    <li> I have used this hair dryer for many years, and mine just gave out. So I am buying two more to have on hand. It is the only one that has gotten my thick hair straignt with body. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I love it! This is my second one.  Works on my shoulder length layered hair very well.  Very easy to use.....</li>
    <li> It dries your hair but it doesn&#x27;t do the same effect of blow dry with a round brush.</li>
    <li> This dryer is awesome, it works well for four my daughter&#x27;s hair. I plan to give this as gifts this Christmas too.</li>
    <li> It works nice to dry your hair, but I still had to use the flat iron to smooth it out.  Hard to dry the roots with this thing, but was a good purchase nonetheless.</li>
    <li> This item is very poorly designed for using in a UK Home. Need to have a universal plug attachment in order to use it, (unfortunately this was not made clear on the Amazon website and in the description of the electrical appliance).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item is okay to use for no more than 3-4weeks at the most and then it abruptly stops working and is therefore &amp;#34;NOT WORTH THE MONEY YOU PAID FOR IT&amp;#34; and definitely &amp;#34;NO FIT FOR PURPOSE&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost to the return and postage of the item to America is &amp;#34;ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS and ASTRONOMICAL&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll see a return of the additional &amp;#34;SHIPPING COST&amp;#34; I had to paid.</li>
    <li> Ok I&#x27;m impressed. I&#x27;m African American and I have very very curly hair, like natural tight spiral curls and this thing straightened my hair in 10 minutes. My hair was still fluffy and my roots were not straight but if I took my time and dried smaller portions of my hair I think I would have gotten better results. It usually takes about 2 hours to flat iron my hair. This thing is AMAZING. I wish I found it sooner.</li>
    <li> I love this item.  This is my seond one in many years.  I am lost without it.  Makes blow drying sooo easy.</li>
    <li> This is my third one.  I&#x27;ve always had good luck with this appliance.  I consistantly get good results, that&#x27;s why I continue to replace it.  This time I bought it in June and it died yesterday.(3-1/2 months)  I&#x27;m less than happy with the preformance of this one!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very handy and light, but it doesn&#x27;t really stand up to daily use. I&#x27;m on my third one!  Also, considering that conair is not manufacturing them anymore, why is Amazon charging so much for them?  The one I bought must be 5 years old at least!</li>
    <li> I had one of these years ago and I used it everyday. Like other reviewers have said, it seemed to damage my hair: I had more flyways than usual and it seemed to pull some hair out. That being said, it gave me great volume (better than the flat iron/blow dryer combo) and took way less time than blow drying and then straightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought another one, and I use it once a week or so. After a couple months of use, I have to say that I&#x27;ve noticed all the benefits without the damage. So the key is not overusing it. Plan on using on the days when you need to tame the curl and get nice, straight volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast Facts:&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair with gentle ringlets&lt;br /&gt;My hair is shoulder length&lt;br /&gt;I use this item about once a week&lt;br /&gt;It gives me a good look in a reasonable amount of time&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend has a longish bob and also loves it</li>
    <li> I love what it does to my hair. Makes straight, shiny hair. The only thing is that I have gone through 2. They don&#x27;t seem to last more than a year.</li>
    <li> The product came to me with the plug bent so i had to fix it with some pliers... However once fixed it works awesome. Not the same as a straightener, but way better than just a blow drier. I can say i&#x27;m pleased with the product :)</li>
    <li> This is the first time in my life I have been inspired to come online and write a review of a product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I first saw the ad for this on TV, I thought it sounded like just what I needed.  I rushed to the store, but it wasn&#x27;t even on sale yet.  Finally I found it yesterday at walgreen&#x27;s- and I hate to say- it stinks! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have just below shoulder length curly hair.  I generally throw in some gel and let it air dry- I hate spending a lot of time on my hair.  But once in a while I straighten it- which involves blow dry with a round brush, and then using a ceramic flatiron to finish.  I am not very good with a hair dryer, and it takes me a long time and I find it awkward managing the brush and the dryer, and I don&#x27;t do a very good job.  Plus then I need to use the iron too, and it takes me a good 30-45 min total. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So I thought this product would be great.  All in one! A time-saver! Easier to use! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, I was wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;First of all, it took about twice as long just to dry my hair as it would with my hairdryer.  It&#x27;s not very powerful.  Next, it was barely straight!  Even on the \\&quot;4\\&quot; setting, there wasn&#x27;t much tension at all.  It left my hair puffy and frizzy and barely straight.  So after an hour, I had hair that was not as straight as if I had just dried it alone- and I still needed to use the flatiron. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled.  It will NOT give you the flat sleek hair that they picture on the box. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I just hope I can return it. &lt;br /&gt;Guess I will stick with my CHI iron for now. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I *might* try the \\&quot;long hair\\&quot; version of this dryer to see if that&#x27;s any better.</li>
    <li> Just received this and am VERY pleased with it.  I have fine, thick, naturally curly hair with quite a bit of frizz, especially in moisure.  Have combated the curl/frizz all my life - even ironing my hair in the 60&#x27;s.  No matter what product or combination of products I have used to straigten and soften I still would end up with this halo of frizz.  This styler has all but eliminated that!  It&#x27;s easy to use - if you can brush your hair you can manage the appliance.  And all in all it actually takes less time to dry and style than my old normal routine with blow dryer and flat straigtener.  As an added note - originally saw the product in an ad on my browser, clicked on it which took me to the Conair web site.  Conair&#x27;s price was $59.99 plus shipping.  Bought new from Amazon.com for $49.99 - with free shipping!!  I would highly recommend to anyone and I recommend buying here.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy curly dry UGLY troublesome thick hair.  Have tried so very many products and gadgets - just $$ incredible $$.  Then came the Conair Hot Air Styler.  Took just a couple of times to get used to it but now I can&#x27;t live without it!  NOTHING has ever \\&quot;wet to dry\\&quot; straightened my hair the way this little baby did. Even hair stylists can&#x27;t blow my hair straight yet they all claim they can HAH!  Both of my kids tend to walk off with it too.  One has very thin straight hair and uses it to fluff and shape.  The other (male) has fairly short hair with a bit of a wave and uses it to straighten and style.      It does take a bit of work but it is definitely worth it.  It is probably a little bit quicker than using just a flat iron.  Yet the overall effect is so much better than just the flat iron.  Family and co-workers noticed something different; something good.      As for my tricks:  I use Redken Smooth Down Heat Glide Protective Smoother mixed with another oil product on wet hair.  Definitely section off and do small parts at a time.  After I do several sections, I finish it off with a large flat iron.  I&#x27;m good for SEVERAL DAYS!  For me, it&#x27;s amazing.  Nothing has worked this well nor lasted this long.      BTW, this is my first review; I felt that strong about raving on this product.</li>
    <li> This is a tricky thing to use.  I have medium length thick, curly, frizzy hair.  I don&#x27;t think that my hair likes this very much. It takes me a while to get one section dry and straight.  I still have to go over my hair again with a flat iron to get the desired results.  A little disappointed but I think much of the results depend on the type of hair that you have.</li>
    <li> This dryer is not meant for ethnic hair.  My hair doesn&#x27;t get any straighter than it did using a regular blow dryer and brush.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for women of color.</li>
    <li> this straightener is amazing! i have extremely thick hair that i get permanently straightened, but the roots grow back curly very quickly. I have to get it re-straightened every 10 months so inbetween i have curly roots with straight hair, and this product is amazing for that. It is so easy to use and makes the straight part of my hair even straghter.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer/styler is the very best out there!  I have used this brand for the last 15 years and in that time, I have only had to replace it twice.  However, I have three stored in my closet in the event that for whatever reason Conair decides to stop manufacturing them.  Years ago I almost had a panic attack because they were hard to find!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair, and I love this product.  It dries and straightens quickly.  I hope Conair never stops making this product.</li>
    <li> I have extra long wavy thick hair. I&#x27;ve always wanted to be able to straighten my hair on my own without having someone else&#x27;s help or going to a salon. This does dry my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t make it straight, it always makes my hair frizzier and more dull. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s difficult to use</li>
    <li> One of the best hair products on the market.  Works with all types of hair even my curly, frizzy hair.  I highly recommend this hair styler.</li>
    <li> I love this.  I hope they don&#x27;t stop making it.  My hair is wavy/curly and instead of blowing my hair all over the place like traditional dryers, this dryer lets helps calm, tame and straighten my hair.  I only use this now and I own two so I have a backup.</li>
    <li> My sister bought this and she was so happy with the results that I decided to get one too.  I use it when I travel to a quick hair fix.  It is light and does not take a lot space in my bag.  Good buy.</li>
    <li> It does a great job smoothing and straightening curly/frizzy hair. The only problem is that the motor gives out/burns out easily - especially if a loose hair gets into the air intake at the base of the wand. That&#x27;s why I always have a replacement in my cabinet.</li>
    <li> Just what I&#x27;ve been looking for. Easy to use, lightweight, just the right selection of speed and temperature. My hair is very delicate and this wide-tooth comb styler does not stress the hair nor overheat it. It&#x27;s just as the manufacturer descibes which is not always the case, as we know. A great product.</li>
    <li> I could not find another of these in stores where I had purchased two previous hot air stylers in the past. It is a VERY good product, but the motors burn up in around one year...there is a three year warranty, however, and I will keep all my paperwork this time!</li>
    <li> Great to straighten long thick hair.</li>
    <li> Will buy again, exactly as advertised</li>
    <li> This really helps to style my hair.  When I put it in my storage when I moved from Tempe, AZ...it remained in good condition when I moved it out this past March.  I am looking forward to using it again.  I also have a new dryer that I have purchased since then that has a brush too.</li>
    <li> Best product ever!  Hope they never end this product!  I love Conair products but I hope they keep this one forever!</li>
    <li> I really like it. It is really great  I tray it befor so I was spraised that it is hot and make yor hir nice</li>
    <li> Awesome hair styler/dryer!</li>
    <li> The product is easy to use. It leaves my hair shiny and smooth. I enjoy using it and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> great hair styling tool.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a few years, although I haven&#x27;t used it continuously throughout those years. I asked for a particular flat iron for Christmas and received this instead. I didn&#x27;t like it at all at first. BUT, I just started using it in place of my blow dryer and found it&#x27;s actually really effective. I still have to go over it with a flat iron but very little. It definitely cuts down on the time because I don&#x27;t need to flat iron each little section of hair afterwards. I am very sad to say that it did stop working. Unfortunately, it happened when I was really starting to get the hang of and love this tool! I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for a replacement or a substitute and can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s so expensive now! It must have been quite a gem!</li>
    <li> This unit is great, replaced a blow dryer and ceramic plates straightener as this both styles and straightens, saving me a lot of time. Not heavy and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I got this on sale for $34.99 a few months ago.  I&#x27;m very disappointed because it works as though I should&#x27;ve paid $9.99. I wish i never bought it. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake as I did. I wish I had bought one with actual bristles. It does not straighten what-so-ever either. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t seem to have the talent for using a round brush with a blow dryer. I have also tried round brush dryers, but this is the best tool for drying my curly hair and getting it ready for a super quick run through with the flat iron. You don&#x27;t need to use two tools at the same time since it combs through your hair while you dry it. My hair is shinier with the use of this styler due to the flocking on the teeth and it dries it very quickly since it&#x27;s an ionic dryer. I had bought one when they first came out, and when it finally died, I bought another one. I just haven&#x27;t found anything that works as well or as easily.</li>
    <li> I love love love my hair designer. Its fabulous,  have very short hair and is so much easier and quicker than a flatiron</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why I spent all these years using a regular blow dryer. This is sooooooo much more effective.&lt;br /&gt;This allows me to brush/ comb through my hair while its drying.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in love with this item.</li>
    <li> Unable to figure out how to use regular blow dryer and a brush at the same time (coordination issue!), this is the perfect answer.  As a matter of fact,  this is my third one. I use it &#x27;til it dies.</li>
    <li> Works great for straightening your hair without overdoing it like a regular straightener. I wish Consir still made these available at stores</li>
    <li> I use this to touch up my hair after blow drying it with the conair infiniti pro dryer with brush attachment. It takes about 5 min just to smooth ends/smooth out any spots I missed with the brush dryer as well as to style my side-swept bangs. I also use it on dry hair to smooth out my bangs on days when I don&#x27;t wash my hair. It works really well and easier and faster than using a straightening iron.</li>
    <li> This is my second one of these.  I use it when I am drying my daughters hair..The first one i purchased about 8 or 9 years ago still works but it is grungy.  I love this dryer because i don&#x27;t have to have to worry about using a comb or brush, this makes it so much easier to dry her hair.</li>
    <li> one burned out after a year. had to get a new one. But when its working does the job</li>
    <li> I have owned these before and could never find one in a store to replace my old one.  I was so happy to go on-line and locate them.  I ordered two.  They are the best answer for me and my hair type.</li>
    <li> I bought this in December 2013 &amp; it broke mid April 2014. The unit&#x27;s air pressure became extremely weak &amp; stopped blowing hot/warm. I emailed Conair via their website &amp; got a response after a week. Their response was to call their customer service hotline. After waiting 10 minutes to speak to a customer service representative, I was told that this unit has a 3 year limited warranty. I&#x27;d have to send it back to them at my own expense &amp; add a $7 money order to the package. That means postage to &amp; fro with an unwarranted trip to the post office. Not worth the trouble &amp; honestly, I&#x27;ll steer clear from Conair products in the future. Less than 4 months of use at 2-3 times a week &amp; it goes kaput. It may have been a faulty item but the company does not stand by their product.  Update: The 2nd one lasted till January 2015 (7 months). Better than the first (4 months). FORGET THIS. Bought something else.</li>
    <li> Please keep these in stock. It&#x27;s one of the only ways to dry hair without having to keep both arms above your shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;I have a bad shoulder and I love this styler.</li>
    <li> I started using the Infiniti hair designer several years ago and loved how it dried and straightened my hair at the same time! When I found out that it was no longer being manufactured, I panicked and searched the web to find more....can&#x27;t live without it. I found 3 through Amazon and bought all of them. I can now breathe easily.</li>
    <li> I ordered a second one after using my first  for several years. Too clumsy for regular round brush, this one is so easy!  Now have one at home and one for travel and second home.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful hair dryer because the ceramic \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; really make my hair shine even before I use any shining agents.&lt;br /&gt;It can be used for those who have very coily/curly natural hair or for relaxed hair. It is a game changer for me considering the amount of time it takes to dry &amp; straighten my hair! It doesn&#x27;t overheat my hair - perfect results. (Also, it has warm, hot &amp; also a cool setting)</li>
    <li> It is light and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I still have not learned to handle well. My daughter and I have slightly wavy hair and every time I try to spend this device felt my hair very dry and frizz. I think I need to learn to manipulate.</li>
    <li> One of the best for my hair. So glad my friend recommended me this one.</li>
    <li> My wife has owned and used this model since it first came out. It is the easiest one to straighten and style her very curly hair.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. This is the third I&#x27;ve bought over 8 years. There is a warranty but ive never used it. That is my only negative-if a hair gets sucked through the back it can short the system. It&#x27;s great for someone who is not talented enough to hold a blowdryer and a brush. So I just flip my head over and run it through. You wont get stick straight hair like a Straightener will do, but for my curly hair, it comes out great!</li>
    <li> I love this Styler. I have purchased 4 just in case they stop making it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and when I went online to purchase another one the price went up 50 dollars more!! So for the current price I would give it 2 stars</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 4 of these.  Love the way they work but they burn out after 3 to 8 months!  Gave up on them.  Alot of money at $50+ each!</li>
    <li> This product is great!  It drys my hair much faster than a blow dryer and my hair is smooth and shiny when I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this for my short hair style. Than immediately returned. The ceramic heating element is so HOT! It burned my fingers. Sounded like it was scalding my wet hair. Even using with dried hair it was impossible and did nothing as expected. Not a good product.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick course curly hair (I&#x27;m bi-racial). This blow dryer does a great job. I used to use a round brush and blow dryer or a double sided boar brush and blow dryer. This replaces all of the above. Great blow dryer, cuts down on dry time and helps smooth out the curls.</li>
    <li> I have yet to find a system that straightens my curly hair better.  Flat irons FLATTEN and make hair look thin and boring.  The Infiniti Pro does straighten my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t take away the body and fullness of it.  Hope Conair never stops making it!</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews I had really hoped I would be able to use this hair dryer and skip the flat iron. Not happening. Also, the wattage is so low that I had to air dry my hair for nearly an hour first.Otherwise it would have taken me over half an hour to dry using the styler immediately after shampooing. That additional time for air drying is not always an option. My hair is chin length on the sides and very short in the back. Although my hair is quite thick it isn&#x27;t long. This dryer does help remove some of the frizz, but I still need to use the flat iron to get rid of the &amp;#34;bulkiness&amp;#34; and smooth it. I think this dryer would be a great option for two of my friends who have thinner more layered hair. It would give them the curl and the volume without having to dry and then use the curling iron.</li>
    <li> I bought this in 2009 when it was only $14, and I absolutely LOVED it. I have thick naturally curly 3B/3C hair and it gets my hair almost straight. It broke after using it every week for several years but I can never go back to using a different hair dryer. I like the pull the comb has on my hair. You can adjust the width of the comb.  I have never used any other brand in blow dryers but I like that I don&#x27;t have to assemble this one to use it. It is easy to grip and easy to store.</li>
    <li> Love the product but it does not last for more than 2 weeks before it starts getting too hot and burning your hair</li>
    <li> After 5+ years, my wife&#x27;s original Infiniti Pro finally stopped working.  She tried other dryers but was never as satisfied.  I was happy to come across this on Amazon.  Since receiving it, I get a big THANK YOU every time she has to use it on herself or one of our daughter&#x27;s hair.  Now I think I love this dryer as much as my wife does.  I&#x27;m not a beautician so in case it matters, my wife and daughters all have thick, African-American hair.  According to my wife, this dryer saves her hours when washing all 3 heads of hair on the same night.</li>
    <li> its good for the price I guess I thought it would curl your hair just a basic hair straightener good for the price</li>
    <li> Love it. I have had one for many years and it is still going great. I bought this one for my daughter in law. Hope she loves hers as much as I do mine. It is a great dryer, but it a terrific styler as well. Creates shiny hair.</li>
    <li> I loved this hairdryer/styler until it stopped working. The concept is great and while it worked it did exactly as advertised. It dried my hair while getting all of the advantages of a large round brush at the same time. It was nice to have an all in one tool. But then one day about 4 months after I purchased it, it just suddenly shut off. I checked the test/reset button and Everything was fine there. It just suddenly stopped working in the middle of my using it. I really wish this had been made with the quality of other conair hair dryers I had purchased in the past.</li>
    <li> This is my first review and before purchasing this product I am pretty sure I read all of them. I have african american hair and I am currently transitioning (going from permed hair to natural). I was looking for a product that I could use with low heat and was easy to use because I am pretty much hair appliance challenged. I am dealing with two different textures, wavy and very curly...this was able to get my hair reasonably straight without pulling a lot of my hair out. Now don&#x27;t go expecting to have a salon blow out ...but it definitely makes your hair soft and manageable. I just finished using it and I think I&#x27;m hooked for when I don&#x27;t feel like actually working hard on my hair. So I think it&#x27;s worth giving it a shot.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd one I purchased. I had the first one for many years and then it burned out. Love how it straightens and dries my hair.</li>
    <li> I have very curly fine hair and this is the only hair dryer that smooths my hair with minimal damage.  They last fairly well even when they are used everyday the damage to my hair was minimal.  I had a hard time finding the same dryer and was very happy to find one here.</li>
    <li> I bought this but i dont really use it. I am all natural with 4b/4c hair and i thought it would be brilliant but it does not work for me.</li>
    <li> This has always been my best hair straightener, I use it mostly on my hair when its dry. I was so upset when my old one died and I couldn&#x27;t no longer find it in stores. I was very excited to order it on Amazon! Shipping was quick and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it. Of course I will order again.</li>
