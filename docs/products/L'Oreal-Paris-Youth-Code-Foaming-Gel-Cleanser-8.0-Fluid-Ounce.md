      <li>Try Roc pore minimizing face wash, I have found this to be a much better product.</li>
      <li>and I was even able to wash my eye</li>
      <li>This is my favorite cleanser.  </li>
      <li>Compared to a soap it does need more water to wash it off your face cos it probably has some oil .</li>
      <li>love this cleanser.  </li>

      <li>Suffice it to say my skin&#x27;s very very fussy (fair, oily) and it loves Youth Code.  </li>
      <li>At first, I was completely in love with the Youth Code foaming gel cleanser, because it smelled great, it felt very nice on my skin, and didn&#x27;t make my skin dry.</li>
      <li>recommend, it is also a huge bottle and so cheap on line !</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great face wash except it made mine have a whole bunch of blackheads</li>
    <li> Smells so fresh and so clean. I also like how it makes my skin feel. Remove eye makeup?! No problem!!</li>
    <li> Dries your skin out! No hydration and if you have mature, dry or very dry skin, this is not the cleanser for you!</li>
    <li> I went to the store one day to purchase some more of the facial cleanser that I was in love with. I found this product instead, presumably replacing the old product (Skin Genesis line). I thought, \\&quot;Same bottle, same color, they must be rebranding.\\&quot; Supposedly the ingredients are the same just in a different order...?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old stuff was marketed to diminish large pores and be gentle enough to take off eye make-up (right on the front of the bottle! not mixed up in description on the back). I&#x27;ve gone through 2-3 bottles of this stuff and I have to say I am not impressed with it. It really doesn&#x27;t do anything for my pores, at least not as well as the old stuff. Also, it doesn&#x27;t take off my eye make-up as well as it&#x27;s predecessor; I have to use more pressure to get it off and it irritates my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes across as a basic facial cleaner. I will be looking elsewhere for a wash to deal with my large pores.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  My face so smooth and so beautiful</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face cleaner for several years.  It does all it claims to.  Unfortunately, I can no longer buy it in town but was glad to find it cheaper on Amazon.  I&#x27;m 40 and this helps keep my skin looking much younger.</li>
    <li> I loved this product.  It is now priced out of my price range.</li>
    <li> So good product if not the best I ever try, my skin looks so smooth and healthy have elasticity and smell sweet. now I can say buy it but the market is full of product maybe good maybe better but don&#x27;t waste you money finding out try it you will never regret it and you skin may love it</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Very good for &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; skin that is irritated by even the mildest soaps. Have used it for years.</li>
    <li> I had never used this product line for skin care before and I am pleasantly surprised. This cleanser doesn&#x27;t dry out my face like several other products I have tried. I have noticed a definite difference in the look and cleanliness of my skin since I started using it. It also doesn&#x27;t require a lot of product to foam and clean which means it will last me longer and save me money. I love this product!</li>
    <li> Thank goodness, a cleanser that does not dry me out and makes my face feel like I have already applied moisturizer. I use this with my nars moisturizer and my youth code serum and wow! This is my go to cleanser now.</li>
    <li> Let me just say my skins sucks because I have oily skin and large pores. This doesn&#x27;t help my face other than removing make up. Just make sure you avoid getting it into your eyes because it stings so much....</li>
    <li> also removes makeup well.  I highly recommend the product for facial cleansing.  it should last a while as just a small amount is needed to do the job</li>
    <li> This is an excellent facial cleanser. It has a great smell and it really works. It&#x27;s not greasy or too oily. It leaves your skin fresh and renew.</li>
    <li> Love how it foams, great for removing make up, leaves your face refreshed. Best face cleanser I have used and I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Received this Gel Cleanser the next day after purchasing.. A+ for speedy delivery... But ive only used this a few times and so far so good... makes my face feel nice a clean ... the smell is great!... Makes me look forward to washing my face instead  of it being such a chore...</li>
    <li> I can feel this wash clean deep down even with makeup on. It gets rid of everything! It also exfoliates. The smell is amazing and leaves my face oil free but rejuvenated and moisturized. I will be using this facial wash from now on! I have used literally everything to find something that would keep my makeup on longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a year in the morning and in the evening. It perfectly cleans your face and neck, leave the skin smooth, fresh, and ready for moisturizer or serum!</li>
    <li> I was a user of the L&#x27;Oreal Skin Genesis Pore Minimize Gel Cleanser - once they quit making this product i was horribly upset...it was the only cleanser i found that removed all my makeup and minimized my pores.  I tried countless other products with NO LUCK.  I ran across the L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code Foaming Gel Cleanser and thought i would try it since it was in the same family, the bottle is just like what they packaged the pore minimizer in.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  After a week of using this product twice a day i can see a HUGE difference in my skin, the texzture alone and its sooooo soft!  I was very surprised.  I can&#x27;t wait to try the other Youth Code products L&#x27;Oreal makes.  If you haven&#x27;t tried this product yet its a must.</li>
    <li> i really love the way it makes my face feel, i will buy this product again in the near future</li>
    <li> Created dry patches on my face. If you have dry skin at all I would not recommend this cleanser. It smells awesome but it&#x27;s a little harsh for dry or sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have been trying various wash-off facial cleansers for many years. My big concern is always removing my my eye makeup so I don&#x27;t have to use a separate remover. This is the one and first cleanser that also removes eye makeup and mascara completely. I have always been frustrated when other cleansers leave mascara stains on your face, but this one seems to take everything off. It&#x27;s as easy as washing your face.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup, so I can&#x27;t say how well it removes foundation, etc, but this skin care system (I&#x27;m using this product, the serum and the day/night cream) have evened out my complexion and diminshed the appearance of some mild acne scars that were on my cheeks. Of the three products, this one probably has the strongest fragrance- it is a floral fragrance but I really like it. And while I can see why some people would say it&#x27;s old-lady-ish, I think it&#x27;s more like the fragrance/beauty section of a nice department store. It leaves my skin feeling clean but not dried out. Really good stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so mad, I bought this product to carry it in my purse to wash my face when I go to the gym after work, but the cap arrived broken, and I can tell it was broken before they send it, because the pieces into the package weren&#x27;t enough to rebuilt the broken cap, sooo desapointed.</li>
    <li> I had used it a couple of times and it seemed to be ok, until I came into the bathroom to find the bottle still hanging in the mesh holder I put it in, completely empty, and its contents all over my shower and other items in the mesh holder. Apparently, the bottom of the bottle just split right open, and I have no idea how.</li>
    <li> OMG this product is terrfic I use it daily and it works wonderfully. I will buy again for sure it removes my stubborn makeup and leave my skin soft and firm.</li>
    <li> This cleanser has done wonders for my skin.  I had tried a lot of products on my dry, dry skin to little effect.  This cleanser and the related serum is wonderful.  I bought a sample size trial set, and within 3 days had placed an order for this full size version.  The gentle, healing quality of this cleanser is just what I have been looking for.</li>
    <li> Very disapointed :( product came open and leaking, bottle has broken pump...</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t change my skin issues at all.  Didn&#x27;t really make it worse but didn&#x27;t help either.  I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel harsh on skin and has reduced some of the pimples I get from time to time on my forehead . Compared to a soap it does need more water to wash it off your face cos it probably has some oil . But without that oil it may not have the smoothing and moisturizing effects . Overall , I am happy with it .</li>
    <li> This stuff smells pretty dang good (kind of like a new barbie from back in the day). It works OK, I havent noticed any improvements or worsening of my skin. I might go back to my old brand, though. Eh.</li>
    <li> Absolutely makes a difference in keeping my skin refreshed and looking less &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34;. Very good for make-up removal as well.</li>
    <li> They quit selling this about a year ago and started making something else similar in a blue bottle, but I couldn&#x27;t find it where I moved. The new foaming gel didn&#x27;t have the same nice scent like this one, and that&#x27;s what I missed.</li>
    <li> So far so good! It leaves an icy cold feeling on my face after every wash! I would suggest this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since November 2013 and the texture of my face has significantly evened out. For anyone with acne prone skin, redness or just looking for something new, this product is wonderful. One pump is enough for the entire face and it&#x27;s great day/night. 10 out of 10 from me!!</li>
    <li> Love this product and the nice aroma.  It does hurt to pay more in shipping than the products cost though.</li>
    <li> It smells really good you&#x27;ll feel clean without making your skin dry. It just that it&#x27;s not for me coz since I used their product I got a lot of pimples.</li>
    <li> The only face wash I can use on my dry/sensitive skin. Works really well with the Buff Puff (that&#x27;s how I use it). I can&#x27;t find it in any store in our town in Interior Alaska so I&#x27;m glad I can get it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> It is a very good cleanser. The price is right and very gentle. I have a very sensitive skin and it works for me.</li>
    <li> this is hard to find in stores around me, I just wish it wasn&#x27;t an add on item so I can order it whenever I need it a little easier.  My order arrived broken, but amazon replaced it easily and within 2 days</li>
    <li> This wash is gentle and smells great. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and really leaves my skin feeling clean and clear!</li>
    <li> i have oily and dry skin. i have try all kinds and this is the best.  its smell delicioso.</li>
    <li> Not happy with this product; have dry sensitive skin, and this cleanser made my skin burn and sting.</li>
    <li> Love it, only face cleanser I use. I agree with all other 5 star reviews.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cleanser for a few months now and I am very happy with the results I have gotten from using it daily.  My skin looks and feels better.  I have very sensitive skin that dries out easily and I have found that this cleanser really helps to keep my skin looking younger and feeling less dry.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best cleansers I&#x27;ve found for aging skin, even compared to the expensive department store brands.  It has a mild exfoliating action and removes all makeup in one lathering.  It smells divine which makes it fun to use - I absolutely love the scent.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. It does it well without stripping my face and the fragrance is lovely.</li>
    <li> I got this product in Walmart and excited to try it. After couple times use, it leaves my skin redness and itch. I trust what it says that its for normal-dry skin but now im suffering from itch. I recommend not buying this product if you have dry sensetive skin. Overall, this product is great, but just not for me.</li>
    <li> Just love this stuff :)  My skin feels absolutely wonderful after use in the shower and looks fantastic when I&#x27;m done :)  Will be a lifetime purchaser of this cleanser :))</li>
    <li> Found this at Target, loved it, then I couldn&#x27;t find it there again. Great daily facial soap in easy to use pump.</li>
    <li> I really love this cleanser! I have used all kinds of cleansers, and I&#x27;m so impressed with the way this product works. It takes off all my makeup and leaves my skin so smooth. I don&#x27;t generally use waterproof mascara, so don&#x27;t know how it does with that stuff, but for every day mascara, no problem. It also smells heavenly, without actually smelling like putting perfume on your face. Great product all around, would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is my FAVORITE face wash ever. It is so gentle and removes all traces of my makeup and waterproof mascara. The scent is absolutely amazing. I use it once a day (at night) and it&#x27;s perfect for me, I probably wouldn&#x27;t use it more than once a day because it might dry your skin.</li>
    <li> I buy this whenever I can. I does improve my skin slightly, along with the other youth code products. My pores are smaller and skin texture has improved. This gel cleanser goes a long way,  you only need one pump to clean the face. Ive used many face cleansers over the years and this is by far the best stuff. I will continue to buy as long as they continue to make it. It also cleans my make up brushes well too.</li>
    <li> I really like this and will likely buy again...but going to try purity next. I would recommend. Not sure why this was discontinued.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have been using this for over a year now and it is the best wash I have found yet.</li>
    <li> Overall this is a great product. I&#x27;m in my mid-30&#x27;s with very sensitive skin that&#x27;s combination that still breaks out from time to time. I have noticed a significant difference in the overall tone and texture of my skin from using this line. The face wash is a gel texture that doesn&#x27;t over dry or cause sensitivity with twice daily use. I purchased the whole product line and I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day and I just love it!</li>
    <li> Is this discontinued?  I hope not.  Please not.  Smells lovely, actually removes eye makeup, pump bottle.  Sounds simple but so difficult to find...</li>
    <li> I found this to be a really great product. I would definitely recommend it to others, a very happy purchase.</li>
    <li> Something about this irritates my allergies. use with caution. It doesn&#x27;t break me out, I just can&#x27;t breathe.</li>
    <li> clean very nice my skin. hapyy with the purchase. I got married with this brand because work perfectly on me.</li>
    <li> I will continue ordering as needed from Amazon as long as they continue to carry it.  It does a good job cleaniing my face without drying the skin.  It takes off waterproof eye makeup with ease.  I would recommend it to everyone.  It is a good product &amp; reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> First learned about this product because it was on an Allure Magazine Best New Product list last year.  Tried it and was so pleased with how clean and refreshed it made my face feel.  You donot need much, a small dot, and it foams up to cover your entire face and neck.  Leaves skin feeling clean,moisturized.  Unforunately, have not been able to find in the drug stores and luckily, on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I ordered on Sunday and got it Monday. Wow!!! Awesome product...it gets a great foaming texture during wash and it makes my skin feel so soft after. I use the entire youth code regiment 2x a day (am and pm) and my skin looks 100% better than it did prior. Pores are smaller and my skin is so soft to the touch. I love this cleanser and the entire Youth Code line.</li>
    <li> The L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code Foaming Gel Cleanser, 8 Fluid Ounce is a great face wash product.  It leaves your face clean and oil free and smells great.  This is a fantastic choice if you want a facial cleanser that rejuvenates your skin in a convenient pump device.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> I loved it! came unopened. full. proper packaging. No hassle. Received it in the predicted time.</li>
    <li> love this cleanser.  smells great too!</li>
    <li> I use this for my face, as body wash as well and I love the smell. But then I also do own the Skin Genesis Purifier for the face, I alternate between both , and I love the make up wipes from the same line. Same amazing soooo fresh smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend, it is also a huge bottle and so cheap on line !</li>
    <li> After using this wash for 1month, I found my pores enlarging. This is not a good substitute for the old Loreal skin Genisis pore minimizer face wash ,which can not be bought any more. Try Roc pore minimizing face wash, I have found this to be a much better product.</li>
    <li> Since loreal discontinued this cleanser I deceided to buy it here on amazon while they still have it and i ve been using this cleanse since it first came to market and it was gentle on my skin and I was even able to wash my eye make up with it however either the one I bought on amazon was old or not original loreal because I had major skin breakout right after I washed my face and it continued everyday after I washed my face so Beware !!!</li>
    <li> I AM 58 AND IT WAS TIME TO RE-PURCHASE MY USUAL PHILOSOPHY FACE WASH....BUT I HATED TO PAY THAT $35 COST AGAIN...IT&#x27;S SUMMER FUN-TIME AND I HAVE A LOT BETTER THINGS TO SPEND MY MONEY ON. DON&#x27;T GET ME WRONG...THEIR \\&quot;PURITY MADE SIMPLE\\&quot; 12 OZ. PRODUCT IS A NICE THICK FOAM AND THE BOTTLE LASTS FOR A LONG TIME. BUT IT IS PRICY AND I WAS HOPING THERE WOULD BE A LOWER PRICE PRODUCT OUT THERE THAT WOULD DO THE JOB JUST AS LUXURIOUS AND LAST A LONG TIME...I MEAN IT IS JUST TO WASH THE MAKEUP OFF MY FACE.&lt;br /&gt;SO I SEARCHED MY AMAZON AND FOUND NUMEROUS PRODUCTS TO RESEARCH.  I PURCHASED THE 8 OUNCE L&#x27;OREAL YOUTH CODE FOAMING GEL CLEANSER BECAUSE I SPECIFICALLY WANTED A \\&quot;FOAMING\\&quot; FACE WASH BECAUSE I FEEL FOAM LASTS AND LASTS.  THEIR DESCRIPTION COVERED SEVERAL AREAS, LIKE IT WON&#x27;T DRY OUT MY SKIN.  THE FIRST TIME I USED IT I GOT DISTRACTED WITH SOMETHING ELSE AND A 1/2 HOUR LATER REALIZED I HAD NOT APPLIED MY MOISTURIZERS...AND TO MY SURPRISE MY SKIN WASN&#x27;T FEELING TIGHT AT ALL....THIS WAS A STEP UP FROM THE OTHER PRODUCT.  GO FIGURE.&lt;br /&gt;AND AT WAS ONLY $6.39 WITH PRIME SHIPPING. SO FAR I SEE NO NEGATIVE REACTION TO MY FACE, AND A VERY POSITIVE REACTION TO MY WALLET. JUST ANOTHER GREAT SHOPPING EXPERIENCE WITH AMAZON.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cleanser.  Gentle but cleans well, doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin, and I like the feel of it afterwards.  Nice price, too.</li>
    <li> Each Christmas my girlfriends and I exchange &amp;#34;our favorite things&amp;#34; and this year, this is going to be one of &amp;#34;my favorite things.&amp;#34; It smells good and washes my face clean. I wear a lot of make up for work so this is great, it takes everything off without having to use different products for eyes, etc.</li>
    <li> When I received this item, the liquid leaked out. Not a very good way in packing this item. I bought this item for twice and I faced the same issue. Needs improvement for packaging. Thanks</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would be a cleanser that removes all my makeup, but it isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well on light coverage foundations but not heavier ones such as Revlon&#x27;s Colorstay.</li>
    <li> I bought this product along with the day cream and serum and it took me a few weeks to realize (but I did) that it was the cause of my face feeling itchy for days and days. As soon as I switched back to a different brand of cleanser, the itching stopped. I have sensitive skin and should&#x27;ve known better than to try it.</li>
    <li> Only face wash that takes off my eye makeup! Doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin and last a long time. I use it after I use ponds cold cream to remove my makeup. This gets the eye makeup the cold cream leaves behind.</li>
    <li> IDGI.  It seems like a minute after they introduced this product, they seem to have discontinued it(??)  I still find it at drugstores, but I no longer see it in big box and other stores.  Suffice it to say my skin&#x27;s very very fussy (fair, oily) and it loves Youth Code.  Great with the Clarisonic.  A nice foamy gel, it makes great lather and does a thorough clean without drying, breakouts, or any other adverse reaction.  My skin actually does take on a glow with regular use. A similar product I recommend is [[ASIN:B009DSXT80 Trader Joe&#x27;s Nourish All-in-one-facial Cleanser]].  Same foamy/gel formula in a pump bottle, with an even more impressive ingredient list.</li>
    <li> This product is really great on my daughters&#x27; skin but every store out here does not carry the facewash. They have the moisturizers and toners but not the facewash (I looked at five different locations). So I was happy to find it online. The price was the same as the store and the product identical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had is that one bottle looked like the cap was leaking just slightly. I lost a little bit of the product, but no more than a TBSP at most. I think Loreal needs to redesign the caps..</li>
    <li> A/A female with old and new acne scarring. Combined with the dark spot correcting serum, I love the Youth Code line. My skin is clearing and is very smooth!</li>
    <li> Save your money. It&#x27;s over priced filled with chemicals and doesn&#x27;t do much for your complexion at all. I&#x27;m using pure coconut oil to both cleanse and moisturize my skin. It&#x27;s all natural and the results on my sensitive combo skin have been amazing.</li>
    <li> I love this line.  I am really sensitive to products, I can&#x27;t stand feeling like there is something on my face.  I don&#x27;t use anything but mascara or eyeliner for makeup and have a hard time finding product lines that don&#x27;t mess with my skin (dryness, redness, etc).  I this has improved my skin a lot, I chose it because my 30 year old freckle face was turning into a big old lady blotchy face.  I also use it with the day/night lotion and the cleanser.</li>
    <li> highly recommended. This product is mild and gives enough moisture, it doesn&#x27;t dries out the skin throughout the day and at night my it is easy to remove eye make-up using this compare to other products.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin, and it is not easy for me to find good products that can help me with that. I was looking for something that could help me not only with my dry skin, but also with the few wrinkles I&#x27;m stating to have, so I decided to give the Loreal&#x27;s Youth Code line a try. At first, I was completely in love with the Youth Code foaming gel cleanser, because it smelled great, it felt very nice on my skin, and didn&#x27;t make my skin dry. Unfortunately, the dream was a short-lived one, because 3 days after using this product my skin started to look red and developed lots of pimples. I don&#x27;t consider to have sensitive skin, because I was able to use tons of different products before without having any problems. At first, I thought that maybe the problem with the Youth Code foaming gel was that I was using it in combination with the Day/Night cream and that might be a little to much for my skin, but even though I stopped using the Day/Night cream, the irritation on my skin kept going until I stopped using the gel cleanser. I think the problem might have been the fact that these products contain alcohol, which is very irritating for the skin. Oh well, I learned my lesson and never gonna buy or use these products again, not only because of what happened, but also because they are expensive, and they don&#x27;t do what they promised (¬_¬;)</li>
    <li> I just want to say after using this product along with the loreal youth code day cream my skin is as good as it will ever get and I am super happy with it! Even texture, cleaner pores, the face wash takes off my mascara so I don&#x27;t have to buy eye make up remover;) I love the smell too! I have learned to accept that my skin is not flawless nor will it ever be but again I am Super happy with these products!!!:)</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is Non irritating, rinses clean, and shrinks pores!! Good for sensitive skin and retina a users;))</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on cleansers and for this one to be my favorite, really surprises me! I am definitely going to repurchase. It does exactly what it says and I love that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Plus, I feel lk it&#x27;s lasted me a while!</li>
    <li> Recently I started using the Loreal Youth Code products and figured why not try the gel cleanser, and am overall satisfied. My face feels clean and soft not overly dry and tight where you have to apply lotion on your face just to get it to feel soft. My skin is both oily in some areas and dry in others and I live in a hot and humid environment, so I have to say again this product is great! You start to see the difference after a good week of constant use, along with using the Youth Code Serum which is great in removing spots that suddenly appear and won&#x27;t go away. My recommendation is try it!</li>
    <li> Cleans my skin w no dryness!  It&#x27;s perfectly balanced to not leave my skin oily but clean and soft. I won&#x27;t use anything else to wash my face, but it&#x27;s hard to find, anymore, in the stores.  Thank God for Amazon online ordering.</li>
    <li> really really good, remove makeup and my face is not dry after cleansing, save a lot of money when buying brand name.  will buy again</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS FACE CLEANSER!!! Tried different ones but this one by far is THE BEST. Doesn&#x27;t dry your skin, feels good. Ashame that it&#x27;s SO HARD to find in stores.</li>
    <li> No way to contact seller other than to return and I don&#x27;t feel like going through the mess...........the product itself is awesome as always but the shipper on the other hand failed to ensure contents didn&#x27;t leak out and my bottle spilled all over my other products</li>
    <li> I like like L&#x60;orel Paris Youth Code Foaming Cleanser. I have tried many other products and have not found anything to meet it&#x60;s standards .I use a complete line of mathing products.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the cleaning ability</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Well, I use all Lóreal products only so this one can never be wrong for me.</li>
