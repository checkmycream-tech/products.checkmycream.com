      <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s an excellent product that moisturizes and detangles, leaving hair soft and</li>
      <li>Smells wonderful and leaves my hair soft and strong!</li>
      <li>absolutely love the scent of the shampoo and conditioner because it is not too strong and reminds me of a relaxing beach vacation!</li>
      <li>To start with, the bottles were huge!  </li>
      <li>Pampering :)</li>
      <li>I absolutely love that both the shampoo and conditioner are paraben and sulfate free!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this shampoo and condition.  </li>
      <li>Both the shampoo and conditioner had a lovely fragrance.  </li>
      <li>There are no caps for the shampoo to come out of, it is just a top that screws off.</li>
      <li>Love the shampoo, and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re careful you will love the product, great results and great fragrance.</li>
      <li>Great product, highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I was looking for a product with no sulfates or parabens, but didn&#x27;t want a product that wouldn&#x27;t lather and also wanted it to be healthy for my hair and color.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love these products.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll buy it again at that price, even though I love how my hair looks and feels.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I only use sufate and paraben free hair products, and this is one of the best ones I have tried to date.</li>
      <li>and I love that it&#x27;s sulfate free</li>
      <li>Both the shampoo and conditioner smell lovely, I really enjoy their scent.</li>
      <li>There is a light beachy smell without being overwhelming</li>
      <li>and since it&#x27;s sulfate and paraben free I know it&#x27;s safe to use.</li>
      <li>The bottles are very smooth and all black and the included pumps are easy to use and perfect for dispensing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These are particularly large bottles that came with pumps, which was nice.</li>
      <li>To begin, the containers are huge so there is no need to worry about running out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve now used for a few days and I agree this stuff is great!</li>
      <li>The pumps actually worked great for me.  </li>
      <li>Amazon is lucky to have such a great distributor/seller on their roster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>give it 5 stars, but this bottle isn&#x27;t user friendly - needs a pump or something.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo is very refreshing and leaves my hair soft, hydrated and clean.</li>
      <li>love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I should mention that I received a discount to provide my open and unbiased opinion, and in my opinion this is a good quality product</li>
      <li>really full.</li>
      <li>The label is beautiful, but the Thread (of Triple Thread) is upside down.</li>
      <li>Since the shampoo contains no sulfates it can&#x27;t adequately remove the silicone, leading to buildup.</li>
      <li>I liked that it does not contain sulfates - after suffering from an itchy scalp for years, I switched to sulfate free shampoos and it has helped the problem immensely.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo lathers amazing, and the conditioner left my hair smooth and manageable.</li>
      <li>I mean, they&#x27;re fine, the best part about both is the scent, but they just work as shampoo and conditioner are really supposed to.</li>
      <li>This was my very first time ordering anything from Triple Thread</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this duo for several days and love the scent and quality!</li>
      <li>It left my hair feeling really soft and it has a light pleasant smell which I like.  </li>
      <li>The pair makes my hair shine, keeps it hydrated and gives my hair a natural healthy look.</li>
      <li>I received this shampoo and conditioner set as a promotion, and although it&#x27;s nice for a deeply discounted price, I don&#x27;t really find anything special about either of these.</li>
      <li>I have fairly thick waist length hair and it takes one pump of the shampoo to give me great lather.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty picky about what I out in my hair.</li>
      <li>I really like this set of shampoo and conditioner!</li>
      <li>The shampoo is a transparent light blue beach water color and smells like sweet coconut beach water.</li>
      <li>I really like this shampoo and conditioner!  </li>
      <li>Triple thread shampoo is amazing my hair felt lustrous and less frizzy after use</li>
      <li>My only misgiving is it didn&#x27;t come with a way to easily get it out of the container.</li>
      <li>, I just don&#x27;t know why companies feel it necessary to put them in perfectly fine products.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it can be hard for me to find a good shampoo and conditioner duo.</li>
      <li>Like I said I had to use it a couple of times to really start to see results</li>
      <li>really don&#x27;t like this product.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this pair for anyone who enjoys the beach and is looking for a hydration hair care duo!</li>
      <li>and i really dislike the smell.  </li>
      <li>I used 4 pumps and it was too much and took me longer to rinse out.</li>
      <li>Product was as described by many of the other reviews..</li>
      <li>However, my hair really felt nice and soft after I blow dried it out.  </li>
      <li>The bottles were HUGE and much heavier than I expected.</li>
      <li>This review is mainly about the seller.</li>
      <li>My hair is soft and not as frizzy as it might be in San Diego with this much humidity.  </li>
      <li>My hair is so soft!</li>
      <li>I really like that they come in big bottles.</li>
      <li>The smell is light and not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>It contains natural oils, such as avocado.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>I am a beach fanatic and I get excited every time I use Triple Thread shampoo and conditioner because it reminds me of the soothing beach waves.</li>
      <li>My hair felt pretty dry after shampooing and the conditioner didn&#x27;t really make it feel much better. :(</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I had to use it a couple of times before I could write a proper review, and now that I have....I love it! Like I said I had to use it a couple of times to really start to see results, so don&#x27;t get mad if it doesn&#x27;t work the first time for you! Smells awesome too!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo and condition.  It has made my hair feel less dry.  It also smells good and is paraben free!</li>
    <li> I bought this for $14.99 and now it&#x27;s $39.99! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy it again at the $14.99 price. My hair felt pretty dry after shampooing and the conditioner didn&#x27;t really make it feel much better. :(</li>
    <li> Triple thread shampoo is amazing my hair felt lustrous and less frizzy after use and since it&#x27;s sulfate and paraben free I know it&#x27;s safe to use.</li>
    <li> This review is for both the Triple Thread hydrating shampoo &amp; conditioner.  To begin, the containers are huge so there is no need to worry about running out. Also they come with pumps, making it easier to use. Some other pros of this product are:&lt;br /&gt;- No parabens or sulfates&lt;br /&gt;- Smells pleasant. There is a light beachy smell without being overwhelming&lt;br /&gt;- It contains natural oils, such as avocado.&lt;br /&gt;- Seems to work on any hair type:  I am growing out my natural hair, so the first few inches can be oily, while the rest is dry and damaged. It moisturized my hair equally well throughout.&lt;br /&gt;- Detangles excellently&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The conditioner contains dimethicone, which is a silicone. Since the shampoo contains no sulfates it can&#x27;t adequately remove the silicone, leading to buildup. This means at some point you will need to use a clarifying shampoo to remove it, or your hair can become dull.&lt;br /&gt;- The label is beautiful, but the Thread (of Triple Thread) is upside down. It isn&#x27;t a big deal, just slightly annoying to read &amp; makes it look less streamlined and professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s an excellent product that moisturizes and detangles, leaving hair soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo and conditioner!  I have thick straight hair that is not colored.  It left my hair feeling really soft and it has a light pleasant smell which I like.  I liked that it does not contain sulfates - after suffering from an itchy scalp for years, I switched to sulfate free shampoos and it has helped the problem immensely.  This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I am so ecstatic about this set! It was much larger than I thought. The pumps actually worked great for me.  I am not sure what the problem was for the other reviewers. Below is a picture of how it came wrappded as well as the pump included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the shampoo with the conditioner, my hair felt amazing!</li>
    <li> Scent could be better but the size is great and I love that it&#x27;s sulfate free</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these products. I&#x27;m really sad that the price shot up from $14.99 to $39.99 in just a few days, though. Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll buy it again at that price, even though I love how my hair looks and feels.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair and it can be hard for me to find a good shampoo and conditioner duo. I usually buy shampoos at organic natural beauty shops because my skin and scalp are very sensitive. This was my very first time ordering anything from Triple Thread and I was thrilled once the package arrived. The bottles were HUGE and much heavier than I expected. The bottles were wrapped together and each bottle came with a pump and a lid. The bottles are very smooth and all black and the included pumps are easy to use and perfect for dispensing. I purchased this item during a one time promotional period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love the scent of the shampoo and conditioner because it is not too strong and reminds me of a relaxing beach vacation! The shampoo is very refreshing and leaves my hair soft, hydrated and clean. The shampoo is a transparent light blue beach water color and smells like sweet coconut beach water. The shampoo has aloe leaf juice which helps heal my hair naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is a creme blue color and has a stronger, sweeter scent than the shampoo. The conditioner has shea butter and avocado oil which both help hydrate my hair, reduce frizz and give my hair nutrients to reduce split ends. I absolutely love that both the shampoo and conditioner are paraben and sulfate free! The duo does not irritate my scalp or skin and I am loving my hydrated long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this duo for several days and love the scent and quality! The pair makes my hair shine, keeps it hydrated and gives my hair a natural healthy look. I am a beach fanatic and I get excited every time I use Triple Thread shampoo and conditioner because it reminds me of the soothing beach waves. I would highly recommend this pair for anyone who enjoys the beach and is looking for a hydration hair care duo!</li>
    <li> I received this shampoo and conditioner set as a promotion, and although it&#x27;s nice for a deeply discounted price, I don&#x27;t really find anything special about either of these. I mean, they&#x27;re fine, the best part about both is the scent, but they just work as shampoo and conditioner are really supposed to. Also there is dyes in both, which I&#x27;m not so against, I just don&#x27;t know why companies feel it necessary to put them in perfectly fine products.&lt;br /&gt;These are particularly large bottles that came with pumps, which was nice. I would buy again, if I didn&#x27;t find something I liked better.</li>
    <li> I really like this set of shampoo and conditioner! They come in huge 33ml bottles with two dispensing pumps which work wonderfully. Both the shampoo and conditioner smell lovely, I really enjoy their scent. I only use sufate and paraben free hair products, and this is one of the best ones I have tried to date. The shampoo lathers amazing, and the conditioner left my hair smooth and manageable. I definitely recommend this set to anyone! I did receive this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review!</li>
    <li> I received this product at a discount in return for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never heard of this brand before and was eager to try it after reading other online reviews of this product.  To start with, the bottles were huge!  You definitely get a generous supply.  Both the shampoo and conditioner had a lovely fragrance.  After using the shampoo and conditioner my hair both felt and smelled really nice!  I loved the texture of my hair after using this product.  Normally (likely because I have blow dried my hair for so long) my hair feels dry even after using conditioner.  However, my hair really felt nice and soft after I blow dried it out.  My daughter who has curly hair also liked using this product as she found it easier to brush out after her hair dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky about what I out in my hair. This is great stuff. I really like that they come in big bottles. It seems as though they will last a long time. I would recommend using only 2 pumps of conditioner max at a time. I used 4 pumps and it was too much and took me longer to rinse out. The smell is light and not overwhelming. My hair looks great and has a nice shine to it. I should mention that I received a discount to provide my open and unbiased opinion, and in my opinion this is a good quality product and I would recommend it to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product with no sulfates or parabens, but didn&#x27;t want a product that wouldn&#x27;t lather and also wanted it to be healthy for my hair and color.  I found it all in this product.  Absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Been using this for 2 months and I&#x27;m loving it! Husband loves it too! Hair is softer and works well with keeping my hair color lasting!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so great!  Pampering :)</li>
    <li> really don&#x27;t like this product. had high hopes but sadly too heavy for my hair and i really dislike the smell.  received today and used tonight when i came in from my workout. fragrance alone will have me giving this away as quickly as possible. that said, good concept, great packaging and prompt shipping in well padded box.  note: i received this product at a discounted price in return for my honest review. these opinions are my own and were not in any way influenced by the price discounting.</li>
    <li> I love this!  I have fairly thick waist length hair and it takes one pump of the shampoo to give me great lather.  The lather has a wonderful woodsy smell to it.  The conditioner takes 3 pumps and also smells great.  My hair is soft and not as frizzy as it might be in San Diego with this much humidity.  Great product, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> The shampoo is unbelievably watery. The scent is just so-so. The conditioner is ok but overall, I am really not impressed. This is bush league stuff.</li>
    <li> Love this product! My hair is so soft!</li>
    <li> Tried a couple of times - my hair is not as manageable as it is using Pureology, and felt like a film on the surface of my hair.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic and a great price!</li>
    <li> Product was as described by many of the other reviews.. Smells great and does make my daughter&#x27;s and my hair softer! This review is mainly about the seller. There was a slight issue, but it was rectified immediately and to the fullest extent. I will definitely purchase from this seller again and again!!! They were courteous and VERY easy to work with. If I could give 10 ★s I would!! Amazon is lucky to have such a great distributor/seller on their roster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OAN:  My purchase did include 2 black pumps.. I didn&#x27;t see a mention of this so, I thought I&#x27;d put it out there!</li>
    <li> Both products, both shampoo and conditioner are very good. The only draw back are the bottles they come in, that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. There are no caps for the shampoo to come out of, it is just a top that screws off. So be careful using it or just transfer the product into a proper shampoo and conditioner container. If you&#x27;re careful you will love the product, great results and great fragrance. I will buy it again now that I know what to expect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve now used for a few days and I agree this stuff is great! My hair is so shiny and&lt;br /&gt;looks really full. My only misgiving is it didn&#x27;t come with a way to easily get it out of the container. My order just came with screw tops and because the bottle has such a wide opening I think it may become to find pump tops. I paid significantly less than it is selling for now.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo, and conditioner.  It was a GREAT deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give it 5 stars, but this bottle isn&#x27;t user friendly - needs a pump or something.  Would still buy it again.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and leaves my hair soft and strong!</li>
