<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This does not smell like the Shalimar I have been using for 30+ years.  Not sure why because everything looks legit.  Perhaps it&#x27;s old?  Won&#x27;t buy here again.</li>
    <li> Mild sweet scent. Unfortunately it got broken .</li>
    <li> shalimar has always been one of my very favorites.  happy to have found it at a fair price...love the smell, and so does my hubby....</li>
    <li> Shalimar has always been my wife&#x27;s favorite cologne. We have been married for almost twenty-two years, and I have brought her Shalimar every year.</li>
    <li> my memory of  Shalimar was better then this.  Not the products fault.  Mine.  It is nice but I don&#x27;t get the positive comments about it like I remember</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Shalimar for years and love it!  Good price too!!</li>
    <li> ok, let me start off by telling you I started wearing this at the ripe young age of 16, and the sent is just wonderful!. Now 20+ years latter the sent has changed and it is not the perfume but my body chemistry. Your body chemistry is what dictates  what smells good on you and what DOES NOT! my husband has always hated this on me; and that is why I still were it. ... when he is not home, and he is never home as he is in the Navy and has been gone for the past 7 years. So before you buy and perfume or cologne, for the love of GOD go to the store and try it..walk around then buy, smell will change during the day</li>
    <li> the woman I gave this to loves it a lot. her favorite cologne.</li>
    <li> Everything was fine.  It&#x27;s a good product and something I use regularly. I have used this for many years and ordered on line when the store where I usually purchase this product was vacated. Very glad I was able to get  this on line.</li>
    <li> I have used this fragrance for the past 50 years.  I love it because it is light and not overwheming for those I am around.</li>
    <li> This is a standard eau de Cologne.  It arrived in its usual packaging undamaged and within a week or so of my order.    My wife and I really like the fragrance of Shalimar, but that is a highly subjective preference.   She also likes Chanel No. 5.</li>
    <li> I have used Shalimar since I was 16 years young. My Dad gave it to me. It was my first Bottle of Perfume and it is still my Favorite All these Years later. The Price is Excellent at Amazon and the Quality is Surpurb. Thank You</li>
    <li> Perfume was as expected. Always good smelling and light.</li>
    <li> This product has been available for years with a loyal following. This dealer has a great price and along with impressive shipping presents one of the \\&quot;buys\\&quot; of the year!</li>
    <li> I buy this product twice a year for my mother.  Her favorite cologne! Not over powering but a wonderful fragrance.</li>
    <li> As advertised - fast delivery.</li>
    <li> This is an older boxed version and I&#x27;ve used it for the past 50 years.  It&#x27;s wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect item given as a gift.</li>
    <li> Everything was as promised</li>
    <li> SHALIMAR HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A VERY LONG TIME...........IT IS THE PERFUME PERFECT FOR ANY WOMAN!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product that my mother has worn for over 4 decades. For a Classy lady this perfume is a must!</li>
    <li> My Mother found Shalimar in the fifties and I started using it as a teenager and the compliments just came my way, from everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Even an \\&quot;old\\&quot; boyfriend sent his wife up to me and she said, \\&quot;that her husband loved the fragrance so much that he insisted that I ask you what the fragrance is so I can go buy some for myself.\\&quot;  Ha ! Forgot me, but not the beautiful fragrance of Shalimar.&lt;br /&gt;I understand that it also comes in \\&quot;Shalimar light\\&quot; which I would really love to try, at my age now, that would probably be a better choice for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I gave a bottle of Shalimar to a dear friend of mine and she still has it.  Hasn&#x27;t been used for 40 years and she just doesn&#x27;t have the heart to discard it,  It was one of my Mom&#x27;s and it is a treasure to her and her memories of days gone by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a legacy for the fragrance and the \\&quot;olfactory memories\\&quot; that are evoked and instantly transform us to the place of \\&quot;our happy days\\&quot; and our youth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary Ann Greenley</li>
    <li> I have used Shalimar for many years and when I found it on Amazon I immediately ordered it because of the price and convenience of not having to run around to find a place to buy it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic cologne for my spouse.............with aprhodisiac qualities!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Shalimar perfume since 1970.  It&#x27;s wonderful to be able to  buy it on line so I don&#x27;t have to walk into a Mall.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite for the wife.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my all-time favorite</li>
    <li> Shalimar has been the only perfume I&#x27;ve worn in more than 20 years.  It is so sensual, nothing can compare.  The price, yes, but it&#x27;s worth every cent!  I get so many comments about what is it, where can I get it (Amazon of course) and so on.  I don&#x27;t know anyone that doesn&#x27;t love it.  Hooked for life!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this perfume.  I get lots of compliments on this.  Price was very reasonable compared to purchasing it at a department store.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and in perfect condition. This has been my favorite fragrance for many, many years.  A subtle, pleasant aroma.</li>
    <li> Heady stuff! Very evocative!</li>
    <li> This has always been my favorite scent but the scent does not seem to last very long.</li>
    <li> The spray goes on beautifully but the scent fades rapidly .  Seems as if the product isnt the same as it was say 15 years ago..people dont notice the scent like they used too</li>
    <li> Shalimar is the only cologne I have used for many years.  I have never found anything to compete with it.</li>
    <li> MOMA LOVES IT,IF MOMA IS HAPPY ALLS WELL</li>
    <li> I have used Shalimar for years and request it for a gift whenever my family needs a suggestion for me. It was priced very reasonably and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Seems a little weaker than the Shalimar purchased at the store, but it is good enough to keep. I wonder how many people buy, dilute and return.</li>
    <li> This fragrance has spicy-vanilla overtones which last for 6 - 8 hours. I receive pleasant compliments from both sexes at all times.</li>
    <li> I usually buy this product either at my mall&#x27;s department store or at the swap meet at the specialty perfume store when they can get it at a good price.  However,lately the department store prices have become outrageous and the swap meet went out of business. Someone suggested Amazon.com and there was this exact perfect bottle at a great price!!! True, I did have to look around for the best price but when I found it, it was wonderful and I was thrilled. Will definitely order again.  Thank you Amazon!!</li>
    <li> I have not owned this particular scent in several years and it is hard to find in stores. The scent is not quite as I remember and therefore I am somewhat disappointed.I am using it and the bottle is pretty.</li>
    <li> I have used Shalimar for years and was very happy with the price and the delivery. Would most likely buy it  again.</li>
    <li> every thing was a+ including shipping</li>
    <li> I discovered shalimar 33 yrs. ago and I have never worn anything else. It is not heavy like the new fragrances. My brother hates all perfume but actually loves this. Highly recommended!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 60 years old and this has been my only fragrance since age 16.  So glad I&#x27;ve found it here as the department stores charge too much.</li>
    <li> El producto llegó perfectamente sellado, el frasco es original y para ser agua de colonia tiene un olor perdurable. Agradezco que cuando tenga agua de perfume o perfume, me avise porque me interesaría comprarlo.    Gracias</li>
    <li> the only thing I wear!  I&#x27;m 80 and have used it all my life.  Love it.  Aught to get a free bottle, don&#x27;t you think!</li>
    <li> Good product...good price.  Product was as expected.  I have used Shalimar for over 40 years and get compliments all the time still on how good I smell...LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I love this scent and have been wearing it since I was a teenager,</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Shalimar.</li>
    <li> I have been using Shalimar for 53 years and I love it!</li>
    <li> Great price for half the amount the AFB sells it for.</li>
    <li> WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT A COLOGNE SO NICE. I LOVE IT AND HAVE FOR&lt;br /&gt;A LONG TIME. THE PRICE IS A LITTLE HIGH, BUT IT IS TO BE EXPECTED.&lt;br /&gt;NOT A NICER COLOGNE.</li>
    <li> Love Shalimar!!  Have been using it for years and never want to be without it.</li>
    <li> My wife favourite !!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Shalimar. Classic, classey, perfection. To me, this is the gold standard for perfumes. Pure elegance in the traditional Shalimar bottle, but with a spray pump.</li>
    <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t  last very long like it did before.  I am very disappointed .</li>
    <li> Great price for the size of the bottle. A perfume that has been around for a long time and still love it.</li>
    <li> I had not bought it in a long time. This has always been my favorite perfume I just couldnt afford it. But I decided to splurge on me.&lt;br /&gt;I bought ot for my Birthday.</li>
    <li> Old school but lovely. A tad heavy so a little goes a long way. I won&#x27;t be wearing it in the warmer weather.</li>
    <li> My favorite for fifty years!</li>
    <li> A lady in the hallway smelled so good I asked her what kind of perfume she was wearing.  She told me Shalimar and that she had been wearing it for years. She smelled like soap (fresh out of the shower).  When it arrived I put in on and YUCK!  It smells like old woman... Ewwww and it looks like I will not be able to return it because supposedly it has to be disposed of in a certain matter.  This smells horrible!</li>
    <li> I keep trying other Colognes, because I don&#x27;t want to get in a rut.  I find other Cologne I like, but nothing I enjoy as much as Shalimar.  I am a big believer in change - I change my clothes, hair color, all forms of style, and I don&#x27;t necessarily enjoy being &amp;#34;tagged&amp;#34; with one Cologne.  BUT I love this one SO much that I keep returning to it.  It&#x27;s softer with vanilla notes.  The cologne stays &amp;#34;lightly&amp;#34; with you and is not overpowering.  I may change up a LOT in my life, but this is a timeless classic.  Please let me know if you have any questions because I would be glad to answer them.</li>
    <li> Come beautifully boxed and smells very good!! Sprayed it on the moment I opened the box! Great Price too. Love.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been very happy with this perfume and have ordered it many times before this time it just doesn&#x27;t smell the same and it doesn&#x27;t smell as good as it should</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift....  She Liked it !!!  Classic Cologne.</li>
    <li> I have worn Shalamar for over 40 years and this is the place I could get the original.  Most shops are selling the new light Shalamar and it is not the same.  I feel better when I wear the original although I know Gerlain is phasing out and going to the light formula.  I guess the whole world has to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a clean fresh sent you should try this fragerance.</li>
    <li> Must be a &amp;#34;knock-off&amp;#34; because the cologne does not hold it&#x27;s aroma for more than 5 minutes.  Even when my husband gets very close he can&#x27;t tell that I&#x27;ve put it on--and Shalimar has been his favorite for years.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> My very favorite fragrance in the whole world. All I ever use! So happy to get for such a great price and so quickly!</li>
    <li> Bought it on a whim.  It is the the best Eau De Cologne I have ever purchased.  Very little goes a long way.  I will reorder.</li>
    <li> Have been using Shalimar for years.  Always excellent.  Great buy.  Highly recommend this fragrance for both every day use and for nighttime.</li>
    <li> I have loved Shalimar forever, and I was out. I was hoping  that a local store would have it on sale and waited as long as I could. But when Amazon had it almost $10 cheaper, I had to jump at the chance.  I ordered it for myself, because I&#x27;m worth it, and my husband is too much of a boob to buy me anything. (Wonderful in lots of other ways, but a bood none the less). If you love Shalimar, go for it!</li>
    <li> I have worn this cologne for more than 40 years....It is wonderful...</li>
    <li> Obviously I love the fragrance but unfortunately it does not always come fresh or even particularly fragrant. This bottle smells exactly as it should - fabulous!</li>
    <li> My usual fragrance, at the best price ever.  Will buy again.  Thanks so much, great buy, will buy again, and</li>
    <li> I am sure the product is fine, but I purchased as a gift and the person is allergic to this particular fragrance.  I didn&#x27;t realize that it couldn&#x27;t be returned?  It is unopened and available.</li>
    <li> got this for my wife for Christmas. This is what she wears and always smells good, the price was right as this is getting harder to find.</li>
    <li> I have used Shalimar for years. Delivery is very quick and it&#x27;s priced well.</li>
    <li> Wife&#x27;s favorite - quickly delivered - good price...</li>
    <li> the most exquisite perfum...</li>
    <li> Mom loves it and it&#x27;s hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> An excellent gift for your loved one. This gentle scent is perfect for all occasions. This particular size has the perfect price tag.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a gift for my wife and I am very disappointed.I just received the bottle today, but the bottle is completely damaged. The nozzle is missing, and the bottle is leaking. The smell is very nice though.i am attaching a picture with the review.</li>
    <li> Was everything I wanted in Shalimar.</li>
    <li> She smells good! what can I say?</li>
    <li> I always buy Shalimar, its my favorate !</li>
    <li> My mother-in-law loves this perfume,I bout it for her for a great deal,it was expensive everywhere else,but she loved it! And I would buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> Great price and arrived quickly</li>
    <li> I do LOVE my SHALIMAR.  The only Cologne which I have used in the last 40 years.  The Vanilla scent is light - yet enduring and endearing.  I receive compliments when dining out - or, in the grocery check-out line.  Be noticed via an Awesome Aroma.</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my wife many many years ago. She has used it ever since. This is a pleasant fragrance that is not over-bearing. and obviously, doesn&#x27;t grow old.</li>
    <li> Of all the colognes, this one stays on the longest.  Have used it for over 40 years now and have no regrets.  The cologne stays on the longest, not perfume, etc.  The scent is beautiful.</li>
    <li> HAVE BEEN WEARING SHALIMAR SINCE I WAS 20 AND I AM NOW 65.  MY HUSBAND LOVES IT AND SO DO MY FRIENDS.  VERY RICH AND LUXURIOUS, CHARLIZE THERON SHOULD TRY IT, SURE SHE WOULD LOVE IT TOO.</li>
    <li> fast service and great product</li>
    <li> Everyone has a fragrance that suits them.  My husband loves this on me</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s (and my) favorite cologne. She wore this when we first met and began dating.</li>
    <li> Shalimar By Guerlain For Women. Eau De Cologne Spray, is one of the most wonderful fragrances ever created. It blends with ones&#x27; own body chemistry and produces on the individual wearer, a uniquely personal and beautiful fragrance. I have worn Shalimar  for years and have had so many compliments on it. I wear all fragrances in moderation so as not to be over powering. Shalimar is my personal favorite and is my mainstay. I rarely ever try anything else.&lt;br /&gt;Marilyee Dowling</li>
    <li> I received my Shalimar in a short time and it was packaged very well.  I had no problems with any aspect of this purchase.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Oldie but goodie. Soft vanilla fragrance. Well priced. Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Great deal on my favorite scent! The only downfall was that even after paying extra for faster shipping, it took longer to get. Otherwise incredibly happy.</li>
    <li> It is just what I expected, arrived on time, and in great condition.  I am very pleased.  It was a gift and she likes it.</li>
    <li> Shalimar what can I say The wife loves it and so do I. Its a fragrance that you never tired of.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this for many, many years and was happy to find it at Amazon for a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I love my Shalimar By Guerlain For Women. Eau De Cologne i have been wearing it for 50 years to match it.  There is nothing as far as i am concern that can match it.  Once again thank you. BUT I NEVER RECEIVED MY SHALIMAR BY GUERLAIN FOR WOMEN SENSUAL MILKY VEIL FOR THE BODY.</li>
    <li> Many thanks for the fast delivery of the perfume, which arirrived in excellent condition. The packaging is very good / excellent. IU would recommend this perfume for those who really enjoy the classic perfumes. As to Shalimar, I would especially recommend the EAU DE COLOGNE formula, because it has some velvety &amp; mystery chic in it, and not as harsh as even the EDP or EDT versions of it.</li>
    <li> Great price thanks great perfume have used it for years</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Shalimar Eau De Cologne for at least 30 years.  It is lighter than the perfume and, when used sparingly, has a soft floral/spice scent.  It is classic and sophisticated. My grand children will think about Grammy Mom when they catch a whiff of this scent long after I&#x27;m gone.  I use it to create olfactory memories.</li>
    <li> This has continued to be my favorite perfume for a whole lifetime. It&#x27;s hard to find these days in stores. No one seems to carry fine perfume around here, so it was nice to find it on Amazon for as good a price as I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife.She has worn this for years.Excellent quality and a great price.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this perfume for so many years. It is a classic and it never goes out of style.</li>
    <li> This is the only Cologne I use and it&#x27;s very expensive in stores. This price was wonderful and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> Shalimar is my all time favorite and that of my wife of more than 55 years!  The price and delivery was great.</li>
    <li> Was not able to find Shalimar for several months.  So glad it is back and thought that the price was good.</li>
    <li> Mom loves it.  It was half the price of the department store for double the amount of the same exact product.</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect....time, boxing, &amp; product.</li>
    <li> I use Shalimar  since 40 years and it still makes my day !</li>
    <li> This is one of only a handful of perfumes that does not set off my ashma.  Love the smell and everyone who smells says I just love your perfume.</li>
    <li> I have used Shalimar since I was a teen. I usually buy it in the Caribbean but we sold our home there.  Its nice to have a place to buy it. It is the real stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m enjoying my Shalimar very much❤️</li>
    <li> My mom loves this perfume and it&#x27;s at a reasonable price too!</li>
    <li> Great product and fantastic price.  Another Amazon seller who takes care of and appreciates their customers.</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne; I have been wearing it for over 40 years!</li>
    <li> Will buy again quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Hated the smell. Did not smell anything like perfume. Not the Shalimar I have purchased in department stores and used in the past.</li>
    <li> I always order Shalimar.  A little secret.  I always have a back up.  Never want to be out and you can keep it in the bottom drawer of your fridge and it keep[s forever.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS PURCHASED AS A GRAB BAG GIFT. JEAN WAS VERY HAPPY TO RECEIVE HER GRAB BAG GIFT..SHE WENT OVER THE LIMIT BUT WAS SURPRISED TO RECEIVE THE COLOGNE</li>
    <li> My favorite for over 30 years. my husband had begun to have a hard time finding it until I found it online - we are thrilled!  and the price is good too.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume.  I will always get this for myself till the day I die,LOVE,  LOVE, LOVE ,LOVE</li>
    <li> I have come to loce the Shalimar fragrance ann the various products from their line.  Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensice.</li>
    <li> My wife has used Shalimar for 30 years. A few years ago, they reformulated it. The way you know it&#x27;s the new formulation is if the box is blue. The old formulation was in a gold box. Alas, now, it seems that all the old formulation has long been sold out. My wife says this new formulation is ALMOST as good. It&#x27;s still her favorite fragrance. Even though I&#x27;m not a huge fan of perfume smell, I like it too.</li>
    <li> my  favorite!!! glad I can still find it at a good price. Thank you....</li>
    <li> Met all expectations!</li>
    <li> worn this scent for years...love it</li>
    <li> This is my grandma&#x27;s favorite perfume.  It always has been.  It was a gift for her 93rd birthday.</li>
    <li> The price was excellent and it was the real thing! I&#x27;ve been disappointed from other vendors before as it didn&#x27;t really smell like Shalimar.</li>
    <li> My wife loves its subtle fragrance.  I got it as a gift for her.. After 43 years of marriage, I have learned you are always ahead when you give the girls what they want.. (if humanly possible ;)  )</li>
    <li> An old favorite of mine.  I actually purchased it by mistake - I meant to purchase Cinnabar - another old favorite of mine.  Nevertheless, I kept it because I really like it.</li>
    <li> Wife was very happy with the shalimar. Seemed like a very far price and was packeged well. Received in fair time and would do again.&lt;br /&gt;Craig</li>
    <li> I got for my mother, for Mother&#x27;s Day. She loves it! Macy&#x27;s wanted more than what it&#x27;s sold for here.</li>
    <li> So nice to find this on line.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my wife.  Not for any special occasion, but because she prefers this perfume and always has.  Rightfully so, because this is one of those rare fragrances that has more than just a good &#x27;smell&#x27;.  Because of its chemistry, once applied it lasts a long time, but without changing its fragrance &#x27;character&#x27; over the hours.  It also doesn&#x27;t come across as just plain powerful, so as to make a  &#x27;statement&#x27;, and fill a room full of smell.  It&#x27;s not flowery, nor fruity, nor even &#x27;extra spicey&#x27;, nor any one of another descriptor that applies to a lot of perfumes on the market, especially those that are named for or after some well known Hollywood-type woman.  This fragrance has class on its own, and the chemists who devised or invented it stand well ahead of the other stuff on the market competing for your money.</li>
    <li> Love that I got a classic smell back at a reasonable price. Worth the wait after years of going without it.</li>
    <li> Purchased 2 of these and there is no fragrance.  Color is also not quite right.  As some people have not had this problem, I would suggest that you open bottle to check immediately.  I did not and now it&#x27;s too late to return.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a very long time.  I received my order quickly and the price was great.</li>
    <li> I have worn this for over 30 years and I still get compliments.  I recently purchased this from another site thinking Shalimar is Shalimar but I was wrong. The smell just wasn&#x27;t 100% spot on. I was happy that this time my purchase was perfect.  It smelled the way it should and the price was comparable to what I usually pay at a discount place. Good price and great product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think this smelled totally like the Shalimar that I have worn for over 30 years.  It&#x27;s a little stronger and more floral.  I wonder, every time I spray it, if it&#x27;s really Guerlain.</li>
    <li> Love it. Have used it for years and still love the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Product is as presented. Very happy with cologne</li>
    <li> I got it for my mother, and she loves this stuff. She used to wear the old Fendi perfume, but they stopped making it so this was her 2nd choice. The perfume was shipped on time to her house, and I received a big hug from my mom when I came to visit from out of town.</li>
    <li> My mother always wore Shalimar.  She&#x27;s long passed and now I&#x27;ve found Shalimar on Amazon. And at a good price which my mother would have loved!!  It&#x27;s a delicate and beautiful fragrance that brings back sweet memories.</li>
    <li> I have been using Shalimar exclusively for 60 years and still love it.  My mother gave me my first bottle and she had been using it for years.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent and it came as advertised.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne.  It is exactly as advertised -- and delivered quickly.  Price is great.  I purchased from this seller for Shalimar last year and will continue to so whenever I need this cologne.  Reasonable and quick--Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume!  It smells sooooo good!!!  I was sad when the bottle I had ran dry, but was elated when I found this bottle to purchase!</li>
    <li> THIS PERFUME HAS BEEN MY FAVORITE FOR YEARS AND MY WIFE LOVES IT TOO. I BUY A BOTTLE FOR HER &amp; ME AS AN ADDED GIFT FOR ALL SPECIAL OCCASIONS.</li>
    <li> my all time favorite I have used it for years and years. Love it!</li>
