<li> For me, and for the few people I have had try them, they work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Besides the fact that this product is extremely overpriced, it arrived stale and falling apart.</li>
<li> Dont waste your money!!</li>
<li> For anyone who has been on Atkins, you know this means bad breath and foul body odor as the body excretes ketones.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed.</li>

    <li> I didn&#x27;t experience long lasting fresh breath.</li>
    <li> very refreshing,and yummy</li>
    <li> Deffinately love these, have used since they were called &amp;#34;Breathe Asure&amp;#34; in the late 90&#x27;s. Great for unexpected meetings or refreshers in between meals.</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping, instead of Taking 3 take 4 works better</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and years. They are effective, and I love the flavor and the effect they have on my stomach. I love spicy food -- I never hold back on the garlic! -- so I appreciate that these can dissipate the odor that emanates through the pores.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling for years with breath problems from my hiatial hernia.  Mint assure is the one of MANY products that I have tried that actually works!</li>
    <li> Doesnt work at all! Dont waste your money!!</li>
    <li> I love these mints! They really do freshen your breath fantastically! Can&#x27;t find these in stores and am glad I could find them here....Thank you!</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t work for everyone, but they work for most people I know who I have suggested use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update October 11, 2016- I started the Atkins diet. For anyone who has been on Atkins, you know this means bad breath and foul body odor as the body excretes ketones. Ick. Double ick. I have job interviews to attend and I can&#x27;t show up smelling like a cesspit. These are helping keep my body odor free. My only negative thought about them is the coating flakes off if they are stored long term or banged around in a purse. It doesn&#x27;t lessen their effect, but it does make them a bit messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These work on me by removing the smell of onions or alcohol seeping out my pores and my breath. I take a dose before stinky food or drink and then again around two hours later. I generally take three doses the first day then another dose the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some meals that are full of onions and garlic. I don&#x27;t want to smell like sour onions or garlic for three days. These help resolve the issue. Most of the time these pills can at least lessen the smell exuding from my pores and stop the bad breath. For me, and for the few people I have had try them, they work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They saved at least one relationship I had where the man had a major problem with eating onions or garlic. He could come home after eating those for lunch and I would smell it on his skin. Not on his breath, literally on his skin. The Mint Asure helped keep that from happening and within around an hour of taking the pills, the smell exuding from him would lessen.  I have been a fan of these since they were called &amp;#34;Breath Assure&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new mint coating does make them harder to take without water, but taking them with water seems to help get them into the system faster so I don&#x27;t mind it. I don&#x27;t find that the mint coating does much to freshen breath on it&#x27;s own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know why they work, but I am glad they do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sticky stuff added to the capsules is a bonus, suck it off then swallow. I can dry swallow many pills but these need liquid to swallow. They work fast, within an hour on me.apsules is a bonus, suck it off then swallow. I can dry swallow many pills but these need liquid to swallow. They work fast, within an hour on me.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for years but you can&#x27;t find them in the stores anywhere. This products works well no matter what you eat and I also use at night after a good meal. It prevents the food taste from reoccurring at bedtime plus I don&#x27;t wake up with fowl breath. True story :)</li>
    <li> These keep breathe smelling fresh.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years. Great product.</li>
    <li> PERFECT!  GOOD PRODUCT. THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> i am a very satisfied customer. Thank you for your merchandise.</li>
    <li> I really like this breath freshener.  I feel confident using it.</li>
    <li> So far it works well I drink tea often and I don&#x27;t have tea breath anymore</li>
    <li> Good product, arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and was exactly what I expected. Everything was perfect.</li>
    <li> Keeps breath fresh and settles the stomach.</li>
    <li> Product was as advertised and delivery was prompt as promised.</li>
    <li> Was fine...competitive with others</li>
    <li> Helps get rid of onion or garlic breath.</li>
    <li> Good product, good service, everything FAST - THANKS...</li>
    <li> So far I love these! Been using for about 2 weeks now. No complaints! They work well!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t sleep in the same room as my husband after he uses garlic dressing unless he takes a few of these with his meal!!</li>
    <li> I just realized that some capsules are missing.....</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Wish it was still available in local pharmacies.  Seller provided it in a time;y manner.  No complaints</li>
    <li> great for use as a pre medication for garlic or onion containing foods, not only for breath but for indigestion.</li>
    <li> AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sucked on just one of these pills before going to sleep, and I did NOT brush my teeth, and i honestly woke up with fresh breath, I couldn&#x27;t believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things taste great when you suck on them.  they freshen your breath a bit even before you ingest them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is you have to try to stop yourself from chewing them.  they have a chewy fruit snack texture that makes you want to take a bite, but that aint allowed.</li>
    <li> Besides the fact that this product is extremely overpriced, it arrived stale and falling apart. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it, doesn&#x27;t worth the money</li>
    <li> Great product! Meets my expectations.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Worked instantly!</li>
    <li> These breath mints work very well.  Definitely will purchase these again.</li>
    <li> As expected.  Good experience.</li>
    <li> I will buy this product again.</li>
