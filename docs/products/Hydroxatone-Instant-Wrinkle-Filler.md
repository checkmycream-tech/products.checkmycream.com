      <li>, I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to pay for it!</li>
      <li>good product i love it</li>
      <li>I could have done better with a caulking gun to fill my wrinkles in.  </li>

      <li>I need an industrial strength crack filler at my age, and I ordered this one with great expectations and so far has not performed.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok but doesn&#x27;t make me awfully excited.</li>
      <li>I got this free when I ordered Hydroxatone awhile ago.  </li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t notice any significant change at all.</li>
      <li>So the \\&quot;Our #1 Priority is Customer Satisfaction!!\\&quot; is not quite true.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t work miracles and only lasts a couple of hours but all in all good product</li>
      <li>Overall, I would say this is a good product.</li>

      <li>I was glad to finally get this item after a few delays, and I am happy with it.  </li>
      <li>I do notice that the lines are more visible by the end of the day, so it is only a temporary fix, but I&#x27;ll take it!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a problem with it &#x27;sitting on top&#x27; or making a white film.  </li>
      <li>It went on nice however within a half hour</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m almost willing to try buying one and playing around with how much is needed vs too much.....</li>
      <li>Maybe I put too much on??  </li>
      <li>I have naturally oily skin, plus I use a day lotion on my face before putting makeup on, so maybe that&#x27;s been the trick.</li>
      <li>I used this product for months and did not see any noticeable results as far as wrinkles or smoothness in my skin.</li>
      <li>I definitely see a difference with the smile lines, and a tiny bit of difference on the frown lines.  </li>
      <li>I paid too much the last time, but will check one out at a later date.</li>
      <li>It is far from instant.  </li>

<li> It is far from instant.  </li>
<li> Every little bit helps, and it is fun to feel that you have made some improvement, no matter how slight!</li>
<li> I instantly saw these forehead lines smoothed considerably when I rubbed a small amount of the Hydroxatone Instant Wrinkle Filler on them.</li>
<li> I am old and my wrinkles are here to stay, but I think this product does soften them a little.  </li>
<li> Does work wonders in the immediacy, but left a white, flaky residue after it dried.  </li>
<li> That&#x27;s possible, though the sample size was quite small...</li>
<li> it is hard to apply in a criss cross fashion if you cannot get it on your face!  </li>
<li> Yes, you see a noticable difference in wrinkles when you put it on, but after it sits on your face for a moment it becomes a hard, white paste.  </li>
<li> Was messy, gooey, and visible.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure I could have applied it with a putty knife.</li>
<li> Lousy it leaves like a white film on your skin and the make up will not cover it up</li>
<li> I have very few wrinkles, but do have some forehead lines that are hereditary and bothersome.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if I just received a &#x27;bad&#x27; or &#x27;old&#x27; tube</li>
<li> , this is another company making miracle claims and charging ridiculous amounts of money for their products that are (and I say this after using the cream for 4 months) sub-par.</li>
<li> Also, I read some reviews stating that this product leaves behind a white-like film.</li>
<li> I tried to follow the directions but the silly stuff wouldn&#x27;t leave my finger!  </li>
<li> I was disappointed with this product.</li>

    <li> This product helps to fill in some of the wrinkles only temporarily.  It is a good addition to your bag of makeup tricks.  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this product. I purchased it for the deep wrinkles around the corners of my mouth and I didn&#x27;t notice any significant change at all.</li>
    <li> I tried to follow the directions but the silly stuff wouldn&#x27;t leave my finger!  it is hard to apply in a criss cross fashion if you cannot get it on your face!  I&#x27;m not sure I could have applied it with a putty knife. LOL!  I don&#x27;t know if I just received a &#x27;bad&#x27; or &#x27;old&#x27; tube but when I initially contacted mutysdeals and asked how I could return the product as I felt it was not as advertised, I was told they do not accept &#x27;used&#x27; product.  So the \\&quot;Our #1 Priority is Customer Satisfaction!!\\&quot; is not quite true. Oh well.....I guess the bear got me today.</li>
    <li> I need an industrial strength crack filler at my age, and I ordered this one with great expectations and so far has not performed. It sits on top. Can&#x27;t determine whether that is what is intended. It&#x27;s ok but doesn&#x27;t make me awfully excited. I don&#x27;t wear makeup on top. I have ordered other products from this line to give the brand a fair assessment.</li>
    <li> I was glad to finally get this item after a few delays, and I am happy with it.  I am old and my wrinkles are here to stay, but I think this product does soften them a little.  Every little bit helps, and it is fun to feel that you have made some improvement, no matter how slight!</li>
    <li> I got this free when I ordered Hydroxatone awhile ago.  Tried it once, put it in the makeup drawer and there it still sits.  Yes, you see a noticable difference in wrinkles when you put it on, but after it sits on your face for a moment it becomes a hard, white paste.  And don&#x27;t even think about applying makeup over it.  You&#x27;ll get a concoction that resembles cornstarch and water.  I have to say, all in all, this is another company making miracle claims and charging ridiculous amounts of money for their products that are (and I say this after using the cream for 4 months) sub-par.</li>
    <li> I can definitely tell a difference on my face after application of this product. Not only does it smoothes, but it also brightens. It&#x27;s an instant lift!</li>
    <li> Received a sample in the mail yesterday and applied today....Does work wonders in the immediacy, but left a white, flaky residue after it dried.  I had to wash the stuff off.  Maybe I put too much on??  That&#x27;s possible, though the sample size was quite small...still, that could&#x27;ve been the problem.  I&#x27;m almost willing to try buying one and playing around with how much is needed vs too much.....I said \\&quot;almost\\&quot;....I&#x27;ll sleep on it!</li>
    <li> I did not like this product at all. I sent it back.  It is far from instant.  I could have done better with a caulking gun to fill my wrinkles in.  It went on nice however within a half hour I put my hand on my forehead and it was coming off.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used this product for months and did not see any noticeable results as far as wrinkles or smoothness in my skin.</li>
    <li> I use this product almost every day.It  is perfect alone or under makeup .  Fills in the fines lines around lips.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a problem with it &#x27;sitting on top&#x27; or making a white film.  I take a tiny bit, rub it between two fingers and do the cross hatch application.  I&#x27;ve used this on my frown lines and smile lines...I definitely see a difference with the smile lines, and a tiny bit of difference on the frown lines.  I guess it works OK, I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to pay for it!</li>
    <li> Was messy, gooey, and visible.  I won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
    <li> Lousy it leaves like a white film on your skin and the make up will not cover it up oh well</li>
    <li> I had received a sample of this product in the mail and months later decided to give it a try. I have very few wrinkles, but do have some forehead lines that are hereditary and bothersome. I instantly saw these forehead lines smoothed considerably when I rubbed a small amount of the Hydroxatone Instant Wrinkle Filler on them. I was amazed! I do notice that the lines are more visible by the end of the day, so it is only a temporary fix, but I&#x27;ll take it! Also, I read some reviews stating that this product leaves behind a white-like film. This hasn&#x27;t been the case for me. I have naturally oily skin, plus I use a day lotion on my face before putting makeup on, so maybe that&#x27;s been the trick. Overall, I would say this is a good product.</li>
    <li> As good as any wrinkles filler.  Can&#x27;t work miracles and only lasts a couple of hours but all in all good product</li>
    <li> I will no doubt be ordering something at a later date. I paid too much the last time, but will check one out at a later date.</li>
    <li> good product i love it i see diffrents in 5 minutes i will recomend hydroxatone to my friends and family</li>
