      <li>I had been using Nizoral with great success for a year now.  </li>
      <li>so I use a finishing glosser that makes my hair appear more groomed and helps it to stay in place without hair spray.  </li>
      <li>I love the minty smell.</li>
      <li>It tangles my hair more.  </li>

      <li>Also, I have copper color in my hair which fades really quickly, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to make it fade any faster than any other shampoo which is a good thing.</li>
      <li>But, it&#x27;s worth using just on the scalp.  </li>

      <li>The Bosley Conditioner and Shampoo Stopped My Hair From Shedding and Leaves It Soft and Easy To Comb and Manage</li>

      <li>The most important thing I notice is that my hair loss is less, coming out more slowly.  </li>
      <li>The only problem is the tiny slits in the shampoo and conditioner top...</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is not heavy either.  </li>
      <li>When I use this it tends to make my scalp very warm especially where the hair is the thinnest.....but  not an uncomfortable warmth.....</li>
      <li>The same product my  beautician uses and I can see new growth each week that I have used  it --for about three years, total..</li>
      <li>My hair is thick, shiny, bouncy and full - I get a ton of compliments.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> No problems! Everything went smoothly!</li>
    <li> I ordered this conditioner because I had used it for two months before and really liked it. I think it helps with volume. I love the minty smell.In several months of use, I cannot say it has helped to regrow any hair. It was much cheaper here than getting it from my salon.</li>
    <li> One of the nice things was, that the Product arrived very soon. I think, the Conditioner is quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely get it again.</li>
    <li> used this for years - just buying on line now. really works</li>
    <li> Used conditioner faithfully for about 2 months. Hair is still thinning. Product did not help my thinning color treated hair.</li>
    <li> Good produce of Bosley&#x27;s. I would like it to volumize my hair more than it does.</li>
    <li> No sulfates. Good volumizing conditioner.</li>
    <li> This product has helped to slow my hair loss.  Thankfully.</li>
    <li> This really does work!  It is not heavy either.  I use it with the thickening treatment.  It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS, I WILL BUY AGAIN!!</li>
    <li> I have been using the shampoo and conditioner for several months.  The most important thing I notice is that my hair loss is less, coming out more slowly.  Hair is also thicker and fuller and easier to style and manage.  It seems a bit drying so I use a finishing glosser that makes my hair appear more groomed and helps it to stay in place without hair spray.  I also use Biotin 5000 mg a day which I think in combination with the Bosley products makes a huge difference in slowing the hair loss process.</li>
    <li> Left my hair in good condition. Easier to use. White hair beautifully shiny. Received lots of compliments. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Gave me thick, pretty hair for the first time since leaving my 20&#x27;s behind..it&#x27;s like magic.  I&#x27;ve even stopped using hair-thickening shampoo.  Nice light scent; you don&#x27;t have to use much.  Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Have been using it for 3 months and the results are consistent (my hair doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;get used\\&quot; to the product and revert to its old bad ways, as has happened with other products).  My hair is thick, shiny, bouncy and full - I get a ton of compliments.  I dye my hair (as well as having thinning hair), so it has in the past looked like a bad wig... this product makes my hair look like hair again.  Can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough!</li>
    <li> Works great at controlling frizzies and making hair look like it has more volume. Best conditioner I&#x27;ve used. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I do like this a lot, it seems to make my thinning hair fuller.....But I do switch this periodically with other hair treatments.  When I use this it tends to make my scalp very warm especially where the hair is the thinnest.....but  not an uncomfortable warmth.....when you rinse it off it is then fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Nioxin in the past but decided to try something new this past month. I ordered this conditioner and liked the results. When using Nioxin my hair tends to look really dull, but with this conditioner my hair has been shiny and easy to detangle, this stuff is great.</li>
    <li> It tangles my hair more.  It &amp; the mousse make my hair like straw.  I have gone back to my Tresomme conditioner &amp; detangler.</li>
    <li> I like the Bosley products and usually the products arrive in good condition. This time, however, the shampoo had leaked out and was under the shrink wrap on the bottle. Not my usual experience with Amazon.</li>
    <li> If you have thinning hair and hair loss like I do, you will love this product. It really makes my hair look a lot fuller. It also gives your scalp that tingling feeling when product is actually on...it just makes me feel like it&#x27;s doing something great.</li>
    <li> This product did arrive just as it said it would, however the part about being for color treated hair, NOT after using this item and the shampoo one time it stripped most of the color out of my recently colored hair.</li>
    <li> Bosley hair care products used as directed are effective . It seems to slow down hair loss. I would recommend it to anyone with  a similar problem.</li>
    <li> This is a repeat order.  I have used this product for at least 2 years and it works great.  I use it along with Bosley Visibly Thinning hair shampoo.  My hair started to thicken up in the first month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Products!</li>
    <li> The same product my  beautician uses and I can see new growth each week that I have used  it --for about three years, total..</li>
    <li> The only problem is the tiny slits in the shampoo and conditioner top...the product gets stuck and needs to be cleaned out.  I see a difference in my hair, and I do really like it</li>
    <li> I had been using Nizoral with great success for a year now.  I have a sore scalp, followed by hair loss.  I was diagnosed with chronic telogen effluvium, seborrheic dermatitis (although I never scale or flake at all) and androgenetic alopecia.  The other shampoo is all of a sudden impossible to find so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  I&#x27;ve tried all other salycilic acid shampoos, ketoconazole, zinc, etc and none work for me.  This shampoo does take the soreness away if I use it every day, so it must be working somewhat.  None of the other shampoos even help with soreness.  I have yet to see any regrowth, but it&#x27;s only been about 2 months.  I will say that I only use this product on my scalp and not the rest of my hair because I don&#x27;t like the way it makes my hair feel.  I am used to using Redken and Pureology and this shampoo leaves my hair feeling dried out and makes it look like I have split ends when I use it on the rest of my hair.  But, it&#x27;s worth using just on the scalp.  Also, I have copper color in my hair which fades really quickly, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to make it fade any faster than any other shampoo which is a good thing.</li>
    <li> I am sorry it took so long to reply&lt;br /&gt;It is agreta product and my hair is growing back&lt;br /&gt;and if full.&lt;br /&gt;thank yu so much ...great product&lt;br /&gt;carol whitson</li>
    <li> amazing stuff !! Will keep buying....  I&#x27;ve now bought this product for the second time and I do refer to friends and others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alicia Joslin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years and like how the hair looks and feels. I have fine and frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I have only used the product for a week, however, my hair &amp;#34;looks thicker&amp;#34; and it seems to be falling out less. I will write more in a month.</li>
    <li> Very good product. I like the way my hair feels afterwards. I like the tingling in my scalp and together with Biotin it seems to be helping with my hair loss. My hair was thinning on the temples and bang area.</li>
    <li> The Bosley Conditioner and Shampoo Stopped My Hair From Shedding and Leaves It Soft and Easy To Comb and Manage</li>
    <li> used this product before seamed to work. My hair is falling out. Hoping this will stop it. Will know soon</li>
    <li> The first time I used bosley I liked it. This one was a little more in price, but I thought I&#x27;d like it even more. I was wrong. This one doesn&#x27;t work as well for me.</li>
