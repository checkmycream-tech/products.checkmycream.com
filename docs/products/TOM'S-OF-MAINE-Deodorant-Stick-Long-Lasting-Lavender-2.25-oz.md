      <li>Toms mouthwash and toothpaste is great, but not this stuff!</li>
      <li>There are lots of wonderful deodorants that do their job but also contain lots and lots of undesirable chemicals being soaked up through my arm</li>
      <li>(Please continue making excellent toothpastes, though.)</li>
      <li>and I have never had the skin reaction others have experienced.</li>
      <li>Primal Pit Paste Happy Pits cos</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>did a Google search to see if anyone else had experienced this problem and behold</li>
      <li>It is that good</li>
      <li>Smells good but...</li>
      <li>Great product, would&#x27;ve been nice if seller hadn&#x27;t blocked ingredient list with label though...</li>
      <li>Good smell.</li>
      <li>I hope to find a better product!</li>
      <li>I was trying to find an all-natural deodorant since I don&#x27;t want or need antiperspirant most of the time, but a &amp;#34;deodorant&amp;#34; this is not!</li>
      <li>Using this deodorant I haven&#x27;t had ANY problems or adverse reactions and it gives me a pleasant smell that isn&#x27;t too overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Also nice that the tube is recyclable when it is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The smell is nice</li>
      <li>and I liked the smell.</li>
      <li>really liked the smell of the Lavender on this product and the ingredients were agreeable to me.</li>
      <li>It smells nice for a bit, but wasn&#x27;t that effective as a deodorant to be honest...</li>
      <li>In the package, the stick smells nice.</li>
      <li>&amp; let me just point out that I sit in front of a computer all day at work in a nice air conditioned office</li>
      <li>This is the kind of deodorant everyone who cares about their health should use since aluminum is, in my view, an unwise thing to put on your skin.</li>
      <li>On my quest for an effective, all-natural deodorant, I chose to try this Tom&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I liked the earthy lavender scent.</li>
      <li>The scent was nice until maybe 6 hours after applying, so I&#x27;d do another couple of swipes.</li>
      <li>The lavender smell is pleasant, it somewhat reminded me of a men&#x27;s Axe deodorant but still smelt fine.</li>
      <li>nice, safe product for those who are conscientious about the aluminum in our environment.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all natural which is awesome, the product just sixkzsucks.</li>
      <li>It smells good and keeps my him sweat free...</li>
      <li>Again, I&#x27;d say go with Tom&#x27;s natural powder deodorant, which is awesome.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best aluminum-free deodorant and I love the aroma.</li>
      <li>No scary ingredients and works great.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easily washed off and smells nice.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love the smell of this product but it does cover up stench.</li>
      <li>Sure, some are better than others but most do the job &amp; the differences are just how well they do it.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this deodorant.</li>
      <li>I would be better off throwing away my money than buying this garbage.</li>
      <li>I love this lavender scent--girly but not flowery.</li>
      <li>After using it for 4 days - I will not be using it any more.</li>
      <li>I love it and intend to keep using it.</li>
      <li>Also it burns if you use it after shaving, is twice the price of dove (which i love), and i think it clogged my pores.</li>
      <li>For the most part, I felt the deodorant worked.</li>
      <li>: I use more of this than I do of deodorants that contain antiperspirant.</li>
      <li>but the product starts to become a foam lather that wipes off when you go to apply more.</li>
      <li>now I&#x27;ve switched to Lavender which works even better.  </li>
      <li>oh why is the product still available!</li>
      <li>I love this deodorant</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve always been able to put deodorant on after I shave</li>
      <li>I figured this would be ok.</li>
      <li>Whenever I use it I have to re-apply 2-3 more times throughout the day</li>
      <li>Okay I don&#x27;t know what they put in this</li>
      <li>, i will not try any more Tom&#x27;s products to find out.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I have been wanting to make the switch to using a better deodorant with better for you ingredients.</li>
      <li>after more resear ch</li>
      <li>but it could be better.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this because with so many people complaining of burning sensations, skin peeling, skin irritation, you don&#x27;t know how it will effect your skin.</li>
      <li>but it is my favorite and can no longer find the lavender scent anywhere</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>If you know what you&#x27;re buying its pretty good but don&#x27;t make my mistake.</li>
      <li>most days it worked fine,</li>
      <li>but I have been trying many paraben free and talc free products and wanted to give this a try.</li>
      <li>Went on easy</li>
      <li>I thought the deodorant smelled great and was going to be a better alternative than regular deodorants that use aluminum.</li>
      <li>too so I wanted to try something that I could easily get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>at first, i liked it because it didn&#x27;t make me smell and</li>
      <li>I actually liked it the first time I put it on.</li>
      <li>First Honeysuckle Rose and</li>
      <li>The first hour I put it on, it had a nice smell</li>
      <li>Bought this in bulk from amazon because I loved this deodorant, but when I received it, it was the new formula</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>I still haven&#x27;t found that perfect natural deoderant yet, but so far I prefer the almond &amp; aloe roll on deoderant (alvera brand?).  </li>
      <li>Well that turned out to be a huge mistake as well</li>
      <li>And my underarms are back to happy.</li>
      <li>so wish they could come up with an aluminum free antiperspirant, until then, this will do.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m too cheap to throw it away</li>
      <li>I bought this in an attempt to break free from the aluminum in my &amp;#34;Secret&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>Tom of Maine lavender deodorant is aluminum free and does not build up on my skin.</li>
      <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t expect much-- almost no deodorants have staying power on me</li>
      <li>It is one option if you are looking for an aluminum free deodorant</li>
      <li>Delivered Exactly As Advertised !!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t even live in the same zip code as the greatest thing you&#x27;ll ever use, but if you&#x27;re out of options, it can be workable.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews - people go with this product because of its lack of harmful ingredients, and many (including me) have experienced discoloration, rashes, and dead skin peel-off the size of Cleveland.  </li>
      <li>I bought this item since I love Lavender and wanted a more natural dedordant.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I wouldn&#x27;t try it even if my skin wasn&#x27;t sensitive!</li>
      <li>From what it sound like from others, the lavender is very strong and will make your armpits hell if you have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>They were bright red!</li>
      <li>My armpit skin is peeling off in chunks, bright red and burning.  </li>
      <li>It works all day if I&#x27;m not sweating too much, but if I&#x27;m doing more vigorous activity I need to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It smells fine out of the container, but I actually smell better if I use NOTHING than if I use the lavender scent!</li>
      <li>I googled this problem and noticed that many people attributed these symptoms to this particular deodorant... which is what I&#x27;ve been using.  </li>
      <li>I bought this lavender scented deodorant at walmart after deciding I wanted to switch over to an aluminum free, more natural deodorant.</li>
      <li>We ordered a batch of Tom&#x27;s deodorant from amazon and are returning it as quickly as we can.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Makes you smell worse than no deodorant after less than 30 minutes. It applies kind of wet and when I go to wash it off at night there&#x27;s a red ring of unpleasantness. So I started scrubbing the crap out of my underarms with st. Ives natural sea salt exfoliater and ditched this b.s. And my underarms are back to happy. If you want a natural deodorant use crystal essence. It&#x27;s basically a giant salt rock you wet and apply directly after you shower. You will sweat a little or lot depending but at least you won&#x27;t smell like dog farts.</li>
    <li> I have really been getting into natural/organic products and since I read up on the bad stuff in non-organic/natural deodorants I decided to try out Toms Lavender Scented deodorant. I enjoy the fresh, natural lavender smell, but it unfortunetly does not last very long at all. I would suggest reapplying. I dont like how it feels when I first apply it, but then it dries. I think that already, I have perspired less from using it. I usually sweat a lot even when im not doing any vigorous work so that was a plus. I hope that part lasts for sure!&lt;br /&gt;I will be expiramenting with other organic/natural deodorants in the future.&lt;br /&gt;I do think that I will have to get used to this type of deodorant, but im willing to if it means a healthier me!</li>
    <li> I went for this brand for my very first &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; and no aluminium deodorant and it was very disappointing. I normally put deodorant every other day and it works pretty well but the very first day I put Tom&#x27;s on my underarms I started to smell that very same night. Awful! I should have read the reviews before buying it... it doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to use this deo but was very disappointed. This was the very first natural one i have ever tried but...it made me underarms very very dry and itchy. I have never had this reaction with any other deo. :( Now im going to try kiss my face. Wish me luck</li>
    <li> Toms work wonders for me, They glide on cleanly, and does exactly what it advertized. I have not had a stinky day yet since using Toms of Maine natural deodorant. I have my husband using it now too.</li>
    <li> Okay I don&#x27;t know what they put in this but it is horrible!  I tried it a few times and immediately my arm pits began burning so viciously!  They were bright red! I had to wash it off and return it! There is some bad chemicals in this apparently!  I&#x27;m using arm and hammer natural deodorant for now, hate it need something better. Will keep searching. Toms mouthwash and toothpaste is great, but not this stuff!</li>
    <li> Made my armpits SO itchy! Seriously stinging SO badly that I almost had to go home from work. Later in the day, I noticed the skin in my armpits starting to peel off...this is crazy!  Apparently it contains an ingredient called propylene glycol which is a known skin irritant.  I highly suggest NOT buying this product.</li>
    <li> I am a 23 year old woman and nurse. I have recently tried to phase all natural products into my life. Tom&#x27;s Lavender Scented Deodorant was the very first all-natural deodorant that I tried. I have NEVER EVER had a problem with body odor. I am physically active and don&#x27;t sweat much at all. I applied Tom&#x27;s as soon as I bought it. I liked the earthy lavender scent. I was dinking around the house for the remainder of the evening. I woke up in the morning and sniffed my under arm..... oh, BOY, the fumes were OFFENSIVE. I could not believe that was coming from ME! I come across some pretty funky people as I am a nurse, but none as funky as me after using Tom&#x27;s deodorant after one application. Save your $$ DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT. This deodorant makes you smell TERRIBLE.... it is an ODORANT, not a de-odorant. YUCK YUCK YUCK. Use Jason&#x27;s brand instead. It works great! [[ASIN:B000YLAABY Jason Natural Cosmetics - Deodorant Aloe Vera Gel, 2.5 oz sticks]]</li>
    <li> I have super-sensitive skin and cannot wear regular deodorants (like Secret or Mitchum) without getting a rash and itching non-stop.  This is the only deodorant that I have found that works, smells nice and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  I like this product and it is the only deodorant I will use.  If you are having rash problems, give this a try.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work because I want to stop using secrets clinical deoderant. I tried Tom&#x27;s Lavender deoderant last night and this morning my armpits smell like I never put deoderant on. And I barely sweat. Its a darn shame.&lt;br /&gt;Application - the deoderant was sticky when you apply it and it smelled like lavender&lt;br /&gt;Why is it so hard to make an organic product that works?&lt;br /&gt;I give this 1 star for the effort to create a non toxic deoderant.</li>
    <li> This is my third day using this deoderant and I&#x27;m not happy.  It&#x27;s been mild 70 something degree weather the past few days and I&#x27;ve been indoor in the a.c. and yet my armpits smell as if I&#x27;m wearing no deoderant at all just an hour or two after application.  Again, this is with NO SWEATING.  I still haven&#x27;t found that perfect natural deoderant yet, but so far I prefer the almond &amp; aloe roll on deoderant (alvera brand?).  It&#x27;s half the cost, has a better scent and seems to work a little better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the summer, I just have to break down and use the regular chemical crap with aluminum because otherwise I stink.  I can&#x27;t wait until this deoderant is gone so I can buy a diffrent one.  I&#x27;m too cheap to throw it away unused, so I&#x27;ll just have to start carrying it in my purse so I can reapply every 1-2 hours.</li>
    <li> I saw.  I bought.  I hated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has got to be the worst deodorant on the market.  It claims to be \\&quot;long-lasting,\\&quot; however, it didn&#x27;t even make it 12 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied it right after I got out of the shower then went to work.  Within a few hours I noticed my armpits felt sticky.  I spend all day typing at a computer, so I know it wasn&#x27;t from exertion.  When I returned home, less than 10 hours after applying Tom&#x27;s, I sniffed my underarms.  Big mistake!  They reeked!  This may be \\&quot;natural\\&quot; for others, but not for me.  I&#x27;d rather not be so \\&quot;green,\\&quot; especially if it means I&#x27;m going to have body odor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the unscented regular version of this deodorant and have been pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, naturally I picked up a stick of the new long lasting lavender version expecting the same or better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just one day after using this deodorant, my armpit skin felt like it was on FIRE! The skin was red, raised and angry looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a Google search to see if anyone else had experienced this problem and behold there are hundreds of people in the same boat as me with burning and redness after using the new long lasting formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately for me, a few days of hydrocortisone cream and it went away. Other people&lt;br /&gt;have described peeling skin and long term skin discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY THIS!</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to using a natural deodorant (too many creepy ingredients in standard ones) but this just doesn&#x27;t work for me. Whenever I use it I have to re-apply 2-3 more times throughout the day and I STILL end up smelling terrible. I don&#x27;t do any kind of super labor intensive job that causes me to sweat excessively or anything like that and I don&#x27;t have this smell problem with standard deodorants. Pretty disappointing.</li>
    <li> I bought this item since I love Lavender and wanted a more natural dedordant. I actually liked it the first time I put it on. Went on easy and I liked the smell. However after a few days of use I noticed I wasn&#x27;t smelling as great as when I used Dove or other typical brands. Then I noticed that it was burned my skin a little when putting it on, very tingly. For whatever reason I used it for another day and thats when the peeling started. My pits now look like an 80 year olds (very dry and wrinkly) and has been shedding. Looks like I had a severe sunburn and every part of the skin is flaking and peeling away. Super gross. I used the product for a week and that was it for me. I wont be finishing the stick. What a waste.</li>
    <li> This is a horrible product. As you can see with the many negative reviews, this causes major skin irritation. My pits are red, peeling, and inflamed... plus, it doesn&#x27;t even work!!! Do not waste your money or your poor armpits skin!!</li>
    <li> Pros: most days it worked fine, no paste to smear with your fingers, no irritating baki ng soda, smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: my fingers kept having peeling spots and I couldn&#x27;t figure out why and suddenly one pit totally engulfed in a sunburn lile rash and peeling badly and the second trying to do the same... gonna have to stink a few days and let heal... ouch it hurts... after more resear ch I am going back to regular deodorant. ..unlikely cancer to bad issues with all the natural crap... done.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best aluminum-free deodorant and I love the aroma. This is the kind of deodorant everyone who cares about their health should use since aluminum is, in my view, an unwise thing to put on your skin.</li>
    <li> Works but its pricy.i did find a cheaper alluimm free called soft dry and it wasnonly 2.99..plus they donate to breast cancer.</li>
    <li> Bought it to try... it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> I never give bad reviews ever but I have been trying many paraben free and talc free products and wanted to give this a try. Unscented was on and I tried this floral scent and just noticed right now that the front of my arm pits are dry peeling.  My eyes practically fell out of my head with sadness. It&#x27;s going in the trash. My chemical free search is probably going to end here because of all the money I have wasted months before me wedding day. Uhhh</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Peeling, discolored, itchy underarms. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I bought this in an attempt to break free from the aluminum in my &amp;#34;Secret&amp;#34;.  I dont even sweat as I work in a bank, but at the end of the day, I could smell myself.  It just doesnt work simple as that.  I have wasted my money and will go back to what I know works, even if it isnt healthy at least I dont stink.  Even without using deodorant, I didnt smell like this.  Yuk.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this deodorant. Since I started using it I have noticed that I sweat less and can even skip a day without noticing a bad scent (confirmed by my boyfriend). I love the lavender scent and even though I have very sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve never had a problem with irritation from this deodorant.</li>
    <li> I love natural products and have used them often.  I purchased Tom&#x27;s Long Lasting Deodorant (Lavender) and tried it out.  I broke out in HORRIBLE painful boils under both arms.  I thought perhaps it was a weird, unusual reaction to shaving.  SOOO I waited for it to heal.  Did not shave.  Then after about 2 weeks, tried it again (no shaving).  Same results, awful painful boils and  extremely irritated skin.  I am NOT one who generally has sensitive skin or has allergic reactions.  Do not use this product AT ALL if you have sensitive skin.  And if you do not have sensitive skin, I advise you to test it in a small area for a few days before using it.  It has taken almost a month to heal.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at a local store. It was greasy feeling and gave me a burning rash.</li>
    <li> First of all, this deoderant is not long-lasting. I had to constantly reapply it. Second of all, it made my armpits red and incredibly itchy.</li>
    <li> Brilliant! No scary ingredients and works great.  I&#x27;ve tried the unscented and this one.  I like both, but this is a step up.  No smelly armpits and no white residue on your clothes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tom&#x27;s deodorant for years.  First Honeysuckle Rose and now I&#x27;ve switched to Lavender which works even better.  I used to be stinky and now I&#x27;m not.  I would never use aluminum on my pits.  I have tried other natural deodorants, but this one is king.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make my stinky adolescent use the unscented: [[ASIN:B0007CHJLE Tom&#x27;s of Maine - Unscented Long Lasting Stick, 2 oz sticks]].  It is like night and day.  After a day at school, I can tell whether he used it in the morning or not.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping !!  Delivered Exactly As Advertised !!</li>
    <li> I am not sure I would order this one again.  Does leave me dry under the arms but also kind of sticky</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t consider myself having sensitive skin. On my quest for an effective, all-natural deodorant, I chose to try this Tom&#x27;s. Not only does it not work whatsoever against odor (I had to reapply several times daily even when at rest), but it caused a burning rash which resulted in peeling, redness, and sensitivity for a week after I quit using it.</li>
    <li> My armpits are red, peeling, and painfully irritated.  I googled this problem and noticed that many people attributed these symptoms to this particular deodorant... which is what I&#x27;ve been using.  Thank you, Amazon, for putting these reviews in a convenient place.  As for you, Tom&#x27;s of Maine, I&#x27;m putting you on notice.  (Please continue making excellent toothpastes, though.)</li>
    <li> I have tried every deodorant I&#x27;m aware of, and I&#x27;m allergic to all of them except this one. My armpits will be extremely itchy, and feel raw and sensitive. No such reaction with this, only problem is that this Tom&#x27;s of Maine doesn&#x27;t work worth beans. Honestly, my armpits smell worse just by using this stuff than they do if I use nothing at all. I was excited because this smells like REAL lavender, not a terrible fake copy of lavender, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like lavender for more than 30 seconds after you&#x27;ve applied it. Then you just smell...bad. Like body odor, even if you aren&#x27;t sweating. This stuff is seriously terrible, and at nearly $5 at Target where I got it, I would expect it to at least do a better job than smearing dog poo on your pits. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> When I first started using this deodorant, it seemed pretty okay. The scent was nice until maybe 6 hours after applying, so I&#x27;d do another couple of swipes. No big deal! But after maybe 3 days of wearing this stuff, I noticed that my armpits were peeling... Like, extreme sunburn kind of peeling - there was a lot of skin coming off! So, I switched to another deodorant for a while, but left it somewhere and had to turn back to Tom&#x27;s. It happened the same way, where I was fine with two applications, but after a few days the peeling started. This time, instead of just peeling, my armpits also burned. They felt like they were on fire when I shaved! Needless to say, I switched to another deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say this happens with all Tom&#x27;s deodorants, I just know of it with Lavender. From what it sound like from others, the lavender is very strong and will make your armpits hell if you have sensitive skin. Honestly, I wouldn&#x27;t try it even if my skin wasn&#x27;t sensitive! Try one of their other scents, like apricot, instead.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with finding an underarm deodorant that would help me from smelling offensive to others during the work day. But the most important reason I was looking for something like Tom&#x27;s was due to wanting to avoid putting additional chemicals on my body if I didn&#x27;t need to. There are lots of wonderful deodorants that do their job but also contain lots and lots of undesirable chemicals being soaked up through my arm pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the smell of the Lavender on this product and the ingredients were agreeable to me. It was the only product on the Whole Food&#x27;s shelves that I found that I wanted to buy. And plus, you can buy this at CVS and Amazon too so I wanted to try something that I could easily get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I really tried using this product but it left my underarms smelling like cat piss within five hours. And since I had to continue working for another four hours, my shirts began to smell like cat piss by the time I got home to take them off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did the mistake of taking this with me on a hiking trip. Boy, everyone noticed how foul my smell was! Even I didn&#x27;t want to be near me. It was embarrassing that I tossed the product and just left my underarms bare and happily, I&#x27;d rather smell my own natural body funk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**&lt;br /&gt;I got home and I went back to looking for something different. After four days now, and no cat piss smell from my arm pits, I can say that I may have found my new deodorant: Stinkbug Naturals Non-GMO, Aluminum-Free Pine Cone scent. Now if only amazon.com would carry it.</li>
    <li> Horrible. So horrible. My armpit skin is peeling off in chunks, bright red and burning.  I used this product for a few days before hell started. It&#x27;s been a month since I stopped and my armpits have not improved. I read some positive reviews and I don&#x27;t get how. Their armpits must be made of steel or something. I suggest avoiding this product, not worth this risk. It may be the scent or it is just the deodorant, i will not try any more Tom&#x27;s products to find out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews - people go with this product because of its lack of harmful ingredients, and many (including me) have experienced discoloration, rashes, and dead skin peel-off the size of Cleveland.  A few things from my experience:&lt;br /&gt;1. The unscented version seems to be the least effective option for not ending up gross by 2 pm.&lt;br /&gt;2. The user needs to adjust to how it works (and doesn&#x27;t) -&lt;br /&gt;  Make sure the underarm area is completely dry before applying; dampness seems to make the burning worse.&lt;br /&gt;  Don&#x27;t slather it on heavily the way you do with other stuff; it&#x27;s going to basically fail at some point, and the more you pile on at any one time, the rougher the side effects will be.&lt;br /&gt;  Understand that it&#x27;s going to fail; I suggest keeping an extra stick at work/school for &amp;#34;freshening up&amp;#34; halfway through the day. (Again, not applying liberally)&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve been through every nasty aspect of this product, but keep coming back to it, as others have led to somehow worse.  It doesn&#x27;t even live in the same zip code as the greatest thing you&#x27;ll ever use, but if you&#x27;re out of options, it can be workable.  Hopefully these tips will help make someone else&#x27;s experience suck a little less.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed with this product. Like many other people on here have said, IT BURNS! However, I only notice the intense burning feeling right after I shave, so I&#x27;m sure that could be a factor. But I&#x27;ve always been able to put deodorant on after I shave and it&#x27;s never burned like this before. I&#x27;ve also noticed a slight discoloration of my armpits, so after about 5 days use I have stopped using it. It smells nice for a bit, but wasn&#x27;t that effective as a deodorant to be honest...especially if you&#x27;re moving a lot through the day.</li>
    <li> I bought this deodorant after reading negative things about aluminum used in most regular deodorants. This deodorant is HORRIBLE and does not work at all. After using it for 4 days - I will not be using it any more. I would be better off throwing away my money than buying this garbage. I&#x27;ve never had an issue with smelling bad, and I smell like BO when I use this. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Tom&#x27;s lavender stick has always been my go to for deodorant. I find that the unscented one barely works at all, but the extra lavender makes it a nice, clean smelling product. I read through other reviews and noted that a good deal of individuals has issues with allergic reactions or ineffectiveness. While I have sensitive skin and this product has been effective for me, the type of deodorant one buys should be measured by the product label (read and check for specific things that might irritate your skin), if you do have high epidermal sensitivity. That being said, from personal experience, if I found this product ineffective at any time, it&#x27;s because I only did a quickie application, which can blatantly be resolved by applying a little more. As for sellers, Pharmapacks is a very polite, easy Amazon seller and it was a pleasure doing business with them, in spite of it being such a simple transaction.</li>
    <li> This deoderant is not long lasting AT ALL. Mine is going into the trash tonight. A complete let down for me.</li>
    <li> I just started using this today for the first time and have only been wearing it for a couple hours. And guess what? I STINK!! I&#x27;m not even doing anything! This product is terrible and I&#x27;m going to go take a shower ASAP! Yuck!! DON&#x27;T BUY THIS DEODORANT!!</li>
    <li> I within the last few years began having problems with regular deodorant irritating me and leaving my glands swollen anytime I used it. Using this deodorant I haven&#x27;t had ANY problems or adverse reactions and it gives me a pleasant smell that isn&#x27;t too overwhelming. I love it and intend to keep using it.</li>
    <li> I bought this deodorant because I wanted one that didn&#x27;t contain aluminum. The lavender smell is pleasant, it somewhat reminded me of a men&#x27;s Axe deodorant but still smelt fine. The product does not last 24 hours as it claims, it probably lasts 4 hours without doing much physical activity. To counter the quick wear off I tried applying a lot on at once but the product starts to become a foam lather that wipes off when you go to apply more. I don&#x27;t know if this happens to all clear stick deodorants but it happened to this one. I don&#x27;t apply right after a shower so it has not ever been irritating but at the end of the day when I change clothes I notice my armpits have became very sticky. I will be using it as much as I can tolerate before throwing it out because I don&#x27;t want to go back to my old deodorant that contains aluminum. I hope to find a better product!</li>
    <li> nice, safe product for those who are conscientious about the aluminum in our environment.  Would definitely recommend this to others</li>
    <li> A little pricey but it is my favorite and can no longer find the lavender scent anywhere</li>
    <li> Bought this because the company is highly regarded and the product is aluminum free but it doesn&#x27;t work.  Within an hour of a shower I can tell it is failing.  Think they should refund my money.  Don&#x27;t bother with lavender at least or maybe all of Tom&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> The worst of the all natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried lately (and I&#x27;ve been trying really hard).&lt;br /&gt;Made my armpits PEEL completely, starting in a circle in the middle and then peeling outwards in a ring. Was so red and sore that I couldn&#x27;t wear a tshirt, just a sleeveless shirt.&lt;br /&gt;I also smelled terrible.</li>
    <li> So I just picked this up and I was excited to try it, as I recently discovered all the scary effects of using aluminum-based deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day I tried this, my skin was on FIRE for about an hour after applying. I figured it might have been the scent, or some sort of all-natural antipersperant that may have been in the product (I thought witch hazel, but it wasn&#x27;t an ingredient.) Each subsequent application was the same. I was further bummed when I saw that propylene glycol was one of the first ingredients in this product. Now, getting to the worst thing about this product. I find that only an hour or two after applying it fresh out of the shower, I smell like B.O.! I don&#x27;t even sweat at work - I&#x27;m a writer with a standing desk, but still! I don&#x27;t do any vigorous activity throughout the workday now that it&#x27;s winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am, regrettably, going back to my ph-balanced Secret deodorant, which works the best out of any deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried before, and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel like it&#x27;s being burned off!</li>
    <li> Toms has &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; their lavender deodorant-- this &amp;#34;improvement&amp;#34; smells terrible, gave me a burning red rash and was oddly frothy on my husband.  Bought this in bulk from amazon because I loved this deodorant, but when I received it, it was the new formula, now I have 5 sticks about to go to waste because I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Caused &amp;#34;skin burn&amp;#34; irritation and skin peel at application site.  NOT recommended....</li>
    <li> It goes on sticky, but dries up fast.  It works all day if I&#x27;m not sweating too much, but if I&#x27;m doing more vigorous activity I need to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 10/19/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to update the review and take a star away.  After using it for a month, I&#x27;ve started to get some irritation.  It&#x27;s not as bad as the welts some people described, but I&#x27;ve definitely gotten itchy and slightly rashy (if that&#x27;s a word).  I guess I&#x27;ll continue the hunt for something else.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after reading about aluminum in normal deodorants. I did not realize that typical modern deodorants (controlling smell) are also antiperspirants (controlling sweat). This product is a deodorant ONLY. The smell is nice but I felt sweaty and gross. It also left a sort of film on my underarms. If you know what you&#x27;re buying its pretty good but don&#x27;t make my mistake.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m basically echoing what all the negative reviews are saying here... Burning, irritation, redness &amp; making me smell SO much worse after applying had I not worn any deodorant! I actually went to the dermatologist thinking it might be something else because I thought, no it couldn&#x27;t possibly be a natural deodorant causing this many problems. I was wrong. As soon as I stopped using it, it healed &amp; never had a problem since.&lt;br /&gt;I had to chime in about how horrible this product is (and ALL their scents! They all do the exact same awful things &amp; I was really hoping it was just the lavendar. I haven&#x27;t tried the unscented but I&#x27;m so over this brand I don&#x27;t want to waste any more money or be in any more discomfort / pain!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t usually hate body products. Sure, some are better than others but most do the job &amp; the differences are just how well they do it. I can officially say I HATE this product line. When we end up with our armpits on fire &amp; for me it left dark discoloration for months I have reason to use the word hate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom&#x27;s of Maine needs to read their reviews &amp; change their formulation because this is absolutely ridiculous for such a major natural brand to have this many people saying the exact same things. And it&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re all saying it just doesn&#x27;t work or work very well - it&#x27;s causing major distress for our armpits! I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s the major natural brand of deodorant sold in most stores considering how awful a product it is &amp; how many negative reviews are out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom&#x27;s of Maine - please do us all a favor &amp; read your reviews &amp; change the formula!!!</li>
    <li> This is a really bad deodorant. I realize that it&#x27;s all natural, and that&#x27;s exactly what I wanted but as natural as it was it didn&#x27;t help with the odor protection. The first hour I put it on, it had a nice smell but then a few hours when I smelled my arm pits, it had this sour odor. Safe to say it didn&#x27;t last an hour. Plus after a week of using this deodorant my under arms started to peel and burn. I threw it out immediately. Should of read the reviews before buying this product.</li>
    <li> I am not an overly sweaty person, and I recently was reading how terrible it is to use anti-perspirant (aluminum), so I bought this Tom&#x27;s deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;1. Smells wonderful, just like Lavender Bath Salts&lt;br /&gt;2. I&#x27;ve had no issue with body odor even in the hot, southern sun&lt;br /&gt;3. My skin is sensitive, and this deodorant has caused no irritation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;1. I have to put this on a minute or so before getting dressed or else it feels a wet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I so wish they could come up with an aluminum free antiperspirant, until then, this will do.</li>
    <li> this deodorant/antiperspirant works so well for me. it smells like almost nothing--with just a hint of lavender--which i like because then it&#x27;s not so overpowering. after shaving it doesn&#x27;t hurt to put it on; it&#x27;s soothing.  also, natural, aluminum-free is always better than non-natural with aluminum. i highly recommend this to anyone looking for something that works--and works naturally.</li>
    <li> Pros: Deodorizes effectively for me, though I&#x27;ve never been a big sweater. Good smell. Not too frilly smelling - like real lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: ARMPITS OF HELL-FIRES. Peeling and red as though they are sunburned. I could tell when my boyfriend &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; my deodorant because his armpit skin started sloughing off, too. Yikes.</li>
    <li> Partner had problems with glands under the arm due to an allergic reaction/sensitivity to the Aluminum found in most brands...Tom&#x27;s is natural and doesn&#x27;t contain the harmful ingredients that are present with those other brands. It smells good and keeps my him sweat free...It is worth nothing that naturally he isn&#x27;t smelly in that region so if you need odor control you may want to look elsewhere. Give this a shot though, it&#x27;s worth it to feel and see the difference. Within around 2-3 days the swelling from the allergic reaction went away after switching to Tom&#x27;s of Maine and so now we only buy this brand for him.</li>
    <li> I received a stick of this deodorant as a free sample through a sampling company, and had such high hopes for this product! I have been wanting to make the switch to using a better deodorant with better for you ingredients. I thought the deodorant smelled great and was going to be a better alternative than regular deodorants that use aluminum. But, Tom&#x27;s of Maine still has propylene glycol, which is a petroleum derivative. Propylene glycol is a questionable ingredient that is causing concerns about such things like increased cancer risk and allergic reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few days after using this product my armpits developed a red rash and intense itching. I had to switch back to the regular deodorant I was using prior to Tom&#x27;s of Maine. My armpits also started peeling during use. I&#x27;m not sure whether it was the deodorant that was peeling off, or my skin. However, after going back to regular deodorant and alternating every other use with Tom&#x27;s of Maine Lavender deodorant, may armpits became very soft and smooth, and the itching disappeared. I did have a little bit of redness still though. For the most part, I felt the deodorant worked. A few times I had to apply it more than once a day. Whenever the product started wearing off, I never smelled as strong as I did when my regular deodorant started wearing off. So I feel that this was an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the biggest problem was developing a rash and itching from the deodorant. I also don&#x27;t like the fact that there is still a questionable ingredient being used in their product either. Because of these things, I don&#x27;t know if I want to continue using this product.</li>
    <li> USE ONLY THIS. IT IS THE BEST.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I agree with other reviewers. This deodorant doesn&#x27;t work. I have the same effect from using baking soda (even this method doesn&#x27;t save me, I guess I&#x27;m filled with toxins since I stink so much). This deodorant doesn&#x27;t make a difference if you apply it in the morning or not. Since there is no difference, there is no point to buy it.</li>
    <li> Not only does the &amp;#34;lavender&amp;#34; scent smell, the deodorant wears off fast. The first day I used it, I admit, I was more active (cleaning and such) and I noticed about 3 hours later I had to re-apply. The second day I put it on while getting ready for work, and could smell myself not even 20 minutes later, and I am not a heavy sweater or anything. So much for trying healthier things! Would not recommend</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant</li>
    <li> Arm pits are on FIRE!!! What happened? I used this stuff for years and no problem. Must be a new version and it is a killer!</li>
    <li> I smell worse we hen I use this deotorNt then when I use nothing at all</li>
    <li> This deodorant is great beside the fact that it is NOT long lasting, does not work and feels absolutely weird when put on. The scent lasts for maybe an hour as long as you DON&#x27;T sweat even the tiniest bit. It&#x27;s all natural which is awesome, the product just sixkzsucks.</li>
    <li> Great product. It did sting a bit when I first started using it but it hasn&#x27;t been a problem in a long time. I think my body got used to it. I do have to re apply in the afternoon because it doesn&#x27;t last more than 6 hours or so.</li>
    <li> I hate it when you want to like a product, but just cant. Ive been using this the past week and it only lasts about half the day, and then you smell like bo. Keep in mind i work in a call center so im really not that active. Also it burns if you use it after shaving, is twice the price of dove (which i love), and i think it clogged my pores. My pits are hard feeling and sore. My boyfriend also tried it and it made his skin red, flakey, and inflammed. Kinda ironic when the \\&quot;naturel\\&quot; deotorant gives you a bad reaction but the \\&quot;toxic\\&quot; stuff does not!</li>
    <li> I bought this lavender scented deodorant at walmart after deciding I wanted to switch over to an aluminum free, more natural deodorant. I really tried to like it. I used it for more than two weeks in an effort to let my skin adjust to using something new after years and years of using dove. I didn&#x27;t suffer from the itchiness that a lot of others had. However I did have peeling followed by red underarm skin and sensitivity. So unpleasant. Do not buy this.</li>
    <li> I had the previous formula but the &amp;#34;new-improved&amp;#34; sent smells manly to me.  I wish they hadn&#x27;t changed it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I was trying to eliminate the aluminum in my deodorant, however this product is not the answer for me. While I think of lavendar as a feminine scent, this has a masculine smell to it. The product goes on and stays sticky all day long until it rubs off on your clothes. It possibly helps with odor control some, but it is not as effective as I would like.  I tried it twice and threw it away.I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Smells good but... Just adding in, that I got a really irritated rash after using this product for a couple days. I have never been loyal to a particular brand, so have tried many antiperspirants and deodorants and this is the first one my skin had a reaction to. I went and tried \\&quot;Naturally Fresh Papaya Fusion\\&quot; roll on and its a winner. Check that brand out if you are looking for a natural.</li>
    <li> I started using Tom&#x27;s natural powder deodorant(which I&#x27;d HIGHLY recommend; lasts long, works great, probably the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used)so then I saw the lavender one and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Pretty huge mistake. Just like many other reviews for it, it BURNED my armpits, it was quite painful and intense. Every time I used it, it burned. I couldn&#x27;t use it for more than a few days when I realized the burning wasn&#x27;t because I had shaved or anything but was just caused by some ingredient in the deodorant. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this because with so many people complaining of burning sensations, skin peeling, skin irritation, you don&#x27;t know how it will effect your skin. Again, I&#x27;d say go with Tom&#x27;s natural powder deodorant, which is awesome.</li>
    <li> We ordered a batch of Tom&#x27;s deodorant from amazon and are returning it as quickly as we can. After using it for about a week, my partner&#x27;s armpits and mine are red and peeling and itchy and burning. OUCH! i read that zinc ricinoleate is likely to blame.  Neither of us have particularly sensitive skin, so I think this deodorant would affect others the same way...you&#x27;ve been warned...</li>
    <li> This is a terrific alternative to conventional products.  Works like a charm without the creepy ingredients-- even in the Texas heat!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done a lot of research regarding the danger of using certain deodorants, and it is my opinion this one is quite a bit safer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love the smell of this product but it does cover up stench.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I had a severe allergic reaction to pretty much all other deodorants that contained aluminum. at first, i liked it because it didn&#x27;t make me smell and the lavender was very subtle so it didn&#x27;t give me a fragrance allergy. then, i realized that my skin was pealing (like huge chunks of my skin, i was very alarmed) and it was causing my arm pits to burn and itch like crazyyy. also, i developed an allergic reaction to it, like i had a rash and it spread to my chest and stomach. so i went ahead and ordered Primal Pit Paste Happy Pits cos it&#x27;s made for folx w/ sensitive skin. anyway, i hope it will work out! i sweat a lot and i really want to keep my friends so i really hope it helps. so yeah, be careful! this stuff is quite intense, especially for folx with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I do use and enjoy Tom&amp;#34;s of Maine long lasting deodorant......however, I find it to be much cheaper in my local grocery store.</li>
    <li> It appears from the reviews that a lot of people are having reactions to this deodorant. I have never had any problems with it. I do wish the scents were a little more appealing, it&#x27;s not very noticeable but it&#x27;s alright. They also never seem to have any scents besides apricot and lavender in stores. It seems like the container doesn&#x27;t last very long. It is one option if you are looking for an aluminum free deodorant but it could be better. It does control odor for me.</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant from PinchMe and I&#x27;ve been using it for several days now. I honestly didn&#x27;t expect much-- almost no deodorants have staying power on me and I don&#x27;t even sweat much. I was so surprised to find that even when I sweat a little or when the day is almost done, I don&#x27;t have a strong smell of B.O. I can tell that the deodorant scent faded a little, but it&#x27;s nothing that makes me feel uncomfortable or embarrassed. I feel as though it almost completely neutralizes the scent of B.O. Also, there is no more waterproof-feeling residue left under my arms! I love it. I will definitely be trying this deodorant in other scents. :)</li>
    <li> Ok, this deodorant actually stinks!! I&#x27;m serious! It smells fine out of the container, but I actually smell better if I use NOTHING than if I use the lavender scent! Granted, I have a fairly clean/whole diet, but seriously??? Who ever heard of a deodorant that makes you smell worse?!?! To be fair, the apricot wasn&#x27;t quite as bad as the lavender... but even then, it&#x27;s still not as effective as just plain old coconut oil. I can&#x27;t speak for it&#x27;s effectiveness for someone with the average American diet, but if you like to eat/live clean, this stuff just isn&#x27;t worth it!</li>
    <li> Great smell but doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in December when I was 8 months pregnant because the aluminum in regular deodorant was causing my skin to darken. Tom of Maine lavender deodorant is aluminum free and does not build up on my skin. It&#x27;s easily washed off and smells nice. Sadly, it does not last 24 hours. After a couple of hours, I start to stink. If it&#x27;s seventy degrees out, it lasts about thirty minutes to a hour before I start to stink. If you are going to use this product carry it around with you, be prepared to reapply, and possibly wash your underarms with some facial cleansing towelettes.</li>
    <li> I bought this from the store and I used it for a week. After switching to a much more natural deodorant that doesn&#x27;t have any of the harsh chemicals this one has in it, I noticed that my armpits started peeling. It was a horrible experience. After looking it up, I found out that it happens to a lot of people who used this. Ouch. :/</li>
    <li> I was fully prepared to leave a positive review of this product, until this morning. I&#x27;ve been using the deodorant for about 2 weeks and after reading all these terrible reviews I though I was one of the lucky few for which the product worked. Unfortunately I was wrong! My arm pits are irritated, red and PEELING!!  Why oh why is the product still available! I must confess I did not purchase from Amazon, I wonder if the store I purchased it from will allow me to return used deodorant?</li>
    <li> I love this product. It smells fresh. It actually works even in the hot days of summer. I Iove the smell of lavender and I have never had the skin reaction others have experienced. I am usually very sensitive to skin products. I use only certain brands of soaps laundry detergents make up etc to avoid allergic reactions but I never had issues with this deodorant. One tip though: I use more of this than I do of deodorants that contain antiperspirant. I rub about two-three times more but once a day usually suffices. It is that good</li>
    <li> We were having trouble finding this in stores near our home.  Luckily, we found it here and received within a week.  Great response!</li>
    <li> I love this lavender scent--girly but not flowery. Nothing here reacts with my skin so I smell like I am wearing a cotton candy machine, which is the case with many commercial deodorants I have tried in various scents. Calming, but not too scented, either. My partners like it, which is always a plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stick lasts forever--I&#x27;m only on my second one in two years. Just a little swipe and away! Also nice that the tube is recyclable when it is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only time I have had this product burn is when I have accidentally given myself razor burn with a bad razor blade, or when I had a mosquito bite in my armpit (thanks, mountain camping trip!). I just use a fresh razor, shave slowly, dry off, and have never had a problem where the skin was not broken--and you really shouldn&#x27;t put much on broken skin except a bandaid anyway.</li>
    <li> I did initially read the reviews for this deodorant but I went ahead and got it anyway in hopes that it would work for me seeing as everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different. What really drew me to this product was that it didn&#x27;t contain aluminum. i&#x27;m looking for something a little more natural and since i don&#x27;t really tend to sweat much I figured this would be ok. Boy was i wrong. First things first, this is the farthest thing from long lasting as it claims. 24 hours protection? my butt. I used this in the morning and by lunch time I was a smelly mess. &amp; let me just point out that I sit in front of a computer all day at work in a nice air conditioned office and I still managed to smell like BO in a couple hours. I decided i would still give it a chance and give it a few more days. Well that turned out to be a huge mistake as well, it gave me a horrible rash and my armpits were in pain for a whole day. I would not recommend this to anyone, i&#x27;ve never gotten a rash from a deodorant or antiperspirant. Plus it&#x27;s definitely not long lasting. Completely hated it.</li>
    <li> Great product, would&#x27;ve been nice if seller hadn&#x27;t blocked ingredient list with label though...</li>
    <li> This is one of those cases where I should&#x27;ve read reviews first before buying! I&#x27;ve been on this natural kick lately and wanted to try this since I was tired of all the baby powder smelling deodorants. Well guess I&#x27;ll be going back to them because this brand is awful! Within an hour of putting this on the lavender scent was 100% gone and what was left was an awful smell that made it seem like I put on no deodorant whatsoever. I don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone and I will never buy this again!</li>
    <li> I tried this product, and it just didn&#x27;t work for me. In the package, the stick smells nice. Not so much on you. The smell of the deodorant combined with the smell of B.O. to create an even more horrible smell. I was trying to find an all-natural deodorant since I don&#x27;t want or need antiperspirant most of the time, but a &amp;#34;deodorant&amp;#34; this is not! No matter how much or little of this I applied, it just made me smell worse than if I had worn no deodorant at all. A total failure for a product labeled as a &amp;#34;deodorant&amp;#34;! If you want a natural deodorant that works, get a salt rock deodorant. Surprisingly, that&#x27;s the only natural deodorant that&#x27;s ever worked for me.</li>
    <li> It definitely doesn&#x27;t allow an extension on the lasting  of the oder protection. Don&#x27;t buy. Pretty disappointed</li>
    <li> I like this product but when it came shipped to me it had leaked all over the place. Still useable, just messy to clean up before use.</li>
