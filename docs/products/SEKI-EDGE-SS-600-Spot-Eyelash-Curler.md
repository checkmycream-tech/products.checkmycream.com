      <li>They work great.</li>
      <li>Great for curling outer lashes.</li>
      <li>Nothing amazing, but it gets the job done for those pesky corner lashes!</li>

      <li>Really good quality and easy-to-use.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>I love this!</li>
      <li>What I liked best about this curler is that I can get really close to the lash line.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve never been able to curl them using eyelash curlers.</li>
      <li>Most lash curlers do not work well for me.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s make my lashes more curlier than I have.</li>
      <li>From a very satisfied customer, thank you for creating this product and for offering it at such a great price!&lt;br</li>
      <li>When I received the Seki in the mail, I was PLEASANTLY suprised to find that it does EXACTLY what it promises, and is extremely easy to use as well.  </li>
      <li>I found it worked best after I applied my mascara and let it dry.</li>
      <li>This eyelash curler is easy to hold and I was able to get to my lashes with some practice.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll give it a two because it is cheap...</li>
      <li>I thought this would be great for the two outer lashes that never make it in the regular curler.  </li>
      <li>So glad to get them Thank you so much</li>
      <li>I am THRILLED with the results I received from my new Seki, and could not be happier with the low price I paid for such a useful, amazing product!  </li>
      <li>It does exactly what i wanted it to do.</li>
      <li>Whenever I wear mascara, I miss my outer lashes with the full-sized eyelash curler, and end up them \\&quot;sticking\\&quot; straight out, while the rest of my lashes are curled!  </li>
      <li>Thanx so much!</li>
      <li>i wanted to give this little thing a try, and i kind of regret it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So it doesn&#x27;t really curl the lashes that well.  </li>
      <li>Maybe because my eyelashes are so straight</li>
      <li>It is gentle on the lashes and really makes my lashes look longer.</li>
      <li>This little guy works wonderfully in those small areas.</li>
      <li>The unique design takes a bit of getting used to because it fits in your hand differently,  but now that I&#x27;m used to it, I wouldn&#x27;t change it.</li>
      <li>I was even able to curl the lashes at the end that always seem to crimp with other lash curlers.  </li>
      <li>More sturdy than other makes I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>As I have gotten older (55)</li>
      <li>Works most of the time but it is a little bulky</li>
      <li>THEN  I use my normal curler andit works.</li>
      <li>Because of it&#x27;s small size, the Seki conforms to those lashes at the outer edge of my eyes, and easily curls them just as a full-sized eyelash curler would!  </li>
      <li>the huge ones- tiny ones like this seki edge spot curler ensure that you get every single lash.</li>
      <li>eyelashes have always been long, BUT seem to grow very straight at the outer edges.  </li>
      <li>These work much better on my freakishly long eyelashes than the average curler.</li>
      <li>I looked everywhere for a mini eyelash curler after my old one broke.</li>
      <li>My eyelashes naturally point downwards</li>
      <li>I have so much control over the amount of curl, the location of the curl, and the definition with this curler that I will NEVER use a big curler again!</li>
      <li>Does not really curl very well.</li>
      <li>I found that it was easy to use and because it is so thin</li>
      <li>I ordered a heated eyelash curler and that seems to be doing the trick for those little buggers that want to stick straight out.  </li>

<li> I ordered a heated eyelash curler and that seems to be doing the trick for those little buggers that want to stick straight out.  </li>
<li> If you notice, the pad where it tries to curl your lashes is very sharp so whatever \\&quot;curl\\&quot; type action it tries to do ends up looking very unnatural.  </li>
<li> Sometimes you want a little extra curl in one little area, or the normal sized curler just doesn&#x27;t get to all the lashes.  </li>

<li> I have a few lashes that just won&#x27;t curl or don&#x27;t make it in to the larger eyelash curler I have.  </li>
<li> Delivery was quicker than expected, and the product is sturdy.</li>
<li> my dark eyelashes have gotten thinner and straighter.  </li>
<li> This works wonders because I can curl a little bit at a time and the sharp edge dramatically changes the direction of my lashes.</li>
<li> They are little stubborn ones</li>
<li> dont waste your time or your money.  </li>
<li> I can not stand the heavy fill of mascera</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this thing.</li>
<li> And for my little stubborn eyelashes, this thing didn&#x27;t help AT ALL!  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure why everyone loves</li>
<li> The reason I am giving it 3 stars is because the pad on the eyelash curler that the plastic piece sort of crimps your eyelash against is way to hard.  </li>
<li> But i do want my lashes to curl at least.  </li>
<li> Io use this extra times on my outer lashes both at the base and tops.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not seeing any results with this little thing :(</li>
<li> this item is useless</li>
<li> but I was unable to get the outer corners to curl with this curler.</li>
<li> Too bad it&#x27;s not!  </li>
<li> /&gt;the grip is just terrible compared to the others.</li>
<li> GRRR!!!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> What I liked best about this curler is that I can get really close to the lash line.  I found it worked best after I applied my mascara and let it dry. (If you use after you apply your mascara and it isn&#x27;t dry your lashes will glob together)  Other than that I found that it was easy to use and because it is so thin I was even able to curl the lashes at the end that always seem to crimp with other lash curlers.  Great Product.</li>
    <li> As I have gotten older (55) my dark eyelashes have gotten thinner and straighter.  I can not stand the heavy fill of mascera so i only use liner.  But i do want my lashes to curl at least.  Most lash curlers do not work well for me.  Io use this extra times on my outer lashes both at the base and tops.  Then i do the same for all my upper lashes.  THEN  I use my normal curler andit works.</li>
    <li> Nothing amazing, but it gets the job done for those pesky corner lashes!</li>
    <li> I thought this would be great for the two outer lashes that never make it in the regular curler.  Maybe because my eyelashes are so straight but I was unable to get the outer corners to curl with this curler.</li>
    <li> I have a few lashes that just won&#x27;t curl or don&#x27;t make it in to the larger eyelash curler I have.  They are little stubborn ones and I thought this tool would be perfect for them.  Too bad it&#x27;s not!  If you notice, the pad where it tries to curl your lashes is very sharp so whatever \\&quot;curl\\&quot; type action it tries to do ends up looking very unnatural.  And for my little stubborn eyelashes, this thing didn&#x27;t help AT ALL!  I ordered a heated eyelash curler and that seems to be doing the trick for those little buggers that want to stick straight out.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this thing.</li>
    <li> TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:&lt;br /&gt;My eyelashes have always been long, BUT seem to grow very straight at the outer edges.  Whenever I wear mascara, I miss my outer lashes with the full-sized eyelash curler, and end up them \\&quot;sticking\\&quot; straight out, while the rest of my lashes are curled!  GRRR!!!  Even if I pull up the corners of my eyes, and think I&#x27;m curling my outer lashes, somehow, I always managed to miss those few straight ones at the edges.  I purchased the Seki Edge Spot Eyelash Curler and refills recently, but was sceptical, because they were priced so low.  When I received the Seki in the mail, I was PLEASANTLY suprised to find that it does EXACTLY what it promises, and is extremely easy to use as well.  Because of it&#x27;s small size, the Seki conforms to those lashes at the outer edge of my eyes, and easily curls them just as a full-sized eyelash curler would!  I am THRILLED with the results I received from my new Seki, and could not be happier with the low price I paid for such a useful, amazing product!  From a very satisfied customer, thank you for creating this product and for offering it at such a great price!&lt;br /&gt;Respectfully, Madalene - Pueblo, CO.</li>
    <li> this puts an actual bend not curl in your lash.  dont waste your time or your money.  this item is useless</li>
    <li> Does not really curl very well.</li>
    <li> Thanx so much! C u again soon&amp;#62;A+++++++++++</li>
    <li> Great for curling outer lashes.</li>
    <li> Really good quality and easy-to-use.  It&#x27;s make my lashes more curlier than I have.</li>
    <li> I love this! It works like it is supposed to. It is gentle on the lashes and really makes my lashes look longer. It does take some practice to get used to it.</li>
    <li> I looked everywhere for a mini eyelash curler after my old one broke. I&#x27;m not sure why everyone loves the huge ones- tiny ones like this seki edge spot curler ensure that you get every single lash. I have so much control over the amount of curl, the location of the curl, and the definition with this curler that I will NEVER use a big curler again! Delivery was quicker than expected, and the product is sturdy. The unique design takes a bit of getting used to because it fits in your hand differently,  but now that I&#x27;m used to it, I wouldn&#x27;t change it. If you&#x27;ve never tried a mini curler before, try this one. You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is easy to hold and I was able to get to my lashes with some practice.  The reason I am giving it 3 stars is because the pad on the eyelash curler that the plastic piece sort of crimps your eyelash against is way to hard.  So it doesn&#x27;t really curl the lashes that well.  I think the pad will loosen up with use so I will keep using it to see if it improves.</li>
    <li> Sometimes you want a little extra curl in one little area, or the normal sized curler just doesn&#x27;t get to all the lashes.  This little guy works wonderfully in those small areas. I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> These work much better on my freakishly long eyelashes than the average curler.</li>
    <li> i wanted to give this little thing a try, and i kind of regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the grip is just terrible compared to the others. I end up tugging on my eyelashes. It doesn&#x27;t even curl it at all. it&#x27;s just as good as putting two sticks together up against your lashes. i gave this object a lot of tries, and now it&#x27;s sitting in a box collecting dust. I&#x27;ll give it a two because it is cheap...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not seeing any results with this little thing :(</li>
    <li> Works most of the time but it is a little bulky</li>
    <li> Very happy about the curler could not find them in town.They work great.So glad to get them Thank you so much</li>
    <li> Excellent precision eyelash curler.  More sturdy than other makes I&#x27;ve used.  Would definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t give this a review as an eyelash curler because I didn&#x27;t purchase it for that reason. I&#x27;m using it in crafting with ribbon, cords, etc. and it&#x27;s the perfect size for my needs.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes naturally point downwards and I&#x27;ve never been able to curl them using eyelash curlers. This works wonders because I can curl a little bit at a time and the sharp edge dramatically changes the direction of my lashes. It takes some practice to not poke myself in the eye, but I&#x27;m getting the hang of it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for getting lashes in the corner of my eyes. It does exactly what i wanted it to do.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! It works very good!</li>
