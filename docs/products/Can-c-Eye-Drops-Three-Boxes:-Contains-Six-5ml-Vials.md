      <li>This is for cataracts which aren&#x27;t supposed to be able to be helped naturally.</li>
      <li>Also, I don&#x27;t need my distance glasses as much since I&#x27;ve been using the drops!</li>
      <li>and I am feeling very hopeful.</li>
      <li>I used to use other drops many times per day.  </li>

      <li>haven&#x27;t run the complete 2-3 month course, I bought it for my pets cataracts</li>
      <li>.I am a &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; 84 year old, and yes, an &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; retired RN.  </li>
      <li>I hope that with time, I will see an improvement in my cataract but none so far.</li>
      <li>I have not seen any results yet, but may be too early to tell.  </li>
      <li>however is not candidate for surgery due to other problems - these drops seem to help some and they don&#x27;t build up mucous like the prescription ones did that nearly killed our little one so to be completely fair I have to say they may or may not be doing what the description touts</li>

<li> I still have a cataract in my right eye, not so bad as to be operable, which is why I am taking the drops to see if I can keep my left eye clear of cataracts and reduce the cataract in my right eye.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have cataracts only presbyopia and dry eye.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t give a positive or negative vote on this &#x3D;</li>
<li> Helps a lot with dry eyes</li>
<li> and my eyes are no longer dry and itchy.</li>
<li> Also I know longer have dry eyes which in itself is a blessing.</li>
<li> the product claims to work after a few months, but we only used them for about 2 weeks.</li>

    <li> seems to be helping which is why I have ordered more. Anyway has taken some of the pain from my eyes. This is for cataracts which aren&#x27;t supposed to be able to be helped naturally. We&#x27;ll see..........</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since December 2014.  I still have a cataract in my right eye, not so bad as to be operable, which is why I am taking the drops to see if I can keep my left eye clear of cataracts and reduce the cataract in my right eye.  I know this will take time to get results, so I am still using the drops.  Just bought my 2nd batch of 3 boxes or 6 .5 ml vials.  I hope that with time, I will see an improvement in my cataract but none so far.</li>
    <li> Helps me see more clearly in the morning.  Also, I don&#x27;t need my distance glasses as much since I&#x27;ve been using the drops!</li>
    <li> unfortunately our dear dog passed away before we could determine if the drops had any benefit. the product claims to work after a few months, but we only used them for about 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Good! Still waiting for results.</li>
    <li> Did not cure my cataract condition after a about 10 months of using it.  I will now have to see an ophthamologist for further help.</li>
    <li> Stopped using drops fpr awhile &amp; really regret it!!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first in claims that  CAN-C eye drops had healing properties. I have used CAN-C eye drops for about six weeks now. A friend gave me a bottle of CAN-C to try because in my left eye there has been a callous for years. My eye doctor said the callous could be removed but would most likely come back, I chose not to have the surgery. NOW, the callous is shrinking. Every that knows me has noticed the difference in my left eye especially my son.</li>
    <li> Love these eye drops.  I used to use other drops many times per day.  These I use once or twice a day and my eyes are no longer dry and itchy.</li>
    <li> Can-c was recommended by our insurance agent for our 12 year old miniature poodle. He has the beginning symptoms of cataracts in both eyes. Soon after we started with one drop in each eye once a day we saw reduction in the cloudiness in his eyes. After 3 months there is remarkable improvement.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s only beem a few weeks, but I can already make a small difference. I knoiw this product says it may take a few months and I am feeling very hopeful.</li>
    <li> Eric, my husband purchased these for me  (Genevieve)).  I still continue using it. When I went to the eye Dr. several months ago, I was told my macular degeneration had diminished. My heart swelled with joy !!  I continue to use this miracle product, and will continue to order as needed. .I am a &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; 84 year old, and yes, an &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; retired RN.  LOVE your CAN-C product !!  Thank you !!  Most Sincerely,  Genevieve  L Kautz</li>
    <li> Helps a lot with dry eyes</li>
    <li> Have been using these drops for several years for premature cataracts. Cataracts are still present but have not increase in size. Pricing was fair and received the drops when promised.</li>
    <li> It din&lt;br /&gt;t work on me. Made my eyesight worse!!!!! I used for two months and stopped before more damage will be made. I don&#x27;t have cataracts only presbyopia and dry eye. No good for any of this conditions.&lt;br /&gt;May benefit somebody with cataracts.</li>
    <li> a high quality product</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with Can-C.  After about two weeks of use I began noticing that colors looked brighter and most remarkedly was the improvement in my night vision, I can see the actual headlights of oncoming vehicles rather than just solid glare.  Also I know longer have dry eyes which in itself is a blessing.</li>
    <li> Good price.  Shoppe quick.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for any better!</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t run the complete 2-3 month course, I bought it for my pets cataracts</li>
    <li> I bought these eye drops at the recommendation of my vet.  My dog is 14 and was developing cataracts.  These drops seemed to make a notable difference in his eyesight and his eyes don&#x27;t look as cloudy after steady use for a few months.</li>
