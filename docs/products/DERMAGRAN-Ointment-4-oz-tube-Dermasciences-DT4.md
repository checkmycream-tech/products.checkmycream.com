    <li> Very good product.  Purchased for my elderly mother-in-law who is prone to pressure sores from sitting.  Applying the ointment after her bath has helped protect and prevent early pressure sores from progressing to deeper ulcers which we have had to deal with before.</li>
    <li> I had to dilute with another product. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had to say that before ... I have very dry skin.</li>
