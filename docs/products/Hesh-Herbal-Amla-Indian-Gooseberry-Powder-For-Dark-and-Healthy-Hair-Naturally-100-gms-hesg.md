<li> /&gt;Only a few hours after I contacted the company, they shipped me a box of Amla.</li>
<li> Not sure about this yet.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this because I read on some online forums that amla will restore loosened curls caused by using henna.  I&#x27;ve used henna twice in as many months, the first was a full henna which loosened my curls, which is why I purchased amla and mixed it with henna and Herbal Essence Hello Hydration conditioner to make a henna gloss.  My curls did not return but did not become straighter.  I purchased  Terraessentials mud wash and my springy coils returned.  I believe the mud wash clarified my hair of the henna residue.  I give this product a three because it was easy to use and it may or may not have prevented my curls from straightening.  Don&#x27;t be discouraged from using it though it may work differently for someone else.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> The product had no slip when applied.  It felt very dry but in general, my hair felt good after rinsing.</li>
    <li> This product made my hair soft and healthier feeling but it did not cover my gray. Maybe I picked the wrong selection and should have chose another color. Other than that I was satisfied</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not good. I don&#x27;t see why I get</li>
    <li> Did not see or feel a difference</li>
    <li> I am excited to use this on my hair soon for conditioning and for the health of my hair. Great item and will buy again. Awesome!!!</li>
    <li> What can I say...I suffer from hair fall out due to medication, surgery, and illness and I have tried goo goobs of treatments. All from biotin to Jason thicking products-without success. I took a chance based on all the reviews and to my delight my hair has never been healthier. Now, as many will let you know, this is not a stand alone product which means it can last up to 6mon or so. My personal recipe is as follows&lt;br /&gt;For the face&lt;br /&gt;1.2 tsp of amla powder&lt;br /&gt;2. 2tsp of bentonite clay&lt;br /&gt;3. 2 tsp of apple cider vinegar&lt;br /&gt;4. Water to your required thickness&lt;br /&gt;Apply evenly and let sit for 15 to 20 min&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For hair&lt;br /&gt;In a plastic or wood container combine the following&lt;br /&gt;1.coconut oil&lt;br /&gt;2. 2/3tbsp of amla powder&lt;br /&gt;3. 2/3 tbsp Godrej Nupur powder&lt;br /&gt;4. 2 tbsp Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;Warm Water to your required thickness, apply to hair, wrap head with plastic wram and let sit for 45 min to an hour</li>
    <li> Amla is a wonder for hair. My hair just love it!</li>
    <li> Gives the hair gloss and healthier ............ i use amla avery 2 week he make nice hair for me .</li>
    <li> I love this  powder I use it for  deep conditioner and I also added amla in my henna mixture it help with darkening my grey. I notice my hair is really strong and my growth has triple , I will use this product always in my natural hair journey.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a hair color but indeed it is only a deep treatment, it is ok I have had no unexpected hair problem.</li>
    <li> I used the product once and was allergic and had to discontinue using it.&lt;br /&gt;I also stained my nails that took weeks to remove the stains.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite hair oils. ❤️</li>
    <li> I Love this powder it work&#x27;s like it say&#x27;s on the box it&#x27;s a keeper if you want good hair use this product</li>
    <li> exceeded expectations. will recommend and will order more in the future. thanks again for the availability. sincerely, ms. c, williams</li>
    <li> prompt delivery. I apply it with shikakai and mehndi and works great. If you want to color your hair then may be have to look for another variety of mehndi</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this and didn&#x27;t feel like it did anything for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It makes a mess out of your tub on top of it.</li>
    <li> I was happy with the powder I wish this was in a easier package for pouring out. A messy product in this bag. I need to use it more to see how much I like it to.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Works well as a deep conditioner for naturals. The scent is strong but mix with a good smelling conditioner to counter the scent. The results on your hair is amazing, leaving it smooth and manageable.  Top it all off the product came fast.</li>
    <li> I made up some amla for my hair even bought the amla line from CVS pharmacy that stuff burns my scalp I made some up with coconut milk /coconut cream &amp;conditioner even before i did that put some amla oil on my hair noticed my hair was coming out where I applied the oil I mixed with oil wont be using that stuff any more .</li>
    <li> I use amla with every hair treatment and also as part of my face scrub. It leaves hair and skin clean and soft and adds a gentle (but noticable) curl to my hair and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed better growth! It won&#x27;t work miracles over night, but I would never stop using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still trying to learn how to use it right, but I like the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> Works great for my dandruff problem! I mix 2tbsp of amla powder with 2-3tbsp of olive/coconut/castor oil (any oil you use regularly on your hair works) apply to your scalp and leave for an hour or two and wash it out with a mild shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;My dandruff is almost gone.. even the anti-dandruff shampoos didn&#x27;t work so well (they just made my hair dry).</li>
    <li> I ordered this Amla powder but today I received a barely-sealed bag with a box of Brahmi powder. When I ordered the Amla they had only one box left, but I did not receive a note or a message saying that I may not get the Amla. That would have been appreciated, but now it&#x27;s just inconvenient and annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m contacting the seller and hopefully they will do something about this :(&lt;br /&gt;___________________________________UPDATE________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only a few hours after I contacted the company, they shipped me a box of Amla. I&#x27;m still awaiting it in the mail, but the quick response was great. :) No charge for their mistake, either!&lt;br /&gt;__________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;Amla arrived, it&#x27;s good quality, and was packaged well :) I&#x27;m glad this company takes responsibility and is prompt in their service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used some Amla for a face mask and it left my skin soft and glowing. By that I mean my skin looked very clear and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to use the rest in my next henna mixture for my hair.</li>
    <li> Great product! If you have dandruff or scalp issues in general, this product will definitely be great in your hair care regimen. I noticed immediate relief of itching and flaking after my first use. I mixed it with a bit of conditioner and apple cider vinegar and applied it from root to tip. Left it on for about 45 mins, washed it out and followed up with a deep conditioner. Got about four uses out of one box. Time to order more!</li>
    <li> After applying it as instructed, once you wash your hair, it washes off completely, as if you did not apply it at all.  Complete waste of time.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> i love it my hair become good .no loss</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this powder by hesh.  After using it my hair is so shiny and smooth. I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> Not sure about this yet. It seems very drying on my hair.  I bought as its supposed to be good for hair growth and mine is thinking.  But this makes my hair very dry, so difficult to rinse out and noticing more hair fall.  I will experiment with adding to my conditioner.</li>
    <li> This works well on oily hair.  You can increase its effectiveness by mixing it with another one of the hair powders from the same company, such as aritha (natural shampoo), or shikakai (conditioning), bhrami (hair growth), need (scalp problems), etc.  I just use a shaker bottle (like for smoothies) and put in half a cup of warm, pure water, mix in 1 heaping teaspoon or more of each powder, shake thoroughly, let sit 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get inside your shower/bath.  Shake again, and pour very slowly an evenly on your scalp &amp; massage it for a minute (it helps if you have a small opening on the bottle, about a dime-width max opening is ideal).  Work remainder solution through your hair length. Put a shower cap on, wash yourself &amp; do your usual bath routine (for at least 10 minutes).  Rinse your hair very lightly, put in your natural shampoo, leave on 5 minutes.  Rinse, put conditioner on your tips, leave 3 minutes, rinse thoroughly with cool water.  For really oily hair, save a tablespoon of the solution &amp; dilute it at the end with shower water (1/2 to full cup), shake it, and pour it on and leave it in your hair (don&#x27;t rinse).  Your done.  Do this at least twice a week.  Helps control really oily hair &amp; strengthens, adds body to fine hair, and shine. Enjoy!  (For best results, do the first step, get out of the shower &amp; leave it in for 30 minutes to an hour, get in, rinse, and continue with the shampoo.  Note: it doesn&#x27;t help to use regular chemical-filled shampoo or conditioner.  Find a good natural shampoo, otherwise, you undo the good you just did! I recommend the Aubrey brand. Buy it online to save money).</li>
    <li> This product destroyed my hair. It literally started breaking off in clumps and I&#x27;ve never had any problems with my hair before. I&#x27;m never trying this again. But at least it shipped on time and well.</li>
    <li> This powder has become part of my usual hair regimen now. My hair is much healthier, thicker, and shinier now since I started using the powder.</li>
    <li> I feel that my hair is the sofest it has ever been after using this product. I use it once a week since my hair is natural and easy to use. I would recommend this product to all natural sisters out there.</li>
    <li> My likes of Amla powder  was easy mixing(hot/warm water&amp;amla powder &amp;stir) also you get enough product to do 2 to 3 treatments (short/hallehair to chin length hair),the smell is of dry mixed fruit with herbal tea,was very bearable,some mixed with  their favorite conditioners or oils to tone down smell. Dislike if hair is extremely damage&amp;dry use an deep conditioner before or atfer Amla  treatment</li>
    <li> Very bad and it waste of money</li>
    <li> Packaging not impressive,will no use this product.</li>
    <li> Amla was really good on my hair. It makes it grow stronger!</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that is interested in going the all natural route.  With that said I am pleased with my hair results lately.  I&#x27;ve become an all natural ingredient consumer after researching and experiencing just how damaging the chemicals in body and hair care products can cause.  This product can be combined with Hesh Brahmi Powder, Neem Powder, Henna, Shikakai Powder for a very healthy hair care regime.</li>
    <li> I love to mix this product with my coconut milk and Bramhi.  I do this as a weekly treatment.  The product is great but I would rather get it from the local store to save on the shipping.</li>
