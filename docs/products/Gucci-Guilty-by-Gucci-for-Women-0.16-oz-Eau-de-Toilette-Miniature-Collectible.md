      <li>The woman at Sephora suggested I put lotion on first and then apply the scent on top of that, that it helps keep it stronger longer.</li>
      <li>I ordered this mini thing just to get a smell before buying the big bottle, and when it came in..it had a cheap, stinky smell, that gave me a headache right off the bat.</li>
      <li>Nice clean scent but soft and not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Very classy smell</li>
      <li>but the shipment was fast and arrived even earlier than scheduled -</li>
      <li>something so faint since I am looking for a simple neutral scent and this might fit the bill but for this price I was expecting a perfume that I could smell a bit more a few hours later.   </li>

<li> i dont use it too much since the bottle is so small..</li>
<li> and I must say I was very surprised to find that Gucci, such a prestigious brand, would have a perfume with such weak staying power.</li>
<li> but i expected it to be a spray not dabbing perfume</li>
<li> so small deff felt like a total waste of money.</li>
<li> I have a few Chanel&#x27;s and CK Euphoria Blossom and RL Glamorous</li>
<li> Ever since I got a small purse spray of Gucci Guilty, I can&#x27;t get enough of it!</li>
<li> It is very small bottle that just opens with no sprayer or anything.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this Fake Gucci..</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried both the Perfume as well as EDT and after a few hours the smell was very faint if at all.</li>
<li> I said it&#x27;s fake .Well</li>
<li> If you don&#x27;t know what 0.16oz, or miniature is, be afraid; be very afraid about getting through life without getting ripped off.</li>
<li> and when I opened it I was highly disappointed it was</li>
<li> and i usually hate perfume.</li>
<li> My husband said it has a really bad smell for a Gucci product!</li>

    <li> I have a few Chanel&#x27;s and CK Euphoria Blossom and RL Glamorous and I must say I was very surprised to find that Gucci, such a prestigious brand, would have a perfume with such weak staying power. I&#x27;ve tried both the Perfume as well as EDT and after a few hours the smell was very faint if at all. I&#x27;m still evaluating how I feel abou something so faint since I am looking for a simple neutral scent and this might fit the bill but for this price I was expecting a perfume that I could smell a bit more a few hours later.   The woman at Sephora suggested I put lotion on first and then apply the scent on top of that, that it helps keep it stronger longer. We&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> It is very small bottle that just opens with no sprayer or anything. Parfume seems to be good.</li>
    <li> i love this fragrance! it last all day and it smells great! i dont use it too much since the bottle is so small..lol.. but i can&#x27;t get enough it! i will be purchasing a bigger bottle soon!</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful and it lingers for hours. Just received my order two days ago.  Nice fragrance for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to smell like a bunch of flowers. Nice clean scent but soft and not overwhelming. You will love it!</li>
    <li> love the smell and i usually hate perfume. this is is probably my favorite</li>
    <li> the Fragrance is not at good at when I directly buy from the store....  I wonder why.. its still good  - but the shipment was fast and arrived even earlier than scheduled - My favourite is Gucci Flora !!</li>
    <li> Excellent escent soft and pleasant.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my mom and she loves it.. Its my fav now too :D  Good smell.&lt;br /&gt;love it!!</li>
    <li> Ever since I got a small purse spray of Gucci Guilty, I can&#x27;t get enough of it! I absolutely love the smell and wear it all the time.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how so many women complain about the sizes of the mini fragrances they bought.  Read the ad!  If you don&#x27;t know what 0.16oz, or miniature is, be afraid; be very afraid about getting through life without getting ripped off.</li>
    <li> Beautiful smelling pint sized perfume is awesome. The delivery was on time . I&#x27;m satisfied with the product and delivery</li>
    <li> I love it. Great for people who just want to try something. Great to carry in a purse. This is my 2nd order</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to be sooooooo smalll  I knew the fragrance before I ordered this so of course I love the smell but i expected it to be a spray not dabbing perfume</li>
    <li> I ordered this mini thing just to get a smell before buying the big bottle, and when it came in..it had a cheap, stinky smell, that gave me a headache right off the bat. My husband said it has a really bad smell for a Gucci product! I said it&#x27;s fake .Well I went ahead and bought the real thing from Sephora.com and let me tell you, the real deal smell so freakin sexy and gorgeous. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this Fake Gucci..my advice is don&#x27;t buy designer frangrances on Amazon, go to Sephora.com or fragrancenet.com  I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Can not go wrong with this perfume, very good quality and perfect to complement a classy look. The perfect price for the size.</li>
