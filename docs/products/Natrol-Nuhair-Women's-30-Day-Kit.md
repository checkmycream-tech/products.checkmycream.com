### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product!!!</li>
      <li>Very Happy with this product.  </li>
      <li>Nuhair is an excellent product, but not for &#x27;bald&#x27; people, it is for people that still have some hair and are beginning to lose it.</li>
      <li>and this is the best price!</li>
      <li>Good luck!</li>
      <li>lol  </li>
      <li>Happy with results.</li>
      <li>great product.</li>
      <li>Have been using it for 5 months with great results.</li>
      <li>Amazon delivers monthly and at a great price.</li>
      <li>and I have the most beautiful hair that a lady of my age can have, and I color it and you cannot see any damage on it.</li>
      <li>Best price I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
      <li>I was using it for about a year and saw great results; then skipped about 4 months and realized how much I missed it.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>In a month or two I hope to be able to add an additional star for this product.</li>
      <li>I must say I am extremely pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>The serum in the newer one has better ingredients.  </li>
      <li>so maybe there&#x27;s more to be had.  </li>
      <li>I have more than 18 months taking it</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t know for sure if it works for a couple of months.</li>
      <li>Easy to remember - one of each in the am and pm.</li>
      <li>The product use is easy to follow.  </li>
      <li>My physician strongly suggested that I stop taking this supplement as it could have caused my symptoms.</li>
      <li>I saw the results the first month!!</li>
      <li>However, the results are worth the wait!</li>
      <li>I REALLY wish amazon would do a better job of listing ingredients on things they sell.</li>
      <li>It takes time to see an improvement; but worth trying.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too soon to know if the kit produces even better results, so I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars for now.</li>
      <li>So far, after 6 weeks of use, I have noticed a significant decrease in the amount of hair I am shedding.  </li>
      <li>but I really can&#x27;t tell all that much.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I really recommend it....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving this a 3 now because nothing else has really worked and this might just be helping my thinning hair ...</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have purchased the complete kit.</li>
      <li>Most places fluctuate with this product, so I always do a comparison, but the package deal of the kit can be half the cost of buying just the two bottles separately.</li>
      <li>What I got was an older (but not yet expired) box.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>However, based on the manufacturers instructions, it is really too early to give up on this product.  </li>
      <li>I could see new growth on my hairline that I hadn&#x27;t seen in years.  </li>
      <li>, I began to lose a lot of hair every day and stop growing the new ones.</li>
      <li>I know I will continue using these pills and hope that new hair grows in as well.</li>
      <li>My hair falling out has reduced and with using the solution new hair growth is taking place.</li>
      <li>To see how effective it is you need to take it for at least 3 months, after this time you are going to see a lot of new hair growing and you will notice that the lose of old hair becomes almost negligible.</li>
      <li>With a wedding in my near future, it was a huge relief and a blessing to know that I will not have to wear a wig for our big day.</li>
      <li>it still fells down, but ar least it is growing.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy</li>
      <li>There is a marked decrease in the hair fall.</li>
      <li>I bought this item acording a recomendation from a freind, and it is working so far.</li>
      <li>I am 68 years old</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t do the serum as frequently as I should ...</li>
      <li>my new hair is about 4-5 inches long, and new hair is still growing</li>
      <li>The first month I noticed less hair shedding.  </li>
      <li>My hairline has&lt;br /&gt;receded and has gotten thin on top (no actual patches, just thinning).</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t honestly say that new hairs have grown in, but at the very least my hair is not shedding as it used to in the past.</li>

<li> I am taking it everyday again.</li>
<li> Taking the supplements for the past month</li>
<li> Not a worthwhile investment</li>
<li> Spent a lot of money on product and tried for a while to see if it would work with my hairloss issue only to be disappointed with results....</li>
<li> I think the website indicates that you have to use it for at least 8 months to see noticeable results.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not great with remembering to use the serum, so I reordered just the Rejuvenation and DHT Blocker tablets.</li>
<li> This is a product that can be wildly expensive elsewhere.</li>
<li> ALSO I suppressed my urge to binge eat, and when I did binge eat, I felt uncomfortable faster.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using NuHair (pills only) for a few months and noticed some improvement. This is the first time I have purchased the complete kit. It&#x27;s too soon to know if the kit produces even better results, so I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars for now. In a month or two I hope to be able to add an additional star for this product.</li>
    <li> I am on the HCG diet and noticed some increased hair loss on my 2nd and 3rd round.  I came across this product hoping it would stop my hair loss.  So far, after 6 weeks of use, I have noticed a significant decrease in the amount of hair I am shedding.  But, I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen any increased growth or thickening of my hair yet.  However, based on the manufacturers instructions, it is really too early to give up on this product.  I plan to continue using this product for the next several months</li>
    <li> This is a product that can be wildly expensive elsewhere. Best price I&#x27;ve seen so far. Most places fluctuate with this product, so I always do a comparison, but the package deal of the kit can be half the cost of buying just the two bottles separately.</li>
    <li> been using this for years and this is the best price!</li>
    <li> Ive used it before and all I can say is that tnx 2 it Im not bald, my hair is so shiny and grows faster. I highly recommend it. Good luck!</li>
    <li> The first month I noticed less hair shedding.  Month two I could see new growth on my hairline that I hadn&#x27;t seen in years.  ALSO I suppressed my urge to binge eat, and when I did binge eat, I felt uncomfortable faster.  ALSO it calmed my restless legs down by half so I quit taking my restless leg medicine.  Month 6 my new hair is about 4-5 inches long, and new hair is still growing</li>
    <li> i always buy this product and it works wonders. I am AA female and I see a big change. I would recommend</li>
    <li> My hair falling out has reduced and with using the solution new hair growth is taking place. This kit works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many of these products and ended-up disappointed but after two months, I think I am seeing some improvement. I don&#x27;t do the serum as frequently as I should ... just keep forgetting ... so maybe there&#x27;s more to be had.  I&#x27;m giving this a 3 now because nothing else has really worked and this might just be helping my thinning hair ...</li>
    <li> This is the only product that has actually started regrowth around my temples. My hairline has&lt;br /&gt;receded and has gotten thin on top (no actual patches, just thinning). I tried a couple of products that&lt;br /&gt;caused an allergic reaction. This is my third month and will continue to use it. I&#x27;m not great with remembering to use the serum, so I reordered just the Rejuvenation and DHT Blocker tablets. Easy to remember - one of each in the am and pm. I would recommend anyone to try it, however I would also recommend reading the&lt;br /&gt;ingredient list and cautions as I did.</li>
    <li> I am in the second month of using these pills. I must say I am extremely pleased with the results. There is a marked decrease in the hair fall. I can&#x27;t honestly say that new hairs have grown in, but at the very least my hair is not shedding as it used to in the past. I know I will continue using these pills and hope that new hair grows in as well.</li>
    <li> I was going bold, and I was very sad; 6 month ago I started using&lt;br /&gt;nuHair and now I have a lot of growing hair. it still fells down, but ar least it is growing.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy</li>
    <li> Great product!!! I really recommend it....I saw the results the first month!! ...my hair is growing and is fuller!! Love it</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 months continuously.  I think it is working but I really can&#x27;t tell all that much.  I think the website indicates that you have to use it for at least 8 months to see noticeable results.  I do see baby hairs growing in, so maybe that is a sign.  I gave it a 1-star since I really cannot rate it yet - was forced to give a rating within this review.   As I continue to use the product, I will provide updated reviews.    To be continued...</li>
    <li> great product. Have been using it for 5 months with great results. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It works  but if you stop using your hair starts shedding again  so 3 stars for working but think twice before starting to use</li>
    <li> using it daily, hope it works.</li>
    <li> Have not had the product long enough to see results</li>
    <li> Very Happy with this product.  I was using it for about a year and saw great results; then skipped about 4 months and realized how much I missed it. lol  It takes time to see an improvement; but worth trying.</li>
    <li> Taking the supplements for the past month and I do feel a difference in my hair texture and my hair feels fuller.  Happy with results.</li>
    <li> I have always had fine, thin hair and when I had to start taking medications for an auto-immune disease I started to lose what little hair I had. When I started taking NuHair supplements and using the hair regrowth serum, I had bald spots at my hair line, at the crown of my head and other bald spots forming daily. After using these products for four months I scheduled a salon appointment and my hairdresser was shocked an excited to see the improvement in my hair. With a wedding in my near future, it was a huge relief and a blessing to know that I will not have to wear a wig for our big day. Yes, the product takes time to work. There is no miracle solution for overnight hair regrowth. However, the results are worth the wait! Amazon delivers monthly and at a great price.</li>
    <li> Spent a lot of money on product and tried for a while to see if it would work with my hairloss issue only to be disappointed with results....any improvement I think was in my head.  Not a worthwhile investment</li>
    <li> The product use is easy to follow.  Like the package make it simply to follow the necssary steps.  I would recommend it use to anyone who is not looking for overnight results.</li>
    <li> Nuhair is an excellent product, but not for &#x27;bald&#x27; people, it is for people that still have some hair and are beginning to lose it. To see how effective it is you need to take it for at least 3 months, after this time you are going to see a lot of new hair growing and you will notice that the lose of old hair becomes almost negligible. I have more than 18 months taking it but if you stop, as I did on December 2011, in three month you are going to have the same problem that you had before, I began to lose a lot of hair every day and stop growing the new ones. It means that it is very likely that you need to take &#x27;Nuhair&#x27; for the rest of your life. I am 68 years old and I have the most beautiful hair that a lady of my age can have, and I color it and you cannot see any damage on it. I am taking it everyday again. Thank you Nuhair.</li>
    <li> works works WORKS,,,NOTHING ELSE NEEDS TO BE SAID!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002RWUPHC Natrol Nuhair Women&#x27;s 30 Day Kit]]&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Natrol Nuhair product for 7 months going on 8 months faithfully.I still have not seen any results. I can only say at least I tried the product even though I am dissapointed. Also the change of prices every month was fustrating also.</li>
    <li> I had been getting this from a online health food store but it was cheaper going through amazon.  That was a mistake.  What I got was an older (but not yet expired) box. No fault of the seller. The serum in the newer one has better ingredients.  I REALLY wish amazon would do a better job of listing ingredients on things they sell. I will still use the supplements in it. Getting it in a kit is alot cheaper than buying the supplements separately.  How the newer kit works I give 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I bought this item acording a recomendation from a freind, and it is working so far. Still waiting till finishing the cours.</li>
    <li> I felt this was a total waste of my money - didn&#x27;t see any change in my hair at all - even after buying several packages!</li>
    <li> I was taking this product for about a month when I began to experience stomach cramping and gas. My physician strongly suggested that I stop taking this supplement as it could have caused my symptoms. Just didn&#x27;t work for me, but I&#x27;ve read a number of reviews that it has worked out for others.</li>
    <li> Received the product on time and just started using it. I won&#x27;t know for sure if it works for a couple of months.</li>
</ol>
