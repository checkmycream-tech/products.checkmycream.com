      <li>it is amazing.  </li>

      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work for me, but I know many women who swear by it.  </li>
      <li>Lovely.</li>
      <li>I love the way it smells</li>
      <li>Love Potion:</li>
      <li>Got the courage to try it again when I could just let it blossom on my skin and fell in love with the scent.</li>
      <li>and it seems to need to warm up on my skin before smooth the rest of the notes together into a glorious scent.</li>
      <li>I love the self-effects one can get wearing this one.</li>
      <li>I love the buttery vanilla darkness.</li>

      <li>and I&#x27;m really glad I waited and gave it more chances because this one really is rich and lovely.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However if you like to enjoy the deeper richer resins, then you will like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is my absolute favorite scent of the Love Potion line.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s what I love about Love Potion scents:  the oils blend with my personal chemistry and smell unique!  </li>

      <li>devotees on the Love Potion forum, it really does help the scent to do both.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s full bodied and smoldering.  </li>
      <li>This is pretty strong.</li>
      <li>This is such a beautiful, mysterious and sexy scent.</li>
      <li>Lucky for me</li>
      <li>It is the dark side of sexy... mystery, intrigue and very potent.  </li>
      <li>Thank you very much for your prompt delivery and smooth buying process.</li>
      <li>Rich, deep, and incredibly sexy, Black is my favorite of the Love Potion &amp;#34;colors.&amp;#34; It manages to be delicious without being either &amp;#34;foody&amp;#34; or cloying and, like the other LPMP scents I&#x27;ve tried, it lasts and lasts.</li>
      <li>I like a nice sheer \\&quot;white\\&quot; scent</li>
      <li>&quot; sexy with a hint of innocence whereas Black is more \\&quot;clad all in silk with heels on and a glass of wine tipping towards her</li>
      <li>This is VERY UNUSUAL....</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>I knew this that first time smelling</li>
      <li>and I will say that if you can&#x27;t wait and don&#x27;t like the scent at first, give it some time to settle after the trip and shake it up well before each use.  </li>
      <li>I will definitely be buying more soon.</li>
      <li>and I thought that one was very sexy but after wearing Black, I&#x27;d have to say that Red is more the \\&quot;flannel robe with nothing underneath, roaring fire and apple cider\\</li>
      <li>Black is the perfume I reach for when I want to feel sexy!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Having tried this straight out of the mail, I wasn&#x27;t a fan at first</li>
      <li>Vanilla and resins combine to a great luscious dark mysterious blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it a bit too strong and haven&#x27;t messed around with it enough to&lt;br /&gt;see</li>
      <li>your skin chemistry plays a large part in how they smell when applied.</li>
      <li>I personally liked the scent a little</li>
      <li>It truly is nice, but a bit too dark for my skin chemistry, but this is an LPMP classic.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s resinous, absolutely.</li>
      <li>really good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you still do not like it, then at least you gave it a good try.</li>
      <li>But none of the resin notes are sharp or overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Only a touch sweet with a very organic earthy undertone.  </li>
      <li>very incense &amp; dark, but there is a note that just doesn&#x27;t work with my chemistry in this particular variant of Love Potion.</li>
      <li>This LP variant is dark sexy and seductive.</li>
      <li>If you want to feel deep, dark, and mysterious, this is a great scent to get you there.</li>
      <li>this is DEFINITELY not a scent worth almost $30.00.</li>
      <li>/&gt;LP Pink and LP Black together are pretty popular, but I traded away</li>
      <li>I have been the biggest fan of LP Red since I first tried it</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s definitely the first thing to pop into mind when thinking of the fragrance.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft and sweet, but also deep and mysterious...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s absolutely for someone who enjoys deep and mysterious scents.</li>
      <li>While wet, it&#x27;s very creamy and deep; I got dark rich vanilla and patchouli.  </li>
      <li>It is very dark, very resinous, sensuously rich and well.. black.</li>
      <li>Not for those who fear the dark side of perfume, this one is exactly what its name says it is.</li>
      <li>This is the scent you will go to when your goal is total and complete seduction.</li>
      <li>I never fail to get complements on LP Black.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, the patchouli in LP Black is just too much for me - but I LOVE to wear other LP Signature scents that also have patchouli (LP Original, Red and Pink).  </li>
      <li>I was new to artisan scents an expected the smell out of the bottle to be what it smelled like at all times.</li>
      <li>Black is one of my absolute favorites.</li>
      <li>With a title like Love Potion Black I expected total dark seduction and temptation...</li>
      <li>After it completely dried down, the scent reminded me of rich vanilla maple syrup.</li>

<li> These are custom mixed oils and from personal experience and long time</li>
<li> To be honest I hated this the first time I tried it.</li>
<li> Artisan scents work with your body and things change as they dry and are warmed by your skin.</li>
<li> and I get compliments on it every single time I wear it.</li>
<li> so the only dark thing about this was the darkness of gloom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I usually stayed far away from darker fragrances</li>
<li> You may need to work your way up to it.&lt;br /&gt;This is similar to some darker custom French perfumes I&#x27;ve smelled in the past.</li>
<li> It is dark and mysterious, and is extremely long-wearing.</li>
<li> Very dark deep resinous scent.  </li>
<li> Pink since it didn&#x27;t work well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It is absolutely NOT like that.</li>
<li> I never really cared for \\&quot;dark\\&quot; resinous scents or patchouli until I tried this perfume.</li>
<li> This is your little black dress of perfumes, but its aura is BIG!</li>
<li> not exactly the reaction I was expecting.  </li>
<li> which combo with my other LP perfumes</li>
<li> deep, a little spicy and resinous with out going overboard.</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re someone who likes your darker, patchouli-esque scents but with a base of creamy vanilla - if you want to feel sophisticated and like you&#x27;re blessed with an abundance of riches, then by all means, grab this perfume.</li>
<li> Hands down, you have to understand it.</li>
<li> LP Black is a dark and luscious vanilla combined with patchouli resins, honeycomb, brown sugar, amber resin, and a luscious Chypre blend .</li>
<li> Black is a winner it tends to be my default scent, one that I always grab for.  </li>
<li> I think one should receive \\&quot;some\\&quot; positive result instead of being told one stinks.......</li>
<li> Even the vanilla in this blend is dark!</li>
<li> and I could make out a little honeycomb.  </li>
<li> that just make it a little too resin-y for my chemistry.  </li>
<li> There&#x27;s about a few days every month where I feel a bit drained, and I feel weak, emotionally, physically</li>
<li> The patchouli seems to be the culprit for a few.</li>
<li> BUT the reaction from others was NOT loving.  </li>
<li> /&gt;It is a very small item and for its price</li>
<li> I am addicted to LP...</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
<li> It smells divine and makes me feel like a bad ass.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like the way this smells in the vial,. very incense &amp; dark, but there is a note that just doesn&#x27;t work with my chemistry in this particular variant of Love Potion. YMMV</li>
    <li> Very dark deep resinous scent.  You need to like scents like that to like this.&lt;br /&gt;However if you like to enjoy the deeper richer resins, then you will like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is so well blended it is amazing.  Vanilla and resins combine to a great luscious dark mysterious blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is also amazing blended with LOve Potion Red.  Both are must haves if you like to experiment with edible or darker type scents.  Both have been multiple repurchases for me.</li>
    <li> To be honest I hated this the first time I tried it. I applied it then felt it smelled so bad I needed to wash it off. I was new to artisan scents an expected the smell out of the bottle to be what it smelled like at all times. The way department store scents are....almost smell the same on everyone. Artisan scents work with your body and things change as they dry and are warmed by your skin.Got the courage to try it again when I could just let it blossom on my skin and fell in love with the scent. I think for me the amber is the key and it seems to need to warm up on my skin before smooth the rest of the notes together into a glorious scent. Everyone has different skin chemistry so if one scent does not work for you, try another. The patchouli seems to be the culprit for a few. I would say if you purchased this scent, let it mellow with age about a month, reapply it and leave it on for a while. If you still do not like it, then at least you gave it a good try. I personally love this one and always try to keep some on hand.</li>
    <li> If you want to feel deep, dark, and mysterious, this is a great scent to get you there. It&#x27;s resinous, absolutely. That&#x27;s definitely the first thing to pop into mind when thinking of the fragrance. But none of the resin notes are sharp or overwhelming. They blend and morph in a way that feels warm and organic. If you&#x27;re someone who likes your darker, patchouli-esque scents but with a base of creamy vanilla - if you want to feel sophisticated and like you&#x27;re blessed with an abundance of riches, then by all means, grab this perfume. It&#x27;s absolutely for someone who enjoys deep and mysterious scents. Lovely.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite scent of the Love Potion line. It is dark and mysterious, and is extremely long-wearing. This is VERY UNUSUAL....do not expect a run-of-the-mill scent that is similar to what everybody else is wearing.  It is absolutely NOT like that. Give it time to meld with your skin and your personal chemistry, and then judge it. Also, not all oils will work for all people....your skin chemistry plays a large part in how they smell when applied.</li>
    <li> What can I say... I am addicted to LP... Black is one of my absolute favorites. Not for everyone, and definitely not for work! ;)</li>
    <li> I never would have thought I would like this type of scent. I usually stayed far away from darker fragrances and I will admit it took me some time to work my way up to Black.&lt;br /&gt;This is the Haute Couture of the LP signature line. Hands down, you have to understand it. You may need to work your way up to it.&lt;br /&gt;This is similar to some darker custom French perfumes I&#x27;ve smelled in the past. I find it a welcomed relief to the over abundance of white musk fragrances littering department stores and taking over today. Don&#x27;t get me wrong I like a nice sheer \\&quot;white\\&quot; scent but IMO, it has been overdone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is sensuous. deep, a little spicy and resinous with out going overboard. I never fail to get complements on LP Black.</li>
    <li> This LP variant is dark sexy and seductive. It&#x27;s for the mysterious woman out there. It&#x27;s not a me scent per se, still though i love putting it on when i&#x27;m at home a sniff my wrist all the time. It&#x27;s a scent that will definitely get you noticed!</li>
    <li> I never really cared for \\&quot;dark\\&quot; resinous scents or patchouli until I tried this perfume. On me, vanilla and honey scents are the strongest, with the resins and herbs adding depth and complexity.</li>
    <li> Black is a winner it tends to be my default scent, one that I always grab for.  LP Black is a dark and luscious vanilla combined with patchouli resins, honeycomb, brown sugar, amber resin, and a luscious Chypre blend . It just brings out a Playfulness, in everyone around you... I love the self-effects one can get wearing this one.</li>
    <li> Lucky for me I dont let negativity affect me but this potion did not work for me....I actually was told I stank...not exactly the reaction I was expecting.  I personally liked the scent a little BUT the reaction from others was NOT loving.  With a title like Love Potion Black I expected total dark seduction and temptation...instead I was told I needed a shower badly.....so the only dark thing about this was the darkness of gloom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a very small item and for its price I think one should receive \\&quot;some\\&quot; positive result instead of being told one stinks.......this is DEFINITELY not a scent worth almost $30.00.</li>
    <li> Rich, deep, and incredibly sexy, Black is my favorite of the Love Potion &amp;#34;colors.&amp;#34; It manages to be delicious without being either &amp;#34;foody&amp;#34; or cloying and, like the other LPMP scents I&#x27;ve tried, it lasts and lasts.</li>
    <li> This is pretty strong. Just a dab&#x27;ll do ya. I like it well enough, but&lt;br /&gt;find it a bit too strong and haven&#x27;t messed around with it enough to&lt;br /&gt;see which combo with my other LP perfumes I&#x27;d like to wear it with. I know&lt;br /&gt;LP Pink and LP Black together are pretty popular, but I traded away&lt;br /&gt;my Pink since it didn&#x27;t work well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I did add some to some leftover wax (the company sells little&lt;br /&gt;wax tarts you can put in a oil/wax warmer) and my place smells really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it as either a perfume or a household oil scent, but I will&lt;br /&gt;likely be sticking with just household scent for now.</li>
    <li> This is such a beautiful, mysterious and sexy scent. I love the buttery vanilla darkness. An LP staple!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s about a few days every month where I feel a bit drained, and I feel weak, emotionally, physically ~ you name it and I feel it.  I reach for this and it&#x27;s like a surge of electricity, like this potion is charging my engine. I automatically feel so much better about myself, and my attitude changes. I love this for boosting my ego, because it makes me feel like I can do anything and will take no prisoners! It smells divine and makes me feel like a bad ass.</li>
    <li> Love Potion: Black is the perfume I reach for when I want to feel sexy! It&#x27;s soft and sweet, but also deep and mysterious...&lt;br /&gt;Love Potion Magickal Perfumerie has awesome customer service, fast shipping, and I always get free samples of other pretty scents to try!</li>
    <li> This scent doesn&#x27;t let me fade into the background, I wear it when I want to be noticed!!  NO ONE smells like me when I wear this!!  That&#x27;s what I love about Love Potion scents:  the oils blend with my personal chemistry and smell unique!  My husband loves incense-y scents, and this is one of his favorites!!</li>
    <li> Not for those who fear the dark side of perfume, this one is exactly what its name says it is. It is very dark, very resinous, sensuously rich and well.. black. Even the vanilla in this blend is dark! It truly is nice, but a bit too dark for my skin chemistry, but this is an LPMP classic. This is your little black dress of perfumes, but its aura is BIG!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me, but I know many women who swear by it.  It is the dark side of sexy... mystery, intrigue and very potent.  Unfortunately, the patchouli in LP Black is just too much for me - but I LOVE to wear other LP Signature scents that also have patchouli (LP Original, Red and Pink).  I think it&#x27;s the heavier blend of notes (Patchouli, Amber, Honeycomb) that just make it a little too resin-y for my chemistry.  In this instance, the patchouli kind of trumps the luscious vanilla that I&#x27;ve come to love in LPs.</li>
    <li> I chose a five-star rating because the product is everything I thought it would be and more. I love the way it smells and I get compliments on it every single time I wear it. Thank you very much for your prompt delivery and smooth buying process. I&#x27;m a customer for life.</li>
    <li> This one is truly divine!! While wet, it&#x27;s very creamy and deep; I got dark rich vanilla and patchouli.  After it completely dried down, the scent reminded me of rich vanilla maple syrup. Only a touch sweet with a very organic earthy undertone.  The patchouli, which can sometimes take over an entire scent with me, seemed to blend towards the background and I could make out a little honeycomb.  It&#x27;s full bodied and smoldering.  This is the scent you will go to when your goal is total and complete seduction. I have been the biggest fan of LP Red since I first tried it and I thought that one was very sexy but after wearing Black, I&#x27;d have to say that Red is more the \\&quot;flannel robe with nothing underneath, roaring fire and apple cider\\&quot; sexy with a hint of innocence whereas Black is more \\&quot;clad all in silk with heels on and a glass of wine tipping towards her lips\\&quot; - definitely taking no prisoners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having tried this straight out of the mail, I wasn&#x27;t a fan at first and I will say that if you can&#x27;t wait and don&#x27;t like the scent at first, give it some time to settle after the trip and shake it up well before each use.  These are custom mixed oils and from personal experience and long time devotees on the Love Potion forum, it really does help the scent to do both.  I knew this that first time smelling and I&#x27;m really glad I waited and gave it more chances because this one really is rich and lovely. I will definitely be buying more soon.</li>
