      <li>I&#x27;m so glad they are still made!</li>
      <li>nice</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t use yet but seems nice.</li>
      <li>This is as good as any of those that cost more.</li>
      <li>I found these replacement heads very easy to use and efficient as well.</li>

      <li>Because I work for a dentist I enjoy a variety of dental tools; so, this sounded good</li>
      <li>Great replacement heads, shipped quick and easy to swap out.</li>
      <li>I see them in most of the stores where I shop for toothbrushes</li>
      <li>I used hydrogen peroxide and turned the toothbrush to agitate for better cleaning.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>It moves slower and I prefer the origianl toothbrushes better.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>This product works well and much better than i thought.  </li>
      <li>however, i&#x27;m sure once I get used to the sensations I&#x27;ll be able to decipher if it&#x27;s better than a manual brush.</li>
      <li>I think this is a fantastic product!</li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste</li>
      <li>I SAY MORE---</li>
      <li>They are ok, but not my favorite.  </li>
      <li>Love that there is no charger cluttering up the counter, the brush is extremely comfortable, and it practically feels like I just came from the dentist!</li>
      <li>They work great and leave my mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>I used other products but this is the best.</li>
      <li>These heads seem to hold up better than the ones that originally came with the brush too.</li>
      <li>No plug near the sink to worry about and the brush cover is great for keeping the brush clean when not in use at home or when traveling.</li>
      <li>I love my Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush &amp; being able to order these replacement heads saves me time, money &amp; the hassle of trying to remember exactly which style head</li>
      <li>Consider me a huge fan.</li>
      <li>So not only am I saving money and getting a great toothbrush for my family, but I&#x27;m also saving at the dentist too.</li>
      <li>So far so good</li>
      <li>Good for young children but, not for my elderly parents.</li>
      <li>The clerk thinks they are not being made; don&#x27;t know if that is true everywhere</li>
      <li>/&gt;Reasons why I think this specific brush is a good buy:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
      <li>I love the anti-microbial properties of them as well as I&#x27;m very concerned with what&#x27;s growing on my toothbrush.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ll plagiarize myself and post the quick highlights version here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not that easy to find the heads for my particular toothbrush anymore.</li>
      <li>Simple, practical, effective.</li>
      <li>They clean really well.</li>
      <li>I feel like I am really getting my teeth clean with this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>is going to be a slightly less pleasant</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a cross action toothbrush for years now and this is one of the best prices, especially for the anti-microbial heads.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a good replacement for my brush &amp;#34;Oral-B 3d White Action Power Toothbrush&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;easy</li>
      <li>Liked the fact that you could just buy one instead of a multi-pack, which is more commonly offered.</li>
      <li>I should be able to pop off the old head and attach the new one without using a tool to do so!</li>
      <li>Love tooth brush heads along with Colgate total toothpaste!  </li>
      <li>Now it&#x27;s only better with the antimicrobial protection.  </li>
      <li>I replaced the first head after about 3 months.</li>
      <li>This is my first time using a battery powered toothbrush</li>
      <li>My daughter and I both love the Oral-B Complete Action toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Has a lot of power, extra heads don&#x27;t cost too much and you can change the batteries easily.</li>
      <li>Then I found it&#x27;s all right since I&#x27;ll get a new one with the heads.</li>
      <li>Nothing much to say, they work.</li>
      <li>very convenient.</li>
      <li>THANKS AMAZOM\N.</li>
      <li>work very well with my Oral-B toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>cannot really comment on the product itself at this time and won&#x27;t be until I find a need to use it.  </li>
      <li>It also cleans very well for me.</li>
      <li>Not to mention it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
      <li>found these cheaper on amazon with coupon etc works very well</li>
      <li>It came with the tool needed to remove the old head and, as near as I can tell works just as well as the original.</li>
      <li>Even though one can buy a new brush (with only one head) for about the same amount as the replacements, it is wasteful to put perfectly usable products into the waste stream for lack of a replacement brush.</li>
      <li>The antibiotic brushes clean my teeth better, last longer, and cost less than the ones I find at Walmart and target.</li>
      <li>Nothing to write in particular.</li>
      <li>The little tool that comes with the heads is very important.</li>
      <li>I find it highly ticklish and quite tingling afterwards.</li>
      <li>They are well made and i like them better than the more simple round brush only heads.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>As it is, this one is the lightest of the ones I tried, has a nice soft grip for small, arthritic hands.</li>
      <li>I have been using this Oral B battery operated toothbrush for at least 8 years and do not want to switch to another unless something equally effective but lighter weight comes out.</li>
      <li>It would be a shame to throw out the toothbrush just because it needed a new head.</li>
      <li>to install the new part .</li>
      <li>I found these on Amazon and the replacement couldn&#x27;t be easier and my toothbrush is like new.</li>
      <li>The batteries last a long time and are easy to replace.</li>
      <li>B00240XRUY Oral-B Complete Action Anti-Microbial Power Toothbrush 1 Count]].</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, they arrived as advertised, professionally packaged by the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;ve not needed them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can read my complete review of of this product from the toothbrush site [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>bristles are soft and don&#x27;t hurt the gums.</li>
      <li>I have a &amp;#34;Oral-B Complete Action Anti-Microbial Power Toothbrush&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ve been using that toothbrush for about a year.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s as far as any goodness went.</li>
      <li>It fits my cross action power battery Oral B toothbrush.</li>
      <li>As in, pull the head straight away from the body - this requires some leverage (Mine clicked slightly when it released).</li>
      <li>Fit my Oral-B base just fine.  </li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They are ok, but not my favorite.  I&#x27;ll use them up.  The seem a little smaller.  Good for young children but, not for my elderly parents.</li>
    <li> Great replacement heads, shipped quick and easy to swap out.</li>
    <li> Love tooth brush heads along with Colgate total toothpaste!  No more worries at the dentist office.  So thankful no more cavities!</li>
    <li> THIS IS MY 3rd ORDER---NEED I SAY MORE---THANKS AMAZOM\N.</li>
    <li> found these cheaper on amazon with coupon etc works very well</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste</li>
    <li> works perfect with my action power brush. bristles are soft and don&#x27;t hurt the gums. anti-microbial ensures a longer shelf life</li>
    <li> The antibiotic brushes clean my teeth better, last longer, and cost less than the ones I find at Walmart and target.</li>
    <li> Could not find these replacement heads in local stores.  Not even wholesale clubs that sell the brush they go with.  Amazon has them thankfully.  They are well made and i like them better than the more simple round brush only heads.  Dual action seems to work very well and these are less expensive than alternative brushes.  A good buy.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both love the Oral-B Complete Action toothbrush. I see them in most of the stores where I shop for toothbrushes but I have never seen the replacement heads. It would be a shame to throw out the toothbrush just because it needed a new head. I found these on Amazon and the replacement couldn&#x27;t be easier and my toothbrush is like new. I replaced the first head after about 3 months. I still haven&#x27;t had to replace the battery. I feel like I am really getting my teeth clean with this toothbrush. No plug near the sink to worry about and the brush cover is great for keeping the brush clean when not in use at home or when traveling.</li>
    <li> It has not become necessary to change heads yet.  This is my best toothbrush but I have others which I use too.</li>
    <li> I have a &amp;#34;Oral-B Complete Action Anti-Microbial Power Toothbrush&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ve been using that toothbrush for about a year. So I buy replacement head about every 3 months. I found these replacement heads very easy to use and efficient as well. The little tool that comes with the heads is very important. Makes a lot of difference. With that little tool, you can get the head in and out in no time. There&#x27;s one time I couldn&#x27;t find it for the second replacement and then I though I&#x27;m doomed. Then I found it&#x27;s all right since I&#x27;ll get a new one with the heads. It also cleans very well for me. Not to mention it&#x27;s very affordable. Overall, I like this product a lot and will definitely continue buying them for replacing toothbrush heads.</li>
    <li> I just got this brush and I love it. Love that there is no charger cluttering up the counter, the brush is extremely comfortable, and it practically feels like I just came from the dentist! Has a lot of power, extra heads don&#x27;t cost too much and you can change the batteries easily. I think this is a fantastic product!</li>
    <li> This was completely useless.  It did not fit together properly &amp; I am totally unable to use it. Because I work for a dentist I enjoy a variety of dental tools; so, this sounded good but that&#x27;s as far as any goodness went. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> I have been using this Oral B battery operated toothbrush for at least 8 years and do not want to switch to another unless something equally effective but lighter weight comes out. As it is, this one is the lightest of the ones I tried, has a nice soft grip for small, arthritic hands. The batteries last a long time and are easy to replace. Now I find that my local drugstore no longer carries the replacement brushes. The clerk thinks they are not being made; don&#x27;t know if that is true everywhere but I am very happy to find the replacement brushes on Amazon. Even though one can buy a new brush (with only one head) for about the same amount as the replacements, it is wasteful to put perfectly usable products into the waste stream for lack of a replacement brush.</li>
    <li> I love my Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush &amp; being able to order these replacement heads saves me time, money &amp; the hassle of trying to remember exactly which style head I need when I&#x27;m at a store. These heads seem to hold up better than the ones that originally came with the brush too. I love the anti-microbial properties of them as well as I&#x27;m very concerned with what&#x27;s growing on my toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Very good tooth brush and refills. They clean really well.</li>
    <li> No problems at all.  It came with the tool needed to remove the old head and, as near as I can tell works just as well as the original.</li>
    <li> On time delivery. as described</li>
    <li> I get these all the time. 5 stars. Cheaper than at the local stores.</li>
    <li> work very well with my Oral-B toothbrush.  Long lasting and I like it.</li>
    <li> A great toothbrush replacement. I&#x27;m so glad they are still made!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a battery powered toothbrush so it definitely takes some getting used to. I find it highly ticklish and quite tingling afterwards. So far so good however, i&#x27;m sure once I get used to the sensations I&#x27;ll be able to decipher if it&#x27;s better than a manual brush.</li>
    <li> I should be able to pop off the old head and attach the new one without using a tool to do so!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t use yet but seems nice.</li>
    <li> It moves slower and I prefer the origianl toothbrushes better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush (the non-antimicrobial version) for about five years now, replacing the heads and batteries as needed, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Now it&#x27;s only better with the antimicrobial protection.  With these you get the vigorous round action combined with the criss-cross brushes and the results are great. Why buy far more expensive sets when this brush does it all - and for much less cost?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m reviewing this now (after so long) is my three children, all of whom have been using these brushes nearly as long as I, just got back from a cleaning/check-up with no cavities...again. So not only am I saving money and getting a great toothbrush for my family, but I&#x27;m also saving at the dentist too. Consider me a huge fan. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This product works well and much better than i thought.  Goes with the $3 electric brush perfectly and it feels good.</li>
    <li> Nice replacement for a good price. Have used similar items for other types of brushes. This is as good as any of those that cost more.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a good replacement for my brush &amp;#34;Oral-B 3d White Action Power Toothbrush&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;easy to install the new part .</li>
    <li> Finally a toothbrush head that helps fights germs! I have wondered for years why they haven&#x27;t come up with this sooner!!</li>
    <li> Nothing to write in particular. As expected. It&#x27;s a toothbrush head after all.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that easy to find the heads for my particular toothbrush anymore. I think Oral-B and other companies do this intentionally, so you&#x27;re forced to upgrade your toothbrush every few years. Oh well, if I can keep getting these on Amazon, I will.</li>
    <li> The package comes with 2 replacement heads and 1 replacement tool. The tool is used to press down on the small recessed \\&quot;button\\&quot; on the front. This releases the head for removal in an upward motion. As in, pull the head straight away from the body - this requires some leverage (Mine clicked slightly when it released). Misplacing the tool isn&#x27;t the end of the world though. You will need something small, long and hard enough to press the \\&quot;button\\&quot;. But it does require quite a bit of leverage, so try to hang on to the tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can read my complete review of of this product from the toothbrush site [[ASIN:B00240XRUY Oral-B Complete Action Anti-Microbial Power Toothbrush 1 Count]]. But I&#x27;ll plagiarize myself and post the quick highlights version here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasons why I think this specific brush is a good buy:&lt;br /&gt;1. Reasonably priced. Worst case scenario, it&#x27;s a loss of only a few dollars.&lt;br /&gt;2. Battery is replaceable and seems to last a while. I haven&#x27;t changed mine in 5 months, but can tell it is slightly less powerful.&lt;br /&gt;3. Portable, since it is battery operated. Also, no need to wait for the brush to charge.&lt;br /&gt;4. Replacement heads are available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that this brush should be regularly cleaned/sterilized. I used hydrogen peroxide and turned the toothbrush to agitate for better cleaning. Also, it is best to remove the head for cleaning - otherwise replacing the brush head is going to be a slightly less pleasant experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, great brush. Simple, practical, effective. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> good toothbrush.  nice it has this replacement head.  very convenient.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It fits my cross action power battery Oral B toothbrush.</li>
    <li> The item arrived and performed as expected.</li>
    <li> Just what I thought it would be.  Fit my Oral-B base just fine.  Liked the fact that you could just buy one instead of a multi-pack, which is more commonly offered.</li>
    <li> I can not find these.  As A long term user my units were getting shabby.  Every time the brushes wear out it takes forever for me to find them</li>
    <li> Nothing much to say, they work.</li>
    <li> These are as good for the teeth as they always were.  I don&#x27;t know why I stopped buying them. Good price, too.</li>
    <li> I have used these toothbrush head replacements before and I find them difficult to source now in the stores so I am quite happy to be able to get them at a good price.</li>
    <li> Very good product. I wish it is little cheaper. I used other products but this is the best. I will buy again if I need it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a cross action toothbrush for years now and this is one of the best prices, especially for the anti-microbial heads. They work great and leave my mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> I ordered this at the same time I bought my toothbrush so I&#x27;d have them when I needed them.  So far, I&#x27;ve not needed them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, they arrived as advertised, professionally packaged by the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot really comment on the product itself at this time and won&#x27;t be until I find a need to use it.  Only that it came promptly and as advertised and packaged well.</li>
