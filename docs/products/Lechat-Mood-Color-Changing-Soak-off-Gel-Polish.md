### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The mood polish transition in colors is awesome!!!!!</li>
      <li>It came on v time and works great.</li>
      <li>NOT an attractive look).  </li>
      <li>--it&#x27;s rather fascinating.</li>
      <li>💜 this color was very entertaining.</li>
      <li>Fun Polish to have works great!</li>
      <li>We love it!</li>
      <li>ABSOLUTELY love this color!  </li>
      <li>I love this because you can act like a kid with mood changing polish!</li>
      <li>Will buy more soon!</li>
      <li>Matte color goes from very light lilac to bright plum.</li>
      <li>It changes throughout the day and you catch yourself staring at your own nails often.</li>
      <li>This polish has a good texture and consistency and is easy to apply; 2 coats should provide opacity for you.</li>
      <li>Normally, i&#x27;m very pleased with the results of my at home gel manicures (I primarily use Gelish brand polishes) and friends</li>
      <li>Love this brand of color change gel polish</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, but i would have preferred the one with the glitter in it.</li>
      <li>to shop and purchase more.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping , GREAT DEALS , did my nails</li>
      <li>Love this but peels off after a day.</li>
      <li>I love this polish.</li>
      <li>Looked good but very sticky and didn&#x27;t go on too well!</li>
      <li>It was more of a temperature change color but still very pretty!</li>
      <li>The other two I have in glitter and frost colors were awesome!</li>
      <li>The lavender color is a lot darker than pictured but still very pretty color.</li>
      <li>And it changes really well too!!  </li>
      <li>Maybe because I dont have a strong enough uv light like it calls for?  </li>
      <li>The only con I have is that the color shows lavender when your hands are warm, but it is more white.</li>
      <li>get more of a lilac hue in reality than a blue lavender like the photo.</li>
      <li>This one didn&#x27;t last longer than a day before I took it off, and I&#x27;ll be passing the bottle on to a friend to see if she has better results than I did.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Pretty color.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been doing my own soak off gel polish for about 4 years, and this is one of if not THE most frustrating polishes that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>I really like the transition from color to color</li>
      <li>Really exceeded my expectations.</li>
      <li>THANKS Ann</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other brands of color change gel polishes, and had much better results.  </li>
      <li>It was peeled right off, and this was not expected.</li>
      <li>Its white when warm and pink</li>
      <li>My nails are just long enough for the tips to stay cooler, giving an interesting &amp;#34;french manicure look&amp;#34;... I am in love and had bought 2 other colors from Le chat.</li>
      <li>Very temperature sensitive.  </li>
      <li>So, I put on a glitter gel polish to have a little extra color when my hands were warm.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t tell that my manicure was not done by a professional.  </li>
      <li>color wasn&#x27;t exactly what it was represented as, and when I put on multiple coats (which was necessary for coverage)</li>
      <li>But other than that the color was pretty.</li>
      <li>In addition the Polish came off quickly within a week and no special removal was necessary!</li>

<li> This gel polish is a bit darker purple than shown online in LeChat&#x27;s and Amazon&#x27;s advertisements, but it&#x27;s impossible to rely on computer screen representations of colour as shown.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I did not like this product&#x27;s color changing</li>
    <li> color wasn&#x27;t exactly what it was represented as, and when I put on multiple coats (which was necessary for coverage) it was not like my other gel polishes-- not a smooth application at all, it looked almost gummy coming from the bottle, and the color change ended up not being even (i had splotches of uneven color changing, almost like globs of thin/thick areas of polish on my nail... NOT an attractive look).  I tried buffing down some of the polish clumps and re-applying a final coat which helped some, but the polish isn&#x27;t the same consistency as the gel brands that I&#x27;m used to working with so overall, i wasn&#x27;t pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been doing my own soak off gel polish for about 4 years, and this is one of if not THE most frustrating polishes that I&#x27;ve used.  Normally, i&#x27;m very pleased with the results of my at home gel manicures (I primarily use Gelish brand polishes) and friends can&#x27;t tell that my manicure was not done by a professional.  This one didn&#x27;t last longer than a day before I took it off, and I&#x27;ll be passing the bottle on to a friend to see if she has better results than I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other brands of color change gel polishes, and had much better results.  It wasn&#x27;t HORRIBLE, but also was not anything like I expected.</li>
    <li> Fun Polish to have works great!</li>
    <li> The polish lasts a long time and changes colors with cold and hot hand temperatures. The mood color changed all the way up till my next polish change. The only con I have is that the color shows lavender when your hands are warm, but it is more white. So, I put on a glitter gel polish to have a little extra color when my hands were warm.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY love this color!  And it changes really well too!!  Although it should be called Temperature Changing.&lt;br /&gt;https://instagram.com/p/4dXQ02B6x3/?taken-by&#x3D;luckyrox</li>
    <li> I love this because you can act like a kid with mood changing polish! This only comes with the gel polish. There isn&#x27;t a touch up polish. I wish it came with both but it still makes an impact being a mood changing gel polish.</li>
    <li> Love this but peels off after a day. Maybe because I dont have a strong enough uv light like it calls for?  The mood polish transition in colors is awesome!!!!!</li>
    <li> This gel polish is a bit darker purple than shown online in LeChat&#x27;s and Amazon&#x27;s advertisements, but it&#x27;s impossible to rely on computer screen representations of colour as shown. The change with heat and cold is really dramatic and occurs with ordinary body temperatures, or you may find yourself playing in the sink with warm and cold water with your new manicure--it&#x27;s rather fascinating. This polish has a good texture and consistency and is easy to apply; 2 coats should provide opacity for you.</li>
    <li> Matte color goes from very light lilac to bright plum. Very temperature sensitive.  Goes every color in between. Pretty color.</li>
    <li> I really like the transition from color to color but when I received the package, the bottle was opened and some of the nailpolish had leaked out. But other than that the color was pretty.</li>
    <li> The lavender color is a lot darker than pictured but still very pretty color.I am a licensed nail technician and I use this line of gel polishes on my clients and myself.The gel polish wears well.We love it!</li>
    <li> I love this polish. It came on v time and works great.</li>
    <li> So i was expecting this to be the one with the sparkles in it.  Its white when warm and pink when cold.  It&#x27;s okay, but i would have preferred the one with the glitter in it.</li>
    <li> Literally named &#x27;Lavender Bloom&#x27; goes from a medium grape purple to an almost white lilac and everything in between.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a thick formula. The application brush is soft and long, so it&#x27;s hard to get a thin coat on, but LED curing was easy. Really exceeded my expectations. Photo is posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get more of a lilac hue in reality than a blue lavender like the photo. Manufacturer says that&#x27;s expected and varies. The entire line is quite a bit darker and brighter than I had expected from the marketing display photos.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping , GREAT DEALS , did my nails they look great.hope to shop and purchase more. THANKS Ann</li>
    <li> Looked good but very sticky and didn&#x27;t go on too well!</li>
    <li> Wow! This &amp;#34;mood&amp;#34; polish goes from lavendar when cold to white when hot... plus in between colors!

    <li> 💜 this color was very entertaining. It was more of a temperature change color but still very pretty! A+ color!</li>
