      <li>but I can tell after 2 to 3 months my hair will be just fine</li>
      <li>IT DID NOT THICKEN my hair but generated regrowth of fine hairs in the areas of usage.</li>
      <li>but I still keep this one in my stays because it&#x27;s so light.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m one happy sista whose sides are once again growing back.</li>
      <li>My husband originally used this product as a pomade</li>
      <li>Had to clean this product off as well,&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>Just as expected and works great</li>
      <li>I like to use the optimum hair dress line, and I wanted to try something different.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve used this for about 1 month now and its crazy how my hair is getting more and more thicker and longer very impressed</li>
      <li>my english is not so good</li>
      <li>this product help my natural hair to detangle very easy and to keep it in his place, this product also remember me the blue magic my mom use to show on my hair when i was a chid!</li>
      <li>This product is great for repairing damaged or missing baby hairs around the edges of hairline.</li>
      <li>It has a nice smell..not at all sticky...and it gives nice texture and strength to the hairs..and makes them thick and shiny.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>yesterday I started to use it right away</li>
      <li>I only have like 3 inches of perm left, and Im about to chop that off :P</li>
      <li>First, the price is a rip off.  </li>
      <li>However the first ingredient is mineral oil which clogs up pores.</li>
      <li>After two months my edges filled up completely.</li>
      <li>I have been using the hair vitalizer over the last few weeks and it is very good.</li>
      <li>It works really well, however when I tried it the first time I put it in after a morning shower and when I got to work my hair looked so greasy, like I hadn&#x27;t showered in a month.</li>
      <li>Today is my first day of using the product and i really like it.  </li>
      <li>This really does work.</li>
      <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
      <li>I knew it made my husband&#x27;s hair thicker but never knew just how much it&#x27;d work til I tried it myself.</li>
      <li>They do not cause hair growth especially in natural hair</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very inexpensive and I believe this stuff is better than rogaine or any of that other hair volumizing products.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure that this saved my edges, but I used it in combination Jamaican black castor oil w/ coconut oil.</li>
      <li>I use it twice a week and my new growth is amazing thick, and it&#x27;s coming in fast.</li>
      <li>winter normally dries my hair out</li>
      <li>I am an African American woman, who has fine oily hair.</li>
      <li>I also noticed it leaves your hair very soft, manageable, and shiny.</li>
      <li>There was much more shedding than usual.</li>
      <li>My hair is now 80% natural now!</li>
      <li>Secondly, because I was looking for a hairdress without many harsh chemicals and one that was ideal for 4b type hair, I was disappointed to see that petroleum is one the first listed on the ingredients list.  </li>
      <li>Definitely recommending this to all my friends and anyone who wants thicker fuller hair almost overnight.</li>
      <li>Seems to be working so far</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s thick healthy luster.</li>
      <li>But I noticed his hair looks thick and more dense then</li>
      <li>Everything about this product I love seriously from the smell to how it helps thicken and regrowth my hair now I&#x27;m a guy and my race is black,hispanic,and white....</li>
      <li>Usually I wear braids or a ponytail, I decided to get a special hairstyle for my Birthday.     </li>
      <li>I decide to go natural last july</li>
      <li>For African American women looking to transition to natural hair or who already have natural hair, I would not recommend this product.</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way, I do 3-4 large parts, and LIGHTLY grease my scalp, and it does not weigh my hair down.</li>
      <li>You will not notice a difference right away, but in a few months hair will begin to show where you placed the grease.</li>
      <li>Doo gro usually gets stellar reviews from nearly everyone, but the product is so greasy and it clogs your scalp!</li>
      <li>Next morning I noticed that my thinning area was barely noticeable.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use too much or your hair might get weighed down.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m natural and my hair tends to dry out when i use water based products alone,</li>
      <li>I have very damaged hair at the top and its thinning bad</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is one of the best production I am useing as Soon as I got it in the mail yesterday I started to use it right away and it smell really really good</li>
    <li> very good product help my hair to not tangle, sorry im from latin america my english is not so good but yess this product help my natural hair to detangle very easy and to keep it in his place, this product also remember me the blue magic my mom use to show on my hair when i was a chid!</li>
    <li> We have been using this product for years. I use to help keep my hair somewhat manageable when I put it into a pony tail.</li>
    <li> Hair grease is not always great but I still keep this one in my stays because it&#x27;s so light.  Usually I use it in conjunction with my edge tamer.</li>
    <li> This product is great for repairing damaged or missing baby hairs around the edges of hairline.I&#x27;m on my second jar and it does work. It does have a slight med smell so I recommend using it at bedtime. You will not notice a difference right away, but in a few months hair will begin to show where you placed the grease. Note: IT DID NOT THICKEN my hair but generated regrowth of fine hairs in the areas of usage. For this reason, I gave only 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the directions and happy growing.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair, and had been growing out my relaxer for 9 months. Usually I wear braids or a ponytail, I decided to get a special hairstyle for my Birthday.     I nearly fell out 2 weeks ago, when I removed a sew-in weave only to discover my sides were very thin, and missing. There was much more shedding than usual. One side of my temples was worse than the other, and looked bald with very minimal hair surrounding the thinned out area.    I was literally tearful for about 2 days, and just saddened by my hair loss. My hair has been long all my life until now.    Doo Gro was there to help me. There&#x27;s a Money Back Gurantee if the product doesn&#x27;t work. It smells really good, and 4 oz. goes a long ways so it&#x27;s worth the price. It gives the hair a shiny lustre, use it sparingly so you don&#x27;t overgrease your hair. It helps to combat dryness of hair, and made my hair feel softer and manageable. It also helped me with my tangles, my hair was a mess after that weave.    I dried my tears and got myself together to face my problem. I got my ends cut, and had my daughter massage my hair entirely with Doo Gro. I massaged my temples especially, took some vitamins only for 2 days. So I would say the combo of massaging, and Doo Gro I did see improvement. My hair looks fuller in that section considering the trauma. I actually have a thin cover up layer in the thin section without pulling hair from other areas.      No more tight weaves for me, but I plan on trying other Doo Gro products and I will continue using this product. No complaints from me. I&#x27;m one happy sista whose sides are once again growing back. Be patient, find a healthy hair regimen and you&#x27;ll see results. I plan on restarting my vitamins, and I should have double growing power!    This product worked for me, that&#x27;s why I gave it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Doo Grow Thickening Hairdress received 2 stars for several reasons.  First, the price is a rip off.  I saw this same product at the local dollar store for $4 less than what it is selling for here.  Secondly, because I was looking for a hairdress without many harsh chemicals and one that was ideal for 4b type hair, I was disappointed to see that petroleum is one the first listed on the ingredients list.  As research shows, petroleum is not good for most individuals with 4b type hair because petroleum blocks pores of the scalp resulting in slow hair growth.  Third, the product is thick and makes my hair greasy even if I use a small amount.  For every negative characteristic, I deducted one star.  The main good quality about this product is that it has a nice smell.  For African American women looking to transition to natural hair or who already have natural hair, I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product 2 months ago. So far, my hair is stronger, seems to have grown longer and breaks less. I love it.  I will follow up in 6 months but so far so good!</li>
    <li> ok, don&#x27;t expect any results</li>
    <li> I have been using the hair vitalizer over the last few weeks and it is very good. It has a nice smell..not at all sticky...and it gives nice texture and strength to the hairs..and makes them thick and shiny. You will start seeing the results after using it for a week. Thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> good product, I recommend.</li>
    <li> Amazing. Item came quick and fast, perfectly as described. I love this item, just like the store bought one.</li>
    <li> Everything about this product I love seriously from the smell to how it helps thicken and regrowth my hair now I&#x27;m a guy and my race is black,hispanic,and white.... I have very damaged hair at the top and its thinning bad but I&#x27;ve used this for about 1 month now and its crazy how my hair is getting more and more thicker and longer very impressed , honestly I wish it can speed up the results and hurry but I can tell after 2 to 3 months my hair will be just fine and how I want it so I would recommend this product not bad at all! :-)</li>
    <li> I actually came across this product in a CVS store and bought it. I have short-cut, relaxed hair. Fall/winter normally dries my hair out so I wanted something to give me some sheen. A little goes a long way w/ this product. Don&#x27;t use too much or your hair might get weighed down. The smell is AWESOME!!!!!!!! I absolutely love it. If I&#x27;m between washes/dry shampoo I&#x27;ll massage this into my scalp to give my hair a nice smell. I also work out everyday or every other day so I also use this to cut the smell of sweat(if I dnt get to wash my hair immediately). I gave it 4 stars because I just started using it and I&#x27;m not sure how well it&#x27;s working yet w/ d anti-thinning so we&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> How to remove this heavy grease from hair...plz help me.. I washed my hair more than 8 or 9 times but couldn&#x27;t be able to remove the grease. Plz let me know as soon as possible. This doo gro is really very bad product.</li>
    <li> Smell great. However the first ingredient is mineral oil which clogs up pores. The company wanted me to mail back the unused portion in order to get a refund, although i have proof of purchase.</li>
    <li> It works really well, however when I tried it the first time I put it in after a morning shower and when I got to work my hair looked so greasy, like I hadn&#x27;t showered in a month. I was mortified. I went home and washed it out, so needless to say I started to put it in at night before I went to bed and wash it out the following morning.</li>
    <li> These African-American hair products are so bad, I would not accept them for free. They do not cause hair growth especially in natural hair rather they clog your pores and cause hair loss.</li>
    <li> I am an African American woman, who has fine oily hair. After a traumatic experience with a sew in which abolished my edges as well as thinned out my hair. I can&#x27;t say for sure that this saved my edges, but I used it in combination Jamaican black castor oil w/ coconut oil. After two months my edges filled up completely. It didn&#x27;t make my hair thicker but it restored the was lost (bald areas) due to the sew in. I use the hair grease once a week, and my hair continues to grow. A little goes a long way, I do 3-4 large parts, and LIGHTLY grease my scalp, and it does not weigh my hair down.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair thick and manageable!</li>
    <li> Doo gro usually gets stellar reviews from nearly everyone, but the product is so greasy and it clogs your scalp! It doesn&#x27;t penetrate it; it sits on top of your scalp. I used it after a wash, and instead of having moisturized hair when it dried, I had dry and crispy tresses. I like to use the optimum hair dress line, and I wanted to try something different.</li>
    <li> This really does work. I used it on my edges and less then a week I can see a difference.</li>
    <li> Greasy, but has a nice smell. Seems to be working so far</li>
    <li> smelsl pleasant and works well</li>
    <li> Had to clean this product off as well,&lt;br /&gt;But I was satisfied.</li>
    <li> ....how wonderful this vitalizer is. I use it twice a week and my new growth is amazing thick, and it&#x27;s coming in fast. I decide to go natural last july and I started to use this then. My hair is now 80% natural now! I only have like 3 inches of perm left, and Im about to chop that off :P</li>
    <li> I love it! I don&#x27;t know what would do without it! Thank you!</li>
    <li> My husband originally used this product as a pomade sorta think to slick his hair up. But I noticed his hair looks thick and more dense then outta boredom I read the jar that it thickens your hair. His hair always smelled good too. One night we were going to go out and as I was combing my hair I noticed I&#x27;m getting a little thin around the front of my head. My husband said to try the Doo Gro. He rubbed the Doo gro into my hair and then applied a little bit of water to it. I combed my hair as I usually would. Next morning I noticed that my thinning area was barely noticeable. I was amazed ! I knew it made my husband&#x27;s hair thicker but never knew just how much it&#x27;d work til I tried it myself. It&#x27;s very inexpensive and I believe this stuff is better than rogaine or any of that other hair volumizing products. If you got thinning hair and wish you had thick full hair get yourself this Doo Gro Mega Thick and you can save that thinning hair back to it&#x27;s thick healthy luster. I also noticed it leaves your hair very soft, manageable, and shiny. I&#x27;m gonna have to share a jar with my Mom for her thinning hair. Definitely recommending this to all my friends and anyone who wants thicker fuller hair almost overnight.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few months around my edges and I see no growth at all.</li>
    <li> Just as expected and works great</li>
    <li> I really love this product, I mix it with Wheat germ oil and use it to grease my scalp.  I&#x27;m natural and my hair tends to dry out when i use water based products alone, so using doo gro with this helps my hair to retain moisture longer.</li>
    <li> Today is my first day of using the product and i really like it.  One thing i like about this product is.. it smells good, it makes my hair shine, smooth, and i dont have to wash after using it.  Hopefully over time it will make my hair thicker.</li>
    <li> This was for my wife; she love it. She and her friends found it good for their hair health so she is buying it again.</li>
    <li> Used this preduct for years.  Actually grows your hair.</li>
