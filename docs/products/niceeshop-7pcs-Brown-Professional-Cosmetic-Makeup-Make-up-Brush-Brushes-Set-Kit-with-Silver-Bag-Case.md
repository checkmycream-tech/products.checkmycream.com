<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Everything is as pictured. Arrived very early. The bag is perfect too.</li>
    <li> Not something I would buy again though the variety of brushes were ideal the quality was not.</li>
    <li> i actually bought this set for my older sister for her birthday. I know she needed a set of make up brushes. And every time i see her doing her make up, she uses those brushes. &#x3D;) the brushes came fast and they are really soft! perfect for your skin. you can wash them easily too. (: my sister really loved the gift.</li>
    <li> This was a good value. For the price, you shouldn&#x27;t expect perfection. I did think the sponge applicator should have lasted more than one use on one eye, but all in all I thought it was a good deal.</li>
    <li> This thing off-gassed something fearful for about 3 months. I kept it in the back room because of the stench. That said, I haven&#x27;t used any of the products because I&#x27;m a teeny bit scared of what chemicals were used in it&#x27;s production. I should&#x27;ve put it in the trash a long time ago, but now that I&#x27;ve written this review, I think I&#x27;m going to go and throw it away tonight.</li>
    <li> this was a gift to my daughter and she loved the brushes.  she couldn&#x27;t believe what she got for the price I paid</li>
    <li> nice set hairs don&#x27;t fall out like cheep brushes</li>
    <li> A great deal for the brushes.</li>
    <li> This cosmetic makeup brushes were the perfect size.  Great deal for the price!  Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> mine just came in the mail :) i read the reviews and was expecting smaller brushes but they were not as small as i imagined! they also came in early! very happy :)</li>
    <li> Not very good quality.</li>
    <li> Good quality brushes.  I wish they had a concealer brush though.  But they do have a large assortment.  Overall I recommend.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so cheap and they do an amazing job with the makeup. I do not regret at all that I bought these and now applying eye shadow and foundation is awesome.</li>
    <li> They ARE AMAZZZINNGLLYY awesome</li>
    <li> I like it, it work good. For the price I pay work very good.i recommend, I like it Caz it came on time too.</li>
    <li> It is exactly how it looks, great quality and I should order more !!!</li>
    <li> Pretty crappy quality</li>
    <li> Definitely nothing super fancy but they work better than the hand me down brushes I was using before haha. The little brushes are stiff which I life and all the brushes are soft enough~~ Oh and I love the silver case!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re pretty nice, no complaints so far. The large brush it&#x27;s more suited for powders, it&#x27;s very soft and flexible. I wanted them for blending concealer, too bad. The little fold up pouch case is nice too.</li>
    <li> The bag is a cheap leathery material and the brushes are harsh and cheap. When applying my foundation I could see every line where I had brushed this cheap brush on my face. Bad buy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s decebt for the price. The eyebrow/eyelash brush/comb broke. It&#x27;s sort of expected though because again, for the price. Aside from cheapness, the actual brush effectiveness is fine.</li>
    <li> Took like 3 weeks to get here and are not the brushes in the picture</li>
    <li> These are nice.  I have used most of them.  One of the brushes handles came off but I liked the way the way it worked so much that I glued it.  Easy enough.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping A+ thank you</li>
    <li> These brushes are mini size .</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price.  Soft brushes too. Beautiful and handy brush holder.</li>
    <li> The brushes are a great size and the quality is good for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I received this item very fast, within 1-5 days. When I received it my item was packaged well and everything was in good condition. After reviewing the product, I found that all the brushes were relatively soft and durable. I noticed that these brushes are also made with superior quality. If you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on makeup brushes but want something that will do the job right I would recommend these to you.</li>
    <li> Brushes are much smaller than expected !</li>
    <li> The brushes that were supposed to be fluffy did not have that many hairs on them, making them very thin. Although, the first three brushes in the picture worked very well. I was able to fill in and shape my eyebrows easily. I did not really like the &amp;#34;pouch,&amp;#34; and didn&#x27;t end up using it at all. Overall, it was a good product for the price.</li>
    <li> These brushes are nothing special. But they were cheap so I cant complain.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a simple starter kit, I would recommend these.&lt;br /&gt;I love the spoolie that came with this!</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes for the price.The brushes were a little smaller that expected but work all the same,Would defiantly recommend.</li>
    <li> the brushes are alot smaller and thiner then what i expected but the brush are portable and soft</li>
    <li> Good selection,but could have 1 or 2 small softer brushes in collection.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast, only thing I notice when I unwrapped the product was this smell. After a couple days it went away, overall the size is reasonable and the application for these brushes are excellent!</li>
    <li> I use these every day. The kit is very handy to throw into my purse, and protects the brushes well. They are nice, good quality brushes.</li>
    <li> have not picked it up yet but I think it will be as expected.</li>
    <li> Smells like plastic but otherwise great!</li>
    <li> Feels really cheap. I guess you get what you pay for with these.</li>
    <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong. The brushes are soft and have yet to break or anything in the past 3 weeks I&#x27;ve had them. I like the cute silver case although it tied a bit odd. I use these brushes for my eyes mainly and they apply and blend eyeshadow excellently. I would definitely reccomend.</li>
    <li> I love all the brushes because they are very soft and the bristles don&#x27;t fall off like some others do. Came in a cute silver baggy that ties up and good to go when done.</li>
    <li> Received item in good condition.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. Cheap crap.</li>
    <li> Great brush set and better quality than my Bare Escentuals brushes.</li>
    <li> Brushes are very soft, they get the job done.</li>
    <li> It was a good brush for a good price!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.  These brushes are cheap, think and not fluffy.  They do not blend well.  I wouldnt buy them again.</li>
    <li> 3 for now as i havent used all the brushes yet used two so far and they are not bad for the price</li>
    <li> Soft! Works well. Just wish they had more variety.</li>
    <li> Bad quality and tons of shedding. Product really isn&#x27;t worth buying, I have no idea why there are such good reviews on it.</li>
    <li> The Brushes Are Great , Except I Recvieved Them A Month Later . However They Are Pretty Good &amp; But a bit smaller than I thought.</li>
    <li> this is GREAATT, so soft the poblem is the size of the biggest brush i suppose is for blush or defined powder, anyway who cares the size, i think is for a basic makeup kit theyre great and not exprenssive at all, is in your house maybe in a month</li>
    <li> The brushes are very soft! The little thing to hold the brushes doesn&#x27;t really have good quality, but i could make it work. Other than that, its pretty good!</li>
    <li> My daughter was very pleased with these brushes.  Turns out to be a very high quality brush set.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t not like one brush in this set and that is the fluffy brush, does not get the job done right.</li>
    <li> The price for these brushes is hard to beat. I was excited to use them; however, they came with a very strong off-putting odor like paint. I have been hesitant to use them and trying to give them some time to air out first.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why people are saying they are small, they are the perfect NORMAL size ! I love these and can&#x27;t wait to use them. (although they took FOREVER to get here, my least favorite part)</li>
    <li> faster shipping....it&#x27;s nice</li>
    <li> Decent quality brushes for the price.  I&#x27;ve been using them for a few weeks now and don&#x27;t notice any stray brush hairs in my make-up which is always nice.  I bought this mainly for the eye brushes, specifically the angle brush which I use to apply a very nice, narrow line of cream eyeliner into my lashline.  It&#x27;s works great.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re a great set of brushes with super soft tips that applied my makeup well. My mother is very envious of them.</li>
    <li> I only use like three of the brushes. I do not use the blush brush because I like a firmer brush to apply blush on my cheeks. They are of good quality and I usually wash them with antibacterial soap afterwards and the brushes have not changed from their original form.</li>
    <li> I am sure my granddaughters will like these. Especially good for starting out with  makeup. delivery prompt. thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Good brushes for low price handle is loose on one but i managed</li>
    <li> Great value for the money.</li>
    <li> The bristles in the brush feel ok but the brushes are much shorter normal brushes. But I keep them in my permanently packed travel kit so they fit fine. And they were a good price.</li>
    <li> These brushes were actually better than what I thought I just knew they were gonna be crappy.. They are cheap &amp; they get the job done..</li>
    <li> After reading mixed reviews for these brushes I decided to order a few sets and try them out for myself. I&#x27;m happy to say they were better then I expected.They&#x27;re definitely better then anything you can buy at any of the big box stores for this price point.  As far as the smell,  yes I did notice a little wiff of plastic when I first opened the set.  I do believe that was because I was making a point to smell the brushesn instead of just using them.  I left the sets opened and uncovered the brushes and when I checked them in the morning the smell was gone.&lt;br /&gt;When I first used the brushes I was pleasantly surprised at how soft they were. I even gave them a vigorous washing and didn&#x27;t have any issues with bristles falling out so I&#x27;m glad I ordered them instead of waiting to find another budget friendly option. I like the fact that I can multiple brush sets for what it used to cost me for just 1 brush. I will be reordering for myself and a few sets to give to friends who I&#x27;m sure will want them once they see me using my set.</li>
    <li> I am stunned  with the performance of these brushes. Im so inlove with it. Im not expecting too much for it because of the price but they are really good for me.</li>
    <li> Love it brushes are very soft and worth the price</li>
    <li> Nicer than nice. Best brushes I have. And I have a lot.</li>
    <li> I expected a spooly eyebrow brush, but they sent a bigger eyeshadow brush. I&#x27;m not too disappointed, though, and the brushes are very nice. I like the small size, it&#x27;s good for travel or school. the hair is very soft, unlike my other brushes, which hurt to put on. A few hairs come out if I pull, but that&#x27;s expected. very good, for the price.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great!  There is a brush for anything you need for your face.  My makeup looks like it was done by a professional.</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift she liked them</li>
    <li> I have always loved makeup and it wasn&#x27;t until recently that i started using make up brushes. This is my first set of brushes ever, but i must say i absolutely LOVE them. The brushes are soft, the hairs don&#x27;t fall out, and they pick up the pigments in shadows, blushes, and bronzers. I would absolutely recommend this brushes, especially if you&#x27;re using them to practice with or a first time user.</li>
    <li> The bag that the brush come in smells horrible. I cleaned the brushes so the smell was gone from them. Not bad product. I thought they were going to be bigger. Its more for a beginner or a kid. Nothing fancy but good price.</li>
    <li> Feels films but does the job</li>
    <li> I received the package, I like the quality of the brushes.. I received in Pink. It was nice... the only thing I didnt like its that I pick this for the angle brown brush.. and mine didnt included that one...</li>
    <li> My wife really likes this set. The bristles don&#x27;t come out when you use them, and she says it has every brush you could want. Great price too!</li>
    <li> awesome! everything came as expected. The brushes seem to be of great quality and the bag is very nice.&lt;br /&gt; awesome</li>
    <li> Nice set of brushes.. Brushes were as i thought they would be and came in a nice carrying case. Would recommend to friends and family</li>
    <li> I was very happy with these brushes. When they first arrived in their plastic covering, I was afraid the blush brush would be a little skimpy.  Once the plastic sleeve was removed, it had a nice, full shape.</li>
    <li> The brushes were smaller than I expected but they were good quality brushes and I was impressed when I received them</li>
    <li> This is a very nice assortment of brushes wirh an even nicer silver wrap n roll holder. Perfect for home and travel.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend and may even repurchase as Christmas gifts!</li>
    <li> I bought 2 sets of these brushes for my daughter and daughter in law.  They absolutely loved them.  I was pleased with the purchase and would definitely purchase from this company again</li>
    <li> Received a light pink case instead of silver, which is a little disappointing since I don&#x27;t like pink. The brushes smell a bit funky, but overall you get what you paid for, 3 bucks isn&#x27;t a big deal. I still really wish I got that silver bag tho..</li>
    <li> This is just amazing and its so cheap, only problem is that it&#x27;s easy to break but fixed it with glue gun</li>
    <li> Order came weeks early! Great quality (: the brushes to not fall apart as you use them! I love them(:</li>
    <li> professional quality!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to wearing makeup and wanted to get a set that wasn&#x27;t expensive since I was just starting. This worked well for my needs and I now use it often.</li>
    <li> Use it everyday. thanks</li>
    <li> This set is perfect! some say the brushes are to small but i think they are just the right size and i had a few brushes already and when i got this set i could put them all together in the case which i like. the brushes themselves are very soft and work very well. i can stop brushing the blush brush on my face. This is a great price for a great product if you ask me.</li>
    <li> When I received this there was such a harsh chemical smell that I can&#x27;t even use it! Don&#x27;t waste your money and I would not use these on my face.</li>
    <li> The 7 pcs brush set fixs into my budget the brushs work will&lt;br /&gt;on my face .I rated this product 4 stars this a great product.</li>
    <li> Cheap, smelly, flimsy brushes</li>
    <li> Excellent brushes! Very pleased</li>
    <li> Very nice for the price</li>
    <li> For the price these are great brushes for someone who is starting out with makeup. It does take awhile for them to get here but I guess it is coming across seas. Overall, I am not disappointed.</li>
    <li> lots of different sizes and comes in a nice travel pouch. Makes a nice gift or to have replacements for yourself.</li>
    <li> The brushes I received rent exactly professional quality but they will work for what I need it for they still serve their purpose</li>
    <li> I love them they are so soft an work very well</li>
    <li> I like them a lot for the price there good I would recomend it good but would buy it  again</li>
    <li> the tools itself are better than I expected. I have not used it yet, so I will see how long it last. shipped from Singapore, which surprised me. the bag is ok.thanks</li>
    <li> Was thrilled about the product when I first ordered it but I guess I should&#x27;ve know better ordering products like this from another country. It never came so it was a pretty bad experience. No bueno.</li>
    <li> Got them super fast, loved them</li>
    <li> These brushes are very soft which I love; unfortunately, they smell a bit odd. They almost smell like chemicals so I would highly recommend washing them before use.</li>
    <li> I like the product, the brushes are soft, threads do not fall from them. I would recommend this brushes to you.</li>
    <li> Took a while to get to me but the brushes are soft and work really well. I didn&#x27;t have any issues with them smelling badly or missing pieces.</li>
    <li> I love it! very good quality! I can&#x27;t imagine I can buy such a good make up brush with this price! Thanks for the notes, it&#x27;s very sweet!</li>
    <li> The brushes are great and are a wonderful price.nice travel pouch with different brushes . I really like this product</li>
    <li> when I first got it, it had a strong nasty smell but its an ok brushes. The brushes work fine the hairs hasn&#x27;t come off yet.</li>
    <li> I got the brushes for myself and a friend. We both love them. They are exactly what I expected them to be. Thanks for the fast delivery.</li>
    <li> As a beginner just now getting into makeup I didn&#x27;t know what types of brushes I would need. I researched and saw what I needed, but when going out to buy the good quality brushes I found that most were expensive. This is easy and cheap. I love it and I&#x27;m sure anybody else would love it as well.</li>
    <li> Plastic bag smells kind of funny, though the brushes seem like they are of good quality. Great to give as gifts.</li>
    <li> I would have given it five stars but the shipping is too long and I ordered four sets adn in one set I was missing a piece.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed all the different sizes of the brushes. They all are built to last and the case is very convenient!&lt;br /&gt;The shipping came early too! I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This has everything you need for modern make up these days-its comes with a very nice tote so you always can keep it together and not lose them.</li>
    <li> I would give this a zero but you must select a rating to be able to type a review.  I received the two other products that were offered when ordering this product.  Very disappointed now I have to spend more money for my daughter to have brushes to go with the makeup I got her for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Great product and very cheap price! Completely satisfied and was exactly what I was looking for. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Great! Gave them to my mom as a present! She really needed brushes and these worked great! So I support this product! She has not complained!</li>
    <li> Awesome brushes for the price, I wasn&#x27;t expecting this much quality. I have been using them for a couple of weeks now and I have no problems with it, no shedding or breaking. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was waiting on the product (almost 3 weeks), I&#x27;m an impatient person so it didn&#x27;t help lol, that&#x27;s why I gave it a 4 stars.</li>
    <li> The brushes are great and are a wonderful price.  The silver roll up bag is cute, but it smelled strongly of gasoline when it arrived.  I had to air it out for several days for the smell to disappear.  Other than that, I love the product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be a 7pcs set yet I only got 6pcs delivered; I was kinda disappointed, but the price was AMAZING and the brushes that I DID get were very sturdy and great quality. I would recommend this set for beginners and teens.</li>
    <li> For the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting the quite decent quality of these. They are solidly well-made, the case too. Really glad I gave them a shot over buying more expensive ones.</li>
    <li> loved them .....&lt;br /&gt;perfect size brushes good quality lovedd the colors perfect for a trip easy to handle fits perfect on my purse</li>
    <li> The design seemed kind of cheap but they worked so if you&#x27;re looking for less expensive brush get these.</li>
    <li> This product looks nice but I couldn&#x27;t use all the brushes.  The brushes had a very strong chemical scent.  I&#x27;m not usually sensitive to strong scents, but the chemical scent was too strong for me.  I was only able to use the eyebrow brushes.  The only reason I kept the product and didn&#x27;t return it, was because I really liked the silver carrying case they came in.  The case works really well for travel and it looks nice.</li>
    <li> Everything came on time and is in good condition! Came with a little grey holder and they were all in plastic covers. Works good, too!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great! they do not shed at all I&#x27;ve had mine for 5 months now and I&#x27;ve washed them many many times,they still look great I just love them!</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes and case for the low price!  Wow!</li>
    <li> Love this set.  A brush for every need!</li>
    <li> I like the brushes they are soft and easy to use. They arrived in good condition, but I didn&#x27;t like that it smelled had to air them out so the smell would go away. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The brushes were really amazing however they should be glued together better the two plastic parts started to come undone</li>
    <li> Love this brush set.  And what I paid for it.  Could hardly believe the value. Went to the Vegas Strip for 10 days packed them along. They were so easy to pack and unpack.  Love this set and would highly recommend to anyone. Who wears makeup everyday.</li>
    <li> I am happy with these as a starter set with a lot of missing starter items. I&#x27;m still figuring out exactly what I can use all of them for, since they are a bit smaller than I expected (brush wise).&lt;br /&gt;The blush/powder brush is a bit flattened, so it might be better for contouring(how i decided to use it).&lt;br /&gt;The bigger eyeshadow applicator brush is very firm, flat, and doesn&#x27;t have very many bristles in it. Its a bit to firm to do any sort of soft looks.&lt;br /&gt;The smaller eyeshadow applicator brush is so small, I don&#x27;t quite know what to do with it yet. Maybe it could be used for very precise things like concealing blemishes or something like that?&lt;br /&gt;The angled brush is pretty nice, but a tad bit small (however that doesn&#x27;t make too much of a difference). It&#x27;s firm enough for eyeliner works and one of my preferred brushes from this set. I like it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;The sponge applicator is pleasant. It does it&#x27;s job very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;The mascara-like brush is fantastic for doing eyebrows, and evening out eyelashes. Its not uncomfortably firm, but maneuvers eyebrow hair and eyelashes perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;The eyebrow/eyelash combo brush is okay. The brush part is small, and thin, so it takes a bit longer to work with. The comb part is like almost any comb you would get from an eyebrow/eyelash combo brush, but maybe a bit firmer.&lt;br /&gt;The package is an appealing silver with no smell. The brush cover on the inside is satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;Over all, the price speaks for the set. It&#x27;s not bad, but not excellent.</li>
    <li> Smelled badly when I opened it like it was laying in paint for years.  Threw it in the trash right away.</li>
    <li> Very soft i really like them</li>
    <li> Great brush set, especially for beginners. Kinda was hoping the blush brush would&#x27;ve been bigger, but all in all a great buy for the low price.</li>
    <li> Took a while to get , but love the brushes &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I loved these brushes. They were extremely soft and I was not expecting such high quality for such a low price. I definitely recommend these. The star that I took off was just a small issue I had with occasional shedding but overall I think these brushes were a great buy</li>
    <li> CHEAPLY MADE!!! not worth the money. fell apart in first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***still have the cause for my new brushes</li>
    <li> The brush pouch is so elegant it goes perfectly with the brush set. Brushes are easy to clean and very soft to use. Its so easy to store and its not space consuming.good quality and it doesn&#x27;t have after smell even i used it so many time.</li>
    <li> These are great brushes, I did not expect such quality with such a low price.</li>
    <li> I bought this one for my sister. She liked it very much.. the brushes were strong and soft.. the product delivered on time.. will recommend..</li>
    <li> I like this set a lot. Obviously not the highest quality however they do the job.</li>
    <li> Obviously these are not high quality, everyday brushes. They are good to throw in your purse or just to have extra brushes.. they are small size, and soft brushes. Took a star off due to a brush head falling off the handle.</li>
    <li> brushes seems study, no issues with weak bristles. saw it was made in china when i received it but its not cheaply made</li>
    <li> It took a while to get here but it&#x27;s just as described and great quality for the price. The brushes are not mini like some other reviewers posted.</li>
    <li> i loved the bag it came in, i&#x27;m starting to learn more about make up and this is exciting :)</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing so glad I bought them very well made great price nice carrying case I just love this set!!</li>
    <li> Purchased these for my sister as a christmas present. It arrived a few weeks after which wasn&#x27;t a big deal. When she got them, they had a chemical smell like some brushes so they needed to be aired out. But the bristles are very soft. I don&#x27;t think they shed. Good, cheap brushes for beginners or for those who don&#x27;t use makeup that often.</li>
    <li> Great item for a GREAT price. Make up brushes now a days are becoming expensive. This product is as described at a low cost. Great quality too!</li>
    <li> I like it. Good price for good quality</li>
    <li> By &amp;#34;a problem&amp;#34; I mean reeking of spray paint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously. It smells like spray paint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are really soft and effective and I love them, but the case...</li>
    <li> These brushes work really well. I thought that they would be cheep and fall apart but they act like high quality brushes</li>
    <li> Love it nice easy very useful I love all.the brush light and I would say very get brushes to use</li>
    <li> Dont waste your money. These were the most horrible brushes by far that I have ever used! First, they took forever to arrive. Then, as soon as I opened them I got a strong wif of a chemical smell. They smell so bad like chemicals. Then,  I tried washing them how I always was my brushes, and one of the brush heads fell off completely! !! HORRIBLE</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, they are a must have for any makeup lover, nice size and work great, i always look forward to using them!</li>
    <li> i thought these brushes and i like how light they are and very soft, have not used them yet but i cant wait</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured, decent quality, cute carrying case.</li>
    <li> Nice! They did their job.</li>
    <li> Idk why I bought this when I have a make-up case already but I&#x27;m guessing it would be good for people on the go.</li>
    <li> For the money, these seem to be nice brushes.  They have been purchased for a niece for Christmas, so she has not yet used them.</li>
    <li> I was totally surprised at how well made the brushes were at the price I paid for them. Pleasantly pleased with the product!</li>
    <li> I was able to get this item for just a few dollars and I&#x27;m glad it didn&#x27;t cost more. The brushes are low quality but the case has made them ideal for travel. With infrequent use, the brushes have remained in decent condition.</li>
    <li> It was okay.&lt;br /&gt;Not to bad for it&#x27;s worth, but it&#x27;s a bit of a hassle to apply with the material of the brushes.</li>
    <li> I love these sets. Makes a great gift as well...cuz what woman couldn&#x27;t use these!</li>
    <li> Terrible...long to ship, case smelled funny - ended up throwing them out as they each fell apart.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, the price was not bad at all. Although I was a little weary about some of the reviews but I decided to take a chance anyway and I&#x27;m glad I did. however they are the perfect size they are longer than my hand, they did come in a tie up case an I love that each one have a protective sleeve over them. They do have a smell but once u hand wash them with soap they a fine👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾 over all great product an I received it way before the promised time.</li>
    <li> Brushes were a little smaller than expected but they&#x27;re great quality and arrived with no issues</li>
    <li> Love this!  Would love another set.</li>
    <li> Mainly bought this for the angled brush, It works very well. All brushes ass good quality. This is a good starter makeup brush kit.</li>
    <li> these are great and the little holding case is great for traveling or keeping your stuff organized and neat and tidy</li>
    <li> The brushes aren&#x27;t as great. Shader brush is doable, but the face brush is horrible. Clean your brushes before you actually use them. They somewhat smelled when they got to me.</li>
    <li> I was a bit on the fence about this purchase ddue to price. BUT have to say it was great the brushes are stiff where they need to be etc. I am so happy I found these!</li>
    <li> Awesome quality for cheap price!! Very impressed will defenety encourage other people to buy this product!!  Again they are super good quality especially for the price.</li>
    <li> very good brushes for price. love the case. very soft and useful. i use these over my mac brushes. they are a must</li>
    <li> Just simply amazing and such a wonderful price&lt;br /&gt;And so easy to use  love the roll out case it came with</li>
    <li> I ordered these on a Saturday. They arrived the following Thursday. It was ridiculously fast, and the brushes are lovely! I&#x27;ve used them a few times now, and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any shedding or splintering. They&#x27;re definitely worth the few dollars.&lt;br /&gt;In stores, you&#x27;d pay $20 for the same set. Highly recommended! I&#x27;m really hoping these last, because I absolutely adore them. And the cute carrying case is a total plus!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t think the brushes would be so effective but I was wrong I love them!! Very good for the price.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really know, this was a gift for my aunt but she didn&#x27;t want it anymore. Tried contacting the seller, but due to Chinese New Year they never returned my message.</li>
    <li> A little disappointed with this purchase but the brushes work</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy unless you have will need them in 6 weeks . Takes over a month to get here . Crap ! Will not order again .</li>
    <li> I have been wearing makeup more often because of how much I love these brushes! I would definitely recommend them to every woman!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an alright product. Least it comes with a bag. lol. A few bristles came out of one of the brushes.. If you don&#x27;t use them much it should be fine. When you clean them bristles may fall out.</li>
    <li> The brushes are in very good quality! Everyone said they smelled and they were right but it went away right away so its not a big deal. The brushes took FOREVER to get here... they took 2 months to be exact. But I guess it wasn&#x27;t the sellers fault and he gave me a refund and let me keep the brushes so thank you to them!</li>
    <li> Just as described. Works great!</li>
    <li> It don´t have tracking ID, it´s so complicated to consolidate, I think it´s important advice the customers that don´t have tracking number before sale.</li>
    <li> the brushes came fast and were really cool but the brushes went as soft as I thought they were gonna be and the hairs frome the brush sometimes fall out while applying makeup. I would say 2/1.2 if I could</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price! Shipped quickly! The little case it comes in is nice as well. Don&#x27;t be afraid to buy!</li>
    <li> This is a small (short) set of brushes. Definately not the quality I was looking for. I am disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Great set of make up brushes , even better price ! They also make a great. gift. Every size and shape you will need.</li>
    <li> I actually forgot about ordering this set of brushes and the fact that they did not come for Christmas as planned the quality is made up for it.  I like the compact size for travel which fit with the trip I am about to take and will be giving these brushes a workout.  I feel every brush in this set is just the right size for it&#x27;s job with good quality materials.</li>
    <li> Not bad but smelled weird when they came out of package after cleaning them they were fine. They definitely should be washed before use.</li>
    <li> The brushes were small, yes, but you get what you pay for. They work wonderfully - the only brush that doesn&#x27;t was the biggest one, all of the hairs fell out... Otherwise, it was a good buy! Cute starter brushes!</li>
    <li> Smelly Plastic overpowering , sheds and two brushes broke off, the brushes are also short in length</li>
    <li> It only came with 3/7 pieces.</li>
    <li> For such a cheap price, I was expecting these to be really low quality, but I love them so far! Great variety and good quality.</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes. It give the main brushes you would need for basic makeup application. Great product! definitely would recommend to a friend</li>
    <li> I love this set. I am new at doing make up and don&#x27;t have the money top get a super expensive kit, and so I decided to try this. TOTALLY GLAD I DID! The powder brush is super soft, but can hold powder, and the liner and shadow brushes are soft and apply reaaaalllyyy nicely. I would advise getting this!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice set for first timers..decent quality the price was ok for what came with it..</li>
    <li> The brushes aren&#x27;t bad, if you are looking for really good quality brushes, I wouldn&#x27;t go for these. They are great for travel though!</li>
    <li> Arrived early, everything came intact, in their own little space. Great buy for the right price.</li>
    <li> I picked this up on a deal of the day. Super cheap! The brushes are not bad.</li>
    <li> Mine came in pink. I hate pink</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not full size or what I expecte. But it&#x27;s OK for ur car or ur make up bag.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant about buying these brushes after reading a few of the reviews but I am so glad I purchased them.  They are normal sized brushes.  They are durable, soft yet firm and do not shed.  They come individually wrapped in a great silver case.  It took about 2 weeks to receive them which was quick to me.  I would definitely purchase from this buyer again.</li>
    <li> The product was just as it was described and well packed than i expected. i strongly recommend i-Supplies. good job</li>
    <li> Nice brushes and I liked the pouch they came in. They fit in my purse for quick touch ups perfect size.</li>
    <li> Deff worth the money. Amazing!!! The big brush is so soft and blends so perfect. But it fell in my toilet so maddd. Need to get one back. Great buy. Fantastic!! Had it for 2 months now. Brushes still fanatstic. Buy it ppl.</li>
    <li> excellent quality brushes, i would highly recommend them. fantastic product, well well well worth the price, ive used them for about a month now before i would review them and they are definitely high quality.</li>
    <li> I love the brushes, the makeup bag was a little weird but i just thru them all in my make-up bag anyways lol.</li>
    <li> The case this arrived in felt like fake plastic-y leather, especially with the silver paint on it. But I didn&#x27;t buy this for the case- which is still very useful to keep all the brushes straight.&lt;br /&gt;The big brush comes with a plastic sheath so it doesn&#x27;t get frayed out of shape. All the eye brushes are great- they pick up the eyeshadow, and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m painting my eye with an ice pick. I can&#x27;t speak for the mascara tools, but the brushes rinse clean easily.</li>
    <li> Bad smell and low quality brushes</li>
    <li> Very stinky wasted my money</li>
    <li> works good for me i think they&#x27;re great brushes.</li>
    <li> For the price, these brushes are well worth the purchase. The handle of the brush is a lot shorter than I would prefer - if you are storing yours in a small vase or jar, they hardly stick out above of an average mason jar rim. Otherwise, so far they don&#x27;t lose their bristles during use and considering the seven pieces, they are versatile when applying different kinds of makeup. It didn&#x27;t really include a good smudging brush, but I&#x27;ve been using one of the smaller brushes as one and it works fairly well. Overall, very good value for the price.</li>
    <li> I just received these brushes and tried them out. They are absolutely great for how inexpensive they are.  The brushes are soft and great for travel.  I used a eye makeup primer with the brushes however they work well without the primer.  They are compact and I like the case that it comes in.  The only thing you will need to buy is extra eyeshadow smudge sponges to replace the one brush after awhile.  Overall great product.</li>
    <li> Very good. I use it every day. I can bring it in my purse or briefcase. I was not disappointed.</li>
    <li> This one was very likable and enjoyable. Nothing was damaged and was great for the price. very nice to use.</li>
    <li> Super set and a great buy compared to stores.</li>
    <li> Great! Just what I was looking for!!</li>
    <li> For the price i paid these brushes were a great deal! Not only did it come with 7 different brushes but a cute bag case came with it. Def a great starter brush set!</li>
    <li> funny packaging smell, but overall great value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d Give it a four to five star.  Bought it as one of my sister&#x27;s Christmas present.  Haven&#x27;t tested it out yet but the packaging was decent.  It came in a bag with NO bubble wrap but came in GOOD condition though.  Checked all the brushes and pulled quite hard at the bristle&#x27;s and only one or two pieces of hair came off.  I was impressed. ;] One of the brushes were kind of wobbly, but  it wasn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. But their ok.</li>
    <li> I received them in about a week. They were exactly what I wanted and expected them to be. Very nice, not cheap looking or feeling. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. :)</li>
    <li> I gave this to my 16 year old daughter to introduce her to the world of using brush sets. It&#x27;s a good set for a beginner.</li>
    <li> Very professional looking and both my daughter and daughter in law were so excited to have them and ready to try them out.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my daughter, but they were much nicer than I expected for the price and so am buying two more sets!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes and the price was nice as well. But I was expecting them to be a bit larger but it&#x27;s okay!</li>
    <li> I was surprised these brushes were nice, considering I paid under two dollars for them.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are soft and flexible. Good quality. I am happy with this purchase and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Very nice starter set! Most impressed with the foundation brush. I like the case quite a bit too, very functional.</li>
    <li> I needed some new brushes and the variety this kit provided was wonderful. The case makes it great to pack up and travel. Very compact.</li>
    <li> It has every type of brush I need and is in a good looking container  It is good when traveling.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of these brushes. The bristles of the shadow brush we stuck together when  first got them and had to loosen it myself by literally pounding it into a flat surface repeatedly! A head of them are a bit small though, can&#x27;t really use the large 1 as an all over face brush, great for blush though, &amp; it feels sooooo good on skin. I&#x27;d recommend to people who just want 2 get their feet wet. Not bad at all.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quality and size is not worse than I expected, but it&#x27;s okey. I am not using. jhbh jhb jhb</li>
    <li> I bought this product when the price was about $1.50 so I wasn&#x27;t expecting great quality. Considering the price, it is more than a decent brush set. The brush bag looks very tacky but does the job. The biggest brush had this bad smell to it at first but after i cleaned it with my brush cleaner the smell faded. The brushes are all quite stiff with exception to the blush brush and they are all surprisingly soft. They look cheap but the bristles are not bad at all. None of the bristles have fallen out yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: 9/21/2013&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for about half a year and they are very good quality. I&#x27;m surprised to say that still, none of the bristles have fallen out. I use 5 of these brushes often and they are still quite stiff but they have their own uses. They are also travel size which I love because I can easily carry my favorite brushes in my makeup bag. I always carry my real techniques, eco tools and one of these brushes with me at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is with the bag. I left the brushes in the bag when I first purchased them and I&#x27;m not sure exactly what happened, but it looks like the bag melted onto my brushes. luckily it&#x27;s only on the wood part so it didn&#x27;t ruin the brushes, but I can feel it ever time i use them.</li>
    <li> good product, I use it every day for my makeup, and the blush brush is really soft. The eyebrow brush is useful too</li>
    <li> I bought 2 sets of these brushes, one for me and one for a gift.  The package came in a mailing bag, 2 sets, ok but as soon as I opened the plastic bag in came in. it was full of some kind of oil and it smelled like gas. I opened the silver bag the brushes came in and they were also fill with this oil. I am not about to put this brushes in my eyes or face, what is this substance? I contact the seller because I want to returned them not only for the oil and smell but the eyebrow brush one on kit was broken. There was hairs from the brush all over my floor, table, the whole thing just fell apart. Dealing with the seller has been a nightmare that I have never encounter in my life. He wants a picture, so I send one and he is still insisting in a picture. Is this person insinuating I did this damage? I would not recommend anyone to buy from these company, ever. You would think it was so much money, but is 7 dollars and change. Go figure. First time I have a bad experience with a seller in all my years buying at Amazon.</li>
    <li> The picture makes it look like these are normal sized brushes, while they are almost considered mini compared to the ones you would buy alone.</li>
    <li> I just love these makeup brushes, they&#x27;re super cheap and get the job done. The wrap for them is also nice. Definitely a superb buy for the price.</li>
    <li> I definitely recommend these brushes because they work really well and definitely do last.  Works like true professional brushes without having to spend so much.  Great for traveling as well in its cute little pack!</li>
    <li> I LOVE the blending brush! It is firm, and I am in LOVE with the crease brush! I would buy this again, especially since the silver case is super cute! I received this item at a discounted rate for an honest review.</li>
    <li> If you are new to makeup then this is a great beginner set. It comes with the essentials you need to get started. They are not the greatest quality but good enough for the price.</li>
    <li> its nice for this price if you buy in store it will cost you more than ten $</li>
    <li> Awesome brunches , awesome quality !!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are absolutely fabulous! I just started using them and I can&#x27;t tell too much of a difference between these and my MAC brushes that I spent over $100 on. The seller was also great, I got them even earlier than anticipated. I just ordered my second set! :)</li>
    <li> I paid $1.17 for these brushes and really wasn&#x27;t&#x27; t expecting anything spectacular, but they have proven to be great little brushes. I have used them for about a month with no shedding and they are very soft. I would definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect little kit. It comes in a great little pouch that is perfect for travel.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Extremely soft love it all together.</li>
    <li> The brushes are real soft</li>
    <li> these are great but sadly I found it a bit tedious to keep up with the bag so many of them got lost but I will be purchasing more from this seller and this time I will keep up with them</li>
    <li> Very cheap material! Some brushes were broken</li>
    <li> Love love love it!!!!!! &amp; they&#x27;re super soft!</li>
    <li> I bought these because I was in urgent need of brushes, but not a lot of $ in my Amazon account.  Very glad I did.  I was going to use these as a back up.  They are my main brushes!</li>
    <li> perfect exactly what i wanted! and needed some new brushes</li>
    <li> Bought these as a gift for me. Love the different size brushes &amp; the little case that come with it.</li>
    <li> these brushes work well. they arrived in new condition &amp; timely manner as promised.</li>
    <li> Product was much smaller than anticipated. The holder for the brushes is nice but didn&#x27;t realize the brushes were going to be so small.. might be difficult to even use some</li>
    <li> The items were to be part of a Christmas gift and although I received notification that they would be late, because of the time allotted I had high hopes that they would arrive just in time.  On Christmas Eve I was forced to make other arrangement.  To my surprise I found comparable replacements at Wal-Mart for the same price.  Today that same item is is on clearance at Wal-Mart for 50% off that original bargin price.  So, lesson learned, unless I can&#x27;t find the product at my local department store because of it&#x27;s uniqueness, I will choose to my local vendors.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know whether i like them or not because i haven&#x27;t received it yet.i ordered it especially for the eyelash comb but i will be using the other brushes too if and when i receive them.</li>
    <li> like the compact travel pack and brushes are smoothe and easy to wash</li>
    <li> These were supposed to be a gift. If you are really into makeup don&#x27;t purchase these, they are very basic. If you only wear makeup once in a blue moon, then by all mean indulge in the cheapness. It took ages to arrive.</li>
    <li> The product smells toxic, both tools and container smells very bad.  I am not able to comment on the use of the tools because I can&#x27;t get over the smell.</li>
    <li> Received product today, it was an xmas gift for my daughter, a little late.......!!! Ordered it from Cosy Zone - CHINA&lt;br /&gt;The ordering info was deceiving, it has since been corrected for Cosy Zone when ordering it mentions ships in 2 days but won&#x27;t be received for 8-10 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;As others stated products smells-over powering, but hopefully it will dissipate.&lt;br /&gt;They appear to be constructed ok.  Time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;Before ordering check the supplier for delivery time, mine came from china on slow boat!!!Literally.&lt;br /&gt;I have had other things come from China and had it in 3 weeks.  I actually ordered something 2 weeks after this and it came in 2 weeks ago from china.&lt;br /&gt;Will update once my daughter uses it for a product review, then I will remove the one star rating or leave it</li>
    <li> I really like this cosmetic brush set! I gave it for a gift :) she liked it ... The brushes are *Soft :)</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any shedding of the brushes they are very sturdy and they were packed very nicely. Honestly if you are looking for something cheap sturdy and doesn&#x27;t shed this is a good pack for you it even came with a silver carrying case which I absolutely love because it keeps them all together and is great for when I&#x27;m traveling.</li>
    <li> For the price, the brushes are great.  And the roll up case it came in is really cute!  I bought one for my daughter too.</li>
    <li> Gave it as a gift. My sister went crazy over it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much with the price being so low.  I have never used many makeup brushes, so I&#x27;m no expert.  I thought the brushes might not be very soft, but they are great.  Would definitely recommend and purchase again if needed.  I am very pleased with these.  The case is great, too- has a top flap to keep brushes clean when not in use.  Well worth it.</li>
    <li> Loved it! I have never owned a make up tool kit before, but so far its perfect for my needs. The cute little bag is a plus too.</li>
    <li> Good brushes, quality is good</li>
    <li> I love this set, specially the fanned brush.  It helps cover everything.  The brushes are great for everything you need to have the best makeup ever.</li>
    <li> I just love these brushes because they sre so portable with the bag and they are just one of the best brushes I hsve used</li>
    <li> I have had these for a while now and the hair doesn&#x27;t shed and they apply the makeup perfectly. Doesn&#x27;t really have a eyeshadow brush but It does work great.</li>
    <li> The brushes are smaller than I thought they would be. They are pretty good for the price. It does take a while to receive them in the mail.</li>
    <li> The brushes bristles were very soft and easy to break in. Not a hair has come out of place and keeps my makeup looking fresh! I love these brushes!</li>
    <li> I bought these on a whim with little money left from a gift card. I had read some of the reviews and they all looked decent. So I got them. When they arrived, there was a bit of fake leather, plastic smell (thats not a big deal at all) which you can expect from anything  plastic or fake leather being shipped. I washed them before using them and they are SO soft. I recommend these brushes if you&#x27;re low on money and need some brushes to carry with you for travel or (if your like me) to take with you in case your FX makeup brushes fail you when you need them.</li>
    <li> I love this kit. I am no good at makeup, so I felt good paying this money to try and get better. The carrying case is nice.</li>
    <li> these brushes are not so bad. the only thing that I don&#x27;t care for is that they are stiff and sometimes it&#x27;s hard to use when applying make up. but it does apply the right amount and the look still comes out acceptable. they are nice and portable and easy to store. they are easy to clean and dry fast as well.</li>
    <li> They work nicely for the price.</li>
    <li> The title says it all.  for this cheap price I was very skeptical but the brushes are great quality, don&#x27;t shed, and are VERY SOFT.  I use the big brush for blush and the one with the white tip for eyeshadow, although I don&#x27;t really know what it&#x27;s supposed to be used for.  I&#x27;m no makeup artist so it would have been helpful to know which brush is used for what.  I don&#x27;t really use most of the other brushes but that&#x27;s my own problem; the quality is good.</li>
    <li> They are soft and I like them, but I expect them to be a little bit longer. but to me they are consider mini</li>
    <li> Brushes are very good quality and definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> Nice set of makeup brushes in a fold-up silver carrying case.  Brushes seem good quality ... will know more after several uses.  Seem nice quality for the price.</li>
    <li> that middle brush was super crappy</li>
    <li> Ordered mine on May 17, received it on May 28. The product looks just like the photo AND it included the 7 correct pieces. The color looks just right. I would buy this again!</li>
    <li> I still get nothing!! :@</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great just and what I needed! They took a very long time for shipping but they&#x27;re definitely worth the price and are pretty sturdy.</li>
    <li> arrived in the time period it said it would arrive but barely came in like 2 weeks which for me is a lengthy time period. overall the brushes were a bit small</li>
    <li> Just got this today, I like it. I think some of the brushes are a little odd and I wouldn&#x27;t use them. Overall, this is an okay set. For being so cheap, it&#x27;s not bad. I didn&#x27;t smell what others did, just a fresh wood smell. But, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
    <li> They are very nice, very soft brushes just as I expected... 😍😍😘🙌💝</li>
    <li> The packaging was good. But after opening it there was an overwhelming order, i think the smell came from the material/fabric the bag is made of. I am airing the bag out hopefully the bad scent goes away but the brushes seem fine though, i may wash them before is used them. just to be on the safe side.</li>
    <li> They are very sturdy and stylish  Thank you very much would definetely recommend to friends and family keep it up</li>
    <li> i bought this and i thought it did a very fair job the smaller brushes are a bit to stiff but the powder brush is really nice and so is the carrying case but stiff isnt bad especially if your using a gel eyeliner</li>
    <li> I was looking for brushes that were inexpensive but did the job. I got this for a steal. The quality is great, and the price was even better. ​</li>
    <li> I never got them in the mail. Do not get these. You will not be happy with them. Its a load of bull!</li>
    <li> Definitely a Bit smaller than I expected. Still pretty decent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good to have for on the go, everything basic is in one soft case (which I like),  as for the word &amp;#34;Professional&amp;#34; they need to re-think on that...</li>
    <li> nothing special about these. Easy to take along if you travel a lot</li>
    <li> The case is pretty, the brushes look nice.  I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but I think they are going to be great!</li>
    <li> I bought these on a whim since they were so cheap. They will hold up for emergencies, like a touch up in the car, but not for everyday use.</li>
    <li> YAHOOOOOO,,,I had no idea that these brushes will be so awesome and prize are so cheap.  thank you so much crazy cart.</li>
    <li> These are a m a z i n g ! I Love them and i will be buying more as gifts. My mom buys expensive brushes and mine are waaay softer . Also her&#x27;s broke within the first few days . Mine lasted after 6 months! &amp; their easy to clean! GET NOW !</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift. Saw what I purchased the brushes looked cheap. A little disappointed but you get what you paid for.</li>
    <li> this set is great just get it! i loved iy and use it everyday, the brushes arre of great quality for the price</li>
    <li> The brushes are really soft. They are  7 brushes and they are really good quality. I would recommend it to other people.</li>
    <li> Very inexpensive and work very well. The brushes feel like real hair and I was surprised, considering the price I payed for them.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend!</li>
    <li> The bristles don&#x27;t shed when wet! Easy to wash. This product is exactly what I was looking for and at a great price!</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes due to the great reviews they had. After about a week one of the brushes lost its head  so I can&#x27;t use it any more.</li>
    <li> These are great, mini brushes perfect for carrying in the bag for emergency touch up purposes. Not full-sized makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality for the price. Took a long time to get and when I emailed to check on item they never responded. But no biggie since the item was delivered. They do have a strong chemical smell that may be difficult to get over if you sensitive to strong smells.</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes!! They a nice and soft and the carrying case is a great bonus!</li>
    <li> One of my great purchases for the price! I would highly recommend for everyday/non professional use! It is as good as it get!</li>
    <li> The eye shadow brushes could be better with the smaller ones. Hard to get the mid part because brush doesn&#x27;t apply evenly, works great with my other brushes.</li>
    <li> This a really nice set. The price was more than reasonable. I have paid much more for lesser quality brushes. I received them in a timely manner - less than 2 weeks from China.</li>
    <li> Great product and price. Nice case to carry all the brushes in when you travel and silver is a pretty color.</li>
    <li> Everyone&#x27;s complaining about the size and smell but are you guys really that picky? Mine has a very faint scent and they are normal size.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my daughter.  I hope she loves it</li>
    <li> Great range of brushes and the case is useful, I still use the angle brush but the rest either shed too badly or simply fell apart.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so cute and amazing for starting out. I bought these for myself to try since im starting cosmotology school and i highly reccomemd them.</li>
    <li> This was a really fast shipment. The product its self is wonderful. Just from the price alone i would recommend this to others. As for a washing the brushes i havent had any trouble out of them. The reason i gave 4 stars instead of 5 was because the packaging looked kinda cheap looking and i had to put brushes in a different holder, other than that great buy</li>
    <li> I was very unhappy when I used these brushes.  The eyeshadow brushes are short and stiff and do not apply eyeshadow smoothly.</li>
    <li> Great brushes super quality and excellent price .  Would be a great gift or treat yourself to some new makeup brushes !!!!!!</li>
    <li> Nice brushes, I will probably use them for masks and other odd projects. Nice folding wrap easily keeps them together.</li>
    <li> Got this product and once i opened it right away it smelled like spray paint. The silver case smelled so bad i just trashed wverything. Could not be safe.</li>
    <li> i put 4 stars because i like this i love the material and the brush is smooth everything is nice thank you so much amazon</li>
    <li> I wasnt expecting much for the price, put I love this set! it fits perfectly in my cosmetics bag and comes in a nice case. the brushes are not full size but are definitely not mini or cheap non-useable quality.  I would definitely recommend this set perfeect for on the go touch-ups!</li>
    <li> I got my 70s Brown Professional Cosmetic Brushes today and I have already used them.. &amp;&amp;  definitely like them</li>
    <li> Thankfully I didn&#x27;t need this urgently. It took literally 2 months to arrive. The quality is adequate but I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price. Some of the smaller brushes, except for the eyeshadow stick, are too small to be really useful.</li>
    <li> Brushes are so soft and really help pack on product</li>
    <li> Absolutely looooove these! They go with me everywhere(:</li>
    <li> Not the best quality but it works for its price</li>
    <li> Great deal! Made great Christmas presents!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase. The brushes are very soft, aren&#x27;t too small, and seem to work perfectly so far. The carrying case has that &amp;#34;new plastic&amp;#34; smell, but after a day or two of airing it out, it&#x27;s perfectly fine and holds all the brushes with a bit of extra room for my other utensils. It took about a week and a half to arrive. For only a $4 purchase, I definitely recommend these makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> The bag is very beautiful and gorgeous size of a bag I will recommend to my friends in this Thank you</li>
    <li> This brush set serves its purpose nicely. With the silver case, it works well to throw in your suitcase, or throw into a larger purse.&lt;br /&gt;I have had softer makeup brushes, but for the price, I feel they were a good investment...and they apply makeup on nicely.</li>
    <li> The brushes are really sturdy. I use them every day and am completely satisfied. Totally recommend this make up set.</li>
    <li> Love love love! By far my favorite brushes!!!</li>
    <li> The 7 Piece Professional Cosmetic Make-up Brush Set Kit is wonderful and makes my make-up look really good. I definitely would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> title says it all I wish it had more brushes its good overall though especially the one on the right</li>
    <li> five stars, i am excited that as soon as i order it, i am able to track my package down to last minute that it arrives,... Also the product cost me $1.45 cents  , the product was great quality, definately i will be ordering from here again, Thank You very much,&lt;br /&gt; Danielle S</li>
    <li> I actually really like these brushes. I bought them as a supplemental addition to my regular brushes and I have been using them pretty much every day since I got them. Very soft, minimal shedding if any... If there was another set of different brushes by the same maker, I&#x27;d buy them in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! They do not shed and have lasted a whole year without having any problems and are still great!</li>
    <li> I Think that they Work Well, I Do Enjoy the case, Nothing has fallen appart yet, And The shipping took about 4-5 Days(Fairly Quick) But the only thing i would say would be that they smelt when i got them so clean them before you use them!!! Otherwise VERY SATISFIED!!(:</li>
    <li> The brushes are small but good for travel. The spoolie is great for working through your eyebrows, and some of the smaller eye brushes are good for liner and more detailed work. The larger powder brush is rather soft, but not too useful. It could probably be used for highlighter, but not much else. The brushes didn&#x27;t have any smell when they arrived, and did not shed after multiple washes.</li>
    <li> I give this a 5 star rating because they are sooooo amazing! They are incredibly easy to work with eyeshadow and the angle brush is great for eyeliner too!</li>
    <li> Brushes were soft and the appropriate size</li>
    <li> The big brush is super soft, and I love that. The brushes are good, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because the eyebrow brush is really hard and the little sponge-thing doesn&#x27;t move much (so it&#x27;s really hard to actually use). but overall I&#x27;d say these are alright.</li>
    <li> I love them, I only use a few of the brushes though.</li>
    <li> I love and dislike this product at the same time.I love it because the eyebrow shaper,powder brush and eyelash wand they are great products and I love how they are made good.But the eyeshadow tools I don&#x27;t like at all they where very hard and the sponge applicator wouldn&#x27;t wash off well at all and it fell apart the first time I used it.But I love the little pouch that it came with.Ive used this product only 3 times at the most.</li>
    <li> Its an excellent kit, for being as cheap as it was. Loved the brushes, I would totally buy them again!</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes so far so good!</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Thanks!</li>
    <li> i love the make up brush set!! it is perfect. very easy to use and they don&#x27;t break. extremely pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> i loved these brushes i usually don&#x27;t use brushes to apply my make up but these were so easy to use</li>
    <li> Because these brushes were dirty cheap, I thought they weren&#x27;t gonna be any good. But they are, and they seem strong like they&#x27;d last for a good while.</li>
    <li> Just got mine today they have are very soft yet very sturdy. They are just what I needed to get the job done.</li>
    <li> Loved them great price fast shipping</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the Brown Professional Cosmetic Makeup Brush Set, they were very high quality and the container pouch was very handy.</li>
    <li> just like described and cheaper than in stores I use this each day applying my makeup great while using like a pro</li>
    <li> Need some brushes quickly and cheap? grab some of these. There is onlt 1 puffy kabuki style brush, but the others come in with the perfect sizes for eyes and lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the little carrying case is nice as well too, but overall its a great deal for a second/travel kit</li>
    <li> brush handles are ok but the tip of the applicators are very loose. Application of eye shadow was not good.  The shadow does not get distributed well at all.  My fingers did a better job.  I do like the case.  It is nice to have all the brushes at your fingertip.</li>
    <li> Cheap and rough. Smell bad. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> I bought the kit mainly for grooming my eyebrows as well as putting makeup on my eye area overall. I&#x27;m no makeup pro. For me I gotta try something myself instead of be influenced by others&#x27; reviews. The brushes works great for my intended use for them. I like that the kit arrived on time and it&#x27;s very compact. The brushes look and feel quality-made for the price, in my opinion. Bonus extra brushes for blush/powder/contour and the lips for me.</li>
    <li> perfect, fast shipping, exactly as described</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the price</li>
    <li> Very small not the best quality, but is good for the price. Included storage, travel pouch is great.</li>
    <li> For this price, you can&#x27;t find better! These are great :)</li>
    <li> i really love the brushes ever since i got them i haven&#x27;t stopped using them they are awesome i told my friend to buy them</li>
    <li> I love my 7piece brown brushes. Just the right amount of brushes for me.  Simple and very well made.  Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> I honestly just needed a bronzer brush, but I ended up getting this whole kit. I don&#x27;t regret it at all. The case it comes in is nice and even though I haven&#x27;t used all the brushes, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d all hold up just as nice as the ones I do use. Great for the price!</li>
    <li> Seriously I thought this may be a cheap product because of how cheap it was on here. But it&#x27;s not, it is something every woman needs!! I can&#x27;t believe it only cost me a couple bucks!! I love Amazon!! Quick delivery also, thanks!</li>
    <li> It had 7 brushes and they work fine but the picture is not of the actual brushes that are sold. The two on the left in this picture aren&#x27;t in the set at all actually. They&#x27;re replaced by two extra brushes instead.  They&#x27;re also a different color and style from the picture. Disappointed but the brushes I did get still work very well so I&#x27;m not too upset</li>
    <li> For cheap make-up brushes these things work great! I use them daily &amp; they are holding up quite well. I love that they are in a carry case &amp; not just getting tossed around in my make up bag.</li>
    <li> That title is super creepy, but it comes from a great quality product. This is a great price for the quantity and quality of this product. The brushes are super smooth and feel great on my skin. I&#x27;m not any kind of make-up guru, but I&#x27;ve put on tons of make-up while doing theatre and definitely recommend these. Make-up goes on smoothly and there&#x27;s enough variety in the brushes to conquer multiple looks.&lt;br /&gt;The case looks kinda cheap, but I like cheap make-up bags because mine go through a lot with theatre and being tossed around and such. If you like having fancy make-up carriers though, I don&#x27;t recommend this case. It works perfectly fine, so I stand behind my 5 stars, but if you&#x27;re looking for classy, look elsewhere or get this and then put the brushes in something else. It does its job, it just doesn&#x27;t look super sexy while doing it.</li>
    <li> I found out about this professional makeup set by accident.  It was promotional item and all it cost me was a small shipping fee.  Item arrived quickly (from China) and was professionally packed.  I really like the pouch that keeps brusher together.  It is small enough that can be easily be carries on a plane or on a short trip when you are trying to save space in your luggage.</li>
    <li> This is just what I was wanting!</li>
    <li> I got this in the mail today I&#x27;m not really impressed as I know the price is a good deal but elf brushes are cheap too and quality. It&#x27;s good for starters.</li>
    <li> This was used as a gift for a teen just starting to use makeup.  She loves it and it met all her needs.</li>
    <li> my mother absolutely loved these brushes, there was no smell because I opened it right when it was received and smelled it due to the complaints.  The shipping was as stated/expected for the price.</li>
    <li> Great little set of make up brushes!</li>
    <li> These are terrible quality and will be going in the trash.</li>
    <li> Got it within 2 days nice price.</li>
    <li> The set comes nicely in a silver clutch, and it is worth every cent you spent on it - which is not that much anyway.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my little sister and i was pleased with the quality of the brushes and the case that it came in.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t give me exactly what I wanted which is a little disappointing but I still got my brushes</li>
    <li> Loved all the other brushes but the biggest brush is not as big as shown. I use mineral powder so if you do the same I do not recommend the biggest brush for that. It is definitely more of a blush brush.</li>
    <li> This make-up brush set is okay. I mean it&#x27;s not the best and it&#x27;s not the worst.</li>
    <li> I like this case a lot. The guest bathroom is the only room in my house with both a mirror and good lighting so Icarry my stuff around all the time. This keeps me from losing pieces. It has all the tools I need plus a couple I don&#x27;t. The soft case is nice looking as well. I particularly like the big brush. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin as much as others.</li>
    <li> This brush set is great. The price is fantastic too. It arrived ahead of schedule as well!!!</li>
    <li> really liked these brushes but the ones I use and still have, after a year later is the fluffy powder brush which is really good for bronzer, the angled brush which is good for applying eyebrow powder and a nice flat brush that&#x27;s good for applying product around the eyebrows.</li>
    <li> The price is FABULOUS for the quality and the durability.  I would definitely buy simething from this company again.  I am bery happy!</li>
    <li> Comprei estes pinceis para minha filha. E eu adorei, para uma menina de treze anos &amp;eacute; muito bom. Nada profissional &amp;eacute; claro. Mas sabendo fazer maquiagem, pode fazer muitos looks diferentes. Os pinceis são super macios e resistentes. Não são tão pequenos, eu imaginei que seriam bem menores. O estojo &amp;eacute; uma graça. Valeu pelo produto. Eu recomendo.</li>
    <li> Really sturdy product... The stuff that came in stinks ewww</li>
    <li> The set is a good value for daily makeup brushes. For the price, you cannot complain anything. The quality looks good. Also, it was very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the brushes are nice just not as big as I thought they would be. The lash comb doesn&#x27;t work well. Don&#x27;t know if it is just me.  Not bad for a starter set considering the price.</li>
    <li> I love my new brushes!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great vert sot easy to use with different colors does not hold the residue at all. All in one perfect little portable case.</li>
    <li> These brushes works really good and comes in such a professional case. It was great with on time delivery and would recommend this for personal use</li>
    <li> They are OK for the money, but they are not the best brushes I have ever owned.  A good product, not great.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but they arrived on time and I think they will do nicely. They are new and exactly a s expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used any sort of eye makeup besides eyeliner and very basic eyeshadow. I started following /r/makeupaddiction on Reddit and I decided I wanted to try something new with my makeup. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t own any of the brushes they used to get these looks. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a bunch of money since I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to be any good at putting on eye makeup. I found these, cheap and all the starter tools. I love them. They seem strong and they have been easy to clean. I don&#x27;t think I will need anything new for a while.</li>
