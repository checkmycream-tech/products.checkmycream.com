    <li> I feel this is a cheap substitute for the actual product. When you put it on it is just like it is glue on your hair. Not at all like the actual product I have purchased from salons.</li>
    <li> The best &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; ever!!!  I have thinning very fine hair and this product works extremely well.  Would recommend it to anyone with problem hair.  It is a Great Product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carol Mcdonough</li>
    <li> I have used Aquage Working Spray for many years. I have curly hair and let my hair get wet in the shower. After the shower I spray it with Aquage and it helps to maintain the curl without frizz. If I choose to blow my hair out to straighten it, I spray the Aquage to hold the straighter look.</li>
    <li> Fabulous hold for really straight hair - love it!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Shipped and arrived as state.</li>
    <li> Best hair spray/styling product ever!  Spray it on, style your hair, and it stays in that style till you brush it out. It had been a lifesaver for me more than once.</li>
    <li> I have used this product ever since it was marketed and it has never failed me.  It is the only product that works on my type of hair.  I would recommend it to anyone that has body problems with their hair!</li>
    <li> This spray is wonderful!  It truly holds in place without your hair looking plastered down. I have used it forever.  But just can&#x27;t seem to find it locally.  Thank goodness for Amazon.  They had it in warehouse and I had it in a week, before the receive date that was promised.  A little dab will do ya, so this should last a long time.</li>
    <li> Anybody that wants to keep the shape of their hairdo throughout the day needs this product.  You can reactive it with just damp fingers combed through your hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product, firm hold, no flacking and brushes out easily. have recommended and will order again.  Quanity verses price is outstanding</li>
    <li> Love it and want to buy more!</li>
    <li> It is wonderful.  I have been using it for a few years now and can&#x27;t live without it.</li>

    <li> Great product, good shipping</li>
    <li> wife loves this hair product and it always seems to be out of stock in the beauty salons.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for styling and root lifting.  Good price for 32 oz.  Will definitely be a regular purchase for me.</li>
    <li> If you have fine limp hair and nothing works- this product is wonderful. Easy to work with, but holds super fine hair. I have tried all products out there and this one is the only one I want to use. Have started buying on line with no shipping issues what so ever.</li>
