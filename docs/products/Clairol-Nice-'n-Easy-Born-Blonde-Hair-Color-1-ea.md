      <li>My rating is 3 stars +1 for the amazing condition.</li>
      <li>one of the best hair colouring products anywhere 1 hr is usually enough to get a great look for yourself</li>
      <li>Well... After a full 90 minutes... She ended up with bleached roots and bright red/orange ends.</li>
      <li>and I still think it&#x27;s great, but it&#x27;s not quite as consistent or effortless as</li>
      <li>Also I plan to put auburn on top so this product works for me in doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
      <li>I love to change my hair a lot in the summer.  </li>
      <li>&#x3D;)</li>
      <li>I would NOT use this bleach if your hair is not already healthy.</li>
      <li>If you already have light-colored hair, then it might work better for you.  </li>
      <li>It is also kinder to your hair and smells better.</li>
      <li>ya can&#x27;t afford a Salon visit, (or get your stylist to do the unnatural stuff to your hair like many of us who want the wilder shades have found)</li>
      <li>and I have healthy hair.</li>
      <li>They were not even able to repair the damage this product did to my hair.  </li>
      <li>ya can&#x27;t afford a Salon visit, (or get your stylist to do the unnatural stuff to your hair like many of us who want the wilder shades have found)</li>
      <li>Best price and bought several!!!!!</li>
      <li>Okay, so I&#x27;m int</li>
      <li>I have used Clairol dyeing products twice in my life, and frankly, that was two times too many.  </li>
      <li>it said on the box, mostly orangy</li>
      <li>(Even henna does more on my hair than the Clairol did.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to tone it when it dries but overal an ok product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve dyed my hair many, many times by myself</li>
      <li>The combined results were perfect: my hair doesn&#x27;t feel damaged and looks pretty much like it does when I spend hours and lots of money at the salon.</li>
      <li>I love this product and LOVE that I never have roots because I can afford to touch up super often!</li>
      <li>I FINALLY gave in to dying my own hair when a friend was using this and getting great results.</li>
      <li>Receive many comments from others, when I am out and about, how fabulous my hair color is.</li>
      <li>But was easy to use.</li>
      <li>Because this is bleaching your hair it has a really strong smell.</li>
      <li>Package came in and the box inside was opened... but everything worked fine</li>
      <li>always quick and on time love the color</li>
      <li>I picked up another product called Brass Banisher (available here on Amazon)</li>
      <li>so I could lighten it to a light brown color.</li>
      <li>It gets it blonde in one application, and leaves my hair feeling great.  </li>
      <li>Fabulous.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth it :)</li>
      <li>There some shipping issues do to us being so rural, it was received, and the follow up by the company was very well handled and I am happy with the results!</li>
      <li>Then I used the golden blond dye I bought and like magic golden blond locks!</li>
      <li>what I originally thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>So I used nice and easy&#x27;s light ash blonde</li>
      <li>Ive also used it with manic panic and special effects hair colors.  </li>
      <li>and it turned bright banana yellow.</li>
      <li>Good price and not only</li>
      <li>It turned a sorta light orangey brown, but it was close to my natural color and was not black, so I was happy.  </li>
      <li>and I got to a really light golden brown, and it was super brassy</li>
      <li>so I picked up a box of Clairol Nice N&#x27;Easy Born Blonde in Maxi.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After mixing, the product was so easy to apply, since you&#x27;re using it from a bottle instead of a bowl and brush, it is easier to apply to the darker hair first, then the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I tried this a few years ago AND LOVED IT!</li>
      <li>/&gt;The best way to go about using it, if going for a blonde look, is to use this once or twice before using an ash-toned blonde.</li>
      <li>I have experienced less breakage</li>
      <li>While it&#x27;s gentle and easy to use, this stuff makes my eyes burn.</li>
      <li>gets black out very nicely with no brassy</li>
      <li>I loved this but can&#x27;t stress enough, only get this if you are very comfortable coloring your hair and have a well ventilated room.</li>
      <li>The first time with this product my hair was very very orange with light roots.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I have my sibling dye my hair in an open room and that helps, but often I need to do my hair on my own.</li>
      <li>i noticed that my hair absorbed the product, so @</li>
      <li>Honestly though this product does what it says, It took a lot of my hair to this blonde color</li>
      <li>I went to beauty supply and got a nice soy based product that lifted my hair to a strawberry blonde.  </li>
      <li>I am a natural blonde and this is great for covering gray.</li>
      <li>Normally I just have the exhaust fan on in my bathroom but with the strong ammonia smell</li>
      <li>It lightened my regrowth to a very light blonde and took a good deal of pink out of my hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I have used this product maybe two or three times in the past and it always worked great.</li>
      <li>does it lighten dark hair, it leaves the hair in good condition.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super gentle and lightens a LOT - even on my boyfriends stubborn wolf hair -</li>
      <li>Best true blonde hair color for my natural dark hair color.</li>
      <li>USE A COLOR REMOVER FIRST.</li>
      <li>okay with having yellow/white/orange hair until your next hair dye session,&lt;br /&gt;or b)</li>
      <li>their advertisements of coverage for grays (the strongest and most resistant hair when coloring) when they can&#x27;t even affect teenage, virgin hair.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t love is that it took forever since parts of my hair want to stay orange and the process plus toner took forever at the salon.</li>
      <li>/&gt;To move the process over a little better, I did wrap my hair up in a plastic store bag, which made it easy to check on, as well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>There is really no way to control the consistency of lifting that many shades so quickly.</li>
      <li>It pisses me off that the only good stuff out there that actually WORKS is from companies who do this, (hence my reticence to use Feria again).  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love to change my hair a lot in the summer.  normally I am a level 5 mousey brown.  sometimes I will dye my hair a beet red, or copper. I had dyed my hair beet red and really wanted blonde.  I went to beauty supply and got a nice soy based product that lifted my hair to a strawberry blonde.  After a week or so, I really did not like that color so decided to use born blonde maxi.    This time, of course I had already lifted my hair up to at least level 8, but here&#x27;s the trick.  be careful with that powder and make sure it is thoroughly mixed.  no lumps! then with the smelly liquid, after it is all mixed, use it right away.  put a plastic cap on to help the heat of your head to make it work.  some people need to keep the product on for longer, maybe 2 hours tops.    so, it&#x27;s really just a careful thing to do.  If it&#x27;s too hard to do it right by yourself, get a friend or partner to help make sure that it is evenly distributed. Again, this is a great product. use a toner too!</li>
    <li> My wife has used this product for years to touch up her black roots (don&#x27;t tell her I told you;) and loves it.</li>
    <li> always quick and on time love the color</li>
    <li> I have dark dark brown hair  Currently I use it on my roots and my hair comes out pale yellow/blonde. But bleach is not suppose to be the only lightener. It&#x27;s suppose to be followed by a toner. So I do not expect this to bring me to white. It is not damaging! My hair actually feels healthier after using this!!!!  Previously I&#x27;ve used it on dyed jet black hair and it came out orange ish yellow. But I expected that being it wasn&#x27;t being used on natural virgin hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not terrible, but not the best. Here&#x27;s what I did.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was a dyed dark red brown a few months ago and it&#x27;s was bleached and died times before that. But it&#x27;s faded a little since I originally dyed it that dark red brown and last week or almost two weeks ago I used color oops and I got to a really light golden brown, and it was super brassy but bearable.&lt;br /&gt;So I got this product because I thought it would be less damaging than Sally&#x27;s bleach and developer that I usually do.&lt;br /&gt;And it was less damaging but not by much. And i know bleach is going to damag hair no matter what so I&#x27;m saying I&#x27;m expecting 0 damage, but I was hoping for less damage.&lt;br /&gt;But if after you bleach your hair, you put in loreal total repair damage erasing balm for two hours it does help a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I left the bleach in my hair for about 60 minutes ( keep checking up on it throughout) and it did lighten it a lot. Not platinum, no where near platinum except my roots. The rest was different ranges of yellow and some orange ( not the dyes fault on the uneven color, that was my fault)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to tone it when it dries but overal an ok product.</li>
    <li> Honestly I&#x27;ve never used this product before, but I bought it for the same reasons everyone else did. I had dyed my hair with Revlon black about a month and a half before. Honestly though this product does what it says, It took a lot of my hair to this blonde color it said on the box, mostly orangy like everyone says, HOWEVER, I understand that I had black hair color on my hair previously so I understand this would skew my results! Other than that it seems to be working fine, I haven&#x27;t washed it off yet and it&#x27;s been 60 minutes. Also I plan to put auburn on top so this product works for me in doing it&#x27;s job. I believe if I didn&#x27;t have dye that it would ABSOLUTELY go to the color on the box. Also I have really long hair so I probably needed two boxes as the girl on the box has short hair!&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again, I know my results are exponentially decayed because of my long hair and prior dying. &#x3D;) In other words, if I didn&#x27;t have permanent black hair dye previously on my hair, I know my hair would be blonde. It ended up being a yellowy blonde, which worked for me!</li>
    <li> This is possibly the WORST blonde product ever!  I followed the directions on the box to a T, and only get a head full of ORANGE, messy, DRY hair!  I was a dark blonde to begin with so wth?!!    Do NOT buy this junk!    I&#x27;ll stick with Feria from now on!  It&#x27;s the only brand that works!</li>
    <li> Great product. I use this product whenever I can afford to. The box was damaged when I received it though/</li>
    <li> I am hiding in my room.  And this is after spending 5 1/2 hours and $300 at the salon today.  They were not even able to repair the damage this product did to my hair.  I followed the directions to the t!  I am a competent, intelligent person.  Do not purchase! If you purchased it, return it or throw it away, but for God&#x27;s sake do not put it on your hair.  It turned my hair brassy orange and platinum.  I think I was actually glowing in the dark last night.  I thought I could save some money by using this product, but trust me it has done nothing but waste money and cause heartache.  The box says \\&quot;blonde without brassy tones\\&quot; what a JOKE!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used Clairol dyeing products twice in my life, and frankly, that was two times too many.  The stuff NEVER does what it says it should, and always seems to be a (chemically) half-arsed attempt.  I have dark brown hair, and the ONLY reason why I bought their BB Maxi brand (instead of the Feria Blonding that I usually use, and trust due to -great- results), is because they purported that their formula would take even the darkest hair and make it very fair, natural-looking blond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I tried it, did exactly what they told me to do on the package, and what I got out of it was a big, scary as hell, holy MESS.  I&#x27;ve dyed my hair many, many times by myself w/no problems, and this stuff came out spotty, uneven like crazy, and brought my hair from a pretty, dark reddish and black to an uneven, blotchy wasteland of varying oranges, light-brownish puddles, and pale-yellowy wisps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact of the matter is (at least in my experience), Clairol just doesn&#x27;t work w/the kick and power it purports to.  It was just like the last time I tried a Clairol product, and like last time, I deeply regretted having touched hair that I was kind of pleased with, to make it the hideous mass it had become.  Last time I used Clairol, I&#x27;d bought a strong, (what I thought to be) true red to use on virgin, un-dyed brown hair.  Although their box bespoke a promise to make my hair a fiery red, all I got was the effect of a mild, barely visible color wash.  (Even henna does more on my hair than the Clairol did.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I don&#x27;t see how these people stay in busines w/their advertisements of coverage for grays (the strongest and most resistant hair when coloring) when they can&#x27;t even affect teenage, virgin hair.  Their stuff just doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, get Clairol products if you like HINTS of color, washes, and gentle highlights or more natural, subtle looks.  (Think SHEER.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If however, you&#x27;re lookin&#x27; for a dramatic change or a power-packed burst of vibrant, drastically different hues that really pop (from your current shade), DO NOT BUY CLAIROL.  Trust me.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  &#x27;Cause you&#x27;ll end up having to spend money you couldn&#x27;t afford to lose (for me it was $170+) at the salon like I did, to FIX Clairol&#x27;s mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get Feria, or Garnier Nutrisse instead.&lt;br /&gt;-Be warned though;  For those sensitive to animal-testing, L&#x27;Oreal (who makes Feria and other products) DOES TEST ON ANIMALS.&lt;br /&gt;It pisses me off that the only good stuff out there that actually WORKS is from companies who do this, (hence my reticence to use Feria again).  But if it&#x27;s the only thing that works and ya can&#x27;t afford a Salon visit, (or get your stylist to do the unnatural stuff to your hair like many of us who want the wilder shades have found), it&#x27;s sort of the only way to go.&lt;br /&gt;(As far as I know, that is.)ifferent hues that really pop (from your current shade), DO NOT BUY CLAIROL.

    <li> I have medium dark hair and needed to bleach it so I could lighten it to a light brown color. Long story short it lightened my hair very well.</li>
    <li> I seriously recommend NOT using this to go from a dark brown to an instant blonde. There is really no way to control the consistency of lifting that many shades so quickly. I went from a darker ash brown to a shade of orange/white/another strange orange. I will embarrass myself with pics to show everyone that this is not the way to go.</li>
    <li> The results from this product were excellent. A foolproof way to go super-light blonde at home. So easy, and the resulting color was beautiful. This product is a keeper, and I&#x27;ll be using it from now on. Why go to a salon and pay more, when you can just bleach at home and get that perfect platinum-blonde look?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only caveat:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you have thick hair, then just one box of this stuff is nowhere near enough product.  I have short but extremely thick hair, and one bottle was barely enough to do my roots. In fact, I can&#x27;t imagine that just one box would be sufficient for anybody, unless you&#x27;re nearly bald and have only a small amount of thin, fine hair. Get two boxes if you want an all-over application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: like any bleach, this is harsh stuff. It will burn your head and leave blisters on your scalp if you leave it on too long. Be careful, follow the directions, and consider leaving it on for less time than the box says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have used this product maybe two or three times in the past and it always worked great. This time, it took THREE bottles to get my hair to the desired white-blonde shade instead of neon yellow and it seemed to work much slower than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My hair is very short but also VERY thick, and my natural color is sort of a dark \\&quot;dirty blonde\\&quot; or ash-blonde. I&#x27;m taking off a star because there seems to be a case of \\&quot;diminishing returns\\&quot; with this product. I&#x27;ll continue to use it and I still think it&#x27;s great, but it&#x27;s not quite as consistent or effortless as what I originally thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, there WILL be an intensely painful burning sensation and there&#x27;s not much you can do about it. Rub some vaseline along your hairline and the back of your neck to protect your skin. That helps.</li>
    <li> Takes my chestnut colored hair to a pretty honey blonde in about 10 minutes with no toner needed. I don&#x27;t notice anymore damage than when I&#x27;ve had it done professionally and I get compliments all of the time. No one ever believes me when I say I do it myself. Read the directions thoroughly and do some research on application techniques before giving it go. Be brave! It&#x27;s worth it :)</li>
    <li> Fabulous. Works great. I nought it on here with my prime cause it was cheaper than going down to walmart. I swear that this smells worse.though.</li>
    <li> I USED BORN BLONDE MAXI.  ON MY COPPER HAIR, IN MARCH. IT WORKED GREAT..  IF YOU USE THIS LIGHTENER ON DARK HAIR, IT WILL TURN ORANGE.  USE A COLOR REMOVER FIRST. IF YOU DYE YOUR HAIR.</li>
    <li> I wanted to turn my dark hair white on my bangs.  I&#x27;ve used lift powders and this to lighten but it never did turn white.  For brunettes wanting to go blonde, you&#x27;ll need to lighten a few times and don&#x27;t be surprised if it turns orange/red on you first.  You&#x27;ll need to add toners to calm down the reds.  In hindsight, I should&#x27;ve just gone to the hairdresser and have them bleach it white.  If you already have light-colored hair, then it might work better for you.  It&#x27;s not true that you can become blonde when your natural hair is brown/black.  I did my bangs 7X in one month and it still didn&#x27;t get white or platinum blonde on me.</li>
    <li> I did ombré hair with this and had gotten literally so many compliments, it is awesome. The price is so great, and literally it bleaches well.</li>
    <li> Best true blonde hair color for my natural dark hair color. Never goes brassy. Receive many comments from others, when I am out and about, how fabulous my hair color is.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this for several years, but I decided to go blonde again, and it is still the amazing product it&#x27;s always been.</li>
    <li> Turned my hair orange.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying one thing: Those of you moaning and groaning about getting orange hair and crap obviously haven&#x27;t tried lightening hair before. Anyone who has experience in making major changes to hair would know that the brass and copper tones in artificial dark hair such as black and auburn will ALWAYS cause your hair to be an orange color the first time you bleach it. It happens. To. Everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way to go about using it, if going for a blonde look, is to use this once or twice before using an ash-toned blonde. You aren&#x27;t supposed to be using this to actually go blonde, this is more for making the big super changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for YEARS now and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it other than the fumes. It&#x27;s super gentle and lightens a LOT - even on my boyfriends stubborn wolf hair - so it&#x27;s my go to for every hair color change I decide to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fumes are why I took a star away. While it&#x27;s gentle and easy to use, this stuff makes my eyes burn. I usually have to turn on the fan and open the bathroom windows or else my eyes tear up and feel like they&#x27;re igniting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, though, this stuff is the bomb. I&#x27;ve used it to go from black to white, blue to red, purple to blonde, and so on.</li>
    <li> Nothing works quite as well as a bleach to eventually get the&lt;br /&gt;color that you are looking for.  You will not want to try anything&lt;br /&gt;else once you tried this one</li>
    <li> This was a product that I always used but could not find this color for the past 1-1/2 years. I am a natural blonde and this is great for covering gray. The product showed up way before it said it would. I would purchase again from this seller.</li>
    <li> My hair was orange. Left on for over an hour. Wasn&#x27;t at all what I was hoping for. But was easy to use.</li>
    <li> This will lighten your hair. But you should know what you&#x27;re doing. This is not for someone who has never dyed hair before. This is a serious lightener but if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing your hair may look like a patchwork colored dye job. Because this is bleaching your hair it has a really strong smell. Normally I just have the exhaust fan on in my bathroom but with the strong ammonia smell I had to set up a box fan to pull the fumes out of the room. I loved this but can&#x27;t stress enough, only get this if you are very comfortable coloring your hair and have a well ventilated room.</li>
    <li> If you want to go lighter, whatever the shade you&#x27;d like. I recommend this product. Leave it on for however long you decide depending on your strand test.&lt;br /&gt;I started with blond &amp; wanted to make it an even lighter blonde.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, it went from blonde to white/yellow.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE unless you&#x27;re a) okay with having yellow/white/orange hair until your next hair dye session,&lt;br /&gt;or b) have a toner/hair dye that you&#x27;re ready to use.</li>
    <li> I dye my hair crazy colors a lot.  (like every 3 weeks)&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I get tired of upkeep so I just dye it black.&lt;br /&gt;This gets black out very nicely with no brassy tones.&lt;br /&gt;VERY strong and makes your eyes water really bad if you don&#x27;t have a fan.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the best bleach I have ever used for black hair, and I highly recommend it! (:</li>
    <li> So I buy this at Wal-Mart because it&#x27;s a lot cheaper there but I&#x27;ve had really good results from it. My hair started pink and I tried a color remover that didn&#x27;t do much. So I bought this product. I had maybe 3 inches of regrowth that was dark brown. It lightened my regrowth to a very light blonde and took a good deal of pink out of my hair. I followed it up with wella lightest ash blonde toner and it worked like a charm.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I&#x27;m int he process of removing YEARS of black colour from my hair. I used a Color Fix and various bleach products from beauty supply shops that either didn&#x27;t work, or only bleached my fresh roots.&lt;br /&gt;So, I bought a box of this from a local store to try, and following the instructions, IT WORKED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my hair was pretty dry after the fact, which is NORMAL, because this is BLEACH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After mixing, the product was so easy to apply, since you&#x27;re using it from a bottle instead of a bowl and brush, it is easier to apply to the darker hair first, then the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To move the process over a little better, I did wrap my hair up in a plastic store bag, which made it easy to check on, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is like HEAVEN. Really helps moisturize the hair after bleaching. I did pick up a keratin protein hair kit (for 10 bucks at same local store) so, my hair will have a little TLC for the first week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for less than 9 bucks, I would MUCH rather use this, with better results. than spend 200+ at the salon (which I have done before, paying someone else to DESTROY my hair was pretty traumatic)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember: depending on the health, colour, and type of hair, results do vary. Just do a strand test before diving in!</li>
    <li> one of the best hair colouring products anywhere 1 hr is usually enough to get a great look for yourself</li>
    <li> This product totally transformed my brown hair into complete blond and it lasts long without inflicting too much damage on my hair. Dont get it on your clothes tho, i dumped two pairs of jeans due to the stains</li>
    <li> I use this stuff with punky color from jerome russel.  Ive also used it with manic panic and special effects hair colors.  I have used other bleaches, including the ones recommended by the previously named hair colors, but this is by far the best.  My hair is super dark brown, not black.  It gets it blonde in one application, and leaves my hair feeling great.  One time I forgot how long I had it in and I freaked out because I thought my hair would crackle and snap off, but it didnt at all.  I will only use this bleach, ever.</li>
    <li> Love this! I have really long DARK hair that I have dyed plenty of times. This bleach lifted the color to a yellow gold. I used a garnier toner but that didn&#x27;t get rid of the gold like I wanted to. So I used nice and easy&#x27;s light ash blonde and I love it!</li>
    <li> My natural color is a light brown/dark blonde with red highlights. A year ago I decided to go almost platinum and loved it. The only thing I didn&#x27;t love is that it took forever since parts of my hair want to stay orange and the process plus toner took forever at the salon. Recently my roots had gotten too long and my life too hectic to schedule an appointment so I picked up a box of Clairol Nice N&#x27;Easy Born Blonde in Maxi. I mean, it was just my roots so surely if I messed up it wouldn&#x27;t be that noticeable, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I wasn&#x27;t completely wrong. I left it on for 2 hours and the roots matched the rest...in places...but those spots the stylist had trouble with turned baby chick yellow. It wasn&#x27;t bad enough that I felt the need to hide my face in public, but it didn&#x27;t look good. I picked up another product called Brass Banisher (available here on Amazon) The combined results were perfect: my hair doesn&#x27;t feel damaged and looks pretty much like it does when I spend hours and lots of money at the salon. The two products combined cost much less than I tip my stylist. Best of all, I can do it all when I have time at home instead of having to schedule an appointment.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this purchase. I purchased it for my teenage daughter&#x27;s hair which was a light brown in the beginning. It worked very well in turning her hair into a natural blonde look.</li>
    <li> Even on my overly dye-saturated black hair, this still brought me up to an orange color.  It really wasn&#x27;t all that damaging either.  Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Best price and bought several!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been spending $100 a month on my hair for as long as I can remember (minimum 9 years). I have naturally dark brown (half hispanic) hair that turns red with ANY dye... even ash, bleaching is my only option if I want to be blonde. My salon was using wella light , switched to blondor and then switched to redken blonde icing (to give you an idea of the products this is comparable to. I FINALLY gave in to dying my own hair when a friend was using this and getting great results. I leave this on WAY longer than they suggest (as I had in the salon using salon grade products also)  and sometimes I even apply a bit of heat to help process. I have experienced less breakage and I don&#x27;t even need a toner to match my extensions (lightest blonde) I love this product and LOVE that I never have roots because I can afford to touch up super often!</li>
    <li> i used two boxes on my hair last night.  i had to dye the Xtra growth from neglecting to bleach it and buying a product i had used before, yet had concerns about(when you are younger, you change your colour like your mood- you cant when you get older).  i noticed that my hair absorbed the product, so @ the last min., i re-applied- it didn&#x27;t work out, i have Blotches of Dark, but Mostly a Brassy Blonde Colour, i want to get a semi-perm dye to tone it down, idk?</li>
    <li> I tried this a few years ago AND LOVED IT! I think it helped that I had not dyed my hair in a while and that my mom helped me do it but it turns out different for every one once I dyed this color I used deep conditioning hair products for the first week and a half to really help it. I would have kept using them but my hair is thick but very fine however that works. I loved my color if was to use it agian I would try and  find out how to get it a certen color but I loved how it turned out by its self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does feel a bit harsh at first but I&#x27;m come on your stripping the color out of your hair. Its not that bad people!</li>
    <li> It will ruin your hair and burns your scalp!! I had clumps of hair come out and I have healthy hair. It turns it really crazy platinum though!</li>
    <li> I used this bleach twice with very different results. The first time I used it, I had dyed blue black hair. This is the only bleach that has ever gotten blue black out of my hair. It turned a sorta light orangey brown, but it was close to my natural color and was not black, so I was happy.  The second time I used it, my hair was its natural color. I left it on for an hour and a half...and it turned bright banana yellow. So I applied it a second time for another hour, and it turned dull banana yellow.    I&#x27;d like to know what bleach the model on the box used, because I&#x27;d buy that next.    If your hair isn&#x27;t dyed black and you want omg blonde like the box, go to Sally&#x27;s and buy Kaledicolors or any of the quick blues, a toner, and an ash blonde. I&#x27;d skip this.</li>
    <li> Works great, and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair.</li>
    <li> My friend and I used this to attempt to blonde her medium auburn hair. We figured this product should do it easily since it says it lighens up to BLACK hair.  We followed the directions to the tee and waited.  Well... After a full 90 minutes... She ended up with bleached roots and bright red/orange ends. Dyed completely unevenly and she was freaking out. We are dying it red now and hoping it covers the platinum roots.  Absolutely ridiculous.  \\&quot;Nice &#x27;n Easy\\&quot; is possibly the worst possible name for this product.</li>
    <li> There some shipping issues do to us being so rural, it was received, and the follow up by the company was very well handled and I am happy with the results!</li>
    <li> I would not recommend buying this product. Was left with yellow/orange hair. My natural hair color was dark blonde. Used a toner after using this product and it did not change. Went to a professional salon for color correction as well after using this product, hair color stayed a crayon yellow with hints of orange! I have to wait a month b4 I do anything else with it. In the meantime I&#x27;m walking around with this horrible result! Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Good product. I have salt-pepper hair now and wanted to go platinum. I used this once to lighten, then used Feria Ultimate Platinum a few days later and achieved the color I wanted, Plus my hair is real silky! Happy!</li>
    <li> I have darker blonde hair and other hair dye brands all turn my hair rust/bronze. This is the only hair dye that gives me platinum blonde. I love it!!! Try it if you haven&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> This Clairol product makes me look like a natural blonde. The conditioner it comes with leaves my hair feeling silky. I love it!</li>
    <li> I had dark brown hair and have been using a different product to get it blonde and keep it that way. I saw this product, read the package information and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Because this kit included the bleach packet, I thought it would make my light blonde hair lighter. Wrong. I am currently sporting a head of light auburn and light blonde hair. I didn&#x27;t get this product because I wanted to use a toner - I wanted a full head of blonde hair, which this product said I would get. I&#x27;m going to stick to Garnier, which worked like it said it would. It is also kinder to your hair and smells better.</li>
    <li> Package came in and the box inside was opened... but everything worked fine and I got the blonde I wanted with my purple hair shampoo helping. Thank you for having this wonderful hair dye!</li>
    <li> I dyed my hair dark brown for the longest time and I loved it but this summer I decided I wanted to go blond which I hadn&#x27;t been in years. I spent lots of money buying blond hair dye which to my horror didn&#x27;t lighten my hair at all. I even tried color oops and still dark brown hair I thought I was going to be stuck with it forever. Then I ran across this I bought two boxes since I have long hair and two boxes of golden blond to go on after. I used the born blond first of course my hair was an ugly strawberry/orange color with platinum roots. Then I used the golden blond dye I bought and like magic golden blond locks! I&#x27;m in heaven!</li>
    <li> Mega hair fryer and lots of scalp burns/scabs!!! My hair was so damaged after using this product, that I had to stop using it. I use Naturatint now and it does not fry my hair. My hair is growing again after 5 years of using this product. I will never use this product again!!!</li>
    <li> This is the only box dye that really turns my hair from medium/dark brown to a light blonde. I have tried so many different box dyes, and I can only rely on this one for the proper result. Unfortunately, it stinks horribly bad and makes my bathroom smell like a chemical factory. I can feel how that stink feels in my lungs and it&#x27;s just awful. Sometimes I have my sibling dye my hair in an open room and that helps, but often I need to do my hair on my own. I will continue to use this product, but I wish Clairol would work on making it less of a stink. I can&#x27;t imagine this stuff is good for my health.</li>
    <li> This definitely did not take my hair to the blonde on the box. If you really believe that a $10 box of lightener is going to get you from dark, repeatedly dyed, brown (muah) to platinum blonde then you should probably go to the salon and save yourself the heart attack of looking the mirror after. The first time with this product my hair was very very orange with light roots. Didn&#x27;t freak out, I just went out and bought the Born Blonde blue version and did another treatment. Now, my hair is banana yellow. Still not what I want, but I will be trying a Wella toner this weekend and we will see how that goes. My rating is 3 stars +1 for the amazing condition. Seriously, I need a MUCH bigger bottle. Felt wonderful. I would NOT use this bleach if your hair is not already healthy.</li>
    <li> My replacement for the now long defunt Summer Blonde, which was a much gentler formula. I am now 37 and starting to get lots of white grey hairs, and my hair has always come up very fast. I use only about 1/2 of just one of the blue powder ligtheners, and leav eon for only 10 min, max. I get great results but that it because my hair is trule dark blonde, so I do not get oranges, but just lots of natural looking streaks and colors.</li>
    <li> Good price and not only does it lighten dark hair, it leaves the hair in good condition.</li>
