      <li>Having days - DAYS - of stubble free legs is wonderful!</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s something I can do on my own time, unlike waxing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This would be a 5-star product if I liked it better for bikini line cleanup, but as it is, it is a good, well-made 4-star epilator.</li>
      <li>This multi use epilator is the front runner of its kind.  </li>
      <li>shower gel did leave my skin feeling nice and</li>

      <li>Altogether, a nice, well-thought out device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But I can honestly say that among the 5/6 brands of epilators I&#x27;ve used in my life, this is by far the best one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has two speeds you can choose from.&lt;br /&gt; - The light is bright and useful.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think for someone with a higher pain threshold than my wife would get great use from this product</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s water proof, works fantastic with body wash, and does an excellent job of epilating.&lt;br /&gt; - Strong tweezing blades work great even when wet and foaming with body wash.&lt;br</li>
      <li>, that&#x27;s the piece she likes the most of the set.</li>
      <li>Now that I&#x27;ve more closely read the book, I will give it another try (</li>
      <li>has used it, and more than the epilator</li>
      <li>and they are not all big fat liars like my best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Sure, it hurts for a millisecond</li>
      <li>Make sure you know the difference between shaving and epilating.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sold on using the Panasonic 4n1 Epilator for achieving hair-free legs and gladly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And, I love the convenience of it.</li>
      <li>It provides valuable information to get the most out of your epilating</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t get any better.  </li>
      <li>I worked both my lower legs on one charge with plenty more charge to go.&lt;br /&gt; -</li>
      <li>and I will probably use that more than the hair</li>
      <li>And definitely more slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it more than once.</li>
      <li>Really pleased.</li>
      <li>OK, I&#x27;m not going to lie and say it feels like you&#x27;re being playfully licked by puppies...</li>
      <li>Well, I figured SURELY time and technology has found a way to improve the experience,</li>
      <li>I hadn&#x27;t been able to get up the nerve to use an epilator again since the Epilady... in the 1980s.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
      <li>Battery life better than what she is used too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Being able to use it in the shower with your favorite body wash makes a huge difference.  </li>
      <li>When we got belly rings, my best friend went first because she liked to say that I was the big baby.  </li>
      <li>Being able to use in in the shower is a huge plus to making epilating more comfortable experience.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Being able to see what I was doing made a huge difference.  </li>
      <li>&gt; - While Panasonic does what it can to make epilating more comfortable, it does NOT eliminate the pain and discomfort you may encounter.</li>
      <li>There is also a &amp;#34;sonic exfoliation head&amp;#34; that is basically the most fantastic thing EVER.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This would be a 5-star product if I liked it better for bikini line cleanup, but as it is, it is a good, well-made 4-star epilator.oved hair is fairly light in color, fine, and relatively sparse.  </li>
      <li>/&gt; - Easy to understand instructions.</li>
      <li>The heads snap in and out easily, and are easily cleaned.  </li>
      <li>Easy to switch between them.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a fine product my wife tells me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean, and the light makes it easy to see what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
      <li>This thing HURTS (on both the speeds available).</li>
      <li>It also has LED light to make it easier to see what you are working on.</li>
      <li>The flexible heads work smoothly with the curves of the body.&lt;br /&gt; -</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s possible that I&#x27;m a wimp, and if so this is probably a great method of hair removal for women of a tougher constitution.</li>
      <li>The day this device of torture arrived I was quite excited to test it out.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, SO, SO worth it!</li>
      <li>I could tell that it was removing hair, hence the stinging, but the area was not as clean as shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>bleeding and with hairless legs and pits, I got brave again and tried the wet use for the bikini line.</li>
      <li>Getting the hair yanked out by the roots doesn&#x27;t sound fun.  </li>
      <li>It charges quite quickly.  </li>
      <li>This was my very first experience with an epilator.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty much unbearable to most</li>
      <li>So yes, my first reaction was OUCH!</li>
      <li>It was more sensitive around the knee area, but not undoable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve yet to try it on the more sensitive areas like bikini or armpits</li>
      <li>This product offers many different options with it which is nice.</li>
      <li>nearly fall in love with the Panasonic 4n1 epilator.  </li>
      <li>Right now I&#x27;m going with the shaving.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Make sure you know the difference between shaving and epilating. Epilation means removal of body hair, but the product manual on page 14 says \\&quot;The hair removal is not permanent, so from the 2nd use we recommend...\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it painful? I think it is close to the sensation of getting bitten by small ants. The manual recommends:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Trim your hair before epilating for the first time or if you have not epilated for a long time. Hair removal is easier and less painful when the hair is short\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed that this product cannot be used to epilate on knee area (manual says \\&quot;prone of sagging\\&quot;). So what should I do with my hairy knees?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like this product. But I think the results may vary from person to person.</li>
    <li> If anyone ever tells you that using an epilator doesn&#x27;t hurt, they are lying.  These things basically tweeze your hair en masse causing all the pain one might expect if you took a pair of tweezers and started ripping out the hairs in your armpits, your bikini line, and on your legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was actually my first real experience with an epilator.  I&#x27;m writing this review having only been brave enough to try this once so far.  And, of course, when I decided to try it, it was all-in.  I used the standard head, dry, and decided to try it first on my bikini area.  I figured I&#x27;d do one side, then shave the other side and compare.  It was not a pleasant experience, painful as it ripped the hairs out.  Although i was not screaming in pain, and I tried to make it through by doing the entire area.  I switched the modes from hard to soft and even tried the various heads, but it all felt about the same.  The hair didn&#x27;t come off as completely as I had expected, either.  There was still some left after I had covered the entire area with the thing. There were small red blotches from the ripping out of the hairs and my skin was tender to the touch.  Figured I should have tried this wet first, but I was too lazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was at least a week ago and I still have not gotten up the nerve to go near the device again.  however, pain aside, I have noticed that the hair removed by the epilator along my right-side bikini line has not grown back as quickly as the hair on the other side that I shaved on the same day as the epilating.  So for that, it is great.  Basically for me it comes down to whether or not I want suffer through the pain and discomfort of using the epilator in order to not have to worry about shaving/epilating as often, or just keep shaving.  Right now I&#x27;m going with the shaving.  I&#x27;m too much of a wimp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;perhaps I&#x27;ll get brave and try it again in the shower, where it is supposed to be a little less painful.  If that ever happens, I&#x27;ll report back..</li>
    <li> The day this device of torture arrived I was quite excited to test it out.  I have a pretty high pain tolerance and thought that while it wouldn&#x27;t be fun, it wouldn&#x27;t be SO bad and those mentioning pain were just weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s winter.  So, shaving isn&#x27;t the every day occurrence like it is in the summer so the hair was a bit longer than the normal day-after-stubble.  I also have very thick hair so keep that in mind.  I set the Epilator on the low setting, put on the gentle guard, pulled the skin tight and gave it a whirl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOLY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CRAP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tears instantly spring to my eyes and I stop, staring at my leg and wondering what I did wrong.  Because I HAD to be doing something wrong for there to be all of these 5 star reviews.  I take a steadying breath, pull the skin tighter and go for it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOPE NOPE NOPE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I&#x27;m a dedicated reviewer if nothing else, I tried it again in the bath that night before shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hell-to-the-no.  It didn&#x27;t get any better.  Maybe worse.  And definitely more slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I thought, well heck, maybe it was because I had longer hair than normal and maybe it&#x27;s meant to be used on stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well... it was an improvement.  A marginal one, but not quite as painful.  So I continued on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOPE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know about you, but when I shave my legs, everything grows back at different times and lengths.  Some patches I miss.  So when I hit one of those said missed patches?  Yeah, nope nope nope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no way that I would turn to this thing, nor recommend anyone turn to this device, for an alternative to shaving.  If you can&#x27;t use a razor there are about a million different things I&#x27;d tell you to try before this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry Panasonic.  I had really high hopes.</li>
    <li> While I am not known for any extraordinary bravery, I took a \\&quot;no guts, no glory\\&quot; attitude when I first used this epilator:  dry, full speed, regular cap.  And I was very, very pleased with the results.  Hair-free legs!  It worked really well, and did not hurt, left just a mild tingly sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little concerned when I first read all the warnings.  Among other things, don&#x27;t use on suntanned skin (??) or baggy skin.  Hey, I&#x27;m old -- ALL my skin is baggy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use it on the unapproved knees, making sure the skin was tight, not loose, and had no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me an extra day to get the courage to try the underarm and bikini areas.  I&#x27;ve nicked myself under the arms before, and that hurts!  Getting the hair yanked out by the roots doesn&#x27;t sound fun.  So I went with the gentle head, and lower setting, and used it wet and with shower gel as directed.  No problem, so I used the regular setting, still no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No bleeding and with hairless legs and pits, I got brave again and tried the wet use for the bikini line. Bikini link only, not anything more extreme -- that would ouch, I&#x27;d think.  Anyway, I was somewhat less pleased with neatening the bikini line.  There wasn&#x27;t quite the demarcation line I&#x27;d wanted, and there were a few stragglers that the epilator didn&#x27;t take care of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the exfoliator brush wet, with shower gel, and it was a nice, spa-like, pampered feel, not too rough or too gentle.  Not to be used on the face, per instructions, and it does seem like it would be too rough for that sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The machine has a nice heavy feel to it, doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.  It charges quite quickly.  The instructions say it takes an hour, but I think mine takes less that that for a full charge.  The heads snap in and out easily, and are easily cleaned.  There is even a little carrying pouch to put it all in, and a cleaning brush.  Altogether, a nice, well-thought out device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My to-be-removed hair is fairly light in color, fine, and relatively sparse.  Whether it would work as well on other types of hair, I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be a 5-star product if I liked it better for bikini line cleanup, but as it is, it is a good, well-made 4-star epilator.oved hair is fairly light in color, fine, and relatively sparse.

    <li> I tried this dry right away for about 30 seconds, that&#x27;s all I could really take. It was really painful (as expected) and reminded me of getting a tattoo. You might think that would be an automatic negative review but it&#x27;s not a shaver, it&#x27;s essentially a hair puller. I knew what I was getting into, and I got what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then tried to use this in the shower, hoping the hot water would distract me and open my skin up to the pulling sensation. It didn&#x27;t feel as bad as it did when my skin was dry, and after a few passes did pull out the hairs I hoped it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the legs, this isn&#x27;t a huge problem in most areas, you can generally put up with the pain as it isn&#x27;t as stabbing. Around the armpits, pubic region etc it&#x27;s pretty much unbearable to most I imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife refused to use it for even a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary, getting your hair yanked hurts, this device yanks your hair, so there is no surprise. This deserves a 4/5 star rating due to it pulling the hairs efficiently after a few passes. Definitely room to improve regardless.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t been able to get up the nerve to use an epilator again since the Epilady... in the 1980s. No lie. That thing was so painful that I never wanted to experience it again.    Well, I figured SURELY time and technology has found a way to improve the experience, right? So I gave this a go. OK, I&#x27;m not going to lie and say it feels like you&#x27;re being playfully licked by puppies... but it&#x27;s nothing like it used to be. It&#x27;s no more painful than tweezing. It&#x27;s completely bearable with minimal discomfort, even when using it dry. And my legs have stayed smoother much longer than they ever have with shaving.    It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean, and the light makes it easy to see what you&#x27;re doing. Really pleased. UPDATE: It&#x27;s been nearly three weeks since I last used this on my legs, and they are still showing no signs of stubble. And I normally show stubble within 8 hours of shaving. When I was stubble-free for a few days after using this, I thought that was worth 5 stars. But WEEKS? Just... wow.</li>
    <li> I never ever EVER thought I&#x27;d see the day I would like an epilator. EVER. Epilating for me is painful and unpleasant, even with the small Emjoy device I use for my face. When I tried to see if I could bear using the Emjoy on my legs, NOPE. Hurt too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What possessed me to try Panasonic&#x27;s 4-n-1 epilating device? Sheer curiosity and, admittedly, a small part of sadism. Can Panasonic make an epilator that can make a difference? Will epilating hurt to where I can gleefully brag about what an awful procedure it is? (Yes, I&#x27;m very guilty of doing that.) Lastly, if worse came to worse and I hated it, at least I would have a decent sonic brush I can use on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t ever expect to actually like - no- nearly fall in love with the Panasonic 4n1 epilator.  Being able to use it in the shower with your favorite body wash makes a huge difference.  Being able to use in in the shower is a huge plus to making epilating more comfortable experience. Having your hairs yank out is still unpleasant, but not completely unbearable, at least for me. With the heat of the shower my skin is relaxed and softened and the soothing foaming body wash helped make the epilating experience less of a hassle, less discomfort, and more effective. It was more sensitive around the knee area, but not undoable. Redness was minimal for me and I had no residual discomfort from the tweezing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The interchangeable flexible heads give this 4n1 epilator options that best fit your needs.  All the heads are well designed, work great, and are comfortable to use. The scrub brush does not go in circles, it vibrates quickly back and forth effectively cleaning without being harsh.  The smaller 3-blade wide tweezing head works great on my chin and upper lip area achieving better results than with the Emjoy single blade facial epilator I&#x27;ve been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Goods:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - The Panasonic 4n1 overall is well designed, well built and works fabulous. You get what you pay for. It&#x27;s water proof, works fantastic with body wash, and does an excellent job of epilating.&lt;br /&gt; - Strong tweezing blades work great even when wet and foaming with body wash.&lt;br /&gt; - The epilator has a generous 30 minute power supply that allows me to work as slow or as fast as I can comfortably can bear.  I worked both my lower legs on one charge with plenty more charge to go.&lt;br /&gt; - The flexible heads work smoothly with the curves of the body.&lt;br /&gt; - The sonic brush is gentle yet effective.&lt;br /&gt; - It has two speeds you can choose from.&lt;br /&gt; - The light is bright and useful.&lt;br /&gt; - Easy to understand instructions. (Read them! It provides valuable information to get the most out of your epilating experience.)&lt;br /&gt; - It manages to grab the short few-days-old razor stubble on my legs without a problem. Nice to know I don&#x27;t need to become \\&quot;scary hairy\\&quot; to epilate again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;meh\\&quot;:&lt;br /&gt; - While Panasonic does what it can to make epilating more comfortable, it does NOT eliminate the pain and discomfort you may encounter. It still hurts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the price, you certainly get what you pay for: quality, quality, quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The  Panasonic 4n1 has done the impossible. It has made me change my mind about epilating.  This is the way I will go for my legs for now on. Having days - DAYS - of stubble free legs is wonderful! I&#x27;ve yet to try it on the more sensitive areas like bikini or armpits (*cringes*) eventually I will work up my nerve to try it there too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold on using the Panasonic 4n1 Epilator for achieving hair-free legs and gladly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 01/28/15: I daringly enough tried the Panasonic epilator on my armpits. It definitely was more painful than doing my legs. Going slow using the gentle cycle, using lots of lather, relaxing, and breathing helped me bear through it. It was tricky in some of the deeper corners and some hairs extremely resistant, but I was able to get 98% of the hairs removed without damage to my skin or my sanity. It did sting in some places for a while afterwards, but the skin was smooth and looking great. I still recommend the Panasonic. Great device for epilating.out damage to my skin or my sanity.

    <li> My fiancee tried this epilator... the following is her opinion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were reviewing a medieval torture device, this would get an easy five stars.  It&#x27;s possible that I&#x27;m a wimp, and if so this is probably a great method of hair removal for women of a tougher constitution. But oh my, ouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the epilator as instructed, beginning with the gentle guard to help &amp;#34;reduce discomfort.&amp;#34;  All of my attempts were also in the shower, also suggested to help reduce said &amp;#34;discomfort.&amp;#34;  The first time, I used bar soap to lubricate my leg before epilating. I didn&#x27;t even make full contact with my skin before the awful stinging torture began.  Being a trooper, I stuck it out on a good-sized patch of my leg.  I could tell that it was removing hair, hence the stinging, but the area was not as clean as shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a second morning a few days later, I made another attempt, this time using much thicker shower gel.  Sadly, the results were still the same... I still thought that I should at least be getting a tattoo for the amount of pain I endured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few days post-epilator ordeal, I used the device with the exfoliation head.  It had a nice feel!  The brush may actually be a little too soft to be very effective as an exfoliator, but using it with shower gel did leave my skin feeling nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone wondering about battery life, it seemed to be good.  I have not used it extensively, for obvious reasons, but I only charged it once after first unpacking, and haven&#x27;t noticed a slow-down in the motor yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conclusion:  Epilation, and therefore this product, are not for me.  As an exfoliator, however, there may be some use for this product, but nothing that could not be accomplished by something much less expensive.</li>
    <li> So I gave this 4 stars because it works as promised not because it feels good doing it.  This product offers many different options with it which is nice. It has an extra head if you don&#x27;t want it to pull quite as bad as not using it but they both hurt :&amp;#62;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exfoliator tool is a nice bonus with this product and I will probably use that more than the hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does what it says but it is very painful.  The results are nice if you can get through the pain part. I could not get all the way through even one of my legs but having said that, it did a good job on the part I did do.</li>
    <li> This is a fine product my wife tells me. We were concerned about the pain reported by other reviewers.  She tried it&#x27;s heads on arms, legs, and under arms.  Unwanted hair was removed without fuss, bother or any pain.  For years she has been waxed.  No more.  And the brush was also to her liking.</li>
    <li> Unlike several reviewers, I don&#x27;t find the process of pulling out leg hair to be terribly painful. Sure, it hurts for a millisecond but then it&#x27;s over. All those times I cut my legs with a razor were much worse. What does hurt is when the two rollers somehow grab hold of my skin. This happened on one of my ankles. I have what are considered to be \\&quot;well-turned ankles,\\&quot; a phrase my dad used to use. They&#x27;re pretty skinny, yet the epilator grabbed some skin. In one instance, it even left a mark. There is a caution not to use it on certain areas that might have excess skin, but my ankle isn&#x27;t one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is quite effective in removing hair. I&#x27;ve tried it on my arms, legs, and face but probably won&#x27;t get near any \\&quot;other areas.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not very impressed by the scrubbing action. I also have a different brand of epilator and it has much more oomph. This product barely moves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is nice, it&#x27;s pretty, the switch works well, and it holds a charge for a long time. I just like my other brand more.</li>
    <li> Allow me to preface this review by saying that I am very much not a &amp;#34;beauty is pain&amp;#34; type … I like my beauty to be as unpainful as possible. I&#x27;ve never had anything waxed, preferring to shave to remove body hair, so that&#x27;s all I have to compare the experience of this hair removal product to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far as hair removal goes, this product performs decently. It does take a few sweeps of the same area to remove all the hair, and I even discovered several days later that I had missed a few spots, but it does provide excellent long-term hair removal: as I write this review, it&#x27;s been 6 days since I used it on my legs, and aside from the spots I&#x27;d missed, there&#x27;s no sign yet of regrowth. Definitely handy if you&#x27;re going to be traveling and don&#x27;t want to bother with lugging shaving accoutrements with you. Or if you&#x27;re lazy like me (or, also like me, have tiny children and have to work in showering/shaving time around their naps) and live somewhere with warm weather and don&#x27;t want to have to shave several times a week in order to keep smooth legs while wearing shorts (I am definitely looking forward to wearing shorts more often this summer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the downside. This thing HURTS (on both the speeds available). Like I prefaced, I&#x27;m not big on the whole pain for beauty thing, so I was gritting my teeth the whole time I was giving this thing a whirl. Of course, it&#x27;s yanking your hair out at the roots, so of course it hurts. If you&#x27;re a regular waxer, you probably wouldn&#x27;t mind it nearly as much. If you&#x27;re a regular shaver, it&#x27;ll take some getting used to, so whether the payoff of longer-term smooth legs is worth the pain is entirely up to you. Personally, I&#x27;ll probably stick with shaving unless I&#x27;m planning on traveling and/or planning on wearing shorts/skirts/dresses for several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The epilator comes with two heads: one for legs/arms/any other large space, and a smaller one for underarms/bikini line/other small space. I have not worked up the nerve to try the smaller one on the underarms or bikini line, but I suspect it works just the same as the larger one, which I have used on my legs. It also comes with a &amp;#34;gentle cap&amp;#34; that it recommends for beginners, but I hadn&#x27;t figured out how to use it when I was testing it out. Now that I&#x27;ve more closely read the book, I will give it another try (once I have hair to try it on again) and possibly update my review. There is also a &amp;#34;sonic exfoliation head&amp;#34; that is basically the most fantastic thing EVER. I am horrible on my feet, but using the exfoliation head in conjunction with my body scrub on my feet made that skin feel all soft and like new. Even if I never again used this to remove hair, I would continue to use the exfoliation head. We&#x27;re BFFs now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where stars are lost:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 star is lost due to the fact that I do have to make several sweeps of an area to remove all hair, regardless of what speed I have it on. Even the first few sweeps, before hair could potentially be causing a clog, don&#x27;t clear the area well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 star is lost due to the fact that my shower gel does not &amp;#34;lather&amp;#34; as the product materials suggest it should: both the box and the book recommend adding just a small drop of liquid shower gel to the epilation head after getting it wet, then running it to create a lather. This never happened with mine, and if I turned it off after trying to work up a lather, I could clearly see that the gel stayed entirely within the lines of the one blade area where it was initially applied. I eventually found that slathering my legs with shower gel first was the only way to get the epilation head to work up a lather.</li>
    <li> My wife returned this item because she said it was to painful.  I tried it out on an arm and a leg, (I did not completely remove all of the hair)  and it was slightly painful but bearable.  I think for someone with a higher pain threshold than my wife would get great use from this product but since she&#x27;s not happy I have to give it 3/5 stars.  Amazon was great about the return.</li>
    <li> Yes, it works like it&#x27;s supposed to, but the pain is just too much for me.  The hair does seem to take longer to grow back; of course, the root is gone, duh.  Seriously though, I could not tolerate the discomfort for more than a small section at a time.  My sister says that you get used to it or your roots get weaker or something because it doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad later.  I&#x27;ll give it a little longer and see if she&#x27;s right.  If so, I&#x27;ll update the review.  It&#x27;s cool that it works wet and that it comes with the brush, but those two things aren&#x27;t worth the price if I can&#x27;t tolerate using the epilator.  I&#x27;ll give it a three for now because it does work as advertised pain or not.</li>
    <li> I loved it!  I&#x27;ve used epilators for almost 30 years (Emjoi, Epilady, etc.), and this one works the best.  I especially love the light.  The charge holds really well, too.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> When we got belly rings, my best friend went first because she liked to say that I was the big baby.  Anyway, she said it didn&#x27;t hurt. I downed another tequila shot and went in to see the guy with the giant needle of fire who would pierce my navel.  There were not enough tequila shots to cover that pain.  People will say this doesn&#x27;t hurt either and they are not all big fat liars like my best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS was not THAT bad.  In fact, this one is probably the best of the epilators I have every used (3 or 4).  There are a couple of reasons I think this one works better:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;➢ This can be used wet.&lt;br /&gt;➢ It can be put on a slow speed.&lt;br /&gt;➢ I see what I am doing because of the light.&lt;br /&gt;➢ Uhm....oh yes, the pain stopped after awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being able to see what I was doing made a huge difference.  Yes, it is essentially tweezing each hair individually, but at least I saw that it only caused pain when it yanked out a hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes wonder what is wrong with women that they would use one of these devices of torture on their legs--and other body parts, EEEK--but then I remember, \\&quot;Oh, yeah, I use one of those.  I like that.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> That was my scream of agony.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed all the instructions, and there&#x27;s just not a chance I can use this to remove hair from my body.  HOLY CRAP.  Bikini line?  I wouldn&#x27;t let this thing NEAR my bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A complete waste for me.</li>
    <li> This multi use epilator is the front runner of its kind.  It comes with a nice carrying case, clear directions, charges quickly and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> This was my very first experience with an epilator. So yes, my first reaction was OUCH! I thought why would anyone choose this over waxing?!? But,  I gave it another try and I&#x27;m so glad I did. Here are some tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t try this on hair 1/2inch or longer. That had been my first, painful, mistake. Trim, shave/regrow, first if your hair is longer than 1/2inch. Trust me.&lt;br /&gt;-Soaking in a bath and using a gel helps, a lot. My first experience had been on dry skin and that left my skin irritated initially.&lt;br /&gt;-Do it more than once. It&#x27;s not like shaving..you&#x27;re going to have to go over the same area multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;-Easy around the lady parts. The looser the skin, the trickier it is. Legs/arms/between eyebrows&#x3D;a breeze. Bikini area&#x3D;tread carefully&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, SO, SO worth it! I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve gotten the same baby smooth results as waxing or shaving but it&#x27;s close. And, I love the convenience of it. It&#x27;s something I can do on my own time, unlike waxing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m cracking up reading the reviews here. I guess there is a huge cultural difference between Americans and Europeans, since we in France are used to epilators (yes we do take care of our hairs ;)) and feel practically no pain using it. Of course if you&#x27;ve always shaved this is probably going to look like the Friends&#x27; episode where Monica and Phoebe try this new waxing cream and almost cry from the pain it causes. But I can honestly say that among the 5/6 brands of epilators I&#x27;ve used in my life, this is by far the best one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re not American (JK), this product will suit you 100% :)</li>
    <li> I have an epilator I purchased some years ago and it hurts. I was hoping that time would result in a no pain epilation tool but alas when you yank hair out from the root - it hurts! This tool tries to minimize the pain with a variety of head attachments including one for sensitive areas and an exfoliation brush to help prepare the area. All very nice but it still hurts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s well made, feels good in the hand and can be used wet or dry. It also has LED light to make it easier to see what you are working on. This is a nice quality tool for epilation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One big drawback is it does not feature a shaver head. It&#x27;s nice to have that additional feature so you have another hair removal option and keeping it in one tool saves space and money.</li>
    <li> Note: I did not try this product, I am a guy. The idea of something pulling your hair out from the root is not something I am interested in - at all. That said, someone who has only a few hairs (got laser done) has used it, and more than the epilator the exfoliator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- She claims it hurts the same as other epilators. Maybe a little less, but she couldn&#x27;t tell.&lt;br /&gt;- The exfoliator works well, that&#x27;s the piece she likes the most of the set. I believe they call it here the &amp;#34;brush head&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;- She mentioned it saves money versus buying all the different pieces. Easy to switch between them.&lt;br /&gt;- Wet/dry use it in the shower or out&lt;br /&gt;- Battery life better than what she is used too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral:&lt;br /&gt;- Mentioned that it doesn&#x27;t include a shaver, and she is used to having epilators that include a shaving head. This one is only epilation and 4 pieces at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall she is glad it was offered here, and has been using the brush head almost daily.</li>
    <li> The women in my household, wife and daughters couldn&#x27;t wait for this product. Excited and mostly disappointed. In fairness they&#x27;d never tried one before, their issue is the pain involved in using it on their legs. They described it as &#x27;electricity&#x27; feeling when using it. One chose to keep it in spite of the pain. In fairness, it is a high quality product, well made with different heads for different applications. Didn&#x27;t sit well in our household.</li>
