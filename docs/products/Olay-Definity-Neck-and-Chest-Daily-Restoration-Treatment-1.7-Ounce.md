### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Wonderful product.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome.</li>
      <li>but I am very happy with this one.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s excellent.</li>
      <li>She likes it, and it is very nice they have a affordable product for the neck and chest at this price!  </li>
      <li>I gave it 4 stars because it is a very good, non greasy moisturizer that I use on my face and neck, I&#x27;ve had no problems with breakouts.</li>
      <li>This stuff feels great, not greasy, it goes on like silk.  </li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s great as a moisturizer</li>
      <li>The product was well-packaged, had a pleasant fragrance and texture, and did not feel greasy or sticky at all.</li>
      <li>I can see no problems at all with it, and because it&#x27;s Olay, it probably has a good effect on those with neck and throat skin problems.    </li>
      <li>I would recommend this product if you are looking for a good moisturizer, I use it on my face, nect and chest.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of damage, though I do have fair skin.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Conclusion, this product works acceptably and would make a good addition to one&#x27;s skincare routine if one doesn&#x27;t mind using an additional product.</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>I then gave it to a good friend who has her own business for women, doing intensive beauty treatments.</li>
      <li>This is a nice moisturizer.</li>
      <li>It has kind of an &#x27;Elmer&#x27;s Glue&#x27; consistency.      </li>
      <li>I have used it for 4 weeks and intentionally waited to write my review until I felt there was sufficient useage to warrent an honest opinion.  </li>
      <li>and if they are really doing the best job for me.</li>
      <li>would say that while this treatment is not a miracle cure, it is pleasant and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t too happy about it.  </li>
      <li>It is a nice consistency and absorbs easily into the skin.  </li>
      <li>Then I noticed that the blotches were around the many moles I had on my neck.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great as a lotion, but it really didn&#x27;t fade any age spots or discolorations.  </li>
      <li>The texture was smooth and it made my skin feel nice.</li>
      <li>This moisturizer is nice and light with out being greasy.</li>
      <li>So there is the opinion of this product from someone way more qualified than me to give their opinion on it.</li>
      <li>I liked the smooth feel that this moisturiser leaves on the skin</li>
      <li>I love OLAY products, though, and use them quite often.</li>
      <li>This has a nice feeling to it as you smooth it on.</li>
      <li>I love having a product dedicated to the often ignored neck and chest area.</li>
      <li>it would so far.she said her skin feels better and looks better.so...</li>
      <li>I ordered it for my wife since she is more inclined to believe the claims of products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m getting more and hoping that by the time I finish this one the freckles will be gone and the sun spots will be lighter.  </li>
      <li>Up to you... :)</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>My skin looked more even, the tan color was deeper, and the freckles seemed to fade.  </li>
      <li>Well this was my wife&#x27;s very first purchase of any speciality product for neck and chest, and she is very pleased that she gave it a try.</li>
      <li>It does feel pretty good and seemed to soothe.</li>
      <li>It felt like a very fine powder was in the application and it resulted in an extremely smooth feel on the neck.  </li>
      <li>She is a happy camper now that she has a new cream to add to her anti-aging regime.</li>
      <li>It smoothes in easily with no greasiness or residue.  </li>
      <li>She added that it felt like a masque when it was on, washed off easily and the effects disappeared when it was washed off.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>At first I liked the feel and texture of this lotion, serum,</li>
      <li>I can tell it has helped with fine lines but haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in discoloration.</li>
      <li>I have light freckles and sun spots on my arms</li>
      <li>It looks like a gel or serum inside, but when you pump it out, it&#x27;s a light foam.   </li>
      <li>Though I wanted to reduce the quantity being applied, I chose to follow the directions precisely in an effort to achieve this neck and chest \\&quot;restoration\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>Thankfully I got it for free thru the Amazon Vine program.</li>
      <li>Maybe with use over a longer period of time, I will be able to see some sort of difference, but right now I don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very nice sensation, but only time will tell if it prevents aging in that area!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 46 and don&#x27;t have any significant skin issues.</li>
      <li>I have long loved Olay&#x27;s moisturizers and think they typically put out wonderful products.  </li>
      <li>I was thrilled to have the opportunity to try this new Olay product.  </li>
      <li>That being said, the product is dispensed cleanly from a pump bottle.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It went on smoothly and seemed to absorb quickly.  </li>
      <li>The product is great, and I use it every single day.  </li>
      <li>In order to give this skin treatment a fair trial, I used it as directed once daily, applied liberally over my neck and chest, for a month-and-a-half.  </li>
      <li>This lotion goes on smoothly and easily and absorbs readily.</li>
      <li>I selected it, not because I thought it would do wonders for my manly, hairy chest, but because my wife was very interested in it.  </li>
      <li>I do notice positive results in fine lines.</li>
      <li>It is absorbed quickly into skin, no greasy feel.</li>
      <li>It makes her skin so smooth and silky throughout the day that she wants to touch it often.  </li>
      <li>So I already had absorbed quite a bit of sun by then.</li>
      <li>Olay&#x27;s Definity Neck &amp; Chest Daily Restoration Treatment is a nice moisturizer for the neck and chest area.</li>
      <li>She readily agreed to evaluate this and it took her 8 weeks to do a full evaluation.  </li>
      <li>I lilke very much.</li>
      <li>For the quality and results it is very reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>It is BETTER than other products of its kind, but apparently they are discontinuing this product.</li>
      <li>I have incredibly sensitive skin, and react to many topicals with rashes, itchiness, and redness, especially my neck, but my skin was totally fine with Definity Neck.</li>
      <li>I used it somewhat regularly and the effects were more pronounced as time passed.  </li>
      <li>Olay Definity works pretty well for me.  </li>
      <li>First off, I didn&#x27;t see any restoration in my neck and chest area.</li>
      <li>I love this, I&#x27;m only using it on my arms.  </li>
      <li>It actually seems to be more of a gel yet leaves no sticky residue.  </li>
      <li>I am an avid hiker and horsewoman since childhood, so I am outdoors quite a bit.  </li>
      <li>I have seen it in stores at higher prices.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant smell, something I tend to notice because my husband is sensitive to smells.  </li>
      <li>It feels positively silky when you apply it.  </li>
      <li>As long as it does not hurt me and works that way it says it will, I&#x27;m ok.</li>
      <li>I am 42, in good shape, and tan a few times a week in a high pressure bed.  </li>
      <li>However, if it&#x27;s effective long term, it could be worth enduring the daily applications.</li>
      <li>In a nutshell, this moisturizes fairly well (though not as well as some of Olay&#x27;s previous products) but as far as \\&quot;restoring\\&quot; the neck and chest, that isn&#x27;t going to happen.  </li>
      <li>I added a star just for the feel of the lotion which itself is very light and soft, but initially this was just a 2 star review.</li>
      <li>I ordered this from Vine weeks ago and have been using it religiously, just so I can give it time to work and then write an accurate review.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see much restorative effect</li>
      <li>but I really didn&#x27;t see any difference in my neck and chest.</li>
      <li>It is very silky and sort of feels like a powder.</li>
      <li>and I really like the silky feeling of this product that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky</li>
      <li>Ah, that is the real question</li>
      <li>You really shouldn&#x27;t expect your customers to write a book to rate a product.</li>
      <li>(It could be that I just use too much?)</li>
      <li>so my skin doesn&#x27;t get very irritated.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see much of a change in my skin&#x27;s appearance.  </li>
      <li>Is it not the real thing?  </li>
      <li>It absorbs well into the skin &amp; works very well in the short-term.  </li>
      <li>She loves it so much she applies some to her hands; she claims it feels and works well there too.</li>
      <li>In general this is a good product as long as you spend the $$$ for it and continue to use it on a regular basis.</li>
      <li>I have pretty sensitive skin</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This cream smells good in a clinical way, and after several weeks of use I can see an improvement in wrinkles on my forehead compared to the results of my usual night cream. However, the cream feels sticky on my skin, which I found rather unpleasant.  It has kind of an &#x27;Elmer&#x27;s Glue&#x27; consistency.      However, if it&#x27;s effective long term, it could be worth enduring the daily applications. Up to you... :)</li>
    <li> I have long loved Olay&#x27;s moisturizers and think they typically put out wonderful products.  I was thrilled to have the opportunity to try this new Olay product.  I have used it for 4 weeks and intentionally waited to write my review until I felt there was sufficient useage to warrent an honest opinion.  So....here it is.  In a nutshell, this moisturizes fairly well (though not as well as some of Olay&#x27;s previous products) but as far as \\&quot;restoring\\&quot; the neck and chest, that isn&#x27;t going to happen.  The lotion has a thicker consistency to it than most Olay lotions which makes it feel rather heavy going on and, for me, it felt so thick that I felt certain I was clogging my pores.  Though I wanted to reduce the quantity being applied, I chose to follow the directions precisely in an effort to achieve this neck and chest \\&quot;restoration\\&quot;.  The outcome after 4 weeks is a neck and chest that is moisturized (but no more so than before) but not \\&quot;restored\\&quot; -- there is truthfully no visible difference in the before and after treatment.  The last thing I would comment on is the price.  This product is expensive -- more expensive than a prescription lotion I was using for facial restoration (to rid my face uneven skin tone, acne scars, sun spots, etc...).  As much as I love Olay, I found this product to be a true disappointment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a skeptic by nature but I ordered this product anyway thinking the worse. I ordered it for my wife since she is more inclined to believe the claims of products. Miracle of miracles the cream actually works! I was surprised as she reported to me that it was terrific and could notice the difference before she puts the cream on and afterwards. I was still skeptical. She proved it by applying some slightly above her cleavage area and the wrinkles literally vanished! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. She uses it daily and swears by it. She loves it so much she applies some to her hands; she claims it feels and works well there too. According to my wifes experiences with the Olay cream she says it absorbs quickly and a small amount covers a large area.She says it blends into the skin with no oily visible difference on sun dried or aging skin. She is a happy camper now that she has a new cream to add to her anti-aging regime. I would recommend this cream if you are inclined to putting creams on to fight the effects of sun and aging because it seems to work.</li>
    <li> Well this was my wife&#x27;s very first purchase of any speciality product for neck and chest, and she is very pleased that she gave it a try. It makes her skin so smooth and silky throughout the day that she wants to touch it often.  This product works.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Does everything it says it will do and I began noticing the difference within a week.  My only complaint is that it took a good while to soak in and until it did it left my skin oily-shiny.  (It could be that I just use too much?) For the quality and results it is very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> First let me say that when the newsletter came out, this was the only product I could order... so I did. I then gave it to a good friend who has her own business for women, doing intensive beauty treatments. She readily agreed to evaluate this and it took her 8 weeks to do a full evaluation.  That said, she said that it does work... for a few hours. She added that it felt like a masque when it was on, washed off easily and the effects disappeared when it was washed off. At the end of 8 weeks there was no difference. She also stated it left a waxy feeling on her skin.  So there is the opinion of this product from someone way more qualified than me to give their opinion on it.</li>
    <li> I liked the smooth feel that this moisturiser leaves on the skin but this didn&#x27;t seem terribly restorative to me - just a layer of cream. I did not notice any noticeable reduction in spots, wrinkles, etc and will revert to using a different moisturiser with an SPF as part of it.</li>
    <li> This has a nice feeling to it as you smooth it on. It is very silky and sort of feels like a powder. It does not feel greasy at all and does not make my skin feel greasy if I sweat in it later. The only thing I do not like about this is the amount of plastic used for such a small amount of product.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my mom to try out. She used it for a bit but said that she didn&#x27;t notice any difference. Furthermore, she said it wasn&#x27;t any different from other moisturizers and also doesn&#x27;t have the SPF.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of a change in my skin&#x27;s appearance.  I used until the bottle was empty.  It did like how it made my chest and neck soft and silky, but other than that it didn&#x27;t improve the appearance of spots and dullness.  I also found the first few times I used this product I broke out a little on my chest and neck. This isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d recommend to friends or family.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile and I really like the silky feeling of this product that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky--just soft.  I have pretty sensitive skin and there is no problem with this lotion.</li>
    <li> This lotion goes on smoothly and easily and absorbs readily. It actually seems to be more of a gel yet leaves no sticky residue.  The product has absolutely no scent (a plus), and leaves a smooth, silky feel on the skin. I have incredibly sensitive skin, and react to many topicals with rashes, itchiness, and redness, especially my neck, but my skin was totally fine with Definity Neck. The product goes a long way and the 50 ml jar lasts a very long time, even with twice daily use. Does it work? Ah, that is the real question, is it not? That is certainly more difficult to assess. It does make the skin feel more moisturized and soft, but its harder to measure if it \\&quot;restores\\&quot; the skin. Does any over the counter topical do anything other than moisturize or soften?  Probably not, and if you expect it to, you should be using Retin A or other prescriptives (lasers or peels) from the dermatologist (although they come with side effects.)</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is nice and light with out being greasy. Being younger, I use it because I&#x27;m afraid of developing a wrinkly looking decolletage and because it leaves my skin feeling very soft and silky. It doesn&#x27;t take much, I usually use about two pea sized dollops to do my chest and neck right up to the line of my chin.    I always wonder, how&#x27;d they get the lotion into a spiral? Anyway the reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I&#x27;d like some spf in it for the summer time and because I don&#x27;t actually know enough about the long list of ingredients in it to know how and if they are really doing the best job for me.</li>
    <li> i gave this to my mom to try out and she claims it has done what it said it would so far.she said her skin feels better and looks better.so...i guess if you use the product even longer the results would continue to make improvements.</li>
    <li> Olay&#x27;s Definity Neck &amp; Chest Daily Restoration Treatment is a nice moisturizer for the neck and chest area. It&#x27;s not too heavy, but I also erred on the side of caution when applying it. Maybe with use over a longer period of time, I will be able to see some sort of difference, but right now I don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any issues with wrinkling, dry skin or sagging around my neck, so a product like this might seem to be useless. Thing is, if you use it, maybe you won&#x27;t have any issues with your neck!    That being said, the product is dispensed cleanly from a pump bottle. It is absorbed quickly into skin, no greasy feel. I can see no problems at all with it, and because it&#x27;s Olay, it probably has a good effect on those with neck and throat skin problems.    It&#x27;s very nice sensation, but only time will tell if it prevents aging in that area!</li>
    <li> I have never used anything like this before and when the Vine program asked me to review it, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.  I am 42, in good shape, and tan a few times a week in a high pressure bed.  I do have freckles, and my skin is a bit uneven in color.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this, I knew it was different from regular lotions.  It feels positively silky when you apply it.  Not greasy at ALL.  It almost feels dry immediately.  My skin looked more even, the tan color was deeper, and the freckles seemed to fade.  I used it somewhat regularly and the effects were more pronounced as time passed.  I don&#x27;t have a clue how they do it, but this works.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the effects will remain or not once you stop or have to take a break from the treatments.  I only gave it 3 stars because it is very expensive, and even though I like the product, I am not sure I&#x27;d fork out 30 bucks for it.</li>
    <li> I used this regularly and there really was no difference.  The texture was smooth and it made my skin feel nice.</li>
    <li> At first I liked the feel and texture of this lotion, serum, whatever you want to call it. It&#x27;s very light and absorbs quickly. It does feel pretty good and seemed to soothe. Let me start by saying I don&#x27;t have a lot of sun damage or wrinkles, but after tanning for a few years I recently stopped and wanted to get something that would help what little issues I had.  First off, I didn&#x27;t see any restoration in my neck and chest area. I ordered this from Vine weeks ago and have been using it religiously, just so I can give it time to work and then write an accurate review. I think it&#x27;s great as a moisturizer but I really didn&#x27;t see any difference in my neck and chest. Maybe because my skin isn&#x27;t in bad shape?? Not sure. It&#x27;s pretty expensive for a drugstore brand though, so I&#x27;m surprised it isn&#x27;t doing much or making any difference.  Secondly, this made me break out and caused a little redness the next day. I do not have very sensitive skin. I have olive toned, Mediterranean skin so my skin doesn&#x27;t get very irritated. But I did notice the day after I used this product, my whole chest area would be slightly red (almost like I had a minor sunburn) and I noticed small blemishes as well. These cleared up pretty quickly, but it is really inconvenient in the summer when you are wearing lower cut tops and tank tops to have redness and pimples.  All in all, I would not buy this, especially knowing what I know now. Thankfully I got it for free thru the Amazon Vine program. If I had bought this in a store and paid $30, it would have gone right back.  Why 3 stars then?? I added a star just for the feel of the lotion which itself is very light and soft, but initially this was just a 2 star review.</li>
    <li> This is like a slightly thicker version of Regenerist for the neck &amp; chest. Put it on and your skin feels so soft! I love it.</li>
    <li> I read about this product in Prevention Magazine but had a hard time finding it. I finally found it at Amazon and plan on using it as part of my daily routine from now on.  It&#x27;s excellent.</li>
    <li> I have used Oil of Olay&#x27;s products for 30 years.  I&#x27;ve decided to try this product. At first I wasn&#x27;t too happy about it.  After a few weeks I started noticing red blotches, but I kept on using it.  Then I noticed that the blotches were around the many moles I had on my neck.  Then my moles crusted over fell off one by one!!!  I am getting ready to buy my second bottle to tackle the moles on the back of my neck. Can&#x27;t wait.</li>
    <li> Olay Definity works pretty well for me.  It is a nice consistency and absorbs easily into the skin.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant smell, something I tend to notice because my husband is sensitive to smells.  This product hasn&#x27;t been a problem.  It leaves my neck and chest feeling soft.  I hadn&#x27;t noticed any huge difference in the general look of those areas, but there really wasn&#x27;t much wrong either.  I&#x27;m 46 and don&#x27;t have any significant skin issues.</li>
    <li> The product was well-packaged, had a pleasant fragrance and texture, and did not feel greasy or sticky at all. As for effectiveness, this was only a small sample size, so I would not be able to argue for or against its value, since long-term use would be necessary to make such a claim.</li>
    <li> I love having a product dedicated to the often ignored neck and chest area. It feels very luxurious going on the skin and doesn&#x27;t feel wet or sticky to the touch. It also has a barely detectable/neutral scent which I like. I would say it can be beneficial for any ages, particularly for people 30 and up. I feel my skin is protected after I apply it. Good product.</li>
    <li> I received this product as part of the Amazon Vine program.  I selected it, not because I thought it would do wonders for my manly, hairy chest, but because my wife was very interested in it.  Despite my doubts that she had room for yet another creme or lotion on her vanity, I ordered it.  Here&#x27;s what she had to say about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It went on smoothly and seemed to absorb quickly.  Unfortunately there was no noticable improvement, even after using the whole bottle (not at once, over time of course).  Worse, it left a film on her chest that peeled up if she rubbed her fingers on her chest.  That was her biggest complaint...she didn&#x27;t like the feeling of something on her skin if she touched it or of something coming off her chest if she rubbed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She had high hopes for the product but it just didn&#x27;t pan out for her.</li>
    <li> I had a dry spot that hurt and would itch(kinda like a cut, but not-hard to explain).  it totally healed now and no longer hurts or itches.  The only thing I am worried about though is that my bottle does not say Olay on it.  The box it came in said Oil of Olay, but the bottle does not say Olay like in the picture.  Is it not the real thing?  Well, it worked so I don&#x27;t mind I guess.  As long as it does not hurt me and works that way it says it will, I&#x27;m ok.</li>
    <li> I used this faithfully, but was a bit disappointed in the results.  It&#x27;s great as a lotion, but it really didn&#x27;t fade any age spots or discolorations.  Nothing changed that I could see, anyway.   Overall, I would definitely use it as a facial moisturizer, but not for the intended/advertised purpose.  I love OLAY products, though, and use them quite often.</li>
    <li> I have seen it in stores at higher prices. It works and I can&#x27;t currently find this in my area.</li>
    <li> It is a moisturizer that isn&#x27;t too heavy or oily. My skin is hydrated and soft, but I have noticed no change in my neck wrinkles. I could use my regular moisturizer for the same effect.</li>
    <li> This was sent as a Xmas gift for my eldest sister who is 73!  She likes it, and it is very nice they have a affordable product for the neck and chest at this price!  Every one of us has neck and chest issues after the age of 55!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of damage, though I do have fair skin.  I like the texture of this cream.  It looks like a gel or serum inside, but when you pump it out, it&#x27;s a light foam.   It smoothes in easily with no greasiness or residue.  I don&#x27;t see much restorative effect but it moisturizes well enough.</li>
    <li> Obviously nothing can cure the effects of aging; however, my wife has informed me that after using this product for several weeks she has noticed some improvement in skin health &amp; appearance; however, as noted nothing can reverse the effects of aging. Within a few days of stopping its use, the before affects re-appeared. In general this is a good product as long as you spend the $$$ for it and continue to use it on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> In order to give this skin treatment a fair trial, I used it as directed once daily, applied liberally over my neck and chest, for a month-and-a-half.  I am an avid hiker and horsewoman since childhood, so I am outdoors quite a bit.  However, I do live in a cooler part of the country and the sun is not as intense here as it is in the southern states or in California.  I am middle-aged now, and have moderate sun damage on my neck and chest.  I do use sunblock regularly, but the original sunblock ingredient, PABA, was only introduced when I was twelve or thirteen.  So I already had absorbed quite a bit of sun by then. I have liver spots and some darkened or reddish rougher patches on my neck and chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this cream for six weeks, I can say that I do see a slight improvement.  My skin feels softer, appears a bit smoother, and the spots are faded.  It is easier to cover the spots and sun-damaged patches with a tinted moisturizer when wearing a low-cut dress now than it was before I started the regimen.  The treatments had no effect on the slightly raised flat-topped mole-type growths which appear every once in awhile in this area -- one of which appeared when I was using this treatment.  My dermatologist removed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that while this treatment is not a miracle cure, it is pleasant and easy to use.  And it does have some positive effect on sun-damaged aged skin, so I would recommend it.  Just keep using sunblock, and keep seeing your dermatologist.</li>
    <li> This is a skin care product designed to fight sun spots, discoloration and dullness on the skin in the neck and chest area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the product for 60 days with the following results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. While I don&#x27;t perceive that I had any discoloration at the beginning of the trial, the overall \\&quot;look\\&quot; of my skin in the areas where the product was used was moderately improved.&lt;br /&gt;2. The skin looked less dry, more moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;3. Fine and some deep wrinkles were less defined resulting in a younger, smoother appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the product improved the feel and appearance of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle contains approximately 60 (1 pump) applications - good for two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also worth noting, I noticed a dry lubricant feel from the product during the first week of use.  It felt like a very fine powder was in the application and it resulted in an extremely smooth feel on the neck.  After that, it (the dry lubricant feel) was no longer present.  I suspect an active ingredient was present in larger quantities during the initial use of the product, possibly due to inadequate mixing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does not contain a suncreen additive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion, this product works acceptably and would make a good addition to one&#x27;s skincare routine if one doesn&#x27;t mind using an additional product.</li>
    <li> This is a nice moisturizer. I have used it for 4 weeks now, and it is empty. I can tell it has helped with fine lines but haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in discoloration. I use sunscreen everyday. I put the Olay Definity Neck and chest daily restoration Treatment, then the sunscreen, but don&#x27;t see any changes in discoloration. I do notice positive results in fine lines. This has a matted type finish so there is no greasiness part way through the day. I would recommend this product if you are looking for a good moisturizer, I use it on my face, nect and chest. But for discoloration related to sun damage you will either need a stronger product, ormore patience! I gave it 4 stars because it is a very good, non greasy moisturizer that I use on my face and neck, I&#x27;ve had no problems with breakouts.</li>
    <li> This stuff feels great, not greasy, it goes on like silk.  I have tried some of Olay&#x27;s new stuff but found it too greasy, this feels like a high end serum.  As far as improvement on the looks on my chest I do see a little but what really has sold me on this is the way it feels on:)</li>
    <li> I love this, I&#x27;m only using it on my arms.  I have light freckles and sun spots on my arms (so ugly) after one bottle the freckles on my arms are way lighter.  I&#x27;m getting more and hoping that by the time I finish this one the freckles will be gone and the sun spots will be lighter.  I am always skeptical about beauty products, rarely find one that I feel like it does what it claims but I am very happy with this one.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. With age, and living in Florida, the skin on my décolletage was starting to look like alligator skin. In less than a moth I saw a dramatic change! I can&#x27;t understand why Oil of Olay stopped making this product!</li>
    <li> I lilke very much. Skin looks moisturized and soft.</li>
    <li> I never got this product that I order so I have to find out what happened with my refund,..I had purchased it last year and I was amazed at the results,great treatment for neck and chest the reason why I gave it a 5!!!</li>
    <li> Use it on my chest and neck. It is BETTER than other products of its kind, but apparently they are discontinuing this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an Olay Regenerist junkie so I will try anything that Olay Regenerist makes.  This is for the neck and Chest.  It does make your skin very soft.  I would recommend it to anyone.  In fact, I&#x27;m almost out so I will be orering another one.</li>
    <li> The product is great, and I use it every single day.  You really shouldn&#x27;t expect your customers to write a book to rate a product.</li>
    <li> ...but I do like the way this product feels.  It absorbs well into the skin &amp; works very well in the short-term.  Long-term results remain to be seen.</li>
