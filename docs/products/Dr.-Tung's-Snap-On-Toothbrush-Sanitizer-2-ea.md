      <li>Nice idea, I like it.  </li>
      <li>Nice product</li>
      <li>It snaps on and off very easily.</li>
      <li>But I like having some kind of a sanitizing cover on my toothbrush and my dentist said that my gums looked better after using Tung&#x27;s toothbrush</li>
      <li>Easy to use!</li>
      <li>GREAT PRODUCT, FAST SHIPPING!</li>
      <li>A great way to keep your toothbrush clean and fresh when traveling!</li>
      <li>Love this item.  </li>
      <li>I use it all the time and feel so much better knowing no germs or bacteria can get in my toothbrush before I put it in my mouth.&lt;br</li>
      <li>i love the product.  </li>
      <li>I checked out Dr. Tung&#x27;s webpage for more information, but ended up having to research even further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love&#x27;em</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use these for &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; travel, but when I go out to do field work in the jungle, I love this thing.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t tried them yet, but I love lemons</li>
      <li>so I hope they go well with my mint toothpaste! :)</li>
      <li>I do feel better knowing that my traveling toothbrush is sanitized.</li>
      <li>Smells okay.</li>
      <li>Love them - even ordered more for when it&#x27;s time to replace</li>
      <li>So glad I purchased this toothbrush sanitizer.  </li>
      <li>just okay.</li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>Effective and inexpensive way to keep your toothbrush head clean and sanitized when not in use.</li>
      <li>if you like keeping your toothbrushes nice and clean.</li>
      <li>I had been searching for more of these toothbrush holders for some time, and was excited to find them on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Easy to use</li>
      <li>Great for every day use, especially if you share your toothbrush cup with others</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit my &amp;#34;chunky&amp;#34; sonic toothbrush - doesn&#x27;t quite close which does defeat the purpose.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t really investigated whether this works, but I&#x27;d love to find out more about it.</li>
      <li>Very handy if you want to protect your toothbrush from germs, especially when travelling.</li>
      <li>Snaps on perfectly providing a solid fit compared to the old rubber cover.</li>
      <li>I am going to use an ultraviolet case from now on though, more effective overall.</li>
      <li>I had an electric sanitizer that I used to have to clean and sanitize monthly for my sonic brush</li>
      <li>They keep the brush heads fresh and odor free.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still not convinced the claim that EcoPure speeds biodegration is true.</li>
      <li>My toothbrush always feels so fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure if I had left it there for more hours</li>
      <li>These cases are good, seem to work as described and for as long as advertised.</li>
      <li>It would probably be a better design if it clicked open and shut instead of being lightly super-glued.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only had this for a couple of weeks, but so far, so good.  </li>
      <li>I love the built humidity trapper function that keeps your toothbrush dry and clean.</li>
      <li>Even if they don&#x27;t sanitize it is nice to have a tight cover on the toothbrush to help it keep clean in the bathroom sitting in a cup.  </li>
      <li>Whether or not they actually sanitize the brush is up for debate (which is to say more research than I care to do)</li>
      <li>I give them as gifts because I like them so much!</li>
      <li>The price is much higher in supermarkets.</li>
      <li>It seems to be exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>So honestly, I just bought these, at a local natural foods store, to use as a toothbrush cover.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to keep your toothbrush fresh and in tact</li>
      <li>Been using these for a few years and am very satisfied.  </li>
      <li>Slight scent of some kind of oil essence, but it does not transfer to the bristles or spin head.</li>
      <li>I could never find any empirical reports on the success of this product in killing germs.  </li>
      <li>However, I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s part of the whole sanitizing process or not.</li>
      <li>Not frustrating at all.  </li>
      <li>They fit the larger brushes also.  </li>
      <li>Hopefully it really does sanitize the toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that as it grows closer to the time to replace it the granules seem to swell up - as if they&#x27;re absorbing moisture.</li>
      <li>I felt that the toothbrush never fully drying isn&#x27;t very sanitary even if it is sanitized.  </li>
      <li>The rate of decomposition is VERY subjective, depending on where they are in the landfill, where the landfill is located, how the landfill works, and many other factors, including if they are inside a plastic trash bag.</li>
      <li>Plus the UV sanitizers are a pain to clean and you have to constantly replace the batteries.</li>
      <li>I broke it almost immediately, through my own urge to see if I could pop open the door and add more essential oil to the little compartment that the vapors issue from....</li>
      <li>The picture shows the older sanitizer which I was hoping for but instead I received the newer version.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I received  the new one count with 2 refills.</li>
      <li>For a long time I was using the UV toothbrush holder/sanitizers, but they continually wear out and get grunge in them (if they&#x27;re really sanitizing, how do they get grunge in them?!?!?)</li>
      <li>far as functionality,  we shall see!</li>
      <li>Anyways, I was preparing to travel and first saw these in the local health food store.</li>
      <li>So, between the wet toothbrush and not keeping me healthy, I decided not to use this anymore and just let my toothbrush dry!</li>
      <li>My toothbrush never dried in this holder.  </li>
      <li>These you just replace every two months - a cost much lower than the UV units and a continual need to replace their batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging says that the granules, which are in a tiny container on the front of the unit, contain lemon oil, clove oil, peppermint oil.</li>
      <li>and I at least feel like things are being kept bacteria free.</li>
      <li>not sure just how much I believe they are really compostable, as someone else stated, or biodegradable, as stated on the packaging.</li>
      <li>It keeps the toothbrush dry and ready for next use.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t taste anything weird on my toothbrush, and it seems pretty clean.</li>
      <li>only all natural essential oils used.  </li>
      <li>and it was far more expensive than these sanitizers that do not require cleaning.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This sounded like a great idea so I ordered one.  The only downside is it lasts just 60 days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of these.  My toothbrush never dried in this holder.  I&#x27;m sure if I had left it there for more hours it might have eventually dried.  But I brush my teeth twice a day so I need it to dry before then.  I felt that the toothbrush never fully drying isn&#x27;t very sanitary even if it is sanitized.  I could never find any empirical reports on the success of this product in killing germs.  In the couple of weeks I was using it, I did get a respiratory infection and a few cold sores in my mouth.  I am in no way saying that this product caused those things to happen.  But the product also did not prevent them from happening.  So, between the wet toothbrush and not keeping me healthy, I decided not to use this anymore and just let my toothbrush dry!</li>
    <li> I use it all the time and feel so much better knowing no germs or bacteria can get in my toothbrush before I put it in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I received a package with one sanitizer and two refills, instead of two sanitizers like is pictured. For the price, I would have purchased a different product if I had known I was only getting one.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and I plan to replace every three months for increased protection.</li>
    <li> I always wanted a way to protect my toothbrush from the bathroom air, so I put a paper cup over it, but this item is the perfect solution! My toothbrush always feels so fresh and clean. Perfect product!</li>
    <li> Works well but not sure I like the taste left on the toothbrush.  Does what it&#x27;s meant to do though!</li>
    <li> Service was excellent!  I got the item in no time but not happy with it.  The picture shows the older sanitizer which I was hoping for but instead I received the newer version.  The newer product has snap in caps and it&#x27;s just not the same.  Bummed out.  Picture needs to be changed to reflect the newer product now being sold.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a couple of weeks, but so far, so good.  The two pack comes with each cover sealed from each other, so you only need to open one at a time.  I can&#x27;t taste anything weird on my toothbrush, and it seems pretty clean.</li>
    <li> great item.  When I went through the process to reorder it,  I suddenly discovered that the price doubled.  At the new price not worth it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s always a pleasure to discover hard-to-find-in-store products. I had been searching for more of these toothbrush holders for some time, and was excited to find them on Amazon. Excellent product, will order again, and thank you for making this available here. Only dislike is that the shape has changed from a couple of years ago, and the extra filters do not fit the older models.</li>
    <li> For a long time I was using the UV toothbrush holder/sanitizers, but they continually wear out and get grunge in them (if they&#x27;re really sanitizing, how do they get grunge in them?!?!?) Anyways, I was preparing to travel and first saw these in the local health food store. I decided to try them instead of the portable UV case I would usually use and I&#x27;ve been using them ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My toothbrush doesn&#x27;t get any build up around the bristles since using these - it seemed like there was always a tiny bit of build up when using the UV sanitizers. Plus the UV sanitizers are a pain to clean and you have to constantly replace the batteries. These you just replace every two months - a cost much lower than the UV units and a continual need to replace their batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging says that the granules, which are in a tiny container on the front of the unit, contain lemon oil, clove oil, peppermint oil. tea tree oil and thyme oil. I&#x27;ve noticed that as it grows closer to the time to replace it the granules seem to swell up - as if they&#x27;re absorbing moisture. However, I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s part of the whole sanitizing process or not.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT, FAST SHIPPING!</li>
    <li> I received different package than shown on the picture: it has one container and 2 replacements. I like that it&#x27;s only oils</li>
    <li> Even if they don&#x27;t sanitize it is nice to have a tight cover on the toothbrush to help it keep clean in the bathroom sitting in a cup.  They fit the larger brushes also.  Nice product and they are well packed.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit my &amp;#34;chunky&amp;#34; sonic toothbrush - doesn&#x27;t quite close which does defeat the purpose.  Would be great on compact head manual toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Have used this before in a mint flavor. This time, I got lemon. Haven&#x27;t tried them yet, but I love lemons so I hope they go well with my mint toothpaste! :)</li>
    <li> Kids like them and that&#x27;s all I care about!!</li>
    <li> Gave these a try on a whim.  Whether or not they actually sanitize the brush is up for debate (which is to say more research than I care to do) but they do make them smell and taste good.  Frankly that&#x27;s enough to warrant the cost for someone who has a lot of toothbrushes around.  Great for travel as it doubles as a brush cover.  Four stars only due to the limited lifespan (60 days according to the package) and lack of refills.</li>
    <li> does the job. If anything it makes a great toothbrush cover</li>
    <li> This offer says 72 count, but shows one with refills?</li>
    <li> So far so good! Easy to use!</li>
    <li> I so like having a protectant for my toothbrush after hearing for years how all that bacteria float around the bathroom when you flush. Nothing like having a load of bacteria land on the brush you put in your mouth.....ugggghhh. These caps fit perfectly and are quite easy....Love&#x27;em</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really investigated whether this works, but I&#x27;d love to find out more about it. In any case I love using this! Hopefully it really does sanitize the toothbrush.  If upon further investigation I find out that it does, then I would definitely give it five stars.  In the meantime, sometimes ignorance is bliss and who knows maybe just thinking it works is enough.</li>
    <li> We travel for work and these are the best way to keep toothbrushes clean and sanitary. I have not found anything else comparable.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if these are working or not...I mean, how can you tell?  But I like having some kind of a sanitizing cover on my toothbrush and my dentist said that my gums looked better after using Tung&#x27;s toothbrush, so I decided this was the thing for me.  I will keep on using them.</li>
    <li> So glad I purchased this toothbrush sanitizer.  It keeps the toothbrush dry and ready for next use. It snaps on and off very easily. Not frustrating at all.  It works! I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this item.  Will be so great for traveling.</li>
    <li> A must have for your toothbrush</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a replacement cover for my [[ASIN:B003UKKH6O Oral-B Vitality Prowhite Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]]. Snaps on perfectly providing a solid fit compared to the old rubber cover. Slight scent of some kind of oil essence, but it does not transfer to the bristles or spin head. Nice product, good price.</li>
    <li> Very handy if you want to protect your toothbrush from germs, especially when travelling. The price is much higher in supermarkets.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product to keep your toothbrush fresh and in tact</li>
    <li> It seems to be exactly as advertised. I&#x27;ll recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use these for &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; travel, but when I go out to do field work in the jungle, I love this thing. I am not sure how much it really &amp;#34;sanitizes&amp;#34; but it helps keeps bugs from traipsing all over it and I at least feel like things are being kept bacteria free. It fits on my Diamond Sonicare toothbrush head.</li>
    <li> This product arrived when it said it would.  It works great.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my granddaughter, and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I ordered TWO covers as pictured in the description but the package I received on contained ONE. False advertising ?&lt;br /&gt;Like the product but feel ripped off.</li>
    <li> Been using these for a few years and am very satisfied.  They hold up well, only has broken over the years we&#x27;ve used.  I like keeping our toothbrushes protected from whatever germs might be generated in the bathroom.  I have used the compartments that come with electric toothbrushes, but they get very dirty quickly and are not easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Good price for product.</li>
    <li> Great cover. Slight hint of a smell from the little charcoal container though, and sometimes settles onto the bristles.</li>
    <li> Nice idea, I like it.  I broke it almost immediately, through my own urge to see if I could pop open the door and add more essential oil to the little compartment that the vapors issue from....my bad!  It would probably be a better design if it clicked open and shut instead of being lightly super-glued.  Just me.</li>
    <li> Great product and easy to use.  Directions are easy to follow for best results.  I like the idea that each steripod lasts for three months.  I will recommend this products to my relatives and friends.</li>
    <li> A great way to keep your toothbrush clean and fresh when traveling! I give them as gifts because I like them so much!</li>
    <li> I love the built humidity trapper function that keeps your toothbrush dry and clean. Great product if you like keeping your toothbrushes nice and clean. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> i love the product.  only all natural essential oils used.  wonderful.  i&#x27;m tellin all my friends and will keep a stock of these on hand.  great stocking stuffers for the holidays as well!</li>
    <li> Product came as described. Can&#x27;t say if it sanitizes my toothbrush or not because I&#x27;m not a scientist. However, the toothbrush sits in the shower, and doesn&#x27;t have any mildew or smell...so I guess we can credit Dr. Tung!</li>
    <li> I received  the new one count with 2 refills. Not what I wanted. I actually needed a two count, one for me and one for hubby. They need to change the pic and title of this if they are going to change the product. False advertising I say!&lt;br /&gt;As far as functionality,  we shall see! Guess I&#x27;ll have to order another one.</li>
    <li> I caught one of my cats chewing on my toothbrush and thought that was just disgusting. I then started wondering how long she&#x27;s been doing this? She&#x27;s 13!!  Good thing I soak my toothbrushes in hydrogen peroxide every week to sanitize them. Of course, when I saw her doing this I immediately soaked it again. So honestly, I just bought these, at a local natural foods store, to use as a toothbrush cover. One for home and one for travel. I didn&#x27;t even know they were a sanitizing product, must be the tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure just how much I believe they are really compostable, as someone else stated, or biodegradable, as stated on the packaging. I checked out Dr. Tung&#x27;s webpage for more information, but ended up having to research even further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what I found out:&lt;br /&gt;The covers are plastic. There is no recycle code on them. They are treated with something called EcoPure. I had no idea what EcoPure was, so I looked it up on the web and found their website. I&#x27;m still not convinced the claim that EcoPure speeds biodegration is true. They will still take a long time to biodegrade, they cause pollution when being made and disposed of, and they are not a natural material. Plastic is plastic is plastic. The rate of decomposition is VERY subjective, depending on where they are in the landfill, where the landfill is located, how the landfill works, and many other factors, including if they are inside a plastic trash bag. So, I&#x27;ve decided to return them without even opening the packaging. I don&#x27;t want something I&#x27;ll have to throw out and replace every two months.</li>
    <li> Great company but these...just okay. It&#x27;s a PIA to have to use two hands to open and close these each time...just takes too long.</li>
    <li> Effective and inexpensive way to keep your toothbrush head clean and sanitized when not in use. I buy enough of these to last a year and reorder as needed. They keep the brush heads fresh and odor free. I had an electric sanitizer that I used to have to clean and sanitize monthly for my sonic brush and it was far more expensive than these sanitizers that do not require cleaning.</li>
    <li> Love them - even ordered more for when it&#x27;s time to replace</li>
    <li> Smells okay. I do feel better knowing that my traveling toothbrush is sanitized. Took me a while to figure out how to open these without breaking my fingernails, though.</li>
    <li> This is a great product</li>
    <li> Great for every day use, especially if you share your toothbrush cup with others :-)&lt;br /&gt;We are a small family of three, but when one gets a cold, I&#x27;m convinced that the other two don&#x27;t get it because we have our sanitizers to shield against some of the germs.  As holistic health practitioners, we don&#x27;t use hand sanitizers or even over-the-counter medications, but these sanitizers have become a staple in our bathroom for several years.&lt;br /&gt;Addtionally, the perfect travelling cover for your toothbrush!</li>
    <li> These cases are good, seem to work as described and for as long as advertised. I like that they are compostable. I am going to use an ultraviolet case from now on though, more effective overall.</li>
