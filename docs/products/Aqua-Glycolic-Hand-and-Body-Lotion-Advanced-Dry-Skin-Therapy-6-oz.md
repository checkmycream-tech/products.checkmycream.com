      <li>This is the most effective lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

      <li>I have always put lotion on my hands but figured there wasn&#x27;t much more I could do.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Thsi lotion was recommended to me years ago by my dermatologist, and it is still one of my favorite products, asit does what it says</li>
    <li> I have bern using this on my heels for years now.  I have baby oft skin because of it.  I highly recommend this product .  Use it on your body, on your elbows and on your feet.  You will be amazed. Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Feels like any other lotion you can buy from the store. There is nothing special here. It is just another over priced item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this condition all of my life and this lotion keeps those bumps in check. It also works well on mild cases of psoriasis or eczema, or dry skin from hypothyroid. I like to use this at least once a day, twice a day on knees and elbows. It works great. It can sting a little bit if there are any open areas of skin, but that&#x27;s pretty minor. I sometimes swap with Weleda Sea Buckthorn lotion when the weather gets cold and dry....also works well for KP. This product is a lifesaver, I no longer fear wearing shorts or short sleeved shirts. It takes a week or so to smooth the bumps down, but it&#x27;s worthwhile to have patience. Leaves my skin silky smooth and glowing!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 20 years and my skin still looks \\&quot;almost\\&quot; youthful.</li>
    <li> Aqua Glycloic is an excellent lotion and the  healing lubricants in this lotion help keep my skin on my legs and arms  subtle and soft. I like this lotion very much.      A.</li>
    <li> Great lotion, been using it for years.</li>
    <li> I love this hand lotion.  It makes my hands feel softer and clears up the dry areas.</li>
    <li> Have used for 3 weeks now and can completely feel a difference. Have very dry and sun damaged 46 year old skin that now has a new lease on life.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that fixes my severe dry, winter skin. It heals cracks in hands and heels and keeps them from coming back. It also helps clear up ingrown hairs and those bumps on the back of my upper arms.</li>
    <li> I have used Aqua Glycolic Lotion for years after it was recommended by my dermatologist for treating the excema on my hands. Provided I remember to use it regularly, it works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it was recommended by my dermatologist.  She said this item has the highest percentage of glycolic acids (14%).  She recommended this because I have some brown/dark spots on my face.  I bought my first bottle and use it for more than 3 months now (twice daily) on my face and the spots has faded quite a lot.  I used it as part of my skin care routine in the mornings and nights and I use a very high SPF sunblock in the day, everyday.  I would recommend this product to those who wants to lighten their spots.  But you must be patient.  It is not a miracle cream that will make your spots disappear overnight. As I said, it took me about 3 months to see the spots fading gradually.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This lotion has controlled my eczema very well.  No other lotion or creams I have tried before can.</li>
    <li> I either didnt need it or it doesnt work, period! I have better luck with baby oil or vaseline intensive care or the generic. Good luck to you all. I&#x27;m not saying it isnt good, its just - not for me.</li>
    <li> It takes time, but the results are amazing.  Nice smooth skin and well hydrated, this from a 70+ grandma!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter with the recommendation from our dermatologist when she complained of those little bumps on the back of her arms. She had a noticable problem with keratosis. She put this lotion on after her bath each evening and within 3 days there was a noticable difference in the reddness and feel to the bumps. If she uses it reguarly, they fade but don&#x27;t totally go away. They do return in full force if she stops use. All in all, it&#x27;s the best thing I have found to help....and without a prescription.</li>
    <li> I thoroughly researched this product and given the reviews, had high expectations that ultimately were not met. To be blunt, it does nothing and is not worth the money. I don&#x27;t understand the reviewers who like this product and see improvements - I wish I did - but would not purchase this again nor would I recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin after years of being off and on accutane for acne and I had lost hope that my skin would ever feel soft and smooth again. This lotion changed my skin and made it so soft and moisturized. I just ordered two more bottles. Highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> The very best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> Having extreme dry skin and rough elbows,my doctor told me about this product. It REALLY works! I see a marked improvement after a weeks use.</li>
    <li> Do not remember ordering this.  May&#x27;ve I purchased it as a g8ft.</li>
    <li> My sister lives in a very dry climate and is always trying new moisturizing products.  When I was visiting she raved about the Aqua Glycolic Hand &amp; Body Lotion.  It was sold right there in here dermatologist&#x27;s office, so we stopped by to get some for me.  I am nearly 65 and can use all the help I can get!  So, I took it home, tried it out, and am I happy!  This lotion is very thin, more like a milky serum, glides on very smoothly, isn&#x27;t sticky, and keeps my skin moisturized all day.  Also, my sister told me her dermatologist said there is no need to purchase their facial lotions, as this will do the same thing. Being a thin consistency it also lasts longer than thicker lotions, making it well worth the (approximately) $20.  Go for it!</li>
    <li> this product was recommended to me by my dermatologist. i have skin that is too sensitive to tolerate any scented items, or anything with harsh chemicals. I cant even wash my clothes with scented soap or Bounce.    Aveeno has some nice products too, but it can leave you feeling a bit greasy. Aqua Glycolic is the only product that dosn&#x27;t bother my skin. I highly recommend it to anyone has sensitive skin. Its an over the counter item so you will probably need a derma&#x27;s recommendation.</li>
    <li> If you are over 50 years old you will appreciate the way this product works. It drastically improves the look of aging skin especially on your legs, arms and hands.&lt;br /&gt;There is no leftover greasy feel after application. I have been using this either once or twice a day for the past year and love it. If you have extremely sensitive skin you may encounter slight burning with the first couple applications, however I did not.</li>
    <li> It made my skin soft and moisturized. Will buy again</li>
    <li> I bought this along with the face kit that comes with cleanser, toner and cream. I love the facial stuff and purchased this at the same time and it works well for my hands and body.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really good for smoothing out rough skin. I suffer from folliculitis and after the first day I could feel a difference in the texture of my skin. The reason I give it 4/5 stars is because it burns a bit. I think though, after my skin gets used to the high glycolic content (17%), it won&#x27;t burn as much.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  I have used it for yrs. on both face and arms. Fades brown spots with long time usage.</li>
    <li> If you like Aqua Glycolic, re-post your review to my new Aqua Glycolic discussion (tagged aqua glycolic). We will be picking some of these to feature on the new site. (your first name will be all that&#x27;s visible under the review). thanks!![[ASIN:B000T7P0KO Aqua Glycolic Face Cream, 2-Ounces]]</li>
    <li> Excellent body cream, especially for the bottom of your feet, helps sooth aching feet and softens your skin and buying from Amazon the price was very very good.  I am buying automatic reorder every three months for three 16 oz. bottles. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I originally was only going to purchase the Aqua Glycolic face care products (toner, face wash and face cream).  However after reading numerous reviews of the entire Aqua Glycolic line, I added in the body lotion at the last minute.  (Only because Amazon was offering a discount if you purchased over a certain threshhold of AG products.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW!  This lotion is awesome!  The first time that I  applied it I thought to myself \\&quot;This doesn&#x27;t seem like much.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s thin in consistency and didn&#x27;t seem like it was going to be very moisturizing.  In fact after massaging it in to my hands, arms and legs I felt as if I had applied nothing at all.  I figured that this was going to be added to the collection of other skin care products that I never finished (but find very difficult to throw away....)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later that day I noticed that my hands felt smooth and soft.  (Even after being washed several times already.)  I still wasn&#x27;t convinced and chalked it up to a fluke or that maybe one of the hand soaps that I has used during the day was the reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That evening I noticed that my arms and legs felt very soft and smooth too.  I knew that wasn&#x27;t due to hand soap that I had used during the day.  I thought \\&quot;What the heck, I&#x27;ll try it agin this evening before bed.\\&quot;  Then I used it again after my morning shower.  The results have been astounding!  I am a forty something woman that had abused my skin with the sun for far too many years.  After my third week of using this lotion, I have noticed that my cuticles are so much better.  My arms and legs feel softer than I can ever remember and my feet feel like I just had a pedicure.  This lotion is a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to my heavily sun damaged and dry skin I&#x27;ve always had to use heavier, thicker lotions to \\&quot;feel mositurized\\&quot;.  I now realize that the \\&quot;moisture\\&quot; that I felt was not my skin itself but the layer of product on my skin.  After I would wash my hands or shower, my skin would still be as dry and flakyas before.  With the AG Body Lotion I can apply it in the morning after my shower and feel smooth and moisturized all day.(Without a greasy feeling too!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I wish that they sold this product in a larger bottle and offered it in a purse size tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I am happy with the other AG products that I purchased, it is the body lotion that I absolutely can&#x27;t live without.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product but it just didn&#x27;t do it for me. I have been happy with glycolic products for my face, but this did nothing for my hands or legs other than making them drier.</li>
    <li> Aqua Glycolic Hand &amp; Body Lotion was recommended to me by my dermatologist.  I was told to use it twice a day.  I&#x27;ve been using it about 6 weeks and I&#x27;m very pleased.  My skin is clearer and very smooth.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion.  I use it around my nose area to help against chaffing from my new CPAP. It&#x27;s not greasy and that&#x27;s plus</li>
    <li> Aqua Glycolic hand and body lotion and body wash/shampoo were recommended by my dermatologist to prevent occurance of small skin growths, keratoses,little bumpies, etc., all non-cancerous, though I do have a history of skin cancer.  Though the product won&#x27;t entirely erase existing problems, it has lightened, eliminated and prevented to the degree that my skin is at least 90% improved, and my back had a lot of keratoses. It absolutely works as a preventive &amp; curative measure and does even skin tone remarkably well.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about one year, as a body lotion after bathing, along with the body wash.  The results are very noticeable. It makes a big difference, and I will continue using it.  Highly recommended. Oh! And my husband who has been applying it to my back about 3-4 times a week works in construction and had very dry calloused hands. His hands have improved dramatically, too!</li>
    <li> The original cream was wonderful  Company changed the formula completely and by reading the label you can see that the magical ingredient glycolic acid is the fourth ingredient and water is the first this cream is useless and it is unethical  to sell it as the same cream with a new name&lt;br /&gt;I have called the company and notify them of this travesty</li>
    <li> I use this lotion on all my body but I especially use it on my hands and feet that are so dry. My skin feels very soft now.</li>
    <li> The product is fabulous, but the shipping packaging is horrible.  Some of the bottles were broken and the product leaked out.  Mary</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and a fair complexion. The dermatologist recommended this to me as a means to help my skin maintain moisture. I was impressed that this does not require a prescription and can be used safely. For me, this product has made all the difference in skin maintenance.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  I have stayed away from most lotions in the past because they were either too greasy, too flowery or too harsh. This one is perfect for me.  A little dab will do you.  And, I&#x27;m extremely happy.  This will be the only hand and body lotion I will use from now on.  Even the packaging is just right.  Stands upright and pump works smoothly.  Through the years I&#x27;ve had numerous, numerous recommendations from people who considered their lotion to be the best.  None of them were.  This one definitely is.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me to help with sun damaged skin on my arms. I love this product as it helps with the sun damage (I grew up in the Florida sun) and makes my skin feel soft and smooth.  I usually have to purchase this lotion at CVS from the pharmacy (you have to ask for it) so I&#x27;m happy to see I can get it from Amazon and at a better price too!</li>
    <li> The first time I ordered this I was just hoping it would help my hands a little. I have dermatitis on my hands, and on my bad days my hands have small cuts. On my good days there are no cuts but a layer of dark dry scaly skin remains. It&#x27;s like an ugly protective barrier my body makes to protect my hands. It&#x27;s been like this for years. When this item arrived I decided to use it once a day before bedtime because it would stay on the longest due to no hand washing while I sleep and that way I was getting my money&#x27;s worth because this hand lotion is pricey to me. So the first night before bed I put it on my hands and there was a LOT of tingly burning for a few minutes. I dealt with it because again this stuff is not cheap and it is normal for glycolic acid to feel this way if you&#x27;re not use to it.  After the burning subsided my hands did look moisturized so I went to bed. The next morning I excitedly ran to the bathroom to look at my hands and when I saw them my first thought was, \\&quot;Oh... Well I knew it was a long shot.\\&quot; There wasn&#x27;t much change. This being the first time I realized I needed to really lower my expectations. Then the second night before bed I used it again and again it burned but again I just dealt with it until the burning subsided a few minutes later. The next morning I didn&#x27;t bother to look at my hands. I dragged myself out of bed to have my first of the morning pee and when I sat down I happened to just glance at my hands. Then I did a double take. My next thought was, \\&quot;OH MY GOD! I must still have sleep in my eyes!\\&quot; I got off the toilet, washed and dried my hands (and my eyes) and looked again. My hands almost looked like they did before I ever had dermatitis. It had been years since my hands looked this good. My natural hand color is a yellowy tan. But with my scaly hands they became dark brown. But I was now looking at yellowy tan skin again. And it was SOFT and almost completely scale free! Not hard and dry! I couldnt&#x27; believe that in just 2 uses before bedtime it had almost completely erased what I had for YEARS! And I&#x27;ve tried many made-for-hands products. I ran to the other room to show my husband and I shoved my hands in his face and was yelling, \\&quot;LOOK! LOOK!\\&quot; and \\&quot;FEEL THEM! THEY&#x27;RE SO SOFT!\\&quot; He couldn&#x27;t believe it either. So, the third night I used it again and the third day it looked even better. It never got better than it looked the third day. That was the peak and the plateau but with constant use it remains the way it looked the third day. I have told such a long story because the dramatic change from night 2 to day 3 was incredible! I continue to use this product regularly. I use to have extrememly soft hands and though my hands are not quite pre-dermatitis quality it&#x27;s the closest I&#x27;ve ever come with any product. This product won&#x27;t work for everyone, but I hope my review helps, and I hope anyone who has dermatitis on the hands tries it because it helped me so much, and it is definitely worth giving it a shot.

    <li> I have very sensitive skin and also have mild Keratosis Pilaris on my upper arms and since using this stuff every day after my shower, I can honestly say that I notice a difference! I have never noticed a difference with anything I&#x27;ve tried. I also started using African Black Soap w/ Shea Butter at the same time. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s this lotion, the soap or a combination of both that has FINALLY cleared up my upper arms, but I&#x27;m betting this lotion has a lot to do with it. Will order more when I run out!</li>
    <li> Great lotion. Expensive but unusual, non-greasy and feels good on dry skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and love it :)</li>
    <li> The lotion plus the glycolic acid body wash keeps my skin, especially my arms,  free  of  KP bumps without costly, unpleasant prescription lotions.</li>
    <li> Within 5 days of starting to use this lotion on my upper body I see a drastic reduction of the little red bumps that have plagued the backs of my upper arms for 30+ years. Overall my skin is softer and smoother to the touch, and appears more youthful.  I think I still need something even strong for the backs of my hands, but over all I am extremely happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does sting a little when it first goes on after a shower, but so worth it.  There isn&#x27;t really any fragrance so it doesn&#x27;t compete with my perfume, and it absorbs quickly enough that I can apply it, put on my makeup in the morning and then get dressed without feeling like it&#x27;s rubbing off on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so impressed I started using it on my feet/legs this week....sandal weather is almost here!</li>
    <li> My skin has gotten smoother over time and softer too. Unfortunately, sometimes it stings a little when you put it on, but that is a small price to pay. I put it on my face too!   I will never use another lotion again.</li>
    <li> WIFE HAS SERIOUS SKIN (GENETIC) PROBLEM WHICH THIS PRODUCT HELPS (ONLY OTC PRODUCT) WISH WITH ALL OUR HEARTS THAT IT COULD BE BOUGHT IN LARGER AMOUNT AT A REDUCED PRICE.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Fast shipping. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great if you have skin that has some sun damage and is dry, helps to smooth things up.</li>
    <li> I have very thin, dry skin and this was recommended by my dermatologist.  It hasn&#x27;t cured my skin but it has made a huge difference. I use it twice a day and have seen a huge improvement.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my mother&#x27;s oncologist.  I have very sensitive skin, allergic to fragrances and preservatives. My skin is very, very dry. This lotion makes my skin so soft and I only use it once a day. It&#x27;s the only lotion I haven&#x27;t had an allergic reaction to and I noticed a difference in my skin tone in just a week.</li>
    <li> According to my daughter, who uses this cream, it is just fine.  It doesn&#x27;t smell very good in her words but seems to be smoothing the red rash.</li>
    <li> I buy this product regularly.  It used to be easy to find, but becoming less so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It repairs dry skin better than any product I have ever used, relieving itching almost immediately.  While it seems to dry like other lotions, the action is long lasting.  I will use it on my legs when they are very itchy, slathering it on heavily.  It may be weeks or more before I have a problem again.  The only negatives are that the product isn&#x27;t cheap, and the pumps aren&#x27;t durable, so I buy several bottles at a time so I always have a spare.</li>
    <li> This works great and even soothes rashes and itchy spots.  I use after I shower. I recommend it.  The face cream works great too.</li>
    <li> husband has scandanavian  skin that is damaged- his dermatologist recommended this and I was amazed first that he would use it and then really like the effects. It dries instantly</li>
    <li> Our dermatologist said to use this product.  I have been buying it from behind the counter at the drug store for years.  Much more convenient for it to be delivered to my door!  Just avoid getting too much sunshine on exposed areas where you applied this lotion.  You will burn quicker!</li>
    <li> This lotion goes on thin, and can have a tiny bit of a sting to it.  Not to worry!  This is the good news, it&#x27;s working.  This lotion clears up cracked, dry rough skin with continued use.  You start by using it once a day, and we make it night so we don&#x27;t wash it off before it&#x27;s had a chance to work.  You can use it twice a day if it&#x27;s not too irritating.  This is the first lotion we&#x27;ve found that actually, truly heals our hands.  We have a wood shop, so the oils are stripped from our skin daily.  The pump dispenser is perfect, and you&#x27;ll find that you only need the smallest amount, meaning 1 bottle will last a good long time.  So glad this lotion was recommended to us.  Hope you&#x27;ll give it a try.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Mom whose dermatologist prescribed it for the black and blue spots on her arms - she has senile purpura brought on by her meds.  She reports that her spots are disappearing and she is happy about this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion forever on my arms and it gets rid of the little bumps and makes your skin smooth.  It&#x27;s the best product on the market for this--originally recommended by my dermatologist.  The price at Amazon can&#x27;t be beat when you sign up to receive continuous shipments and get the discount.  I just need one every 6 months.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the positive reviews for this product- this is the worst lotion I have ever used (and I&#x27;ve used a LOT, I probably have 30 different bottle of lotion in my bathroom right now, all different brands). I have to wonder at all these positive reviews- the only thing I can guess is that they&#x27;re either fake or I got a bad batch or these people have never used glycolic lotions before.  1)As a glycolic lotion this stuff is not that great. I&#x27;ve used MUCH better gycolic lotions,that make your skin feel like silk after even one application. This stuff doesn&#x27;t have a high enough concentration of acid to do that. I don&#x27;t think the concentration in the lotion is equivalent to what they claim on the label. When I put it on my legs right after shaving in the shower I feel nothing, and most glycolic lotions usually tingle or even burn a bit on freshly shaved skin.  2)The smell is horrid and I am not sensitive to smells. I don&#x27;t mind products with medicinal smells or heavy fragrences. This lotion doesn&#x27;t smell that bad coming out of the bottle but after a minute on my skin it starts to smell like ammonia. It literally smells toxic, like a chemical. And I have not had issues with the smell of other glycolic lotions, so it&#x27;s not merely the presence of the acid that&#x27;s producing this noxious odor.  3) It doesn&#x27;t even make my skin feel very soft! I&#x27;m sure if you used this daily after 1-2 weeks the slight amount of glycolic acid would provide a softening effect, but with other glycolic lotion brands I can use the product 2 x&#x27;s a week and get the same effect.  I think this will be the first product that I will actually throw out- the smell and lack of results just makes it unpleasant to use.</li>
    <li> weak. I&#x27;ve had cheaper glycolic acid creams that work. I&#x27;ve had non-acid versions work better.</li>
    <li> Hand &amp; Body Lotion of Aqua Glycolic is hard to find. Terrific and came timely. Anyone trying this should try the Toner too!</li>
    <li> I bought this because of all the positive reviews but that must be because those people have good skin already. This did not work for me and I have been using this twice a day for over a month now.</li>
    <li> I carried the mail for nearly 25 years and was in the sun most of the day.  At the time, I didn&#x27;t worry about it, but now I can see the damage the sun has done to my skin.  I have never had great skin to begin with, but I have been using this after I saw a 74 year old gentleman purchasing it at a store.  He said his dermatologist had recommended it.  He looked pretty good for his age, and he too had been outdoors in his profession.  I use this on my hands, arms, legs, and neck.  It has mineral oil in it, but it is not greasy at all.  The brown spots on my hands have lightened considerably, and some have vanished.  My skin doesn&#x27;t look \\&quot;crepy\\&quot; like it used too.  My legs are not scaly.  I use a buff puff in the bath, and then apply this lotion at night and again in the morning.  It is comfortable and not at all sticky-feeling.  I don&#x27;t care how tight my budget is, I will buy it.</li>
    <li> I love Aqua Glycolic. A few years ago a dermatologist recommended it to me for the redness/bumps on my triceps. She said it was from a form of dry skin. This stuff works great when used twice daily to clear up my skin. It does take about a month or so to notice improvement, but it DOES work!</li>
    <li> A staple for great skin.</li>
    <li> it was a waste of money was better off going to walmart and purchasing s better lotion wouldnt buy again.. wonder if and glycolic body lotions are worth it</li>
    <li> Aqua Glycolic Hand And Body Lotion works the best of all the lotion or creams I have tried . Over the years I have tried at least 10 different kinds.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on the backs of my hands and arms to improve moderate sun damage and brown sports. I have definitely seen an improvement, but remember, short of a medical peel or other procedure, a lotion like this takes time (months) and will only do so much. If you have reasonable expectations, I think you will be pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I have been using this as a hand cream for about 10 years. It was recommended to me by a dermatologist when I asked him what I could use to eliminate/prevent brown spots. The few spots I already had are much lighter, if not completely gone and I have never devoloped any more.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this. I mainly use it for my hands because they can crack and dry due to a lot of hand washing. This makes your skin look and feel healthy. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy. It makes your skin feel nice and supple. I don&#x27;t really care for the smell, but that&#x27;s not why I bought it. I would definitely recommend that you try it.</li>
    <li> This is the most effective lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. I have a skin condition called icthyosis characterized by extremely flaky skin. Using a combination of the Aqua Glycolic Shampoo and Body Cleanser and the lotion has dramatically reduced the constant flakiness. There is no cure for icthyosis, but this lotion helps greatly with a major symptom.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years.  It makes your skin smooth and fresh.  I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so difficult to locate.</li>
    <li> Love! This is amazing, especially for 40+ sun damaged skin.</li>
    <li> I had used the lotion before (long time ago) and it worked wonders on my dry hands. I know it works that is why I ordered more....unable to find it in the stores in Colorado. The lotion works great on your feet for summer.</li>
    <li> This is a product I have used for years. It was recommended by a dermatalogist. I am 79 and people stop me to comment on my complection. I would highly recommend this product for face and chest area. It&#x27;s great as a hand lotion as well.</li>
    <li> I use this product every night when I get into bed on my feet and hands. Cuticles soft and skin on feet soft and smooth. I will use this forever.  Only complaint is that when I received the package some of the cream had escaped from the top of the bottle. Fortunately it is shipped in a plastic bag, so it didn&#x27;t get all over other items.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Recommended by my dermatologist to relieve dry skin.  It WORKS!!!</li>
    <li> Great lotion - love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, particularly for small spots you want to get rid of.</li>
    <li> While it&#x27;s pricey, this is the only lotion that works on my husband&#x27;s dry, itchy skin.  I try to buy it in bulk.</li>
    <li> I started noticing a difference in my skin within a couple of weeks of using this product. The dryness reduced considerably and my skin became much smoother.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and if you have dry, itchy skin in the fall and winter months, this product will do the trick!!!  It does not have a smell so it works for both women and men.  You only use the lotion once per day and you will get immediate healing results.  Love, love, love this product.  Was recommended to me by a Dermatologist and so thankful that he recommended it and that I tried it.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for many years and love it. However, this time when I opened the package it had burst sometime during transit and half of it was leaking out.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  It does enhance skin quality</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I wasn&#x27;t looking to make my skin &#x27;beautiful&#x27; but I needed something to prevent the &#x27;crusty crud&#x27; that appeared next to my nose and behind my ears. This stuff did it. I put it on my face and behind my ears after my shower each morning. (I have a full beard so I don&#x27;t shave.) It momentarily stings a little in the spots of concern but it is not bad and lasts only for couple of seconds.)&lt;br /&gt;And the &#x27;crusty crud&#x27; is gone (unless I don&#x27;t use it for a few days.)&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product on my legs for more years than I can say.  It is the only thing that I have used that works on my extra dry skin.  I would highly recommend it.  It is not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion for years, recommended by my dermatologist. I originally started using the wash and toner on my face, but found this lotion works miracles on dry heels that tend to crack (ouch). If I use this every night on my feet and hands, I don&#x27;t have the problem with callouses and my cuticles on my hands that used to crack, stay perfect. It&#x27;s worth every dime.</li>
    <li> I use this cream for mild psoriasis and it does the trick.  In fact, I use it for about everything.</li>
    <li> great product at the best available price</li>
    <li> Non greasy moisturizer great for night time.  Would also use for daytime under makeup if it had a sun block of SPF30 in it.</li>
    <li> My skin has dramatically changed for the better just after one bottle. Very pleased with results and lotion. Recommend this lotion to everyone</li>
    <li> This lotion is an excellent product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Lotion instructs you to stay out of the sun after application. My wife has an allergy to the sun and she felt using this lotion might only make it more dangerous to go out in the sun when necessary.</li>
    <li> I got this because my nails are so translucent.  They improved in less than a week! Other people said it helps age spots. I&#x27;m hoping i will see that too after longer use.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It was recommended by my dermatologist.  It is not easy to find in the drugstore but Amazon has it!  It does a great job of renewing your skin without irritation.  I used the hand and body on my face.</li>
    <li> Product was recommended by my dermatologist to help fade brown spots on my hands.  I am pleased with the results.  The spots are not gone but have faded significantly.</li>
    <li> recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I use this in the winter when my skin tends to dry out quite a bit.  It keeps my skin soft and I just love it. I can&#x27;t find it locally so I order it from Amazon.  Thanks for carrying this</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several years and really like this product. It&#x27;s great for dealing with very dry skin and scaly type patches.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this line several years ago but I didn&#x27;t try it until a couple of months ago. Despite years of frequent sun exposure, this product has made my skin smoother and softer than I can remember it being in a long time. It is a fraction of the price of similar products. I use this on my face as well as my body with equally good results. I also use the facial wash and have been pleased with that, too.</li>
    <li> I am brown skinned woman that has a few hyper pigmented spots on my skin, elbows, knees etc and wanted something that would gradually reduce these areas. I also have some old dark spots on my back from acne when I was a teenager. This product did alot to help greatly reduce these areas. My skin was left smooth and even toned. I also observed that some old white stretch marks didn&#x27;t look as pronounced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a great product, the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I think your skin gets accustom to it and it stops working after a while. To avoid this, I alternate it with shea butter ( natural stuff) a couple times a week.</li>
    <li> This cream has been wonderful for my legs.  It hydrates beautifully and my legs stay soft and supple all day.</li>
    <li> I kind of bought this product on a whim.  I was not happy, recently, when my son lifted up my hand and said, &amp;#34;Wow! Grammy&#x27;s hand!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved my late mother but her hands were not her best feature.  I have always put lotion on my hands but figured there wasn&#x27;t much more I could do.  Then I tried this lotion and it&#x27;s already making a difference..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without a doubt, the dry spot on my elbow, which developed there due to my arthritis, has almost healed.  This is almost a miracle because I have tried everything I could think of on that.  Occasionally it becomes a scab and it&#x27;s not how it looks but the fact that I fear it might become a skin ulcer that has troubled me. It&#x27;s practically healed.  Even my husband, the original doubting Thomas, had to admit it was very effective, and started to use it on the dry skin on his legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lovely sun spots on my hands are fading, I swear.  Maybe it&#x27;s my imagination, but I don&#x27;t think so. With regular use, I hope that the only thing that makes my son look at me and think of my mother is the fact that I&#x27;m always talking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream has a very light scent that fades.  It isn&#x27;t greasy but if you have an animal, you&#x27;d want to use it the last thing at night, after you&#x27;ve petted him, because the Glyco Acid leaves a very bitter taste on your hands.  I don&#x27;t think my cats would be happy if I petted them right after using it, since they always lick the area I&#x27;ve touched.  Best to wait about a half hour before touching them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, give it a try because I think it&#x27;s an extraordinary product and worth every cent you pay for it!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist suggested this product to me at a recent appointment. I have very dry skin and lots of skin damage on my fair skin from years of playing outside and living in sun filled climates like CA. and HI. After just 2 weeks I can see a marked difference in my skin. Some &amp;#34;sun spots&amp;#34; have already faded or disappeared all together and I can no longer see dry patchy skin on my legs and arms!&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that this product has acid in it and you do not want to use it after shaving. OUCH!</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin and have the razor bumps issue. All this product really does is help with the dead skin follicles which kind of shed off after use. I stuck with it routinely and still did not experience smooth skin results and disappearance of razor bumps which is what I was hoping for. It is kind of pricey and was really hoping for better results.</li>
    <li> Great for keratosis pilaris.  Took a while, but made mine go away.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product I&#x27;ve used for 30 years!  Shipped on time &amp; arrived as shown.</li>
    <li> This is great lotion. I&#x27;ve been using for years. So glad to find on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Past use; very dependable product that works.</li>
    <li> The container had been squashed, lotion came out and was all over the inside of the plastic bag that wrapped it. As a result, I lost much of the lotion.</li>
    <li> The lotion goes on super lightly and does not leave a sticky feeling behind. It doesn&#x27;t smell great, but it makes your skin feel amazing! I apply it after showering and night and when I wake up, my skin is silky smooth. My boyfriend has issues with acne on his back and once he started using this regularly, his back-ne went away. I got this to put on the little bumps on my arm (keratosis pilaris) and it WORKS! I tried Lac hydrin/AMlactin etc etc but I didn&#x27;t like how it felt and it didn&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
    <li> I have used this on my face for many years.  I&#x27;m 63 years old and my face has very smooth skin.  I also use it on my cuticles and it helps with dryness.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion for its softening effects. It is on the thinner side, and feels watery (it is called AQUA glycolic). I have been using it on my legs because that is were I feel I need the exfoliating and softening effect of the lotion. I like that it dries quickly and also that it does not have much of a scent at all.</li>
    <li> This lotion is disappointing. I love the generic 12% ammonium lactate lotion Amazon sells. It is far superior to this brand name at any cost. I only wish it were in the pump because I do like the way this dispenses. Aqua Glycolic does not treat my keratosis pilaris like the generic does.</li>
    <li> I have to say that this is the best most reasonably priced product for sun (or age) spots!  I use the hand and body lotion on my face morning and night and in no time at all, I&#x27;ve seen remarkable difference!  My entire family of sisters (and my mother) now use this too!</li>
    <li> This lotion was recommended by a dermatologist, and I had hoped it would prove to be good for keratosis.  I am not sure it performs as expected.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic hand and body lotion, but I was under the impression from its product description, and from some of the blatantly false reviews, that this will, over time, have a peeling effect.  I&#x27;ve been using it religiously for months now (twice daily), and it absolutely does not, and will not, have a peeling effect.  There are other products out there that will, but most likely not in a lotion, more along the lines of a targeted peeling product.  Still, it&#x27;s a great, non-greasy, unscented, fast-absorbing moisturizer that I use on my feet, hands, and forearms.  Definitely has a notable softening effect over time, just not heavy-duty enough to blast away callouses or peel off yucky thickened skin on the back of your heels.  Way better than drugstore products, and way cheaper than department store cosmetic counter products (and I particularly like the TRULY unscented, non-greasy part.)</li>
    <li> I realized I&#x27;ve been using these Aqua Glycolic products (body lotion, face cream) for probably 15 years or more and never reviewed them.  I have mild ichthyosis (dry thickening of the skin that makes it not turn to dust and shed correctly, left unattended can crack).  My dermatologist a long time ago carried other products by this manufacturer.  I found these and have been using ever since.  I need the alpha hydroxy to help the skin break up like it&#x27;s supposed to, but everything else I&#x27;ve tried including prescription lac hydrin leaves me feeling wet and clammy.  These don&#x27;t.  As with any of these lotions containing an acid, it can sting for a few seconds (especially the face cream as my face gets a little raw sometimes from scrubbing), and you need to be more diligent in using sunscreen as you will burn quicker.  And my dermatologist said it helps with wrinkles over the long run, a nice side effect.</li>
    <li> Best exfoliator ever.</li>
    <li> THIS LOTION IS GREAT AND I WOULD LIKE TO PLACE AN ORDER FOR 2 MORE BOTTLES,  I HAVE AN ACCOUNT WITH EBAY,. PLEASE NOTIFY ME OF THE COST OF THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> The actual lotion is great, but the bottle got busted during shipping and was everywhere, and then the pump wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product many years ago.  I finally ran out of my supply and I couldn&#x27;t find it in local stores.  So, voilla&#x27; Amazon to the rescue.  This product really works so you don&#x27;t have dry scaly skin.</li>
    <li> Has to many chemicals for me.  I threw it out.</li>
    <li> If the strength or percentage of glycolic, lactic or AHA in a lotion such as the Aqua Glycolic Hand &amp; Body Lotion is sufficiently strong you can say goodbye forever to rough hands, unsightly painful crusty cuticles, rough heels on your feet................etc.  I have used such for many years buying initially from a dermatologist and online thereafter. I hoped this would work as well but it does almost nothing relative to a stronger solution. I can feel by slight sting and I can smell this is the same essential product as I previously used but ineffective because of it strength or percentage of AHA is too week to have any effect on say cuticles even with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I thought I&#x27;ll just add a small amount of AHA on my own bought elsewhere at Amazon (like in glycolic or lactic peels) to increase the strength.  I am certain it will work.  I&#x27;ll soon find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile this lotion as it is is far too weak.  I gave it 3 stars only in hope if I increase the strength by the method herein described it might well prove to be a very good base.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product....and am anxious to see how it works.  I love the face cream and hope it works as well.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer.  Have used it successfully for several years now.</li>
    <li> A dermotologist told my mother 30 years ago to use this lotion.  I am now 65 and I&#x27;m using it for my neck and chest - it seems to prevent those nasty little skin tabs and skin discolorations that are such a fun part of getting older.  When compared to my friends, I think it has kept my skin smooth and blemish free.  Don&#x27;t have to feel like I need a turtleneck all the time!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Used and recommended by Dermatalogist .  Great for aging skin.  Great for elbows necks feet whole body. Don&#x27;t forget the ears</li>
    <li> This product is awesome (great exfoliant), and contains as much glycolic acid, or more, than any of the leading products.  I&#x27;ve used this item for many/many years, as it was first recommended by my dermatologist.  Kaiser used to sell it, but when they stopped, I was lucky to find it online @Amazon!  As it was initally recommended for my face (yes, even if it says hand/body lotion), I always top it with a good spf moisterizer, and I would suggest that you do, as well.  Using this product has been part of my daily regimen for a very long time!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome for the price. I use the body lotion on my face because it has a higher glycolic content. It has approximately 15 percent glycolic acid and is ph balanced. Your average glycolic peel is 20 to 40 percent.  You can work up to using this every day instead of having massive peeling from an office procedure all at once.</li>
    <li> This has been a staple skin care product of mine for years. It&#x27;s sometimes hard to find, but I see you can order it thru Amazon now. Leaves your skin smooth and silky without a greasy feeling plus, no it has no fragrance to interfere with your perfume. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended that I get this, and I really like getting it with the Amazon subscription service that makes it so convenient that I don&#x27;t run out. It really helps to bring back rough, dry skin to smoothness if used regularly.</li>
    <li> Love the lotion, received it very fast.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> This lotion is very good at re hydrating your skin, but for me it leaves a greasy feeling on my hands.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a perfectly acceptable lotion but I thought it was supposed to be a higher percentage of glycolic acid. It&#x27;s nowhere near the 15% Glycoderma that I was trying to replace for my face - but it&#x27;s a great body lotion at this price.  I just have to keep searching.</li>
    <li> Please read my review for the whole line. Treat yourself. You&#x27;ll never go back to department store brands with the hype and touched up pictures. This is all you need.</li>
    <li> Great product for very dry skin. It soothes irritations also.  A little pricey but worth it.  Order online at CVS for best price.</li>
    <li> After a lifetime of searching for something to relieve cracked and bleeding hands, I finally found Neutrogena New Hands.  The high content of glycolic acid was the thing that healed my hands by exfoliating them first.  When that was discontinued, I discovered Aqua Glycolic Hand &amp; Body Lotion and love it even more.  Unlike New Hands, it is completely scent free and non greasy. And it works!  I&#x27;m not exaggerating when I say that I tried everything over the years with no success. Finding this product was a lifesaver for me because going back to painful cracked and bleeding hands just isn&#x27;t an option anymore.  I don&#x27;t use it on my body, but if it works this well on my hands, I can only imagine what the results would be on the rest of me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for probably at least 15 yrs ... on and off, as it&#x27;s hard to find at times.  I love it, but keep trying to find something else I like as much because the packaging is ridiculous!  The 6 oz pump is manufactured in a way that makes only about 4-5 oz of the product readily available, without opening up the pump and scooping it out manually.  As a hand and body lotion, that means the pump will only last about a week .. and I am always opening it up and shaking and scooping .. it&#x27;s totally frustrating!!!  It is the best lotion ever .. keeps my skin soft in super-dry winters, I use it everywhere with great results.  But the packaging is annoying enough to mean that I am constantly trying other products, running out, and not able to keep to a steady regime to get consistent results.  Bigger size that is appropriate to the hand and body application, and better pump, please!!!</li>
    <li> I used this product to help fight razor bumps. I also changed up my shaving habits and products so I am not saying 100% that this product cured shaving bumps, but they did go away for me. It does leave a bit of a burn if you use it right after shaving, and at first my face would be MORE red.. but that goes away within minutes. If you are looking for a shaving bump cure you really need to read more into technique, routine, and products. At the least, I do believe this product helped! I did not break out in acne using this either.</li>
    <li> I originally got a small sample at a Dermatologist&#x27;s office and after just one use I saw a difference.  It is great for getting feet ready for sandals season. Now, I use it twice a day for a few days then just once a day.  It absorbs quickly and I think it is the best.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a long time and it is very good for dry skin a dermatologist recommended it to me years ago. Just hard to find</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this product. It works so well that I&#x27;ve gotten rid of my other hand/body lotions and use only this. For as long as I can remember I have gotten really bad ingrown hairs every time I shave. I have pale skin and I hyperpigment really easily so it&#x27;s been a really frustrating thing to deal with. After trying lots of aftershave creams/gels/toners I came across something that said that Glycolic Acid was good for ingrowns and other hair related issues. After reading the reviews I decided to take a chance and get this and boy am I glad I did. Not only has it completely (and I do mean completely) solved my ingrown problem, my skin feels SO soft! I use this after I shave and on my hands/elbows daily and I feel a difference almost immediately after putting it on. It&#x27;s so moisturizing but I feel like there&#x27;s nothing on my skin. It&#x27;s great! I&#x27;ve been using it daily for 2 months now and I still have about half a bottle, which is just amazing - you really only need a little bit of this stuff. My favorite beauty product, hands down.</li>
    <li> WOW. This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. I use it on my hands and elbows before I go to bed. It really helps with winter dryness.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  My hands are very wrinkled and dry from years of pottery and gardening, and one application totally changed the texture on my hands.  They looked 20 years younger.  I&#x27;ve also been putting it on my neck, which is long and quite lovely when I was younger, but seems to be &#x27;melting&#x27;.  I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of improvement.</li>
    <li> Great for dry skin and I have used it for over 10 years. I am glad I found it to use.</li>
    <li> An amazing product! This is probably my favorite ever lotion - it stings a bit when you first use it, but that quickly wears off. It brightens skin tone and leaves my skin so soft. Works wonders on problem area like feet and elbows, too, and a bottle lasts a very long time (at least for me).  Highly recommended - delivery was quick and product as expected! Will definitely be ordering again!</li>
    <li> After trying a few well-known AHA lotions + creams, Aqua Glycolic has been the most effective. Unlike products like Strivectin, [[ASIN:B007FZR99I AmLactin Ultra Triple Action Alpha Hydroxy Acid Hydrating Body Cream 4.9 oz.]] or any other products from the Amlactin line which can be thick, smell a bit off, + leave a sticky residue, Aqua Glycolic is lightweight like a serum, unscented, + absorbs almost the instant it&#x27;s applied - almost to the point where you wonder if you put on enough b/c of how fast it disappears. I only tried Amlactin because a dermatologist recommended it for a burn discoloration that wouldn&#x27;t lighten up + ingrown hairs but after trying it for longer than I should have with no results, I was on a hunt for something better. Amlactin&#x27;s AHA percentage is at 12% of mostly ammonium lactate while Aqua Glycolic is 14% glycolic acid. After extensive research, [[ASIN:B0001EKYQA NeoStrata Lotion Plus AHA 15, 6.8 Fluid Ounce]] (15% AHA ) + Aqua Glycolic were the only two products I found that had higher AHA content among over-the-counter products but Aqua Glycolic was the only one readily available at a small/local mom + pop pharmacy (which only carries Rx + the best products/brands finely procured or requested by patrons). After one use of Aqua Glycolic, calluses, that wouldn&#x27;t go away w/treatment products like Dr. Scholl&#x27;s corn and/or callus removers, started to lift off w/in minutes of application + by the next day, skin where applied felt noticeably smoother + softer. If anything, it&#x27;s one of the few products I&#x27;d recommend trying over other products more readily available (note it&#x27;s also cheaper than Neostrata by ~ $0.80/oz).</li>
    <li> A little squirt goes a long way. I&#x27;m 25 but have the skin of a 14 year old with acne breakouts and this lotion smooths my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this item for a few weeks and as of now, I haven&#x27;t noticed a great change in my skin or ingrown hairs which is why I purchased the product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product but check your needs for moisterization or the conditions you might be treating.  I believe this product does (intentionally) make your skin more sensitive to sunlight.  Good for somethings but know why you are using it.</li>
    <li> A very useful product, with I believe 12% glycolic acid.  I use on my body and like that it diminishes age spots on my arms.  I use their moisturizer for my face and what a difference it has made!!!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product! It has the highest percentage of glycolic acid available without a prescription. (&amp;#34;14% glycolic compound&amp;#34; according to the manufacturer&#x27;s website www.aquaglycolic.com ). Use with care. Start out applying just a little a couple times a week. Do this for a month, gradually building up to daily use. Best to use at night so you can exfoliate in the morning.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years to alleviate my razor bumps on my neck.  I do not remember how I discovered this product, but it practically eliminated this issue that I have been fighting for years.  This product, along with the proper use of razors and exfoliating have kept my neck bump-free.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, not wonderful.</li>
    <li> Appears to soften my skin but need to use it longer to see if it helps with the sun spots and thickening of the skin</li>
    <li> Excellent product for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Great product! It was recommended by my dermatologist to erase fine lines and has definitely helped.</li>
    <li> I am a fitness swimmer, 40 laps (2000 yds) per trip.  This lotion banishes the dryness in my skin from so much chlorine exposure.  I use  it on my face, hands and back.  It especially relieves itching on my back.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion along with the face cream!  Have been using them for years.  Keeps my skin super soft and helps with my wrinkles and minor acne.  My skin is even softer the my 7 year old daughter&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Like the way my skin feels with this lotion, I live in a hot and humid country and it is just great.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product. Does everything they say.  We have used this product for over 10 years and it is the best product we have found for dry skin.</li>
    <li> It really works. After two applications...skin like velvet.</li>
    <li> This product was ordered for me by the doctor. This is a repeat purchase and works wonderfully.  Recieved from Amazon very fast and would purchase again when needed</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion to help eliminate shaving bumps under my arms and on my bikini line. I have noticed a marked improvement. I use the lotion immediately after shaving and then apply twice a day on the bikini line (morning and night). Still some bumps but much better. I would recommend trying this product.</li>
    <li> This product is a true 5 Star rating. It was DR recommended and is a real bargain price wise on Amazon. My husband has super sensitive skin &amp; this is the only lotion he can use.</li>
    <li> This product is a great moisturizer and the alpha hydroxy acid exfoliates dead skin to allow moisture to penetrate deeper into the skin.</li>
    <li> I use this on my face and it&#x27;s wonderful.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey to use as a body lotion but I may try it to see if it helps the barnacles now growing on my aging arm skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years.  I think it helps with removing the skin blemishes on my face, neck and chest.</li>
    <li> I find it an exellent cream for arms and legs.  Like the face cream I do not use it every day - it is not necessary.</li>
