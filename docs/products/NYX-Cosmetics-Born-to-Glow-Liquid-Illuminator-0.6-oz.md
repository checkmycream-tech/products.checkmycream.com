      <li>without the micca this product could be excellent, but it&#x27;s too sparkly.</li>

      <li>I was surprised to find that the best illuminator I&#x27;ve ever tried would be by an affordable cosmetics company like NYX.</li>
      <li>This product is smooth and gorgeous.</li>
      <li>I think with good application technique you can get a good effect with this, but powder is much easier.</li>

      <li>puts a nice fresh shine to my face.</li>
      <li>Shipping was really quick!</li>
      <li>Bought this with more of a shiny product in mind, and while it is very pretty</li>
      <li>Great light weight facial illuminator</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and has a beautiful, subtle way of catching the light without looking oily.</li>
      <li>just right!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok for highlighting but not for putting on your whole face.</li>
      <li>I feel that the product dries up too quickly when I try to apply it to my cheekbones and it&#x27;s quite glittery which I&#x27;m not fond of.</li>
      <li>Very pretty.</li>
      <li>I use this over my foundation around my eyes - it does not take much at all, received product very quickly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this product is pretty good when applied properly.  </li>
      <li>exactly what I wanted, thank you!</li>
      <li>Love the natural glow it give me on my face.</li>
      <li>Worth the price</li>
      <li>It was worth it.</li>
      <li>It s very nice for my pale skin.</li>
      <li>I only rated 3 stars because it doesn&#x27;t stay shiny all day which is okay... but its definitely pretty and does the job!</li>
      <li>I mix it with the NYX &amp;#34;Gleam&amp;#34; illuminator, and that seems to work pretty well.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to truly gauge the staying power of this product and while I do like it, especially for summer.</li>
      <li>Glad I bought it cheap and didn&#x27;t waste too much money though.</li>
      <li>I was really hoping to have a positive encounter with this product.</li>
      <li>I feel like I&#x27;m getting ready to go out for the night instead of</li>
      <li>, I was really looking forward to using it.</li>
      <li>I was really looking forward to this product, but it&#x27;s taken quite a bit of practice to figure out how to use it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very sparkly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t take many uses to fully empty the bottle.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this (for people with fair skin, at least).</li>
      <li>It makes my foundation break down and look s***ty when I apply it on top of my foundation</li>
      <li>Im not sure why this product got such good reviews, After applying it i really didnt notice any difference.  </li>
      <li>It is highly shimmery so if you like that this is for you.</li>
      <li>I expected it to just be a light illuminator with some sheen, but if you apply it directly it will look like you have glitter on your face!</li>
      <li>Since I purchased it from Ebay, I was a bit worried that I got ripped off since they said it was brand new</li>
      <li>First off, I thought that I had a used bottle because it seemed pretty empty</li>
      <li>It is different then I expected, but works fine.</li>
      <li>but I should have listen to the other reviews as far as how super sparkly it is.</li>
      <li>This stuff has WAY too much glitter to it, definitely not a product to be used by itself!  </li>
      <li>but apparently, that is what a new bottle contains.</li>
      <li>I tried putting a bit on my finger and dabbing across the top of my cheekbones, and it was not at ALL subtle, nor did it blend well with the rest of my makeup.  </li>
      <li>I have dry, sensitive skin, but I really wanted to try out a highlighter/illuminator.</li>
      <li>I personally enjoy a shimmering look during the summer when I&#x27;m tan and leave the house with little to no makeup on, this is pretty to add for a little pop.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s very watery and removes my wet foundation from my face, then if you use a lot of it</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> puts a nice fresh shine to my face.</li>
    <li> Too shiny/metallic for me.</li>
    <li> As the previous person said, you are buying like half air with this product. Since I purchased it from Ebay, I was a bit worried that I got ripped off since they said it was brand new but apparently, that is what a new bottle contains. Not only that, I was immediately disappointed that it was just sparkles and little/ no pigmentation on my skin. Granted that my skin is difficult by nature since I have a yellow undertone and I have really bad dark circles- it looks bad even on my forehead. For now, I&#x27;m just going to use it over and maybe under my blush if I want to sparkle. Glad I bought it cheap and didn&#x27;t waste too much money though. I was really hoping to have a positive encounter with this product.</li>
    <li> Worth the price but I should have listen to the other reviews as far as how super sparkly it is. Shipping was really quick!</li>
    <li> Grate stuff...,gives you that glow for an inexpensive price.NYX has came along way of improving their line!!!</li>
    <li> ThIs product is just okay, it leaves a shine but it&#x27;s very watery and removes my wet foundation from my face, then if you use a lot of it it will just leave a white streak of shimmer on your face. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> It does nothing close to make my skin glow but cakey and shimmery. Imagine a very dry face with shimmer all over it.......</li>
    <li> Everything I expected, a little to heavy for my taste anyways</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok for highlighting but not for putting on your whole face. I wish it wasn&#x27;t sparkly and just glow-y.</li>
    <li> This is the brand that the &amp;#34;Lady Boys&amp;#34; on Ru Pauls Drag Race use.... Loved..loved...loved...loved it. It was worth it.</li>
    <li> Great liquid highlighter for the price</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to truly gauge the staying power of this product and while I do like it, especially for summer. I can see why it might not be for everyone. There&#x27;s definitely a lot of shimmer in the liquid itself that is almost like applying glitter to the face. I personally enjoy a shimmering look during the summer when I&#x27;m tan and leave the house with little to no makeup on, this is pretty to add for a little pop.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS!!! Mix with your foundation of gently dab onto your face and it will give you the perfect sparkle!!!</li>
    <li> It is different then I expected, but works fine. I kind of feel like this was used in the movie Twilight because there are a LOT of sparkles in this product. But its still good.</li>
    <li> More sparkle than highlight</li>
    <li> Love the natural glow it give me on my face. It&#x27;s amazing. I defensively will spread the word to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> It glides beautifully, silky and great color, but the sparkly glitter ruins everything! without the micca this product could be excellent, but it&#x27;s too sparkly. It looks like makeup for little girls.&lt;br /&gt;So before you buy it keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;Dissapointed.</li>
    <li> love this stuff...so do the friends I&#x27;ve given it to. brightens my face (and my friends), but not too sparkly. just right!</li>
    <li> The color is nice, the texture is also very nice, but for me the product is unusably sparkly. Glittery, almost. My husband said &amp;#34;My Little Pony&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I carefully read the reviews before purchasing, and I saw that some reviewers thought it was too sparkly, some didn&#x27;t. The price was low enough for me to try it for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too bad, I was really looking forward to using it.</li>
    <li> This product is smooth and gorgeous. Looks great on your face and gives you the most perfect and natural glow. I will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to this product, but it&#x27;s taken quite a bit of practice to figure out how to use it properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It definitely catches the light!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: You have to use this EXTREMELY sparingly.  I tried putting a bit on my finger and dabbing across the top of my cheekbones, and it was not at ALL subtle, nor did it blend well with the rest of my makeup.  I had to wash my makeup off and start over.  Use only the tiniest amount.  It&#x27;s also very sparkly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is pretty good when applied properly.  I think with good application technique you can get a good effect with this, but powder is much easier.</li>
    <li> I have dry, sensitive skin, but I really wanted to try out a highlighter/illuminator. I purchased this one thinking that it would add a pearly, shimmery glow to my skin. While it does add shimmer, it also adds SPARKLE. I definitely wasn&#x27;t going for the Twilight-vampire look, but that&#x27;s what I got. It can also be a bit oily, so it doesn&#x27;t stay put. That being said, mixing a little bit of it with your moisturizer/foundation makes it much more of a subtle shimmer.</li>
    <li> Amazing coverage. Does not settle into pores or creases. Goes on light, feels invisible, and looks amazing!</li>
    <li> love this stuff! it brightens my face!</li>
    <li> The shimmer is great!!  I use this over my foundation around my eyes - it does not take much at all, received product very quickly.</li>
    <li> Awesome highlighter! Great affordable replacement for the Benefit High Beam</li>
    <li> Love it! I would recommend this (for people with fair skin, at least).</li>
    <li> I use this as a highlighter and it gives me just a hint of a healthy glow. I agree with the other reviewers...a little goes a long way. Do not glob this stuff on or you will sparkle.</li>
    <li> Very pretty. It is highly shimmery so if you like that this is for you. I love it</li>
    <li> Great light weight facial illuminator</li>
    <li> It is ok for the price. Skin looks kind of sparkly, not silky or glowy</li>
    <li> The size of my pinky small. But it works 💁</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure if I like this product. I feel that the product dries up too quickly when I try to apply it to my cheekbones and it&#x27;s quite glittery which I&#x27;m not fond of. It makes my foundation break down and look s***ty when I apply it on top of my foundation I think the best thing to do is mix a bit into your foundation if you like that all around glittery look.

    <li> Im not sure why this product got such good reviews, After applying it i really didnt notice any difference.  Definitely not worth the money or time spent returning.</li>

    <li> MY FAVORITE MAKEUP. NYX ROCXS. THIS ONE IS GREAT AND MAKES A GOOD ADDITION TO THE OTHER ONES I PURCHASED.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, I love it.  It s very nice for my pale skin.</li>
    <li> First off, I thought that I had a used bottle because it seemed pretty empty and it didn&#x27;t take many uses to fully empty the bottle.  Other than that it&#x27;s an ok illuminator, not the greatest.</li>
    <li> Bought this with more of a shiny product in mind, and while it is very pretty it&#x27;s more glittery then shiny I feel like I&#x27;m getting ready to go out for the night instead of going to work lol</li>
    <li> it was ok but not for me.thank you.</li>
    <li> Great love the color!</li>
    <li> exactly what I wanted, thank you!</li>
