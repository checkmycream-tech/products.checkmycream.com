      <li>Great buy.</li>
      <li>Have always loved the smell of Wings cologne.  </li>
      <li>He loved it.  </li>
      <li>Everyone that gives him a hug always tells him how good he smells when he&#x27;s wearing Wings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>How many women have said-you smell soooo good and what are you wearing???</li>
      <li>Nice price, too.</li>
      <li>Fine product, good price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really glad.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing.  </li>
      <li>My stepdad really enjoyed it and would purchase it again</li>
      <li>I Love This On My Husband.</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>I like for him to have more than one fragrance to wear.</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>scent has (probably) more alcohol which makes it more pungent then the original GIORGIO product.  </li>
      <li>… It has a strong alcohol undertone that changes the scent.</li>
      <li>Dad was pleased, I got it right.</li>
      <li>This is a fabulous fragrance that is clean and not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>I made the assumption one bottle contained a thicker, creamy after shave (as did the original Wings combo package).</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is NOT the original Wings cologne by Giorgio.</li>
      <li>He has tried some new ones here and there, but this one just smells so amazing on him.</li>
      <li>thats the first word that comes to mind Fresh and Clean.</li>
      <li>This fragrance is just fresh</li>
      <li>Several people have told the person wearing this cologne how nice it is.</li>
      <li>Price was right too.  </li>
      <li>The original scent was mild and longer lasting.</li>
      <li>Very pleasant, sexy, long lasting fragrance, but not overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>I was glad the a found it, I been looking for this cologne I have not seen it in the store in a long time.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Online much cheaper than in store.</li>
      <li>the price is unbeatable anywhere and this combo Wings after shave and cologne is the real deal.  </li>
      <li>My husband liked it for everyday use.</li>
      <li>Smells amazing, exactly what the description said it was, 3.4oz spray and after shave for less than what I have paid for 1.7oz bottles of Wings!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but it is definitely different.</li>
      <li>An educated guess is the company has a licensing agreement with Giorgio to make/distribute the cologne in a scent nearly (but not the same) to the original Wings cologne.</li>
      <li>I love this small and so does my girl.</li>
      <li>As far as the fragrance was concerned.</li>
      <li>I was pleased with my wings order, however on a subsequent order I am not pleased.  </li>
      <li>I usually get the smaller bottle from cheap places like Ross or TJMaxx for around $15.</li>
      <li>This fragrance also smells great on my husband and by ordering it on your website, it is much less expensive than in department stores.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My husband liked it for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I was glad the a found it, I been looking for this cologne I have not seen it in the store in a long time. I love this small and so does my girl.</li>
    <li> TWO STARS: It&#x27;s not what you may think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is NOT the original Wings cologne by Giorgio. The original scent was mild and longer lasting. It didn&#x27;t arrive ten seconds before you do and it didn&#x27;t leave two minutes after you&#x27;re gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scent has (probably) more alcohol which makes it more pungent then the original GIORGIO product.  An educated guess is the company has a licensing agreement with Giorgio to make/distribute the cologne in a scent nearly (but not the same) to the original Wings cologne. Packaging is similar BUT nowhere does it say GIORGIO (on the bottle or box it came in). It also doesn&#x27;t have the W or the word Wings on the bottle as does the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing.  I made the assumption one bottle contained a thicker, creamy after shave (as did the original Wings combo package). Both are liquid form - one in a spray bottle.</li>
    <li> Fine product, good price.</li>
    <li> I know it is a nice fragance, that´s why I decided to buy it, however the package interior wrapping was so poor that my spray got broken...</li>
    <li> Have always loved the smell of Wings cologne.  Lasts all day.  Have used Wings off and on for 10 years.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous fragrance that is clean and not overpowering.  My husband likes it, but it is hard to find.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product 5-6 times.  Bottomline:  the price is unbeatable anywhere and this combo Wings after shave and cologne is the real deal.  Why spend 3-4 times the price at the mall for the SAME thing?  This is a great buy, one of the best on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Have purchased this before.  Love it.  Nice price, too.</li>
    <li> G.B. well the name says it all. This fragrance is just fresh thats the first word that comes to mind Fresh and Clean.</li>
    <li> Beautiful scent for my husband.  He loved it.  Would definitely buy this product again.  Price was right too.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> This fragrance also smells great on my husband and by ordering it on your website, it is much less expensive than in department stores.  I like for him to have more than one fragrance to wear.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with my wings order, however on a subsequent order I am not pleased.  I ordered the bluetooth keyboard and a charge cord for my Galax Note 10.1 tablet. The tablet does not fit in the keyboard and the cord discharges my tablet. I will be returning these items.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for a Christmas gift.  Several people have told the person wearing this cologne how nice it is.</li>
    <li> Very pleasant, sexy, long lasting fragrance, but not overwhelming.  Have tried other colognes and always come back to Wings.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Hello I don&#x27;t know if you guys got my payment, the visa number does not end in 0054  ,. .</li>
    <li> Dad was pleased, I got it right.</li>
    <li> As far as the fragrance was concerned. The box was flimsy, not anything like what you would find in a department store.</li>
    <li> My husband has worn this cologne for years. He has tried some new ones here and there, but this one just smells so amazing on him. Everyone that gives him a hug always tells him how good he smells when he&#x27;s wearing Wings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This price is great for the amount. Usually you pay this much just for the cologne and extra for the after shake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of aftershave… It has a strong alcohol undertone that changes the scent. It&#x27;s not bad, but it is definitely different.</li>
    <li> Online much cheaper than in store. How many women have said-you smell soooo good and what are you wearing??? I want to buy it for my husband.</li>
    <li> only place I could order this for my son.  I&#x27;m really glad.</li>
    <li> I Love This On My Husband. Smells Great.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and was very great value for the money. My stepdad really enjoyed it and would purchase it again</li>
    <li> I love this. This was a Christmas present for my husband. He so loves this. I will purchase Wings by Giorgio again</li>
    <li> I like wings for men as a medium range fragrance for everyday use. I usually get the smaller bottle from cheap places like Ross or TJMaxx for around $15. This set was a bargain for $25 with the added aftershave and both are larger bottles.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, exactly what the description said it was, 3.4oz spray and after shave for less than what I have paid for 1.7oz bottles of Wings!! Very Satisfied!!</li>
    <li> item arrived before the scheduled date and was as advertised</li>
