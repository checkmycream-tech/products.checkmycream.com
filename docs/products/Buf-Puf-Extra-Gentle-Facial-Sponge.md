      <li>LOVE</li>

      <li>I love this Buf-Puf...</li>
      <li>and best of all they rinse super clear when you are finished cleansing.</li>
      <li>I purchased this after researching what would best help/prevent my flaky, dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Great for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>and It&#x27;s perfect for every other day exfoliation.</li>
      <li>easy to hold and use to scrub face.</li>
      <li>The sponge really does a nice, gentle job of exfoliation, but it gets used up pretty fast and given the cost, seems like not the greatest value.  </li>
      <li>it really is very gentle!!</li>
      <li>I used them for years and wish they were still available.</li>
      <li>The facial sponge is acceptable, but the Buf-Puf singles were much better as they had their own cleansing soap built in.</li>
      <li>Exfoliation is important in skin care, according to some articles I&#x27;ve read, and this little teardrop shaped puff is wonderful for seriously gentle exfoliation.</li>
      <li>Ok so I wanted a buffer I could use with my face cleanser that was suuper gentle</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find these locally here in Honolulu and was finally able to find em&#x27; here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>The extra gentle Buf-Puf is great for every day cleansing.  </li>
      <li>The product arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>The Extra Gentle is best for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Just the right amount of exfoliation.  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t mind replacing every 3 months, this is a very good choice for removing dead/rough cells from delicate skin!</li>
      <li>Very gentle on the skin.</li>
      <li>This extra gentle version is better for facial skin, exfoliates nicely.</li>
      <li>Had one of these before,love it, finally found it again and fell in love with it all over again</li>
      <li>well sure enough, it works.</li>
      <li>so they really do help keep your complexion fresh.</li>
      <li>Just know that this one IS Extra Gentle, so if one is looking for a really good exfoliator, this will be too soft.</li>
      <li>However, the price for a mild face cleaner/scrubber is a bit high considering</li>
      <li>I love the extra gentle one as it doesn&#x27;t irritate.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, the &#x27;roughness&#x27; is just right for my oily but sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>It is gentle</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;d like to keep your facial skin smooth, then you might also like this puf.</li>
      <li>but even I felt that this was too gentle.</li>
      <li>However, there isn&#x27;t much of anything comparable on the market, so I&#x27;ll probably buy it again.</li>
      <li>but if you press at all it is not so gentle.</li>
      <li>I have used Buf Puf for years and now that I am older I find I don&#x27;t need as much &amp;#34;sanding&amp;#34; as I used to, but I still want that deep down clean, so this fits the need nicely.</li>
      <li>do use other, more sturdier Buf Puf sponges and have been for years and do like the line.</li>
      <li>As I am now older, I want to be gentle with my skin.</li>
      <li>Even if it was previously tested on lab rabbits who now have shine free faces!</li>
      <li>If money is no object, it may be worth the price for this extra gentle version of Buf-Puf.</li>
      <li>Mind you, they don&#x27;t last long either, but the price is much more reasonable for a package of 12.</li>
      <li>I use Eucerin cleanser for sensitive skin, and then just gently use this buf puf.  </li>
      <li>They work well and are gentle on sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I remember from my early years, but much softer.  </li>
      <li>They are fine for my skin, especially for removing make-up as long as I take time to use them really gently on my face.</li>
      <li>The only thing this pad is good for is cleaning soap scum off of your tub.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good facial sponge...soft enough for your face, but it just doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Being the first time that I have used one of these, I am not sure how long they \\&quot;normally\\&quot; last, but I have gotten a good two and weeks of daily use out of mine, before noticing that it was beginning to lose it&#x27;s structure a bit.</li>
      <li>Light little circles with a liquid cleanser was just what my skin needed.</li>
      <li>I love these hard to find items.  </li>
      <li>The Buf Puf Extra Gentle is just what I needed.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 71 years old and look like I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I got the sensitive skin texture</li>
      <li>I bought regular buff sponges from Target even though they are rougher that the Extra Gentle Buf-Puf.</li>
      <li>; generally means &amp;#34;FREE&amp;#34;!</li>
      <li>Too rough scrubbing really irritates my skin, no matter what I use.  </li>
      <li>It does begin to pill slightly after a couple  months but lasts a good long time as long as you carefully rinse it and prop it up to dry out.</li>
      <li>It is just enough exfoliation to get the dead cells off, but not so much that it irritates my sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I squeeze a little facial cleanser onto my Buf-Puf and gently move it around in circles.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve had these before, and thought I would try them again as I need to exfoliate my oily skin often, but the pad breaks down rather quickly needing replacement after a few months. Otherwise, the &#x27;roughness&#x27; is just right for my oily but sensitive skin! If you don&#x27;t mind replacing every 3 months, this is a very good choice for removing dead/rough cells from delicate skin!</li>
    <li> I love these hard to find items.  They work well and are gentle on sensitive skin.  Don&#x27;t throw them away when you need to replace them.  I use them to clean hard to reach areas in the shower and other places.  Very happy to find a reasonable source for these.</li>
    <li> I have been using this in conjunction with acne face wash for about a month and I believe this sponge seriously helps in clearing up blemishes and acne. My face looks almost completely clear lately and it does also feel softer than usual. Buy it right now whether you have blemishes or not because this sponge is a great exfoliator for your skin!</li>
    <li> Exfoliation is important in skin care, according to some articles I&#x27;ve read, and this little teardrop shaped puff is wonderful for seriously gentle exfoliation. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I tried some of the less expensive face puffs but found them to be way too rough on facial skin.  The Buf Puf Extra Gentle is just what I needed.  If you&#x27;d like to keep your facial skin smooth, then you might also like this puf. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Here are a few hints: &lt;br /&gt;-Avoid \\&quot;scrubbing\\&quot; your skin, even with this puf.  Too rough scrubbing really irritates my skin, no matter what I use.  Light little circles with a liquid cleanser was just what my skin needed. &lt;br /&gt;-Rinse the puf thoroughly.  Shake out the water.  Try to avoid too vigorous squeezing; that flattens the sponge prematurely. &lt;br /&gt;-Allow the sponge to dry; stand it up so that air can circulate around it.  My buf puf sponges seem to last a long time when I remember to rinse and dry them. &lt;br /&gt;I have NO commercial interests in this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after researching what would best help/prevent my flaky, dry skin.  The extra gentle Buf-Puf is great for every day cleansing.  I use a dab of cleanser, wet the puff and make little circles over my skin.  It is just enough exfoliation to get the dead cells off, but not so much that it irritates my sensitive skin.

    <li> Ok so I wanted a buffer I could use with my face cleanser that was suuper gentle so I could use it every night with my face wash. It is gentle but if you press at all it is not so gentle. So just don&#x27;t over do it with the srcubbing. easy to hold and use to scrub face. TIP: You should only be exfoliating with this at night because exfoliating makes your skin a bit red. So make this your night time routine.</li>
    <li> Had one of these before,love it, finally found it again and fell in love with it all over again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years and won&#x27;t be without one in the shower.</li>
    <li> SHIPPED IN A TIMELY MATTER.  LOVE THIS PRODUCT THANK YOU.</li>
    <li> I have used Buf Puf for years and now that I am older I find I don&#x27;t need as much &amp;#34;sanding&amp;#34; as I used to, but I still want that deep down clean, so this fits the need nicely. You can buy cheaper types of a cleansing abrasive pad such as this, but it wont hold up as long as these do, They last! and best of all they rinse super clear when you are finished cleansing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years. I&#x27;m 71 years old and look like I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s so they really do help keep your complexion fresh.</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly. The pad itself was a very, very hard piece of nylon/polyester. I understand how to use all facial products, I read all instructions. I have never understood why companies put out such horrible products like these buf-puf pads. If you are looking to rub off your epidermis layer and expose all that is underneath, then this is for you. My face was on fire after using this pad. The only thing this pad is good for is cleaning soap scum off of your tub.</li>
    <li> I love this Buf-Puf...it really is very gentle!! The only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t last long--not at all. Mine lasted 2 weeks, and I feel it&#x27;s too expensive to replace the puf every couple of weeks. I bought regular buff sponges from Target even though they are rougher that the Extra Gentle Buf-Puf. They are fine for my skin, especially for removing make-up as long as I take time to use them really gently on my face. Mind you, they don&#x27;t last long either, but the price is much more reasonable for a package of 12. If money is no object, it may be worth the price for this extra gentle version of Buf-Puf. At least try it once and decide for yourself.</li>
    <li> I use this to rinse off my face wash and it exfoliates enough to make my skin feel cleaner and fresher than if I had not used it. I bought it because I have oily skin and wanted to get some of that grease off at the end of the day... well sure enough, it works. Just know that this one IS Extra Gentle, so if one is looking for a really good exfoliator, this will be too soft. It does exfoliate though, and not to the point that skin gets red and irritated, so that&#x27;s a plus...   I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using an exfoliating face wash though, since using this to wash it off would be enough.  All in all, I&#x27;ll never go back to washing my face without one!</li>
    <li> As I am now older, I want to be gentle with my skin. This seems to do the trick. I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> The regular version of these Pufs is way too rough, can&#x27;t imagine using them on anything but elbows and heels. This extra gentle version is better for facial skin, exfoliates nicely. I use it with Neutrogena Facial Bar, rinse it well, and air dry it on end on a soap tray between uses. It does begin to pill slightly after a couple  months but lasts a good long time as long as you carefully rinse it and prop it up to dry out. This is the most cost effective exfoliating treatment available. Too bad its only available online.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good facial sponge...soft enough for your face, but it just doesn&#x27;t last long. Too fragile and falls apart/shreds.&lt;br /&gt;I do use other, more sturdier Buf Puf sponges and have been for years and do like the line.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin but even I felt that this was too gentle. I wasn&#x27;t sure it was doing anything so I ended up scrubbing pretty hard. On the other hand, it really is &amp;#34;extra gentle&amp;#34; so maybe I just purchased the wrong intensity.</li>
    <li> My facial skin is quite sensitive, so I only use the Buf-Puf about twice a week, and that seems to be often enough to keep my face from breaking out, and also seems to help with the \\&quot;dirty pores\\&quot; situation. I squeeze a little facial cleanser onto my Buf-Puf and gently move it around in circles. I don&#x27;t apply any kind of skin freshener or astringent immediately afterwards to avoid stinging and redness.</li>
    <li> and is seriously over-priced.  The sponge really does a nice, gentle job of exfoliation, but it gets used up pretty fast and given the cost, seems like not the greatest value.  However, there isn&#x27;t much of anything comparable on the market, so I&#x27;ll probably buy it again. Sigh.</li>
    <li> After receiving this I realized I had had one of these for the problems with teenaged skin. Now it does a nice job exfoliating!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these as my go-to facial cleanser for years. The Extra Gentle is best for sensitive skin. There&#x27;s no need for facial masks or a cleanser with &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; when using these as they slough dead skin without abrasives.</li>
    <li> Great service and product.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made and awkward to use.</li>
    <li> Product as described. I&#x27;ve used these for years. They&#x27;re a Godsend with my oily skin! I haven&#x27;t been able to find these locally here in Honolulu and was finally able to find em&#x27; here on Amazon. Speedy shipping! Smooth transaction!  However, the price for a mild face cleaner/scrubber is a bit high considering it&#x27;s probably nothing more than peach colored fish tank filter cut in a tear drop shape! ha ha! Even if it was previously tested on lab rabbits who now have shine free faces! jkg!  ha ha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was outrageous! Considering it weighs what? A few grams?! :( But thats how AMAZON is! They always sneak in shipping and handling even if the vender you buy from is offering &amp;#34;free shipping&amp;#34;! BOO! Where I come from, &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; generally means &amp;#34;FREE&amp;#34;! but like the Godfather of consumerism Amazon must have their kick backs.</li>
    <li> Very gentle on the skin.</li>
    <li> Just like the Buf Pur I remember from my early years, but much softer.  I got the sensitive skin texture and It&#x27;s perfect for every other day exfoliation.</li>
    <li> The facial sponge is acceptable, but the Buf-Puf singles were much better as they had their own cleansing soap built in. I used them for years and wish they were still available.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin.  Just the right amount of exfoliation.  I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using it with a scrub too.  I use Eucerin cleanser for sensitive skin, and then just gently use this buf puf.  I love the extra gentle one as it doesn&#x27;t irritate.</li>
    <li> best buy for facial cleasning</li>
</ol>
