      <li>With the Vinylux topcoat, this polish dries fast and looks great!</li>
      <li>This is a great spring color and with the vinylux topcoat it lasts the full week.  </li>
      <li>far as the Vinylux itself, it works great and looks great.  </li>
      <li>So far, it is the best color that I have found in this line.  </li>
      <li>did not stay on more than 3 days</li>
      <li>keep in mind that to get the durable, 1 week wear, you must top it with the vinylux topcoat.</li>
      <li>However, this shade is much more orange than it appears.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is my favorite summer color.</li>
      <li>The color is more orange than the pic, but still worked with my skin tone</li>
      <li>I love nail polish and the CND brand - but I found that shellac was a pain to put on my fingers.</li>
      <li>So many compliments on this color and it lasts and lasts.</li>
      <li>Love this nail polish.</li>
      <li>Great wear for a good 5-7 days with minor wear showing on the edges.</li>
      <li>I have made sure that I followed the instructions for applying it by using the Scrubfresh to clean my nails and sealing it with the Vinylux topcoat sealer.</li>
      <li>I frequently polish my own nails with nice results but not so with this product.  </li>
      <li>Pretty color nice smooth texture.</li>
      <li>The nail polish lacquer is very easy to use, stays on well, and this color is really pretty.  </li>
      <li>Stays on a week but because you use no base coat it stains your nails.</li>
      <li>Vinylux polishes dry very quickly and this is a great value.</li>
      <li>The seller shipped it quickly and it came packaged well, so no complaints about the experience, just the color.</li>
      <li>Very pretty color of a pinky coral.</li>
      <li>I like these colors for toes during the summer months &amp; a very pretty color for nails too.</li>
      <li>I never fail to receive a compliment when I wear this color, Tropix!</li>
      <li>This one did last a full week when used with their top coat.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d use it again just because the color was pretty, but it wasn&#x27;t as miraculous as I had hoped.</li>
      <li>This is the first nail product I&#x27;ve used that stays on for a week without chipping.</li>
      <li>Pretty color.  </li>
      <li>and it really lasts!</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m fair skinned) and I got compliments on it from a few people!</li>
      <li>I like this brand of polish, it really stays on a week.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery &amp; packaged well.</li>
      <li>and I love the quality; it really does last a week, but even at the nail salon, they could not remove all of the red from my toes.  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend this product based upon my spouse.</li>
      <li>Used the color on bare nails, applied 2 coats with plenty of dry time, used the special top coat, but still got chipping within a few days.  </li>
      <li>Usually my nails chip by the second day, but this easily lasts for 5 as long as you use the top coat.  </li>
      <li>Seems like pretty standard nail polish.  </li>
      <li>I have bought at least 5 colors as well as the top coat.  </li>
      <li>I realize that they say that you don&#x27;t need a base coat, but I ALWAYS use a basecoat and this one works the best.</li>
      <li>It does last the full week without chipping (I also ordered and used the Vinylux topcoat) and it comes right off usually with regular nail polish remover.</li>
      <li>Wife really loves the color and so do I, and how long it stays on without chipping.</li>
      <li>As much as I love this polish and the Tropix coral tone, this particular color is really tough to remove which is why I&#x27;m giving it only 3 stars.  </li>
      <li>This polish really does last a long time.  </li>
      <li>While it didn&#x27;t last an entire week, it sure held up extremely well for at least 5 days.  </li>

    <li> What great nail polish.  Stays for 2 weeks.  No chipping.</li>
    <li> I love nail polish and the CND brand - but I found that shellac was a pain to put on my fingers. I prefer to change my polish weekly, so Shellac isn&#x27;t my best option. Great for my feet though :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite summer color. It is a jelly formula and a great coral color.

    <li> This polish really does last a long time.  Usually my nails chip by the second day, but this easily lasts for 5 as long as you use the top coat.  I have been wearing this color nonstop.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for these polishes they go on thin and are streaky.  I frequently polish my own nails with nice results but not so with this product.  Never again</li>
    <li> Wife really loves the color and so do I, and how long it stays on without chipping. Would highly recommend this product based upon my spouse.</li>
    <li> This is the only polish I&#x27;m buying from now on! I&#x27;ve never had a polish (except gel) last a full week without serious chips and the need for a touch-up after a few days. This one did last a full week when used with their top coat. Love!</li>
    <li> Best nail polish I have ever used.  While it didn&#x27;t last an entire week, it sure held up extremely well for at least 5 days.  I have bought at least 5 colors as well as the top coat.  I have thin, brittle nails and nothing works as well as this polish.  Buy this product, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> This is a great spring color and with the vinylux topcoat it lasts the full week.  Even strangers complimented me on my nails when I wore this!</li>
    <li> its the only nail enamel that last in my hands without the roughness to the nails of shelac</li>
    <li> Beautiful color, if a bit bright.  It lasted a week as advertized, used with recommended products, even on flaking nails!</li>
    <li> Billed as orange, it is not! It is a deep pink. I returned it. So beware color descriptions online. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Pretty color.  Seems like pretty standard nail polish.  Used the color on bare nails, applied 2 coats with plenty of dry time, used the special top coat, but still got chipping within a few days.  I&#x27;d use it again just because the color was pretty, but it wasn&#x27;t as miraculous as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Love this nail polish.</li>
    <li> 1.  DOESN&#x27;T LAST BUT 4 DAYS.&lt;br /&gt;2  COLOR LOOKS TO BE PINK ON COMPUTER, BUT TOO ORANGE IN REALITY OR WHEN APPLIED.</li>
    <li> Very pretty color of a pinky coral. I like these colors for toes during the summer months &amp; a very pretty color for nails too. Vinylux polishes dry very quickly and this is a great value. Fast delivery &amp; packaged well.</li>
    <li> I like this brand of polish, it really stays on a week. However, this shade is much more orange than it appears.</li>
    <li> As much as I love this polish and the Tropix coral tone, this particular color is really tough to remove which is why I&#x27;m giving it only 3 stars.  I have ordered a bunch of CND Vinylux polishes and I love the quality; it really does last a week, but even at the nail salon, they could not remove all of the red from my toes.  I haven&#x27;t had that experience with the other colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the Vinylux itself, it works great and looks great.

    <li> This is the first nail product I&#x27;ve used that stays on for a week without chipping. I am very happy with it !</li>
    <li> if you are looking for a coral pink color, this is it!!  keep in mind that to get the durable, 1 week wear, you must top it with the vinylux topcoat.</li>
    <li> Polish never lasts on my nails.  This lasted only 2 days.  I had hoed it would last longer before peeling off.</li>
    <li> did not stay on more than 3 days</li>
    <li> Great wear for a good 5-7 days with minor wear showing on the edges. The color is more orange than the pic, but still worked with my skin tone (I&#x27;m fair skinned) and I got compliments on it from a few people!</li>
    <li> Best polish EVER- Trust me it lasts</li>
    <li> Beautiful color and it really lasts!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t last a week for me, it starts to chip and flake after 3 days.</li>
    <li> I never fail to receive a compliment when I wear this color, Tropix! It&#x27;s bright, cheerful, and perfect for summer. My delivery was when stated and the product was intact. I remain a fan of this longer lasting since I use and wash my hands often.</li>
