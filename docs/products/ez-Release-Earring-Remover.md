      <li>It was amazing.</li>
      <li>I do think it&#x27;s a bit overpriced for being nothing but a little plastic gadget, but it had really good reviews and seemed like the best solution to the problem, so I bought it anyway.  </li>
      <li>Even my husband was able to get the earrings out of her ears.  </li>

      <li>You want to be confident and in control, not bumbling around.  </li>
      <li>We have to keep an eye out and not let her keep post earrings in for more than a day or two.</li>
      <li>I was able to remove it without her realizing it :).</li>
      <li>She is happily wearing a new pair of earrings!  </li>
      <li>It also took barely any pressure on the tool to get them off, it was incredible.  </li>
      <li>With this tool we were able to easily remove her earrings without tugging on her ear.  </li>
      <li>Did not hurt and was quick and easy!</li>
      <li>so I could clean them better to fix it, was painless</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how easily they came out.</li>
      <li>I looked around and found this product and now removing the earrings are easy.  </li>
      <li>, it was so easy.  </li>
      <li>Glad I found this, easy to use, painless and quick.</li>
      <li>and i was able to remove the earings quickly and easily.</li>
      <li>Gave the product as a gift and it was simple and easy and worked great for the price.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
      <li>Amazing starter earrings came off with no problem thanks to this product</li>
      <li>so it can&#x27;t push it free from the butterfly.</li>
      <li>This thing is a jewel, well worth the money (or more).  </li>
      <li>I had to use more strength than what is shown and it took a bit to get the right spot lined up just so with the earring post.  </li>
      <li>Quick, easy, painless.</li>
      <li>Got my starters out really quick and easily, and one of my ears was infected so, taking them off</li>
      <li>sure there&#x27;s an improvement left to make sure the plunger lines up better with the earring post,</li>
      <li>Well worth the money!</li>
      <li>Worth the money!</li>
      <li>The price on this item made me think twice, but after 2 weeks of trying to get them off and a bit too much stress coaxing my child to let me try \\&quot;one more time\\</li>
      <li>I had my 5-year-old daughter&#x27;s ears pierced with a gun at Sweet and Sassy.</li>
      <li>So, a quick Google search brought me to this product.</li>
      <li>if only they made the perfect gadget for getting those tiny backs ON too!</li>
      <li>It took me about 3 quick squeezes for each earring in order for them to come out.</li>
      <li>It was super traumatic</li>
      <li>almost anticlimactic how easy and fast it is to use.</li>
      <li>It worked exactly as it said it would!</li>
      <li>So glad I found this - lifesaver for helping my 10 year old take out her starter earrings.  </li>
      <li>Worth every penny, in my opinion.</li>
      <li>This was worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;Pro</li>
      <li>I feel it was worth the money b/c</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still worth its weight in gold.</li>
      <li>LUCKILY, I had ordered this gem to get her studs out from when she had first pierced her ears.</li>
      <li>You just have to get positioning right so that it works.</li>
      <li>just popped right off no pulling or tugging.</li>
      <li>Best money I have spent in a long time!</li>
      <li>This thing barely helped I mostly had to remove my piercing with my fingers</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d make sure to let it heal before attempting it again, but it was becoming an endless cycle and even after 6 months they weren&#x27;t healed correctly.  </li>
      <li>No pain whatsoever, works exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>we were having about changing her earings (for the first time....</li>
      <li>I thought my daughter was going to grow up and get married before I could ever change her starter earings.</li>
      <li>so well we all started screaming when the earring was out on the first try</li>
      <li>It broke when I used it for the first time when I received it.  </li>
      <li>With a few try&#x27;s this got them right off without any pain!!!!</li>
      <li>I was able to maneuver the back out enough to fit just one of the posts in, and it came out quickly and painlessly.</li>
      <li>Perhaps not for everyone but made my life easy it works exactly as it says it does got to give it five stars because it&#x27;s simple and does it&#x27;s job right</li>
      <li>The first earring popped off when I used this and the second earring wasn&#x27;t as easy</li>
      <li>And then we went to the second ear and that one took three tries--but again, just as easy.</li>
      <li>Then I came across this little tool on a message board of some kind.</li>
      <li>It took me a week after receiving it to convince my daughter to let me try it, but we were both happy that it lived up to the hype and managed to get out her tough starter studs without any pain.  </li>
      <li>Have lots of light even if you need to get someone else to hold a flashlight on the earring back.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very relieved to have found this product.</li>
      <li>When my youngest was ready for her starters to come out, we could not get them off.  </li>
      <li>The earring would end up coming out so fast that any dirt or build-up on the stud would rip through her ear along with it</li>
      <li>At 10 weeks, my 12-year-old daughter was ready to remove her starter earrings, but she couldn&#x27;t get the backs off.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>My daughter was worried it would hurt and thanks to her Auntie Linda distracting her</li>
      <li>, I was scared it would hurt and be really hard to get them out, but this remover made it super easy!</li>
      <li>took 1 second &amp; the backing pops right off - no pain!</li>
      <li>this thing worked very well and quick the back</li>
      <li>I was able to remove her earrings in less than a minute.</li>
      <li>so they are we&#x27;re very hard to get a good hold</li>

    <li> Got my starters out really quick and easily, and one of my ears was infected so, taking them off so I could clean them better to fix it, was painless, I was scared it would hurt and be really hard to get them out, but this remover made it super easy!</li>
    <li> SUPERB product! My 3 year old daughter&#x27;s starter earrings were impossible to get out (she&#x27;s had them in since she was about 6 months old), and my attempts at trying to get them out was only hurting her and making her cry. So, a quick Google search brought me to this product. It worked exactly as it said it would! Quick, easy, painless. It took me about 3 quick squeezes for each earring in order for them to come out. Now she can wear a new pair of earrings. If you&#x27;ve got stuck earrings, oo not hesitate to buy this product!</li>
    <li> I used this to remove the butterfly back earrings from my 2 year old when it was time. Those earrings where stuck on there after we got her ears pierced but these helped get them off nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> Wow!!!!I&#x27;ve been trying to get my 6yr old starter earrings off for days because her ears have been very irritated.  With a few try&#x27;s this got them right off without any pain!!!! I was panicking thinking I would never get them off.  It seemed as though they were glued on they wouldn&#x27;t budge!!  I&#x27;m so happy i found this !!!!&lt;br /&gt;Rated 4 stars only because I didn&#x27;t receive them in the 2 days as I paid for.</li>
    <li> Okay, best invention EVER! At 10 weeks, my 12-year-old daughter was ready to remove her starter earrings, but she couldn&#x27;t get the backs off. After 6 more weeks of tears and refusing to let me do it for her, we discovered this tool. Within 10 minutes of opening the package, we removed the backs with no pain, no tugging, and no tears. Thank you! I was starting to think she would start college with the same pair of starter earrings.</li>
    <li> Amazing starter earrings came off with no problem thanks to this product</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but the review stated otherwise and I purchased this and I can&#x27;t tell you how much I am loved this! It worked on the second try. I had unsuccessfully tried previously and my daughters ear would bleed trying to get out her starter earrings. I highly recommend this and she didn&#x27;t even feel me take the earrings out!</li>
    <li> This is amazing and fantastic.i had butterfly earring lock in in my skin its was painful and stuck deep inside skin.i could not remove it with my hand or any tool&lt;br /&gt;I bought ez remover I actually used drop of pepermint oil to home my ear and my friend lie me down on side ,my other friend hooded my ear she pulled earring I had 0 pain deep locked earring came off immediately&lt;br /&gt;I would give this 7 star if I could!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I only write online reviews for items that really WOW me, and this product deserves one!  My two daughters got their ears pierced on the same day - for various reasons we removed my oldest&#x27;s several weeks ago and had to use pliers to pull the backs off.  They came off, but it was not easy, it took effort.  When my youngest was ready for her starters to come out, we could not get them off.  Not even holding the backs with pliers!  Several family members all tried to remove them over a 2 week period, which of course ended in tears and sore earlobes despite being as gentle as we could.  My husband looked up ideas on how to make the earring back removal easier and found this item - I purchased it immediately.  It came today and within literally seconds the earring backs were off with ZERO pain.  It also took barely any pressure on the tool to get them off, it was incredible.  Seems simple, just taking an earring back off - what is the big deal right?  But when they are STUCK ON THERE and your child is upset and won&#x27;t let anyone continue to try to remove them, this is a lifesaver.  She is happily wearing a new pair of earrings!  THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> I got my ears pierced as an adult, and was really starting to regret the decision. Every time I tried to change out my earrings, it was an ordeal. I&#x27;d have to get my fiance to help, and it was just nervewracking. But then I bought this and the earrings came out in seconds, no pain at all. I&#x27;m very relieved to have found this product.</li>
    <li> This EZ-Release earring remover is great.  It is very simple to use and it really WORKS.  The advertisment does not exaggerate.  Our 10 year old had \\&quot;starter\\&quot; earrings and they would not budge and we tried for several days.  I bought this ez-release earring remover and once we got it we had those earrings out in less than a minute. Amazing.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely brilliant! After struggling for so long to remove both my daughters&#x27; earrings, that this gadget was a godsend!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write any reviews, but I just have to say that this little plastic tool is a life saver. Whoever created it is a genius! I had my 5-year-old daughter&#x27;s ears pierced with a gun at Sweet and Sassy. The time came (8 weeks later) to remove the first earrings, and she screamed in pain. The backings were on there for good. I went on the internet and tried researching ways to remove the backings. We did everything from icing the backs of the earrings to warming them up, you name it. Then I came across this little tool on a message board of some kind. Thank god I did. I thought she&#x27;d be wearing those starter earrings for the rest of her life. The tool took the backs of the earrings off in less than 2 seconds. It was amazing. This is a serious must-have for anyone who has little girls.</li>
    <li> This is a great item. My daughters earrings were very difficult to remove and my daughter was not having any of it. I looked around and found this product and now removing the earrings are easy.  Thank you for this product.</li>
    <li> My 5-year-old daughter had her ears pierced about 6 months before I bought this product.  We had left the starter studs in as long as recommended for healing, and then attempted to change them.  Because her starters were flat little flowers, it was tough for me to get any kind of grip on them to get them out, and the backs were really tight, so I had trouble every time.  The earring would end up coming out so fast that any dirt or build-up on the stud would rip through her ear along with it and the hole would bleed.  I&#x27;d make sure to let it heal before attempting it again, but it was becoming an endless cycle and even after 6 months they weren&#x27;t healed correctly.  Eventually she wouldn&#x27;t let me near her ears, even to look at them.  I didn&#x27;t know what else to do, so I searched online for \\&quot;how to change daughter&#x27;s earrings\\&quot; and this product came up in the search results.  I do think it&#x27;s a bit overpriced for being nothing but a little plastic gadget, but it had really good reviews and seemed like the best solution to the problem, so I bought it anyway.  It took me a week after receiving it to convince my daughter to let me try it, but we were both happy that it lived up to the hype and managed to get out her tough starter studs without any pain.  There was a little bit of a trick to getting the gadget to line up with the end of the stud, but once I had that figured out, it worked like a charm.  Now her ears have been able to truly heal and we&#x27;re able to change her earrings whenever she chooses.  It is a little pricey for what it is, but it works!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t take off my earrings for about 6 months! I tried everything and nothing worked.  Thankfully I found this and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It works wonderfully and is worth the buy.</li>
    <li> I had my starter earrings stuck in my ears for several weeks after they were due to be removed. I pulled on them every which way but that just resulted in itchiness and pain. After my little device came in the mail, it only took a few tries on each earring to get the stuck starters off! There was a little pinch but not nearly as much pain as I had when pulling on them. Also- make sure you&#x27;re squeezing until you hear a click, or else you aren&#x27;t squeezing hard enough!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a video showing this product in use.  I had to use more strength than what is shown and it took a bit to get the right spot lined up just so with the earring post.  Not the easiest task with a terrified 5 yr old who is anxious b/c of all the previous failed attempts to get the starter earrings out.  I still rate it highly b/c it&#x27;s the only thing that worked and it didn&#x27;t hurt her ear.  I feel it was worth the money b/c there was almost no other alternative.  Prying them out just wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
    <li> it really doesn&#x27;t do the job as the part that is meant to push the post of the earing isn&#x27;t big enough so it can&#x27;t push it free from the butterfly. Instead use some fine needle thin plyers and widen the butterfly and it slips off</li>
    <li> This was a lifesaver for getting my daughter&#x27;s starter earring backs off. She had picked a style the was flat on the front, so they are we&#x27;re very hard to get a good hold on.&lt;br /&gt;This gadget even gave me the confidence to take the backs for cleaning her ears, even though it was too soon to let the studs slide out. I knew I had perfect control and could do it.&lt;br /&gt;Now if only they made the perfect gadget for getting those tiny backs ON too!</li>
    <li> This was the best thing! Did not hurt and was quick and easy! I recommend this to anyone that has a problem with getting their earring off.</li>
    <li> This was worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;Pro-tip: practice on a loose earring a few times before you take it to your child&#x27;s ear.  Have lots of light even if you need to get someone else to hold a flashlight on the earring back.  You want to be confident and in control, not bumbling around.  &amp;#34;Failing to prepare is preparing to fail.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s an improvement left to make sure the plunger lines up better with the earring post, but it&#x27;s still worth its weight in gold.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t reviewed this before! This device saved my daughter from a trip to the emergency room! For some reason her earlobes like to become &amp;#34;one&amp;#34; with whatever earrings she uses. We have to keep an eye out and not let her keep post earrings in for more than a day or two. However, before discovering this, her earring backs had become completely covered with skin. She said, &amp;#34;I think I lost my earring backs.&amp;#34; I could tell by looking at it that it was embedded. LUCKILY, I had ordered this gem to get her studs out from when she had first pierced her ears. I was able to maneuver the back out enough to fit just one of the posts in, and it came out quickly and painlessly. I was so grateful that I told myself I was immediately going to review this item. That was a year ago. Better late then never! Get this device!!!</li>
    <li> I had a starter earring stuck in my upper ear for a long time ( my cartilage was pierced with a gun)and my mom used this to remove the post. Glad I found this, easy to use, painless and quick.</li>
    <li> I was worried when I couldn&#x27;t get my starter earrings out, didn&#x27;t want to have to go back to my piercer and ask them to remove them for me. Ordered this, and got them off on the second try. You just have to get positioning right so that it works. Much easier than all the pulling I did on the backs trying to get them off a few weeks ago (:</li>
    <li> This is so amazing.  I purchased this out of desperation as I could not remove my daughters earrings and she was freaking out everytime I tried.  It was on so tight I thought I was going to have to get pliers.  I went online to see if I could find any tips on how to remove and this popped up as an advertisement.  I watched the video and thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt and all the other reviewers swore by it.  So as soon as I got it we tried it on her stuck earrings and with one squeeze they came out with ease. Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> The product did not make the process &amp;#34;EZ&amp;#34;. i actually struggle every time i take out of earring, when the prongs get stuck in my eating back.</li>
    <li> Perhaps not for everyone but made my life easy it works exactly as it says it does got to give it five stars because it&#x27;s simple and does it&#x27;s job right</li>
    <li> I like this product because all you have to do it poke it through, push it, and it&#x27;s out! I would recommend this product to anyone who has pierced ears and is scared to take them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maddie - 6 years old</li>
    <li> This tool did not help me. The instuctions were unclear. An actual picture would have helped.  I feel I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> It works a lot easier than I thought it would.  I always have trouble taking out my stud earrings, and having three on each ear, it was becoming quite a hassle.  With this earring remover, the back pops right off, no pain, no struggle with the sharp edges, attach it to the back of the earring and wa-la!  earring removed.</li>
    <li> I just got my ears pierced and when I went to take out my starter earrings the backs were on so tight I was worried I was going to tear the holes that had just healed!  I was terrified actually so I ended up ordering this little gadget.  I love it, it was so easy.  I don&#x27;t know how it works it just does.  The first earring popped off when I used this and the second earring wasn&#x27;t as easy but this thing loosened it up enough so I could get it off with my fingers.  You&#x27;ll be glad you ordered it!</li>
    <li> I thought my daughter was going to grow up and get married before I could ever change her starter earings. This worked so well we all started screaming when the earring was out on the first try and she didn&#x27;t even feel it. And then we went to the second ear and that one took three tries--but again, just as easy. They should sell this gadget wherever you get your ears pierced. I never would have known about it had I not searched about what to do if I can&#x27;t get my daughter&#x27;s starter earings out and some wonderful soul hadn&#x27;t mentioned this...</li>
    <li> I used it on my own and it took a few tries on each ear but there was NO pain! I&#x27;m so happy to have them removed. :-)</li>
    <li> Love this is worked the 1st time perfectly. I had my infant daughters ears priced but with her ears being so little it was very hard to get the starter earrings off. I was super anxious that would hurt her or split the hole having to pull so hard to get the starter locking back earring posts out. this thing worked very well and quick the back just popped right off no pulling or tugging. Buy this!</li>
    <li> I could not could not could not get the starters earrings off my daughter.  She had them in for almost a year as a result.  With this little gizmo...pop...one off and then the other.  I have used it since then as well when a backing is a little hard to remove but for starter earrings this is a MUST HAVE!</li>
    <li> My daughter (6 yr old) had her ears pierced and I could not remove her starter earrings! I found this online and read the reviews and decided to purchase it and I&#x27;m so thankful I did! I was able to remove her earrings in less than a minute. I don&#x27;t know what I would have done without this! My daughter was worried it would hurt and thanks to her Auntie Linda distracting her I was able to remove it without her realizing it :).</li>
    <li> I got this after getting my second hole re-pierced after remembering the tugging and pulling the first time around, which left my ear as sore and bruised as the day I got them done.  This thing is a jewel, well worth the money (or more).  No pain whatsoever, works exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> Worth the money! I was afraid to take my second hole piercings out because the backs are SO tight on piercing earrings that I was worried I&#x27;d rip the holes or make myself bleed! This little device made it SO simple and fast. I couldn&#x27;t believe how easily they came out. Completely 100% painless. Would definitely recommend to anyone ready to change earrings from those tricky piercing earrings.</li>
    <li> I was desperate to get starter earrings off my 5 year old.  She was insistent on me NOT touching her ears again.  The price on this item made me think twice, but after 2 weeks of trying to get them off and a bit too much stress coaxing my child to let me try \\&quot;one more time\\&quot; I went ahead and ordered.  Very simple design, but they worked like a charm! Of course she now insists that I use them to remove her earrings each time, that isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
    <li> This tool was the answer to my daughter&#x27;s fear about taking out her starter earings.  She was afraid it would hurt, after the first attempt by hand didn&#x27;t go well.  The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars was because it can be a little tricky to use, but otherwise did a great job and stopped the melt down we were having about changing her earings (for the first time....over a year and half after getting them pierced).  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Tried to remove a stuck earring and when the remover was operated the  plastic prongs bent before the earring backing moved.  It didn&#x27;t work for a stuck earring.</li>
    <li> THE BEST THING EVER MADE!!! At least it is when you have been trying to get your starter earrings off for weeks. All the tugging and pulling in the world couldn&#x27;t get my earrings off. The front actually broke off the stud when my fianc&amp;eacute;e tried to pull them out causing the metal front to pull into my ear. It was super traumatic and I was panicking. I bought this little contraption and within 10 minutes of getting it home, the earrings were out of my ear and my new ones were in with no pain or struggle. This is genius. Best money I have spent in a long time!</li>
    <li> Gave the product as a gift and it was simple and easy and worked great for the price.&lt;br /&gt;No complain at all bought two more for my family.</li>
    <li> My daughter (3) has hated it when I take out her starter earrings, until tonight!  With this tool we were able to easily remove her earrings without tugging on her ear.  Even my husband was able to get the earrings out of her ears.  Wish I had this months ago.</li>
    <li> I received the ez-Release today and within 5 minutes had the back off my starter earing! Works great and would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works! Gets the piercing earrings or any tight posts off painlessly. Might take a few tries to get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> It broke when I used it for the first time when I received it.  Amazon was great, though, with the return of item and credit.  All is good!</li>
    <li> i would highly recommend this for removing any starter earrings.  almost anticlimactic how easy and fast it is to use.</li>
    <li> So glad I found this - lifesaver for helping my 10 year old take out her starter earrings.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Received the ez-release a couple pf day ago and have been using it ever since trying to remove my butterfly backs off my starter earrings. I feel I have wasted my money on this as they haven&#x27;t moved my backs at all, they&#x27;re still stuck! The plastic probgs have bent because I have been pushing so hard.</li>
    <li> Was great! Worked perfectly!</li>
    <li> This product works great! We had tried to get starter earrings out with tears &amp; I found this online...took 1 second &amp; the backing pops right off - no pain! Worth every penny, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Both my girls had their ears pierced recently and i was able to remove the earings quickly and easily. This little contraption is a keeper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this. Our first attempt in trying to get my daughter&#x27;s starter backs off ended in tears (and we were not able to remove the backs). With this tool, they came off in seconds with no problem or pressure on her earlobe.</li>
    <li> This thing barely helped I mostly had to remove my piercing with my fingers</li>
