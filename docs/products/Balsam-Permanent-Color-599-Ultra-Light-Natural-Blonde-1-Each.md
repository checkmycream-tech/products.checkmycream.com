<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great color. Love this shade..doesn&#x27;t leave your hair dry either.</li>
    <li> I bought this one a subscribe &amp; save sale. I don&#x27;t dye my hair blond, but my cousin does, and the price was right, so I ordered it. She reported back to NEVER buy it again, regardless of the price because it burned her scalp. Now, I don&#x27;t like all of my cousins, so maybe in the future I can give it to a cousin I don&#x27;t like, but you should not purchase this for yourself or for something you actually like. My cousin said she would never use it again no matter how many I gave her. Just be careful with purchasing this one. We got the ultra light blond</li>
    <li> This 3 pack is a great price and the color is true to the listing. I&#x27;ve never had an issue with the Clairol brand of hair dye leaving my skin with a rash or dying my skin. Though it&#x27;s always best to test hair dye on your skin before applying just in case you do have a reaction to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply and does include the gloves inside of the instructions. As well, those are easy to follow.</li>
    <li> Love this, definitely works</li>
    <li> yay blonde hair color! I got an epic deal on these so decided to try it out! I haven&#x27;t dyed my hair yet but ill be going from dark brown to blonde so hopefully it turns out ok!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received this product at a discounted price. Thank you so much. I can&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
    <li> Natural hair dye?! Yes please!!!! It smells better than the normal stuff, none of those nasty chemicals and ready for the best part?&lt;br /&gt;It works great!!!! Even color, no brass ones, and no damage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free to leave an unbiased review</li>
    <li> I purchased this Clairol Ultra Light Blonde, as I&#x27;ve always used Clairol products, but ended up not using it as I have decided to embrace nature&#x27;s decision to turn my hair gray!</li>
    <li> This dye did nothing color wise. I have dyed red hair, Yes its a hard color to get out but i have never had problems with blond hair dye taking it out, This stuff didn&#x27;t even lighten my dirty blond roots.</li>
    <li> Definitely not for making dark hair lighter (as it says on the box), but great if you want to get a pretty, deep auburn on your black or dark brown hair without bleaching it.&lt;br /&gt;Works fairly quickly and formula is thick and not drippy. Rinses out easily. Chemical smells fade rapidly.</li>
    <li> My order was delivered and 2 of the hair dyes had blown up.</li>
    <li> Burned my scalp immediately upon applying. I have colored my hair many times and have never had that reaction. Will not buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> Clairol is a wonderful brand and this is a great option for coloring your hair blonde at home.  Works best if you already have lighter hair, color is nice without being brassy or orange.  The price here on Amazon is unbeatable and this is a great way to experiment with your hair.</li>
    <li> I really love the color of the clariol balsam hair color 599 ultra light it matches my regional color great it took out the dark an gray colors in my hair this hair color worked great on my hair .</li>
    <li> Looking for a easy to use dye? If so this one is worth getting.  &amp;#34;I received this product as a promotion in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions stated are 100% my own&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This stuff did NOTHING. My daughters hair is light brown. We put this hair dye on it...and NOTHING. her roots were slightly lighter but the rest was the same color as before we started. I dont know how this is called ultra light , WRONG!</li>
    <li> I have dirty blonde hair and I tried this dye. It did nothing but burn the hell out of my scalp worse than even the strongest bleach. Avoid this product. Even though I got it for free I regret this purchase!</li>
    <li> Really nice hair colors! 💁💆💇</li>
    <li> Got these cheap and I love this color on me.this dye actually stays in my hair unlike other hair dyes that wash out</li>
    <li> Just used my first box yesterday. Great product.</li>
    <li> Really deserved 0 stars, this is a very harsh dye. Does not come with any special conditioner. I&#x27;m glad it was apart of a free Amazon promotion because I would never spend money on this</li>
    <li> Good buy on three pack hair dye.</li>
    <li> Fantastic and I don&#x27;t even have to go hunting and shopping for it.  Just comes to my front door.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Great Deal and perfect color. thanks</li>
    <li> Makes hair waaaaaaay lighter if its dark then the package shows</li>
    <li> didnt change a single shade on my brown hair color....good thing it was free...</li>
    <li> In this case I suppose I got what I paid for. The color was not quite what I expected and one of the bottles was busted inside a box so I threw that one away.</li>
    <li> I also have used this product for over 20 years and have found nothing that works as well ON MY HAIR.  Even my fairly expensive hairdresser has commented that the product seems to have made my hair fuller and that he sees no downside to how it treats my hair.  Having short hair, I am able to split the product content and get 2 uses from the box, also starting with the roots as someone else mentioned, then blending for the final 5 minutes.  One of the blonde colors I mixed turned black which scared the .... out of me, but, as Clairol assured me, the result was indeed blonde.  Bottom line, works well for some, not for others.  Trial and error like most products.</li>
    <li> The color was very natural looking and is very pretty once its set. I liked that it did not excessively dry my already-dry hair.</li>
    <li> My wife Has been using this product for several times and loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Love the results it gives and how it makes her hair feel. Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take a ton of time.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover gray good</li>
    <li> I chose a one star rating because I did the allergy test and waited the recommended time and I had no allergic reaction to it I had it in my hair for the recommended time and it caused blood blisters on my head no burning or anything during treatment, I woke up after washing it out and I had blood blisters all over my head, and the smell is potent if you do buy this product I suggest doing it in a big area or outside it was hard to breath with how strong the smell was. and my hair didn&#x27;t turn out light blond it came out dirty blond and my hair wasn&#x27;t even dark before it was a very light brown but it only changed my color by one shade :( I was very disappointed!!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s blonde hair color..it works. Lol I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> It is great to be able to find this again, none of our local stores carries it.  So easy to use and coves the gray perfectly.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dye it does not dry ur hair out ... leaves it nice and shiny I am very happy with this product</li>
    <li> Nice color, perfect blonde</li>
    <li> I bought this here on Amazon and got a great price, much better than I would pay locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This actually did exactly what I wanted it to.  My hair is naturally very light blonde- very close to what is pictured on the box- but at nearly 50 it is turning quite white.  It is very long and the effect was gold on the bottom and white on the top.  This color had a lot of what I call &#x27;purpling&#x27; in it- it develops into a lot of purple whiich works very good at toning down the gold and yellow tones - the brassiness, some call it.&lt;br /&gt;I only used one box, streaking it through my hair.  It only worked on about half the white even leaving it on the full 35 minutes.  BUT, it did manage to give my head a more uniform appearance with some blonde up top where it was all white and lightening the bottom some and toning the yellow down.  I think it will help me go white a lot more gracefully now.  I am very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does STINK.  I mean, the ammonia in this about KILLED ME.  My cat ran out of the bathroom.  I had to open up the door and turn on the fan.  There&#x27;s no conditioner with it either.  I used a Pantene deep conditioner I had afterwards and some argan oil and so far my hair does not seem dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my waist length hair, if I&#x27;d opted for complete coverage it would have taken 2-3 boxes.I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s enough in the box for short to shorter medium length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very neutral color, it is not at all ashy.</li>
    <li> Good,I got the product with out any damage the packing was nice.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely the best hair color I have found</li>
    <li> So easy to mix and use.  Gives hair the shine it&#x27;s been missing.  Great color</li>
    <li> They say blondes have more fun and maybe they do.  This always leaves my hair in good condition and a very beautiful blonde.</li>
    <li> Turned out about as expected, being a bit darker than the box shows due to their natural hair color(dark brown).</li>
    <li> This was super cheap and I was nervous about using it.  I have been using some Nutrisse and Loreal hair colors to dye my hair blonde (I normally have black hair) and got these for the occasional touch up (roots and general).  This seems to do the trick I can use this every once in a while and keep my hair looking blonde for a very low cost.  I am very happy with this stuff, it is basic and nothing special (no conditioner) but works as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will state that you want to apply it pretty quickly, it did start turning a purplish color in the bottle while I was still applying it which was kind of odd.  It did not seem to change anything and the hair still dyed to the proper blonde color I was looking for.  For cost and ease this is a great choice!</li>
    <li> Happy that I can still find this product for my own personal use!</li>
    <li> i love this haircolor it is great</li>
    <li> Great product - great seller. As expected, hair color worked great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different hair colors, but my local store was out of the brand I usually use- so I thought I&#x27;d give Clairol Balsom Color a try. I was trying to get my hair about two shades lighter than my natural dishwater blond. I didn&#x27;t want bleach blond, but something light and natural looking. This hair dye is VERY subtle. It will only lighten your hair one or two shades- it&#x27;s certainly not a bleaching blond dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the package you will find two liquids, like you do with most over-the-counter hair dyes. You mix them together to activate the ingredients. This dye turns sort of a dark forest green color when it activates. It worried me a little, because I had never seen another dye act that way before. But I applied it nevertheless. It comes with gloves and easy-to-read bilingual instructions. The application is pretty self explanitory- basically just put it on your hair! haha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest downfall, and by far the reason I won&#x27;t by this hair dye again, was the awful odor. The hydrogen peroxide literally made me cough. I had my fan on full blast in my bathroom, but the smell was overwhelming. I accidently took a big breath and it stung my throat. I had to run out of the bathroom gasping for my breath. I have never smelled a more powerful bleaching stench in a hair dye before. It was almost unbarable. Once I finished applying it though, as it activated a little further, the smell did subside. Even so, I have to point out that if you are sensative to smells- this product is definitely not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once applied it took about 20 minutes to fully color my hair. While the dye was on my head it appeared as though no changes had been made. My hair color remained the same all the way through the dyeing process. But once I rinsed my hair that changed. I do want to point out that this particular set does not come with an after-dye conditioner. So I do recommend that you purchase a high quality professional conditioner to use with this dye. It will definitely dry out your hair, and your hair needs to be rehydrated after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I rinsed, conditioned, and dried my hair- it came out to be more of a strawberry blond color. It definitely isn&#x27;t &#x27;ultra light&#x27; like the package says, but it does look natural. It blended my roots with the remainer of my hair- and that was really my goal. For the price, I think there are better options on the market. The smell was definitely a bit too much for me, and the hair color itself isn&#x27;t exactly what I was looking for. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll achieve the results the box shows, unless you already have very light blond hair.will definitely dry out your hair, and your hair needs to be rehydrated after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I rinsed, conditioned, and dried my hair- it came out to be more of a strawberry blond color.

    <li> Good inexpensive hair color.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is THE best hair color. I&#x27;ve used it for over 10 years and always get compliments.</li>
    <li> No, it wasn&#x27;t bright enough#</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for several years, and alternate between salon visits and at home kits. This 599 \\&quot;ultra light blonde\\&quot; by Clairol (Balsam) was on sale at our local dollar store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other Clairol products, never had any issues, and had no issue with the allergy test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I started applying the color to my hair, the stench almost knocked me out. The chemical smell was so strong I had to stand in the middle of my back yard in a snowstorm wearing nothing but boots and a housecoat to apply the color without choking. I&#x27;m not exaggerating- my husband was complaining about the stench from the second story of our home before I ran into the yard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I won&#x27;t be buying this garbage again.</li>
    <li> I used one of these the other day..&lt;br /&gt;I have dark brown hair &amp; I&#x27;ve tried to go lighter to a redish color one day with a different hair box &amp; it did not work...&lt;br /&gt;I felt like I had just wasted time and money.&lt;br /&gt;I had these boxes just sitting there &amp; one day before I showered I decided to just try it cause what could go wrong, right?? haha&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t leave it in for the entire time because I had a crying 3 month old downstairs but it really made my dark brown hair lighter...&lt;br /&gt;I actually got a light red color to my hair &amp; I was so happy!</li>
    <li> Perfect hair color.  It&#x27;s not yellow like some boxes.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> Such a pretty shade! It made my hair feel very nice after dying. Looks healthy!</li>
