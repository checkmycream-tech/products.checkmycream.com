<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Used alone, it took care of my year-long battle with skin disorders. I add no other medication or topical cream.</li>
    <li> Great for dry - dry skin.  Adds so much moisture to the skin.  Use it daily to take away any ash from your skin.</li>
    <li> This oil tends to get everywhere..!  Even with a dispenser tip, the oil kind of splashes out.  One must be particularly cautious to not get it on clothes, furniture, etc..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of effectiveness, I bought this purely to rub into some raised scars I have accumulated over the years.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if this is helping too much with that, but it sure is moisturizing.  Even hours after having rubbed in into your skin, your skin tends to stay soft and supple.  I keep the bottle at work, where I use it every so often to keep my hands soft as I wear latex gloves all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Swivel Stick for my scars over this product.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  I honestly have not noticed any difference in my saggy, stretch marked tummy area.  But it is such a silky, great oil, I enjoy the feel of it very much.  I have only been using it twice a day for one week and it feels like a treat instead of a chore to apply it.  It will be such a bonus if it actually smooths out my skin.  Oh, at night twice a week I use a .05 derma needle roller before applying the oil, for better absorption.</li>
    <li> It arrived fast last &amp; been using it daily out of shower. Oil smells ok &amp; absorbs as much as any oil can.  I use it at night after I shower &amp; it makes my skin feel great the next day. Its only been one week to see any results on the &amp;#34;therapy&amp;#34; but i feel after a few weeks i should and most likely will keep ordering.</li>
    <li> Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula Skin Therapy is a very nice oil that seems to seals the concern areas.  It helped cover a scar and I think it helped with an itchy area on the skin too.  Yes, I would certainly buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try out the product. At first it moisturized my skin, but then after several uses it had the opposite effect of what the product intended. I have uneven skin tone, scars, and stretch marks in certain areas from fluctuating weight gain and weight loss. I thought this product will help...even bought a second bottle thinking I need to lather on more of it, but it actually made my skin drier and itchy.    I read several reviews about this product from other sites and heard rave reviews about it.  Contrary to popular reviews, this product did nothing for me except for making my skin drier and itchier. Something in the ingredients is making my skin not reacting well to the product.  This product may work for you, however it didn&#x27;t work for me. I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> IT HELPS ME WITH MY DRY SKIN. IT REALLY MOISTURIZES. I USE IT THEN WASH IT OFF IN THE SHOWER. I CLEAN OUT THE SHOWER IMMEDIATELY AFTER USING IT.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT body oil, good moisturizing and amazing job at fading stretch marks...I put 4 stars because the process could be faster lol..I use this oil once to twice a day, and nearly all my stretch marks are gone (and boy i had TONs of them). Ive be religiously using it (mixing it with my body lotion) for about 3-4 months. I probably never will stop using it. It&#x27;s cheap and it works! Just like the rest of Palmer&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders with dry skin! I would recommend this to anyone! I use it instead of lotion and my skin feels amazing!</li>
    <li> I am 5&#x27;10\\&quot; and grew very quickly.. because of this my skin produced these little devils that every woman hates: stretch marks. My stretch marks are not deep, they are light and not noticeable to most... but they certainly are to me, which was making me insecure as I grew older. I have always had them around my breasts, hips and thighs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always read that it is difficult, if not impossible, to rid yourself of stretch marks. The therapy oil was on sale, so I figured I have nothing to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle recommends using this product two to three times a day. I use it once a day, after a shower. (I don&#x27;t like to carry it anywhere with me because the cap comes off on mine all the time, completely destroying one of my shower bags.) I have been using it a month, and I have noticed that the scars are less noticeable. Completely gone? No. But they are less visible, which is all I could really ask for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not think this would work if you have deep stretch marks from pregnancy or severe weight loss/gain. Maybe if you use this product religiously it could work, but I seriously doubt it. (Let&#x27;s be honest, if this was the answer to all of our stretch mark problems it certainly would NOT cost $7.00 :)..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use the oil to soften my hands as well. I like to use the Dead Sea Salt Scrub - All Natural - Coconut and Vanilla and put this on afterwards. I always get comments on how soft my hands are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For pregnant woman I would suggest using their lotion, more for the convenience, and also I do not particularly like the feeling of putting clothes on after rubbing on oil. My sister sent me Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa butter in all different sizes so that I could always carry it with me. I would rub it on my belly throughout the day.. Neither she nor I have any pregnancy scars.</li>
    <li> I bought this after seeing a commercial that mentioned it works on scars. I have a couple of acne scars on my face that I&#x27;ve been trying to fade for years with Mederma. It&#x27;s true that Mederma does get rid of scars, but the burning it causes gets so intense that I can only use it in short spells. Therefore my progress had been slow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give this a try since it&#x27;s gentle and people say it works. I&#x27;ve just started so I&#x27;ll report back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impressions are good. The consistency is amazing. It goes on like oil but feels like powder when you rub it in. Really interesting texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not greasy but it does leave a residue on my skin, just like all skin oils I&#x27;ve used. Therefore I can only use it at night because now my face is shiny. That&#x27;s okay though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is like a weird floral chocolate. I don&#x27;t mind cocoa butter, in fact I use cocoa butter products. But this is something else. Artificial and almost chemical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also agree that the packaging is awful. There is no way to get this out without a mess so I just do it carefully and hope for the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complaints aside, if this fades my scars, I&#x27;ll be very happy. There is no easy way to get rid of scars without plastic surgery, so I&#x27;ll trade oily and messy over intense burning any day.</li>
    <li> I recently incurred a nasty rash of small red bumps under one of my eyes. The bumps were painless, and after some self-diagnosis I figured I had a form of dermatitis, which isn&#x27;t uncommon in females of my age. The cause of dermatitis is generally cosmetics or stress. Either way, while the bumps weren&#x27;t painful and I didn&#x27;t see any reason to involve doctors that didn&#x27;t mean I wanted them to stick around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own several Palmers products, and decided to give this one a try on the bumps, having read that moisturizing can help reduce them. I have been applying this to my face for a week, and the dermatitis spots are almost gone. There is still a faint red mark on my skin, but it&#x27;s fading. So far, so good. Even though this is an oil, it absorbs into the skin *very* quickly; I also will occasionally use olive or coconut oil on my skin, and Palmer&#x27;s oil dissolves in far less than half the time. You can easily incorporate it into a morning routine without fear that your skin will be greasy when you leave the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have obviously had great results using this on my face, but if you have extremely sensitive skin you might want to stick to body use only. This product also has done wonders for my hands and cuticles, and is doing a bang-up job at keeping my skin supple over the dry winter months. I do have some mild stretch marks along my thighs, and I haven&#x27;t noticed them reducing in appearance. However, since that isn&#x27;t what I bought it for it has no bearing on my rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negatives to this product are 1) it&#x27;s definitely not portable. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend toting it around with you; and 2) the smell may be a turnoff to some people. I actually don&#x27;t mind the smell; it&#x27;s cocoa butter, and not artificial. But it is quite pungent on application, and this may annoy some. However, the smell does not linger.</li>
    <li> Great oil! Easy absorption and natural ingredients, just what I was looking for. I used it during my pregnancy and after then as well. Great results. Very happy about my purchase. The only reason for giving 4 stars is the smell. A little bit strong in the beginning but you get used to without problem</li>
    <li> After using this product for one day I noticed an improvement! My scar was lighter and my skin was much smoother. Great seller!</li>
    <li> I bought thhese products for my wife, and she loves it enough to want me to order more. With that said I will order more and would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I just love palmer.. so far all the products live up to the what they say they would do. very happy</li>
    <li> So moisturizing, smells like cocoa butter and keeps you mositurized the whole day. It actually helped lighten my dark spots on underarm since i got like a scar.</li>
    <li> Smells like chocolate doughnuts then fades to a light baby powder scent. My dogs like it......great on my skin I love it. It&#x27;s made my stretch marks turn silver.</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday at least  twice a day and I would recommend to others as well. It helps with acne marks or dark spots.</li>
    <li> Oil is a great product,  just be warned, this version smells like 80 year old in a bottle.  Product is great, but we found the smell to be... not for us.&lt;br /&gt;The Rosehip fragrance version smells so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t really knock this product down from 5 stars because its a great product but the smell for us was nasty.  again the Rosehip fragrance is much better smelling.</li>
    <li> The fragrance was different from the sample package I had used, but I think it is an overall good product.</li>
    <li> Developed a hole in the toe at first wearing.  It was ok for the price.</li>
    <li> Both of my daughters have had eczema since they were babies.  Have tried all kinds of lotions and creams.  I bought Palmer&#x27;s oil on a whim because it was cheaper than another kind of body oil I had been using on their skin.  Palmer&#x27;s is a little bit thicker and does a better job of moisturizing their skin.  I put it on them after their bath while their skin is still damp.  It does a great job of preventing flare-ups.</li>
    <li> This product is improving the appearance of my Keratosis Pilaris (bumps on my upper arms). I would not say that it is going away yet, but the bumps are not as red and inflamed as before I started using this product. It is also helping to fade my new stretch marks from having a baby recently, but mostly the ones on my stomach and not as much of a difference on the marks on my thighs and hips. Probably because those areas are harder to really massage the oil into. The product is also very messy to use, but worth it in my opinion. I find the smell of it pleasant.</li>
    <li> I am a difficult person to convince...but this oil left me speechless. I had a dark patch under my arms. I bought the sking therapy oil and within a week of using this product, the dark patches were totally gone, I could not believe how fast it worked!.&lt;br /&gt;Also, my daughter had her belly pierced and the surrounding area became very red and tender, she started using the oil, and in a matter of 7 days her skin was renewed! I recommend this product 100%</li>
    <li> Works extremely well on scars. Does have an overpowering smell, but you get used to it.</li>
    <li> It has a pleasant smell. The purpose for it that stated on the bottle is not true. It did not meet my expectation. I would not buy it again. I used it for 2 months 3 times a day and did not see any changes.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product. Usually in lotions or oils, they do not last very long but this one is very effective. I could write on and on but I hope I&#x27;ve made it clear that (for an oil) this is one of the top products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, I love Neutrogena products, especially the soaps, IMO, in every category of consideration, the Palmer&#x27;s oil is way better than the Neutrogena oils.</li>
    <li> I had been wanting to buy this product for sometime. First of all it&#x27;s in a bigger plastic squirter type bottle. The smell is very light and the product is great for those who dont have the patience for thick lotions. The oil does take sometime to absorb as well. It could be used if you plan on lounging about..like if your around the house or entertaining guests poolside. I had the impression I would be recieving a smaller bottle. Any regards I like the product and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> After reading all these reviews I wanted so badly to like this oil. But after using it my skin broke out in hives or little bumps all over my face!!! I put it up and revisited this a year later and same thing! My skin allergic to something that&#x27;s in there. If this happens to you aloe Vera juice and coconut oil with help. It took 3 days for the hives to go away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product a few days for a few scars on my forearms and shins, and a few stretch marks on my hips. Obviously, it&#x27;s a little too soon to see a noticeable change in the scars&#x27; appearance.. but I&#x27;m noticing a huge change in the way my skin looks and feels. My skin actually looks like its got a healthy glow, and it&#x27;s never been this smooth or silky or hydrated in my entire life. I put it on my face and my complexion is actually clearing up and smoothening out. I put it on my hands and feet and they&#x27;re smooth and hydrated. My skin feels wonderful. It&#x27;s only been a few days and I&#x27;m loving this! The oil itself is, well, thin and oily. It soaks in, but is left feeling \\&quot;moist\\&quot; for about 20 minutes or so afterwards. I don&#x27;t find it to be much of an issue. I actually really like the smell of the oil. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing a possible change in scar appearance, and as of right now I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Great Product, but for some reason the bottle leaks!! Oh well I&#x27;ll just put it in a container that doesn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> Love the pump on this. So much easier to apply</li>
    <li> I had surgery several months ago to remove my thyroid, lymph nodes, and tumors in my neck area due to thyroid cancer-- luckily, I&#x27;m healthy now, but unluckily, I have a massive scar that travels down from just under my ear and across my entire neck. I&#x27;m not too vain, but I wanted to see if I could lighten it up a bit because it is a little bit distracting. I had heard cocoa butter was good for scars, and decided to pick up a bottle of this since my mom had used some of their products in the past. I&#x27;ve been applying it to my scar and haven&#x27;t noticed any major differences (granted, this has been within two days), HOWEVER-- I had two parallel burns on my forearm that I got about a week ago from accidentally bumping a hot oven rack. They had been healing fairly slowly, and I decided to rub a bit of this oil on them while I was putting it on my neck scar. About two hours after I did this, I looked at my arm and the two burn marks (which were dark and scabbed prior) were LIGHT pink and the scabbing had begun to come off of them. I put some more of it on the burns the next day, and got the same result-- even lighter and much smoother to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the results I got with the burn marks are any indicator of this product&#x27;s effectiveness, I trust it will help a great deal with the scarring on my neck. Aside from that, the pricing is reasonable and the oil smells really good-- very chocolatey and almost fruity at the same time. The consistency of the oil is pretty thin; it&#x27;s watery and can be a bit messy when pouring it from the bottle, but it&#x27;s also got an almost powdery feeling to it, plus it&#x27;s non-staining and soaks into the skin extremely fast, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about ruining your clothes (I&#x27;ve stained several shirts with pure vitamin E oil before).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the shockingly fast results I got with the burns on my arm gave me a great deal of faith in this stuff. I plan on continuing the application of it to my neck scar, and based on what I saw with the burn marks, I have a feeling it will work well.</li>
    <li> 1st time using this, only been abt a week so far. Hard to tell how much its helping.</li>
    <li> Delivered as described and in a timely manner!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s such a great products! The fragrance is awesome! I would definitely recommend this to all my friends! Thank you!</li>
    <li> this oil is godsend! Scars that I have had for 12+ years are FADING. My scars were keloids and now they are getting flat. On the bottle it says you can use this three or more times a day but I usually only use it once a day because i&#x27;m usually so busy running around. I have only had the oil for about 2 months at most , its working pretty quickly. i was considering getting surgery but now i think I might just stick with the oil and see how things work out. You will not regret this purchase!</li>
    <li> i just got this product and after using it,my skin became very soft.i think i ll start to use it more often.</li>
    <li> The oil makes my face smooth and soft. I use it at bedtime since it may be a bit too greasy in the morning, unless one doesn&#x27;t wear make-up.</li>
    <li> I have super dry skin.  It was nice but didn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended for use to help reduce scarring after surgeries. Not a bad little oil to use when you want to spoil yourself either. For an oil, it has a nice fragrance and isn&#x27;t at all sticky.</li>
    <li> I bought the 2fl oz. from walmart for about $7. I have been using this oil for about a month now and I am already seeing improvements in my skin. But be warned \\&quot;alittle goes a long way\\&quot; when you are using this oil for your face. With that said, when I first started using this on my face the oil began to breakout my face with awful pimples. I was about to give up on this product but I continued to use it anyway. With time the pimples began to disappear. The acne scars around my jawline and hairline are beginning to fade. This stuff is great on strecth marks!!! It is alittle on the messy side though, so when I use it on my body I mix it with a unscented lotion. It&#x27;s a very good product!!!</li>
    <li> I use this together with the palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter lotion, mixing these two really works great!</li>
    <li> I really like the way it feels.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help my dry skin gain back its resiliency (due to recent, yet dramatic,  lack of exercise &amp; other &#x27;aging&#x27; environmental factors). No product will ever do wonders in minutes, but I can confidently say it gave my skin visible suppleness &amp; much needed nourishment in those few weeks. Seriously, we underestimate what a difference hydration and a few vitamins can do to our skin!&lt;br /&gt;However, after reading all the reviews, I am shocked so few mentioned the DISTINCTIVE baby powder smell this product has.  If you use it just on your face? That is miniscule. Use it on your whole body?That&#x27;s major!&lt;br /&gt;Unless I am a &amp;#34;mommy-to-be&amp;#34; or a &amp;#34;new mommy&amp;#34;,  I would prefer my baby powder odor to a minimum. Above all other reasons I can list, most important is that it interferes with my perfume scent.&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least, in order to see results in your skin you have to use it continuously. Somehow, I find it difficult during humid and warm summers of NYC.</li>
    <li> Wish it didn&#x27;t have all the chemicals in it.  Otherwise, it smells great.</li>
    <li> It really doesn&#x27;t do anything to your skin except grease it up, if you want something for even skin tone, leading scars and stretch marks, go for bio-oil</li>
    <li> Works just fine . Use this continuously the moisturizer really heals dry skin .</li>
    <li> This product is great. I&#x27;m 75 years old and have crepe paper wrinkles around my eyes. Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula Skin Therapy Oil makes them vanish. And, it takes just a tiny amount to treat your whole face and arms.Enough said.</li>
    <li> i have been using it for less than a month on scars, and it really does work.&lt;br /&gt;the only reason i don&#x27;t give it a five star rating is due to the baby powderish smell after you put it on. i cannot stand that smell.</li>
    <li> The first thing I&#x27;ll say about this product is that it is most definitely not a miracle product. You can&#x27;t use it for a week and see results right away. Since I received this on January 11th, I&#x27;ve been using it consistently on my face every day, usually twice a day. I&#x27;ve seen a small difference, but people who know me claim it&#x27;s been a big difference from the state of my face until now. I don&#x27;t have acne, but the periodic pimples I do get almost always leave marks on my face (whether I pop them or don&#x27;t), and I have a burn mark from 3 years ago from a hot curling iron right on the middle of my forehead. The product really IS working. Not only has my skin reacted well to it, it smells nice and a little of it goes a long way. I haven&#x27;t even used a quarter of the product yet, and it&#x27;s been about a month. Lot of bang for your buck. I would say if anyone looking for something to even out their skin tone and is really ready to see results and not give up, this is the product for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I also decided to the product on my bikini line, and that has actually stopped it from itching right after shaving/waxes. I put a bit on it right after a shave and my ingrown hairs cease and bumps have faded. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> I just recently started using this and it works wonders. The smell is pleasant and there is no oily residue.... just softness. I am using it on 2 sun age spots and it is already fading them in a weeks time. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter oil has worked very well for me. I have used it before in the past, and have recently started using it again because I noticed I&#x27;ve been developing some new stretch marks. I&#x27;ve noticed a little improvement in the stretch marks in the few weeks I&#x27;ve been using it again. As long as you use it multiple times a day, for a good amount of time, it does help with stretch marks. The reason I really love it is because it absorbs quickly and really helps to hydrate my skin. I find the smell of it to be kind of strange but it makes my skin unbelievably soft so I don&#x27;t mind. At one point I was using Bio-Oil, which costs three times as much as this does, and I have to say that it doesn&#x27;t produce results that are worth the high price. I like the Palmer&#x27;s oil better and it&#x27;s cheap enough that I don&#x27;t mind using a good amount all over my body.</li>
    <li> Greasy gives me pimples in my body</li>
    <li> not really work for me</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading reviews that it faded stretch marks.  I didn&#x27;t believe it was going to work because if there were a miracle cure for stretch marks, everybody would be buying it.  It&#x27;s been over a month and I have to say, the stretch marks on my inner thighs have faded dramatically.  Let&#x27;s be clear they are still there but are not as noticeable.  Sometimes I stare at my thighs and I&#x27;m shocked really.  Just for that I am giving this 4 stars.  Everywhere else though I am not seeing a big difference (hips knees, lower back) but I will keep trying.  If this oil can work so well on my stretch marks, I would assume it would be great with scars (which I don&#x27;t have).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other advantages that I have experienced include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Softens skin.  It&#x27;s a bit messy but so worth it.  It leaves your whole body looking fresh and moisturized.  In the summer with a tan, your legs will look unbelievable without looking overly shiny.&lt;br /&gt;--Combats wrinkles.  I put it on my hands and they look much better. At night I also apply the oil under my eyes and on my forehead to combat wrinkles.  And no, I did not get any acne.  It&#x27;s also great for feet.  My feet are moisturized all winter.&lt;br /&gt;--Has a light, chocolaty scent. It&#x27;s really pleasant unlike the lotion which I don&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other people have posted that it helps with hyper pigmentation and scars.  Listen, if it has this many positive reviews and only costs $14, it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but I prefer the one with rose scent just because I&#x27;m sensitive to scents. Otherwise, the product really works well on injured skin and mosquito bites to prevent scar formation. It meets my expectations of a &#x27;&#x27;dry oil&#x27;&#x27; and when mixed with body lotion, even better.</li>
    <li> they should change the name and the package so it looks more haute coutre, because it can compete and win over just about every body oil out there.&lt;br /&gt;my hair is loosing color, and one squirt of this stuff in my palm, rubbed into my hair restored the color instantly!&lt;br /&gt;this is a great oil to put on your face or body. it goes into your skin and does not leave an oily appearance.&lt;br /&gt;this is a great massage oil for couples, and a wonderful lube if you are in a  monogamous relationship and do not need to use protection (latex).&lt;br /&gt;I recommend that whenever you have the opportunity, do NOT select free shipping, because the Seller does NOT have the item in stock. The Seller must order the item from the Wholesaler, and the Seller must have a minimum order of $400 in order for the Seller to get free shipping from the Wholesaler.&lt;br /&gt;Also, Amazon Prime is a rip-off. The reason is that the items on Prime can usually be bought for at least $6 cheaper on Amazon from another Seller. Additionally, the items on Prime SHIP in two days, but only AFTER the order has been filled. I quit Prime because it took up to TEN days to receive my orders.</li>
    <li> Did not like the smell of the product so much I couldn&#x27;t use it and gave it away.  :(</li>
    <li> I got this for my fiance to rub on her belly and her sides. She has stretch marks from her previous pregnancy, so it&#x27;s hard to tell if it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job or not. The only complaint I have is that after rubbing the lotion in, there seems to be little almost rubber like balls of residue. I can&#x27;t really explain it. It&#x27;s kind of hard to remove from the skin. That&#x27;s my only real complaint.</li>
    <li> I used this product every night during my pregnancy and did not get any stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I always love this product and it great for scars</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I use it on my legs and arms which gives me a nice sun-kissed glow. I also use it after I shave my legs. It makes them super soft, no itchy razor burn, and hydrates the skin. Sometimes I put it in my hair about 30 minutes before I shower, or over night when I plan on washing it out in the morning. As for the smell, it depends on your personal taste. I wouldn&#x27;t put it on my face, which is the original reason I bought it (I was trying to get rid of acne scars). It made me break out. After I use it, I have to wash my hands because I&#x27;ll end up getting it on my face, resulting in pimples. When I use it as directed, I see moderate results when trying to eliminate scars on my body. All in all, I really like it. 4/5 only because nothing is perfect.</li>
    <li> I tried Palmer&#x27;s therapy oil after abdominal surgery. The oil makes my very dry skin feel smooth and soft. Amazing! Other lotions and oils that I have tried have not continued to work throughout the day, but Palmer&#x27;s does.  After using this product every day for a week, there is a noticible difference in the texture of my skin.  It has vitamin E, so the surgery scars are healing well, and are beginning to fade after a month.  I would DEFINATELY recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, Amazon delivered this product ahead of schedule, and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Ugh, I&#x27;m sure it works great but I just can&#x27;t take the sickly sweet smell. Maybe better when I&#x27;m not pregnant anymore but for now - yuck!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this stuff.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now, and it makes me feel great.  I was most surprised that my hands, which look really old for a 25-year-old, plumped up and de-wrinkled with this oil.  And my elbows are smoother than they&#x27;ve ever been!  Everything feels great.  The only potential downside is the smell- I thought it smelled medicinal at first, and my husband said it smells like baby powder.  Now I think it smells like cocoa butter.  Definitely not perfumey though!  But the smell really doesn&#x27;t matter, since it absorbs so fast and there&#x27;s no smell after it&#x27;s absorbed.  Anyway, I use this stuff as after-tanning lotion, after-bath, on my face, hands, elbows, legs, EVERYTHING.  Love!</li>
    <li> Very good stuff! I used it about five days now and noticed results fast. I put it on about every two hours. just in time for summer!</li>
    <li> I purchased Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Vitamin E oil to smooth out a surgical scar and it came highly recommended by a close friend so I tried it.  At first I HATED the smell but once I started to see the results I quickly learned to get over the cocoa butter/light chocolate scent.  This oil makes my skin look positively amazing.  Aside from working wonders on my surgical scar, I started using it on my arms and legs and my skin literally just soaks this in fast.  My hands are smoother and plumper; my feet are so soft even my husband noticed.  This even worked for some slight crepey skin I had so I&#x27;m sold.  I&#x27;ve tried them all; mineral oil, almond oil, sesame oil, you name it.  Palmer&#x27;s is basically canola oil from rapeseeds so it&#x27;s a natural product; for me it works like a charm and my skin looks fabulous.</li>
    <li> I been using this oil for a while and I like the way mt skin is never dry, and the packaging is better now, in the past I received one box that was leaking but the company change the bottle to a spray bottle and it works better.</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT , GOOD CARE OF SELLER</li>
    <li> So this stuff is GREAT!!! I&#x27;m not just saying this either, it really works. I use to be a rough chick so I have dark scars all over my body.. I also have a couple of dark spots from shaving around my bikini area.. I bought this product two weeks ago and started using two times a day &amp; I can definitely already see the difference. I&#x27;m so excited. The marks are lightening up each day &amp; I know because I put the oil on some parts of my body &amp; use regular lotion on other parts to compare the difference.. It&#x27;s definitely working! I cannot wait for the spots around my bikini area to completely disappear... I&#x27;m still waiting to see.. But I def recommend this stuff.</li>
    <li> Ive used 2 bottles so far for my fairly new scars and stretch marks from pregnancy. Nothinf has improved.</li>
    <li> I have used other Palmer&#x27;s products in the past with great success. I fell and got several abrasions a few weeks ago. I am using the Skin Therapy to try to reduce scarring. I will post a follow-up in a few months with the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with the powers of cocoa butter, and this oil is a perfect way to reap the benefits. I use it on my face and hands. It&#x27;s not greasy, and I think it smells great. My makeup goes on smooth over it, and it feels good on the skin. I have fancy, ridiculously expensive moisturizers, but I don&#x27;t use them, I use this.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long, but so far I love it.  Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily, just soft.  Love it for my hands.  I work in the medical field and wash my hands a million times a day.  Sometimes I think it smells like baby powder, and sometimes like chocolate...weird.  But either way, I like the scent.  Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice any scar fading, but that&#x27;s not the primary reason I&#x27;m using it anyway.  I have to say I used it on my face, and I don&#x27;t know if I was over-applying or my face just didn&#x27;t like it.  It caused little pimples and a few cystic pimples.  I switched to the Palmer&#x27;s Skin Therapy Oil for the Face, and I love it so far.  That directs you to apply only a thin layer on your face, so I probably was over-applying the regular Skin Therapy Oil.  In any case, I will continue to use this as a body and hand moisturizer.  It&#x27;s wonderful, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I use it before I go to bed. Works great for me! Absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft. I have been using it on scars from acne to cat scratches and they disappear in a matter of days. I find the smell of it to be wonderful and calming. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> After I had my son, ten months ago, I was desperate to get rid of the horrible stretch marks (on my stomach, thighs, hips, butt and breasts) I got from pregnancy. I had been using Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Massage Lotion for Stretch Marks since I had my baby. I noticed a slight lightening in my stretch marks but not enough to make me happy. My baby sitter suggested that I use this oil. I use it two to three times a day and within a week I saw a major difference in my stretch marks. I continue to use the Massage Lotion as well so I&#x27;m not sure if it is the combination of them both or if the oil is really making all the difference. Either way, I am very pleased with how this product is working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do suggest that you use the product three times a day like the instructions say in order to see results.</li>
    <li> This oil makes me skin feel great, and doesn&#x27;t break it out at all. I&#x27;ve even used it on my face. I don&#x27;t see any difference is spots, etc., but it does make my skin super soft!</li>
    <li> I really love this oil.  It&#x27;s nice and light and absorbs really well without leaving grease everywhere, and the bottle it comes in has a great pump so you don&#x27;t get it all over the place when you&#x27;re trying to apply it.  It&#x27;s not odorless, though, has somewhat of a chocolate smell to it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but it not Bio oil and if they would of package it right I would of been happy</li>
    <li> I have been using this 2-3 times a day throughout my pregnancy... 35 weeks now and no stretch marks. It sinks right in and I think the smell is great.</li>
    <li> It smells kind of like chocolate, but smell dissipates quickly.  Glides on easily, but doesn&#x27;t stay greasy.  I love it!</li>
    <li> My wife started using this product and Within the first week you can see a huge difference. In about 2 to 3 weeks the result was extremely high. I would recommend this product to anyone who have stretch mark and skin issue.</li>
    <li> This came recommended to me by a monitor on a plastic surgery site, as well as my plastic surgeon. This has done wonders to my incision scar! A little messy, but I feel it&#x27;s better than the pomade stuff and cream! Also lasts a REALLY LONG TIME!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I have psoriasis and works wonders for keeping my dry skin hydrated and also making it look better! So it was a win win for me. Although, it may not work for everyone</li>
    <li> I had cancer surgery in August. The process left an app 18 inch s-shaped scar on top of my head, As soon as it had healed enough I began to use this product. People have been amazed at how fast the scar has healed. Its very deep and I don&#x27;t expect it to disappear on my bald head but keeping it moisturized with this stuff has definitely helped. People have also commented on how much healthier the skin on my face looks since I started using it.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I use it alone or when my skin is really dry with Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter lotion.  My skin just drinks it in and it leaves a nice glow to your skin.</li>
    <li> makes my skin more smooth and I love the chocolate smell of the oil. even my daughter now is using this product. its really good for the skin.</li>
    <li> I got this product specifically for a 6&amp;#34; scar after open heart surgery.  I began to apply it twice a day as soon as the surgical glue peeled away and EVERYONE remarks how well my incision has healed.  The doctor&#x27;s, my husband, and those who see the top of the scar peeking out of my neckline are hugely impressed by how good the incision mended after just three months of use.  I also smooth the oil up my neck and have seen great improvement to the thin skin there as well, it&#x27;s actually younger looking.  The product is absorbed easily and doesn&#x27;t remain greasy.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It smells nice too.</li>
    <li> Ooooo this Oil feels so smooth on my skin. Moisturizes and Nourishes very good. Smells good too. Skin feels good about 8 hours while using this oil. I use it after shaving , before bed and after shower. Not greasy or sticky. GREAT</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about long term results but so far I really like this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels really good when applied and has a wonderful subtle scent that I really enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I LOVED this product, it leaves my skin feeling so soft &amp; smooth, I have definitely seen an improvement in my skin texture &amp; would recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> The smell of this product is very strong. I got the original scent with to me smells a lot like mint chocolate chip. But it&#x27;s powerful. It rubs in nicely but the scent can be a little overbearing depending on where you use it</li>
    <li> I have some acne scars that have made it impossible for me to feel comfortable in my own skin so when someone recommended this product I gave it a go. I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a month now and I started seeing results as early as a week. My skin looks a lot better than it used to and I don&#x27;t feel so conscious of the scars. There are still old scars that will take longer to fade, but the newer ones are mostly gone now. Will buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I am 34 weeks pregnant with my third child.  With my previous two, I got a ton of deep stretch marks.  They were finally starting to fade when I found out I was pregnant with this baby.  Determined not to add any more stretch marks, I purchased this product.  I haven&#x27;t seen any new ones so I believe this product has helped me prevent new ones.  It smells great and goes on smooth.  It does stain your clothes though so I do it mainly at night and then wear a t-shirt that I don&#x27;t mind staining.  I really lather it on though.  Good product!</li>
    <li> most ama a z ing product iv had to treat my scars! w o r k s a mazing ly!!!</li>
    <li> This is my 1st time ever writing a review,but I never had an item worthy of writing one hands down the only thing I regret is not using it sooner I truly wish I could upload a before n after pic of how my stomach looks now I&#x27;m amazed at how it works way better then the coca butter cream worth the money</li>
    <li> Ive been using this for about 2 weeks now. My favorite thing about it is how quickly my skin absorbs the oil and stays moisturized throughout the day! Feels great! I mostly use this on my stomach due to insane stretch marks. Not sure if they are going down yet but im going to keep using it! Fingers crossed! Totally buy this if you need a good skin hydrator and are willing to use this 2-3 times a day everyday to see changes!</li>
    <li> I have had four leg surgeries in the past year.  In an effort to make the scars go away, I have tried every high-end product on the market.&lt;br /&gt;This is a reasonably-priced excellent product.  Not gooey like others I have tried.  Product soaks in right away and you can be dressed and on your way. Plus, I can see a difference in the redness of my scars in just two weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about half a year now because I saw great reviews on it being effective on improving the appearance of stretch marks. Unfortunately, I have not seen much change within the months, but will continue using it to see if it helps in the longer run. If anything, the results are definitely not quickly achieved.</li>
    <li> Smoothes my skin and leaves it feeling younger.  Has a great smell after application too. A little oily but most skins types should suck it up.</li>
    <li> I am 7 months pregnant and still have not gotten any stretch marks. I use it in conjunction&lt;br /&gt;with other moisturizers, but I love this one.</li>
    <li> I like how hydrated my skin feels after applying this oil. Definitely reduced the appearance of stretch marks and scars.</li>
    <li> As far as the physical attributes compared to bio oil, palmers is more watery/fluid-like and greasy. For this reason, I would not apply Palmers to my face. I did it once and I felt super oily all day. I got the rosehip fragrance of Palmers oil and it smells pretty good. Compared to bio oil, I couldn&#x27;t pick a favorite if I was choosing based on smell. I bought Palmers because it was cheaper than bio oil and I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> I find this in about every store that sells the regular cocoa butter formula [ranging from 8 - 12 dollars], so I decided to give it a shot. I&#x27;ve tried both this and the Rosehip fragrance, both work about the same. I prefer the original, I think the smell is even better then the lotion and the tub, but I like both oils. If you don&#x27;t like the chocolaty aroma you should try the other one [the box is pink]. I use it under my lotion, the original oil under the cocoa butter lotion and the rosehip under either the Fresh White Lily Eventone body milk or the Shea Butter formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works for my friends stretch marks on her chest but not for mine, it could be because I&#x27;m a bit bigger I&#x27;m not sure. It does help with new scars, making them go away quite fast for me, I had a long scar on my back where I got a glass cut and it&#x27;s almost gone now. Older ones will take forever and/or won&#x27;t fade completely. Even so I still love this oil, the pump bottle is great and the consistency is kind of watery, but in a good way, not thick and greasy like many other oils and it won&#x27;t clog your pores or break out your skin [least it didn&#x27;t do mine] I can even use it on my face for pimple scars.</li>
    <li> I love Palmer&#x27;s it is the best skin therapy I have ever used. Ounce for ounce it is much better than anything I have ever used on my including expensive neck and face creams!</li>
    <li> Using this regularly after showering seemed to even out some dark patches of skin on me, but the oil is also not particularly moisturizing on it&#x27;s own -- it&#x27;s good for summer, not so much in winter.</li>
    <li> I like this oil but I think I will have more use for it in winter. It has a nice texture and smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about everything for my stretch marks on across my lower back and this actually helped.  They aren&#x27;t gone - but they are much less visable.  This also makes your skin feel great - not greasy and it smells really nice.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> My wife uses it to minimize small scars and to enhance smooth skin. I use it for my problem dry skin.  It is not perfumed so if you have a problem with strongly scented lotions, this works well but won&#x27;t cause odor issues.  A concern for folks with Asthma or COPD.  This is now one of my family&#x27;s &amp;#34;essentials&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are hundreds, if not thousands, of lotions but Palmer&#x27;s Therapy Oil stands at the top of the heap.</li>
    <li> My wife used it both during her pregnancy and postpartum and she has no stretch marks. Smells great, is not greasy and lasts a few months. Helped with the c-section scar as well.. She keeps on buying it, so she must be happy.</li>
    <li> I used this during my entire pregnancy! I have no stretch marks at all! It&#x27;s also great for dry skin!</li>
    <li> There is a chocolaty smell, however that goes away after a few mins.  I add a few drops to my face moisturizer in the morning &amp; evening... I have really dry skin and it has helped a lot with that.  The smaller lines under my eyes that are caused from dehydration have definitely gone away!  I also notice that I have an improved all over skin tone. What I really like is that it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling, for me, it soaks in pretty quickly, so putting makeup over it hasn&#x27;t been an issue!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really the best product out there. Light feeling and mats out the oily shine that&#x27;s normally on my face. A very unique and loved oil. Smells heavenly: Chocolaty and floral with a vanilla backdrop. A delicious smell.</li>
    <li> This really helped with my post pregnancy stretch marks. My skin is not completely back to normal (I know it won&#x27;t be), but it&#x27;s greatly improved from what it looked like.</li>
    <li> I buy Palmer&#x27;s Skin Therapy Oil when I can because I have skin that scar easily and it seems I&#x27;m always fighting a loosing battle with trying to fade old and new scars.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the  I will buy again it leaves your skin glowing and soft dries fast I love the smell</li>
    <li> for some reason this make my body iching,,,,,, I don&#x27;t have any rash but it gives me a bad sensation in my skin.</li>
    <li> ok so I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three months on a scar i had from burning myself from a curling iron and i haven&#x27;t noticed any change whatsoever. i don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m using it wrong or not but it has reduced a little of appearance of stretch marks.</li>
    <li> Unbelievably unprofessional and irresponsible seller. I placed an order and after 4 months I didn&#x27;t receive the product. The product is good because I finally ordered it from somewhere else.</li>
    <li> Great stuff and it smells good too.</li>
    <li> Works like your exorbitantly priced boutique oils at a fraction of the price.  I would recommend this to anyone  looking for a restorative lotion, this is great for skin and has replaced its pricier alternative in my routine.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of palmers.  Really penetrates the skin.</li>
    <li> sadly i missed return window. the pump doesn&#x27;t work and it has a terrible smell</li>
    <li> I have been using Palmer&#x27;s products for over five years. I use the oil for my face, neck and hands every day, at least twice a day. I also use it as body oil after shower. I found it specially doing well on dry skin during the winter time.&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work well for my stretch marks on my shoulders and chest. I used half the bottle and didn&#x27;t see the slightest of results. I&#x27;ll continue to use the rest of the bottle, but so far nothing. If they do clear up, I&#x27;ll be sure to fix my review. I give it two stars because it still seems to moisturize my skin and it smells fine. Maybe I bought the wrong product for getting rid of my stretch marks. If anyone can suggest a better product for that please comment.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it before I put my makeup on and after I wash my face. My skin feels so soft. My husband noticed the difference right away.</li>
    <li> This stuff seems to really be helping my neck and throat area, I can really tell the difference.  I&#x27;m also using it on my tummy scars and it seems to be helping them also.  I&#x27;m not 100% crazy about the smell, but it wears off right away so it doesn&#x27;t hinder me buying this again.  I also bought some for my husband and best friend, they love it.  Both to them are noticing improvements around their eye areas, so I guess I will start using it there also!</li>
    <li> If you have a severe burn and/or a severe cut and need faster healing and restoration of the final layer of your skin - this is the product for you. It does wonders. I have a severe burn on my legs due to a reaction from a medication that put on my legs then decided to use nair - It was burned through my skin....... Nothing was working to reduce the redness and whiteness of the area - until i started using the Therapy oil every day - and finally the skin on my legs were back to normal - great Product.</li>
    <li> As we age, dry skin can be a difficult problem to solve.  This product is very effective and easy to use--just spray it on damp skin after showering or bathing and gently rub into the skin.  It has a delicate aroma and doesn&#x27;t set off my allergies to fragrance.  I recommend it highly for both men and women--my husband uses it every day!</li>
    <li> I use this oil i was looking for something to get rid of my strech marks. It works i cant say that its fast but i put it on maybe 2 or 3 times a day and rub it in. i put it more on my stomach then on my sides. its working they are almost gone for the price its a good deal. i will keep using it. the light scent is delightful i like this will keep using it.</li>
    <li> been using this treatment for about two months now and can already see a noticeable weakening of my stretch marks. excited to see how they&#x27;ll be in a few months. STRETCH MARKS B GONE!!</li>
    <li> 100% love this oil! It quickly gets absorbed in your skin.</li>
    <li> just what i needed.  I use it everytime I get out of the bath and my skin feel and looks better</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product, very light and well absorbing. My sensitive, prone to redness skin takes it very well. It smells just like Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter, which has much heavier consistency (the only issue i had using it). I like it even better then highly perfumerized BioOil. I think it&#x27;s especially great for summer, gives my skin amazing appearance and glow. I&#x27;m on my second bottle now!</li>
    <li> Using product post surgery after incision healed, the scar is lightening and the skin more flexible.</li>
    <li> I just tried it again and it is messy, it smelled rancid to me. I did not like the smell I was expecting something more with a coconut smell. I am sorry, just my opinion!</li>
    <li> So far so Gd makes my skin soft</li>
    <li> This oil is wonderful! I apply to my face at night instead of a night moisturizer, and it feels and smells great.  It also has helped even out my skin tone.</li>
    <li> Light oil that absorbs into skin relatively quickly. I use daily and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin so soft and had lighten up some scars.</li>
    <li> My favorite....I&#x27;ve purchased this item several times, and will continue to use. Its great for your entire body, head to toes. It softens dry skin, hairm face.....yoy name it. Great product to keep skin soft and silky.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin super soft without feeling greasy afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great .I have had many compliments on my skin since I started using this.</li>
    <li> This oil is great! it smells good and I love to use it at night as a moisturizer and to massage my face.</li>
