      <li>I personally love, love, love it!</li>
      <li>Perfect for fall and still very sheer.</li>
      <li>but I love it.  </li>
      <li>One more in the &amp;#34;yes</li>
      <li>I really love this product on my lips.  </li>
      <li>I love the screw top since it prevents the lid coming off in my cosmetic bag in my purse.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m taking a cue from Oprah and giving my favorite things for Christmas this year.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s SPF 15 as I have very full lips.</li>
      <li>Has a lovely sweet, sugar-like scent.</li>
      <li>Top of the list is the Fresh Sugar lip treatment in the Sugar Plum shade.</li>
      <li>And goes on so smoothly.</li>
      <li>I feel very elegant but natural wearing it!  </li>
      <li>She was so excited when she opened it.  </li>
      <li>This product was nothing really special.</li>
      <li>only problem is that it melts very easily in heat!  </li>
      <li>I was able to order 6 packages of the same color for gifting, more than was available and the cosmetic store.</li>
      <li>Beware:It will melt if left in the sun since the tube is metal!!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a very unique product that I love.</li>
      <li>Very pretty color and smells</li>
      <li>you have chronic chapped lips, this is definitely worth a try.</li>
      <li>I own the Sugar lip treatments in multiple colors and the Plum is one of my favorites.</li>
      <li>Nice sheer with just the right amount of color.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a nice light lip balm that doesn&#x27;t go on heavy, but gives a tinge of color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect last for a long time and leaves my lips soft.</li>
      <li>When I opened it, it had a funny smell and when I put it on my lips</li>
      <li>The color is consistent.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff -- sheer but adds color.</li>
      <li>I usually order from sephora and the gloss has a pleasant smell</li>
      <li>In either case, I would strongly recommend you go to a store such as sephora and purchase it there.</li>
      <li>Even my Givenchy lipsticks don&#x27;t cost this much.</li>
      <li>It may not be the absolute max in moisturizing --</li>
      <li>This one has a little more of a purple tint than a raisin-like tint I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>Sometimes lip treatments have a bad odor -- this one smells delicious.  </li>
      <li>I actually prefer the non-tinted original version of these product (the white one).</li>
      <li>and you can get a pretty red tint.</li>
      <li>Even lipstick doesn&#x27;t do this, so this was a huge waste of money.</li>
      <li>Helps keep lips soft with a bit of color, but not sticky and no taste or odor.</li>
      <li>Not sure it&#x27;s worth the price though.</li>

<li> Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Really hard to find - thanks!</li>
<li> I feel a strange taste in my mouth.</li>
<li> I was using Chanel before this, but I noticed my lips were getting dry and cracked.</li>
<li> Especially if you&#x27;re looking for some tint to help make the chappedness look less noticable.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s just what I want for everyday wear outside the house.</li>
<li> I bought it, but...for the lip balm properties a $3.50 EOS will do you just as well, and for the color properties there are a lot of other choices at a lower price point.  </li>
<li> I am highly disappointed at how quickly the product broke down.</li>
<li> Lighter than chapstick and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or too &#x27;heavy&#x27;</li>
<li> Her birthday is coming up in a few weeks</li>
<li> Not worth it!!</li>
<li> all you need for that is a tube of Vaseline, seriously --</li>
<li> Seriously addicted.  </li>
<li> Expensive...</li>
<li> I think either the seller is either providing customers with a fake product or selling old/expired products.</li>

    <li> Nice product.  Very pretty color and smells/tastes delicious!  I feel very elegant but natural wearing it!  Reminds me of wine stain on the lips.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff -- sheer but adds color. Lighter than chapstick and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or too &#x27;heavy&#x27;</li>
    <li> Best lip tint out there.  Expensive...but I love it.  I was using Chanel before this, but I noticed my lips were getting dry and cracked. I also noticed there was a difference in color and consistency between the tubes of Chanel that I bought from different stores.  Not so with Lip Sugar.  The color is consistent.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> Seriously addicted.  Best lip balm EVER</li>
    <li> Love this color and the feel on my lips!</li>
    <li> Best stuff for lips!!</li>
    <li> Had to return.  The stick that I got had a funky smell to it.  I usually order from sephora and the gloss has a pleasant smell</li>
    <li> Always my go to color and lip balm.  Nice sheer with just the right amount of color. And goes on so smoothly. One of my favs.</li>
    <li> I bought it, but...for the lip balm properties a $3.50 EOS will do you just as well, and for the color properties there are a lot of other choices at a lower price point.  I haven&#x27;t tried Burt&#x27;s Bees yet, but that&#x27;s my next stop.  Even my Givenchy lipsticks don&#x27;t cost this much.</li>
    <li> great product. Not sure it&#x27;s worth the price though. Has a lovely sweet, sugar-like scent. I actually prefer the non-tinted original version of these product (the white one). This one has a little more of a purple tint than a raisin-like tint I was hoping for. So the &amp;#34;Plum&amp;#34; is a perfect color name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I ordered the cherry at the same time, and that one is way too red for the texture of this balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have chronic chapped lips, this is definitely worth a try. Especially if you&#x27;re looking for some tint to help make the chappedness look less noticable.</li>
    <li> Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Really hard to find - thanks!</li>
    <li> I really love this product on my lips.  The color is perfect on my fair skin, it feels smooth, and smells nice and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that it melts very easily in heat!  Perhaps because the container is metal?</li>
    <li> Product as described. I would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a nice light lip balm that doesn&#x27;t go on heavy, but gives a tinge of color. This is it! It&#x27;s perfect last for a long time and leaves my lips soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m taking a cue from Oprah and giving my favorite things for Christmas this year. Top of the list is the Fresh Sugar lip treatment in the Sugar Plum shade. Helps keep lips soft with a bit of color, but not sticky and no taste or odor. I was able to order 6 packages of the same color for gifting, more than was available and the cosmetic store.</li>
    <li> One more in the &amp;#34;yes it&#x27;s pricey but I&#x27;m addicted&amp;#34; camp. I caught this one at a really good discount moment, though... so I bought 2! The tone and texture are perfect for me, and the SPF makes me feel good about it. It may not be the absolute max in moisturizing -- all you need for that is a tube of Vaseline, seriously -- but it&#x27;s just what I want for everyday wear outside the house.</li>
    <li> This is two great things in one --- a fantastic lipstick and a lip treatment.  Sometimes lip treatments have a bad odor -- this one smells delicious.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I own the Sugar lip treatments in multiple colors and the Plum is one of my favorites. Perfect for fall and still very sheer. If you&#x27;ve never tried this brand, you should. Best feeling lip treatment I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
    <li> This was on my daughters Christmas wish list.  She was so excited when she opened it.  Her birthday is coming up in a few weeks so I am going to surprise her with another one.</li>
    <li> I used the product and I wasn&#x27;t that impressed. I don&#x27;t know what all the hype is about. It moisturizes but Nivea does that, too and it is way cheaper and you can get a pretty red tint. This product was nothing really special. The thing is that the product melted and broke off. It was left in my bag in 70 degree weather. I am highly disappointed at how quickly the product broke down. Even lipstick doesn&#x27;t do this, so this was a huge waste of money. Not worth it!!</li>
    <li> I had not tried this lip treatment until I ordered the item from this site.  It looked really wonderful and so I tried it and it is wonderful,  you won&#x27;t regret this purchase, enjoy!!!</li>
    <li> I wish I could get this lip treatment from Amazon, then I would order it from Amazon Prime all the time. I am going to purchase this for both of my sisters for their birthday!  I personally love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> This provides just enough color along with the moisturizer.  I carry it everywhere I go.  I know you will love it!</li>
    <li> I did not like this product. When I opened it, it had a funny smell and when I put it on my lips I feel a strange taste in my mouth. It says 2009 on the product and I bought one from a store last week which says 2012. The one from the store smells and feels great on my lips. I think either the seller is either providing customers with a fake product or selling old/expired products. In either case, I would strongly recommend you go to a store such as sephora and purchase it there.</li>
    <li> I have read reviews of this gloss complaining about the price but may I remind you-lips require an SPF too as you age.I feel safer wearing thsi with it&#x27;s SPF 15 as I have very full lips.An added sun protection IS more expensive and should be looked on as an investment in the future of your looks.&lt;br /&gt; I love the screw top since it prevents the lid coming off in my cosmetic bag in my purse.The lemony scent is wonderful as is the moisture level.&lt;br /&gt; Beware:It will melt if left in the sun since the tube is metal!!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a very unique product that I love.</li>
