<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Came on time and it was the product promised</li>
    <li> Product is good; but it leaked all over the place. Packaging needs to be improved.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my mother and she likes it.  It will last her forever.</li>
    <li> I like that this helps my blonde highlights stay blonde. This shampoo tones down the brassiness almost immediately. The only con I&#x27;ve found is that I notice it dries out my hair, but any conditioner helps with that.</li>
    <li> DID NOT COME IN ONE CONTAINER W/ A PUMP.  I got two bottles with equivalent shampoo and NO pump.&lt;br /&gt;I do love the shampoo for keeping my white hair from looking yellow.</li>
    <li> Do not like this shampoo,it has a bad smell, it stinks,it seems to have made my hair a little darker.I will have to use it but only once a week it cost to much to throw away.A WASTE OF MONEY</li>
    <li> I  used  this  shampoo  for about  5-yrs.  now  so  I  was  quite  happy  with  the  product  and  will  be  for  some  time  to  come  Linda  Petersen</li>
    <li> The product is excellent, the packaging not so much.  Fortunately it arrived wrapped  in plastic because it had leaked.  Then the pump did not work so I had to use the one from the used one I had thrown away.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for blonde and gray hair.  Gives that extra pizzazz to your color and cleans well also.  Leaves hair easy to style.  The companion conditioner is also available.  Hard to get in the rural midwest, so I especially like this larger bottle!</li>
    <li> Great at removing yellowish greenish tint from gray hair.  Only use it 2-3 times per week or mix it with regular shampoo or you will get a purple tint.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommemded it since my grey-white hair was turning green from other shampoo. This one works great!!</li>
    <li> Received the product and the cap had loosened during shipment. Anyone that uses this product knows how expensive it is and what kind of mess I had. This company wanted me to go out and buy a camera to take pictures of the shampoo soaked shipping carton and send it to them. What a Shame and Sham</li>
    <li> This was a Great purchase experience and this product is perfect for my Nanny&#x27;s soft, soft salt and pepper hair!</li>
    <li> My hair was beginning to look yellow, much to my dismay. After looking on another site, I found that this product was recommended for white/silver hair, so I ordered it from Amazon. It works beautifully.</li>
    <li> great product fast service.</li>
    <li> This is the product my wife has been using for years and loves it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for probably fifteen years and find it is perfect for my silver hair.  That&#x27;s all folks.</li>
    <li> Clairol Shimmer Light Shampoo helps take the yellow out of color treated blonde and naturally gray hair. It works well in toning down unwanted brassiness and lathers really well. You can use it alone or along with the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Meets expectations; satisfactory product</li>
    <li> Smells awful. Doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> great for all blondes! Use it 1-2 a week</li>
    <li> smells great, lathers up well, and you can fell the conditioner after you rinse. also there is as it says a shimmer in your hair. my hair is gray and shimmer lights keeps it bright&#x27; i will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo that I would recommend for blondes, highlighted or dyed.&lt;br /&gt;It combats brassiness and keeps blonde tones looking like you just came out of the salon. I have tried other \\&quot;purple\\&quot; shampoos and none give the results that Clairol Shimmer Lights does!</li>
    <li> I have a mix of silver/gray hair and I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple years now and love it.</li>
    <li> I use this kind of shampoo to keep the brassy or orange tones down with my brown to red hair. It works, but the scent is too unpleasant for me to use regularly. I&#x27;m giving it a 3 because I feel it does what it&#x27;s designed for and maybe the scent would be different to someone else. I did not see a smaller size, but if there is, please, try it first to see if you like the scent.</li>
    <li> i loveeeee itt, its awesome , and works greattt , i will definitely order again,  it removed the yellow out of my hair and turned it platinum:)</li>
    <li> This product definitely gets rid of the yellow cast that forms on my gray hair. I have used several products like this and only one performed better: Nexxus Simply Silver (but it is not available any longer). For the price I think this is a decent product. I know some reviewer complained about the scent, but I do not find it offensive.  I think it smells like any other purple based shampoo. I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Disappointed...Did not live up to the expectations,  Not as good as other shampoos as far as creating shine. so so</li>
    <li> Works great to remove brassy tones and add a more neutral shade to hair</li>
    <li> Product worked as described.  It was able to brighten my hair and smelled fantastic.</li>
    <li> This shampoo will quicly take any reddish or golden highlights out of your hair if you want it out.  It will give blonde hair ash highlights over time.  Sometimes, though, I do stop using it for a few days because rather than being referred to as a  blonde I am referred to as having white hair, LOL.. I do love the effects.</li>
    <li> But I ordered the wrong container.  It was too large so I gave it to my hair dresser to use in her shop.</li>
