    <li> I just bought this acrylic lipstick holder. It is perfect for all my Baby Lips and lip glosses (I&#x27;m not big on lipsticks). It&#x27;s very sturdy and really helps with space saving. However save yourself the money, I got it at Marshall&#x27;s today for $2.99. Anytime I want to buy a makeup organizer on Amazon I check Marshall&#x27;s first, they always have them much cheaper :).</li>
    <li> Love it got it early and I still use it. It&#x27;s great if your just starting a lip stick collection.</li>
