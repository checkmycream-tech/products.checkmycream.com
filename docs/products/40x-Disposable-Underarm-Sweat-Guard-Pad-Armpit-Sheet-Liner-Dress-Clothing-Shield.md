### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>great price!</li>
      <li>These disposable underarm guards are great!</li>
      <li>Probably not the best for woman&#x27;s satin, silk or any shiny fabric blouse.</li>
      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>Amazon your better than that!!!!!</li>
      <li>Turning your shirt inside out is best.</li>
      <li>It would be great to not have to worry about embarrassing pitstains.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great, it does the job</li>
      <li>and they were great.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;d end up sweating out the sides of them, though they&#x27;re also a great product that I&#x27;ve used a lot until I found these sweat guard pads.</li>
      <li>These pads stick great to cotton shirts.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that panty liners work just as good</li>
      <li>I know it&#x27;s good in the sense that it won&#x27;t leave residue on your clothes, but just a tad stickier</li>
      <li>Which is good for not leaving a residue.</li>
      <li>I bought these because it seemed like a good deal for the price.  </li>
      <li>They &amp;#34; work&amp;#34; but are not as good as others I have purchased on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>but good product.</li>
      <li>Great underarm guard to give another layer of protection just to be safe if you sweat.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be great.</li>
      <li>We LOVE this!  </li>
      <li>Still though, the first shipment I got was the best.  </li>
      <li>stars is because the idea is noble.</li>
      <li>These attach the underside of your shirt and nicely absorb the sweat.</li>
      <li>good thing is that they prevent my clothing from getting soiled, and leave me feeling a bit more confident.</li>
      <li>but they&#x27;re still pretty great.</li>
      <li>I have a more serve issue.</li>
      <li>My body produces more sweat than anyone I&#x27;ve ever known.  </li>
      <li>I would buy again as these are better than nothing at all.</li>
      <li>these did not work, they did not stick to the clothing well and were more hassle than help.  </li>
      <li>I found that they give me much better absorption if I put two under each arm.  </li>
      <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t notice it when it happened.</li>
      <li>How can you make a product for this purpose, and not have tested to make sure they work??</li>
      <li>It was more noticeable than if hadn&#x27;t been wearing them.  </li>
      <li>While the pads do keep the wetness away from my tops, I find myself having to find creative ways of keeping the from falling off, as the adhesive does not stick to all fabrics.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure others might.</li>
      <li>They fall off at the most inopportune times.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried multiple types of sweat guard pads and these ones are the best.</li>
      <li>Could be better made.</li>
      <li>giving it an OK for now...tried to use them twice</li>
      <li>Sometimes the top layer falls off and drops out of clothing while wearing.</li>
      <li>Love them and hope they stay in stock forever.</li>
      <li>Make sure the check which country they are shipping from if you still decide to buy them even though I&#x27;m warning you they won&#x27;t adhere to your clothes.</li>
      <li>Works pretty good</li>
      <li>These work great for me and it would be even better if a larger size was available</li>
      <li>The adhesive is secure but yet at the end of the day it is easy to remove.</li>
      <li>(works best on tight t-shirts, I wear them under a work uniform or sweater, ect.).</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and will order them again.</li>
      <li>These would work great if they actually stuck to your shirt.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, I already have fabric tape in the house.</li>
      <li>just ordered two more months worth.</li>
      <li>Great, saved my life numerous times.</li>
      <li>These pads fit well</li>
      <li>Cheaply made and leave a plastic smell from the adhesive.  </li>
      <li>Good to have in professional or formal situations.</li>
      <li>Price is worth it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased sweat pads from various sites and so far this one is the best.</li>
      <li>I wish the product was more consistent, but it&#x27;s not bad for the price.  </li>
      <li>These come in perfect little wrapped packages, actually better than the ones I had in Japan because they&#x27;re bigger and they stick to my shirts better</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly and looks like the liners should work.</li>
      <li>is for people with mild issues.</li>
      <li>the sticks isn&#x27;t sticky enough but it does a pretty good job</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars because the adhesive isn&#x27;t really that strong.</li>
      <li>They blocked the sweat and barely absorbed anything.  </li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
      <li>So far, they have done a good job of absorbing the majority of the sweat, they are easy to put on, and they stay in place for the entire shift.</li>
      <li>They arrived right on time.</li>
      <li>I sweated right over the pad area.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>But I can&#x27;t complain because you get so many for the low price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve decided to order again in hopes that the next shipment will be more like the first.  </li>
      <li>These are exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>I wish they would be bigger size and better shape.</li>
      <li>bought these for my daughters, but since it&#x27;s been breaking heat spell here they are only wearing tank tops, but I&#x27;ve used these and have saved many tops.</li>
      <li>so it gets hot a bit quicker.</li>
      <li>This is the first of a disposable sweat guard armpit pad I have ever used.</li>
      <li>/&gt;To be fair, they would probably be okay for a woman or someone who only has small sweat stains in the cracks of their armpits;  </li>
      <li>delivered pretty fast but item doesn&#x27;t work too well</li>
      <li>This worked much better for me, and once I cooled off after a walk, I could remove them and let them dry, keeping the odor to a minimum.</li>
      <li>They adhere fine and are absorbent enough for my needs.  </li>
      <li>Tried to this brand for the first time and they work better than the other brand I have ordered for years.</li>
      <li>These things work amazingly well on my cotton work shirts, which are usually the first to go.  </li>
      <li>Even though I don&#x27;t sweat so much, I found myself having to change sweat guards between shifts, which I don&#x27;t mind so much</li>
      <li>They work well, but don&#x27;t stay in place very well.</li>
      <li>However, they don&#x27;t really stay in place for me.</li>
      <li>If the shirt is white or a light color, you&#x27;re boned.</li>
      <li>Works well sometimes, others not so much.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really a curse.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t stick very well.</li>
      <li>After several hours, the adhesive pulls away from the fabric (I mostly wear T-shirts, and because they&#x27;re stretchy, they pull away from the adhesive with natural movement).</li>
      <li>But, for button up long sleeve blouses worked fine if placed in the correct position.</li>
      <li>They can be easily repositioned, one side at a time, if you mess up the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has no capability to stick to anything except itself, and it&#x27;s odd shape makes fitting it a chore.</li>
      <li>I bought them to wear to an interview because you know how the underarm waterworks go when one is particularly nervous.</li>
      <li>, they are visible through light fabrics, but that&#x27;s expected, so I won&#x27;t complain much about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It works a little better if I put two on one side</li>
      <li>Any sort of sweat pad stays in better if you safety pin them in, just a little tip.</li>
      <li>They are smaller and do not always stick very well and tend to fall out the first time you wear them.</li>
      <li>you place them, keep in mind where you normally sweat.</li>
      <li>If you have hyperhidrosis, or just episodic sweating when you get nervous or flush, this keeps your underarms cool and dry.  </li>
      <li>I can wear a tank or shell under a suit coat and this keeps the suit fresh without taking to the dry cleaner</li>
      <li>I was really looking forward to these, as I sweat a lot, especially while presenting.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They work well, but don&#x27;t stay in place very well.</li>
    <li> Does not stick too well to the fabric.</li>
    <li> These pads fit well but the glue is not strong enough to adhere to fabric.</li>
    <li> These pads are not functional at all, they always either move or come off during the day. It works a little better if I put two on one side but it&#x27;s not what I was looking for. I wish they would be bigger size and better shape. Will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good the sticks isn&#x27;t sticky enough but it does a pretty good job</li>
    <li> This thing sucked. Was so uncomfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> hard to use without wrinkling shirt</li>
    <li> I was excited about the idea of these, as in the summer I have a hard time cooling down after a workout. It would be great to not have to worry about embarrassing pitstains. These attach the underside of your shirt and nicely absorb the sweat. The issue is that the ink in the pads can leak through into your shirt. If the shirt is white or a light color, you&#x27;re boned. You need these less for dark shirts anyway, so they are somewhat pointless.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve started taking long, brisk walks at work and found that by the end of the day I smell terrible, so I decided to try this product. These are not working well for me. To start, I have to use two per armpit just to get the coverage I need. After several hours, the adhesive pulls away from the fabric (I mostly wear T-shirts, and because they&#x27;re stretchy, they pull away from the adhesive with natural movement). And since I have an allergy to many adhesives, they are irritating my armpits. Before ordering these, I was doubling up lint-free task wipers (http://www.amazon.com/Kimberly-Clark-34705-Kimwipes-Delicate-Disposable/dp/B0040ZOF8O/ref&#x3D;sr_1_8?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1424389004&amp;sr&#x3D;8-8&amp;keywords&#x3D;kimwipes), folding them in half twice, and putting them partially under my bra to hold them in place. This worked much better for me, and once I cooled off after a walk, I could remove them and let them dry, keeping the odor to a minimum. I&#x27;m going back to this method.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my suit jackets and they fell off after 1 hour.  Cheaply made and leave a plastic smell from the adhesive.  I would never recommend.  Totally unsatisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I sweat like a pig.  My body produces more sweat than anyone I&#x27;ve ever known.  It&#x27;s really a curse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these from the same seller a few months ago and they were great.  They were thick and really absorbed a lot of sweat.  The old ones helped.  They didn&#x27;t block the sweat stains but they kept it from dripping all the way down the sides of my shirt.  These new ones are completely different.  They blocked the sweat and barely absorbed anything.  Instead of having pit stains I had a dry shirt around my armpits and sweat all around them.  It was more noticeable than if hadn&#x27;t been wearing them.  They are useless for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, they would probably be okay for a woman or someone who only has small sweat stains in the cracks of their armpits;  But they are useless for someone with a real sweating problem.  It&#x27;s to bad because I was really satisfied with the old product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping took a while both times.  I think they come from Hong Kong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After tying another brand, I am changing my review from one star to three stars.  I wish the product was more consistent, but it&#x27;s not bad for the price.  I found that they give me much better absorption if I put two under each arm.  Still though, the first shipment I got was the best.  I&#x27;ve decided to order again in hopes that the next shipment will be more like the first.  I was just very disappointed with the second shipment because were much less absorbent than the first.  I also noticed that they threw in two extra pairs.  I don&#x27;t know if this was a mistake or intentional.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my dress shirts. They simply do not hold, it was a waste of money. You place them on the inside and by the time you get to work you already feel them gone. The glue on the pads is poor quality and will not stick to men&#x27;s long sleeve button-up shirts.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve bought these in the past and they worked great, but now they won&#x27;t stick to clothes at all - very disappointed in product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple types of sweat guard pads and these ones are the best. Wish they were a bit wider but they&#x27;re still pretty great. Other sweat pads like the kleinart ones are bigger but aren&#x27;t waterproof like these ones. I&#x27;ve also tried the Purax pads that you adhere to your armpit but those were too small and I&#x27;d end up sweating out the sides of them, though they&#x27;re also a great product that I&#x27;ve used a lot until I found these sweat guard pads. They ship from Hong Kong and take about a week or so to arrive so I always order in advance to have a little stockpile. Love them and hope they stay in stock forever.</li>
    <li> giving it an OK for now...tried to use them twice but they did  not stay on where placed.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t stick very well. They fall off at the most inopportune times. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Terrible product.  They don&#x27;t stay in place at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased sweat pads from various sites and so far this one is the best. You get a lot for the price, but they take a while to get here. It does say that it can take up to 20 days to get here which is a long time to wait if you need them. I&#x27;ve found that panty liners work just as good and they&#x27;re a lot cheaper. Any sort of sweat pad stays in better if you safety pin them in, just a little tip.</li>
    <li> The pads themselves aren&#x27;t too bad and they will keep the area dry. For some people they might be a little small and not cover the whole area, but it was fine for me. I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars because the adhesive isn&#x27;t really that strong. I know it&#x27;s good in the sense that it won&#x27;t leave residue on your clothes, but just a tad stickier would have been better because it feels like it can slide around a little and might come loose during the day. But I can&#x27;t complain because you get so many for the low price. I ended up using Sweat Block and don&#x27;t even need these anymore, but they aren&#x27;t that bad.</li>
    <li> These would work great if they actually stuck to your shirt. I&#x27;ve tried them on several different fabrics and they don&#x27;t stick to any of them.</li>
    <li> I can wear a tank or shell under a suit coat and this keeps the suit fresh without taking to the dry cleaner</li>
    <li> I have trouble getting these to actually stick and stay under there. I bought them to wear to an interview because you know how the underarm waterworks go when one is particularly nervous. As I walked out, one was down to my wrist and the other I still don&#x27;t know were i lost it.  So i am back to roll-ons and spray anti-pespirants:)&lt;br /&gt;Two stars is because the idea is noble.</li>
    <li> We LOVE this!  If you have hyperhidrosis, or just episodic sweating when you get nervous or flush, this keeps your underarms cool and dry.  Nobody else needs to know that you just had a sweaty moment (-:</li>
    <li> Works great! Kinda like slim and sleek sticky maxi pad for your armpit. I used the advice earlier of turning the shirt inside out and applying that way. Probably not the best for woman&#x27;s satin, silk or any shiny fabric blouse. Sticky surface is not super sticky. Which is good for not leaving a residue.</li>
    <li> They adhere fine and are absorbent enough for my needs.  I wear with darker color shirts, cotton and other fabrics.  Price is worth it!</li>
    <li> Awful!!!! Not worth even using them.. All forty are individually wrapped then you open it and there&#x27;s nothing to them.. Amazon your better than that!!!!!</li>
    <li> They are a little tricky to get the hang of, and I hate that they are made in China. However they work!</li>
    <li> This item was purchased as a gift. It arrived quickly and looks like the liners should work.</li>
    <li> Great underarm guard to give another layer of protection just to be safe if you sweat. Good to have in professional or formal situations.</li>
    <li> I bought these because it seemed like a good deal for the price.  They are rather small and I will have to use two of them.  I will not be reordering these.</li>
    <li> These things did not stay in place!</li>
    <li> Could be better made. Sometimes the top layer falls off and drops out of clothing while wearing.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t stick to clothing at all. Fall off after few minutes. Waste of money and effort.</li>
    <li> Great, saved my life numerous times. I will order again</li>
    <li> They do not stick to my clothing..was humiliated to find one that had dropped out of my dress onto the floor!</li>
    <li> Poor quality... money wasted</li>
    <li> Sticks to a polo shirt. Was not large enough for me. I sweated right over the pad area.&lt;br /&gt;This is for people with mild issues. I have a more serve issue.</li>
    <li> These work great for me and it would be even better if a larger size was available so my husband could use them too.</li>
    <li> sorry, but I could not get them to stick to my cotton undershirts, and all they ever did was fall off and slither down my side.</li>
    <li> I have used various brands of disposable and reusable shields. These don&#x27;t stick well. Sometimes they don&#x27;t stick to the fabric at all. Other times they&#x27;ll barely stick and move out of place as you put your shirt on. And I&#x27;ve even lost one during the day. Glad I didn&#x27;t notice it when it happened. I would have been mortified to have one of these tumbling out from under my shirt in front of someone. Fortunately, I already have fabric tape in the house. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been using, but this is a pain. Just to compare, the Kleinert shields stay on even after being put in the wash accidentally. Also, I think these are just a tad too small and don&#x27;t quite cover enough surface.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed.  They do not stick well nor stay in place.</li>
    <li> Not impressed theses aren&#x27;t very big and didn&#x27;t stick well. They also didn&#x27;t last very long.  I Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> They do not stay on your clothing. They stay put for a total of ten minutes before they start moving around.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Tried to this brand for the first time and they work better than the other brand I have ordered for years. These come off my shirts with ease and do not leave a mess like the other brand. I recommend this product to those who work outside with the public. They keep your shirts dry and you do not get that sweat and deodorant build up.</li>
    <li> I used to buy something similar to this in Japan and I didn&#x27;t think they had anything like these in the states, but alas, amazon has everything you could ever want. These come in perfect little wrapped packages, actually better than the ones I had in Japan because they&#x27;re bigger and they stick to my shirts better (works best on tight t-shirts, I wear them under a work uniform or sweater, ect.). I sweat a lot unfortunately, but these help! We&#x27;ll have to see how these work in the summer but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be great. Only complaint is that there&#x27;s not a lot of airflow so it gets hot a bit quicker. Other than that I recommend this!</li>
    <li> Guys wear shirts that are made of cotton. We don&#x27;t wear clothing that is ever referred to as a blouse and is made of silk. These pads stick great to cotton shirts. I wear polo&#x27;s and long sleeve woven shirts. Turning your shirt inside out is best. The worst part is positioning them, but just stick on one side of the pad at a time, remove the other cover once the first side is done. They can be easily repositioned, one side at a time, if you mess up the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you place them, keep in mind where you normally sweat. They should not be centered on the sleeve, but slightly forward of the sleeve seem. *Also, if you forget and accidentally put your shirt shirt on before the sweat guards, your deodorant that rubs off might prevent them from sticking properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to save your work shirts for $11 a month, and no longer smell that after work funk that is tough to wash out of your shirts, Get these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered two more months worth. I might give them out as stocking stuffers.</li>
    <li> The pads did not stick..and unlike the picture - if you are wearing a white shirt you can see them thru the shirt</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I needed larger and thicker pads for my 6-foot tall son. These are for women, not men.</li>
    <li> Seem to work well for my suit jackets. Wish they were a little larger- but good product.</li>
    <li> These disposable underarm guards are great! Wish I&#x27;d had them years ago!</li>
    <li> This is the first of a disposable sweat guard armpit pad I have ever used. For pull over long sleeve shirts, the pads crumpled up and were unwearable. But, for button up long sleeve blouses worked fine if placed in the correct position. But u must still be careful or else the pad will also crumple up. It does the job &amp; keeps wet arm pit stains off of the shirt.</li>
    <li> bought these for my daughters, but since it&#x27;s been breaking heat spell here they are only wearing tank tops, but I&#x27;ve used these and have saved many tops.</li>
    <li> While the pads do keep the wetness away from my tops, I find myself having to find creative ways of keeping the from falling off, as the adhesive does not stick to all fabrics.  Ordinarily, I don&#x27;t feel comfortable unless I tack them on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, they are visible through light fabrics, but that&#x27;s expected, so I won&#x27;t complain much about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good thing is that they prevent my clothing from getting soiled, and leave me feeling a bit more confident. I would buy again as these are better than nothing at all.</li>
    <li> Must have for every woman and fashion stylist! great price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other sweat guards.  The adhesive is secure but yet at the end of the day it is easy to remove.</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to these, as I sweat a lot, especially while presenting. However, they don&#x27;t really stay in place for me. It&#x27;s a bigger hassle to use them than to just add a tissue under there and throw it out. It might work for some people though. I guess it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> I like these, they are a little small, compared to other ones. Sometimes I have to double up. I do like that they actually come in bulkier quantity and not just 12 or 8</li>
    <li> This product is terrible. It has no capability to stick to anything except itself, and it&#x27;s odd shape makes fitting it a chore. Of course because it does not adhere to the fabric (I&#x27;ve tried several different types of fabric), it make the use of trying to guard the sweating useless. I tried using a safety pin to hold it in place but the liner still bunched up and eventually stuck to itself in different areas. I just ended up taking them off. Really a terrible experience. Additionally, I ordered these on Dec 14th, and did not receive them for almost two weeks. Make sure the check which country they are shipping from if you still decide to buy them even though I&#x27;m warning you they won&#x27;t adhere to your clothes. I will have to try a different product and will pay attention to whether the item sticks to the clothes.</li>
    <li> This items job has one purpose, to stick to your shirt so you don&#x27;t sweat all over it. It fails miserably. They don&#x27;t stick what so ever. All of my shirts are 100% cotton from express. How can you make a product for this purpose, and not have tested to make sure they work?? So frustrating.</li>
    <li> They &amp;#34; work&amp;#34; but are not as good as others I have purchased on Amazon.  They are smaller and do not always stick very well and tend to fall out the first time you wear them.</li>
    <li> These are the second brand/type of disposable underarm sweat guards I have used and I like them. I&#x27;m a waitress and have to wear white shirts every day so I wanted something to prevent pit/sweat stains. So far, they have done a good job of absorbing the majority of the sweat, they are easy to put on, and they stay in place for the entire shift. However, I sweat a mild-moderate amount; I don&#x27;t think this will work well enough for someone who sweats heavily. Even though I don&#x27;t sweat so much, I found myself having to change sweat guards between shifts, which I don&#x27;t mind so much but I&#x27;m sure others might. Overall I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and will order them again.</li>
    <li> these did not work, they did not stick to the clothing well and were more hassle than help.  they ended up in the trash</li>
    <li> Does not stay in place well.</li>
    <li> Hated these, threw them in the trash immediately after trying to use them. Went through 5 just to get them to stick. They don&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> Works well sometimes, others not so much. Often leaves sticky adhesive residue on &amp;#34;silkier&amp;#34; type clothing, but it comes off with some careful scratching. It does keep wet spots off though, and are thin, not noisy/crinkly, and not awkward feeling.</li>
    <li> I sweat a lot but other people don&#x27;t need to know this!!! It&#x27;s great, it does the job and I don&#x27;t get those embarrassing stain under my armpits</li>
    <li> These are exactly what I was looking for.  They arrived right on time.</li>
    <li> delivered pretty fast but item doesn&#x27;t work too well</li>
    <li> These things work amazingly well on my cotton work shirts, which are usually the first to go.  It&#x27;s other fabrics that cause issue; it doesn&#x27;t really stay put for other materials or you can see them through the shirt!  I pick and choose when to use them.</li>
