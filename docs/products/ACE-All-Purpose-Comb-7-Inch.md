      <li>Retro or not, this is an ideal comb.</li>
      <li>recommend it for people with good amount of hair.</li>
      <li>Had this for ages now and still no stretching, breaking or bending of any kind.</li>
      <li>great product but not yet tested, thanks.</li>
      <li>This comb may work out fine, but it isn&#x27;t what I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>and it worked fine.</li>
      <li>Cheap tool.</li>
      <li>cheap plastic becomes brittle when exposed to solvents</li>
      <li>The original combs can be identified with a indentation in the body of the comb.</li>
      <li>Then I decided to clean it using nailpolish remover.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worthy the price.</li>
      <li>I love the taper and it is great for my 18 month old boy&#x27;s hair and great for cutting!</li>
      <li>Nothing special, but it certainly works.  </li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s exactly what it is.  </li>
      <li>Ace combs and I go back many decades.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>So to keep your hair and scalp healthy, wash your comb regularly with a decent shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So to keep your hair and scalp healthy, wash your comb regularly with a decent shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Large teeth have been braking off since day one.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a smart comb for travel</li>
      <li>/&gt;While I was waiting for my original order to arrive, curiosity about the origins of combs made look up the history of these simple gadgets that we take for granted until they break.</li>
      <li>It can comb fine for people with little hair (or no hair :) ) but people with full hair, can&#x27;t comb it because it can&#x27;t touch down to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
      <li>This appears to be made of a different material, shinier and more plastic looking, or at least a lower quality hard rubber, and has a thinner and straighter spine more like the barber&#x27;s comb than the old original ACE combs that I have.  </li>
      <li>The comb is very good, especially when it is used for cutting the hair.</li>
      <li>As early as 5500 B.C.</li>
      <li>As early as 5500 B.C.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fine, solid black comb with two sizes of spine.  </li>
      <li>What can I say, the ACE comb is a standard that other combs aspire to.&lt;br /&gt;Stick with the original, they have earned it.</li>
      <li>This is not the original rubber ACE comb made of hard rubber with a gentle curve to the spine (See upper comb in photo).  </li>
      <li>And this was specifically the one that I had been looking for, the personal flashback model, the one with half regular and half fine teeth, the kind that I had used years ago yet seem to be missing from the drugstore shelves and racks today.  </li>
      <li>You can no longer comb your hair with it, as you&#x27;ll likely as not leave strange patterns on your head, depending on how many teeth are missing.  </li>
      <li>, but I had been looking for the old, original black hard rubber comb that I had remembered from earlier times, the one with about 65 fine teeth and around 35 regular teeth.  </li>
      <li>hope that you found this bit of trivia about the humble comb to be interesting if not enlightening.</li>

    <li> Perfect comb that doesn&#x27;t break.</li>
    <li> Cheap tool. Large teeth have been braking off since day one. Do not recommend this comb.</li>
    <li> I love the taper and it is great for my 18 month old boy&#x27;s hair and great for cutting! Thanks!</li>

I feel like an expert on this, as many of the combs that I&#x27;ve bought over the past few years have ended up this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding the [[ASIN:B000172R58 ACE Combs All Purpose 7\\&quot; Comb]] here was just a matter of chance when I was looking for something else entirely unrelated.  It was sitting there in the \\&quot;Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought\\&quot; just below the CR2032 Lithium-ion batteries that I had been considering, and yet it was quite coincidental because YADC (Yet Another Drugstore Comb) had broken a few days before.  And this was specifically the one that I had been looking for, the personal flashback model, the one with half regular and half fine teeth, the kind that I had used years ago yet seem to be missing from the drugstore shelves and racks today.  I grabbed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could have bought the [[ASIN:B000FJ4AWK ACE All Purpose Mock Turtle Finish Comb]], but I had been looking for the old, original black hard rubber comb that I had remembered from earlier times, the one with about 65 fine teeth and around 35 regular teeth.  And when it arrived I checked it out and that&#x27;s exactly what it is.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s still made of hard rubber anymore, but it didn&#x27;t snap when I flexed it, so I have no complaints so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are prone to losing them, there&#x27;s also the [[ASIN:B005I03CA2 ACE Comb, 7\\&quot;All Purpose  (Pack of 3)]], which may be confusing as the product specs say \\&quot;1 Piece count,\\&quot; but it&#x27;s a pack of three of these as reviewed above, just from a different distributor at the time of this writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was waiting for my original order to arrive, curiosity about the origins of combs made look up the history of these simple gadgets that we take for granted until they break. They&#x27;re among the oldest tools found by archaeologists. As early as 5500 B.C. the ancient Egyptians carved out combs, and in ancient China, they were worn as hair accessories that reflected one&#x27;s social status.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combs have been discovered in very various forms from settlements dating back to 5,000 years ago in Persia. In their earliest forms, combs were carved from wood and sometimes from bone. Tortoiseshell and ivory were common high-fashion combs, but concerns for animals&#x27; rights shifted to predominantly wooden, hard rubber and plastic combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are said to be three types of combs; functional hair combs, decorative combs and flea combs. Regular hair combs are used to style and maintain ones hair. Decorative combs are meant to dress up the hair, and serve absolutely no purpose in taking care of your hair. Flea combs are used to search for tiny parasites like fleas, lice or crabs. And do note that sharing combs is not recommended, as that&#x27;s a common method of transmitting fleas, crabs, lice and even infections. So to keep your hair and scalp healthy, wash your comb regularly with a decent shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that you found this bit of trivia about the humble comb to be interesting if not enlightening.

    <li> I was using this for a while and it worked fine. Then I decided to clean it using nailpolish remover. I&#x27;ve done this before with other combs but with this comb, the bristles became soft in the bath. Later they became brittle and began to snap off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tl;dr: cheap plastic becomes brittle when exposed to solvents</li>
    <li> great product but not yet tested, thanks.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a comb. What can I say?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fine, solid black comb with two sizes of spine.  Nothing special, but it certainly works.  Seems like it&#x27;ll hold up.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a travel comb so its only used 10 times a year maybe. its cheap, it works, and it hasn&#x27;t broken. What else can you ask for?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a comb so not much to expect, I don&#x27;t know why people say it&#x27;s rubber cause the one I received to my knowledge is plastic, or at least the feel of it is. I thought it would be a fatter style of comb, but it&#x27;s a thin comb so that&#x27;s my warning to you if you&#x27;re looking for a bigger comb.</li>
    <li> Ace combs and I go back many decades. They have a new mold in the last few years. The original combs can be identified with a indentation in the body of the comb.</li>
    <li> I have always had an Ace comb. I got this comb with a gift certificate and prefer the rubber base to plastic that is used in most combs.</li>
    <li> This is not the original rubber ACE comb made of hard rubber with a gentle curve to the spine (See upper comb in photo).
