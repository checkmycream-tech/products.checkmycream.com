    <li> Have used it for yrs ,and like the product,just not the rising cost...</li>
    <li> Excellent product often hard to find.</li>
    <li> I bought one at a salon, but this one has a minty smell to it that I do not like.  Ahhh  NEW &amp; IMPROVED, I guess.</li>
    <li> I have very dry, thin, sort of wavy hair and all this did was make my hair much more frizzy</li>
    <li> Love this product, makes hair feel thick.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> I was using several different products to help with my thinning hair.  My stylist gave me a sample of this and it worked wonders!  Just a dab of this (my hair is short) and my hair looks thicker and it gives it a nice shine.  Now, instead of buying 2 or 3 different products, this is the only thing I use.</li>
