### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I used the derby DE blades and they worked out perfect for me.</li>
      <li>The plastic inserts are perhaps a turn-off for some, but I find it a great solution for loading and cleaning!!!</li>
      <li>Absolutely wonderful!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know which blades would be the best or how to get the blade to stick in the holder.  </li>
      <li>Great purchase!</li>
      <li>A perfect starter razor for anyone looking to give it a shot, but dont want to go all in with the investment.</li>
      <li>This handle is great.  </li>
      <li>Happy I went with this.  </li>
      <li>I think its a great balance.</li>
      <li>The angle is perfect and the shave is smooth.</li>
      <li>Good for learning to use this typer of razor.</li>
      <li>All said, it is a good product for the money.</li>
      <li>this good for beginners?</li>
      <li>I love shaving!  </li>
      <li>First shave was awesome.</li>
      <li>This item showed up promptly and well packaged, it was exactly as it was described and was perfect as a beginner shavette.  </li>
      <li>I love this shavette!</li>
      <li>This is an excellent beginner&#x27;s straight razor, or just for someone who does not get a kick out of the ceremony of stropping.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight (heavier is nice when it comes to using the razor&#x27;s weight to shave)&lt;br /&gt;Plastic blade holder</li>
      <li>I purchased this product because I liked the idea of the metal handle; I didn&#x27;t want to spend $30+ on an all-plastic razor.</li>
      <li>I gave it 4 out of 5 because the plastic inserts that hold the blade in place seem very cheaply made</li>
      <li>This will save you lots of money and give better results than any razor out there.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t know how durable the plastic hinge on the holders are but seem like they would still be able to be used even if the hinge broke.</li>
      <li>Will continue using it while eyeballing a better one.</li>
      <li>The inside casing is plastic and it came with shark razor blades that don&#x27;t even fit in this razor!</li>
      <li>Cheap razor!</li>
      <li>Use the counter top to push the blade holder insert out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just glad I no longer have to use it.</li>
      <li>I love this razor for line ups</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s perfect for the beginner or even daily user.</li>
      <li>On the bright side they got it out pretty quickly!!</li>
      <li>The Dovo is ok but the shavette is to light .</li>
      <li>The plastic incert holds the blade easily and it doe shave, but I wouldn&#x27;t degrade a razor over Paci steel.</li>
      <li>The blade is exceptionally easy to change (although I wonder about the longevity of the plastic blade holder) and the razor can take the half-double-edge blades or the longer personna-type blades.</li>
      <li>It is also very light, with a good balance and is easily maneuverable for the different positions required to shave the face.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean, requires no maintenance, and the razors can be purchased for cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line: If you are going to go the straight razor route for shaving, this item and a pack of razors are effective, efficient and cheap.</li>
      <li>But after that, smooth sailing.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit light</li>
      <li>So far so good....</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not even worth $10!</li>
      <li>but i&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
      <li>Shaves pretty smooth!</li>
      <li>Fun and frugal!  </li>
      <li>I do recommend that you clean it, as hair and cream will get up into the plastic blade holder.</li>
      <li>Once you get the technique down it is a very cost effective way to get a great shave.</li>
      <li>I should have read the product reviews about the blades that they say to pair with it because they are not the right size!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a much better shave, very close shave,</li>
      <li>I have discovered straight razors contain blood magic.</li>
      <li>I am purchasing a stainless model in hopes it will weigh more .</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure a straight razor is heavier but the girth works for me.</li>
      <li>It has quickly become one of the highlights of my day.</li>
      <li>a great starting place before jumping to a straight razor.</li>
      <li>Super close shave and haven&#x27;t cut myself yet</li>
      <li>and that your doing it right but trust me, properly made lather has a huge impact on your shaving experience; it actually made some of my not so great blades feel much better.</li>
      <li>The metal construction gives it a good weight in your hand and the fact that it takes disposable blades is a huge plus if you don&#x27;t want to worry about sharpening a traditional straight razor.  </li>
      <li>100 shark super stainless pack is a good deal, and I will never go back to the 5 blade face pullers.</li>
      <li>Way to light, a straight razor should have some substance, some weight to it, the weight of the razor should do the work, with this razor</li>
      <li>The product is lightweight and feels cheaper than a real straight razor, but it is what it is.</li>
      <li>This razor was amazing not only for the price but for the shave.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth the switch.</li>
      <li>but if I were a barber and needed to shave and cut hair with a razor I could see how practical and useful this device would be.</li>
      <li>The blades it comes with are garbage but the razor itself is light and fits decently in your hand without sliding.</li>
      <li>It takes some time to learn to close the blade in easily, but is easily done after you clean it a few times.</li>
      <li>Getting your face nice and hot, the whiskers soft and wet and a good lather is the key.</li>
      <li>After some experimenting I found that I like the half blades and that they are very easy to change out and to clean the insert.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really not as difficult as some make it seem.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had good success shaving with it using a split double edge razor (Red holder).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not going to lie, when I first got this handle, I had no clue how to use it.  </li>
      <li>I can tell by different qualities of disposable single edges, that a real straight edge would be much better, however I wanted to make sure this is something I can stick with</li>
      <li>I then contacted Dovo saying that I didn&#x27;t think it was fair that I paid the extra money for a metal razor only to receive a plastic one.</li>
      <li>This is my first shavette, and I&#x27;m an encyclopedia definition BEGINNER, but I must say, I really like the way this handles and how it operates.</li>
      <li>Long cut&#x27;s magically appear about 5 minutes after you stopped shaving the area.</li>
      <li>The red holder makes it easy to see where the blade is.</li>
      <li>and I certainly don&#x27;t have the skill to handle large areas in one scoop.</li>
      <li>This razor is a good one to learn on it is not that expensive and relatively easy to use.</li>
      <li>One last thing is that the blade holder seems very durable, but in the event that the holder breaks in two at the joint, it will still work just as well as it did before because it is securely held in place by the shavette body.</li>
      <li>They were offering to send one of a different color and with a box of 100 free razor blades (even though I had already purchased a pack of 100).</li>
      <li>I purchased this Shavette as an introduction to straight shaving.</li>
      <li>Inexpensive introduction to straight razors.</li>
      <li>I wanted to get into straight shaving my head.</li>
      <li>I also have a Boker straight razor, but I will use the Dovo shavette when I don&#x27;t feel like stropping the Boker.</li>
      <li>Would defintely recommend for anyone just beginning to shave with a straight razor.</li>
      <li>When I decided to go with a straight razor I almost went with the one you have to sharpen -</li>
      <li>I purchased this product from Straight Razor Designs.</li>
      <li>Bought this razor to try shaving with a straight razor before putting a lot of money out.  </li>
      <li>I did some research and found out that this item houses disposable, 1-time use straight razors, and it has been a blessing.</li>
      <li>This is a very durable piece of equipment.</li>
      <li>About the same price, but they have a detailed description of the product and what to expect from using the product.</li>
      <li>Bought this razor a few months ago because I was too lazy to figure out how to sharpen a legitimate straight razor and let me tell you, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
      <li>but I wanted to try a straight razor without all the high maintenance of stropping and honing.</li>
      <li>3 stars because it seems decently made but just not what I wanted.</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t compare the Shavette to a fixed blade straight razor</li>
      <li>Clean and dry the blade and holder after every shave.</li>
      <li>I really like straight razor shaving, this is my first single blade razor.</li>
      <li>Plus the fact that you are only using a tiny strip of metal that can be tossed when it is no longer sharp, is an added bonus and good news for the environment.</li>
      <li>However, they do fit in the Red insert, just smaller than the blades that come with the razor.</li>
      <li>Okay so I switched from the lazy man shave to the</li>
      <li>Came on time wasn&#x27;t missing anything work just fine..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good for learning to use this typer of razor. The red holder makes it easy to see where the blade is. The blades that come with the razor don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> This is my first shavette, and I&#x27;m an encyclopedia definition BEGINNER, but I must say, I really like the way this handles and how it operates. The plastic inserts are perhaps a turn-off for some, but I find it a great solution for loading and cleaning!!!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent beginner&#x27;s straight razor, or just for someone who does not get a kick out of the ceremony of stropping. It is versatile, as you can use several different types of blades, if you have the correct plastic insert. It is also very light, with a good balance and is easily maneuverable for the different positions required to shave the face. Plus the fact that you are only using a tiny strip of metal that can be tossed when it is no longer sharp, is an added bonus and good news for the environment. I use the platinum edged blades and have never gotten a closer shave, period.</li>
    <li> Happy I went with this.  No stropping, minimal fuss, and well-built.  I don&#x27;t expect it to last a hundred years, but that&#x27;s not what I bought it for.</li>
    <li> I love this shavette! I take it in the shower with me, and it is showing no signs of rust at all. I like the sandwiching blade holder. It takes some time to learn to close the blade in easily, but is easily done after you clean it a few times. I do recommend that you clean it, as hair and cream will get up into the plastic blade holder. Clean and dry the blade and holder after every shave. One last thing is that the blade holder seems very durable, but in the event that the holder breaks in two at the joint, it will still work just as well as it did before because it is securely held in place by the shavette body. Loading the blade may be more difficult if this occurs, but the only weak point on this product will NOT prevent you from using it safely.</li>
    <li> The short razor blades &amp;#34;shark&amp;#34; that were recommended with the black and clear shavette blade guards fit well and shave great.&lt;br /&gt;The 100 shark super stainless pack is a good deal, and I will never go back to the 5 blade face pullers.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from Straight Razor Designs. About the same price, but they have a detailed description of the product and what to expect from using the product. The product comes with the red and black blade holder, but you can order the Green holder as well and all of the razor blades you might need. The product is lightweight and feels cheaper than a real straight razor, but it is what it is. I&#x27;ve had good success shaving with it using a split double edge razor (Red holder). I also have a Boker straight razor, but I will use the Dovo shavette when I don&#x27;t feel like stropping the Boker. All said, it is a good product for the money. Amazon appears to be cheaper on price now, especially if you can get Prime shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie, when I first got this handle, I had no clue how to use it.  I didn&#x27;t know which blades would be the best or how to get the blade to stick in the holder.  After some experimenting I found that I like the half blades and that they are very easy to change out and to clean the insert.  The razor is very well made and seems like it will last forever.  The metal construction gives it a good weight in your hand and the fact that it takes disposable blades is a huge plus if you don&#x27;t want to worry about sharpening a traditional straight razor.  I couldn&#x27;t imagine going back to cartridge razors after getting the hang of this.</li>
    <li> The Dovo is ok but the shavette is to light . It has very little feel while you shave . I am purchasing a stainless model in hopes it will weigh more .</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize this was just the handle. Not what I was looking for. 3 stars because it seems decently made but just not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This razor was amazing not only for the price but for the shave. It&#x27;s a bit light but i&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s how all shavettes are. I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about this razor especially for the price. Shave on people! shave on..</li>
    <li> Cheap razor! The inside casing is plastic and it came with shark razor blades that don&#x27;t even fit in this razor! Do not purchase this product it&#x27;s not even worth $10! On the bright side they got it out pretty quickly!!</li>
    <li> This was the one of the worse choice, the picture doesn&#x27;t reflect the reality this is a cheap razor and the return was a nightmare.</li>
    <li> Shipped wrong product twice not as pictured. Doesn&#x27;t come with red blade holder.</li>
    <li> When I decided to go with a straight razor I almost went with the one you have to sharpen - until I realized what a total pain it was. I did some research and found out that this item houses disposable, 1-time use straight razors, and it has been a blessing. It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean, requires no maintenance, and the razors can be purchased for cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: If you are going to go the straight razor route for shaving, this item and a pack of razors are effective, efficient and cheap.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive introduction to straight razors.</li>
    <li> But after that, smooth sailing.  You can&#x27;t get a closer shave and one pack of blades will last you a crazy amount of time.  This will save you lots of money and give better results than any razor out there.</li>
    <li> Okay so I switched from the lazy man shave to the if your a man....this is how you should shave product. So far so good.... First shave was awesome. I used the derby DE blades and they worked out perfect for me. This is a very durable piece of equipment. It takes a bit to get used to but it&#x27;s worth the switch. It&#x27;s a much better shave, very close shave, two passes and you will feel like a million bucks. Worth every penny and it&#x27;s perfect for the beginner or even daily user.</li>
    <li> Extremely well made and should last a lifetime if cared for properly. I bought this after shaving with a double edge safety razor for a few months. It uses half of a double edge safety razor blade and it will give you a close shave. There is a learning curve to the technique and I did cut myself a few times before I figured it out. The angle that you hold the blade to your face is key. Too shallow of an angle and you won&#x27;t get a close shave. Too steep of an angle and you will cut yourself. The hardest part is figuring out how to shave around your mouth and chin. Once you get the technique down it is a very cost effective way to get a great shave. I gave it 4 out of 5 because the plastic inserts that hold the blade in place seem very cheaply made and I worry they will not last.</li>
    <li> This handle is great.  Compared to other handle on the market in its class, it stands out.  I&#x27;ll be using it for a long time.</li>
    <li> Way to light, a straight razor should have some substance, some weight to it, the weight of the razor should do the work, with this razor you end up pushing and that is how accidents happen...would not buy another one.</li>
    <li> Works well...a great starting place before jumping to a straight razor. I&#x27;m sure a straight razor is heavier but the girth works for me. TAKE YOUR TIME!!!! watch a video on how to make your lather, you&#x27;ll think what does it matter and that your doing it right but trust me, properly made lather has a huge impact on your shaving experience; it actually made some of my not so great blades feel much better. Use the counter top to push the blade holder insert out.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful! I opted for a shavette over a straight razor because I am far to lazy for the maintenance on one. With this I just snap a Feather blade in half, load in the plastic holder thing, slide that into the handle, and then tadah! Super close shave and haven&#x27;t cut myself yet and it has been over a month of daily usage.</li>
    <li> Bought this razor to try shaving with a straight razor before putting a lot of money out.  Found I like shaving with it (just not in a hurry) .  Will continue using it while eyeballing a better one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Shavette as an introduction to straight shaving. I recently joined the rebellion against high priced shaving cartridges. I went back to my trusty double edge holder and double edged blades but I wanted to try a straight razor without all the high maintenance of stropping and honing. It has become apparent to me that this Shavette is ment for professional barbers who need to change blades frequently due to hygiene concerns. This product is well made and will last a lifetime and provides the option of using either short snapped in half double edge blades or the longer Dovo shaper blades which seem more suited for razor cutting hair styles. The unit comes with plastic adopters for the short and long blades and a long blade hair styling fixture. This allows the device the flexibility of using inexpensive short blades (like the Derby blades). I&#x27;ve only recently begun to straight shave and so far I prefer the short blades to the long blades (both of which are included as samples) so I can&#x27;t compare the Shavette to a fixed blade straight razor but if I were a barber and needed to shave and cut hair with a razor I could see how practical and useful this device would be. My only concern is that the short blades are a little tricky to position in the holder (the long blades position very easily with pegs in holes) and I don&#x27;t know how durable the plastic hinge on the holders are but seem like they would still be able to be used even if the hinge broke.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen this one on different adds and thought that I&#x27;d give it a try. The angle is perfect and the shave is smooth. I can hear the blade cutting the whiskers easily but still hear them, no matter what blade is used. There is one thing that I do not like about the shaver and thats the work that goes into removing the  blade. The plastic incert holds the blade easily and it doe shave, but I wouldn&#x27;t degrade a razor over Paci steel. maybe it&#x27;s just to rudimentary. Even so I&#x27;me guess this one was into other things, I have another Dovo that doesn&#x27;t require blades.</li>
    <li> This razor is a good one to learn on it is not that expensive and relatively easy to use. I should have read the product reviews about the blades that they say to pair with it because they are not the right size! However, they do fit in the Red insert, just smaller than the blades that come with the razor.</li>
    <li> I wanted to get into straight shaving my head. However I didnt want to risk a $250 price tag if I didnt like it. Thus, my review. I think its a great balance. I think I&#x27;d get annoyed with the maintenance of the blade or more the likely dull it if I bought a typical straight razor. I&#x27;ll be sticking with this one for a number of years. It comes with a a couple of &amp;#34;holsters&amp;#34; for the different size options straight blades come in. The red one shown is for small, There&#x27;s a black for longer blades, and some weird wavy design. I think its for trimming since it goes just beyond the blade. Incase you dont want a nothing there shave. I keep it in my shower and still haven&#x27;t seen any rust forming after using it for 4 months. A perfect starter razor for anyone looking to give it a shot, but dont want to go all in with the investment. I will leave with a warning though. I have discovered straight razors contain blood magic. Long cut&#x27;s magically appear about 5 minutes after you stopped shaving the area. These things are sharp. Take it slow and have napkins near by or be in the shower. Things will get messy.</li>
    <li> I love this razor for line ups</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor specifically because I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on a real, all-metal razor due to my inexperience with shaving with straight razors (I have recently upgraded). I purchased this product because I liked the idea of the metal handle; I didn&#x27;t want to spend $30+ on an all-plastic razor. After purchase, I received an email from Dovo saying that the steel handle razor was no longer in stock, even though Amazon listed it as them having at least 4 left. Whatever. They were offering to send one of a different color and with a box of 100 free razor blades (even though I had already purchased a pack of 100). I informed them I didn&#x27;t care about color just as long as it was the SAME product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product I received, however, was all plastic, not the metal one I had wanted. I then contacted Dovo saying that I didn&#x27;t think it was fair that I paid the extra money for a metal razor only to receive a plastic one. They agreed and offered me a $10 refund...I never received the $10 back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product feels...cheap to say the least, and the Dovo signature printed on the casing ended up coming off during the shave, so I ended up have small black ink dots get stuck to my face after the first two shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this good for beginners? Eh. I guess. I&#x27;m just glad I no longer have to use it.</li>
    <li> I started looking into shavettes b/c I was looking for ways to save money without cramping my lifestyle.  Not only has this shavette been able to break the cost of shaving down to $18-$19 a year after an up front cost that pays itself off at about 9 mos., but this shavette has further enhanced my lifestyle instead of cramping it.  I love shaving!  It has quickly become one of the highlights of my day. Fun and frugal!  Who would have thought!</li>
    <li> I really like straight razor shaving, this is my first single blade razor. I can tell by different qualities of disposable single edges, that a real straight edge would be much better, however I wanted to make sure this is something I can stick with so I want to run through 100 razors or so and then this will probably become a travel razor for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The prep is paramount, the only horrid shaves I&#x27;ve done to myself were when I skimped on the shaving prep. Getting your face nice and hot, the whiskers soft and wet and a good lather is the key. It&#x27;s really not as difficult as some make it seem.</li>
    <li> Shaves pretty smooth! Great purchase!</li>
    <li> This item showed up promptly and well packaged, it was exactly as it was described and was perfect as a beginner shavette.  Would defintely recommend for anyone just beginning to shave with a straight razor.</li>
    <li> I have used several different types of &amp;#34;shavette razors&amp;#34; and I prefer this one. The blade is exceptionally easy to change (although I wonder about the longevity of the plastic blade holder) and the razor can take the half-double-edge blades or the longer personna-type blades. Although I don&#x27;t remember the description stating it, the razor comes with the adapter for both blade types, the hair shaper adapter (long blade adapter with a comb), and two of each type of blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I expected it to be heavier being the &amp;#34;steel&amp;#34; version. I ordered this version because I was looking for something heavier than aluminum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Sleek design&lt;br /&gt;Easy blade change&lt;br /&gt;Versatile blade choice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight (heavier is nice when it comes to using the razor&#x27;s weight to shave)&lt;br /&gt;Plastic blade holder</li>
    <li> Bought this razor a few months ago because I was too lazy to figure out how to sharpen a legitimate straight razor and let me tell you, it&#x27;s awesome. The blades it comes with are garbage but the razor itself is light and fits decently in your hand without sliding. The sleeves it comes with allow you to use both long and short blades. I&#x27;ve become a fan of using the shorter blades because a face has curves and I certainly don&#x27;t have the skill to handle large areas in one scoop. Definitely would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Not as pictured. It supposed to come with a red insert instead it comes with a clear insert that is equivalent to the red.  My question is why clear?  Is this a Chinese clone of the real thing?  Or have they changed the color of the insert?</li>
    <li> Came on time wasn&#x27;t missing anything work just fine.. Thinking of getting another one..&lt;br /&gt;Wrapped up in bubble wrap and didn&#x27;t see damage at all..</li>
