      <li>The scent of these candles is almost as good as having the real tree.  </li>

      <li>So worth it!</li>
      <li>and they burn clean.</li>
      <li>They seem to last forever and make the entire home smell wonderful very very quickly.</li>
      <li>One of my absolute favorite candles.  </li>
      <li>This obviously makes a great winter candle because of its similarity to a Christmas tree but it smells so good that I intend to use it year round</li>
      <li>Did not look clean and crisp.</li>
      <li>If you want the light, airy smell of Christmas trees then you really want this scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for the holiday season, but I use it all year round to &#x27;naturally&#x27;  freshen my home.  </li>
      <li>but well worth the cost</li>
      <li>Like bringing the outdoors inside with the fresh scent of the forest.  </li>
      <li>Kind of looked like it was left in the heat for a bit.  </li>
      <li>My empty candle was so beloved</li>
      <li>It burns for a long long time - good for the entire season and the smell is so wonderful but not overpowering and very natural smell</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to perfumes and scents, but I find this very pleasant and not overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>The candle is nice but just isn&#x27;t what I expected based on reviews.  </li>
      <li>and it was consistently noticed and purchased by customers.  </li>
      <li>Most authentic fragrance,  it smells as if your standing in a pine forest, Smells like Christmas past.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased the hand soap by the same manufacturer, and I LOVE it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit strong - but so reminiscent of the holiday season and a freshly cut Christmas tree.</li>
      <li>It reminds me of Christmas, but can (and will) be enjoyed all year long.  </li>
      <li>Pay full price and get the candle directly from the manufacturer because my candle was all over the jar.</li>
      <li>Bee keepers have good wicks for a small investment.</li>
      <li>You really should consider trying one of any size.</li>
      <li>This candle doesn&#x27;t have much scent at all.</li>
      <li>I cannot have a real pine tree for Christmas.  </li>
      <li>Smells just like the real tree.</li>
      <li>Really, we would often sell out on a Saturday if we burned it throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>I really wish these sellers would deliever the described item.</li>
      <li>It smells as if you were standing in the middle of a pine forest on a crisp cool day.</li>
      <li>This candle is unlike most scented candles in that it doesn&#x27;t smell like an imitation of a scent bur rather, like the real thing.</li>
      <li>Smelled the most like evergreens than any other candle I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>Other than that I do love the fragrance.</li>
      <li>whatever makes you happy such as small pinecones</li>

    <li> Best scented candle where the scent lasts!! My all time favorite</li>
    <li> The beautiful smell coming from this candle makes me feel as if I&#x27;m in a deep forest.  I&#x27;m really enjoying this candle!</li>
    <li> This candle is unlike most scented candles in that it doesn&#x27;t smell like an imitation of a scent bur rather, like the real thing. This truly smells like a fir tree and it is WONDERFUL. It makes my kitchen smell inviting and home-y. This obviously makes a great winter candle because of its similarity to a Christmas tree but it smells so good that I intend to use it year round</li>
    <li> The fragrance from this candle is great, just like a Fraser fir tree, I buy a new one every year.</li>
    <li> The aroma is absolutely wonderful.  I&#x27;m very sensitive to perfumes and scents, but I find this very pleasant and not overwhelming.  The 3 wick candle adds a pleasant glow to a room without having to light numerous candles.</li>
    <li> Love this candle.  Fragrance is awsome.</li>
    <li> Best smelling Christmas tree candle I&#x27;ve ever had.  Have purchased 3 years in a row now.  Def on the expensive side but well worth the cost...fills the whole house with fir smell...great for homes with an artificial tree</li>
    <li> Best Holiday candle ever!</li>
    <li> I love these candles and buy them every year.  Great scent and they burn clean.</li>
    <li> I love the Thymes fragrances, and the Frasier Fir is the best most natural evergreen candle scent I have ever found. It is the only scented candle I will use.  It&#x27;s perfect for the holiday season, but I use it all year round to &#x27;naturally&#x27;  freshen my home.  It is rather expensive, however.</li>
    <li> The Thymes Large Multi-Wick candle in Frasier Fir scent is wonderful.  The scent is authentic Frasier Fir, as opposed to the usual fake pine smell most Xmas candles have. My deceased parents always had a frasier fir, and this will be the perfect gift for my brother.</li>
    <li> The scent was just what we were looking for, Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;We feel this is a good product for the money and is a good purchase.</li>
    <li> Wonderful winter scent!</li>
    <li> You can literally watch the volume shrink before your eyes. My previous smaller and cheaper one-wick candle in the clear glass container had a longer life...as well as a stronger pine scent.</li>
    <li> Most unique, real smelling, Christmas fir candle in the world!  You won&#x27;t need a tree if you have this candle!  If you do have both, the candle and the tree will enhance each other.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the smell of this candle. It&#x27;s a bit strong - but so reminiscent of the holiday season and a freshly cut Christmas tree. It lasted us all winter and that was with a lot of use.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous aroma!  Smelled the most like evergreens than any other candle I&#x27;ve used.  Makes a great gift.  Would buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> One of my absolute favorite candles.  I look forward to pulling it out after Thanksgiving each year. It has good throw and a nice fresh smell. Not chemical-y like many candles.  It truly smells like you have a Christmas tree even if you do not.  We used to have this candle burning in the little boutique I worked at and it was consistently noticed and purchased by customers.  Really, we would often sell out on a Saturday if we burned it throughout the day.  You will not regret getting the big one- worth the money.</li>
    <li> It smelled great and burned a long time.  It is a little expensive in comparison to similar candles, but no one can match their scent.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> You cant say enough about the wonderful scent of Thymes Frasier Fir. If you want the light, airy smell of Christmas trees then you really want this scent. The larger candles burn longer, FYI</li>
    <li> Love these candles and keep purchasing over and over as the fragrance is so wonderful!  I give them for gifts too because everyone loves this scent!  It is always a winner!!!</li>
    <li> My favorite all year round I always use it in the living room by the fireplace</li>
    <li> Received just as described.  This is my very favorite candle.</li>
    <li> While the cost of the candle may seem high, when you open the box and smell the fragrance you will understand why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no trace of artificial pine in this candle. It smells as if you were standing in the middle of a pine forest on a crisp cool day. The scent lingers for hours after the candle is blown out.  While it is wonderful to use year round, Christmas is the best. You can light it in the same room as an artificial tree and it will seem as though the scent was coming from a newly cut pine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always have one lit when guests arrive for dinner.</li>
    <li> The candle is nice but just isn&#x27;t what I expected based on reviews.  The scent is just not inspiring the bath and body works candles are a higher quality.</li>
    <li> We love the candle, but the shipping and handling failed. The candle melted somewhere along the way. We had to remove the candle from the glass container and reset the wicks. Not too difficult, but a disappointment.</li>
    <li> I compare Thymes Frasier Fir with these other wonderful candles that I also have&lt;br /&gt;---Diptyque - Feus de Bois&lt;br /&gt;---Archipelago Botanicals - Tofino&lt;br /&gt;---Archipelago Botanicals - Juniper Leaves&lt;br /&gt;---Tocca - Chamonix&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to pick just one candle:&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS THE CANDLE FOR CHRISTMAS!&lt;br /&gt;It has a great throw (fills a large room with scent).&lt;br /&gt;The evergreen scent is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I want to feel like I&#x27;m in a forest, I burn all of these candles at the same time.</li>
    <li> Minus 1 star because the wax burns super fast and minus 1 star for the price. It silly to spend $40 or $50 for a candle. At least I expect the candle to be made with a slower burning wax so that it lasts longer. Otherwise I love the smell. I tried a few other brands that cost less many of with didn&#x27;t smell as good or produce at repenting smell when burning. But Cheasepeak candle produces a Frazier Fir candle that is great and you may find it at Marshalls for 6 bucks.</li>
    <li> Always a quality product experience. LOVE IT</li>
    <li> This is the most fragrant candle I have ever used -  my favorite in the Thyme&#x27;s collection.  It smells just like you are in a Frasier Fir forrest!  Wonderful during the winter holiday seasons.</li>
    <li> Smells just like the real tree.</li>
    <li> Most authentic fragrance,  it smells as if your standing in a pine forest, Smells like Christmas past. A must-have if you own an artificial Christmas tree!</li>
    <li> I Love, Love, Love this product... I will definitely buy it again  &amp; I&#x27;ll buy it from this seller...</li>
    <li> Huge candle in my favorite Holiday fragrance. The best price around. Expensive but worth it.The fragrance lingers even when the candle is not lit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the hand soap by the same manufacturer, and I LOVE it. This candle doesn&#x27;t have much scent at all. I tried burning it for a couple of hours, but to no avail. Oh well, will still use soap!</li>
    <li> This is an expensive candle and I order one a  year it is  worth every penny. They seem to last forever and make the entire home smell wonderful very very quickly. It is a very pleasant scent pine etc. just as stated but better than they can state. You really should consider trying one of any size. You won&#x27;t be sorry. I am known to burn even in summer it smells so good. I would rather pay and get one great candle than have bad wicks, yucky smells etc. If you do make a habit of ordering you eventually also get extra beautiful glass containers to then fill with whatever makes you happy such as small pinecones etc.. If you have a little candle left and you light it you can pour left over in with a little candle wick to make a mini candle using some small little jar. Having a helping hand makes this go easier. Bee keepers have good wicks for a small investment. You can also fill empty glass container with a few tea lights too. My empty candle was so beloved I just couldn&#x27;t throw it away. There is nothing about Thymes I do not like. Great Stuff! I also believe it is worth getting a good wick in candles or you have just yuck wick scent. Some wicks also have lead so be careful about your candles unless you like buring lead around the home. I will order again.</li>
    <li> I just received this candle as a Christmas gift and it smells delicious!!  It reminds me of Christmas, but can (and will) be enjoyed all year long.  The Frasier Fir pine needle design is lovely, too.  I will be giving these as gifts NEXT year!</li>
    <li> The product I received was not like the picture.  I wanted to one in the picture.  I could have bought the candle in a plain green container in a number of other places.  Specifically ordered from here because of the picture.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Excellent value. Saved over $15 compared to purchasing at local retail store. The scent of the candle is really incredible, too.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite candle for the holidays. its a bit expensive for a candle, but it really is worth it-- it&#x27;s a gift to myself every year around the holidays :)</li>
    <li> The absolute best smelling candle for Christmas, or any time for that matter, EVER.</li>
    <li> Pay full price and get the candle directly from the manufacturer because my candle was all over the jar. Kind of looked like it was left in the heat for a bit.  Did not look clean and crisp.</li>
    <li> Best winter candle EVER! Smells just as if I had a huge Frasier For in my living room. So worth it!</li>
    <li> I cannot have a real pine tree for Christmas.  The scent of these candles is almost as good as having the real tree.  They do not smell like perfume.</li>
    <li> the fragrance was marvelous as usual, but the green container rather than the etched fir sprigs was a huge disappointment.</li>
    <li> My favorite winter fragrance &amp; at a good price...what could be bad?</li>
    <li> I really love this candle and fragrance but I expected to receive the one pictured in this listing. I love the glass container the candle comes in and it is not the one I received. The one I got was in plain green glass. I really wish these sellers would deliever the described item. I am buying what I can visually see in the listing! Other than that I do love the fragrance.</li>
    <li> This candle burned well but I did not think it emitted enough aroma to warrant the high cost of the candle.</li>
    <li> Lasts forever and smells divine.</li>
    <li> My favorite holiday scent...long lasting.  Like bringing the outdoors inside with the fresh scent of the forest.  Wouldn&#x27;t be Christmas without it!</li>
    <li> Just a wonderful smelling candle.. Kind of on the expensive side but it just smells so great that it&#x27;s worth it to me... It is a year round scent in my opinion. Really love it....</li>
    <li> The most wonderful Christmas candle ever. It burns for a long long time - good for the entire season and the smell is so wonderful but not overpowering and very natural smell</li>
    <li> Awesome!  What I wanted, SMELLS LIKE CHRISTMAS TREE!</li>
    <li> Love the Christmas smell of these.</li>
    <li> We are addicted to this scent during the Fall &amp; Winter months.</li>
