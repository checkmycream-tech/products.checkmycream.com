<li> This was somewhat deceiving as I thought they were normal sized deodorant containers.  </li>
<li> They are smaller than regular deodorant containers- which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
<li> I got both the white and clear.</li>
<li> and they do not leak from the bottom as long as whatever you put in there remains in solid form.</li>
<li> So I immediately ordered the larger ones and anticipated the smaller ones to come in a little later.  </li>
<li> Not normal deodorant size.</li>
<li> Just what I expected.</li>
<li> These small deoderant type containers work well for purse size solid lotion.</li>
<li> I will keep and use because it will take me more time to return, but I am really disappointed.  </li>
<li> For the price, I was extremely dissapointed.</li>
<li> These are extra small cases.</li>
<li> Maybe half the size.  </li>
<li> I have to admit, I&#x27;m one of the few that didn&#x27;t read the size before placing the order; using them for hard lotion bars.  </li>
<li> Never seen a deodorant container this small.</li>
<li> I guess these would work as deoderant containers but in my opinion, I think they&#x27;re a litte too small.</li>
<li> I have learned that essential oils will make the bad chemicals leach out of the plastic into the deodorant.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s unfortunate that people leave less than 5 Star reviews on the product because they failed to read the product description and see that they are 15ml (1/2 oz) containers.</li>
<li> My bad.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I must not have read the description well enough because when they came they were much smaller than I anticipated. Still a great product though.</li>
    <li> I liked everything about these except the size. Bigger ones would have worked better for what I used them for. It was my fault for not paying attention to the ounces. They made nice samples for the product I made.</li>
    <li> Love these. Perfect for my lotion bars or travel deodorants :)</li>
    <li> These are small containers, not really ideal for deodorant, but good for skin balms.</li>
    <li> Making sunscreen and some home DIY projects this summer and these are perfect.  SO excited.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> These are actually slightly smaller than I wanted. They work OK, however.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I&#x27;m one of the few that didn&#x27;t read the size before placing the order; using them for hard lotion bars.  So I immediately ordered the larger ones and anticipated the smaller ones to come in a little later.  They are perfect for lotion bars!  I like the larger ones too, but these are great!</li>
    <li> Works great for what it&#x27;s designed for.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time I have purchased these and they are clean and easy to fill and they do not leak from the bottom as long as whatever you put in there remains in solid form. The work well for me for samples and I have not had any complaints about them. I would recommend and reuse these again.</li>
    <li> I love the containers and order them all of the time. It&#x27;s unfortunate that people leave less than 5 Star reviews on the product because they failed to read the product description and see that they are 15ml (1/2 oz) containers. It&#x27;s kind of obnoxious actually. They are smaller, travel size containers. Not normal deodorant size. There, now you know! :) I love these containers! Great quality slide on top and holds enough product for small sunscreen bars I make homemade! :)</li>
    <li> These are  perfect size for pouring your lotion bar recipe into so you can carry it in your purse. They are smaller than regular deodorant containers- which is exactly what I wanted. GREAT PRICE!</li>
    <li> Fast service!  Product is exactly what i was l looking for</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for good travel sized deoderant tubes or lotion bar containers or want alot of homeade lip balm- these are great. Recipes I have made do not run out the bottom!</li>
    <li> These were perfect sizes to make some salves and carry them in your purse. Will definitely be ordering more.</li>

    <li> This was somewhat deceiving as I thought they were normal sized deodorant containers.  For the price, I was extremely dissapointed.</li>
    <li> Love them, just what I wanted</li>
    <li> These are extra small cases. Like travel size</li>
    <li> These small deoderant type containers work well for purse size solid lotion. They would be great for lip balm or even solid perfumes. I got both the white and clear. Both are equally nice. I can see the white one better in my cluttered purse but the clear one is more classy. I guess these would work as deoderant containers but in my opinion, I think they&#x27;re a litte too small. Of course in an emergency I&#x27;d be glad to have one with deoderant in my purse as well! Lol!&lt;br /&gt;These little tubes are well made, easy to use and the top goes on securely. Filled with solid lotion, these make excellent gifts.</li>
    <li> I thought they would be a bit bigger but other than that they are great</li>
    <li> These are compact for first aid balms and anit itch balms.</li>
    <li> Perfect tube for my homemade cosmetics. The smaller sized tube is a perfect size.</li>
    <li> They didn&#x27;t hold the liquid.  It just seeped out of the bottom.</li>
    <li> Love the product! Work great for my muscle rubs that I make, went to order more but now they say they wont send to Alaska so I guess I won&#x27;t be ordering from this company anymore.</li>
    <li> Wish they weren&#x27;t plastic. But I can make deodorant with probiotics instead of essential oils.  I have learned that essential oils will make the bad chemicals leach out of the plastic into the deodorant.</li>
    <li> The picture was deceiving, but I should have fully understood the description. Never seen a deodorant container this small.</li>
    <li> Took longer than other items to arrive, but came fine and works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Read the reviews.  Had I, I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered.  They are tiny.  Not the normal deodorant size.  Maybe half the size.  I will keep and use because it will take me more time to return, but I am really disappointed.  The product, for what it is, seems to be fine otherwise.  Buyer beware. My bad.</li>
