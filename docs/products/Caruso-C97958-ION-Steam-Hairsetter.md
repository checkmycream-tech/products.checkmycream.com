<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had the old Caruso, but this puts that to shame!  It heats (steams) much faster, rollers also ready quicker... and the end result with the ionized steam MUCH smoother.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Very nice and does a good job, but sent back, hands to crippled to use...had to send back..N...took to long to put hair around the foam!</li>
    <li> Replaced old set and brand and was very happy with product.  Very gentle on hair and great price.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have used a Caruso ionic steam setter for years. This was a replacement to a previous Caruso that had the &amp;#34;peg&amp;#34; broken off in a move.  I have absolutely loved my Carusos.  They do a great job with my long hair--making soft curls that look just great.  AND it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair. My only complaint is they have changed the type of foam on the rollers and they don&#x27;t heat up as well.  Also the early Carusos had you add salt to the water. I think that gave a better curl. Thus the reason for the four stars.  Still, I much prefer the Caruso to any other type of hairsetter.  I get so many compliments on my hair and they&#x27;re because the Caruso does such a great job putting the curl in.</li>
    <li> I have used the Caruso Hairsetter since they first came out with the product in the stores. I get the best curl for my fine hair so quickly. The curls stay in well for me so I don&#x27;t need all hair products.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Makes even stubbornly straight hair curly and the steam is actually good for your hair compared to just heat rollers.</li>
    <li> These steam rollers are the best to give my hair the soft curls I want.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Caruso rollers for the past 20 years.</li>
    <li> I have used the Caruso for a few years and I needed a new one so I ordered this model. I like the new design. It&#x27;s smaller and heats very fast.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine straight hair, and have tried pretty much every hair setter made in the last 40 years.  The one I liked best, back in my Pleistocene era, was a Shick-made steam setter that went off the market ages ago.  I have several other setters but decided to try these because they use steam. (And, I guess, because hope springs eternal.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really not worth the price, and the need to heat each curler individually makes it  cumbersome, plus the clips leave a mark.  You need to have a place to put the curlers and clip-tops so you can grab them easily, then hold one in one hand while you stick another curler on.  And they really don&#x27;t work any better than any other hairsetter I&#x27;ve used--in some cases, worse.  I have even left them in my hair for several hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a great fan of hot rollers, but if you&#x27;re in the market, get a set and leave your hair very slightly damp (or spritz it very slightly) before you put the curlers in.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.</li>
    <li> one curler from each size was missing. The cover/cap was there but no inside . This is the 3rd one that I have had over the years. This is the first one that I was disappointed in. Some of the curlers are too tight and it pulls the top off when you take them off the steamer.</li>
    <li> The curls stays a lot longer compared to regular hot-curlers.  The curls do come out pretty tight, so need to adjust the curling time accordingly.  Great that it doesn&#x27;t damage not one strand of your hair!!!  And this also works great on fake-hair/wigs.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my Caruso.  I bought the steaming unit and curlers 2 years ago and use them on a daily basis for large soft curls.  The other day, while showing my hairdresser how I want my hair done for my wedding, my Caruso stopped working right in front of us and wouldn&#x27;t steam any more, so I immediately rushed home to order myself another machine!  This time I ordered the larger unit than I originally had, the Caruso C97958 with the ION setting, pretty neat, and I ordered another set of the super large curlers to add to my collection.  My older curlers are 2 years old and still feel like the new curlers that I had ordered!  My wedding is in 2 more days and we plan to use my Caruso and all my extra large curlers as well as take it with us on our honeymoon!  Thank you Caruso!  I love your products and have HIGHLY recommended both the steaming unit and the curlers to my hairdresser and all my friends!  :)</li>
    <li> I had a set of the original Caruso steam rollers back in the &#x27;90s and lost them during one more or another.  I had never seen them again since then since then, but lo and behold, Amazon to the rescue!  These new rollers performed exactly as my old ones did, and without having to carry around a plastic baggie of salt everywhere I went.  I got these to set my hair for a play I was performing in, so portability, ease of use, and a quick set were all pretty important.  I love that they don&#x27;t take up a lot of room in my bag, though I do wish the travel case included with it were a little sturdier.  The handles a rather flimsy and I have a feeling they&#x27;ll tear long before I&#x27;m done with the rollers.  Luckily, I&#x27;m using the case more for storage rather than actual travel, so maybe it&#x27;ll hold up okay.  I&#x27;m still looking for a different case in the meantime, though.</li>
    <li> I have had my roller set for a little over 2 months.  During that time I have used this product 2 times.  Of those 2 times, I was only pleased with the result once.  Yesterday, I decided to roll my hair and give this product another chance.  The problem is, the Caruso ION Steam Hairsetter would not heat up.  It actually began to have an electrical smell after several minutes of heating so I unplugged the unit.  Additionally, I had to order extra rollers, incurring more cost, because the rollers sent with the set were not sufficient to roll my long hair.  Since I am outside of the return window, I will have to eat the cost of the hairsetting set and the extra rollers.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, very straight hair that barely holds a curl. It&#x27;ll look curly for a second, but as soon as I touch it (I wouldn&#x27;t dare brush it), the curls are gone. But I&#x27;ve finally found something that will make my hair curly or wavy without spending hours with a curling iron or having to sleep in rollers, and it&#x27;s this Caruso hairsetter. It heats up quickly, and the curls set quickly, too. The best part is, my hair actually stays curly all day! The first time I used it, my hair was almost TOO curly. I can even brush my hair without ruining the curls. I only put the roller on the steamer for about 5 seconds so my hair won&#x27;t get too wet, so it makes the process even faster. The only problem I&#x27;ve run into is that my hair is a little too fine to hold the large and extra-large rollers, and I have to roll a larger chunk of hair to keep the rollers from slipping off. More hair on the roller &#x3D; less curl. So I use the big rollers for loose waves or a little volume. Still, I&#x27;m not complaining. My straight, fine hair is big and curly, so I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Also, I know it&#x27;s not recommended by the manufacturer, but I put a 1/4 tsp of salt in the reservoir and it made the curls last longer.</li>
    <li> I have very thick and very long hair, I use all the jumbo large sized rollers and I&#x27;m left with beautiful thick enviable waves that last a few days. I was so sick of using a curling iron that I ordered these on a whim and I&#x27;m so glad I did! Will definitely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Works as described. Very please with the product.</li>
    <li> Have used this  product in the past and was very pleased.  My hair is thinning and was told by a dermatologist that I needed to quit using a curling iron so I ordered my second machine.  It is wonderful and really does a good job on fine, thin hair.  My only complaint is that with the kit I got about 20 huge rollers that I cannot use. Had to order more small rollers at an additional cost.</li>
    <li> These curlers are ok. I guess it&#x27;s worth it since it&#x27;s not going to damage my hair like hot rollers or curling irons, that makes me glad I got it, but the results are just ok. The curls don&#x27;t stay that long, and the shape/texture of the curl is messier, not smooth &amp; polished like hot rollers. I got excited when I read the reviews, it sounded so great, but doesn&#x27;t actually perform like some reviewers said. Maybe it does for their  hair, but not mine.  I&#x27;d recommend if your hair is getting damaged from heat over use, as mine was getting to be, then it&#x27;s worth the switch, regardless. But don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Caruso hairsetters for about 15 years. This is my third set, and I&#x27;m always very pleased and relieved that they&#x27;re still making them. These curlers do a great job without excessive heat to damage your hair. The variety of roller sizes gives you many styling options.</li>
    <li> This product takes too long to use.  It only takes a single curler at a time and it sucks.</li>
    <li> I just click on the buy button - paid with my visa - received a confirmation - received the set with in a week. Everything was just as expected.</li>
    <li> I love the Caruso Professional ION Steam set of rollers. I am on my 5th set of rollers.  I use them everyday.  It leaves my hair in good condition, lasts all day and actually is good for anyone&#x27;s hair.  I purchased my most recent set on Amazon.  I received it on April 23, 2006.  I used it less than two months, then with a loud pop, it died.</li>
    <li> I have been using Caruso since 1990 or so.  My first one was pink and needed salt.  I still use it. &lt;br /&gt;I also use the small newer one pictured here for travel.   For some reason I get a bouncier curl with the old salt one. &lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t live without them !!!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  This is my 3rd set and would highly recommend to any and all.</li>
    <li> As an African-American I was unsure of how the product would work on my hair.  I am still a novice with the product, but it seems to be great for curly styles.  It is also great if you want to style synthetic hair (various braid styles).    I would definitely recommend this product for others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Caruso hairsetters since highschool, which makes it over ten years now.  I&#x27;m a huge fan!  The best part is that it does not damage your hair.  This time I got the ionic hairsetter.  It makes a clicking noise when set to the ionic setting, which I assume it&#x27;s normal.  I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference though by using the ionic setting as compared to the regular setting.  Either way, I think it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend.  Hair does not get damaged from using this product.  Fast, easy set too.  Not nearly as time consuming as regular curling iron.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on the great reviews.  It&#x27;s always a challenge to curl my long, straight, coarse Asian hair, but I thought I would give these curlers a try.    They&#x27;re easy enough to use.  I have no complaints about the clicking noise when it&#x27;s on the ionic setting.  The curlers also heat up very quickly, although you can only heat one up at a time.  The range of curlers this particular set comes with seems to be enough variety to create a number of looks.  And yes, the curls are silky and pretty.      The booklet says that the curls can only be relaxed via a shampooing.  This must be the case for someone else&#x27;s hair.  For me, the curls only lasted about an hour or two.  I used the curlers on clean, dry hair and left them in for about 20-30 minutes after I put the last curler in.  At first, the curls were as promised.  After two hours, even the curliest locks had loosened into waves, but my hair still looked pretty.  At the four hour mark, it was straight again.    I recommend this product to anyone looking to add some body to otherwise flat, straight hair for a limited amount of time.  If you&#x27;re looking to set curls that last all day, I&#x27;d recommend looking elsewhere if you have hair like mine.  Although this product isn&#x27;t perfect, I prefer it to curling my hair with a curling iron.</li>
    <li> I adore this product! I recently purchased this, becuase I want to minimize the amount of heat I apply to my hair (flat irons, curling irons, etc). and came across this. It is extremely simple to use and produced great results each time. I usually use it in the morning before heading to work; it works quickly and is hassle-free. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> This is my second set of rollers!  I&#x27;ve had them for about 15 years and I love them!  I was so sad when my first set quit but the new ones are even better!  No damage to hair and really easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love steam curlers. They actually live up to their promise, and in this day and age, I appreciate that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually wanted to get the Vidal Sassoon brand, but after extensive searching, I couldn&#x27;t find it. In years past, I had gone through quite a few Caruso&#x27;s, and the Sassoon brand lasted a lot longer. The fairly short life of these things is why I couldn&#x27;t give this five stars. These little devils have more than doubled in price from when I first started using them, so I would like to see them last a lot longer than they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since Caruso appears to be the only game in town, I went ahead and got one along with an extended warranty from Square Trade. It didn&#x27;t cost that much extra, and it gives me some peace of mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this product, my hair does maintain its body throughout the day, so it lives up to its claim.  However, because I have very short hair, I paid for a lot of rollers that I&#x27;ll never use.  I wish they would have one for shorter hair, and one for longer hair so we could use more of the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of rollers, those things don&#x27;t last very long, and they&#x27;re not cheap to replace. That&#x27;s really the only downside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hint: Clean this type of setter with vinegar every weekend. Just pour it in, turn it on, and let it clean for about five minutes.  I think that&#x27;s why I think mine have lasted longer than they normally would have. Also, always use distilled water.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product (or the Vidal Sassoon twin) for many years.  Can&#x27;t find the Carruso on the shelf anywhere anymore and I am sad.  The soft LASTING curls can&#x27;t be beat and there is no damage to the hair from heat, it is all done with steam.</li>
    <li> as described.  shipped quickly.  cheers!</li>
    <li> This \\&quot;supposed\\&quot; hair curler is the biggest farce of a product I&#x27;ve ever encountered or wasted money on.  After using it your hair still looks like you just crawled out of bed.  From the clumsy curler to the way the curler mashes the hair, there is absolutely no way this product can leave you with a head of hair that you would take out in public.  The only reason I still have it, is because I got sick and couldn&#x27;t test it out before the 30 days were up.  I just made some rich guy OR girl a little richer - story of my life.  Bottom line. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Clips don&#x27;t stay in well tangle long hair gave away</li>
    <li> This set is my 4th in the last 15 years.  The steam setter is the only one that works for my baby fine hair.  It gives extra body and shine and gentle curls.</li>
    <li> I have never been able to curl my own hair.  A friend from my office made me buy this and she was spot on. I love it!  What I have noticed, is that you need to have some sort of product in your hair prior to putting in the rollers or it doesn&#x27;t hold; because it curls by steam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quick and easy.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I received the item on time and it was in great shape. It&#x27;s very easy to use and very convenient. Came with a bag to place the steamer and the rollers in. It also came with a book that teaches you different ways you can use this product. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have thin, baby fine hair that is just shoulder length.  Normally, I have been using jumbo velcro rollers just on the top of my head to gain volume and sleep in them using a neck pillow.  Not ideal given velcro can easily pull on fine hair and destroy it over time.  Curling irons or any type of heat would fry my hair nor can I use product that weighs my hair.  I tried these steam rollers in jumbo size as an alternative.  The unit heats up quickly.  For fine hair, you can only put the roller on the steamer for 3-5 seconds max or roller will make your hair too damp and any volume will completely fall flat.  Less is more. Leave in hair 15 minutes before removing and finger comb.  I found that the roller covers were too heavy for my hair and the rollers would simply fall out.  So I replaced the covers with the Conair Roller Clips and have had more success (and better sleep).  The velcro rollers did give me a little more volume (velcro jumbo rollers are larger than Caruso&#x27;s jumbo rollers)and it lasted longer but not by much.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much. Its easy to use and most importantly, Im natural and dont have to worry about heat damage. I used these on blown out hair for big curls and lots of body!!</li>
    <li> I used to use one of the earlier Carusos, and I can honestly say that the Caruso is my favorite way to get a curl that holds (with no hairspray needed), and does not do damage to my hair.  Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I bought this product in hopes of getting flawless results for hours in a day. I have very thin, very healthy, and very straight hair. When I tried this product,I first left it in for 10-15-20 minutes on three different occasions. I&#x27;m not saying this product was horrible because its results came out great each time; voluminous curls, light hair, no frizz, and healthy shine. The big BUT is that it did not stay in tact for 24 hours like advertised. Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair, but my hair literally went flat in a matter of minutes. I even tried using hairspray (which I despise), one of the 3 times I tested this product and yet it still went flat with very light, unattractive waves. Thus, my overall thought of this product is not so great.</li>
    <li> There are so many good reviews on this product, but beware! This isn&#x27;t a magical hairsetter. If your hair doesn&#x27;t curl well with normal curlers, this won&#x27;t be any better. if your hair is naturally straight, the heat from the steam wont be strong to hold curl in your hair. You&#x27;ll probably have better luck with ceramic curlers, or better yet with a curling iron.</li>
    <li> This is about the only place I can find Caruso Steam Rollers....for a reasonable price.  I&#x27;ve used this product for years through many different styles.  Love them.</li>
    <li> I remember when these were on TV as an infomercial. Oh  I had to have it!  My cousins had one and you know what happens when you go to someone&#x27;s house and use their stuff.You have to have your own.  This was in the late 80s early 90s if I remember right.&lt;br /&gt;  I am African American and have relaxed hair. I love this thing! It curls just like it says.  You need to let the steam rollers dry and use the appropriate hair products to keep your hair moist because  the steam does dry it out a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I saw this product at my local Sally&#x27;s and was like\\&quot; I remember this. How is this any different from before?\\&quot;  It&#x27;s cheaper that&#x27;s how!  I will have to pick one  up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; DO.. read the directions.&lt;br /&gt; DO NOT put your hand over the steam stream. It&#x27;s real, it will work.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT put the roller on the steam too long, it will get to wet.&lt;br /&gt; DO allow the rollers to dry. I would say about a good 10 minutes or  longer.&lt;br /&gt;  I learned all these things on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy this product if you have it. :) it&#x27;s really a good tool.  Do make sure to  use this in a clear space so you do not spill the water all over the place.  Use common sense safety wise.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Caruso steam curlers for over 10 years and love them.  They&#x27;re faster and easier on your hair than a curling iron, but they&#x27;re hard to find.  Amazon always has them, so they&#x27;re easy to shop for.</li>
    <li> every easy to use, only take a few minutes and the hair is perfectly done! plus the hair won&#x27;t be hurt! highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I got a second steam hairsetter because I forgot to turn off my first one.  It got fried when it ran out of steam.      I love this steam hairsetter.  I have straight-ish fine hair that I was damaging with my flat iron.  The steam hairsetter doesn&#x27;t damage your hair and leaves it soft instead.</li>
    <li> I used the similiar product 10 years ago and couldn&#x27;t find the replacement at any retail stores.  I love this because of the compact size and the dual voltages.  This&#x27;s great for me to do the international travel.  Strongly recommend this!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0002JKPA4 Caruso C97958 Professional ION Steam Hairsetter]]  I have used this product many years ago and have always been very pleased with the results achieved. However, this time I received 12 JUMBO rollers when I should have received 6 jumbo and 6 LARGE. I have short hair and will never be able to use any JUMBO rollers let alone 12 of them. Normally I have to order extra large and medium and will do so again, but now I will have to order more than usual because of the error. For those thinking of ordering keep in mind you do need a litte more time in doing your hair because of the drying aspect, but the results are really worth it. My hair is very fine and thinning and this product does the best curl and body and holds the best of anything I have used before.</li>
    <li> I get great spiral curls from this product that lasts long once you let the curls dry completly.The less products in your hair is the better the results (I put products in after to add shine and hold) and the curls are also more silky and smooth if you flat iron your hair lightly especially at the root where your hair (african american relaxed hair) tends to be a more curly and more difficult to get the curler straight down to the root.And I only use distilled water, I buy Battery Water which is suppose to be (100% distilled) and use it on the ion setting and it does&#x27;nt use up too much water which is great.I do think the replacement curlers are expensive though 15$ for a 6 pack, but its a great buy otherwise!!</li>
    <li> After reading some of the opinions of others, I was truly looking forward to getting the Caruso ION Steam Hairsetter.  Unfortunately, I found that although it does set in curl, the curls are flat and they don&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> I just purchased the Caruso Steam hairsetter and I am thrilled with it!  Here&#x27;s my story:  I used to have absolutely gorgeous below the shoulder, shiny light browne hair.  Last year, I decided to get it highlighted blond.  Since I really liked the blond (I have to admit, it looks good on me and totally natural) I continued to get it highlighted.  Unfortunately, the salon (it was a top salon by the way) that I was going to did not highlight my hair correctly.  After about a year, my hair started to get thinner and thinner and started to dry out and break off.  By the end of a year, my hair is wispy, thin and dryed out.  I had no idea what was happening until it was too late.  After going to a different salon (in tears I might add) and speaking with the salon owner, he told me that he could see exactly what they had done to my hair.  He told me that it was obvious that they had colored over the SAME strands each time they highlighted it; when in fact they should have been highlighting and lowlighting the ROOTS ONLY.  As I said, I had no idea what was going on until it was too late to do anything about it.  My once beautiful locks are now only shoulder length ( I had to get about 5 inches cut off) and I am really fortunate that I have anything left at all.  I now am not coloring my hair anymore, I will have to wait years before I get my beautiful hair back b/c of this salon&#x27;s negligence.  Anyway, that being said, I purchased the Caruso steamer in the hopes that it would give my lifeless hair some of its bounce back.  And I&#x27;m happy to say that it absolutely has.  This steamer is amazing.  It made my hair bouncy and curly and shiny.  I was so thrilled with the results b/c I was desperate to find something that would help me!  If you have fine hair or hair that has been badly damaged or even if you have beautiful hair -- I would highly recommend this wonderful product.  The steam is GOOD for your hair and so much better than the traditional dry heat rollers which, if usedtoo much will ruin your hair (not to mention a bad colorist).  Here&#x27;s my other advice:  GRILL your colorist about what they are doing.  Don&#x27;t ruin your hair with overcoloring -- it&#x27;s totally not worth it.  But if you have, get this steamer.  In my opinion it is the \\&quot;mineral powder foundation\\&quot; of hair care.  It&#x27;s incredible.  Period.</li>
    <li> The steam setter did its work well. The only thing bothers me is the beep sound when I use ionic steam setting. The continous un stop beep sound is killing me. So annoy. I did watched some video of others use this product. why there&#x27;s so such sound on their video. Is it a new feature of this product or I am getting a defect one?</li>
    <li> I think they are great hair styling tools.......the curl or body really does hold, just need practice with the roll up.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a styling product that would be easier on my hair than flat or curling irons. This is easier on it but doesn&#x27;t give as polished a look. Hair comes out a little frizzy still and although they show a bunch of different styles, everything pretty much turns out to look the same.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite  rollers. I&#x27;ve used many different types but never was fully satisfied. I love curly hair and I want quick and lasting result without damage to my hair and it is hard to find. My Caruso hair setter is one thing I would not want to live without. It is easy to use,and 15-20 min that I spend to make curls guaranties me 2 days if not more of the beautiful and silky hair, also it and never leaves the ends frizzy and doesn&#x27;t cause me split ends. I  dye may hair so it is important to use the right rollers.Sometimes I combine Caruso set with a bit of Argan Oil at the ends of my hair  or with Gliss Kur Total Repair Liquid Silk Express Conditioner, so  it saves me money on hair cuts.</li>
    <li> I love Caruso rollers! They work great in my hair and do not do any damage. My curls always come out so well. I normally wash my hair, blow dry and put these in right after. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was this came in the mail with a broken top. It still works, but I should have sent it back to get a replacement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these curlers also since the earlier version where you had to use salt.  And I agree that with the salt the curls were a little tighter.  However, it&#x27;s such a great alternative to the hot curling iron that damages you hair.  I&#x27;m on my third one (an original and two replacements) and using the curlers doesn&#x27;t take up that much time.  If you keep the curler on the post and it absorbs too much steam the hair will be too wet and then it&#x27;ll take time for the hair to dry. It takes me less than 15 minutes from start to finish.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Caruso hairsetter for years and this is a replacement. It&#x27;s even better than the older one and the price was better than anyone else. I trust Amazon and will continue to always go to this site for whatever I buy online.</li>
    <li> Hated it! Didn&#x27;t curl my hair well and curls didn&#x27;t stay.</li>
    <li> The device was broken. I plugged it in and nothing happened. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the standard Caruso steam rollers before, and they ususally break after about four months, so my expectations weren&#x27;t too high. But this one was broken from day one, and the warranty is useless!</li>
    <li> I bought this due to the other women with AA hair that swear by the caruso product.   Since I texturize my hair, and its not straight, I had to make some modifications.   Yes, my hair does frizz.   I&#x27;ve used my bonnet dryer with the curlers in.  I&#x27;ve used the bonnet dryer after I&#x27;ve taken the curlers out.   The best strategy is to use the bonnet dry after you take the curlers out, on lower heat.  If the curls aren&#x27;t dry, your hair will frizz.  It is a good thing for us to put moisture on our naturally dry (tendency to be really damaged) hair!   The key is to make sure the hair is more dry afterwards, using another quick heat appliance. I use the regular dryer for 3-10 minutes in the morning.   If my hair gets a little frizzy at work, it doesn&#x27;t really matter.   Everyone ALWAYS comments how nice my hair looks, frizz or no frizz.   It is a nice curl pattern that lasts pretty well.  A good tool to have and EXPERIMENT with.   I bought a second one for my mother who has short hair, and we split the rollers (cheaper than buying the extra rollers).  It looked really nice on her hair. She left her rollers in over night,  I think.     Hot rollers never worked on my hair.  These do -- with some modifications.     By the way did I say these are good for damaged hair?  (not great- due to the foam)...</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have thicker, heavier hair and regular hot rollers have never provided mewith a product that curls my hair and helps it stay curled throughout the day. A curling iron works okay but really damages my hair with regular use and takes a tremendous amount of time. The Caruso hair setter not only gives me curls that last literally for days but it is quick and easy to use and leaves my hair soft and undamaged. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is the second one purchased.   The other one lasted 4 years.  I&#x27;m very happy with the speed and fullness of the curls.  The only problem is that when you take the rollers off there is a slight indent in the hair.  This is fixed by using the hair blower on the crease as you take the roller off.</li>
    <li> The product is great but is FALSELY advertised as the only setter with dual world wide voltage.  The product guide clearly states for 120v ONLY.  So if you are planning to take this overseas, make sure you have a converter for items that create heat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried to use this product a couple times with &#x27;okay&#x27; outcomes. In terms of likes, the product is easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t take long to apply the rollers or for the steam to curl my hair. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t fry the hair like some other products might.   In terms of dislikes, I felt that the plastic guards left unsightly dents in my hair, the curls that it produces on my hair are not as smooth and lovely as I would have hoped, and I found it difficult to get my thick, somewhat frizzy and wavy hair to wrap around the curler. I think the product works best when I thoroughly blowdry my hair straight and then apply for waves. I guess I had hoped that this would be a little more of a miracle product but of course it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s gone into the cabinet and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll use it once in awhile but not as often as I hoped.</li>
    <li> I am truly surprised by how well these curlers work.  My only complaint that there were too many large/jumbo rollers that came with the set and I had to order more medium sized rollers.  The other reviews for the product were helpful and truthful.  My hair is thick so it takes little longer for the curl to set in but I am pleased with the results.  I always get compliments.</li>
    <li> With all the hype on healthy hair forums about the caruso steam rollers, I was very excited when it arrived. After my first attempt I had limp curls that did not last longer than 1 hour. On my second attempt I did it on dry hair with very little products added as I though the moisture from my styling products may have made my hair to limp, nope. On dry hair with minimal product had the same limp hair. Needless to say, the caruso set went right back to Amazon for my refund. I have 4A fine relaxed hair, so this product may be great for those who tex-lax or ladies who are natural with thicker hair.</li>
    <li> I am a second time customer. I had tried it several years ago and was so thankful to find it at this amazing price online. I have been looking to replace the rollers at the beginning but then decided to buy the whole set again. One mainly due to the new Ionic feature and the second reason is that every time I use it, it just makes my hair that much more shinier and softer. I love the convinient size that it comes in and the amazing speed that I can get my hair set.  Last I can use it anytime and as many times as I may need during the week without worrying about it drying or damaging my hair one bit.    Thank you,  Maria Olono</li>
    <li> [update: After a few months, the steamer worked as well as previous versions, so I would give it 4 stars instead. The problem was I was still using rollers from past steamer purchases. They were still in good condition, so I decided to use them up and then move on to the new rollers. But I didn&#x27;t get a good curl using the older rollers, so I gave a disappointed review. The new rollers, though, are different (thicker maybe) and when I used them with the new steamer everything worked normally. I wish it had said somewhere that performance would be effected using the old with the new. But now I have to get more new rollers to work with the machine.]    I, too, have been using the steamer since the salt version -- and I think the original was the best model. It gave a better, stronger flow of steam and the steamer lasted longer than all the later models I&#x27;ve bought. I didn&#x27;t mind having to add salt and I wish the company offered both the no-salt and salt models.  This is probably my 5th Caruso steamer-- I use them until they die. It has been a fantastic curler and a better, hair-healthy alternative to rollers and curling irons. It&#x27;s been quick and easy to use and creates a strong, lasting curl. I&#x27;ve been recommending it for years.  This newest version seemed interesting: new shape, an \\&quot;ion\\&quot; feature and having an \\&quot;off\\&quot; button for the first time. Two small gripes: 1)When using the \\&quot;ion\\&quot; steam it makes a fairly loud ticking noise-- can&#x27;t use when others in the household are still asleep. 2)I can barely see the water line mark on the inside of the reservoir. Big gripe: whether I use the ion or regular steam, neither gives the quick, strong curl that lasts all day. This time when I take off the roller, the curl is limp, still damp and it doesn&#x27;t hold very long-- and I&#x27;ve gotten this result even when I&#x27;ve left the roller in for half an hour.  I think something important has been lost in it&#x27;s sale to a bigger company and technological \\&quot;improvements.\\&quot; I&#x27;ll still use the steameruntil it dies, but my devout loyalty to this product will end with this version. (sigh) :(</li>
    <li> I really like this product because it works! I have rolled my hair at night and slept on curlers for a long time. For various reasons I didn&#x27;t want to have to do that all the time anymore. Now I can roll my hair in the morning and do my make-up etc and by the time I am ready to brush and style my hair it is set. I really doubted this would work this well but it really does. I get the curl that I want for my hair, the curl lasts and that is exactly what I wanted.  The Caruso hairsetter system is great!</li>
    <li> The Caruso Ion Steam Hairsetter is a great product.  It is gentle on your hair and is quick and easy to use.  It is far better than conventional electric rollers.  The Caruso curlers are very light weight vs. the heavy electric rollers and they stay in your hair without using bobby pins or clamps.  I recommend this hairsetter for anyone who uses electric rollers or curling irons.</li>
    <li> I have used Caruso&#x27;s steam curlers in the past.  I decided to try the ION steam. At first  I had trouble getting it started.  After 45 minutes plugged in and &amp;#34;on&amp;#34;  I couldn&#x27;t get steam.  I recalled using a pinch of salt on my old Caruso Hairsetter, so I tried it and bingo.  The steam started after a few seconds.  Now it goes on immediately.  No waiting and works marvelously. The rollers are easy to use.  It does give a nice shine and curl. I have short limp hair.  The small and medium curlers add body and texture.</li>
    <li> I bought this Caruso Ion through Amazon and the first time I used it on regular setting.  and it was fine.  The first time I tried to use it on the ion setting, it just wouldn&#x27;t work and I cannot even get the regular setting to work after I tried the ion setting.  So I have it setting in my drawer with the other 2 sets of rollers from the two previous Caruso I had. I now have 3 sets of rollers.  MY other two machines at lasted about 2 years each.  Now I have a drawer full of Caruso rollers, but not a machine that works.  I look at it every once in awhile so I can remind myself to never buy another one</li>
    <li> I had one of these several years ago that worked like a charm. However, this newer model is a total disappointment. No matter how long I leave the curler on the steamer, my hair ends up too wet. I have tried to put the curler on for a just a second or two, but then it winds up doing absolutely nothing. I curled my daughter&#x27;s hair (which is much thicker) and it looked great...for about an hour. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s changed, but it wasn&#x27;t for the better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought them.  I followed the instructions and had no problems.  The ion setting is noisy, so I just use the steam setting.  I&#x27;ve done curls and spirals with beautiful results.    My only issue:  I received 6 petite, 6 small, 6 medium and 12 jumbo rollers (instead of 6 petite, 6 small, 6 medium, 6 large and 6 jumbo rollers). But it&#x27;s ok. I don&#x27;t miss the large rollers much.</li>
    <li> I have used this type of Caruso product for years (steam curler system).  I found this new version of the product to be a little less than I am used to in performance.  The new system doesn&#x27;t seem to steam as much as the older styles.  I don&#x27;t feel that I get quite a tight of curl and feel that the \\&quot;staying power\\&quot; of the curls is less.  BUT I will continue to use it because the use of steam works best on my hair.[[ASIN:B0002JKPB8 Caruso C97953 SalonPro 30 Molecular Steam Hairsetter with 30 Rollers]]</li>
    <li> Like many others, I have been using Caruso steam curlers since the salt days.  I have very fine but thick hair that is naturally curly but doesn&#x27;t dry curly often.  I lost my original steamer many years ago and nothing short of sleeping with my hair in wet buns has worked.  I was SO RELIEVED to find this updated product online as I was not able to find it in stores anywhere!  This is an amazing product!</li>
    <li> I just love these rollers! The steamer works great, they are ready in seconds and the \\&quot;hold\\&quot; is great too. I like that there are so many rollers in this set.</li>
    <li> Caruso is the best hairsetter for me. Steam rollers are the only way I can create a curl that holds. The new design and ionic sytem is great. Also, the nicest feature is that if I choose not to use the ionic system, I can set it to work like the older models did. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife. So far she is very happy with it. I heard a friend compliment her hair the other evening and she went on and on about her new hot roller system. As a man, I know absolutely nothing about this stuff, but it is rare for my wife to be that vocal about anything, so I suppose that she likes it a lot.</li>
    <li> I purchesed the Caruso as I had been using one for years but my rollers had worn out.  I though I might as well update the machine as mine was so old.  I received the machine and didn&#x27;t open it for a couple of weeks.  When I used it for the first time I found it was defictive and didn&#x27;t work.  I wrote saying it didn&#x27;t work and after over a week I still have no reply.  It was shipped fast enough but I am very disappointed in the service.</li>
    <li> These electric curlers are amazing.  Not only do they make great curls but the curls last for days.  I normally wash my hair every day but when I use these I can go 2 days because the curls just last and my hair looks great.  AMAZING.   I just bought another set for my niece - she loves them too.</li>
    <li> In response to the user that said it took her five minutes to heat each roller, she must be unfamiliar with how the steam setter works.  I have been using Caruso steam setters for over ten years now.  If you leave the roller on for longer than 15 SECONDS then it is too long.  Perhaps the unlearned user doesn&#x27;t realize that the roller doesn&#x27;t need to HEAT, but is instead powered by steam.  I would recommend this product because it is an improvement on the past steam setters (I started out with the setter that required you to put salt in the water). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, I would like to say this, these rollers make the PRETTIEST spiral curls I have ever seen.  Every time I style my hair with them, I receive compliments.  Further, the sets can last for days. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Of note, I am an african american woman with a relaxer, so this is a product that can be used on all hair types.</li>
    <li> Fast, easy and curls last a long time. I had one about 5 years ago and worked it to death. Just make sure you clean it regularly as indicated. Hard water deposits build up and can clog the steams vents.</li>
    <li> Okay so I was super duper excited to get this in the mail.  I tried locating caruso in hair stores, nope, impossible to locate.  Not going to lie, it took me about 4 tries to finally figure out how to maintain the curls promised on the box.  I was putting the rollers on either too short or too long.  I have fine long hair.  What worked for me was, putting a roller on the steamer as I was rolling up a section of my hair and rotating that way.  After I had all the curlers in, I blow dried my hair for about one minute and then set my timer for 15 minutes to set.  Poof!  Finally got what I&#x27;ve been looking for, beautiful curls.  Really happy I got this set.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Caruso but I have used these curlers for about 15+ years.  I gave away my first Caruso(that used salt) to a friend with short hair  because the large curlers were wearing out.  My second one just quit working but also lasted for years.  This is my 3rd Caruso and I&#x27;m shocked at the cheapness of the foam on the curlers.     Can we put salt in these newer model Carusos?  My curls did last for several days with the original model and now I have to use them every day.  I keep buying the Caruso because I don&#x27;t want to burn my hair with hot rollers or curling irons.    I can&#x27;t help but wonder why the Caruso manufacturer fixed something that didn&#x27;t need fixing.</li>
    <li> I really like the Steam Hairsetter.  My hair is a bit thin and using this steam hairsetter gives me more body that lasts longer than your ordinary curlers.  It also sets your hair in a shorter about of time (maybe 10 minutes).  The only complaint is the ticking sound it makes when you push the ION button.  Other than that it is a great steam hairsetter.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Received the Caruso Professional ION Steam Hairsetter.  I had my other  one for about 20 years!  It is good for your hair and helps with split  ends.  The new one is working just fine though I never use the ION setting..  it is a bit loud...so, I only use the steam setting which is just fine!  Had quick delivery as always with Amazon!!</li>
    <li> This hairset that does not include a user&#x27;s manual. I find this unacceptable. I have spent over 1 hour on the Internet trying to find some instructions  and there is nothing available.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve also used caruso since the \\&quot;salt\\&quot; days, I still have my old salt travel steamer (it still works), but I bought the new ion one because it was actually cheaper to get the set than to replace all of the old curlers. The curls do indeed last for days, and i&#x27;ve seen no difference between this ion and the old salt version, as far as curls go. Yes, the ion setting is loud and makes an annoying noise, but you don&#x27;t have to use the ion setting. A couple of tips, if your curls don&#x27;t last for days, or \\&quot;fall\\&quot; after an hour or so, it is probably that you have hard water. This happened to me when we moved into a new home and was quickly (but not cheaply) resolved by getting a water softner. Also, if you use distilled water in the steamer, you won&#x27;t get mineral build up and the product will last longer. love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the Caruso steam curlers, and I&#x27;ve only used them twice - once with just the steam setting and once with the ion setting (as I write this review, the curlers are in my hair). The first time I used it, the curls lasted so long I was reluctant to wash my hair, but after 3 days, it was time to wash my hair even though the curl was still there. The unit produces steam immediately in both settings (I decided to use distilled water). After reading the reviews, I realized that I was actually waiting too long to pick up the steamed curler which is ready even before I&#x27;m finished curling with the previous one. I&#x27;m going to work at this so that I don&#x27;t let the curlers steam too long and get too damp. I also will try other methods of securing the curls (the snap down covers don&#x27;t hold as tight as I would like and on some curls there&#x27;s a little ridge because I don&#x27;t quite have the knack of using them. Someone mentioned spring pony tail holders, and as soon as I figure out what those are, I&#x27;ll try to find some! My hair is very fine, and any other curling method lasts for less than 1 hour. With these curlers, I have fluffy curls for days, and my hair doesn&#x27;t break.</li>
    <li> I have used a curling iron most of my life, but was interested in hot rollers so I decided to give these a shot. I couldn&#x27;t be more excited. I&#x27;m still mastering the art of actually rolling my hair around the curlers (I always have trouble getting the ends wound around the roller neatly), but the curl holds very well. I&#x27;m not getting the days-long lasting curl that some other users are reporting, but they are very solid for at least 12-15 hours. The varied selection of roller sizes that comes with this unit will definitely give you an idea of what will work best for you.</li>
    <li> Great hair setter, lots of curl fast, gentle on hair.  My first one lasted 17 years. I can curl my hair in a few minutes.  Curlers heat in the time it takes to prepare a strand of hair for rolling.</li>
    <li> This product is well made and works as stated.  I have very fine super straight hair and the curls were gorgeous but they didn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like.  I have yet to find a product that does.  This one seems much less damaging though so that is a big plus.  If you have stick straight hair this will probably not be &amp;#34;the&amp;#34; miracle product you have been looking for to make your straight hair curly.  I am sure it is wonderful for people whose hair can hold a curl.</li>
    <li> I am an African-American woman with fine, relaxed hair.  I have used the hairsetter about 5 times now and my hair does not keep the curl.  I have used setting lotion, let the curlers absorb more steam or less steam and have tried using the blow dryer on them while in my hair, but my hair comes out slightly frizzy and then the curl is gone in a couple of hours.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set after carefully reading reviews on many steam rollers. I was replacing a 20 year old steam set that had hard plastic rollers and gave me big bouncy curls in an hour. This set sounded great as reviews indicated needing only 15 minutes to set. I have steamed the rollers anywhere from 5-10 seconds and my hair is NEVER dry in 15 minutes. I often have to use a hair dryer to complete the process so I can get to work on time. Also the roller covers leave dents in your hair. I  purchased the Conair clips as suggested by other reviewers and they help. Still the curls do not last all day, are somewhat flat and no bounce. Since the rollers are foam you cannot get a big bouncy curl like I was looking for. I would not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this unit for a little over a year but after the first month or so stopped using it as a \\&quot;hot\\&quot; set because the rollers and guards just locked in the wetness from the steam and I&#x27;d have to stand and blow dry my head with the curlers in--which takes forever even with my fine, fairly short hair. I did like the lightness of the foam curlers and found out they worked well, cold and dry, for curling my hair in a couple of hours if I wasn&#x27;t in any hurry. But, still disliking those solid plastic guards, I used different sizes of those claw clippies to hold the curlers in place and that worked great. So, while I didn&#x27;t quite get the results I wanted, at least this wasn&#x27;t a complete waste.</li>
    <li> MY WIFE HAD ONE OF THE OLDER TYPES AND LOVED IT.IT WAS TIME FOR A NEW ONE.THE NEW ONE WAS USED THREE TIMES AND THEN IT BROKE.</li>
    <li> Please bring back the steam hair setter that uses salt!!  The new Caruso ION Steam Hairsetter works \\&quot;OK\\&quot;, but not nearly as well as the older models that used to add salt. (Caruso Happy 3-way Traveler)  I also prefer the feature that allows you to steam the cover at the same time, with this one you must steam the roller first then the cover.  The cover tends to slide when placed on the steamer.  I give this item 3 stars because it just doesn&#x27;t work as well on fine-textured hair like mine.</li>
    <li> We received our package today. I ordered it for my wife last week. The box it came in was torn on one half. The original tape was broken and the person who opened it put cheap white tape on it. The steamer box inside the mailing box was opened as well. The gift card that was supposed to come with the package was removed.    The barcode on the shipping label was torn and the delivery person was unable to scan the code. The code had to be put into the system by hand. The delivery person talked with her manager and they said it could be that the box could have been pushed to hard in the truck. I don&#x27;t think so since the other half of the box is in great condition.     If I could show you guys a picture you would see how ridiculous it is.    Other than that the product works great.</li>
    <li> I was impressed with the relaxed, soft curl with the ion unit compared to the original model.  My only complaint and the reason for not giving it 5 stars is it makes a clicking sound during use when you use the  ionic setting.</li>
    <li> I choose this set because my hair was becoming damaged by my curling iron.  It works beautifully.  I can have a tight curl or a loose bend depending on the size of the rollers and how long I leave them in. It takes a little longer to do my hair than the curling iron did, but my hair is soften and healthier.  And the curl lasts - sometimes overnight.</li>
    <li> I have used the Caruso hair setter for over 15 years.  I have never found any other hair setting device that could produce long lasting curl in my extremely thick and heavy hair.  My first hair setter lasted an amazing 8 years, and I didn&#x27;t have to clean it once!!  Ever since my initial unit, I have had to replace my hair setter (steamer unit) each and every year - sometimes twice a year.  This unit failure (burnout) is with only moderate usage (2-3 times weekly use, monthly cleaning).  While I  do not have any plans on ever switching to a different hair setter, I wish the quality of the newer steamer units was equal or better than the first design that sold in the early 1990s.      The new ionic steamer has a nice new design, and a very handy on/off switch.  I like how the steam is increased when the unit is in ion mode.  However, my unit emits a persistent ticking while in this ionic mode.  The enclosed literature did not specify whether this ticking was good or bad.  My unit seems to function fine - ticking and all - but I have yet to see where the ions actually increase the life of my curls.  In normal/non-ionic mode, my curls last for at least two to three days, depending upon the hairstyle and weather.  I have not been able to hold on to curls longer than a 6-8 hours, in optimum weather, when utilizing the ion feature.  While this is still good in comparison with other hair setters, it is not what I have come to expect from this product.  Sometime over the past few years, I finally retired my original pink rollers that came with my first unit.  After a while, they begin to shed and no longer plump up when steamed.  In 1993, a pack of 10 rollers was $10 at Wal-mart.  The curlers alone can substantiate the price of this unit.  They last, girls.  I promise you that.      I still whole-heartedly recommend this product to anyone who has difficult hair.  I went through countless hot rollers and curling irons before purchasing my first unit in 1993 for a whopping $40.  It has its quirks (unit failure, curl life in ion mode, price), but the steam method is definitely a plus for it is more gentle than hot rollers and curling irons.  I always receive complements on the softness of my curls, and never has the Caruso Hairsetter damaged my hair.  Aside from a few developmental improvements, it is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I have used them for many years. I just purchased a new ionized one. I have very fine hair and I find that while using the ionizing setting my hair does not set at well. It comes out limp and damp. The regular setting is still the greatest and it is like the old fashioned ones. I like the new feature of the off switch. The curlers seem to be made better and more thicker. I love,love  this hair setter. It is the only one that has ever worked for me and curls last for at least 3 days. Now, that is with fine hair the length past my shoulders. If i use hairspray after, the curls can last up to 7 days. the hair also comes out so soft with alot of body too. I would not own any other hair setter. It is just so amazing on what your curls look like. 5 stars for these curlers.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using the Caruso rollers and as a newbie I must say that I am SOOO happy I purchased this item. At first I was skeptic that ionic steam was actually going to curl my medium-long &amp; thick hair, at least not without a heated curling iron. Since my teenage years (and I&#x27;m only 21 now) I&#x27;ve been using curling irons to curl my thick Latina hair. But with that type of heat comes a lot of hair damage and dry split ends. So I decided to seek out a healthier way to get my favorite curls and I heard a lot of positive comments about the Caruso Steam Hairsetter. I have now been using the hair rollers for a little over a month and I get gorgeous long-lasting curls that are perfect. Perfect in both leaving me with healthy, shiny, and proper curls that I love, and perfect in being extremely easy to use and especially long-lasting curls that don&#x27;t even begin to fall for at least 20 hours. I am so happy with this product, no wonder it has been in usage for over 15yrs and constantly highly rated.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Not damaging to the hair.  Unlike hot iron or hot curlers, this product use steam/moisture in the curler sponge to curl the hair, which is great for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;2. Multiple sizes and sufficient number of curler for a wide variety of hairstyle.&lt;br /&gt;3. Create beautiful waves effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. The shield leaves an unsightly straight dent on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;2. The curls do not actually stays for days if you don&#x27;t use styling hair products to hold the look.&lt;br /&gt;3. The time instruction to put curlers on the steamer is very vague in the styling book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After consulting several YouTube tutorial videos, con #1 is resolved by replacing the plastic shield with the double thong clips.  For con #2, however, the curls do look great for 5-6 hours but will start to look tired later in the afternoon if I didn&#x27;t apply any styling foam on my hair before I curl it.  I am still experimenting with issue #3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I really like this product and I am using it every morning.  It only takes about 5 minutes to put the curlers on then I can go on to prepare breakfast among other chores.  I take them off right before I leave home and quickly style it with fingers.  Viola!</li>
    <li> Easy to use!  Works great for my long hair.  Tried it on my 5 year old.  Very simple and quick to curl!</li>
    <li> I bought the C97958 Ionic Steam Hairsetter recently because on product description it is stated \\&quot;The only patented steam hair setting sytem with worldwide dual voltage\\&quot; and I wanted to use it abroad. However on the device I received there is no switch to change the voltage setting. The operating instructions also states \\&quot;OPERATES ONLY AT 120V, 60Hz\\&quot;. The worldwide dual voltage claim appears to be misleading and totally untrue!</li>
    <li> Like most, I was a little apprehensive about trying steam curlers as opposed to curlers you heat up. I have relatively thick medium length hair and normal curlers always end up being too heavy and fall out of my hair. Or the curlers are way too hot and and I burn myself or if you don&#x27;t get it in right it&#x27;s too cool to the touch before you get it set up. I did not have any of these issues with the steam curlers even with first time of trying. I think everyone else has done a great job explaining these but trust me when I say that you will fall in love with these. The other thing I loved was that they have 12 jumbo/large curlers so that you can actually get things done! I hate when there are only 4 of the size that you&#x27;d actually use. Perhaps the most surprising thing to me was that the next day my curls still looked amazing without having to spray on tons of hairspray the day before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always hesitant about rollers and steam rollers and straight/flat-irons - my hair becomes very unhappy with them.  However, I decided to try this set as you were supposed to be able to use it regularly without damage to your hair.  Tell you what, they&#x27;re right!  I use this mostly in the winter, as the combination of cold outside air and dry, warm, inside air do a brittle number on my hair.  It becomes full of static and sounds like it&#x27;s breaking when brushing.  I steam once or twice a week, depending on circumstances, and my hair goes from dry and brittle to soft and silky with added volume and curl.  I&#x27;ve only used the ionic setting, so I don&#x27;t know if the straight-steam setting works as well.  Definitely heat the roller cases before snapping on as it gives a better hold.  I generally use it straight (no products), though I have dried my hair, applied mousse, and the next day, applied a steam treatment with this guy (I can&#x27;t wash my hair daily as it destroys it).  That particular curl lasted incredibly long, though I don&#x27;t care for product residue so much.  However, if you suffer from the winter blues with your hair, try this.  It&#x27;s pretty amazing, easy to use, and so forgiving.  I always get tons of compliments whenever I&#x27;ve freshly steam-treated my hair.  I&#x27;ve also never burned myself or yanked hair out with these rollers, which I have with various other sets.  It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re in the market!</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these many years ago and the foam on my rollers rotted and fell off. You cannot just purchase the foam and for the cost it was less expensive to buy a new unit with ALL the rollers included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ion setting seems to make my hair feel &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; but the regular setting is PERFECT!  I now have short hair so I use all the small rollers and the set lasts for at least two days. When my hair was long and not prone to get oily as quickly, a set would last up to 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO drying my hair out, NO split ends, as soon as it is set, I take the rollers right back out and use the lowest setting on my hair dryer to LIGHTLY dry any moisture from the steam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am able to set and go in less than 15 minutes which is perfect for my 3rd shift lifestyle.  I shower and wash my hair when I get home at 7AM and then I must go to bed for at least 3 hours. If I am going somewhere, I set and go. If not, I go back to bed for another 4 hours before my 10PM shift starts and then set and go to work. Keeps my life simple and &amp;#34;stylish&amp;#34; at the same time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fun part is I rarely set my hair the same way each time. Get creative and just reset if you don&#x27;t like it!</li>
    <li> This is the best hairsetter ever.  It delivers steam to the hair that I&#x27;ll take anyday over direct damaging heat with electric hair curlers or otherwise.  I no longer have to sleep in rollers like I use to.  I have enough time to get up in the mornings for work and take 10 minutes to set my hair and by the time I finish showering, eating breakfast and so on I have a wonderful set.  I have not had any problems with the unit going bad on me, but then again its only been 5 months...so the skeptic in me still wants to wait and see(The reason for 4 instead of 5 stars).  I do highly recommend it though, you will love the way it makes your hair shine.</li>
    <li> I have been using Caruso Rollers since they first came out in the late 80&#x27;s (I think).  I saw the very first infomercial and was intrigued enough to buy them.  I LOVED LOVED LOVED these salt steam rollers.  My super fine straight hair had some serious curls.  I used that setter for 15 years I think.  GREAT product.  And then it broke.  No biggie, I&#x27;ll just buy a new one.  Yeah right.  The new one didn&#x27;t use salt and broke after a year or so.  Then I bought another, it just didn&#x27;t work as well as the original.  Then this ION setter came along.  I was desperate to get my curls back so I bit the bullet and bought it in late November.  The first try my curls came back.  The second use of the product, still working good.  The third time I used it my curls fell out after a few hours and I noticed the steam was not nearly as strong as it was on the first and second use.  The fouth time (today) I barely got enough steam out of it to heat the curler.  What a crock!!!  You know the old saying...If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it?  Well, they shouldn&#x27;t have fixed the first one.  It worked perfectly.  Now I&#x27;m stuck with piece o crap that is broke only 3 months after I bought it.  Oh and to boot...the ION feature is nothing short of annoying with its clicking.  Again, why mess with perfection?  UGH, now I have to try and track down the manufacturer (Amazon has no phone number to share) and try and talk to their customer service and (if they have one) and figure out how to get this exchanged.  don&#x27;t waste your time on this version.  If you can find the earlier one, get that.</li>
    <li> My mother had the old Caruso hairsetter, the one where you had to add salt.  I used to use it all the time in high school and I loved it.  I decided to try this new model, even though I saw a few negative reviews that said it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the old one.  In my opinion, this one is just as good as that old model, if not better, because you don&#x27;t have to add salt.  My hair doesn&#x27;t hold a curl very well, but this hairsetter manages to lock a curl in to even my curl-resistant hair.  The foam rollers are really easy to work with, a lot easier than those velvet-covered hot rollers I was using.  I highly recommend this hairsetter, especially if you have hair that doesn&#x27;t curl easily or hold a curl very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m revising my review because it dawned on me yesterday after I wrote the below original review, that maybe my hair wasn&#x27;t curling because I use moroccan oil in my hair when it&#x27;s wet and then blow dry it and then use the curls. Today, I didn&#x27;t put any product in my hair and used t he curlers and my curls are AMAZING! So, I stand corrected. I retract my old review and replace it with 5 stars. They&#x27;ve lasted through the Florida humidity and everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key Points&lt;br /&gt;-Common complaint is that the jumbo and large rollers are the same. They are NOT the same. The clip size is the same between the two, however the foam thickness is different. Put them side by side and you&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t use oil products in your hair if you&#x27;re going to use the curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t do oil treatments or heavy conditioners in your hair before using curlers. This includes Olive Oil hair wraps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review: I really wanted to like this product. I have long, very thick, semi-course hair and when I read all of the great reviews on this product, I was so excited to get it in the mail. After two weeks of using them daily with variations of time on the steamer, rolled with the clips that came with them or with regular roller clips, variations of time in my hair, used both with a blow dryer and without, used both with hair spray before curling, after, and non at all, etc. I can&#x27;t get my curls to last longer than a few minutes. Within a few minutes, I&#x27;m left with a frizzy, ugly mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not experienced with curlers because of my hair type, but I&#x27;m really disappointed with these. I am returning them and will try something else, probably just regular hot rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did want to note though that some people have said that it comes with 6 jumbo and 6 large and they they are one in the same size. They&#x27;re not. If you look, the clip and the width of the round plastic part of the roller are the same size, however the actual foam part is larger on the jumbo than on the large.on the jumbo than on the large.</li>
    <li> Was everything I was hoping for and it is quick and easy to use. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This item did absolutely nothing for my hair.  I tried the distilled water, nothing.  It was quite depressing, but I should have known better since my hair does nothing in humidity.  If I have curled it with hot rollers and walk out into a humid day it falls instantly.  I had to give it a try, but I returned it.</li>
    <li> I have fine, straight hair. This set actually gives me curls and body that last.  And it is absolutely true - by the tine you get one roller in, the next one is ready. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> This product does curl your hair but, i really didnt like how my hair turned out (it was very poofy and frizzy). Great for those who want volume with curls. Felt like i was hiding behind a bush. totally not recommended for those who have trouble with humidity.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine used these curlers on me for my friends wedding.  I was so impressed, that I immediately had to purchase a set for myself.  I have long, extremely straight hair so my hair does not hold curl well.  The Caruso steam rollers BY FAR held my curls the longest.  They also do not damage your hair like a curling iron or regular curlers.  I highly recommend this product! :)</li>
    <li> I adore my steam curler. The curls last for at least 2 days and my hair is very long, nearly half way to my waist. It works like a little tea kettle and although you put one curler at a time on the top it only takes 15 seconds per curler. They heat up about as fast as I can roll my hair up. Then you steam the plastic holder fir a few seconds and snap in place.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was on a trip recently and wanted to curl my hair but I couldn&#x27;t  find them in stores so I bought a new ion curler that took almost 20 minutes to warm up. I would have been out the door by then with the steam setter and my hair wouldn&#x27;t have been slightly burnt.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The steam curlers seems really gentle on my hair and I never get my hair tangled in the rollers (they are soft foam).</li>
    <li> Steam hairsetters are great for making smooth, shiny curls in my wavy and somewhat frizzy hair.  I love this one because it has 30 rollers in 5 different sizes and you can buy more of any size you want.  I think that the jumbo rollers are the largest-sized rollers of any steam hairsetter on the market. &lt;br /&gt;The covers that hold on the rollers don&#x27;t work too well, though.  They leave a dent in your curl and sometimes the roller slips.  I solved that by using some of those spring loaded ponytail clips  instead of the roller covers.</li>
    <li> I have used the Caruso curlers for years and years. By using steam your hair does not dry out and has lasting body.</li>
    <li> Love the rollers.  Easy to use and curl hair quickly.</li>
    <li> I love it and will buy it again if necessary!! It is soooo fast!!! 10 seconds to heat your rollers, gentle on hair, long lasting curls,&lt;br /&gt;I can put hair in ponytail, curl it, put makeup on, take rollers out and get complements. Fast, quick, easy, good for your hair!</li>
    <li> I received this product in December as a gift.  I just tried it this evening and the unit is broken.  It just makes a clicking noise and does not heat up or steam up.  I am dissappointed as I have used these Caruso Rollders once before many years ago and I wore the old one out.  I am trying to get a hold of the seller to send back for either a new one or refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope everyone else is having luck with their Caruso C97958 Professional ION Steam Hairsetter.</li>
    <li> Need much bigger rollers and enough to do a whole head. the jumbo rollers are not big enough for long hair and you need the same size for the whole head. wish they made a set with at least 10-12 super jumbo rollers and heat up at the same time. that would be a winner!!!!</li>
    <li> Just used it for the first time. Easy to use. Curls came out really nicely. The small rollers stucka little to the steamer, but no other issues.</li>
    <li> Let me begin by telling you about my hair type and you will understand why i&#x27;m in love with this hair setter. I naturally have fine hair with a slight wave to it, and to make matters more complicated (because that&#x27;s what us women do lol) i dye my hair platinum blonde. So my naturally fine hair is also very heat sensitive and prone to breakage.  I&#x27;ve tried every single hair setter out there along with every type of thermal heat shielding spray and they all ended with with horrible results. Sure my hair looked nice for the evening, but it paid dearly for it in the long run. Heat was my enemy. The only way i could curl my hair without damaging it was by wet setting it, and i don&#x27;t always have the time for it.  But with this steam hair setter, wow... Im in love! The machine heats up very quickly and rollers are ready to put into your hair under 5 seconds. My hair is not only super shinny afterwards but the curls are impressively long lasting! The next day my hair was still holding the curls. I also want to add that im a fan of vintage and retro hair styles, and i usually prefer tighter curls for most looks and this definitely delivers! A must-have for all women with chemically treated hair!</li>
    <li> Love love love! Super easy to use and fast too. Curls could last till next wash. I have long hair so I use the jumbo size curler which I bought extra . Curls are big and bouncy.</li>
    <li> I have personally used this product since 1992 when I bought it from an infomerical. I received my second one in 2000 for a Xmas present because I wanted the newer version that did not use salt. I gave my 1992 to my sister and as far as I know it&#x27;s still working. I love it. I am african american and my hair is naturally thick and kinky. On my relaxed hair it curls beautifully and lasts for days. The steam does not damage my hair like regular heat does. If it works on my thick hair it should work on anything if used properly. It produces steam within a minute of being turned on.  I just put one roller on the post, count from 8-10 depending on the current of the steam, shake it off then roll it. I am done in 10 minutes and can immediately take out the first roller to reveal my curls. There is no way it takes five minutes for one roller. In 5 minutes, I am half way done rolling! My rollers are dead so I went to purchase another set last night and couldn&#x27;t find it in the store so I bought a regular ion roller set. It sucks. It took 15 min just to heat up and didn&#x27;t curl my hair nearly as well. It&#x27;s going back. Now that I have found I can still order Caruso online I will do so after typing this review.</li>
    <li> I had a Caruso curler years ago and was so happy when I saw it was still available.  It is quick, easy, reliable, and effective.</li>
    <li> I cannot survive in civilization without this product and still look like a human being!  After Katrina when we had nothing here on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, including no stores, the only thing I texted my friends to sends was a Caruso ION Steam Hairsetter.  (We had no phone service or electricity for weeks, either, but I didn&#x27;t want to be without a hair setter even if I couldn&#x27;t use it.)  It works so well that my set can hold sometimes for 2 or 3 days.  It&#x27;s extremely easy to use.  I like the clicking -- it helps me remember to turn it off or unplug it when I&#x27;m finished and thus not risk a housefire by leaving it plugged in.  No salt needed like the old models required.  Easy to take on trips.  So the next time you feel the need to donate something to a disaster area such as a flooded area or the California fires, send one of these.  We had lots of food and clothing sent here, but no hair setters, and who can look good without their Caruso ION steam hairsetter?!&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Simone</li>
    <li> I have been using the steam hairsetter for two weeks now and really like it. I have gotten numerous compliments on my new curly look (from guys and girls alike), and it&#x27;s much safer for my hair than using a curling iron--plus it lasts longer.    I am African American with relaxed hair that just skims the top of my shoulders. I&#x27;ve discovered that an all-over set with medium-sized rollers works well for me. I use one of those headbands with the teeth and a clasp in the back to pull my hair off my face.     Many reviewers have indicated the sets last for days. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t sleep well on such hairstyles, so I have to do it over everyday. However, with a bit of practice, I have been able to set my hair, blow dry it, and remove the rollers in about 25 minutes.    RECOMMENDATION: Order a couple extra sets of rollers at the same time you purchase the steamer because it doesn&#x27;t come with enough to set your hair with all one size. Depending on how curly you want your hair to be, I recommend getting at least two more sets (6 each) of the medium or large rollers ([[ASIN:B000O2NR6I Caruso Professional Caruso Extra rollers medium (674902)]] or [[ASIN:B000O2K75M Caruso Professional Caruso Extra rollers large (674903)]]). Plus, I use the wave clips instead of the roller clips that come with the steamer (wave clips are usually silver, and I found a set of 12 on the hair and beauty aisle at my local grocery store). The roller clips leave creases, whereas the wave clips don&#x27;t and allow the hair to dry faster.    RECOMMENDATION: When setting the hair, try using a little moisturizer or shine gel on the ends. My hair usually doesn&#x27;t frizz, but after using the steam rollers, the ends frizzed a little; I assume it was because of the steam. Rubbing a little bit of shine gel on the ends before rolling my hair solved the problem.    My only criticism: you can only enjoy this product if you actually get it in working order! The first time I ordered it, the post that holds the rollerin place on the steam unit was broken off. Plus, the steam unit wasn&#x27;t functioning properly. To Amazon&#x27;s credit, they overnighted a replacement at no further cost to me. Unfortunately, the post on THAT one was broken too! Plus, neither one had the right mix of rollers in them! It says it comes with 6 each of petite, small, medium, large, and jumbo rollers, but neither package contained any large rollers at all. VERY irritating! Thankfully, the roller post isn&#x27;t an absolute necessity; you just have to be a little more deliberate about placing the roller directly over the steam.    If not for these issues, I would&#x27;ve given it an overall rating of 5.</li>
    <li> I have used this product since I was 19 and I&#x27;m now 37.  It curls well and fast.  The ionic setting isn&#x27;t a favorite of mine so I have given it 4 stars, but I like the fact that you no longer have to use salt!</li>
    <li> i have been using this product since early 90,i have bought different types of hair setters, but i always come back to Caruso hair setters.  the curl stays longer and solfter,and don&#x27;t dry your hair out.  I would advice any lady that uses hair setters try caruso, once you do  your hooked far life,thanks far a wonderfull product                                                   kerrycook</li>
    <li> I have used a Caruso steam hairsetter on my hair since they first came out.  I can use this hairsetter and my hair stays set for days!  I find that it works perfectly if I count slowly to 20 while the curler is on the steamer.  I then leave the curlers in for at least 15 minutes.  Don&#x27;t brush it out for another 15-30 minutes to make sure it is completely dry.  I always receive compliments on my hair when I use my Caruso curlers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to return this please it didnt meet my expectations or needs.</li>
    <li> I tried the hairsetter on mine and my daughters hair. The curls were not as tight as the original hairsetter and the loud clicking noise that the unit makes is annoying. Also, if you try and use it without the Ion feature it does not produce enough steam. I can&#x27;t use them in the morning because the ticking sound will wake up my kids. I like the original better but for the price and the amount of rollers you get it is a good deal.</li>
    <li> I bought these because the price was low and I thought they would be much healthier for my hair than an iron, since they use steam. I&#x27;m only fifteen, but this was probably the smartest decision of my life. I haven&#x27;t fried my hair with a straightener or a curling iron since I bought these! They take some getting used to, and I hated them the first two times I used them. However, the third time, I must have done something right, because I loved the outcome!! Ever since then, I don&#x27;t have a negative word to say. They leave crease-less, bouncy curls that last all day long. Also, the best thing is that the curls are shiny and healthy, not dull and burnt! I definitely recommend these. :)</li>
    <li> This is my third Caruso ION Steam Hairsetter.  Okay, the first one I received second-hand from my daughter as I had borrowed it from her and never gave it back!!  Approximately three years after I \\&quot;borrowed\\&quot; it I replaced it with the newer one that required no salt added to the water.  This second hairsetter lasted about 5-6 years.  I use my Caruso Hairsetter at least twice a week!  I have very fine thin hair and it&#x27;s the only hairsetter that does NOT burn my scalp!!! The curls will last approximately 3 days.  Gotta love that!!</li>
    <li> It is fine, as described, and works properly, is only one small detail that I do not like: heating rolls one by one, its take long time to get it done.</li>
    <li> I am a licensed Cosmetologist, who has now gone into a different field. However, I still do hair on the side. I remembered that we used Caruso back when I worked in the salon about 15 years ago. I was pleasantly surprised that it was still available today. I used it recently for my cousin&#x27;s First Communion, &amp; her hair came out perfect. It took me, maybe 10 minutes maximum, to set her whole head. It was easy on her 7 year old hair, and the style lasted all day. Needless to say, she &amp; her mother were thrilled with the quick &amp; easy process, &amp; the lasting results. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Caruso Steam rollers for years. They are better for your hair than a curling iron and just easier to work with.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time. I have the original that is slowly dying after over a decade of use. Looking forward to the same with this fantastic product as well.</li>
    <li> I love my Caruso.  It really is easy to use, nice to my hair, and quick.  No more burnt ears!  It would be nice to have more jumbo rollers instead of the tiny ones, but I am able to set my medium length thick hair with a combination of jumbos and large, and it comes out fine.  As others have said, I have curl left the next day.</li>
    <li> I love the Caruso steam curlers. They work really well and condition my hair while making it curly. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> This product works well, but the smell of plastic is overwhelming. I am concerned about the long term health effects of anything that smells so strongly of plastic, and sends very strong fumes into the air. I ran the unit outside several times to try to get rid of the fumes, but they were still horrible. I do not recommend this product at all!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome hair setter that gives fantastic results and it&#x27;s very easy to use; however, the only problem is that I am not able to have the curls stay in my hair longer than 2 hours. My hair gets a lot of volume and is bouncy and has very pretty soft curls but they don&#x27;t last longer than 2 hours even after putting hairspray on. So I guess it depends on your hair and the curls may stay longer on your hair if you naturally have curly hair but for wavy/straight hair gals, the curls just don&#x27;t last longer than couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the fact that the steam does not damage the hair at all and my hair does look shinier and healthier but I just wish I was able to make the curls last longer!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my recent purchase of the Caruso Steam Hairsetter &amp; rollers. It certainly leaves my hairstyle lasting longer than with the electric rollers.  It takes minutes to set your hair &amp; I feel that my hair is not being damaged.  I highly recommend the steam setter &amp; rollers to anyone with either short or long hair. The various size of rollers enables you to get the kind of hairstyle you desire. The shorter rollers for a curlier look, the larger ones for a softer, but long lasting hairdo.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used rollers for years but decided to try these because curling with a hot iron was drying my hair out badly at the ends now that I have grown it longer.  The first time I used these, the first curl I unrolled sprang up and hit me in the forehead!  I am learning how to use them to get the tightness of curl I want.  I like them because my hair is no longer dry and brittle at the ends and looks healthier.  I have the snap on clips that came with the set and have not had any problems with them.  I wish they would have included some of the other type of clips so I could have tried them as well.  Other than my skills at rolling and styling, I have no complaints about the set and it heats up really fast so I can touch up quickly if I need to.</li>
    <li> For a long time i want curl my hair without heat and hair product. This is easy, fast(15Min) and makes hair super soft and curls last at least for 3 days. Best buy in a long time!!! Dont know why took me so long to find this curler</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m into pinup styles and these are perfect. Soft curls and they stay a long time, even without hairspray. The different sizes are perfect.</li>
    <li> This works great for my super fine and straight hair. It is less damaging than curling irons. When I use this people think I had my hair done. Tip: use this to avoid the line impression the clip can leave on your hair [[ASIN:B000R87B1Q B000R87B1Q]]</li>
    <li> I have had Caruso curlers since they first came on the market many years ago. At that time you had to add salt.  I have had probably four sets.  The last two sets burned out fairly quickly. I used regular tap water, and ours is very hard.  I am being exta careful with this new set to empty the water after every use and only using bottled water. They work great, I just hope they last.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product!  My hair is to the middle of my back and very thick.  I can actually get the nice loose curls that I like and they will stay in all day -I can even still see some curl the next day.  I don&#x27;t even have to use hairspray or setting lotion.  My hair always feels so soft and healthy after using these!     With other rollers, I have to use at least 20 large or jumbo rollers and they never give you enough so I have to buy two hot roller units.  I did have to order some extra jumbo rollers with this steam setter (which was no big deal), but I only have to use 12 rollers which makes it quicker and easier and the curls come out perfect. I don&#x27;t mind that it comes with a variety of sizes that you may not use because I may decide to get creative with my hair one day and use them! I just keep the ones that I don&#x27;t use and the instruction manual in the original box and I keep the unit and the ones that I do use in the bag that comes with it within easier reach.    I will say that I do have to leave the rollers on the steamer longer than it says (I do 20 to 25 seconds), and I also steam the clip. I also, just for extra hold and to save time, I run a hot blow dryer over the curlers (but not enough to damage), then put it on cool and cool it off and dry for a couple of minutes being sure to get in between the curlers. I can usually take them out immediately.     Some people don&#x27;t like that it only steams one at a time. I don&#x27;t really mind it so much.  The best way to do it to save time after you have sectioned your hair into the main sections is:     1. Put the roller on the steamer while you are getting a section of hair     to roll and combing it out to make it smooth (just take your time so     it has plenty of time to steam and count to 20 or so).      2.  While holding the hair to be rolled with one hand, use your other       hand to pick up the roller off the steamer and then put a clip onto        the steamer that will steam while you are rolling. Then roll the       hair.     3.  While you are holding the rolled curl with one hand, use your other       hand to pick up the clip off the steamer and put on another curler to      start steaming for your next curl. Then put the clip over the roller.    4.  Start getting your next section of hair ready to roll while the roller      is on the steamer and continue to follow the above pattern.  This way,      not much time is wasted waiting for rollers to steam!</li>
    <li> This product is ok.  I bought it because I like the steam action, however for my type of hair, thick, super straight,long asian hair, it worked ok. Once I got the hang of how long to leave it on the steamer (15 - 20 sec) and how much hair to wind into each jumbo roller (too much and it won&#x27;t curl properly), it is super easy to use and fast.  However, I would need to leave it in for 20 - 30 min. and only the bottom part would curl, which is fine with me, but the curls didn&#x27;t last very long, a couple of hours max.  I have hot rollers and my curls would last longer.      The Ion setting is annoying with the clicking noise, I use it without it and it still works fine.  I like the compact size and the number of rollers they give you.  The only thing is the Jumbo and Large rollers are the same size, which is fine with me since I use those anyway.  You just don&#x27;t need extra rollers jumbo rollers, because the set comes with 12 already (6 large + 6 jumbo).      This product may work better for people with different types of hair.</li>
    <li> I used the Caruso rollers 2-3 times a week and always emptied the water and kept the unit clean. I was vacationing in Aruba and planned on using the rollers on my hair as well as my friend&#x27;s hair. Alas, plugged the unit in and nothing, the heating unit was dead. I had only had the rollers for four months. When I purchased the rollers, I read many reviews and several people stated that their rollers had also \\&quot;died\\&quot; after only limited use. I certainly did not expect to be one of them. I would never purchase a Caruso product  again and have since purchased Vidal Sassoon steam rollers.</li>
    <li> When the Caruso Hairsetter came out in the 90&#x27;s, I bought it after watching an info-mercial.  The ads promised that your curls would last for days. And it was true.  Now, the product doesn&#x27;t seem as well made; the curlers fall apart more easily, and the sponge on the curlers doesn&#x27;t hold up as long.  And most importantly, the curls don&#x27;t last like they did previously.  But I&#x27;d still rather use this product than go back to hot rollers, which burn your fingers and take longer to use.</li>
    <li> I love the Caruso Steam Hairsetter.  This is the third one I have had through out the last 20 years.  My hair stays healthier using this product than curling irons.</li>
    <li> I was slightly underwhelmed with these. I read all the reviews and watched all the tutorials online and was really excited to try them out, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m thrilled with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do curl my hair, but they take WAY to long to dry. The last time I used them I left them in for 3 hours and used my blow dryer the last 30 minutes and my hair still wasn&#x27;t completely dry, that pretty much insures that the curls don&#x27;t last more than 5 minutes. I&#x27;ll keep trying, but right now I&#x27;ll have to say I&#x27;m pretty &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; about these.</li>
    <li> This is my third Caruso Hairsetter.  I still have the old add salt unit and it still works. I up graded to a non-salt unit and it worked for years. We moved to an area with much harder water. I should have been using distilled water here, the unit stopped working.  This is my third Caruso Hairsetter.  The first ion unit I have tried.  LOVE it! I have long fine blonde hair.  It is easy to curl but hard for a style to last.  But with this product I have no problem.  Also, to me it take very little time.  Start up time is short.  In the morning I put my hair in rollers (10), put my make-up on, take out rollers - done in less than 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> These things were total junk.  Very cheaply made.  The rollers were just plactic spools with sponge surrounding them.  They loose their heat within a few seconds.  Did nothing for my hair.  I&#x27;m throwing the whole thing away.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed with this purchase. The curl does not hold and the rollers are not easy to set. I was expecting more moisture to smooth out my dry ends but this product actually creates more frizz for my hair.</li>
    <li> Fast, long-lasting curls for my thin, shoulder length hair. Thank you for an easy way to style with great results!!!</li>
    <li> I love these curlers and this is the second time I&#x27;ve bought them.  I, too, had the old model where you added salt. The pink sponge part of that set finally disentigrated.   I&#x27;m not convinced this model is better but I had to use Jumbo curlers when I need Large.  For some reason I got 12 Jumbo curlers and NO Large curlers (should have been 6 of each).  I&#x27;m going to write the company and see if their customer service is as good as their curlers!   I have medium length, fine, whimpy hair, and they make me look like I have a head of hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the steam hairsetter for just over a year and haven&#x27;t had any problems until the switch broke off.  So disappointed.  It would be a great product if they used better quality plastic.</li>
    <li> I love these Caruso steam curlers; so much more effective than a curling iron or dry heat curlers.  Leaves my hair full of springy waves and curls that really last even in high humidity.  Very easy to use and a good variety of sizes.</li>
    <li> I just returned this product after using for nearly a month. I really wanted it to work. It made my medium length somewhat thick hair very silky and shiny but it took too long to roll up, my arms got very tired. I learned not to leave the sponge rollers on the steam too long - if you do it will take a very long time to dry. There were positive things about it - like very healthily looking, shiny, soft hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my hair is easy to manage and is usually soft. There was a lot of static electricity after each use which was annoying. I had trouble getting and keeping my already soft hair wrapped on the roller. I absolutely hated the plastic shields as I felt I had to keep my head perfectly steady during the drying time or they would and did unroll- use a hair dryer to speed things up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took too much time organizing rollers by size &amp; taking off the shields before using and then putting things away. I was amazed that I never used up the water when I filled it to the MAX FILL line so you need not worry about having to refill it - no matter how slow you are. I used my smartphone timer to get the exact number of seconds - that is important.</li>
    <li> This hair curler is great for my hair and it is fast . I like how it curls fast and lasts all day. I get great compliments and everyone at work wants to know what I use.  My daughter even enjoys it .It&#x27;s much better that burning your hair with a metal hair curler.</li>
    <li> I love this product - it is so easy to use and QUICK!!!  Lovely holding waves and curls with no effort.  It is just so easy - even before a morning coffee...</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd Caruso ION Steam Hairsetter I have owned.  I actually still have my original (hot steam) one that I purchased in the 1990s, still in working condition.  I purchased the travel one about two years ago but that burned out within a few months.  Still these hairsetters are fast, easy to use and produce full curls that last until a shampoo. They also leave your hair in great condition. No dry ends, etc.  I would highly recommend purchasing one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Caruso steamsetter products since around 1993.This product is amazing, the curls last and last.This method of curling hair is non-damaging.I would highly recommend getting this product if you care about your locks!</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with the way the Caruso Ion Steam Haisetter works. I had an older model w/o ion setting before. It used salt to heat up. This one you fill, plug in &amp; start setting your hair.   I no longer use all the styling gels, sprays or mouse. I may not have to get a perm agan.   This leaves my hair soft and the curls last all day. My hair has quite a bit of grey in it now so holding curl is very important.  I set my hair, get dressed, finger brush my hair &amp; I&#x27;m on my way. I have left the curlers in for as little as 8 min to over 20 min. I have not been disappointed in either case.  If you have hard to curl hair, hate standing w/a blowdryer or curling iron this is the product for you.  I hope you love it as much as I do.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be so easy to use and best of all it does not damage my hair!! The rollers are ready to use in seconds and you can leave these in for 15 minutes or longer - but for light curls, you could take them out in five minutes! Highly recommend - easy to use and really works... curls stay all day long</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had hair down to my waiste, and now it&#x27;s shoulder length.  Used it when it was long and loved it, using it again now.  Lost half my hair a couple of years ago, decided to go short and threw it away.  Hate short hair, so went online and ordered a new one.  As usual love it a lot.  My original required a dash of salt added to the water, this one doesn&#x27;t.  Still do it and no big deal, just old enough to stick with what works.  Love this machine, and it&#x27;s much more compact now.</li>
    <li> Get great curls effortlessly by using this product.  No frizz, no hassle, easy to use, and works quickly.  All you need is water and an outlet to plug it into.  It heats up quickly and makes nice curls depending upon the size of the rollers that you use.  I did not give it 5 stars because of the rollers that come with it.  They send you a selection of 6 each of all of the sizes.  Considering that I have short hair, I will never use the very big rollers and they are a waste to me.  I would much rather have liked choosing what size rollers that it should come with so that I can get the size that I needed.  So now I need to order more rollers of the size that is good for me and that is another expense.</li>
    <li> I purchased it after watching a YouTube tutorial on how to get natural curls and was searching for it high and low as it isn&#x27;t available at stores in Singapore. I don&#x27;t regret taking so much trouble just to get my hands on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had so many compliments about my hair whenever I use this curler to get my hair done.</li>
    <li> Have tried twice with mixed results. Not sure if its my hair, or if the product just doesn&#x27;t work well, but the curls don&#x27;t seem to be holding very long.  I now just use it for giving my bangs a little curl in the morning and smooth down baby hairs / flyaways.</li>
    <li> Could not be more happy with it. The caruso is the only thing I have found that works on my hair without damaging it. It was like new. Arrived fast.</li>
    <li> This has been a no fail favorite set of hair rollers for myself back in the 80&#x27;s as well as present for my daughter, age 10. The curls are quick and long lasting.</li>
    <li> I ordered this hairsetter and when I got it, the box was beat up and 2 curlers were missing. The curlers were thrown into a plastic bag. I reached out to the company,(I Need Stuff ),and they apologized saying they would send me another one. The second one was worst than the first. There was hair caught around the rollers and one was cracked with a piece of scotch tape on it. Not Happy!!!! However, Amazon was extremely helpful!</li>
    <li> I gave less than five stars with a reservation. I have used the Caruso Steam Hairsetter since they first came out in the 80&#x27;s. I have always pleased with the curl and the fact that my hair has never sustained damaged that is done with dry irons or rollers. My hair is very fine, pale blonde and does not keep a curl long. The Caruso steam curlers has worked better than even standard curlers and is super fast. Altogether an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the new ION setter and for the most part, I am as pleased with it as I have been with the other Caruso setters from the past. I do like the fact that this model has an off and on switch, which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However one thing that definitely is a down side to this setter...what in the world is with that annoying clicking when the ion setting is turned on? There is absolutely no reason for it to be there. It serves absolutely no purpose. It is loud completely useless and unnecessary. I and my cats like quiet mornings when I get ready for work and who wants to hear that loud irritating clicking like an old fashioned time bomb when they are drinking their morning coffee? The cats looked at it like it was about to go off and kept a discreet distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a small red indicator light to show when the ion setting is utilized which makes the clicking even more idiotic and nonsensical. If the inventors at Caruso thought this ridiculous added bell and whistle was an advantage or cool, the moron who made the decision to add this to an otherwise excellent product should find another line of employment, perhaps in goofy sound effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working women want a convenient product that works,,,plain and simple. Just curl your hair and be done with it. If you choose to purchase this model, you will soon dispense with the ion setting. Otherwise the product performs as well as my other Caruso steam rollers in the past.</li>
    <li> This was ordered as a gift.  I did try them after she had used them.  I can see they add a lot of body to her hair.  The shipping was fast and easy....no problems.</li>
    <li> I regret buying this.  My curls come out not looking as good as when I curl with my ceramic curling iron.  I don&#x27;t see a difference in how long the curls last.</li>
    <li> I purchased these outside Amazon a couple years back.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy these again.  I find that these still dry the hair out and if your hair is very long will break it off.  Not sure if there are any heated rollers that won&#x27;t make the hair brittle.  These are no different.</li>
    <li> I can remember having one of these when they first came out around 20 years ago. Mine lasted about 15 years or so before it burnt out and I loved the way that the steam conditioned my hair. So when I needed a gift for a teenaged girl, I thought of this. Purchased this and additional rollers because she has very, very long hair but she is able to put her thigh length hair up in about 16 rollers using the small and medium rollers. She loves the curl she gets and the way it makes her hair feels. She had used Hot Sticks for years but will no longer because she knows that this is much better for her hair and works as well, if not better. Because of the length of her hair, the curl doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as some reviewers state their curl lasts but it holds up long enough to get through the day. She&#x27;s happy so I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> I have straight, fine, long hair. It likes being straight. But I like it curled…or at least with more body than it naturally has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Caruso steam system is the only one I have found that actually curls my hair well with curls that last for hours…and it does so without any damage to the hair and without using 10 lbs of product. The first one I bought was in the mid 90&#x27;s. It lasted for several years. The second one I bought finally pooped out on me a few weeks ago. This is my 3rd in 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had not had the ION steamer before and yes, the loud, repetitive ticking noise can drive one mad if left on long enough, but it helps motivate me to get those babies in! I agree with a few other reviewers- a cold shot of air before you take them out is helpful as is spraying them with a bit of hairspray before you shake out the curls. But, this is the best machine I have had. In fact,  the day it broke, I had to go to a salon to get my hair curled for a holiday work party. The stylist did it with this new gadget that looks like a small hair dryer and sucks in small portions and bakes them. It is supposedly the newest, best thing for curls. Not only did it burn my head a few times, the curls fell out during the party- even with a bleep load of product and hairspray. I used my trusty new Caruso for New Year&#x27;s Eve and the curls stayed in through the night and I was left with a ton of body and a few waves the next day without much product in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you go Caruso Steam, you won&#x27;t go back!</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Caruso and I&#x27;m still a big fan. After my last one quit working decided to go back to using the curling iron. It only took me a week to order a new one. The only drawback I&#x27;ve found is they only last a year or two.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed and wanted - am so pleased.  The steam is great - no frizz, just curls.    Hair stays soft and easy to manage - plus shiny..    Am very pleaed..</li>
    <li> I was surprised that the roller configuration was not the same as listed. I received 18 jumbo rollers instead of the medium and large as stated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a convert! Used to use my GHD Straightener to curl my hair but never got the &amp;#34;bounce&amp;#34; I wanted. With this I put my hair through minimal strain (it&#x27;s the steam that curls it, not the heat, after all). It&#x27;s quick to steam and very quick to curl your hair, even if you do have to place the roller on the machine one by one. Great item!</li>
    <li> I love these steam rollers.  You don&#x27;t worry about damaging your hair.</li>
    <li> I was using velcro rollers to get some curl in my hair, but it was taking too long to set my hair still damp then use the blow dryer to dry and set. I tried hot rollers, but didn&#x27;t get enough curl. Then I found these. Easy to use, sets quickly, and the curls last. Gave it only four stars because my first set came with the curler holding pin broken off the unit. Also, it would be nice if the rollers were color coded. I use the jumbo and large rollers and at quick glance it&#x27;s hard to tell them apart. However, the set I get on my curls is definitely five stars.</li>
    <li> I love how this hair setter curls my hair. Very easy to use, just need regular water and just let it set for few minutes, and next thing, nice curls!</li>
    <li> Have only used a couple of times but I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this because I wanted to give my hair a break from the heat of my flat iron, in addition I wanted to replicate that &amp;#34;salon look&amp;#34; that I&#x27;m unable to achieve with the flat iron. This is fast and easy to use...highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> This product works well to curl your hair and is fast and easy to use. You hair is silky soft from the steam.</li>
    <li> I have used the Caruso Hairsetter for years!!!  I have tried other types of electric rollers, but none compare to these.  These leave long lasting curls!!!  I love these rollers and so will anyone that buys them!!!  I had to buy a new set because mine finally wore out after years of use.  If you are looking for electric hair rollers, I highly suggest these!!!!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> My hair: shoulder-length, soft, not straight but not wavy, extremely thick--I have A LOT of hair.  Drying with hairdryer is 45 minutes minimum.&lt;br /&gt;Curl results: lots of great spiral curls if the smaller rollers are used, large/jumbo didn&#x27;t offer a lot of volume for my already-thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to dream of big, luscious, bouncy curls--turns out my extremely thick, wavy hair feels otherwise.  Living in the humid southeast, no amount of hairspray will make the curls stay.  The Caruso is not as time-consuming to use as one would think, and relatively easy.  With the option to purchase extra rollers (which I did), it all but guarantees you won&#x27;t run out of curlers--like you would with an ordinary hot roller set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual unit makes a clicking sound when in the \\&quot;ion\\&quot; mode, it&#x27;s a bit alarming at first but then you get used to it.  Apparently my unit does not work in \\&quot;regular\\&quot;mode, as the on/off indicator light doesn&#x27;t even come on.  Oh well, I guess I&#x27;ll just stick to the ionic mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as curls go--yeah, you do get some great curls that last longer than using hot rollers/curling iron.  After a full evening out and then going to bed, I woke up not with spirally curls but nice waves that lasted into the afternoon.  Whether it was the steam rollers or the insane amount of hairspray I used, I&#x27;m not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The styling booklet that came with the set was painfully 80s and 90s, so I watched umpteen tutorial videos on YouTube about getting \\&quot;Victoria&#x27;s Secret Waves,\\&quot; and this tween-age girl made it look so easy!  Unfortunately for me, it&#x27;s either my lack of hairstyling talent or roller-strategy, but what I got was far from VS model-hair.  4 stars to start out, because I&#x27;m not sure it made my hair shinier/reduced frizz.  A good investment if you love being a girly-girl and styling your hair, b/c it&#x27;s a lot of fun to use.</li>
    <li> I have the version without the ION steam and that product is still going strong.  I love it so much that I got this version as a gift. It&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These steam rollers take just a second to heat up and are ready to go.  Nothing gives body to my bay fine hair except these steam rollers. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I used the Caruso hair system from the 90&#x27;s and loved it.  My hair has changed after chemo and I&#x27;m finally letting it grow out after 3 years.  It has lost it&#x27;s natural curl and this is the only way I can get fast curls with moisture and not the drying heat.  I do need to use the small and petite rollers for a little tighter curl so I bought 6 extra rollers of each.</li>
    <li> Have always loved this item, it&#x27;s fast, easy and I can do my hair in no time with long lasting curls!</li>
    <li> I have thin,graying hair, and this hairsetter is the only thing that works on it.  It is so quick, and it only took two tries for me to get the hang of using it!  My hair is so thin that I use spring clips instead of the covers provided, because I don&#x27;t have enough hair for them to hold onto my head.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and I seriously look like a drown sewer rat when I go out in public.  I am 31 years old and this is my first experience with using hair curlers.  Not only does it work way better than expected, but I also doubled my volume just by having these curls!  I no longer look flat and greasy on my head and am getting tons of compliments.  Heats up each curler in seconds and my hair is fully curled in 20 minutes.  Curls stay in for a few days, can you believe that?? It&#x27;s so easy to use.  Since my hair is fine, the foam helps wrap my hair around it.  It comes with a handbook to show which curler sizes to use and where to place them for different styles.  Came with a cute heavy duty plastic bag to carry them around in.</li>
    <li> I have a relative who swears by these things for taking the frizz out of her hair, evening out her waves, and giving her shine. I have very porous, frizzy hair, and all this set did was make it frizz more. It didn&#x27;t even out anything, and it definitely didn&#x27;t give my hair shine. I gave this set to said relative, who is now a very happy said relative.</li>
    <li> I just received the Caruso C97958 ION Steam Hairsetter and have used it 3 times so far. I have fine, shoulder length hair. I wanted more volume. After reading some of the reviews I was skeptical, but these curlers work very well. I use the jumbo rollers, and depending on how long I leave them in, I get volume and curls. I use mousse, blow dry my hair, put the curlers in, and I leave them in for 10-20 mins. The curls/body last all day and into the next.</li>
    <li> Love it! Have bee pleased with Caruso for years before this one.  Anxious to see how the ion feature works, needed to upgrade as some of the curlers have finally worn out in my other set.</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;ion&amp;#34; hair curler does not work well. I read all of the directions, followed them carefully. I rolled my daughter&#x27;s hair, and waited the proper amount of time. I then unrolled my daughter&#x27;s hair and the curl fell right out immediately without even touching it. The rollers are hard to use as they require water and you must steam each roller and clip separately. They do not stay very well in the hair without flopping around. The ion steamer itself actually makes an annoying clicking noise as you use it. The basic point is that the curl did not set.</li>
    <li> I only use Caruso curls.  I ordered this one because my other one quit working.  This one has three hairline cracks on the top.  I can&#x27;t send it back because I need to use it every day.  Please check your merchandise before shipping out.  I&#x27;m just bummed.</li>
    <li> The best Ion Steam hairsetter. I have very thin hair and this is the only setter that worked for me.</li>
    <li> i really like these &amp;#34;steam rollers&amp;#34;.  They head up very quickly and curl my very straigt hair quicky also.  I like the different size rollers too.  It took me a few times to experiment with what size to use and how long to leave them in but I&#x27;ve found them to be pretty easy to use now.</li>
    <li> I have thick straight hair.  These would not curl my hair.</li>
    <li> Hard to use.  Plastic clips are difficult and probably will break easily.  Most of rollers are huge and can&#x27;t use them with my short hair.  The big ones take up a whole shelf in my storage. Should throw them away but can&#x27;t bring myself to do that.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on fine thin hair</li>
    <li> Over the years I have had 2 of these.  My original Caruso is still useable!  It was larger and you had to use salt to make it steam.  I used the second one for 10 years before it stopped steaming quickly. This model is very small and steams quickly. It is small enough to pack in a suitcase and comes with an assortment of rollers.  If you want body in your hair and cannot use the new irons out there, this is for you!  This will never burn or harm your hair.  I hope they never quit making these!!!!!</li>
    <li> this is my first set of rollers and i love them! they are so easy to use and they dont fry my hair!</li>
    <li> I have been a user of this product since it first came out...and I wasn&#x27;t too sure of the new design only because of being used to the \\&quot;older model\\&quot;...it was everything I was hoping for and then some. My 1st one lasted me atleast 10+ years, and it was the best $19.99 I have spent on just about anything. This product does EXACTLY what it says it does and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the new design. I love not having to add salt anymore. Thank you for another great purchase Caruso!</li>
    <li> The set looks great.  I had owned one many many years ago, but the foam curlers are nearly totally squished.  Love the new curlers, but the new unit does not heat up enough to set a good curl.  Haven&#x27;t added salt like I had to with the last heat unit but .....should I have to???</li>
    <li> Did not work on my Asian fine straight hair.</li>
    <li> easy to use and adds tons of volume</li>
    <li> The product works well is long as you don&#x27;t have the ION  part on. I wonder if there is a way to turn the clicking off and still use the ION</li>
    <li> This was my second purchase of the Caruso steam hair curlers system.  My hair is fine and lacks body and the steam curlers set the curl which lasts a couple of days.  The only thing that I&#x27;d like to see is that they allow you to pick the size rollers you order with your system because the jumbo rollers are good for long hair and my hair is not long so they are unused.  The system is sent with a pre-set number of rollers and sizes, some of which you cannot use.  People with long hair can&#x27;t use the smaller rollers, short hair can&#x27;t use the jumbo rollers.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a good system and worth the money.  I would order online because at the local beauty stores the prices are higher.</li>
    <li> Had to send it back.  Couldn’t keep the curlers in my hair. also too few curlers.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed that this product did not work out for me.  I&#x27;ve recently sworn off of styling with heat and was hoping this steam setter was the answer to getting the sort of smooth, soft curls I was used to achieving with the curling iron.  My hair is blond, straight, medium thickness, and a few inches above my bra strap.  It doesn&#x27;t like to hold a tight curl, but has no trouble holding some amount of curl from a curling iron for 48 hours, even without styling products/hairspray.    I tried the Caruso three different times before giving up.  Each time my hair was bone dry.  I tried using really small sections and lots of curlers.  I tried leaving the curlers on the steamer for only 5 seconds before putting them (I also tried longer).  I tried allowing my hair to set for 45 minutes before taking them out.  I tried with and without styling products in my hair.  I tried waiting to finger comb the curls 20 minutes after taking the rollers out.  In all cases, I started out with curls, but they were gone within 15 minutes.  It must be just the nature of my hair, because so many people clearly love this setter and there are many Youtube videos where ladies get way better results than I did.</li>
    <li> A pain. Takes to long. Did not work as well as regular curlers. I tried and tried. Returned it. Egh</li>
    <li> Love these, this is my 3rd set !!</li>
    <li> Hello all.. I am one of those people who look for reviews in ten different websites before buying a product. After reading mixed reviews about this one I decided to take a chance and spend the $$.Also, the curling iron and hot rollers that I tested before this dint give me a great result.I am glad I did.Here is my 2cents. I am from southern part of Asia and have fine,straight,medium to long hair. Mine is prone to a little bit of frizz if not maintained regularly.I first used a curling iron that left my hair with nice curls that lasted for about 4 hrs but fried my hair. Hot rollers gave me good bouncy curl but dint last. But I dint bother to check twice.It did leave a nice shine though.But the thought of hot rollers on my hair dint sound right. To quote Oprah \\&quot;If it doesn&#x27;t sound right,don&#x27;t do it.that lesson and that alone will save you a lot of grief.\\&quot; So I moved on to this one and I will give you my trial wise experience.Keep in mind that mine is one of those high maintenance, hard to curl,fine straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trial 1 : Excited.put the rollers on steamer for 5 secs in steam each and let it sit for 15 mins,fairly simple. I remember the hair being not completely dry when I took the rollers out. Looked  decent at first.Used a bit of hair spray and heat protectant.Had some bouncy waves. Feeling happy, I left home to do some chores and accidentally looked in the mirror in a beauty store.. And to my horror it was the worst look I have ever seen on me. To be precise I looked like a wet dog!! I dint have any frizz that encouraged me to try again.The curls dint last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trial 2: Checked internet for fellow ladies with same experience who finally conquered this.I was sure I dint miss anything before trying  and went for it. 15 mins for rolling. This time I used ionic setting.let it sit for 30 mins.Dint care to roll the hair in a neat fashion since I was travelling.Used hair spray and all that. The result was, a barbie look for first 30 mins. The curls relaxed a bit after that. But ended up with loose waves,slight frizz at the tips which I think is from my hair spray or my careless rolling not tucking the ends.6hrs later I still had loose waves.It did give the wet dog look at the crown,but my lower half of hair still looked decent that led to my third trial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trial 3: Went through pretty much all most helpful reviews in the website and found a fellow curl lover&#x27;s idea for using distilled water. Voila!!! I don&#x27;t remember your name. But I have to say Thank you!!!! I dint use any product. Just put the rollers for 3-5 secs in ionic mode and used about 18 rollers and tucked the ends and rolled in a neat fashion. I should say,practice did make it perfect. Took less than 10mins to roll.left it for 30 mins. ended up with big bouncy curls. It looked awesome. I am writing this review after an hour. Crown has not flattened fully. Curls are loose.would have stayed a lil longer if I had used hair spray.Pretty much big loose waves at this point.Very minimal frizz. Same as trial 2. So my hair spray is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Conclusion: For fine hair,it can still work if you have 40 mins at least.Never wait till the foam is wet.3-5 secs on steamer is just enough. Steaming the cover dint make a big difference.Neither the foam nor the cover should be wet when you put them on hair. wait till it is completely dry before removing the rollers. You will need hair spray to set the look. The curls might not last for 3 days like advertised.Crown lift wont stay for more than 30 mins. you will need something like a moose or root lifting gel for that. Try to roll small sections of hair keeping the ends nicely tucked. Use as many rollers as possible.Make sure you don&#x27;t roll in clumps. For first thirty mins,it will give you the Barbie look and make sure you get home before the clock strikes the 6th hr or you will turn into a pumpkin!!! If you din&#x27;t you ain&#x27;t no Cinderella(that s my jealousy talking!!!. This one is worth a shot.Happy curlingladies!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1month later: Sadly enough,I could not manage to curl my hair the same every single time. I had to be perfect every time even then,curls dint hold some days.Since,its way too time consuming with unpredictable results I am letting this one go. Bought a set of clairol rollers from ebay. Lets see how that works out.</li>
    <li> I only used it twice and it wouldn&#x27;t work anymore... I used drinking water as recommended in other reviews but it has not kept my steamer alive for at least half a year. It was a terrific curler while it lasted. If you find a really cheap one ($5-$10), I suggest buying it...</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this setter! I am African American and I have a relaxer. I try to keep as much heat off of my hair as possible. I bought this Caruso setter after reading the reviews and it did not disappoint! My curls are so soft, shiny, and bouncy. It takes some practice because you have to time it right. For looser curls leave the roller in for maybe 10 minutes and thats it. I will always have one of these in my hair arsenal!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned  Caruso Hairsetters before and didn&#x27;t care for the fact that it had no on-off switch.  When I wore it out Sassoon had an ION steam hairsetter and I purchased it.  Was really happy until it died on me.  When I went to buy another the Sassoon model was no longer available and so I went back to Caruso as they came out with the ION model and purchased it at Amazon.  There are 2 settings and the ION one makes much more steam so I tend to use it more.  Also, I make sure to empty the water container after each use as a precaution to prevent any type of mineral buildup and also use RO water.  My hair is long - below my shoulders - and the set stays in all day and depending upon the size of the rollers you use you can achieve many different styles.  No damage to my hair from heat which is a plus as I color my hair.  I always get many comments on how great my hair looks whenever I use it and, I would have no problem recommending this hairsetter.</li>
    <li> Item arrived in a timely manner and was exactly what I needed!</li>
    <li> This is the biggest waste of money ever! I have naturally straight hair &amp; I recently colored it. I bought these rollers so that I don&#x27;t do more damage to my hair. My hair has never held a curl with these. I have tried steaming the roller for more time &amp; for less time than the booklet says. I also leave them in for a minimum of 45 minutes. Still the curl will not hold for more than 30 min. &amp; the curl that it does give is super weak. Now when I want a little curl in my hair I have to resort to using a curling iron. Such a bummer!</li>
    <li> This product (Caruso Steam Hairsetter) is by far THE BEST alternative to dry heat rollers and curling irons!!!!!!!!!  The steam moisturizers your hair as it curls, leaving your hair curly, smooth and shiny.  Even brittle, dry, damaged hair will benefit from this method of curling.  I have been using this method for 15 years and I highly recommend it!!!  It does take some practice to learn how much steam to allow on the roller for your hair type and the effect you want, but it is well worth the time spent!!!</li>
    <li> This is my third Caruso.  The steam set leaves your curls with an entirely different look.  It&#x27;s also much easier on the hair than the hot rollers I use occassionally.  My favorite feature is that you steam each individual roller before using -- all are freshly steamed when applied.</li>
    <li> This is the only brand my wife uses.  They have a long life span and are a good value for the $$</li>
    <li> Ultimate user didn&#x27;t like it: waaay too many curlers, and you can only heat / steam 1 at a time.</li>
    <li> Too difficult to work with.  I gave this away.  how can you do your entire head?  You can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Love them. Had different set for years - when it broke I panic - could not find brand or anything close. Then I found Caruso brand works same as old brand. Only use steam for my hair, electric dries it out. Only down fall not enough medium rollers. Have to purchase separately.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had them for atleast a month now and I can barely keep my hair straight knowing I have them. For best results watch YouTube tutorials/techniques!</li>
    <li> 4 stars *only* because they don&#x27;t have 2\\&quot; rollers (max is 1.5\\&quot;). The steam heat works great at smoothing out my thick, slightly curly, medium-length hair, but the jumbo size provides too tight a curl for what I want. I&#x27;m not looking for curls - just smooth with some volume. The Caruso steam rollers are brilliant - easy, quick, great results, packable - but I can&#x27;t understand why they don&#x27;t make larger size rollers. Round brush for blow drying, curling iron, regular rollers ... all available in 2\\&quot; sizes.  (Just searched around to see if anyone makes \\&quot;super jumbo\\&quot; hot rollers, but the biggest I can find is 1.75\\&quot;, and they&#x27;re not steam heat. What I did find is a lot of other women complaining that they cannot find 2\\&quot;+ hot rollers.)</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this purchase!  I bought it to use on my daughter specifically for family portraits.  They work great!  Using the different curler/sizes yielded a completely different look.  I had to practice a few times before I got the look I was going for.  They are extremely easy to use.  Note: when using the ionic steam settings, there is a clicking sound.  That&#x27;s normal.  It freaked me out the first time I used it!  Also, on the box it says there are 6 Jumbo and 6 Large curlers.  But, they are the same thing.  So... you get 12 of the jumbo/large size.  No biggy.  I got my money&#x27;s worth.  Glad I got it!</li>
    <li> This is my second Caruso (the old one stopped working on me for unknown reasons after a few years), and I decided to switch to the ION just to see how it works. There&#x27;s a steam only switch and an ION switch, so you can go back and forth between them. Turns out I only ever use the steam only setting, though, because the machine makes a loud, persistent clicking when you set it to ION. Too annoying for me, so I can&#x27;t say how much it makes a difference. Even without, though, I love these rollers! The curls come out gorgeous, without damaging my hair, and they last all day and sometimes even into a second or third day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: GREAT roller system, non-damaging, fast, easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Annoying clicking sound in ION mode, rollers heat up one at a time, can get a weird crimp where the shield attaches to the rollers</li>
    <li> I had an old Caruso set that I found packed away after not using for years because my hair was too short. I pulled it out, put water in it and it still worked!  The foam had disintegrated so I went online to purchase more rollers.  It was almost as cheap to buy the entire hairsetter so I did.  The ion setting is great.  I have very hard to curl hair with quite a bit of gray. Steam is the only way that I can get curl to stay. The curl stayed overnight with only a little touch up from a curling iron the second day.  It was very shiny which is difficult for my hair. I really doubted that the curl would stay with our Texas humidity but it did.  I was very pleased with the body and curl in my hair.  I am looking forward to using it every time I shampoo my hair.  Good by curling irons and straighteners that only curled a little but never held. I am looking forward to experimenting with it.</li>
    <li> I like the fact on this style unit you can place the roller shields on the base for heating, on the other model you have to hold them, you will still have to touch up with a curling iron, as with any hot roller set</li>
    <li> I used to own one of the original systems many years ago and used it until it broke. I really like this system for this price-lots of curlers and the Ion system DOES click-but I am usually listening to music when I do my hair and I don&#x27;t mind.  I love that I don&#x27;t burn my hands with the system-the key for me is to prep my hair before throwing the curler on the steamer-it really doesn&#x27;t take much time to steam up. The curls constantly get compliments :).</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite product! My hair is long and fine. It never holds curl and falls out within hours of curling it even if I use hairspray. This system I do not have to use any product and it hold for a few days. It will loosen a bit but still be pretty. With a curling iron my hair has to be dirty at least a day to curl in the slightest but with this system, I can set it on clean hair. I lot it!!!! I actually ordered a second unit so I would have a lot of curlers and a back up just in case. This product is definitely worth it!!!!!! It does take a couple of attempts to get the technique down so if it doesn&#x27;t look perfect the first time, do not stress! There are a ton of you tube videos with pointers on usage!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this product for me and I am very satisfied. I have been using it for about a month. My hair is very straight, hard to hold curls and is below my shoulders and these rollers give me curls and waves depending on which curlers I use. I am still experimenting.The curls and waves last until I wash my hair again which is usually every other night. I highly recommend this product. The only negative is that I wish it had more medium size curlers. My box came with  5 but you can order more.</li>
    <li> Makes my mornings so much easier. My hair looks great at work and no frizz. Even great to use without the steam. Roll hair when slightly damp and blow dry for a few minutes and done!</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed with this set.  I had the original curlers that salt had to be added to the water and I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the difference but my curls are not that great.  Also expect a snapping noise when using the ion setting.  I actually called customer service to see if the noise was normal and they said it was.  They are easy to use, and dry quickly but still a disapointment.</li>
    <li> my system has a crack in it and the switch gets stuck. When I turn it on ionic it makes this funny noise. I also found a piece of very crimped hair darkish hair in there.... I&#x27;m blonde and I have naturally straight hair so... kinda scary.  They give out to many big ones and not enough small ones. Overall I like it but I wish it was a bit more well made.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts when I was considering whether to buy this roller. It takes practice and experience to know what gives you the best results. I have straight, dyed, medium fine hair. It was a little tricky to use at first, I didn&#x27;t know how long to heat each roller, or how long to leave it in. Different reviews said different things. I was confused...as many of you probably are now..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have learned that the curls stay in my hair longest when I do not oversteam the rollers(I use it on normal setting, not the ionic) First, I put the roller on the steamer, and then I proceed to take a small section of my hair. By the time I have a section of hair ready to be curled onto the roller, the roller is done steaming. I would estimate that to be about 5 seconds. After I remove the roller from the steamer, I put the cap on the steamer for it to steam. And once I am done rolling my hair onto the roller, I take the heated cover, put it onto my rolled hair. This process is pretty quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I leave the roller on the steamer longer than 10 seconds, the rollers might be too wet. You will know if it is too wet when you remove the rollers from your hair and realize that your hair is semi-damp. This way, the curls will not stay. You might try to salvage it by blow drying it. But better to have steamed rollers than wet rollers in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want the curls to remain all day, you will need hair spray. I do not use hair spray because I like the relaxed and wavy curled look. This will depend on how you want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer this steamer so much more than the curling iron. The curling iron is just so damaging. I don&#x27;t believe in using heat protectant either. Hence, this set works well for me, now I can curls whenver I want without thinking about the damage it would do to my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ionic setting DOES give out a loud clicking noise, and it is stated on the manual that the unit will click. However, I use this on the normal steam setting, and it works just as fine. You don&#x27;t necessarily need the ionic setting to achieve the curls you desire. Though I hasten myself to say that I do get annoyed with the clicking noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great steamer set to have if you have some perverse feelings or ideas towards the hot curling iron. I would definitely repurchase this if I had to. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I have my original Caruso Steam Hairsetter that I bought in the 90s and it still works just fine but you have to add salt to it and it&#x27;s a little big. So I decided it was time to update the hairsetter with the newer version. I love this hairsetter! I have very fine, straight, thick hair and this is the only hairsetter that really curls my hair and the curl stays in for longer than a few hours. It is much smaller than the original and takes up a lot less room on my vanity. I accidentally forgot to turn it off once but when the water was below the level it turned itself off. Now I use the ion setting as it makes a clicking noise that reminds me to turn it off. I can&#x27;t really tell a difference between using the ion setting and not using it when curling my hair so I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s there but it keeps me from forgetting to turn it off!  The only drawback to the hairsetter is that you can&#x27;t order extra foam for the curlers; you have to order more curlers; but that was the same way back in the 90s when I bought the original one.</li>
    <li> I have used a caruso curler for at least 25 years.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine thin hair and this is all that works for my hair.  I only hold roller on steamer for count of 5.  Roll hair in thin sections.  Blow dry on cold for 5 minutes hit each roller direct.&lt;br /&gt;Take out curlers. Finger comb to separate and spray well with hairspray!&lt;br /&gt;Lasts all day and I get many compliments!</li>
    <li> Great for shorter hair as they are light weight and don&#x27;t fall off.  Also, they are very conditioning, since they only use steam.  Makes hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this steam roller set. This is my go to when my hair is in an old flat iron to give that style and I look as though I just left the shop. I use the small rollers in the front and the large toward the back, in a flip curl rotation on my medium length hair, then finger comb into bouncy, layered curls that last all day. Glad I purchased!!!!</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick hair that comes to about the middle of my back.  I really liked the concept and product, but after removing the curlers, only the ends of my hair were curled. Each curler only took seconds to heat.  By the time you seperate the section and comb it out, the curler is ready to take off and use.  I think this would be amazing for someone with thinner/shorter hair.</li>
    <li> Great product. Would recommend over and  over and over again. Curls last all day. Carrying case is cheap and smells.</li>
    <li> steam works great, doesn&#x27;t dry her hair out.  The curls last a couple of days, she&#x27;s very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I am really pleased with the quality if curls that I achieved with these rollers and I like the fact that it steam and not harsh heat like from a curling iron</li>
    <li> Had one of these 20 years ago..cried the day it died.  These are great to have.  Good for your hair also.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Well packaged.  Having had this years ago, I was so pleased to see the quality of still a high standard. Thank you</li>
    <li> Either I&#x27;m not using correctly or something is wrong with the product. I&#x27;ve curled my hair with the set three times and let it stay in until dry, but all three times the curls fall out? I&#x27;ve used electric curlers without a problem so not sure how this gets such high reviews.</li>
    <li> Hair! It loves this product so make sure you get it for it. Only give your hair the best of the best.</li>
    <li> I bought his because it stated the voltage was universal, meaning I could use it in the US and in UK.  However, when I received the product and looked at the manual, it stated it was only for use with 120V (US or Japan only).  I didn&#x27;t actually use the curlers and returned them so the 3 stars is arbitrary to the actual function of the product.</li>
    <li> I have used these rollers for many years and love them because they do create a long lasting, natural curl without damaging my hair.  Only one downside, if you have hard water, the mineral build-up will ruin the steamer after about a year.  Since we got a water softener I have had no problems.</li>
    <li> I have used Caruso Steam Hairsetter for years (12).  When my old set finally failed I could not replace it fast enough.  Love these and they are quick and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Not impressed - very difficult to get the hang of it - takes far too long</li>
    <li> I just received my hair steamer today... I am sure I putted water, everything was fine, but when I turned on to Ironic steam, it had the &amp;#34;Bi bi bi&amp;#34; sound non-stop! But when I switched to steam, it doesn&#x27;t has it... Is this condition normal?? Also, there are few cracks on the gray cover when I received it...</li>
    <li> This is so easy to use. The rollers heat up instantly, one at a time, and really do create a setting that holds up. The water method means that my hair does not get dried out from dry heat. This is important to me because I have dry, frizzy hair. My only problem is that I do not need the very large rollers and would have preferred to have more of the mid and small sized ones.</li>
    <li> cgotta first one in 80&#x27;s loved it still works. I gave it to my daughter and bought this one. old had hairsetting spray product which held curl longer wish it was still available.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It steams quickly and is small enough to travel with. Each roller takes just a couple of minutes and I can curl my whole head in about 15 minutes. It&#x27;s perfect for a quick \\&quot;too busy to wash my hair\\&quot; do.</li>
    <li> I first saw this used in a video on YouTube (Wendy&#x27;s Look Book) and thought about it for a while, after much research I decided to purchase this item since I&#x27;m looking for a healthier way to curl my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is super straight (being Asian), and doesn&#x27;t even hold curls at times.  The key thing that worked for me was to not leave the roller on the steamer for too long.  Less than 8 seconds works best for my hair.  When I first got it, I let the roller steam for too long and when I took the roller out of my hair it was damp and didn&#x27;t curl, obviously because I basically let the roller get soaked up in water from steaming for too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I learned to let the roller steam for the &#x27;right&#x27; amount of time, the curls came out NICE, SHINY, and HEALTHY-LOOKING, I fell in LOVE with this product!  My curls held up all day.  My favorite part about this product is that because its only steam, it can be used daily, as opposed to flat irons.  I&#x27;m very glad I discovered this product.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
    <li> Great curl and I don&#x27;t have to wait until the whole set heats up, just heat each one I need for a few seconds.  Really easy to use.</li>
    <li> Rollers won&#x27;t stay in place. - I just hate them and would not recommend this set to  anyone.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Tried many times to use this setter and followed directions.  The way these rollers are used with the cover clips they tend to flop and that leaves a type of groove in naturally curly hair.  The way the steam works is also not ease to use.  The unit and the curlers sit on a shelf and will never be used..</li>
    <li> The Caruso C97958 ION Steam Hairsetter is as easy as it shows on YouTube.  Whether you want a quick pick up for an interview or a nice curly look for a night out, the ION Steam Hairsetter will do the job.  I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> It is really good, it made easy my wife life..It is really good and very helpfull.Just if you as me from Croatia( Europa) you will have to buy trasormator for eletricity because it is not working on 220 v</li>
    <li> I have used the Caruso hairsetters for years.  I tried using the curling irons but they just dried out my hair, so when I realized what damage was being done with the curling iron I bought me another Caruso.  Great for my granddaughters fine hair too!</li>
    <li> There is nothing like getting something in the mail only to open it and find out that it does not work. I filled the water to the line plugged it in, only to hear a loud ticking sound for 30 minutes, no steam at all!!!! Amazon needs to check the merchant that is. Fulfilling the orders, this item was a defect !! So irritating .</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it said it can be used worldwide.  The instructions leaflet says to use 110 voltage only.  Now I cannot use it in countries with 220 voltage that I travel to.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hair setter! It was recommended to me by someone who did my hair while on a show for the Style network. I went on Amazon and bought it the next day! I received it two days later. I used it that night and fell in love. It is so quick, the curls lasts until you wash them out without the need of hair spray. I curled my hair on monday with them in about 15 minutes. The next day Tuesday woke up with still perfect curls, weds morning, I STILL had the curls but I had to wash my hair by then but I could have gone another day and still looked like I had a perfectly styled head of hair. This is one of the best hair products I own aside from my flat iron! I officially in love and the ION setting leave the hair smooth, softer and shinier than the regular steam. yes, it does make a loud ticking noise but its not loud enough to wake anyone up. I use it in the morning while my family is still asleep in the house and no one can hear me.</li>
    <li> These are ok, but they take a long time to actually dry. I&#x27;m not as impressed with the length of time that the curl lasts either. Foam curlers seem to work better for me.</li>
    <li> These are the BEST steam rollers I have ever used! But I think any steam rollers would do great.  I have been using it for over 15 years.  The key to keeping the full, bouncy curls when it&#x27;s humid is using a thermal styling spray before rolling up your hair on it.  I like Redken&#x27;s 22 Hot sets and Kenra&#x27;s Thermal styling spray 19 or 20. ( I think 20 smells better.)  You can get those anywhere now, even at Walmart or Amazon.  I have long fine hair.  To cut down on my time, I dry my hair completely using a great brush, and spray my hair lightly with setting spray, pulling my hair up and such to get different layers. Then I shoot it with the dryer and comb out.  Remember, I said lightly.  Then, i pull my hair up in a pony tail (you will have to experiment height and placement on your own) and I use two jumbo rollers.  Splitting my pony tail in half, I comb through one half, spray lightly on both sides, comb through to keep from the hair matting once rolled, and I let the steam go in roller for about 10 seconds since my hair is long(past my shoulders by 2 inches maybe more)  Your hair has to get hot then cool off to set.  This is what a beautician told me.  I roll my long bangs but I do not put a cover over it,  I lean over and steam the bangs in the roller then let cool for a few seconds, blast with heat, then with cool setting and unroll like a ringlet. Once I roll my pony tail, I let set for a few minutes while putting on my make up.  I also steam the inside of cover before I put it on the roller I have my hair rolled up on.  I have rolled my hair this way for 25 years before I started steam rollers.  I have not set the rollers all over my head because with 3 boys and work, I don&#x27;t have time but the last time I did it turned out with tighter curls.  Thermal setting spray is key and mousse sometimes is great for more body.  I have experimented with different sizes of rollers for different sized curls.  It&#x27;s your preference and it may take a few times to get the look you want...everyone&#x27;s hair is DIFFERENT, but after being in 7 weddings in one year, in Austin, Texas, during the lovely humid and hot summer months, THERMAL SETTING SPRAY and Anti-humidity hair spray are your BEST FRIENDS!u want...everyone&#x27;s hair is DIFFERENT, but after being in 7 weddings in one year, in Austin, Texas, during the lovely humid and hot summer months, THERMAL SETTING SPRAY and Anti-humidity hair spray are your BEST FRIENDS!</li>
    <li> Was really looking forward to this hair roller set. It is much harder to use. Takes longer to set. Curls did not last longer. Very disappointed. I&#x27;m going right back to my jumbo revlon heated rollers.</li>
    <li> I have had 2 Caruso hair setters in the past.  They were the kind that use salt.  I don&#x27;t know if that is the difference, but the new one doesn&#x27;t seem to make my curls last as long as the original kind.&lt;br /&gt;  I do like the small compact size, the speed at which it begins steaming and the large selection of rollers that are included with this purchase.  I am just hoping as I work with my new unit, I can figure out a way to make my curls last..  If I get that figured out, I will definitely upgrade my rating to 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I ordered this set in November as my &amp;#34;backup&amp;#34; set, since I have been using these for years and I don&#x27;t want to be without one if my other one happens to go out.  Today I decided to open the package and test it out to make sure all was working well....and not wait until I actually &amp;#34;needed&amp;#34; it.  As usual, the product works like a charm.  I love the ION Stem.  This is the first one I&#x27;ve had that comes in black and grey.  It seems to be a little bit lighter in weight, but still works just great!  So, I am putting it away now that I know it works great and will be all set whenever I need it.  The one I am using now is the red and white one and it has lasted a number of years.  Thanks for a great product.  I can&#x27;t live without it, so please keep them stocked up.  Thanks again.&lt;br /&gt;Happy in Federal Way, WA.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!!!!! The only hair curling system that won&#x27;t damage my hair and curls my whole hair in less than 5 minutes!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have had a set of Caruso rollers in the past and these are not the same. My other set was great. My hair would stay curled for 2 days. These make your hair damp so no curl will hold.</li>
    <li> People ask me what kind of hair curling tool  i am using all the time, because my hair looks so natural and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for almost 20 years now.. I bought my 2nd one from Amazon, and I&#x27;m loving it!!!</li>
    <li> I just bought this and love it!!  However, it makes a hissing noise when I turn on the steamer.  Is it suppose to? Or do I have a defected one?  Please let me know!</li>
    <li> Good hair curling system I have ever used, no damage for the hair, it can be used all type of hair</li>
    <li> I really do like this. i bought it for my sister and i take it all the time. my sister has issues with curling her hair. shes always asking me to do it. but with this she has perfect curls and it isnt as damaging on her already dyed hair. it really does take some time to get used to using this. there are tons of videos on youtube demonstrating how to use this. i learned quickly from Wendyslookbook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!</li>
    <li> I owned the original back in the &#x27;80s and loved it.  I just purchased this new model with the promise of 5 different sizes of rollers, 6 each, for a total of 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived.  With 30 rollers.  As follows:  TWELVE Jumbo/Large (in the ad, they state that Jumbo and Large are two different sizes; they are not.  Roller is clearly marked \\&quot;Jumbo/Large\\&quot;.  There are 6 each of medium, small and petite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am furious at having been duped.  What&#x27;s further enraging is that the enclosed roller re-order form actually lists \\&quot;jumbo\\&quot; and \\&quot;large\\&quot; with two different SKUs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is preposterous and deceptive.  Amazon should correct it right away.</li>
    <li> Hairsetter works great,. It is easy to use and and makes my hair look shiny. The curl lasts until my hair is washed.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter was very pleased with this.  Just what she wanted.</li>
    <li> The bomb , they work really well!!</li>
    <li> I had a set of steam curlers from maybe 15 years ago. I only use them occasionally. My new haircut renewed my interest in them. Sadly time had taken its toll and the foam was disintegrating. As I shopped for replacement curlers, I also found this unit. For the price of the curlers, it is like getting the steam unit free. This one has an ionizer feature which I honestly can&#x27;t see any difference in whether it is on or off. But it has a great selection of curlers and a handy storage bag. You really can&#x27;t go wrong trying it out. It is kind to your hair and easy to use. It heats up in less than a minute.</li>
    <li> I have a bob and my experience with this product was not at all like the video with the model curling her own hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent price and fast shipping! I am going to try not using tap water with this unit. My last unit only lasted 5 years and only used the set 2 x a month.</li>
    <li> Tried it three times and my hair went flat within an hour . Maybe not meant for my type of hair</li>
    <li> I had the original purple unit for many years until I finally killed it.  I love this new unit!  It&#x27;s small enough to take on trips, and works fantastic!  Even my 3 year old likes to help me with the curlers.  It&#x27;s very cool!</li>
    <li> This is my third caruso steam hairsetter.  I love them.  It is so quick and easy. Last minute plans--no problem curl your hair and ready to go in a few minutes.</li>
    <li> Great hair rollers. Took me several times experimenting with the size of the rollers and their placement on the head. I was used to putting larger ones on top and using smaller ones going down on the scalp. After reading another review I found what works best for the style I wanted was smaller on top and larger on the bottom. Very happy with these rollers!</li>
    <li> People rave about this product.  However I followed all the instructions and found it takes 5 minutes for each roller to heat up.  That&#x27;s nearly an hour if you use just 12 of the 30 rollers!  Then an additional 15 minutes to let it all dry.  The curls did not last even a few hours on my hair.</li>
    <li> Remember the paradigm shift you had to make when you first got your microwave? &lt;br /&gt;If you tried to cook like you did on the stove or oven the results were disastrous! &lt;br /&gt;Well, the same is true with the Caruso and conventional hot curlers. &lt;br /&gt;1.  The C. does not heat up, it holds a small amount of steam that takes no more than 30 seconds to fill the chamber. &lt;br /&gt;2.  If the sponge gets wet, you have waited too long and have to wait for it dry out. &lt;br /&gt;3.  The curlers are dry when you crank those locks and your hair never gets wet. &lt;br /&gt;4.  Your curl should be set after just a couple of minutes so if you run out of curlers by the time to get the nape of the neck, &lt;br /&gt;      remove the ones you first set and reuse them. &lt;br /&gt;5.  The unit itself does not heat up exactly, as soon as you have steam you are ready to go - mine take about 2-3 minutes.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This is my fifth Caruso hairsetter.  I love the appliance.  Nothing else give me such lasting volume and waves, so quickly or easily.  I have long, very thick hair, and using a curling iron to get the same effect takes over 40 minutes.  With the Caruso, I&#x27;m set to go in less than 15 minutes, start to finish.  Even though the anchoring post for steaming the rollers was broken upon arrival, I kept this shipment, becuase I can&#x27;t stand to be without this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little tricky at first, but once you get the hang of getting your hair around the rollers it works great!</li>
    <li> I have used the Caruso hairsetter since the salt days as well, probably at least 15 years.  I have long very heavy hair, the set lasts me three days! It does loosen a little as the days go by.  The curlers take some getting used to but once you get the hang of it you&#x27;ll never want to use anything else. I go to the hairdresser once a month and she agree&#x27;s with me that I get a better set and it looks nicer with the Caruso curlers then with anything she has.  In fact when I go to get my hair cut and colored I take my Caruso with me and set my own hair while there because I&#x27;ve been doing it for so long I can set it in about 7 minutes which is way faster then she can it. She has two other clients that do the same thing.  If you are having trouble getting used to setting your hair with this appliance just keep plugging away at it I promise it will get better as you get used to it and you don&#x27;t have to worry about the heat drying your hair after coloring or perming.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this set!</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Caruso system over the last 15 years.  I love that this one has an on/off button.  The curl/wave (depending on the size roller) you get lasts for days.  I leave them in for about 15 minutes, then remove the rollers and use my hairdryer, on low, to dry any remaining dampness.  My hair is soft and shiny each time I use them. Nothing else on the marketplace compares.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and bought this based on the fact that I had used the old clairol steam roller system and remember the great curl and condition of my hair.  For years I have used a curling iron and it is doing it&#x27;s damage unless I cut my hair quite short.  I got the big system yesterday and used it this morning. Not difficult to handle, but the curl, despite long times in the hair, was totally inadequate.  I had to go over each one with the curling Iron.  I now have one more big item I won&#x27;t use.  It came with three additional boxes of rollers too. Sad, for me.</li>
    <li> This is the 4th set I have owned and like this one the best. It seems to be more efficient and I like the ionic steam option. Concerned at first about the clicking noise it made with the ionic option but then realized that it&#x27;s suppose to make that sound.</li>
    <li> Although I quite like this set because of the &amp;#34;steaming&amp;#34; effects my hair doesn&#x27;t hold the curl as well as my &amp;#34;heated&amp;#34; curlers. The steam heats up in seconds and the clips hold the curlers in place very well. When I first take the curlers out the curls are awesome but then they fall out in a short while. I don&#x27;t like to use hairspray but perhaps if I used this then it would warrant spraying to keep the curlers in place. The set comes with a whole bunch of curlers and I think it would be a good set to take on vacations since it&#x27;s so small. I would recommend it but to use hairspray after the hair is curled.</li>
    <li> After reading many review on the Caruso C97958 Ion Steam Hairsetter and many other brands I thought this product was going to be great. Frankly it&#x27;s just ok. The end result set is ok but here is what I did not like:&lt;br /&gt;1 The roller shields do not hold the rollers securly in place and I had to buy butterfly clips to get the job done. 2 The roller shields didn&#x27;t let my hair dry fully from the steam, even after 45 minutes. 3 The machine makes an anoying clicking sound on the ION STEAM setting, this is normal by the way. 4 My hair didn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; the products states. I&#x27;ve gotten better results from traditonal hot roller. 5 The package listing says 6 Jumbo and 6 Large but the Jumbo and Large rollers and one and the same. I bought a seperate pack of Large rollers thinking I would need that size and didn&#x27;t need them. Would not replace this system when it breaks.</li>
    <li> I had Caruso Curl system when it first appeared baaaack in the 1990&#x27;s when you had to use salt to get it going.  I threw the rollers out couple months ago because the foam was falling apart and never knew where to find replacements.  Then I was searching rollers... and BOOM!  I was soo excited I used them as soon as them came in!  The new and improved is AWESOME!!!  Used them on my daughters hair this morning for picture day!  Her hair NEVER holds curl!  It did today!</li>
    <li> Love them. This is my third set in the past 25 years.</li>
    <li> I used the Caruso in the 90s and finally replaced it with this model. Works perfectly for me. I love it and prefer to wet sets or traditional hot rollers.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews I had to go out and buy one, and I am so glad I did! I had bought a large curling iron before I bought the steam curlers, and it took about 40 min. to curl my hair (my hair is very thick, long, and has some damage to it, so it&#x27;s a little coarse), even after I curled my hair with the iron, I had to go back over it because I soon as I was finished, the first side I curled was already going flat. Later on that afternoon, my hair was completely flat. I took the iron back. The I read the reviews on here and went and bought one. It works wonders!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all the Caruso steamer starts steaming right away, so no waiting for it to heat up, second it took me about 15 min. the first time to curl all my hair, third my hair was very curly and most importantly it held all day! Even the next day my hair had curl. The girl who said hers did not curl at all must not have read the instructions, because a curling iron wouldn&#x27;t even curl my hair, and I know how tough it is for my hair to curl, and this product did it wonderfully! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I had the old Caruso hairsetter years ago and ended up throwing it away when I couldn&#x27;t find any replacement foam for the curlers.  I was so happy to run into the product again.  I have very baby fine hair...and since I used it years ago...it&#x27;s a little thinner these days.  Anyway, I never feel like I&#x27;m burning it as with curling irons or ruining the hair with perms.  The curls hold all day whether I want small tight curls or larger ones.</li>
    <li> I used to have a Caruso, but it was huge.  This one is much smaller and takes up very little space.  It heats quickly and is very easy to use.  It works so well that I use only the large rollers.  I haven&#x27;t even tried any of the smaller sizes because I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;d look like Shirley Temple!  My curls last all day even in the hot humid weather we experience in Austin, Texas.  This time around I use only distilled water (using Texas tap water messed up my old unit).  I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love the Caruso Steam Hairsetter, you can&#x27;t get curls like these with electric rollers, believe me I have tried every electric roller out there. I had the first Caruso when it came out and it lasted for years, thank God they have a newer version, I would be lost with it!&lt;br /&gt;This is an awesome product!</li>
    <li> A very quick way to curl your hair. I always have had trouble doing my hair and this really works!  It&#x27;s got several different sizes of rollers, so you can choose whether you want tight curls or just wavy. I LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> I love using the Caruso Steam Hairsetter. It gives me long lasting curls that stay even in the hot warehouse environment I work in.</li>
    <li> I think this is a wonderful product! I got it to replace my old o e, and it has improved a lot over the years! PAM</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use the two bigger rollers because my hair is too short. It would be nice if you would sell one with all smaller rollers.</li>
    <li> This might work for some, but not my hair. I have thick hair that holds onto moisture (shoulder length that takes 1 hour to blow dry) and the rollers left my locks a complete mess. No curls, no shine-just a frizzy mess. I experimented with the amount of time I left the rollers on the steamer, but nothing worked for me. I was hoping that these would work because I am concerned about heat and damage, but returned these and bought the BaByliss Professional 30 Nano Titanium Hairsetter Roller Set.</li>
    <li> CARUSO STEAM ROLLER HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME. I HAD A SET 20 YEARS AGO, AND THEY WORK NOW JUST LIKE THEY DID 20 YRS AGO.</li>
    <li> The box says that (in addition to the petite/small/medium rollers-that I will never use) that it includes 6 Large Rollers and 6 Jumbo Rollers. But in my set there were 12 Jumbo Large rollers. Which are too big for my hair and the Medium are too small. I need the in between size that was promised on the box. Sigh. Other than that I love my set. It&#x27;s just the the jumbo size makes my hair wavy and I am not sure it holds as long as I want it to.</li>
    <li> This product has a lot of reviews and many of them are positive. I decided to give this product a shot. I&#x27;ve only used it once so far and haven&#x27;t quite gotten the hang of it yet. (Though I tried to make sure not to steam the rollers to long to avoid them being &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; when I put them in my hair, I still think they were too damp or I didn&#x27;t leave them in long enough.) I will keep experimenting to see if I can improve here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from what is most likely user error, the other downside to this product is that the ion setting makes the unit click the entire time it is operating. I did some research online to see if this was normal/expected and it looks like it is. The regular steam setting does not make the clicking noise. The noise is not enough of a deal-breaker for me to return so long after purchasing (I waited a few months before trying it out), but a little frustrating because I wake up to get ready for work before my husband and can&#x27;t use this product then or it would wake him up.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Sometimes I can get away with a second day of curls from just one set. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about these curlers because my friend was getting married and she wanted curly hair, but her hair is really long and doesn&#x27;t hold curls well. It took FOREVER for us to figure out how to use them, and even when we did we weren&#x27;t sure if we were doing it right. The curls didn&#x27;t stay in for any time at all. I&#x27;ll still experiment with them, but I haven&#x27;t been wowed yet.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Caruso steam hairsetter for years, and needed a new one as I finally blew up my old one. It is the ONLY way that my straight hair will retain a curl. I love it!</li>
    <li> but the curls don&#x27;t stay in. I chose to forgo the covers that come with set and use roller clips instead. Whether that has anything to do with the results, I don&#x27;t know ...... but the curls only last a few minutes no matter how long I leave the curlers in.</li>
    <li> Received this item today. Excited to open, disappointed to see. First of all, it came in colourcof grey instead of red.&lt;br /&gt;Most important is There are several crack markes on unit. I can tell right away that this product is made from very cheap material, plastic and foam. With cracks and obvious low quality material, i dont see it will last. I bought this based on good reviews here, which means i was misled. Will try to return it.[[ASIN:B0002JKPA4 Caruso C97958 Professional ION Steam Hairsetter]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, very good customer service though, had a smooth return.</li>
    <li> I tried three times to get this to work (and watched a you tube tutorial) and maybe it&#x27;s just my hair because everyone else seems to love it, but it wouldn&#x27;t hold the curl at all...even with product the curls, more like waves really, just fell after a few minutes....resulting in just a mess of hair. My hair is naturally wavy and not especially course, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this, but maybe it&#x27;s just me....hair is a subjective thing I suppose.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the days I don&#x27;t wash my hair.  Soft curls and easy to style</li>
    <li> I love this curler.  I have fine thin hair and it curles my hair with curls that hold up.  It is quick to heat up and small enough to sit on my makeup table.</li>
    <li> I have medium long fine hair, just below the shoulders.  The clips are not strong enough to hold the roller close to the scalp.  They do roll out half way, especially on the sides next to your ears.  Then you need to leave them on for 30min until the hair is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s annoying that you have to place 1roller on at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are ok.  I have used the hot roller which I think are better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They can be used to straight your hair if the hair is dry. The steam made it easier to straighten my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy, the curls are lovely, but they do fall out during the day and after a couple weeks of use I started losing hair.  I have fine hair.  I had a lot of long fine hair.  Now I have medium length, except in the back where it just broke off a couple inches from the crown.  People ask if I got my hair cut.</li>
    <li> It was and is fine. I have been using Caruso for years but couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores after I moved.</li>
    <li> I saw this product reviewed on YouTube so I had to get it. It gives me amazing curls in 15 min!!! Love this!</li>
    <li> Love this item. I use this everyday or when needed to curl my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would order this item again or give it out as a gift. loved it.</li>
    <li> No problems at all, and have been using for 6 months. The travel bag is too heavy, and noxious smelling - an environmental waste.</li>
    <li> This is a better hair steamer without the need to use salt like the old one. I would rather use this instead of a hot iron that damages your hair.  This helps to curl your hair and does not damage it like the hot iron.  Depending on the type of hair you have, and the amount of hair you use for the curler, your curls can last the entire day.  If your hair is soft and thick, the curl may not stay all day.</li>
    <li> Love Love these rollers!  Best curlers there is!  We have used them for atleast 10 years.  My girls used them in high school and still using them today.  Just used them for my youngest wedding.  She was beautiful!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work and none in stock foa an exchange.  Used this in the 90&#x27;s and it was great for my heavy relaxed hair.  I will probably order another when the stock comes in.</li>
    <li> I love Caruso Hairsetter. It works great, and the curls are wonderful. I use mine daily. Your going to love this item.</li>
    <li> Good product. Good everything. Will recommend for other people. We are very happy with it. Have a very nice day.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, but I honestly find that the covers are not the most convenient I&#x27;ve used on a roller system. Still worth it for the price and the steam is not damaging, gives a nice curl, and leaved my hair so soft.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of a fashion blog (Wendy Nguyen). She recommended it and made a video of her using them, making them look super easy and convenient. I didn&#x27;t find it to be either of those things. First of all, Wendy has super thin hair vs my thick hair. I don&#x27;t know how much of a factor that is but the curls were frizzy, messy, and unattractive. I&#x27;ve used twice &amp; haven&#x27;t opened it since. It was 40$ down the drain when curls made by my 15$ curling iron &amp; 15$ hair curlers did a way better job.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my wife, after she had purchased one and only worked once.&lt;br /&gt;The unit I purchased also did not work as promised. Based on reviews and videos from other \\&quot;users\\&quot;, it looked to be an impressive unit, however, after the first use on both units, the devices barely distributed any steam for the process. Instructions were followed precisely. But to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;My opinion is for people to not waste their money.</li>
    <li> I bought these once before and was sad when the unit stopped working. I am happy to have them again because every time I use them everyone compliments my great curls. The steam works great to keep curl all day, even in my fine hair. A great product that doesn&#x27;t kill your hair with heat to to get those perfect beach waves!</li>
    <li> This product did not work well to curl my hair. I found it easy to use, but not effective. The curls just never took. It lost heat very quickly once removed from the steamer. It was shipped quickly and packaged well, but over all I ended up trying it several times and gave up. It just doesn&#x27;t work for me. I gave it away.</li>
    <li> I love this Caruso steam setter! Read the reviews before I made the purchase. Just what I was looking for. Worth the investment😀</li>
    <li> I use to use hot rollers many years ago. I was looking for  something that would hold the curl more than a few hours. I can&#x27;t use curling irons as they get too hot so I use hot curling brushes. I really enjoy the Caruso. It only takes 10-12 curlers and I am done. It does take awhile to get use to heating the curlers and putting on the clips. Be sure to read the reviews for good tips. Once my hair got frizzy but one reviewer said it was from too much steam and she was correct. Next time I steamed the curlers for 4-6 seconds only. Anyway enjoy.</li>
    <li> May need to work with cutlers more.  Ends of hair are sometimes frizzy.  Haven&#x27;t given up on it yet.  Will continue use.</li>
    <li> These curlers are the best!!!!  My hair  feels incredible soft and the curls last all day long  It&#x27;s a great product !!!!!  And  thanks for the fast shipping</li>
    <li> I and my hair miss the humidity of the Carolinas. The Caruso steam setter has helped prevent further damage to my dry hair (thanks to the SoCal weather). The curls last all day and my hair looks incredible!</li>
    <li> Gives you great curls and soft hair since it has the ionic feature.  The curls really last compared to other hot rollers.  I don&#x27;t use any other hot roller set.</li>
    <li> Really love this roller kit!  First of all, I have very straight, thin, curl resistant hair.  I found that there was only one curling iron which could hold my curls for more than an hour and that is the Hot Tools tourmaline.  I hate slaving over the mirror with a curling iron holding one curl at a time and have often fantasized about using a roller set but worried that the curls wouldn&#x27;t hold.  I tried the Caruso Ion Hairsetter today and it was great!  It&#x27;s been several hours and my curls are still there, I was able to roll the curls and go about my business rather than holding the damn curling iron forever.  I like that the kit comes with three sizes of curls along with a manual on how to create different styles!  This is so much nicer than a curling iron, so much versatility in what you can create and it takes almost no waiting for the unit to start or to fill the rollers with steam.  This has to be one of the best inventions ever!  It was also easy to clean, just dump out the water and put the rollers away.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I used this product years ago when it costs over 100$;great to have found it again for such a great price!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s incredible, it really is. I have thin, fine and stick straight hair. I put these puppies in for 30 minutes (while I&#x27;m getting ready) and BAM I have a full head of curls or waves depending on how tightly I rolled them and whether I used the small or large rollers. The best part is that I don&#x27;t put a single product on my hair to set them yet my hair STILL has incredible body and bounce two days later. It isn&#x27;t curly two days later, no, but it is wavy and full like I have twice the hair I actually have. These are a keeper.</li>
    <li> I have short hair so have only used the small and petite rollers just for some extra body.  The water heats up fast and so do the rollers.  The best part is the soft feel of your hair from the steam heat and no damage as might be the case from a curling iron or regular electric rollers.  Great set.</li>
    <li> This hair setter is not a good product the lid will not stay on it and this is a burn hazard for someone.When you curl the hair it is though nothing has happened at all.</li>
    <li> I love this hair-setter. I am one to buy all kinds of hair gadgets and even bought this Caruso set when it FIRST came out many years ago requiring the salt added to water. So I really appreciated this one not needing salt anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love how the curls set and last all day (even with high humidity!) Trick I&#x27;ve learned to use is &#x27;distilled&#x27; water for better curls and and also helps keep the hair-setter lasting longer (hard water will make curls harder to stay in) and I use a blow dryer to help set the curls faster. (I seem to always be in a hurry, lol) and how no matter how much I use it, NO damage to my hair! Curls are soft, shiny and bouncy! Another trick to keep in mind, the tighter you wrap the curl within the foam of the roller, the tighter the curl.&lt;br /&gt;I also really appreciate how easy it is to carry with me on a trip, just throw everything into the carry bag. (minus the water)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as advertised.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> I had to return it. It did not steam. It had obviously been used before. The return was easy and my money refunded.</li>
    <li> This set is very poor quality and not functional. I would expect to find this set in a gas station for sale. Do not buy!</li>
    <li> Beware that when turning the unit on the \\&quot;Ionic\\&quot; setting it does make a loud clicking noise that does not go away unless you turn to \\&quot;Steam\\&quot; only setting or \\&quot;Off\\&quot;. It is a annoying. As far as the curling abilities, I used it once and the curls were  mediocre after leaving the rollers on for 20 minutes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Caruso curlers since the early 90s and I&#x27;ll never use any other. I&#x27;m only on my second set, so they last a long time. I have long,thick,frizzy hair and these curlers work great on my hair. Tip: after you heat up a curler,shake it off before you put it in your hair. Some hot water can settle on the plastic part of the curler and drip on your skin and burn you.</li>
    <li> I have very fine straight soft hair.  I have damaged my hair using curling irons and hot rollers for years.  These rollers seem to roll my hair and it stays without the damage of a curling iron.  I think you have to get used to your own way of using these curlers. After some practice I learned that they are pretty easy to use and take about the same amount of time as if I used a curling iron.  Once they are in my hair I spray lightly with hair spray and 10 minutes later I have curls.  Because my hair is very slick and straight the snap on covers that come with the rollers left marks in my hair. So I tried using regular hair clips (longer version).  The curlers have slots on the sides so that a hair clip can slip right in.  No marks.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that would be easy to do in the mornings after nights when I&#x27;m too tired to prep my hair for styling the next day without a lot of heat.... I did a lot of research and decided to take a chance on this set after seeing so many stellar reviews. I was not disappointed at all! They are so versatile! I can do a quick bump of my ends with a few of the jumbo rollers in the mornings, or a regular roller set or roller wrap for more body... I&#x27;ve even given a chunky braidout a boost, by braiding at night and setting the ends of the braids with these in the morning, during the end of a particularly long and high maintenance stretch between relaxers.  And the heat is NOT damaging!! My hair actually feels MORE moisturized after I use these, EVERY TIME.  The results are so great my sister and mom have even started using my steam hairsetter.  The great part about it is that so many rollers of different sizes were in the set, and we all have different hair lengths, making it easy for all of us to have rollers in our hair at the same time if we need to.  And to those with african american hair that have complained of frizziness, I have found that lightly using a little coconut oil with my olive oil setting foam and end papers works wonders for preventing the frizz.  Also, I&#x27;ve found that different steam times for each size roller are much more effective, i.e. shorter steaming time (5 or 6 seconds) for small or petite rollers while longer (like 9 to 11 seconds) for jumbo rollers.  If you allow the roller to become soaked the drying process will become much longer, and you increase the risk for frizz.  If you&#x27;re looking for something that&#x27;s quick and don&#x27;t mind a styling method that will actually condition your hair at the same time, I think this steamer is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I VERY RARELY review anything... ever...but I felt the world should know about this since, apparently, I was super late :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have fun with your steam hairsetters guys!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Thus far I&#x27;ve only used the the ionic feature. This feature produced way more steam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 4a4b natural coily hair. Of course I straighten my hair first. These rollers worked magic!!! Loooooove. I will definitely use again.</li>
    <li> The website states &amp;#34;The only patented steam hair setting sytem with worldwide dual voltage.&amp;#34; But this is not the case!  The device and the manual both clearly say 120V only...meaning folks in Asia, Australia and Europe cannot use this product without a current converter (not just an adapter plug).  Additionally, the plug is a polarised plug, meaning that one end is fatter than the other (not just a standard US plug) and may not work with your normal travel adapters....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying a current converter is not necessarily cheap, especially if you are ordering online as these things are heavy and shipping will be expensive.  This is a consideration to bear in mind if you are hell-bent on using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product looks fine and has a great reputation from users, but it&#x27;s a shame that I can&#x27;t tell you personally how good it is because of the website&#x27;s blatant misrepresentation.  Ebay sellers may also have copied the description and will be subject to the same misrep problem...someone should really fix the description!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved Caruso setters for many years now. This ION one is ready instantly and continues to do a great job. Much better for my hair than a dry heat!</li>
