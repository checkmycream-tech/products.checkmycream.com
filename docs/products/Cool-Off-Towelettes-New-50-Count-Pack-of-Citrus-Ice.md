    <li> I carried these along as I traveled to New York City and to South India.  Tingly and refreshing break from the heat and humidity.</li>
    <li> I love these! I use them all the time and highly recommend them to anyone who needs a quick coll off.</li>
    <li> I just received this and it has a strong cent , It has a burning a sensation to my neck don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> Living in South Texas, this product is a very important part of my day.  Also, at my age I often wake up very hot at night so keep one by my bedside.  I&#x27;ve recommended this product to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I like that these are conveniently packed... they don&#x27;t necessarily cool you off, but they do that cold burn that menthol or the fake aloe vera gels do.. I believe all from the same ingredients. So, I don&#x27;t feel like it cools me off but it does feel good for a few minutes &amp; it is convenient. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again, but I accidentally bought 2 cases and I plan on using them. I will note, when I read reviews there was one or two complaints about the smell... I did not have a problem with the smell. It was lemon-y, but not very strong and didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> These little wipes cooled me off when I had a hot flash on the Island of Capri In stifling heat.  A friend had them along and kindly shared.  Needless to say, I ordered them as soon as I got home!  Keep them in your purse, tear one open and wipe your neck, inside wrists and elbows. The cooling lasts a long time - a great relief!</li>
    <li> Have gone through 2 boxes of these.  (Save your box and refill with these loose ones as they come in a zip lock bag).  I sweat profusely and carry these in my purse.  To preserve make-up just pat your face with them.  If make-up not an issue, wipe over face and neck.  Keep away from eyes.  Has a citrusy smell but dissipates quickly.</li>
    <li> The bomb.com. I am a hot box and i love these things. Left my skin feeling cool and clean. I don&#x27;t leave home without them.</li>
    <li> Included these in wedding welcome bags and in bathroom baskets for summer wedding to help keep people cool. They work really well, and the smell is nice (refreshing and not at all overwhelming)</li>
    <li> Reordered this over last couple of years.  Really works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a menopausal nurse and don&#x27;t know how I made it before I found these towelettes to keep in my pocket at work. They are awesome!</li>
    <li> the cooling is actually a vaporub and it gives some burning sensation</li>
    <li> Invigorating feeling of coolness. I keep these towelettes in lots of areas for quick cool relief.</li>
    <li> very good product works well in hot humid weather.great for hot flashes too.</li>
    <li> These wipes stay neatly in the packet in your pocket until you need them.  One sdwipe on the back of the neck, or up and down the arms,and you feel immediately more comfortable.</li>
    <li> I love these towelettes and use them all summer.  Great to carry with you wherever you go and always share with others.</li>
    <li> I always order these when going on vacation to a tropical destination. They are great to keep in my beach bag or purse. They really do cool you off for a short period of time... Wish the cooling sensatoin lasted a little longer but for the comfort and money... I&#x27;ll take them!</li>
    <li> I went on Safari to Africa, and these little towelettes really gave me the COOL down I needed from time to time.  They smell good and keep you cool for quite a while.</li>
    <li> A must have for the summer. Actually cools your skin to the touch and last for over an hour. Carry in my purse for days I did not expect to be out in heat much.</li>
    <li> Very good for hot flashes</li>
