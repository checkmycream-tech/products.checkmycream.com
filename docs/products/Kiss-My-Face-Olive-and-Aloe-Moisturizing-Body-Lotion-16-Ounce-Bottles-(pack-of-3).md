      <li>You will love it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s free, but why make something free if it lacks the moisturizing factor?</li>
      <li>and I was pretty happy with the product.  </li>

      <li>As I used it more and more, that did not happen again</li>

      <li>If you would like more moisturizer recommendations, please do not hesistate to reply to this review/message me.</li>
      <li>The others are fine.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is mild and agreeable, nothing fancy, just a nice, fresh scent.  </li>
      <li>The combination of olive oil and aloe looked especially promising.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also free of silicones, and petroleum products which I wanted to avoid.  </li>
      <li>I use it primarily on hands.</li>
      <li>I shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about finding these chemicals in a product from a good all natural company.</li>
      <li>My favorite body moisturizer, very gentle and non-greasy.</li>
      <li>Things I love about this lotion: it smells light and fresh instead of overpoweringly chemical-ly; it goes on light and absorbs well; and it keeps my skin super soft.</li>
      <li>During decades in nursing, and the almost constant handwashing that entails, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of hand creams and lotions, and even resorted to making my own at times, so I don&#x27;t say that lightly.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really have sensitive skin, but this sure does the trick!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years and it keeps my skin soft without too many toxins.</li>
      <li>The scent is light and pleasant, not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>The vitamin E one smells the least pleasant, though not bad.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m better off sticking to aveeno&#x27;s daily moisturizing oatmeal cream which is a product that delivers.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds over the years, but this one works well for me.  </li>
      <li>I agree with the more recent reviews.  </li>
      <li>At first pump, I marveled within and said to myself \\&quot;Ahhh, this must be good.\\</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really rich but still absorbs completely without leaving any greasiness or film.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t absorb immediately, but certainly within a very reasonable amount of time.  </li>
      <li>&quot; (I really am obsessed, I love a good moisturizer).</li>
      <li>It used to be his favorite face cream for his dry skin, but now when he uses it his face burns and he enters a panic to remove it.  </li>
      <li>The new bottles are taller than the old ones and don&#x27;t fit in my cupboard, though.</li>
      <li>It really does work with this...</li>
      <li>It is actually a very drying lotion.  </li>
      <li>I forgot to add that I had a flare up with first use as I also have very sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Not bad, just different.  </li>
      <li>I guess it wasn&#x27;t tested very well with the new ingredients.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of different lotions (drug store, organic, expensive), and this is THE BEST lotion I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>I truly recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>You would be fooled because it comes out a nice thick, creamy, luscious texture.</li>
      <li>The people who left 4 and 5 star reviews more than likely do NOT have dry skin.</li>
      <li>Perhaps it is because I am african-american, I am able to truly see the results because I see little white flakes all over my thighs</li>
      <li>I bought this lotion because I was looking for an all natural product with no harmful ingredients.  </li>
      <li>And after reading the ingredients, I have to admit that the product isn&#x27;t so natural after all.</li>
      <li>I really like it, though, and until I have the time to find out why it&#x27;s not vegan and replace it with a totally vegan one (if one exists), I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s low on the list, but shouldn&#x27;t be in an all natural product.  </li>
      <li>I bought mine in 2012, and it has &amp;#34;vegetable glycerin&amp;#34; as the 4 ingredient as well, and it&#x27;s a hot greasy mess that leaves your skin kinda sticky and</li>
      <li>I have dry, sensitive skin, and this keeps my skin from flaking and itching.</li>
      <li>Now I have sensitive, eczema-prone, VERY dry skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My favorite body moisturizer, very gentle and non-greasy.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Rub it in good.  It goes on white and then disappears as you rub it in.  Excellent for low humidity conditions.  I use it primarily on hands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used tons of different moisturizers over the years but this is the one I keep coming back to. Works well, smells great, no irritation.</li>
    <li> I agree with the more recent reviews.  I bought mine in 2012, and it has &amp;#34;vegetable glycerin&amp;#34; as the 4 ingredient as well, and it&#x27;s a hot greasy mess that leaves your skin kinda sticky and the smell isn&#x27;t very good.  I don&#x27;t like it, but I don&#x27;t mind it; my husband hates it.  I bought it in part because it was for the face...&amp;#34; and was &amp;#34;...perfect under make-up.&amp;#34;  Good luck with that!  On the driest, coldest day in winter I wouldn&#x27;t slather this stuff on my face.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion because I was looking for an all natural product with no harmful ingredients.  I know the Kiss My Face line is wonderful for that, so I snatched this up when I saw it.  I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks and I was pretty happy with the product.  It has a smell that took a couple of days to get used to.  Not bad, just different.  But I&#x27;ve come to like it and it works well to keep my skin from getting dry.  But I just looked at the ingredient list and was sad to find EDTA there.  It&#x27;s low on the list, but shouldn&#x27;t be in an all natural product.  I&#x27;ll keep using it until it&#x27;s gone, but I won&#x27;t be as happy about it.  Can companies please stop putting these things in our products.  I shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about finding these chemicals in a product from a good all natural company.</li>
    <li> This lotion is worthless and trust me I&#x27;ve tried them all so I definitely know what I am talking about. You would be fooled because it comes out a nice thick, creamy, luscious texture. At first pump, I marveled within and said to myself \\&quot;Ahhh, this must be good.\\&quot; (I really am obsessed, I love a good moisturizer). It takes a while to rub in though, so you&#x27;ve got to work those hands.  When it&#x27;s all rubbed in, it feels great..BUT then after a few minutes, I see flakes of dry skin.  This is leading me to believe that a.) It does not penetrate the skin barrier and b.) It is actually a very drying lotion.  Now I have sensitive, eczema-prone, VERY dry skin.  Perhaps it is because I am african-american, I am able to truly see the results because I see little white flakes all over my thighs and this is definitely because of the product. All because I wanted to try something \\&quot;natural.\\&quot; And after reading the ingredients, I have to admit that the product isn&#x27;t so natural after all. I&#x27;m better off sticking to aveeno&#x27;s daily moisturizing oatmeal cream which is a product that delivers.  Another product that delivers is Kiehls Creme de Corps moisturizer. If you would like more moisturizer recommendations, please do not hesistate to reply to this review/message me. This Kiss my face moisturizer is worthless. I know my moisturizers, lotions and butters and unfortunately this is a fail. It&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s free, but why make something free if it lacks the moisturizing factor?

    <li> Great product delivered to my house at a fab price on a schedule.  Pretty perfect!  Subscribe and save, folks.  You will love it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really have sensitive skin, but this sure does the trick!  I do have scaly skin and this moisturizes it well.  I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds over the years, but this one works well for me.  I realize everyone is different, so give it a try if you have flaky heels or that sort of thing.  It really does work with this... and I have used just about everything under the sun in the summer to get rid of it.  This, with regular use, does.  I got the other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; too and change it up every so often.  The vitamin E one smells the least pleasant, though not bad.  The others are fine.</li>
    <li> The third ingredient in this is isopropyl palmitate--a 4/5 on the comedogenic rating scale. It personally broke me out.</li>
    <li> Great consistency, does a nice job of moisturizing and smells wonderful. Best of all - check out the EWG.org rating on this product for environmentally friendly and safe. It&#x27;s going to be on my shopping list from now on.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son.  It used to be his favorite face cream for his dry skin, but now when he uses it his face burns and he enters a panic to remove it.  Figuring this was a coincidental fluke he tried it again a month later and again it burned his face and he was practically screaming as he washed it off.  I guess it wasn&#x27;t tested very well with the new ingredients.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and it keeps my skin soft without too many toxins. The scent is light and pleasant, not overwhelming. The new bottles are taller than the old ones and don&#x27;t fit in my cupboard, though.</li>
    <li> This is very nice lotion!  During decades in nursing, and the almost constant handwashing that entails, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of hand creams and lotions, and even resorted to making my own at times, so I don&#x27;t say that lightly.  The combination of olive oil and aloe looked especially promising.  It&#x27;s also free of silicones, and petroleum products which I wanted to avoid.  I like this well enough after trying a tube that I ordered the 3 pack of the large size, and I&#x27;ve chucked the partial bottles of other products which I still had hanging around just in case a new product disappointed me even more than they did.  It doesn&#x27;t absorb immediately, but certainly within a very reasonable amount of time.  The fragrance is mild and agreeable, nothing fancy, just a nice, fresh scent.  Most importantly, my hands are now in the best condition I can remember their ever having been.</li>
    <li> Things I love about this lotion: it smells light and fresh instead of overpoweringly chemical-ly; it goes on light and absorbs well; and it keeps my skin super soft. It is not, however, vegan; it is vegetarian, which only means that it doesn&#x27;t contain animal ingredients and wasn&#x27;t tested on animals, but that somewhere along the way an animal was involved (and I admit it, I don&#x27;t have the time to research every ingredient to see where). I really like it, though, and until I have the time to find out why it&#x27;s not vegan and replace it with a totally vegan one (if one exists), I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> very subtle scent (if any), moisturizes well without leaving my hands greasy. I have heard the parent company isn&#x27;t the most environmentally friendly, but I can&#x27;t find a lotion I like better!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for about 5 years, and it is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever found. I have dry, sensitive skin, and this keeps my skin from flaking and itching. I also use it on my face sometimes, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it causing breakouts (my skin is acne prone). This lotion keeps the skin on the back of my heels from cracking - I&#x27;ve even had a nail tech mention how nice the skin on my heels look when I was getting a pedicure! I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of different lotions (drug store, organic, expensive), and this is THE BEST lotion I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> We use this on all body parts.  I even use it as a shave cream.  I truly recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Hate hydrant want to return</li>
    <li> This is one of the best body lotions ever. It&#x27;s really rich but still absorbs completely without leaving any greasiness or film.</li>
