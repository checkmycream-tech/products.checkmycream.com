      <li>A perfect shiny top coat when your time is limited.</li>
      <li>This saves me so much time and has a bright gloss after it dries.</li>
      <li>That sounded good to me, and it really helps keep the polish on my nails.</li>

      <li>Essie &#x27;Good to Go&#x27;  dries quickly and is long lasting!  </li>
      <li>But it i far better than regular polishes, it dries quickly and prevents smudges on your nails.</li>
      <li>I really like it</li>
      <li>Dries nail polish fast and leaves a high gloss finish, but causes nail polish to be prone to chipping.</li>
      <li>My least favorite part of painting my nails is waiting for it to try and then accidently nicking them, but this polish removes that pain point!  </li>
      <li>because the polish dries so quickly, it pulls to polish back a little from the top of my nails, but I&#x27;m still experimenting with that.</li>
      <li>I tried other top coats that peel or don&#x27;t last.</li>
      <li>Really makes your mamicure last.</li>
      <li>I feel this one is real and really did come from essie because it came inside a box and the other one didn&#x27;t</li>
      <li>Rather thin but allies easily, being very glossy.</li>
      <li>&amp; this the nail polish it self had the warning labels that the other one did not have smh needless to say I know where I will be buying futher essie colors :) if available</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m a pretty active persona</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> When I opened the package, about 1/8 of the polish was already gone. It looked as if someone had used it a couple of times. When I tried to return it, I was told I couldn&#x27;t because it&#x27;s unsafe to ship flammable materials such as nail polish. This doesn&#x27;t make sense though since it was shipped to me. Would recommend the product itself, just very disappointed in the condition of the product upon receipt.</li>
    <li> very good top coat! Rather thin but allies easily, being very glossy. Regarding frying the polish, don&#x27;t expect miracles. But it i far better than regular polishes, it dries quickly and prevents smudges on your nails.</li>
    <li> There is not one top coat out there that beats this. Even when I have put on 3 coats of polish (for a bolder color), this top coat seals it in place quickly with no chips or &amp;#34;dents&amp;#34; for days. I will forever be a fan.</li>
    <li> ... just became a lot less time consuming. A friend of mine recommended the product. It is not cheap but does its job. My nails did not only dry super fast but they retained that nice glassy perfect look of the polish.</li>
    <li> Dries nail polish fast and leaves a high gloss finish, but causes nail polish to be prone to chipping.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. I got this brand because it is \\&quot;DBP, Toluene and Formaldehyde free.\\&quot;(!) That sounded good to me, and it really helps keep the polish on my nails.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite, use it fast, the product tends to get gunky if you dont use it. Mine never lasts long enough to do that. This saves me so much time and has a bright gloss after it dries.</li>
    <li> used this product three times.  Twice it was applied by a pro nail tech and once I applied it. All 3 times it started peeling off in sheets within 2 days. I threw it out. A waste of money for the polish and a bigger waste due to two ruined polish jobs on the $35 manicures</li>
    <li> This is my favorite top coat in the world. It&#x27;s the only one I use and I recommend it to everyone. It dries and hardens quickly. It&#x27;s also SO, so shiny. People ALWAYS think I&#x27;m wearing gel because it&#x27;s so shiny, but it&#x27;s just this top coat! This is probably the last top coat I&#x27;ll ever try because I don&#x27;t think anything else will ever be as great as this.</li>
    <li> Always use this one as the topcoat. Makes the polisher last a longer time and stay shining. Great choice for topcoat.</li>
    <li> This is the best top coat ever. I have been using this brand for a couple of years now. It makes my polish last for up to 2 weeks. I tried other top coats that peel or don&#x27;t last. It dries super fast. It is shiny and looks like I went to the salon. It doesn&#x27;t smell too strong like some other top coats I have tried. It doesn&#x27;t peel off. I don&#x27;t think I would paint my nails if I didn&#x27;t have this top coat. I just can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love this!</li>
    <li> Does what it promises, high shine, quick drying, chip prevention - best top coat I have found but I also haven&#x27;t tried many more since I found it!</li>
    <li> This is the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever found! Really makes your mamicure last. It also gives it a nice layer of shine.</li>
    <li> Unlike my other essie purchase from amazon. I feel this one is real and really did come from essie because it came inside a box and the other one didn&#x27;t &amp; this the nail polish it self had the warning labels that the other one did not have smh needless to say I know where I will be buying futher essie colors :) if available</li>
    <li> No Chips.. Fast drying!! I couldn&#x27;t ask for more! Salon Finish feeling! I think I&#x27;m buying a stock of them.</li>
    <li> this is the best topcoat I have ever tried. It dries super fast and with a good shine. I will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> Dries quickly, seals my polishes, this is by far the best clear coat I&#x27;ve ever used. It makes my nail polish last longer and I&#x27;m a pretty active persona and I keep very short nails.</li>
    <li> This gets the job done I really like it</li>
    <li> This stuff is incredible.  My least favorite part of painting my nails is waiting for it to try and then accidently nicking them, but this polish removes that pain point!  I do sometimes question if because the polish dries so quickly, it pulls to polish back a little from the top of my nails, but I&#x27;m still experimenting with that.</li>
    <li> Essie &#x27;Good to Go&#x27;  dries quickly and is long lasting!  A perfect shiny top coat when your time is limited.</li>
