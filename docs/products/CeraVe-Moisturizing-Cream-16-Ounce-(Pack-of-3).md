      <li>CeraVe is among the best skin products I&#x27;ve used ... good for many dry, itchy conditions as well as a general moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>Cerave lotion is a product I&#x27;m happy with and most likely will continue to use.  </li>
      <li>Clean clean!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth and easy to apply and has kept my skin moisturized, smooth, and comfortable.  </li>

      <li>Odor free.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly and has a light yet rich feel to it.</li>
      <li>Rich and smooth.  </li>

      <li>So far, I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>This has been a great help with dry skin.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product which softens even extremely dry skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Please, I am no-one special.  </li>
      <li>my dermatologist recommended this cream and she was right!</li>
      <li>Cerave is my favorite cream to keep the skin reasonably supple and not itchy.</li>
      <li>Super hydrating without greasy heavy&lt;</li>
      <li>I have allergies and mild psoriasis.  </li>
      <li>Dries quickly.</li>
      <li>It soaks in quickly and does not make you feel greasy.  </li>
      <li>Put it on your skin...and it really does the all important job of moisturizing and conditioning your skin as per optimum daily performance.  </li>
      <li>It is the first thing I put on every day!</li>
      <li>Great for whole body coverage in the dry Alaska air</li>
      <li>Simply the best for those with dry skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but seems to be worth it.  </li>
      <li>It did solve the problem so it was worth it.  </li>
      <li>so I use a large jar per week, but it is worth it!</li>
      <li>I use it right after a shower while I am  still damp.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going through chemo right now.  </li>
      <li>order arrived quickly, but one of the jars was not securely closed, dumping a significant quantity of cream inside the packaging.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and fully absorbs, isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t feel like petroleum jelly hanging around on the skin surface all day (the slimy residual feeling I&#x27;ve often experienced with other products meant for healing dry skin)</li>
      <li>I know this is supposed to be more advanced than Cetaphil, but it irritates my skin a little.  </li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t be much happier.</li>
      <li>It really helped with his eczema</li>
      <li>My dermatologist recommended this for skin damage, and it really exceeds expectations.</li>
      <li>CeraVe, is indeed the real deal.  </li>
      <li>This product has been a real life saver and ever since we started using this</li>
      <li>subtle and pleasant fragrance.</li>
      <li>For the man that just does not know which review to believe upon....or is just really confused altogether, as per all of the many brands of moisturizing creams that are of today&#x27;s many trends.....</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>This cream is absorbed quickly, and stays in your skin even after hand washing a few times.</li>
      <li>Because eczema has a high incidence in cooler climates, our pediatrician recommended to start using the whole CeraVe line in order to prevent future problems.  </li>
      <li>My friends who have mild to moderate eczema have seen total relief of their skin problems and have converted.</li>
      <li>My dermatologist recommended this, and my arms, which had been discolored for 15 years cleared up in 4 months of use, and have been clear for over 2 years.</li>
      <li>Leaves skin soft, silky, and hydrated.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve been using cerave for my daughter since she was 2 years old.</li>
      <li>It is thicker and seems to last much longer on your skin.</li>
      <li>I have a tube in my purse, a jar on my nightstand and another near my shower.  </li>
      <li>I use this all over, and it makes my skin so soft.</li>
      <li>Completely cleared my son&#x27;s eczema.</li>
      <li>Arizona has very low humidity air, so older skin dries out a lot.</li>
      <li>It is not greasy and really helps with the dry spots.</li>
      <li>Beware that some sellers on Amazon are offering multipacks which actually charge a higher per-unit price than buying individual jars while some sellers offer multipacks that actually save you money (which is what you expect a multipack to do)</li>
      <li>Very soothing on abrasions and other irritations.  </li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve been using CeraVe for the past few years, ever since my grand daughter&#x27;s dermatologist recommended it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased this for my son who has eczema. The dermatologist recommended this cream. My son likes it.</li>
    <li> Great for whole body coverage in the dry Alaska air</li>
    <li> For the man that just does not know which review to believe upon....or is just really confused altogether, as per all of the many brands of moisturizing creams that are of today&#x27;s many trends.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, I am no-one special.  But I do know my moisturizing creams!  CeraVe, is indeed the real deal.  Put it on your skin...and it really does the all important job of moisturizing and conditioning your skin as per optimum daily performance.  GET SOME!  WM</li>
    <li> Great Moisturizer.  Recommended by my dermatologist.  Wouldn&#x27;t want to spend another winter without this.</li>
    <li> My son had been using these for years.  It really helped with his eczema</li>
    <li> I read in an article on a medical website that this is recommended by dermatologists for aging skin that is getting dry, flakey ans scaly.  Yes, I&#x27;m at that lovely age where everything about your body changes!  I use this after my shower.  I put it on a dry facecloth and rub it over my still wet skin.  The facecloth picks up the extra water and deposits the moisturizer to my still moist skin, keeping the moisture in.  So far, I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but seems to be worth it.  God knows, I can&#x27;t buy new skin, so I better take care of the skin I&#x27;ve got!</li>
    <li> my son and daugther&#x27;s skin are now both beautiful. Thank you CeraVe</li>
    <li> A healthcare provider recommended this for my dry skin.  Never tried it before, but I will NEVER buy another brand again.  Goes on, soaks in, does not smell and feels great!  I have a tube in my purse, a jar on my nightstand and another near my shower.  It is the first thing I put on every day!</li>
    <li> great service! GREAT PRODUCT my dermatologist recommended this cream and she was right! it is like magic. Dries quickly. subtle and pleasant fragrance.</li>
    <li> Love this product, works wonderful for dry itching skin! I use it right after a shower while I am  still damp.</li>
    <li> love this cream, and the service was excellent</li>
    <li> Products were damaged when I received them.  Cerave lotion is a product I&#x27;m happy with and most likely will continue to use.  It is not greasy and really helps with the dry spots.</li>
    <li> Recommended to me by my Dr.  It works well.</li>
    <li> Great product, shipped timely!  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I know this is supposed to be more advanced than Cetaphil, but it irritates my skin a little.  I&#x27;ll stick with Cetaphil, which is cheaper and works better for my eczema.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by someone who said it had had an astonishing effect on their psoriasis. I can&#x27;t say the same, after four weeks of twice daily use. It&#x27;s no better or worse than any of the paraben-free moisturisers I use.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, enriching cream that works wonders on dry skin and does not leave you feeling  greasy.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going through chemo right now.  Moisturizing my skin is essential.....CeraVe is all I need.  It&#x27;s smooth and easy to apply and has kept my skin moisturized, smooth, and comfortable.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizing cream! Recommended by my dermatologist, and it&#x27;s everything she said it was...non-greasy, no perfumey smell and it works. Great deal at a great price!</li>
    <li> 100% satisfied! Best deal we&#x27;ve found yet! Excellent product! Recommend it to anyone looking for a product that does what this one does!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this and it it fantastic!  Goes on smoothly and has a light yet rich feel to it.</li>
    <li> It is very interesting to note that two skin specialists I have been associated with both recommend CeraVe.  I have used it daily for over a year and now my son, brother, wife and others are using it too.  I like the moisturizing cream that comes in the 16 oz. tub best.  It is thicker and seems to last much longer on your skin.</li>
    <li> I have allergies and mild psoriasis.  Have had it for more than 20 years.  My dermatologist recommended this, and my arms, which had been discolored for 15 years cleared up in 4 months of use, and have been clear for over 2 years.</li>
    <li> This cream is absorbed quickly, and stays in your skin even after hand washing a few times. As a nurse, I wouldn&#x27;t be without this.</li>
    <li> Completely cleared my son&#x27;s eczema. Also cleared the scars resulting from the eczema too. We all use now. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> My skin is no longer dry and feels silky. Without a doubt this is the best moisturizing cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> This moisturizing cream is fantastic. Leaves skin soft, silky, and hydrated. Perfect for all skin types. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist - and I have recommended it to friends.  It was reviewed on the Today show and there was such a run on their products they could not be found anywhere including Amazon.  That was maybe 18 months ago and now it is readily available.  It soaks in quickly and does not make you feel greasy.  Simply the best for those with dry skin.</li>
    <li> Best lotion for sensitive babies! Protects against exzema</li>
    <li> This cream is wonderful to use the year around. Not just in the winter months. My doctor turned me onto it several years ago and I have been using it daily ever since.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using CeraVe for the past few years, ever since my grand daughter&#x27;s dermatologist recommended it.  It&#x27;s a good product. no mineral oil.</li>
    <li> With severe eczema, this product has provided a lot of relief, although not completely.  It was recommended by our dermatologist and also our pediatrician.  Because eczema has a high incidence in cooler climates, our pediatrician recommended to start using the whole CeraVe line in order to prevent future problems.  My friends who have mild to moderate eczema have seen total relief of their skin problems and have converted.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using cerave for my daughter since she was 2 years old. She has eczema and her skin could get real dry. When she scratches the skin breaks up and she used to get staph infection one of which ended up in hospitalization. We tried aquaphor with little success and it used to be sticky mess. This product has been a real life saver and ever since we started using this she never got an infection once in the last 2 years. The deal is good here in amazon with the pack of 3 which comes to around $11/16 oz box. I used to buy in walmart before for $14.97. Couldn&#x27;t be much happier.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist, I have been using for about a year and have notice improvement in my overall skin condition. less dryness and flaking all around.</li>
    <li> My skin was driving me crazy with itching, flaking &amp; some strange little bumps.  I rushed to the dermo. &amp; she said buy this.  Sold.  It works.  I can still feel it protecting my skin in the shower.  I wish it was on subscribe &amp; save.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for 1 week. My skin feels somewhat softer, but I am not sure yet how rejuvenating it may be. I will try it for a month and see if it is any better than less expensive skin lubricants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The order arrived quickly, but one of the jars was not securely closed, dumping a significant quantity of cream inside the packaging. What a mess, not to mention the loss of product.</li>
    <li> A GREAT MOISTURIZER, recommended by my high-priced research dermatologist. My wife and I (both cancer patients) vouch for its effectiveness.</li>
    <li> CeraVe is among the best skin products I&#x27;ve used ... good for many dry, itchy conditions as well as a general moisturizer.  Very soothing on abrasions and other irritations.  It never remains oily or sticky and will not stain fabrics.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my third jar over the past few months. It&#x27;s a great product which softens even extremely dry skin. It goes on smoothly and fully absorbs, isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t feel like petroleum jelly hanging around on the skin surface all day (the slimy residual feeling I&#x27;ve often experienced with other products meant for healing dry skin) -- I can&#x27;t imagine ever going through another winter without CeraVe. Beware that some sellers on Amazon are offering multipacks which actually charge a higher per-unit price than buying individual jars while some sellers offer multipacks that actually save you money (which is what you expect a multipack to do) so check the math and then buy this moisturizing cream where you get a good value and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Rich and smooth.  I put it on in the shower and let soak into wet skin.  Super hydrating without greasy heavy&lt;br /&gt;residue.  Silky velvet skin every time.  Odor free. Clean clean!</li>
    <li> I am prone to eczema. This moisturizing cream seems to be the only moisturize that can prevent my eczema to happen.</li>
    <li> Just what I need for my very dry skin!</li>
    <li> Use it daily for best results.</li>
    <li> This has been a great help with dry skin.  So far I have been very happy with it.</li>
    <li> The same great Cerave product at an exceptional price!</li>
    <li> Recommended by dermatologist for skin problem.  It is a great greaseless lotion that has no fragrance.  It did solve the problem so it was worth it.  Though it is pricey it will continue to be in our cabinets for use.</li>
    <li> Love this. I use this all over, and it makes my skin so soft. You can tell the barrier that it leaves on your skin protecting it.</li>
    <li> Arizona has very low humidity air, so older skin dries out a lot. Cerave is my favorite cream to keep the skin reasonably supple and not itchy.</li>
    <li> Only product I can use on my body after life-threatening skin infections. Apply multiple times a day so I use a large jar per week, but it is worth it!</li>
    <li> I use this for my baby&#x27;s eczema as recommended by my doctor &amp; it is wonderful. I even started using it for myself! This is the best price I have been able to get for this product when compare to other stores, even with coupons.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this for skin damage, and it really exceeds expectations. My skin is less prone to itching and has less sore areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have started using it on my face. Maybe I will look younger. LOL</li>
    <li> Works wonders on my husbands red, irritated skin. It&#x27;s what dr recommended.</li>
