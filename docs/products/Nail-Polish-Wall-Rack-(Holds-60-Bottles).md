<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great for storing all my nail polishes! I thought I would only need one but I&#x27;m gonna have to get another one.</li>
    <li> daughter loves it! should of gotten two!</li>
    <li> This is a amazing great organizer for your nail polish and other make up (This is the best wonderful item)</li>
    <li> The wife loves this thing, and it was easy to install in her closet. Mama&#x27;s happy, so I am too.</li>
    <li> Great rack for the price!</li>
    <li> we love seeing all our opi colors</li>
    <li> I love this nail rack!!! It is sturdy and looks very nice when filled up. The only downside is it fills up kind of quickly &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> Love it! Fits perfectly. It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This holds a lot more than 60 bottles if they are smaller.  I absolutely love it!!  I have quite an extensive collection of nail polish and nail polish tools and this displays everything so nicely!  I wish I would have bought two.  :-)</li>
    <li> Great price and good material very easy to install</li>
    <li> This was even better than I thought. It came very well packaged. It holds 60 bottles like it says. Its good quality. Came in just a few days. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Product came well packaged, was easy to hang &amp; holds my opi &amp; China glaze products perfectly. Will be ordering another one for the rest of my collection</li>
    <li> The shipping is very expensive but it is great for holding figurines. I fit 96 ponies on the shelf and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> It looks great, it is a gift for my daughter, and I know she will love it! Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> I have some indie polishes, china glaze, OPI, essie, loreal, sally hansen..all fit in this holder. my Nicole by OPI bottles have to be turned to the side to fit, but they do fit. I fit 65 bottles with room for a few more.</li>
    <li> It works great on the wall..</li>
    <li> This was a great buy. The capacity is more than adequate for my polishes. Some are tight like the OPI and bigger Sally hansens but it&#x27;s all about organization. I have more than 60 bottles and a couple files and other tools stored safely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was very neat and precise. Installing the rack took about 6 minutes with the help of a basic screwdriver. There are more than enough nails supplied. Enjoy your rack! Haha</li>
    <li> I had a lot of polish and hate clutter. I tried to find a way to organize and display my colors so that I use all of them. It was fun getting this up  on the wall and then to colorize my nail polish in it. I can&#x27;t deny that it&#x27;s been fun buying more nail polish to round out my selection.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize I could have used a larger shelf, as described , great seller as described. Can now see what I have</li>
    <li> I store all of my Young Living Essential Oils (both 5ml &amp; 15ml bottles) and all of my Hyland&#x27;s Homeopathic Tablets in this -  I like that I can put it at my height, accessible to me but not to my little ones. They see the oils &amp; homeopathic meds and ask for me to use them on them more &amp; I remember to use them (instead of over the counter junk) since we can all see them all the time!</li>
    <li> I have two 13 year old daughters who have collected a few bottles of nail polish. It was becoming very difficult to find the colors so we hung this rack for them. The girls love it and can now easily find the color that they are looking for.</li>
    <li> I was so skeptical about getting this being the price was alittle high in my opinion.  I was worried about it being made really cheaply.  But I can say it is very sturdy and super easy to put on the wall. You will need 4 (small screws is what I used, but im not handy man lol). Took me 5 minutes to put up.  I seriously didn&#x27;t realize how much nail polish I had until I started putting them in the rack 8-| thank god I don&#x27;t plan on buying more, ill just get rid of the ones I don&#x27;t use. Anyway count your nail polishes before hand as this rack only holds 60 polishes. Makes my room feel so girly lol. Great product.</li>
    <li> The wall rack was easy to install.  Didn&#x27;t come with screws.  It had plenty of room for more polishes to come.</li>
    <li> I recently got into subscription boxes and I went from having one bottle of nail polish to having about 150 bottles (with more on the way).  I got tired of keeping all my polish in a shoebox so I decided to get this rack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty happy with this.  It&#x27;s thick acrylic and, for the most part, held up just fine during shipping (see edit below).  It does not come with any kind of hangers, it just has four holes drilled in the back.  I found some nails and hammered this into my bathroom wall.  It seems secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shelves are a perfect size to fit most types of polish.  I have about 30 different brands and they all fit.  I am getting slightly more than 60 bottles per rack, but mini polishes or Julep bottles take up less space, of course (I have a lot of Juleps).  There&#x27;s a lip around each shelf to prevent bottles from falling off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the perfect size to hang above a towel rack in my bathroom.  I feel so much more organized now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: December 17, 2014.  I&#x27;ve made some changes to the above text as it relates to my experience with these racks.  The main thing I wanted to make note of here is that there appear to be multiple slightly different items sold under the same product listing.  I have now ordered four of these (one was broken on arrival and had to be returned; the other three arrived intact).  Of these, three had five shelves and one had six.  The one with six shelves is slightly narrower in the horizontal direction.  It&#x27;s not a big deal to me, but please be aware that if you order at different times from different vendors, you may not get identical products.</li>
    <li> works perfectly on the wall.</li>
    <li> It is sturdy, and it was easy to hang. I wish it came with the things needed to hang it, but luckily I had my own.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping and held up all my polishes on my wall! Very nice rack &amp; I may have to purchase another one! Total reccomendation. Keeps everything organized!</li>
    <li> Great product. I ended up buying two. Easy to hang, look great, exactly as described.</li>
    <li> The rack I received had 5 shelves and did NOT fit 60 standard sized polishes, it only holds 50. I&#x27;m pretty upset I didn&#x27;t get the one I was promised and may be returning it. Also the quality on one side was great and on the other side the acrylic had hundreds of tiny bubbles. I didn&#x27;t care much though since you can&#x27;t see it. Overall it&#x27;s a pretty god shelf just not what I was expecting.    What&#x27;s irritating about this product page is it has TWO different product descriptions and two different dimensions and two different photographs. One being the 5 shelf one that I got, and the other being the 6 shelf one everyone else seemed to get--the one I was looking forward to.</li>
    <li> Received fast. Only complaint is there seem to be some discoloration or glue stains on the shelving areas. It&#x27;s not very noticeable when polish is on the shelves as the colors distract the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other wise great product! Easy to install and lightweight</li>
    <li> I am super happy with these!  They are a great size and very easy to install.  I choose not to put on the optional &amp;#34;nail station&amp;#34; sign so they have a clean look.  These were at my home the next day!  I am so impressed.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a reasonably priced wall mounted, nail polish holder for a long time.  I&#x27;m glad I finally found this! This is great, has enough room for all of my polishes and even has room for a few more.</li>
    <li> Holds all my polish and looks great displaying all of them!</li>
    <li> Easy to install and much better than having all our nail polish stuffed into a small drawer!</li>
    <li> Our granddaughter wanted this rack for her room to help keep her polish organized.  It does just that and it looks great on her wall;  she loves having her colors right there to look over and find one that fits her mood.  My daughter said it was easy to hang, too.  It&#x27;s a good solution for all of those nail polish bottles we tend to collect.  ; )</li>
    <li> awesome!!! I nailed it in the bathroom and get compliments all the time from my collection of nail polish.</li>
    <li> Love the product.  It was shipped very quickly, came boxed well and hung with ease in 2 minutes.  About 11 bottles fit on each row.</li>
    <li> Great product. No problems to report.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 10 yr old for Christmas. She absolutely loves it!  I&#x27;ve had my nails done 3 times already and I don&#x27;t wear nail polish normally. She has about 30 bottles of various sizes in three rows and three waiting to be filled. Construction is great, had read reviews about glue showing. I didn&#x27;t see any from the front, only when you turn it around do you see where the acrylic is fused together. It came well packaged, no breaks or cracks. There is a sign for the top saying nail polish station. Not sure if she&#x27;ll have me put that on when I hang it or not. The price is higher then I would have liked to spend but with few choices out there went with this one. Glad I did, she loves it and is excited that she&#x27;ll know where her polish is now.</li>
    <li> This product is very good. It holds all off polish and is sturdy. It looks good on the wall. It is good quality for the price. I am really glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> My fourteen year old daughter loves it. She would have never thought of it. Made the best gift. Looks good with all the colors in place,</li>
    <li> Perfect for nail polish lovers my daughter loves this rack for her nail polish she no longer have to look through a case</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price!  Definitely going to buy more of these, as my collection is getting very big!</li>
    <li> First of all, i didn&#x27;t get what the picture describes. I&#x27;m still rating 5 stars because I&#x27;m happy with what i received regardless. people complain about the glue showing and they&#x27;re right.it shows, but its not the end of the world. when i put up the rack on the wall and fill it with polish bottles, the glue doesn&#x27;t show and its not like people are gonna try to  move the rack around to inspect it. I am very satisfied! The only problem is that I now need another rack and I&#x27;m afraid to order because I want both of the racks to be the same. P.S. Dear Mr./Mrs. Seller, I don&#x27;t want the one shown in the picture!! LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: instead of 4 rows (like the picture), the one i got has 6 rows. still only fits about 60 bottles, and in some cases up to 70 depending on size and shape.</li>
    <li> These racks are fantastic. They hold a lot of bottles; they are the perfect size, and they are easy to hang. These are light in weight but also sturdy. I like being able to see the colors of my polish at a glance.</li>
    <li> This looks great in my bathroom. It was easy enough to put up. It did not come with screws but I had some so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal. It holds all of my nail polish. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great packaging and a quality product.  My only problem was that I filled it and had 30 bottles left over.  I wish I had counted before I ordered.  On the good side I&#x27;m organizing my collection and ditching some because no one needs more than 60 bottles of nail polish :)  Easy to hang too - 5 minute project and it was done!</li>
    <li> I really like this display. Now I can see all the nail polish I have without having to dump them out all in a pile on the floor! My only complaint is that the shelves could be a little wider so that my round nail polishes can fit. Other than that I am satisfied!</li>
    <li> Good product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good quality and incredible price I love it and I will recommendable to everybody i order this for my self</li>
    <li> Now my fingernail polish hangs on my closet wall instead of in a storage bin.  All the different sized bottles fit, and since its clear you can easily see what you have.  I&#x27;ve found that sometimes I have 2 bottles of almost or exactly the same color because it was buried in the bin, and I didn&#x27;t see it.  Now I can see them, they are organized, and I can buy more colors :)</li>
    <li> For starters, I would recommend this to everyone.  It&#x27;s a great rack for anyone who doesn&#x27;t have much, but if you do you should get more than one or a bigger rack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because on the box it says it&#x27;s glass, which surprised me, but it was plastic. Still sturdy, but they shouldn&#x27;t put those glass stickers all over the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They shipped it in two boxes (a box inside another box) so I thought that was good as well.</li>
    <li> I have a serious problem with nail polish - for inexplicable reasons I have an uncontrollable urge to buy a new color when I am in the beauty section of a store even though I probably have a very similar shade at home.  My nail polish bins were starting to brim over so I bought this hoping to organize them by color so I could see what shades I already have.  It does a great job holding all my nail polishes without any quality problems, it is very sturdy and easy to put on your wall (if you don&#x27;t want to screw in to the wall, use command strips--they have held up pretty nicely for me).  Now I am able to easily see what colors I already have without searching and I feel like I have my own personal nail salon in my bedroom.  For the price this is a great value and fits most of my bottles.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Yes, it has 6 rows (not 4) and it is plastic but it&#x27;s still very sturdy.  I wanted a holder with a little more pattern, color to it but that doesn&#x27;t seem to exist anywhere.  Since this is clear plastic, I just went and bought some craft paper and with double sided tape, I taped the paper to the back with the pattern facing toward where the nail polish will go!  Now I have a cool multi-color strip pattern to mine.  So cheap and easy!</li>
    <li> Great for the price. Yes you can see a bit of glue (not noticeable once filled) and no it&#x27;s not superior quality. It will do just fine to hold a ton of polish/supplies though, and its a great price! Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I really loved this nail rack and it was very easy to put up myself. However, I wish I counted my nail polish bottles before purchasing because they don&#x27;t all fit.. :( It may look big on amazon but I would recommend getting the bigger version if your a nail polish addict like me! OPI, Marc Jacobs, Essie, Chanel, Dior, and VS nail polishes all fit perfectly. The only issue I had was with the Nicole by OPI because of the shape.</li>
    <li> got this for my daughter-inlaw - she was so excited and surprised to get it - when she got home that very night she and her daughter hooked it behind their bathroom door and filled (I mean filled it) with their nail polish bottles - I know they liked it becaused they stayed up late after a long holiday get together and then they took a picture of it and passed it on to me :)</li>
    <li> From a family with all girls we absolutely love the nail polish rack. It holds all of our bottles with easy access and we can see all the colors we have. I have three already!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must have! Packaging was great wasn&#x27;t cracked and it came rather quickly! I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> it was bigger then i expected but i love it</li>
    <li> works awesome!&lt;br /&gt;so easy to set up!  also comes with a little &amp;#34;polish station sign&#x27; that is not attached so you dont have to hang it</li>
    <li> Incredibly carefully packed, extremely easy to install, and excellent proportions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes there are glue traces that show since it is clear plastic, but as other reviewers have noted, once you have even just a couple bottles in place, that&#x27;s what you notice, and not the rack itself.</li>
    <li> This worked perfectly for me.  It doesn&#x27;t hold 60 bottles of my brands of polish but I knew that before purchasing from reading reviews.  Look great in my closet.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it - just what she wanted.  It didn&#x27;t arrive in perfect condition, but is still quite useable.  Unfortunately a picture of the item was printed on the outside of the delivery box, so when my daughter accepted the delivered package, she knew what she was getting for Christmas.</li>
    <li> The looks would be good if it didn&#x27;t have what looks like dried glue in the cracks and sides if it where it was out together. It&#x27;s very noticeable and now I have to use my money and time and trouble to send it back. A very big let down!!</li>
