<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love using natural products on my hair and Light Mountain color covers my gray without damaging any hair.  My hair is healthy and the color is natural looking.</li>
    <li> This product is very safe, but it ends there.  It is very cumbersome and time consuming to use.  I called the manufacturer to find out why it made my hair orange.  They were very nice and explained well how to correct this problem, but 2nd time around I made adjustments patiently, but got horrible orange results.  Had to purchase a chemical coloring to get the orange out.  What an embarassing mess.  Would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I switched to this product when my mother passed away from her 3rd round of breast cancer.  When researching, this was the only one recommended by the Breast Cancer Awareness Society (hope I got the title right).  On a toxic scale of 1-10 the one I was purchasing from the store was a 7, Light Mountain is a 1.  I love this product.  My color is more natural looking than the box of color I was purchasing from the store.  I have the comfort of not using chemicals, covers the grey, and lasts.  As far as the hassle to use, I bring my box to the beauty shop and have her apply it.  I get my \\&quot;beauty shop treat\\&quot; chemical free.  I have medium length hair and there is such a generous amount in the package, I divide it in half now so I get two colorings from each box (and still have a little left over).  It&#x27;s well worth any inconvenience and would still highly recommend it if I did it myself due to the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice and won&#x27;t purchase again.  It takes me 4 hrs start to finish to apply.  It&#x27;s gloppy, messy and difficult to use. It will stain almost anything so be careful with it.  My results were more red than \\&quot;medium brown.\\&quot;  Probably the problem for me there is that my hair is mostly white naturally.  If it was more salt &amp; pepper, I think I would be fine with the reddish cast.  I absolutely hate chemicals and am willing to take extra time to use less harmful products but this product is much too time consuming &amp; messy.</li>
    <li> I cannot stop touching my soft, shiny hair! I am beyond pleased with my first henna-indigo experience! I spent days researching, watching videos, reading reviews and I have to say that I was more than a little apprehensive about diving into this project. My fine (strands) but thick (lots of it!), long curly medium&#x27;ish brown with gray roots, chemically colored 51 y/o hair was in need of some overdue TLC. I was done with the toxic chemicals but not ready to give in to the &amp;#34;Granny Gray&amp;#34;. Totally frustrated, I finally decided to try this. The reviews were so scary, so I purchased an arsenal of protective gear, non-metallic utensils, and lots of distilled water. I prepared the step 1 henna (used two boxes - long thick hair), covered it with plastic wrap, and let it cure for an hour while I prepared my bathroom for what I thought was going to be a mud-splattered disaster area... disposable drop cloths, lots of brown towels, rolls of paper towels, etc. Then I took a shower and shampooed my hair (no conditioner). Towel dried and combed through my hair. I added a little plain yogurt to the henna mixture, scooped some into a squeeze bottle to henna my roots first, then proceeded to cover the rest of my hair using gloved hands (use gloves through the whole process). I used plastic wrap to cover my hair, wiped off any henna that was on my skin, and then blow dried my head for about 15 minutes. Then I covered the plastic wrapped hair with a big towel, cleaned up the henna bowl and squeeze bottle, mixed up the step 2 indigo and covered it with plastic wrap. I then got in the tub and rinsed out the henna under the tub faucet... I closed the drain a few times to soak my hair in the water so it would rinse out faster. For fear of ending up with green hair, the last rinse was with distilled water. None of this thus far had been that traumatic... Oh the horror story reviews! I basically repeated the same steps with the indigo but left it on my hair for almost two hours. After rinsing out most of the indigo, I covered my hair with conditioner which rinsed out the remaining dye. There was no grit in my hair when I combed it out, just really nice smooth hair. The color is a warm dark chocolate brown with no red at all right now. From what I have read, however, the color should change a bit over the next few days. It is so soft and shiny! I have never had such wonderful results from any other hair dye! Is it a long process? Yes, but worth every second. Is it messy? Not any more messy than applying box color in my opinion... just be careful and go slowly. Does it stink? No, to me it smells like hay and it is not unpleasant at all. If you are on the fence about converting to henna-indigo... don&#x27;t let the scary reviews stop you. Be prepared with all your supplies and make a spa Saturday just for you every month! I wish I had done this years ago.

    <li> I have been using \\&quot;light Mountain\\&quot; for several months and love what it has done for my hair. It is easy to apply if you have short hair and would suggest help for longer hair.  Start at the back of scalp and work forward separating your hair into sections. I use my fingers to scoop out the mixture-I like it about yogurt consistency. I protect my clothing by putting a plastic bag around my shoulders and securing with a clothespin. Once it is applied I wrap a bag around my head and then apply heat by heating a damp hand towel in the microwave about 1 1/2 minutes and then wrap my head in a large towel. I rinse out in the shower after about an hour.  I have never had a problem with it staining my skin or shower.  I will try baking soda next time as it does make your hair stink until the next day when you wash with shampoo.  The 2 step method works well for my grey hair but fades after 2-3 weeks.</li>
    <li> There is a better way to understand and apply henna, here&#x27;s a free e-book that helps a LOT!  [...]    My biggest hint is to mix the henna the day before using lemon juice not water, the indigo is mixed up right  before you start, then stirred into the henna.  This is what gives you brown instead of the typical henna red.    Up until men thought chemicals would be better, henna has been used for centuries. The women would get together to help apply the henna then sit around doing spa type of things while the henna was absorbed.    Peroxide and the other chemicals used in \\&quot;modern\\&quot; destroys hair in order to work.  Henna conditions.... huge difference!!  My hair feels so silky and smooth after a henna treatment.</li>
    <li> Very messy. Be sure not to get it on anything because it will stain. Was like a science project mixing it up. (I will be looking for a liquid organic color.) I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough for results. Went and bought regular color. Will attempt this again at a later time.</li>
    <li> I used a lot of different hair care products, all of which had chemicals. They all promised they wouldn&#x27;t hurt my hair.  They all did.  Especially the \\&quot;herba\\&quot; one in the green box.  This one works beautifully.  I look completely natural.  My hair has great highlights where the grey used to be.  I regularly get my hair cut at fancy nyc salons and they all like my color (and trust me, they will bitch you out if they don&#x27;t)  I do not look like the aging hippy chick that I truly am.  I do not have paint brush henna head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice?&lt;br /&gt;Use no metal.&lt;br /&gt;Use distilled water even for rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;Set a lot of time aside.&lt;br /&gt;Let the mixture \\&quot;set\\&quot; for several hours before you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;Apply it while you are in the bathtub.  It&#x27;s messy as hell.&lt;br /&gt;Get a heat cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was falling out and thin.  It is now back to normal, completely.  I was a balding grey-haired woman.  I now have THICK dark hair with beautiful highlights.  I LOVE YOU GREY MOUNTAIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who cares if it takes a little longer?  It&#x27;s your hair for Lord&#x27;s Sake!  I&#x27;ll spend all day getting someone else to do my hair with harsh chemicals that make my hair dry and brittle.  This way I&#x27;m in my living room, watching tv while the color sets.  I spend 8 dollars a treatment.  And it really does condition your hair.  This is the only thing that worked.  If anything happens to this company, I will seriously completely fall apart at the seams.  You don&#x27;t know how much you love your hair until it&#x27;s threatened.</li>
    <li> I dislike the two part process, but it seems to stay on longer than other henna products I have used.</li>
    <li> I have allergies to commercial dyes. This covers the gray, and once I got used to dying my own hair, it&#x27;s pretty easy.</li>
    <li> Great product , only disadvantage  gray hair turns red And does not look good i had to use a regular  hair color product to cover the reds</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Light Mountain hair color for about 10 years now.  I have recently had to start using the \\&quot;color the gray\\&quot; product because my hair has more gray in it.  This product is always great!  The coloring process is a little time consuming and messy, but it&#x27;s worth it in the end.      I add one small cup of full fat yogurt to the final henna mix and it leaves my hair feeling like silk!  My 50+ hair is always shiney and manageable after a henna treatment.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to put chemical hair dyes on their head!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of gray hair. Instead of dark brown it makes my hair blondish brown. It washes away and becomes orange the first time I shampoo it. I really wanted an organic alternative but can&#x27; t have orange hair.</li>
    <li> The high rating is because it is so healthy that I have been able to dye my hair despite being terribly allergic to hair dyes.  I break out in a rash from every other hair dye including the nature tint one from whole foods and the aveeno natural one.  Also, it does a great job covering grays.  The only time my grays don&#x27;t get covered is when I miss a spot while dying it.  It really has excellent gray coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the downside, it is a total pain.  I let it cure for hours before I use it.  No matter what I do, my hair is redder than I would like.  I don&#x27;t heat it, I put coffee in the mix, I don&#x27;t touch it with metals, I use a darker color than I would like, etc.  I can&#x27;t be blonde anymore.  It is hard to wash out.  Even though I have now developed a good system, the second step still drips everything time...it takes over an hour once you start...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite everything though, I am grateful for a hair coloring option.  If you can&#x27;t use regular hair dye, this is for you.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to hair dye, and, being young and gray-haired, found henna to be my only option.  I have been using Light Mountain for about 7 years now.  Most of the time, it comes out great.  Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t.  It is hit or miss, since it is natural.  It is also messy.  I have perfected my technique, so I can usually get good results with minimal mess.  I use only disposable bowls, spoon, etc, and mix it over some plastic grocery bags.  I add lavender and melaleuca to the 2nd step for a nice smell.  I leave the first step on for 25 minutes (under a hair dryer the whole time) and the 2nd step for about 40 minutes (under hair dryer).  When I rinse it, I add some white vinegar to the rinse.  My hair usually turns out very nice!</li>
    <li> I started using the Light Mountain Natural at the recommendation of a friend. I could not use the brand name hair colors as they caused chemical burns on my scalp. While the application does take some time and is a bit messy, I love the natural look of the color and the condition of my hair. I reapply every 4-6 weeks as my hair grows out. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Sloppy and bright red on gray hair!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It takes a little longer than &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; hair colors, but it&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t have that awful ammonia smell!  There are great suggestions for making the color just the shade you want.  I like adding coffee and an egg. The color looks good immediately after coloring!  There is no &amp;#34;shoe polish&amp;#34; look for the first week!  Very natural looking, with lovely highlights.  And the color lasts! And my hair is so much healthier than when I used the colors from the grocery store!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I try this product, i followed all the steps and procedure, I added exactly amount of boiled distilled water but both of the powder became to hard to spread on my hair, I insist to put them on my hair finally i could just break my hair or to pull it out, at the end i could just thrown everything away and wash the paste out of my hair, can anybody  tell me what is wrong????</li>
    <li> I bought this color to cover my gray...It does a good job of doing that...But there is two part that you have to do. First it turns my roots bright hunter orange. Then you put the purple stuff on and it turns out brown. It takes some time. But does a good job...don&#x27;t worry if your hair has a little green tint to it right after, that will go away in a few hours. It isn&#x27;t really noticeable. I am going to keep using Light Mountain...but switch to their other line. (their regular henna color)...I will hope that it covers the gray. I have read some says it does an some says it don&#x27;t. lol...but will try it because I don&#x27;t like doing the two parts. It is like doing it twice.</li>
    <li> The product works. Instructions are easy to read and to follow. The conditioning part, however, was not even noticeable; that is, in other henna products, my hair was softened by the process. In the use of this one, that did not happen.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this way of coloring my hair does not cause any allergic reactions or sensitivities, BUT  it is really very difficult to find a good color to match my own hair.  My hair is very dark naturally, so when the gray roots show through, my hair looks very orange once the henna step is completed, and it is difficult then to cover the orange to get close to my natural color.  My hair still has an orange tint to it even though the color is supposed to be medium brown.  Not sure what else to do or what else to use.</li>
    <li> When I heard about non-red hennas, I did research and choose Light Mountain as my test because they seem to be the only brand with a specific process and blend for covering gray hair. I started at 7:30 this morning and was done by 10am. I heated heated bottled water in the microwave and added it to the Step 1 powder with a scrabbled egg (the egg isn&#x27;t in the directions but was recommended by a friend for stickiness). I applied with gloved hands and left that on for 30 mins then rinsed well. Then I heated more water to mix the second bag of powder (next time I&#x27;ll prep both at the same time). I again added an egg and just applied with my gloved hands. This time after I piled it onto my head I covered it with the included plastic cap. I answered email, cooked breakfast, and did laundry for about an hour and then rinsed again. When the water ran clear I applied a diluted Apple Cider Vinegar rinse and then dried my hair normally. The color of the mixture is rather alarming--a very unattractive green--but the scent is not unpleasant; it&#x27;s like a strong  herbal tea. I did stain the clothes I was wearing, but I fully expected that. :-) I have very dark brown hair and the gray is now a golden brown and my hair overall is shiny and soft. I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
    <li> OK I have used some variety of henna on my hair since I was 17 and old enough to drive to the beauty supply house myself.  I have medium brown hair and always wanted more red tones.  So I used for YEARS a product with a color called Sunset Glow, by HennaLuecent.  Went out of biz.  Bummer.  Then I found various products which were OK.  Then I started to grey.  Regular Henna did not cover it well enough.  This product has 2 phases, first is an indigo herb blend, then you rinse and apply the henna.  The dark brown looks very dark brown the first week after coloring, but it gently ages on me to a medium auburn, LOVELY.  In my youth, I was always applying just a red tone henna, first time I tried a brown.  I think the phase 1 imparts the red.&lt;br /&gt;Tips:  1) get one of those dye brushes they use in salon and use that to do your temples, by your ears, anywhere you have more greys.  And maybe use brush down your natural part to apply.  Then just spoon or hand scoop it on.&lt;br /&gt;2) you apply first part on dry hair, then rinse, and apply the henna to wet hair...so second phase tends to drip...take paper towels, several sheets in-tact together and roll them into a thin tube.  Tuck behind your ear, wrap behind nape of neck and over other ear.  Will help to catch drips.  Or if you can get some cotton cording from the salon.&lt;br /&gt;3) IMPORTANT..it can be grainy.  Hard to rinse.  On last phase, before shampooing, USE CONDITIONER!!!  It will lubricate the graininess right out.  Then shampoo, and then condition again.  Buy a cheap conditioner like suave, and use alot.  It will make it tons easier to get the product out of your hair when you rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It never ever burns my scalp, it never leaves my hair feeling stiff and stripped.  Your hair will feel great after.</li>
    <li> This is the most inconsistent, volatile product. When I called the company with questions the answers varied from person to person. When my hair turned bright red, I was told that I must have received an &#x27;old batch&#x27; of henna and the customer service rep was serious. I spent six months trying anything/everything to undo the damage of the &#x27;old batch&#x27; and finally just cut my hair. Lovely people to deal with, unreliable product. Buyer, beware!</li>
    <li> If you follow the directions you have a great outcome.  I did.  I am very happy.</li>
    <li> I ordered light mountain medium brown. Product was a little messy but my hair is now a beautiful brown color and the gray is gone. Will definitely use again and again.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using Light Mountain Natural Color the Gray Hair Color and Conditioner.  I always have received good results from using this product.</li>
    <li> Yes, it is very messy, yet that&#x27;s probably the only improved way nowadays to make natural ingredients combined to bond chemically.  Otherwise, who doesn&#x27;t want to buy big commercialized and chemically made products which are quick and easy to use.  The choice is yours: either health or convenience.  There is no free lunch in this world; it&#x27;s just as simple as that!  The directions are very specific.  Thus, if you are not mix the two parts as directed or wait long enough for the cure time, then it&#x27;s probably going to give you a less ideal result.  Duration of time in any natural or chemical ingredient affects the results.  That&#x27;s understandable to have variations from each application.  I did not do a good job covering all of my hair, so there is still a lot grays showing.  I am not blaming the product to be bad, just because my grays are still showing.  I just did not work thorough through my hair, but whatever the dye covers it&#x27;s pretty good dyed.  You just need to dedicate a Sunday to do this.  Prepare and mix the parts early, set a timer, and do house-chore or something.  Then, follow each step.  I had to do a lot of cleaning after using this product, but it&#x27;s my choice.  I rather use a non-chemically made product with a lot of trouble than hazardous one that can make me ill chronically or gradually.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001ET7KY0 Light Mountain Natural Color The Gray! Hair Color &amp; Conditioner, Medium Brown, 7 oz (197 g) (Pack of 2)]]    I have always covered my gray with over the counter products, but I hated using such harsh chemicals, as they stung my scalp and the fumes were irritating. I tried Light Mountain Natural and found it much more cumbersome to apply than the others, but I cannot believe how much healthier my hair has been since I have been using this product. I have decided, after 20 years of gray, to grow my hair out again.  It&#x27;s silkier and the coarseness from the gray has literally disappeared...this henna is wonderful.  I have found that the product is much easier to use if your hair is damp (not dry), and make sure the mixture is more watery than the box suggests...(should be like lotion, not pudding or yogurt). TRY IT!!!!</li>
    <li> I tried strand testing a number of times and it just tinted the grays</li>
    <li> If you have very short and thin hair, this may be doable.  I have very long thick hair and this was a huge mess.  I read that in the reviews but still thought it would be manageable.  Wow, I never imagined how messy it would get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mixture is thick and chunky which makes it difficult if not impossible to get in between all the hairs and around the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back to using Surya which doesn&#x27;t have to be mixed at all, it&#x27;s ready to go as-is</li>
    <li> I used it only once and covered well but did leave my hair a bit too orangey.</li>
    <li> Very messy and turned the grey and new growth hair orange. I do not have the kind of time it takes to play around with timing. I did a lot of research on this before using it. I used it according to the directions, too. I kind of expected this due to everything I read, though. It was so messy that I ended up applying it outside- lucky it was summertime. I also had to hose it out of my hair outside before showering so all the grit did not back up the drain on my septic system. There is no way that I will have time for this stuff and work too. I bought it because I was concerned to find that most permanent brown dyes contain cancer causing substances and because the semi permanent dyes were not covering my new grays. I have since gone back to the beauty supply to try another semi permanent dye instead of trying the other box of this stuff that I already bought in the 2-pack. If that doesn&#x27;t work, maybe I&#x27;ll just chance the cancer thing.</li>
    <li> The following method works effectively to dye 100% gray hair with this Color the Gray product plus unflavored gelatin and xanthan gum (essentials) and cassia obovata (optional).  It even works on dye- and stain-resistant hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would rather be a blonde or a honey-blonde, skip to the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ready for henna?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After dying my hair with chemicals for 18 years, I decided to switch to henna to be healthier.  Honestly, I was a bit terrified to do so because I had seen some women with naturally gray hair (like mine) whose hair turned orange after they used henna.  Obviously, they didn&#x27;t use indigo ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to deal with all the granules in my very thick-and-coarse curly Caucasian hair, so I experimented and made GEL.  It works very similarly to the chemical dye - no excessive dripping, no drain-clogging, no problems rinsing it out easily, no green tinge.  It took me 4 experiments and some serious study of henna and dye release online, but I finally figured it out.  Try it!  It&#x27;s super inexpensive, too!  (You only use 1/4 the amount that the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions call for.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This recipe works for shoulder-length thick, coarse, 100% gray, curly, frizzy hair previously commercially dyed and having 1\\&quot; gray roots showing.  The result is a very solid medium brown withOUT any reddish hue.  The previously-obvious \\&quot;root\\&quot; line is gone.  GREAT gray coverage.  (If you&#x27;ve never used henna before - and if you have a lot of grays showing - you may need to do the henna / indigo TWICE for full coverage - like I had to.  From here on out I plan to do the henna once every 3-4 weeks and the indigo once every 2-4 weeks as needed.  This definitely keeps the gray roots from showing too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added cassia obovata from to the powders that came in the \\&quot;Color the Gray\\&quot; medium brown box to tone down the redness of the henna.  AND - very importantly - I added unflavored gelatin (essential to make the indigo stick to my coarse hair) and xanthan gum (essential to make the gel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henna and Indigo Gel&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t clog your drains&lt;br /&gt;- uses only 1/4 of a box of Color the Gray powders&lt;br /&gt;- is as easy (or easier!) to apply as commercial hair dye&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Materials needed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color the Gray box of powders&lt;br /&gt;cassia obovata (buy from amazon or mehandi.com)&lt;br /&gt;unflavored gelatin (buy from a grocery store in the jello section)&lt;br /&gt;xanthan gum&lt;br /&gt;distilled water&lt;br /&gt;organic black tea&lt;br /&gt;non-metal mixing bowls&lt;br /&gt;stick blender or wire whip&lt;br /&gt;plastic spoon&lt;br /&gt;old clothes (that will get stained)&lt;br /&gt;old towel (that will get stained a little)&lt;br /&gt;paper towels&lt;br /&gt;newspaper&lt;br /&gt;rubber gloves (to use instead of the flimsy plastic gloves provided in the box)&lt;br /&gt;2 plastic sacks from the grocery store (to use instead of the flimsy plastic \\&quot;hat\\&quot; provided in the box)&lt;br /&gt;old conditioner bottle with a flip top to put rinse water (distilled) in&lt;br /&gt;4-cup glass measuring cup (big enough to put your hand inside)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henna (and Cassia) and Indigo Gel&lt;br /&gt;two-step applications covers 100% gray roots with solid medium brown color (NO red)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* If you have gray roots, they will be orange if you try to combine the two applications.  Don&#x27;t do it!&lt;br /&gt;* To cover gray, you MUST do two separate applications!  Henna-cassia first, then indigo.&lt;br /&gt;* If you have dye- or stain-resistant hair, you must use the unflavored gelatin to make the indigo stick!&lt;br /&gt;* If you want it darker and blacker, add 1-2 Tblsp. more indigo (Packet 2) in Step B.&lt;br /&gt;* If you want it lighter and redder, use 1-2 Tblsp. less indigo (Packet 2) in Step B.&lt;br /&gt;* If you don&#x27;t have gray roots, or if you want your gray roots to be bright orange (e.g., red hair), you can combine the henna liquid with the indigo liquid and do one application instead of two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step A:  7-9 p.m. day #1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Mix 1-2 Tblsp. henna (packet #1) + 1 Tblsp. cassia obovata + 8 oz. warm strong black tea (made with distilled or filtered water in a glass pan) in a ceramic or glass bowl; let sit 8-12 hours.  (If the caffeine in the tea bothers you, use 6 oz. warm distilled water + 2 tsp. apple cider vinegar or whey instead.)  The cassia tones down the redness of the henna so that it&#x27;s more of a dark strawberry blonde color rather than a fiery red color as the undertone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;morning day #2:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Wear rubber gloves.  Stretch the foot of a nylon stocking over a 4-cup glass measuring cup.  Pour the henna through the nylon stocking.  Squeeze the liquid out; throw the granules away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Mix 1 Tblsp. unflavored gelatin in 2-3 Tblsp. filtered water (room temperature).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Add 1 tsp. xanthan gum and the softened gelatin to the henna-cassia liquid.  Whip with a hand blender it to make gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  Remove rings, earrings, anything metal.  Rub olive oil on face, ears, neck.  Be careful to not get any oil on your hair.  Put newspaper on the floor, sink, etc. to protect the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.  Use rubber gloves to apply to hair:  cover the gray roots.  Smoosh through the hair and into the roots.  Cover with a plastic grocery bag.  Cover with a towel for warmth.  Leave in 3-4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.  Rinse under the shower faucet.  Do NOT use conditioner.  (You won&#x27;t need it anyway.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8.  Towel dry.  It will be reddish-orange, but don&#x27;t worry!  This is just the undertone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step B. Same day.  Immediately after you rinse the henna-cassia out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Mix 4 Tblsp. indigo (packet #2) + 1/4-1/3 tsp. salt + 8 oz. WARM (half boiling, half room temperature) bottled or filtered water in a ceramic or glass bowl; stir; let sit ONLY 15 minutes until the dye releases and the edge of a paper towel dipped in turns blue/green.  (Add 1-2 Tblsp. more indigo if you want it dark brown or black.  Use 1-2 Tblsp. less indigo if you want it redder.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Important:  Don&#x27;t let the indigo sit for longer than 15 minutes before you start to use it!!!!  This wasn&#x27;t clear in the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Mix 1-2 Tblsp. unflavored gelatin in 3 Tblsp. room temperature water.  Stir to soften.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Squeeze the INDIGO through a nylon stocking foot into a 4-cup glass measuring cup.  Throw the granules away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Add 1 tsp. xanthan gum + the softened gelatin to the indigo liquid and whip with a hand blender it to make gel.  Keep it in the 4-cup glass container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  (optional:  Rub olive oil on face, ears, neck but don&#x27;t get the oil on your hair.)  Put newspaper on the floor, sink, etc. to protect the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T worry about the color of the gel!!!  At this point your hair is red-orange.  The indigo gel is green/blue.  Remember the color wheel?  orange + blue &#x3D; brown.  Relax - your hair will be a nice shade of brown when it&#x27;s finished. :-)  Enjoy the process!  LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.  Use rubber gloves to apply to hair and scalp in small globs.  Smoosh into the roots and smoosh into the length of hair.  Cover with a plastic grocery bag.  Cover with a towel for warmth.  Leave in 2 hours.  (More will not be better.  Less will cause it to last a shorter period of time and/or to not stick as well or to not be as solid brown.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.  Rinse in the shower.  Condition with as much hair conditioner as needed.  Do NOT add any oil to the conditioner.  Rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8.  Towel dry.  If your hair is dry, rub a little leave-in conditioner in the ends and middle of the hair (avoid the roots).  Style.  Voila!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leftover henna and henna-cassia can be frozen.  Leftover indigo cannot (it&#x27;s useless).  I understand that if you freeze the henna, it may be a little darker then next time you use it (e.g., the red in your hair will be a little darker).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henna conditions hair.  Indigo dries it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you find that your hair is still too dry when you&#x27;ve completed the whole process, BEFORE Step A, super-moisturize your hair by leaving a combination of olive oil + vegetable glycerin or honey + conditioner + dissolved gelatin in your hair for an hour.  Rinse.  Then do the plant dyes (Step A and Step B).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gelatin adds keratin to the hair.  The henna, cassia, and especially the indigo stick to the keratin / gelatin.  Don&#x27;t worry - the gelatin absorbs into your hair and rinses out nicely.  It won&#x27;t be sticky.  (You do have to cover your head with a towel to keep it warm to aid this process of the gelatin absorbing into your hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have coarse hair, you may be able to omit the gelatin.  In my experience, the indigo wouldn&#x27;t stick very well or last very long until I used gelatin and then it stuck VERY well.  Hurray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to lighten your hair after you do the indigo (Step B), I believe you could put some olive oil in conditioner and leave that on for a few minutes.  In my experience, that caused the indigo to strip off after it was freshly applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t ever shampoo my hair (haven&#x27;t for 2+ years), so you might try going poo-less, too.  Just use conditioner from time to time.  Google \\&quot;shampoo-less\\&quot; and you&#x27;ll find lots of blogs and ideas from others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very important:  In order to keep the indigo on the hair for as long as possible, I have to mix softened gelatin in my conditioner EVERY time I use conditioner on my hair.  This has the added bonus of making my naturally dry/coarse hair softer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More info on plant dyes:  http://www.mehandi.com/how_to/brunette/index.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEFORE you do this, though, consider these options first:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Take up to 6  capsules (750mg each) of TMG (trimethylglycine) every day and make sure you get enough B5 and B6 vitamins (you could eat ¼ tsp. of rice bran / day to accomplish this).  If you do this and if you have a reasonably healthy diet, you may find that your new hairs will grow in your normal brown instead of gray.  I&#x27;ve been doing this since July and I&#x27;m definitely getting some brown hairs in where I used to have white ones. Since I&#x27;ve been going gray since I was 19 years old, this is quite the amazing thing!  Read more about TMG here:  http://www.drlwilson.com/ARTICLES/TRIMTHYLGLYCINE.htm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Make gel out of cassia obovata (it&#x27;s a plant powder like henna) and use that to dye your gray hair blonde.  It won&#x27;t lighten your brown hair but it will make your white/gray hair yellow.  I think I&#x27;m going to do this eventually because the henna + indigo process is rather time-consuming.  Just doing cassia would be easier (and less expensive).  It will just mean being a honey-blonde instead of being a medium-brown brunette.  But it will happen slowly and I&#x27;ll gradually get blonde as the hair that is dyed brown grows out.  I recently got a cute shorter haircut, so I think it will work.  Read more about cassia obovata here:  http://www.mehandi.com/shop/cassiaobovatabuy.html5 minutes before you start to use it!!!!  This wasn&#x27;t clear in the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Mix 1-2 Tblsp. unflavored gelatin in 3 Tblsp. room temperature water.  Stir to soften.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Squeeze the INDIGO through a nylon stocking foot into a 4-cup glass measuring cup.  Throw the granules away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Add 1 tsp. xanthan gum + the softened gelatin to the indigo liquid and whip with a hand blender it to make gel.  Keep it in the 4-cup glass container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  (optional:  Rub olive oil on face, ears, neck but don&#x27;t get the oil on your hair.)  Put newspaper on the floor, sink, etc. to protect the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T worry about the color of the gel!!!  At this point your hair is red-orange.

Indigo dries it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you find that your hair is still too dry when you&#x27;ve completed the whole process, BEFORE Step A, super-moisturize your hair by leaving a combination of olive oil + vegetable glycerin or honey + conditioner + dissolved gelatin in your hair for an hour.  Rinse.  Then do the plant dyes (Step A and Step B).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gelatin adds keratin to the hair.  The henna, cassia, and especially the indigo stick to the keratin / gelatin.  Don&#x27;t worry - the gelatin absorbs into your hair and rinses out nicely.  It won&#x27;t be sticky.  (You do have to cover your head with a towel to keep it warm to aid this process of the gelatin absorbing into your hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have coarse hair, you may be able to omit the gelatin.  In my experience, the indigo wouldn&#x27;t stick very well or last very long until I used gelatin and then it stuck VERY well.  Hurray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to lighten your hair after you do the indigo (Step B), I believe you could put some olive oil in conditioner and leave that on for a few minutes.  In my experience, that caused the indigo to strip off after it was freshly applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t ever shampoo my hair (haven&#x27;t for 2+ years), so you might try going poo-less, too.  Just use conditioner from time to time.  Google \\&quot;shampoo-less\\&quot; and you&#x27;ll find lots of blogs and ideas from others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very important:  In order to keep the indigo on the hair for as long as possible, I have to mix softened gelatin in my conditioner EVERY time I use conditioner on my hair.  This has the added bonus of making my naturally dry/coarse hair softer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More info on plant dyes:  http://www.mehandi.com/how_to/brunette/index.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEFORE you do this, though, consider these options first:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Take up to 6  capsules (750mg each) of TMG (trimethylglycine) every day and make sure you get enough B5 and B6 vitamins (you could eat ¼ tsp. of rice bran / day to accomplish this).  If you do this and if you have a reasonably healthy diet, you may find that your new hairs will grow in your normal brown instead of gray.  I&#x27;ve been doing this sinceJuly and I&#x27;m definitely getting some brown hairs in where I used to have white ones. Since I&#x27;ve been going gray since I was 19 years old, this is quite the amazing thing!  Read more about TMG here:  http://www.drlwilson.com/ARTICLES/TRIMTHYLGLYCINE.htm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Make gel out of cassia obovata (it&#x27;s a plant powder like henna) and use that to dye your gray hair blonde.  It won&#x27;t lighten your brown hair but it will make your white/gray hair yellow.  I think I&#x27;m going to do this eventually because the henna + indigo process is rather time-consuming.  Just doing cassia would be easier (and less expensive).  It will just mean being a honey-blonde instead of being a medium-brown brunette.  But it will happen slowly and I&#x27;ll gradually get blonde as the hair that is dyed brown grows out.  I recently got a cute shorter haircut, so I think it will work.

    <li> Produces a healthy looking color on my chemically damaged hair, which is what I hoped for. The base tone is typically henna-red, but is better than premature gray! The color fades gradually rather than producing a drastic white stripe. As with most henna products, this requires a moderately messy two-step application process that takes a few hours. But it is extremely gentle, good for your hair. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> It was as described.  Only drawback is that it&#x27;s more time consuming to apply, a little more work involved.  But the knowledge of the safety of no harsh chemicals trumps the inconvenience.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> For starters, I&#x27;m not Nicholas, I&#x27;m his wife, a female:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago, I lost a dramatic amount of hair.  I have grey hair, about 30- 40 percent, but I had to stop dyeing it. So I switched to the brand that  is in the green box and has the word \\&quot;herb\\&quot; in it, but it has chemicals and still fried the hair off of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say dyeing your hair doesn&#x27;t contribute to hair loss.  They lie.  My hair IMMEDIATELY improved when I started hennaing only, but at first I couldn&#x27;t really cover the grey.  And it took hours to only kind of color the grey.  Then I switched to the Light Mountain and yes it was messy and time consuming, but in the end, I looked like I&#x27;d been to a salon.  It actually looked better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix both packages when I wake up and use a lot of powdered ginger to mask the smell.  I get a good movie and a heat cap set up in the living room and a ton of towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use distilled water to rinse my hair before and after I henna.  I use tap water to get the henna out but then rinse with distilled just to make sure no rusts or minerals rest in my hair because henna can turn your hair green but NOT IF YOU&#x27;RE CAREFUL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply the henna while I sit in the bath tub and then immediately shower off my body and the bowls and the tub.  I have a big mirror I take in there with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I towel off and go watch movies.  I use a heat cap but that&#x27;s not really necessary.  In half an hour, I go rinse with tap water, rinse with distilled water and repeat the application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it a hassle?  Yes. But my god, are you kidding me?  I was BALDING and grey!!! Now I have thick beautiful dark hair with salon quality highlights.  I want to go find the people at Light Mountain and give them a medal.  It&#x27;s the best hair coloring I&#x27;ve ever had and I&#x27;ve been to top salons.  And it costs twelve dollars?  Seriously?  It would cost $700 to have a pro get it into this condition.  Who cares about a little mess and time spent watching a movie?  There&#x27;s a really good essay out there by bell hooks about taking care of appearances and why it&#x27;s important and empowering....why does everything have to be so instant anyway????????  I only have to do it every few months because the color does not fade!  There is no skunk line.  So four times a year, I spend a day pampering myself.  It&#x27;s AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It does stink.  I sprinkle  baking soda on my hair after wards then rinse with 2 cups of water and teaspoon of vinegar to reduce the smell, or this time, I&#x27;m going to try tomato sauce!  Be ready with matches and candles and incense!  The smell is really barfy wet-dog.  But it&#x27;s my hair!  I don&#x27;t care!!!! It fades almost immediately.</li>
    <li> Just finished with my third time using this product and love it.  I&#x27;m disappointed I waited until I&#x27;d spent many years and lots of money on chemicals that are so toxic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time ever dying my hair was with this product. I did an overall coloring and it turned out a nice shade of brown! though darker than I expected.  The next two have been roots only.  I have gotten better each time at minimizing the mess so I kept the review at five stars.  It does stink a little, but goes away after a washing or two.  It takes 2-4 hours depending on how long you leave it on, but if you plan ahead and have all supplies ready, it goes faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you are certain you want to abandon chemical dyes, once you do henna you must let it grow out before going back to chemicals.  I knew there would be no return for me, but it is something to consider.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length graying hair that was chemically dyed about 4 wks ago.  I was very worried about ending up with seriously RED hair but because of the damage all the regular hair dyes was doing to my hair I decided to give this natural product a try.  There are only 3 ingredients listed on package, henna, senna and indigo.  It comes in two pouches that you need to mix with hot water and let cure. I let packet one cure for 15 min and packet two for 30 minutes as directed.  Left packet 1 on hair for 15 minutes.  My hair was carrot top ORANGE.  No panicking yet. Packet 2 went on for 1 hour, then rinsed out.  My hair was now a dark brown with greenish tint.  I panicked just a little but decided to wait it out.  Went to bed and awoke to a warmer brown shade of hair, much better!  I waited a full 48 hours to shampoo hair and I would say the best color really came out on day 2 - 3. My first shampoo did cause a bit more blue-ish color rinse water but no messes after that.  It&#x27;s now been a week after coloring and every time I look in the mirror I think \\&quot;I LOVE MY HAIR\\&quot;.  I can&#x27;t remember ever having such a beautiful warm brown color with very natural looking highlights sprinkled in.  I&#x27;m so glad I trusted the process, followed directions, and waited for the full results.  My advice would be don&#x27;t plan on going out the day you use this product, but after that, you will be happy.  Also the night I used it, I could not stop touching my hair because it felt so soft.  I will definitely use this again, in fact I can&#x27;t wait to use this again.  As for the mess, as one other person mentioned, think of this as a beauty treatment.  It&#x27;s worth it!!!</li>
    <li> I found the other positive reviews so helpful that I wanted to share my own review.    I am in my mid-40&#x27;s with about 10% gray hair. I have very curly, dry brown hair. My hair has never felt better than after using this product! So soft and shiny, and the covered grays look like subtle highlights and totally natural.    My comments:  I would definitely recommend, as someone else did, to mix up the hennas early and let them sit for several hours. I let mine sit for almost 3 hours. It does say in the directions that this will help it all to go faster. It took only 15 minutes for part 1 and 45 for part 2.  Do the strand test as recommended.  I used a garbage bag clipped around my shoulders to keep my clothes clean.  I used a plastic grocery bag clipped around my head to keep from dripping.  If you wash your skin off quickly it does not stain your face.  If you wipe up where it drips quickly, it does not stain your floor or sink or tub.  Use the baking soda as recommended to help get the henna completely out of your hair  I only used half a package as my hair is medium length, so I will get 2 treatments out of one box.    It really wasn&#x27;t that bad of a process at all. Well worth the little mess to avoid toxic chemicals!    Follow up (added March 2013): The first time I used it, the grays began to come back slowly within a week or two. I called the company, and they instructed me to leave on the Part 2 henna for 2 hours, instead of 45 minutes. I did this, and it was perfect. So if you are having this issue, just leave the Part 2 on for longer and it will be fine. They have great customer service, so if you have trouble, definitely call them first before you give up!    Follow Up (added January 2015): The last time I used it in December, I did not get the same results of gray coverage as I had been getting. When I contacted the company, they told me that sometimes after using the product for awhile- it had been almost 2 years for me- this can happen because it may no longer adhere to the grays. My grays are only at the hairline and top of my head, so it&#x27;s not even like I&#x27;m covered with gray. So I decided to take a break from this product and try another henna brand.</li>
    <li> This henna is a bit more work but the results are great. It left my hair shiny, bouncy and it covered well my grey hair. It lasts about 5-6 weeks. Worth the extra work because it doesn&#x27;t damage hair at all, infact it improves it.</li>
    <li> I Have been using Henna Hair dye for about 3 1/2 years and have never been quite satisfied , even by buying some top quality Henna Brands.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is short, baby fine, lots of grays. The grays have always turned out 2-3 shades lighter than the rest of my hair and not giving me the look that I had hoped to achieve.After reading reviews and doing some research I decided on this product in medium brown . Suggestions : Please wear old clothes that you won&#x27;t cry over if they get hit with a glob of henna dye, make sure you have at least 3-4 hours  because that is about how long it is going to take...&lt;br /&gt;Step one Product is very unforgiving if you get it on anything and do not immediately clean it up, stains yellow- orange.&lt;br /&gt;Step two since I was looking for brown brown results, I used an egg, three tbsp squeezed lemon juice and 1 tsp of Nutmeg (nutmeg adds a pleasant fragrance).&lt;br /&gt;Make sure also in step two that the henna mixture is creamy, like cake batter and not thick like pudding, this way it can distribute easily throughout your hair and get down to the roots.&lt;br /&gt;I had extra hair caps and glad since the one they give you don&#x27;t have elastic, looks like a plastic bag. I also had other gloves that fit better than the plastic pair they give you that wants to slide off your hands and fingers.&lt;br /&gt;I left step one on for 15 minutes, using a hair dryer for 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I left step two on for 2 1/2 hours, rinsed out .&lt;br /&gt;Results: For the first time the areas I recently had problems with were gone....some areas of gray look possibly a tiny bit lighter like highlights of a coppery brown but the major areas that were 2-3 shades lighter are brown now !&lt;br /&gt;This is a very sloppy, time consuming process but well worth it... I am very pleased with the results....&lt;br /&gt;My husband helped me and if you can I suggest you have a helper, that way you will make sure the back of your hair gets covered evenly .&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know yet how long it will be before it startsfading, in the past since I wash my hair every other day it was two- three weeks .&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed ....</li>
