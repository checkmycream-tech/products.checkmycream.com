### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Which work excellent.</li>
      <li>Great Price!</li>
      <li>Andis clippers and blades are the best.</li>
      <li>Andis makes the best clippers and blades in the industry.</li>
      <li>I am very glad there is this replacement!</li>
      <li>Excellent, so here is 18 more words to fill out the requirement, I reviewed on the Clippers for everything involved!</li>
      <li>This razor works great for us.</li>
      <li>great company teh razor and replacement blade are great</li>
      <li>Your clipper guards will fit perfectly on this #000 blade.</li>
      <li>WELL AND NICE</li>
      <li>I love this blade, it&#x27;s perfect, doesn&#x27;t get hot, and cuts evenly.</li>
      <li>Got what I paid for, pretty happy but it could be cheaper.</li>
      <li>i love this product..</li>
      <li>should, it cuts more like a #00000.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE IT BECAUSE IT DOES THE JOB</li>
      <li>Love the ceramic blades way better than the steel.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Only one star -- zero would be more appropriate.  </li>
      <li>much better cut</li>
      <li>Overall I am very happy with the andis line of products.</li>
      <li>This new one arrived fast and cuts superbly.</li>
      <li>I had purchased the horse clipper and then realized that blades were easily changeable.</li>
      <li>and it works fine.</li>
      <li>Yes, I believe my #00000 to be accurate.  </li>
      <li>This replaces the original one that came with the razor because I dropped it on the tile and one of the blades cracked.</li>
      <li>Hi to be true</li>
      <li>These blades work really great and run cool as expected of ceramics.</li>
      <li>/&gt;1) 0.5 mm is pretty easy to measure with a high-quality metal scribed ruler.  </li>
      <li>Fast delivery and easy to order.</li>
      <li>Probably a 3 since it runs nice and cool for long periods, but</li>
      <li>Great for bald fades or all over bald head without cutting or bruising the scalp, leaves head feeling smooth and the blades stay cool and are easy to clean.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent blade to use under an extension comb but the teeth are not smooth enough to use by itself - these blades seem to vary a lot that way</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t get hot like the steel ones.</li>
      <li>Now, if Andis labeled it as and sold it to me as a #00000 -- and if I had actually *wanted* to buy a #00000 -- you would see a higher rating from me :)  </li>
      <li>Really all you could ask for in a blade, I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It is closer to 0.1mm but that is much harder to measure accurately with the tools I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I purchased the new blade to compliment those trimmers.</li>
      <li>Buying this part is cheaper than buying a new tool and after replacing the part, the tool cuts like new.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m not happy for this ceramic blade if u can replace it for me the regular metal blade that will be great thx</li>
      <li>I own several other #000 blades, but this is the only one that is an Andis Ceramic, so</li>
      <li>I beg to differ, they are super sharp, my complaints lie elsewhere.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Someone in the reviews said these are not sharp.  </li>
      <li>i didn&#x27;t like it at all, because they not cutting sharp especially triple zero</li>

<li> .. lasted long time.....</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t comment on how long they remain sharp as my usage is not nearly that of a professional, but I&#x27;ve not had to replace a blade for dullness at all (been cutting with these on an Andis BGRC clipper for the last 6 years)</li>
<li> the guard tines are too sharp and leave</li>
<li> Cool, smoooooth cutting.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using the Ceramic Edge blades for a while (I&#x27;ve got a set of 7 different blades, from #000 to #3) for cutting my family&#x27;s hair, and the first thing I noticed is that the blades run cooler that the steel sets I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
<li> or if I have one that slipped past quality control.  </li>
<li> after following up with the Andis Ceramic #000 tells you it is cutting closer than a #00000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> , I CAN NOT SAY ANYTHING BAD ABOUT IT</li>
<li> This blade is badly mis-adjusted or mis-manufactured, or something.  </li>

    <li> i love this product.. great company teh razor and replacement blade are great.. lasted long time.....will continure to use Andis products</li>
    <li> Got what I paid for, pretty happy but it could be cheaper.</li>
    <li> Love the ceramic blades way better than the steel. Doesn&#x27;t get hot like the steel ones. I have these in every size.</li>
    <li> These blades work really great and run cool as expected of ceramics. I&#x27;ve owned and used several of them over the last decade. I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> This replaces the original one that came with the razor because I dropped it on the tile and one of the blades cracked. I am very glad there is this replacement! This razor works great for us.</li>

    <li> Great Price! Fast delivery and easy to order. I have used ceramic cutter blades to clip show animals and they out last any metal blade I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT BECAUSE IT DOES THE JOB WELL AND NICE , I CAN NOT SAY ANYTHING BAD ABOUT IT</li>
    <li> Hi to be true i didn&#x27;t like it at all, because they not cutting sharp especially triple zero they pulling people  hair so I&#x27;m not happy for this ceramic blade if u can replace it for me the regular metal blade that will be great thx</li>
    <li> Overall I am very happy with the andis line of products. I had purchased a regular size clipper 2 years back and it works fine. I had purchased the horse clipper and then realized that blades were easily changeable. I purchased the new blade to compliment those trimmers. Which work excellent.</li>
    <li> It dosnt cut as short as i thought. my machine came with a blade that cuts shorter</li>
    <li> This is an excellent blade to use under an extension comb but the teeth are not smooth enough to use by itself - these blades seem to vary a lot that way and I always wonder why.</li>
    <li> One of these came with my Andis BRCG / BCRG or whatever it&#x27;s called.  I&#x27;ll be brief and to the point.  This blade is badly mis-adjusted or mis-manufactured, or something.  It does not cut as a #000 blade should, it cuts more like a #00000.  I own several other #000 blades, but this is the only one that is an Andis Ceramic, so I don&#x27;t know if the problem applies to all Andis Ceramic #000 or if I have one that slipped past quality control.  Now for the details if anyone cares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) 0.5 mm is pretty easy to measure with a high-quality metal scribed ruler.  This is not.  It is closer to 0.1mm but that is much harder to measure accurately with the tools I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The fact that I can shave with my #00000 then get clippings (and a smoother finish!) after following up with the Andis Ceramic #000 tells you it is cutting closer than a #00000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Yes, I believe my #00000 to be accurate.  I have several #000, one #0000, and several #00000 and they behave as I would expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one star -- zero would be more appropriate.  Mine is simply *not* behaving like a #000 blade.  Now, if Andis labeled it as and sold it to me as a #00000 -- and if I had actually *wanted* to buy a #00000 -- you would see a higher rating from me :)  Probably a 3 since it runs nice and cool for long periods, but the guard tines are too sharp and leave scratches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone in the reviews said these are not sharp.  I beg to differ, they are super sharp, my complaints lie elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Cool, smoooooth cutting. Jury out on longevity.</li>
    <li> Dropped the one I had and broke several of the metal teeth. This new one arrived fast and cuts superbly. I prefer using Marvel Mystery Oil with these blades. Andis makes the best clippers and blades in the industry.</li>
    <li> Excellent, so here is 18 more words to fill out the requirement, I reviewed on the Clippers for everything involved!</li>
    <li> I received everything that I believed it would be. Buying this part is cheaper than buying a new tool and after replacing the part, the tool cuts like new.</li>
    <li> I love this blade, it&#x27;s perfect, doesn&#x27;t get hot, and cuts evenly. Really all you could ask for in a blade, I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great for bald fades or all over bald head without cutting or bruising the scalp, leaves head feeling smooth and the blades stay cool and are easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Andis clippers and blades are the best. I&#x27;ve used Wahl and Remington but they don&#x27;t hold a candle to Andis. Your clipper guards will fit perfectly on this #000 blade. If you&#x27;re looking for an even tighter cut, don&#x27;t forget to pick up a #00000 as well.</li>
    <li> stick with oster brand much better cut i&#x27;ve used oster and wanted to try something different big mistake stick with oster brand</li>
