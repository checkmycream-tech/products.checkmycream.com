<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The shampoo was a new experience compared to my previous shampoo. When I washed my head I didn&#x27;t feel the suds like how my old shampoo gave. I have oily hair so lets see how it goes as the day goes on by. Overall, it feels like every other shampoo, except it feels like you are putting on conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many anti-dandruff shampoos for my itchy scalp and this finally is doing the job i looked for in a shampoo. I had to shampoo every day to not have itchy and greasy scalp but i can forgo a couple of days and still be left with soft and clean hair. I can finally use all the styling products, which were otherwise a huge no-no with my greasy hair. Make sure to leave the shampoo in for a couple of minutes for it to do its magic. This is a review after a month of use and it works great for me. i just wish it had a more pleasant smell to it but i always condition my hair later so it not a huge issue for me.</li>
    <li> The product was extremely drying.  It will strip your hair and scalp of any moisture.  It irritated my scalp to no other causing way more dryness and itch than ever before.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a fresh clean scent and leaves my hair so squeaky clean and shiny. It doesnt strip it of moisture.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is horrible. My hair is literally worst after using it. I&#x27;m still trying to undo the damage. I purchased this product because I have somewhat damaged hair from using the hair straightener but my roots get oily quickly. After using this shampoo, I didn&#x27;t see much help with the oil issue, my hair become oily after the 3rd day being unwashed which was typical however, I did notice that it was drying out my ends really badly and I wasn&#x27;t even applying the shampoo on my ends at all. I was also using the Argan oil conditioner which I also wrote a review on and it didn&#x27;t help much. The conditioner was a little better than this shampoo because it smelled nice and it didn&#x27;t damage my hair but it also didn&#x27;t help it. I have since stopped using these (very expensive and ineffective products) and have returned to my regular drug store shampoo and have been using a million masks and treatments to regain the moisture in the ends of my hair. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine has maple holistics degrease shampoo and let me try it. While I only used it once, my hair that day felt lighter and less weighed down but still moisturized. The smell was clean and refreshing. I plan on getting this for myself and look forward to seeing the long term results.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I bought this. I have no idea why, but after I had my first son eleven months ago, I had the worst case of itch scalp and flakes. It was disgusting and so embarrassing. I tried almost everything. I used Head and Shoulders, Selsun Blue, Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree Shampoos and Conditioners, even more expensive shampoos and conditioners recommended by my hair stylists and nothing worked. I finally did a little research and decided to try natural shampoos and conditioners. I saw a difference with the first use. My head stopped itching, I still had a little flakes here and there but it&#x27;s a huge difference. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for almost a month now and the results are still amazing. I still have some dry flakes after shampooing sometimes but it&#x27;s not that bad. I&#x27;m not a fan of the conditioner, same brand (Maples Holistic Silk 18) though. It does not moisturize my hair at all. I&#x27;ve ordered a different brand and hope that week be better. But I&#x27;m so glad I bought this shampoo. I recommended it to a coworker too, hope it helps her like it&#x27;s helped me.</li>
    <li> i looove this shampoo for oily and itchy hair what a great product</li>
    <li> This stuff is truly amazing.  It doesn&#x27;t just strip your hair of moisture like some other salon grade degreasers.  It actually PREVENTS your locks from becoming oily through out the day.  This is the only shampoo I have found that keeps my hair in check all day long.</li>
    <li> good,but less than i thought.</li>
    <li> I have losing hair problem beacuse of greasy hair, and feel itchy all the time.&lt;br /&gt;So I have tried so many named brand degrease shampoo, but none of them work out for me.&lt;br /&gt;For the last 2 weeks with using the Maple Holistics shampoo daily, the itchy feeling is gone and  I feel the oily hair situtation had been change.&lt;br /&gt;I hope it will improve hair’s moisture level, less greasy and keep the scalp away in long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the CONS with this shampoo is the do not provide the large size or family size.</li>
    <li> I am glad the company sent a sample to try.  The packaging is great in a sealed bottle.  It is very effective in control oily scalp.  However, I am not fond of the scent.  It almost smelled like plastic.</li>
    <li> My 13 year old daughter loves this shampoo!  She was having problems with an oily scalp that was worse at the crown.  The typical clarifying shampoos didn&#x27;t really help and dried her hair.  I have a shower full of half bottles of shampoo that didn&#x27;t help her problems. Now her hair looks healthier and not greasy at all.  Degrease Shampoo really lives up to it&#x27;s name!</li>
    <li> The product did not work for me as it did for others.  I am giving three stars since I am impressed that the company lived up to their guarantee and refunded my money.</li>
    <li> This product is save my stress.&lt;br /&gt;I have very thin oily hair and also my scalp always greasy, rashes, and itching.&lt;br /&gt;I have to wash my hair everyday if not my hair stocked together by oil and itchy scalp so I have to scratch my scalp all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using this shampoo almost 2weeks now, I wash my hair once in two days.&lt;br /&gt;Reduced oil and itchy my hair and scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I just received this product on Friday afternoon. I have been having issues with scalp irritation and itching. Additionally, my hair is on the fine/thin side. I have used this product twice so far, and I am pretty impressed. My scalp doesn&#x27;t itch nearly as much. The shampoo makes an incredible lather, and my hair looks clean/fluffy. Usually I have to smother my hair in products to make it look like something. Today, I went to work with just a bit of hair spray and a hair clip. I am very impressed. I am also hopeful that I will find my scalp and hair in better health as I continue to use this product. I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Don&#x27;t use too much. You won&#x27;t need it. I shave my head to a #1 blade and mountain bike a lot. This product is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ll need to give it some time before I can really review it in full, but for I now I like it.</li>
    <li> the only thing I was dreaming of is to get my hair less greasy to not wash it everyday. I&#x27;ve been waiting to write review until I finish the bottle to make a fair judgment. Well,&lt;br /&gt; I like  how crispy clean my hair is after the wash. But that is the only one good thing.  I could not comb my hair without using conditioner. The next day my hair was as greasy as after any cheap shampoo. When I was halfway on this bottle my scalp got so itchy that I had to stop using it.  I won&#x27;t buy it again as it did not work for me. But I will try something else since the company offers a free bottle for writing  reviews.</li>
    <li> O.M.G - I love it!  I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair everyday with this product, and my hair isn&#x27;t as greasy!</li>
    <li> Only shampoo I use. I was using NaturOli oily to normal shampoo, but the next day my hair would seem real greasy, after using it for 6 months and nothing stabilizing, I had to switch. I can now go a day (sometimes 2, shhh don&#x27;t tell) without washing my hair! Love this stuff. And since I don&#x27;t need to wash my hair as often then it also helps with the price!</li>
    <li> Seems to work, however leaves my hair a bit tangled after washing. Conditioner is needed.</li>
    <li> I stumbled on to this product here at Amazon and I was inspired to purchase it by the reviews of my fellow Amazonians.  I used used the product for the first time and I can feel and see the difference in my hair and scalp - there&#x27;s a cleansing agent and the shampoo does not strip the oils but rather controls the oils.  Scalp feel great.  My only compliant and it really isn&#x27;t a complaint is the scent of the shampoo.  It is not unpleasant but I was hoping for more of an earthy or &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; smell - I find it more of an almondy or nutty smell.  Again, not offensive and certainly would not stop me from using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin hair but lots of it and after shampooing and just air drying, my hair is a mane!  The shampoo provided great volume and I love how my hair looks and feels.  The shampoo really makes it feel as the hair and scalp has been cleansed well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading most of the good, bad, and ugly reviews...I will update this review to see if the product continues to work and not cause any adverse issues.  I realize that no one shampoo can be the be all to everyone and many people probably have other medical issues that just a shampoo may not be able to correct or reduce,  but I will keep an open mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy to have stumbled on to it and I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does not solve the problem with oily hair. It is very expensive for something that doesn&#x27;t work as advertised.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing. I have had an itchy, irritated scalp ever since I made the switch from washing my hair every day to every 2-3 days... It has been really frustrating and obviously uncomfortable. I have areas of my scalp where there are recurring scabs, and it&#x27;s super dry (although it&#x27;s also very oily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything got better when I started using the shampoo, but I thought it was just me / just luck and refused to attribute it to the shampoo... I used it for about 4 months. When I finished the bottle I tried a natural tea tree oil shampoo (that is cheaper of course) and my scalp is now back to how it used to be. So here I am, buying the shampoo again ;) I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
    <li> It did not work for me. I still had to wash it as usual, but my scalp was itching even more, more scaling and more hair fall. Had to switch to another shampoo.</li>
    <li> Just received a sample of this from the company website. It made my hair nice and soft and pretty. When I first washed my hait it felt stiff and weird so I added a tiny bit of conditioner, which I normally don&#x27;t use, an after blow drying my hair it feels very nice. I really don&#x27;t care for the smell of it. It&#x27;s not horrible but it&#x27;s kind of a mint and chemical smell.</li>
    <li> I have oily hair. Always have and always will probably, it&#x27;s a fact. So, during my quest to find the perfect shampoo to battle this problem I found highly rated and highly praised Degrease. Lots of shampoos claim to control excess oil but I have been disappointed by almost every one of them; that is until I tried Degrease. I made sure to follow the directions as closely as possible and I was pleasantly surprised at the results. My hair actually felt clean and very light once I got out of the shower. It definitely felt as if this shampoo was able to take away all the gunk (TMI sorry) out of my hair, leaving it feeling refreshed. The next day my hair was still fabulously oil-free and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who is tired of dealing with oily hair.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S A SMALL BOTTLE FOR THE PRICE. HOWEVER I MUST ADMIT IT SMELLS SO GOOD BUT I DIDN&#x27;T GET THE RESULTS I WAS LOOKING FOR.</li>
    <li> Degreased pretty well! had grease free hair for a couple of days. This product smells very good also. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used on my oil-prone hair, but I wish it could still be more effective. I have short hair (pixie cut), but I still need to wash my hair every other day before it starts to get a little itchy and greasy. This shampoo definitely cleans better than the other brands, though, and has greatly reduced the dandruff in my hair. It has a pleasant smell and is gentle on your scalp and hair. I use ACV as my conditioner, and so far this combination has worked well for me.</li>
    <li> Despite being a college student who can&#x27;t really afford to spend about 20 dollars on shampoo, it&#x27;s worth the investment for anyone with overly oily hair.  I don&#x27;t struggle nearly as much with oil issues as I used to when I used in-store, inexpensive options.  The bottle also goes a long way!  I&#x27;m almost at the two-month point and have lots of product left.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product for my wife and after using so many Shampoos, she thinks this is the one she was looking for. This product is suitable for her hair type, although there are many products in the market which claims to be suitable for a certain hair type but they are actually not. So this product is actually delivering what it is claiming.</li>
    <li> I took a chance and ordered this for my teen with oily scalp.  I have bought so many different items claiming to work but had poor results. Found this items on amazon, saw the positive reviews and took and chance.. and glad I did. My teens hair looks much healthier and most importantly she feels more confident. Very good product - highly recommended!</li>
    <li> After trying so many shampoos for oily hair with varying degrees of success I am really not sure there is a remedy for the problem. Though I will say that this shampoo has helped. Although, I still need to shampoo daily, I have noticed that my hair does not get oily as quickly.</li>
    <li> First of all, let me say this smells great. It falls right in with the essential oil trend that is going on. Second, after using this for a month I do notice a slight difference in the greasiness of my hair, and a very positive change in the itchiness of my scalp. I only shampoo about every-other day and use a light application of dry shampoo if needed. I can use this product at night, and wake up in the morning with clean hair. I have not been able to do this for a long time. I will continue to use this shampoo, and hopefully continue to see a difference in the condition of my hair and scalp. Until then, only 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It smells really nice and my head always feels super clean after using it.  It was great for treating my symptoms, however, it did not solve my oily scalp problem with long term use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What did solve my problem was:&lt;br /&gt;1. I quit washing my hair every day and cut back to every other day.  I used baby powder and dry shampoos on days when I did not wash my hair to manage the grease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  I started using milk of magnesia on my face and after a week my face oil production was under control. So I started dabbing it onto my scalp the night before I was going to wash it.  After about a week of doing this, I haven&#x27;t had to use the dry shampoo on my non hair washing days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying out various shampoos for a couple of years. My hair is oily and thin and most of the shampoos left my hair limp and I had to wash it every day. Not to mention that most natural shampoos don&#x27;t lather and smell weird.&lt;br /&gt;With this one none of the above is a problem anymore. It&#x27;s a small bottle but the shampoo is very efficient, lathers wonderful and smells nice. I love that it adds a lot of volume to my hair, does not tangle it (even without conditioner) and I can easily wash my hair every other day. Finally I could stop looking for a right shampoo.</li>
    <li> Stop complaining people. This shampoo is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negative reviews here have nothing to do with the shampoo. One says it was leaking, the other says its good but expensive. People, please. The company replaces for free anything that got damaged during shipping and don&#x27;t even make you send the bottle back.Twenty bucks is a small price to pay for a healthy scalp. I spend more than that on a shirt in Marshalls.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo makes my hair not oily. Bottom line. Works well, I&#x27;m a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> I Received this degrease shampoo from a friend as as gift. My daughter, who&#x27;s only a pre- teen, has had oily hair for about 5 years now, that tends to get very greasy on the scalp. And she&#x27;s always complaining it itches only after a day of not washing. I&#x27;ve tried so many products, even took her to the doctor who recommended a product that only made things worse. . Any product I&#x27;ve used has only caused it to worsen, look greasier and very oily. And we all know how oily hair looks so flat, and dirty! The more expensive store bought products (like pantene, herbel essence) only made it greasier &amp; itchier! So when I received this organic degrease shampoo from as friend,  i was not very hopeful. HOWEVER,  After only one use, we could not just see such a difference, but she felt the difference!  Her normal &amp;#34;next day hair&amp;#34; was not oily and dirty looking at all. The smell lasted and smells great. After about a week of continued use, her hair truly looked healthier. Might i add, we did not use any conditioner with it. I wanted to see how it worked alone, if it would leave her hair soft and shiny. It didn&#x27;t add that super sonic softness that some conditioners do, but her hair isn&#x27;t knotted or hard to brush after using it. I&#x27;m not sure but I think some conditioner brands make her hair seem more oily.  I can&#x27;t wait to see maple holistics make a conditioner or a all in one!&lt;br /&gt;Normally, i would have not purchased this initially on my own, only because I&#x27;ve spent countless amounts of cash on beauty products that don&#x27;t work, or worsens the problem at hand. However-- I&#x27;m so glad that my friend gave this to me! I will definitely be purchasing more when this bottle runs low, now that I know that it does go well with my daughter&#x27;s hair. I can&#x27;t tell you how many useless products we have purchased and wasted.&lt;br /&gt;Would i recommend this?? Yes. I def would, if you have that oily scalp, or your hair tend to be greasy even after a good wash.  I have even used this on my hair, which is very thick, dry, and flat, and it actually gives my hair a healthy feel to it.  It doesn&#x27;t dry ny hair out worse. I love when I find a product that actually does what it says it does!! In today&#x27;s market, most products don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s organic!! That deserves a star by itself!  Although it isn&#x27;t cheap, but being that this product works (at last for or situation &amp; problem) -- it&#x27;s worth every cent! Besides, when you buy cheap, you get cheap.&lt;br /&gt;A+ product!  5 stars!!ch is very thick, dry, and flat, and it actually gives my hair a healthy feel to it.  It doesn&#x27;t dry ny hair out worse. I love when I find a product that actually does what it says it does!! In today&#x27;s market, most products don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s organic!!

    <li> On my clients, this product is the best I have used to date. No drying damage, simply clean scalp!</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo back in the spring. After I had my daughter my once normal hair started acting strange. I was getting so oily it was beginning to look like I stopped showering. After trying every drug store oil control product there was, I was recommended this brand by a friend who works at Lush. She&#x27;s always into the best quick fix for anything hair, makeup, skin related. The price scared me, but honestly it was totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it four stars because I don&#x27;t use it as an every day shampoo and conditioner. I more so use it to &amp;#34;balance&amp;#34; my hair care routine accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed with these products and have recommended them to several friends.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo.  It helps, but not like I had hoped.  I have colored hair, so I don&#x27;t use it all the time.  I will keep using as long as I can find a good conditioner for color treated hair.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo--it works very well.  It takes the oil right out of my hair and keeps it out for at least 2 days and my scalp does not itch after I use this shampoo.  I love the way my hair looks after a good shampoo and this is the product for me.  I have medium length hair and this shampoo does not dry out the ends.  This is the best shampoo I have every found for my very greasy hair and I will keep using it for as long as the company makes it.  Thanks Maple Holistics for this great product.</li>
    <li> My hair is long, dark, and thin. I have to wash my hair everyday because its greasy and itchy by the end of the day. I have used everything drug store and high end products. Nothing worked. This shampoo makes my hair soft, gives me some volume and it feels clean even the second day.  I used a quarter size amount which seems to be enough.  The smell of the shampoo is fresh and light, but it doesn&#x27;t last.  So I just spray and light mist of dry shampoo the next day to give my hair a nice smell. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I tried this product after my mother bought it for herself on the recommendation of a friend.  She has thin, straight hair and had been complaining of her hair&#x27;s oiliness.  This shampoo is definitely on the pricey side but her friend had assured her it was worth it.  She loved it.  It worked better than other shampoos and most importantly the effects lasted longer.  I thought this was particularly impressive because I&#x27;ve always told her her hair looks so amazing the day after she washes it.  Since she &amp;#34;feels dirty&amp;#34; if she doesn&#x27;t wash her hair every day it always looked dry from the constant  hair drying.  But I guess given the option between dry and frizzy or oily she preferred dry.  Now, though, without feeling miserable if she doesn&#x27;t was her hair every single day she gets to enjoy that second- day sexy hair look.&lt;br /&gt;  I have thick curly hair and my main concern is dryness.  Since my mother and I have very different hair types I didn&#x27;t really have any expectations from this product.  I&#x27;m very curious though and if there&#x27;s a new product, i&#x27;m going to give it a try.  I mean we&#x27;re all always on the hunt for the holy grail, right?  and you never know what might become your new favorite beauty product.  Long story short this thing works.  My SCALP feels clean. After using this I now appreciate the difference between having hair that&#x27;s clean and my scalp feeling clean.  It&#x27;s hard to explain but it&#x27;s like drinking Voss water vs all the other bottled waters.  Some people think it&#x27;s silly to choose to spend so much more on something when &amp;#34;they&#x27;re all the same.&amp;#34;  Except they aren&#x27;t are they?&lt;br /&gt;Look, if you&#x27;re even reading the reviews of this product it&#x27;s because you probably already know some shampoo are worth the extra bit of money so the question is &amp;#34;which luxury shampoo do i treat myself to?&amp;#34; A: This one.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband who has very oily hair and itchy scalp.  He&#x27;s tried a variety of product over the years and has only partial success from them. (I&#x27;m writing because I&#x27;m the one whole does this &amp;#34;kind of thing&amp;#34;.)&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s nearing the end of his first bottle (purchased the end of Oct.)  He washes his hair daily, so he&#x27;s had plenty of time to evaluate it.&lt;br /&gt;He is very pleased with this shampoo. So much so that I re-ordered today - in fact I ordered two. It has a clean, herbal scent. Note: It should be shaken before use.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for an excellent product.  I plan to purchase other products from the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo! Ive been looking for the perfect shampoo for my dry hair and this is the one! Smells great as well. Thank you!</li>
    <li> i had my hopes this would work great, however it does not work for me.  I also hate the pine tree smell of it.  I would prefer a better smell for sure.  not very pleased but nice that it is a natural product, just not for me.</li>
    <li> This shampoo definitely works as described. It left my hair feeling very clean and weightless, but most importantly, it was very cleansing for my scalp. I do not use conditioner and I was pleasantly surprised that this shampoo is quite easy to work through the hair and it did not dry out my hair. Be aware that the shampoo does not smell great; it smells like a jumble of mismatched herbs and spices, however the scent definitely does not stay in the hair and the scent is not necessarily unpleasant. Overall, I am very pleased with the product because it does precisely what it says without any toxic ingredients. I was able to see an improvement in the health of my scalp almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest gripe with the product is that it is what I would consider a bit pricey. The bottle is smaller than the typical size of your generic shampoo so I was a bit surprised when I received it in the mail. I think it might be more informative if the size of the bottle were made more explicit in the product description. Because it is a bit pricey, this is not a shampoo that I can reasonably see myself using everyday. Luckily the medicinal effects of the shampoo seems to lasts days after use, but I will probably still alternate between this and another shampoo.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo and I am not a big fan of shampoo as I&#x27;ve always felt they strip and ruin my hair! I decided approximately a year ago to go no poo but it just wasn&#x27;t for me. I then resorted to &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoos found at my local health food stores and they were ok, but nothing to brag about. One day I was browsing for a new shampoo to try here on Amazon and read all of the great reviews left on Maple Holistics shampoo and conditioners. I had to try it and I am so happy I did. I already ordered 2 more bottles. I love this stuff. My hair gets greasy rather quick and this shampoo does an amazing job cleaning it up while leaving my hair soft and manageable at the same time. I will be a returning customer for many years to come!</li>
    <li> I can already tell a difference in my daughters hair!  It is working!</li>
    <li> It has beem so hard to find a shapoo for my dry scalp. I have naturally oily hair, amd everything i have used makes it more oily. This shampoo is just perfect for my hair needs!!!!</li>
    <li> I have dealt with oily &amp; greasy hair my whole life even though I shampoo every day.  I tried this product and I absolutely love it! It works! I no longer have to wash my hair every day!  It leaves my hair looking and smelling great.  TRY IT! I recommend this product</li>
    <li> My daughter is 11 turning 12 in a few months, due to rising hormones and changes her hair which once was wavy and somewhat curly started to straighten out and became very greasy at the roots. I myself have issues with greasy hair, I can blow dry and style my hair and by day two the roots look awful! I usually do one day styled and blown out and day two in a messy bun or pony tail. I found this shampoo while searching amazon for a solution. We talked to hair stylist and ladies at Sally beauty and they all said because it was hormonal there wasn&#x27;t anything to really help. One lady suggested we look for a good quality clarifying shampoo to try. Once we got this in the mail I had my 11 year old use it, she said it smelled pleasant there was no medicinal smell and it foamed up. I am alway but scared of shampoos that dont foam at least a little bit. But once she was finished we towel dried her hair and blew it out. It helped so much! She only put conditioner on the ends and we didnt use any other product and her hair stayed grease free for two days. It was the same for me, I did experience flat and a tiny bit greasy hair on day 3 but that is normal when your hair is dirty and hasn&#x27;t been washed in 3 days. We both have heavy thick hair so someone with thinner lighter hair could very well experience longer duration of grease free hair. I hope to try their dandruff shampoo next, I suffer from seasonal dandruff....So many people has told me once you get rid of dandruff it goes away for good. I only get dandruff in the winter time, the rest of my skin gets dry and itchy also. I never have an issue any other time of the year.</li>
    <li> I have an issue with greasy hair. When I used this product for the first time, it eliminated the greasy feel; however, it left my hair very stiff and course. It may have been the lack of conditioner. Regardless, it smells amazing and will use again!</li>
    <li> i would recommend this product to my friends and family. its a really great product</li>
    <li> This works SO well with my greasy and itchy scalp. My dandruff vanished after only a couple uses!</li>
    <li> I love this product for younger looking and feeling hair! By far the best shampoo I have ever tried. My scalp gets oily so fast and makes my hair flat ,greasy and unattractive. This miraculous product imparts body and shine , and doesn&#x27;t strip my hair color as it is all natural/organic and 100% sulfate free. I have gotten many compliments of how great my hair , looks , feels and smells.  My hair looks it&#x27;s best everyday...... and smells so lovely!</li>
    <li> Works if you use daily!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! I am very sensitive to EVERYTHING! I can only use natural shampoos, conditions, soaps, etc.  Before this shampoo, I would have to wash my hair everyday because of the oil and I would feel so uncomfortable.  But with this shampoo, I now wash my hair every other day and my hair is doing much better: less frizz &amp; less oil.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I have been using this for about a week now. And it seems to be helping. I have tried abut 10 different shampoos in the last few months. And this one seems to be the best so far. I have extremely oily hair in just a few hours after showering. I cannot go a day without washing my hair. And while this hasn&#x27;t completely eliminated the problem it has helped tremendously. My hair is still oily at night but only about half as bad. I see improvement every day I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like the smell of it at first, but the more I use it the more I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves scalp feeling clean, And NOT itchy. Which is a big plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said I have tried several shampoos throughout the last few months and this by far the best. As I read through the description of the product, it had all the qualities I have spent hours trying to find in a shampoo. And so far I haven&#x27;t been disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have extremely oily hair and absolutely have to wash it everyday or I am a greaseball!  I just tried this shampoo for thr first time today and can already tell a dramatic difference! My hair not only feels way cleaner snd less greasy, it is super soft and shiny! I was worried hair would feel dried out after using this product but it actually feels softer and healthier than when I wash with a moisturizing shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After washing I felt a slight tingling sensation on my scalp but this went away after about 30 minutes.  I would definitely recommend shampooing and rinsing twice with this product, as it didnt sud up very much the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who struggles with oily, limp, or flat hair.</li>
    <li> I have oily hair/scalp and this really didn&#x27;t do anything different than any other sulfate-free shampoo. I had hoped it would keep my hair from getting oily for more than a day, but it didn&#x27;t. To keep my hair healthy I try to shampoo every other day, but my hair tends to get greasy on the second day. I don&#x27;t know if this is because my scalp is sweaty or something, but it happens. I had hoped this shampoo would keep my hair less oily on the second day, but it only kept it oil-free for the same day I shampooed.</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair. It gets pretty weighed down by most shampoos and conditioners. I googled &amp;#34;shampoo for greasy hair&amp;#34; and found this product. I really like it so far! I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my hair looking nice. It feels soft and silky too.</li>
    <li> First of all, I have the most greasy hair ever. I have tried countless different clarifying shampoos and none of them work as well as this. I could wash my hair at night before I went to bed and wake up looking like I haven&#x27;t showered in days. When I first used this shampoo my hair looked cleaner and healthier than it had in months. My hair was no longer greasy and now I can even go two days without showering and still not have any grease. This stuff is like a miracle. I cannot be more satisfied with this shampoo and highly recommend it for anyone with greasy hair.</li>
    <li> Omg I can&#x27;t believe this thing it work like fire .this product is so amazing I am out of words</li>
    <li> So for those just like me, searching for a solution to your greasy scalp and exploring some solutions other than 5 dollors shampoo, this is really a worth-trying one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve finished a whole bottle of this shampoo before I&#x27;m here writing this review:&lt;br /&gt;--When I first open it, it smells like mixture of some natural herbal thing. Pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;--At the very first time I applied this shampoo to my hair, it feels like it&#x27;s absorbing all the grease on my scalp and made my hair and scalp so clean as I can never imagine. This kind of make my hair too dry that I&#x27;ve encountered some trouble combing it. **Remember to massage your scalp when you apply the shampoo. **&lt;br /&gt;--A couple of weeks passed, now my hair is INDEED LESS GREASY, WOW! I believe tangle is never a problem for greasy scalp, but having our hair looks nice a whole day long has puzzled me up for a really long while. Now this shampoo really helps me resolve that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I gave it 4 star is because the price is really high compared to its size. When I received my package, I was literarily stunned by it&#x27;s size.</li>
    <li> I have been dealing with an itchy scalp and greasy hair with dandruff/flaking for almost eight years now. Everything I&#x27;ve ever tried in the past hasn&#x27;t worked. I found this shampoo and saw that it was the only one that works for both greasy hair and an itchy scalp. I purchased the Degrease shampoo hoping that this would finally be the one that would solve all my hair and scalp problems. But it wasn&#x27;t. The thing is, this shampoo is called &amp;#34;Degrease&amp;#34; and it does that job very well. Normally the next day after I wash my hair, my scalp and hair already start to feel greasy but ever since using this product, my hair has noticeably been less greasy. I thought that this would help my flaking and itchy scalp problems, but it hasn&#x27;t. I still see a lot of flakes in my hair and scalp, they still get all over my shirt, and while it minimized the itching, I still get an intense urge to scratch my scalp. While I am thankful that it got rid of the greasiness, I&#x27;m still left with lots of dandruff and a very itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> I have fine straight hair. It made my hair dry on the ends and didn&#x27;t really help my scalp. After a few weeks of using this it made my scalp itch more.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for my thin and oily hair. It is a very good product. I have tried multiple products from professional series but, this product fits the best for my needs.</li>
    <li> I previously bought the Sage shampoo and liked that quite a bit. I suffer from &#x27;smelly hair syndrome&#x27; and that seemed to control that funky smell. I decided to give this one a shot. Although I like the smell, it does nothing for the grease in my hair. I&#x27;ll shower at night and wake up with my hair greasy. I do like that the ingredients are natural.</li>
    <li> Some frame of reference for this review: I bought this shampoo because I was looking for a new product to try and I typically buy shampoos that use natural ingredients, but am no expert in this market.  I usually wash my hair every 1-2 days.  My hair tends to get a little oily on the second day after washing in the winter time and on the third day after washing in the summer time.  I occasionally get dandruff and an itchy scalp, so I don’t think my scalp is the healthiest of scalps that one can have.  My hair is not colored or permed.  Shampooing phase: The shampoo smells like a mixture of mint and rosemary.  After the wash, it left my hair smelling rather neutral.  I followed the directions on the bottle and use a quarter-sized dollop of shampoo which lathered more than thoroughly into my hair (which is medium length) and scalp.  I let it sit for 2-3 minutes and my scalp started feeling refreshed in a minty way.  My hair felt clean after the shampooing.  And I conditioned the ends of my hair, using a different-branded product.  Day 1 after Shampooing phase: As expected, my hair usually is not greasy the day after shampooing.  My hair and scalp doesn’t feel different from normal.  Day 2 after Shampooing phase: My hair felt clean in the morning but by the end of the day it felt oily enough to feel necessary to wash.  All in all, the shampoo doesn’t seem to be anything special to me after first use.  I would have given it 4 stars but deducted one star for its high price relative to the amount of shampoo received.  I will update this review after having gone through the whole bottle, with whether I have a sense that this shampoo has had some longer term benefits for my hair and scalp.  Perhaps results will change.  UPDATE (5/3/2015) - I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo everyday to every other day for the past couple months and have seen no results in how oily my hair gets after a day.  If anything, I would say that my hair gets greasy more quickly than usual where I&#x27;vebeen relegated to washing my hair everyday since using this shampoo regularly.</li>
    <li> I just received the bottle and I have no issues with the packaging. In good condition with no broken bottle. I like the fact that writing this review provides me a free bottle, I think that&#x27;s good customer service and considering the bottle is pretty small given the price, I believe three months will better determine whether or not I find it effective. I will return to complete the review after I use the shampoo for three months. As of yet, I have fine black hair that has never been colored and rarely blow-dried. My hair is medium length with few split ends but my scalp is often itchy if I don&#x27;t wash after a day. I want to go sulfate free and see if I can shampoo less and still have a clean scalp. I &#x27;m hoping this shampoo will do the trick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve transitioned from one shampoo to another for a long time, until now. Previous shampoos have left my scalp feeling dry--if not immediately then after a few hours. Using this shampoo, not only do I feel that my hair is clean (squeaky clean!), but the clean feeling lasts just about a whole day (until my next shower). Also, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair is more shiny and alive, too, after using this for a few weeks. Previously, my hair always looked pale and dry after my shower, but with this, it gleans in the light. I&#x27;ll be sticking to this shampoo for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;m slightly disappointed about is the size of this bottle--it&#x27;s small! I wish there&#x27;s a bigger size that I can simply order and use for a long time, but that&#x27;s a business decision for them to work out.</li>
    <li> I bought the degrease  shampoo over a month now. In the first week and like another shampoo, but after that my hair looks so much better, the itching is still there but not like before and I am able to wash my hair every 2 days sometimes every 3. The best part for me is the smell............the other shampoos I tried did not have a pleasant smell, I recommend this one, you need to try.</li>
    <li> My mom bought this for me as part of a birthday present, I had never heard of this brand but I am really pleased with how it makes my hair feel and look. I have really oily and greasy hair, I don&#x27;t like to wash my hair every day but I have to because it looks disgusting if I don&#x27;t. When I use this shampoo I can actually have nice second day hair without it looking TOO greasy. It might just be my hair type but I still had a little shine in the morning but with a little dry shampoo everything was a-okay. I&#x27;m going to have to make this shampoo a staple!</li>
    <li> This shampoo has done nothing but make my hair tangly, dry, and hard. After using it for a few weeks, I see no positive results. The oil and itching are exactly the same, if not worse. Only now, after showering, my hair is a rock-hard mass of tangles. I was forced to start conditioning the ends every single day so I could simply get a comb through my hair. This shampoo seems to have an extreme drying effect on my scalp, and if anything, my scalp is producing MORE oil now. The shampoo is also very difficult to lather. Hardly any suds. It feels like I&#x27;m not using shampoo at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT worth the money. I had high hopes, given the reviews, but this product just does not work for my hair/scalp.</li>
    <li> Did not make any difference</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost a month now and am really enjoying it. My hair is noticeably less oily and my scalp itching has improved. This is my new go to shampoo.</li>
    <li> It works ok, but nothing miraculous, and the scent is quite overpowering and not entirely pleasant.</li>
    <li> Not real happy with it. When I use it, I get little pimply bumps on my scalp. They get really sore when they pop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Husband doesn&#x27;t like it either. His scalp has problems when he uses it, too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had oily hair. This shampoo doesn&#x27;t help at all with oily scalp  and my hair feel like straw. My scalp is itching and all over it are painful, red bumps. The smell is very bad I can’t stand it.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo for people who struggle with oily hair. I have been purchasing one brand after another in an effort to find some success and have always found that the shampoos came up short. Degrease by Maple Holistics is as close to perfection as I have found. That is not to say that there is not another shampoo for oily hair that might out-perform it but I certainly have not found it. Degreaser cleans very well but also leaves my hair feeling extremely healthy. In fact, my hair is feeling &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34; than it has for many years. It looks great!  I am lucky that I haven&#x27;t ever suffered from flaking/dandruff and Degreaser did not cause any side effects like that. Overall, I am quite impressed with this shampoo and would recommend it to anyone who suffers from oily hair!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this is another oily hair shampoo that doesn&#x27;t do a thing for my hair. Smells good though.</li>
    <li> This product work to reduce greasiness of my scalp.  It lathers very nicely, and an 8 oz bottle last about 4+ months.  I just ordered another one.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with greasy hair for a long time, I often found myself throwing on a baseball cap. When I did some research on the internet many sites recommended baking soda and avoid washing your hair every day (I hate that feeling), these options seemed very time consuming and messy. I was very surprised when I came across this shampoo, I would of never thought a product like this was available. I have been using this for a week now and I cannot believe the results! My hair has more volume, no flakes, and never looks greasy. This was the best $20 I have spent in a long time! Thanks for this amazing product, I can&#x27;t wait to try some of your other items.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect product if you want to keep your hair healthy. My scalp is extremely itchy by day 3 (after wash), with this product I can extend the style to 5 days. Very gentle, worth the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a real problem with very oily scalp for years and have tried just about everything.  Most shampoos formulated for this problem are very harsh and cannot be used every time I wash my hair.....not to mention the extreme eye burning they cause.  I get my hair colored, so that also has adverse effects there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product for a month now, and it is absolutely fantastic!!!!  My scalp is clear and does not itch anymore.  The color in my hair has lasted longer than it ever has....and it doesn&#x27;t burn at all!!!  Don&#x27;t even hesitate......I bought 6 bottles at one time and am glad I did.  I am a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; customer living in Florida and have NO CONNECTION to this company whatsoever.  I have only left one other review ever, and I do alot of online shopping.  Do yourself a favor and just try this shampoo......you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had greasy hair all my life... Believe me when I say if there is one shampoo that works best for degreasing , it&#x27;s this one. Before I had to wash my hair everyday but now I am washing it every other day even though there is no sign of grease in my hair... More power to the people behind this awesome shampoo ! Thank you.</li>
    <li> Loved this product but i had to stop buying it because it is simply too expensive for just a small bottle. Would buy again if it was a bigger size for the same price</li>
    <li> this is a good product for oily hair. I&#x27;ve been using it in-between my normal shampoo and it seems to keep the grease at bay.</li>
    <li> It works great..I have had oily hair since I had my child I have used everything that you can imagine at Wal-Mart nothing works I teyes this in weeks I saw a difference in my hair beeing more shinny and less oil and itchy I would recommend this to anyone who has oil hair</li>
    <li> I have had oily hair in the last 5 years or so and always had to wash my hair every second day. I have a collection of many different shampoos, both cheap and expensive, but none of them have helped. Most of them worked fine in a week or so, then gave me terrible dandruff afterwards, so I had to stop using them. I have used Degrease in 3 weeks time and wash my hair every 3-4 days. It works great. The first 2 days after wash my hair always looked oily-free (perfect!) though from Day 3 and Day 4 look greasy again but I hope it will be better and better. I also tried staying away from the fatty, greasy food as much as I can. Both Degrease and the poor fat diet seem to help. As important as degreasing, there is no itch nor sign of dandruff. Thanks a lot Maple Holistics. My last concern is whether it is a permanent/temporary solution. Only time can answer that. But in the mean time I am very happy with Degrease.  Update 10 days  after my original review on 22 Feb. 2015 :  I started feeling itchy during the last week and the unwelcome dandruff has already shown up. Degrease was good in the first 3 weeks but it is still not yet my solution. I am actually quite sad since I thought I could find my dream organic shampoo.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I had very oily hair. I woke up with it everyday feeling turned off. Use this product if you do not want to shower daily and waste time!</li>
    <li> I have oily roots, dry ends, and dyed red hair.  I decided to try this shampoo in the hopes that it would balance out the oil at my roots so I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair every day, and because it&#x27;s sulfate free.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  The first few washes dried out the rest of my hair too much, but when I added the Silk 18 conditioner to the routine, I&#x27;m getting hydrated ends, and no oily roots.  I can go three days without washing my hair, and my color hasn&#x27;t faded noticeably. If you do have dry hair with oily roots, make sure you don&#x27;t add the conditioner to the roots, it will sink in and undo all the good.</li>
    <li> I am currently pregnant, and the pregnancy has taken a toll on my hair, making it flat and greasy even right after i wash it.  This product does a fantastic job making my hair look clean and healthy again.  The only reason why I deducted a star is because, to me at least, the shampoo smells like pine trees, and i am not to fond of the smell.  Other than that though, this shampoo is great!</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that this shampoo is the best! I have naturally oily hair and skin, but this product really improved my hair. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel heavy and dull like other shampoos I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m happy with this product and will most likely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Just started using this shampoo and already love it!  Smells great, and only a little bit needed with each use.  The directions say to use a quarter-sized amount, let it soak in for two to three minutes, rinse, then repeat.  It left my hair feeling lighter, fuller, and super clean.  Very satisfied, will definitely be ordering again.</li>
    <li> For the past year or so since I moved I have been struggling with very greasy skin and hair. I tried getting a water filter for my shower head(which did help some), using volumizing shampoo to lift the hair away from my face( not successfull at all), a moisturizing shampoo -thinking it was because I was stripping all the oil off my scalp and causing it to over produce( made it worse), tried two different clarifying shampoos, tried rinsing with vinegar, I even used Dawn dish soap as a last resort. I spent hours researching different causes and different tricks and I tried them all. I currently have a full grocery bag of shampoo that have only been halfway used. I was starting to really get frustrated when I finally thought... Hey the essential oils that I&#x27;ve been using for the past couple of months have really helped with the oil on my face, I bet there is an essential oil shampoo out there that would help my hair too! So I started my research first searching essential oil shampoos then natural shampoos and Maple Holistics kept showing up. So I order it. Heck, I&#x27;d tried everything else.&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy with how quickly it arrived. Only a few days wait time! It even comes with a brochure and little card with information about the main ingredients and what it does. On the back of the card are &amp;#34;showering tips&amp;#34;. Finish with cold water, massage the scalp after shampooing and wait 5-10 minutes before blow drying. I also followed the wash your hair, leave on for several minutes, rinse then repeat. So basically, I wash round one, shave under my arms, rinse, wash round two, shave my legs then rinse the final time. I&#x27;ve been experimenting with which round matters most, and I believe leaving the shampoo in longer during the second round gives the best results.I followed the recommendation to wait before blow drying but I just couldn&#x27;t bring my self to rinse with cold water...at first. Day one my hair was so fluffy and soft but it didn&#x27;t do much for the stringy, greasy pieces around my face. Week one went by with gradual improvements, each day a little better than the day before. Still results are so much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. I am currently a few days from two full weeks and in the last couple days I finally started doing the final rinse with cool water. This is the ticket!!! As soon as I tried it I saw the best results so far. I am very happy with the Degreaser shampoo and definitely recommend it for anyone who is struggling with greasy, stringy hair</li>
    <li> For an all natural shampoo, it does fight against scalp itching for men.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for oily/greasy hair. My hair really looks clean and stays clean after use. I would shower at night and my hair would honestly be greasy in the morning; not anymore! I also got it because I thought it would help with the itching I have at a spot in the back of my head, but no such luck and I have been using it regularly for over a month now. I think it&#x27;s a great product for those with greasy hair though. I have to use a good conditioner afterwards.. it leaves the hair knotted and tangled after use but definitely worth it. My hair is soft and shiny all day, feels light and looks amazing. I would recommend for anyone with greasy hair! I even think my hair has been growing faster!</li>
    <li> Made my hair worse; more greasy and dandruff appeared!</li>
    <li> I love these products.  All natural ingredients and sulfate free, but still gets satisfyingly foamy when applied.  My hair is noticeably softer and my scalp no longer itches!</li>
    <li> I have very long hair. I started changing up my shampoos because I was starting to get build up with a shampoo I had used for years. I tried natural shampoos, no poo, Aveda (some I really liked, but cringed at $40 for a tiny bottle), Paul Mitchell, all the organic shampoos at the store - my scalp just started hating me. I was at my wits end with either greasy hair, dry hair, brittle hair, dandruff, becoming The Frizz or itchy scalp; many times it was a combination of them. I have now been using this shampoo for three weeks and my hair is super soft with no build up, no grease, no itchy scalp, no dandruff, The Frizz is under control and I can go a day between washing my hair without becoming the Fonz or the Frizz. I love this shampoo! (Enough to write a review - which I NEVER bother to take the time to do)</li>
    <li> My son has oily hair and this stuff works well. He&#x27;s a preteen.</li>
    <li> So, I did not expect this to work. I have straight blonde hair (but a lot of it) that gets oily fast. Some people say that oily hair is a misconception, but I definitely have oily hair, no matter how well I wash it.  Before I found this, I was using another brand of all natural shampoo. Even though it made my hair soft and smell good, it did not help with my greasiness and it made my hair flat; I thought I couldn&#x27;t do anything about it. But I decided to try this after all of the positive reviews. I&#x27;m happy to say that I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair every day. I can wash it every other day, and even then it&#x27;s nowhere near as greasy as it was before. I was afraid this would make it too dry but that&#x27;s definitely not the case. It even lathers extremely well, unlike most all natural shampoos, so I don&#x27;t need to use a ton of it. Thankfully, it also gives my hair much more body- it doesn&#x27;t even look flat on the second day. And it smells like a lemony pine tree.  I&#x27;m happy my research for all natural shampoos finally paid off. Now I&#x27;m going to get my sister a bottle.</li>
    <li> Past few years I have had problems with head sweating, sores that never go 100 percent away and head has bad greasy build up. And I mean Greasy not oil. We looked in stores and did not find much hair shampoo for oil hair let alone greasy . I am glad for the couple different types from Amazon I have tried and like.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with oily hair for years. I tried this product and love it! It really does a great job.</li>
    <li> My scalp was itching me so bad so I thought id take to the internet it find a cure. I found this shampoo and I have been extremely happy with it. My scalp feels healthy and my hair looks great!</li>
    <li> I really like this product! i would recommend this product hands down. I&#x27;m a 17 year old girl who struggles with oily hair.. i wash my hair every day and when it drys, it still manages to be oily. I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun; buying expensive shampoo from my salon, trying to wash my hair with cold water, deep conditionings etc. My hair has never felt so clean with Maple Holistic. Yes, my hair does somedays feel a little oily after using this product (maybe hormonal), but typically my hair is oil free. DEFINITELY try this product.. whats the harm?</li>
    <li> Never thought about using this type of product. I always bought anything that has anti stuff for psoriasis thing from local supermarket.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing works at all in last few years, I couldn&#x27;t find anything that works for me.&lt;br /&gt;Before the Christmas, I searched online then found this luckily, price is fair to me. I ordered right away, and received timely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used once as regular shampoo, and used hair dryer to get my hair dried.&lt;br /&gt;I could feel my scalp and hair is deep cleaned. I could feel it&#x27;s natural stuff.&lt;br /&gt;It does not effect anything other than cleaning scalp and hair.&lt;br /&gt;Before using this shampoo, I often get bad smells from my hair and it&#x27;s coming from the oily scalp as known. but after using this shampoo, it&#x27;s completely gone, It works perfectly for me at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to use hair dryer to get better hair condition, If I don&#x27;t use the hair dryer then the hair gets very stiff. It&#x27;s depending on its hair condition.&lt;br /&gt;Without any result, it still worth to use it as regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> My daughter has extremely oily hair and I tried everything I knew to do and even tried many shampoos. This smells fabulous and she loves this shampoo! It also came with tips to help with her with her oily hair. This works!! And I love the fact that it is natural!</li>
    <li> I have very fine, shoulder length hair with dry ends but an oily scalp. I can wash my hair in the morning, and by the end of the day, my bangs look greasy. Dry shampoo has helped to a point, but a lot of them seem to dull my hair or leave a scent that I don&#x27;t like. I also feel like that just covers up the issue. I saw the great reviews for this on Amazon and decided to give it a try. It is truly awesome---my hair did not greasy at all throughout the day and kept its volume! The scent of it reminds me of pine. If it bothers you, it doesn&#x27;t really stay in the hair. I kind of like it. I will be purchasing this again. I highly suggest trying it out and making sure to follow the instructions on the bottle.  If you have the same issue as me where your ends are very dry, you can just shampoo your scalp and then only place conditioner on the ends. This has really helped the issue for me.</li>
    <li> i love this product! really helps my hair alot! i tend to have greasy hair and it keeps it shiny clean!</li>
    <li> I used to have really greasy hair. If I wash it in the morning and want to go out later in the evening chances are I have to rewash it. Such a pain. This product has simplified my life. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> After I gave birth, my hair became inexplicably greasy.  I tried a number of cheaper drugstore options, but this shampoo has been the only thing that has helped get my hair back to normal.  I&#x27;m now able to go much longer between shampoos and my hair seems stronger and healthier.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> As someone with fairly oily hair, I&#x27;m always on the hunt for the latest and greatest thing that will help me deal with the greasy scalp issues and still keep my hair nourished and healthy. I switched to an all natural regimen a few years ago as I think it really helps with the purity and overall quality of my hair. This shampoo smells delightful, and it really does an amazing job getting rid of any greasiness or oily spots but my hair still feels tremendously healthy and shiny. My strands are soft yet not to the point of having buildup like they would before. I would really reccommend this to anyone in need of getting rid of greasy follicles once and for all!</li>
    <li> My hair is always greasy and itchy one day after washing and this shampoo helps so much and the scent is very nice. I swear by this stuff. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using any other brands.</li>
    <li> I have (had)  extremely itchy dry scalp for years.  Until I found this product, know thought I was destined to live with it for the rest of my life.  After using this product for a little over a month I have noticed a drastic change. My hair is more healthy not itchy and has a bounce.  I love this stuff</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about a week now and am loving it.  I have been searching for a good, natural shampoo for several years and was unsuccessful until I found this product on amazon.  A small amount is all you need as it goes a long way, and I am finding that I don&#x27;t need to shampoo daily as with the other products I have used.  I&#x27;m purchasing the conditioner as well for my dry ends.</li>
    <li> I have oily hair and I used to have to wash my hair everyday just in order to keep it looking clean. I started using baking soda with apple cider vinegar, because I wanted to go chemical free and I had a few friends who suggested it to me. The baking soda worked well in keeping my hair looking clean for a couple for days in a row without having to wash it again. But shortly after switching over, I noticed my hair started to look dried out and I had some damaged spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received some Degrease Shampoo as a gift and as soon as I started using it I noticed a difference. My hair felt soft after the first use and I can go four or five day without washing it again. That&#x27;s probably my favorite part about this product! It is so nice to not have to wash my hair everyday. And because you only need about a quarter sized amount per washing, the bottle lasts me for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who has oily hair and has struggled with what to use or how to wash it. I am amazed at the difference I&#x27;ve see in my own experience and would hope that it works just as well for others.</li>
    <li> Not really seeing a difference</li>
    <li> I love it and i and still using i love how it made my hair fell i have very dry scalp and this made it fell so much better I just cant wait to take a shower and use this product</li>
    <li> This hair product is a must in your weekly routine. I don&#x27;t use it every day but certainly when my scalp is becoming greasy. I have thick hair and it is the only thing that works. Try it!</li>
    <li> My son mixes this with the sage heavy dandruff shampoo. He has eliminated the dandruff plus his hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy after a few hours after shampooing.</li>
    <li> While it did degrease my hair, my scalp was still itchy. My scalp is dandruff prone with oily roots especially the bangs at the end of the day. I would buy this again if it was cheaper, for now, I will continue to look around</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product. My daughter&#x27;s hair was always greasy and we tried every de-grease shampoo on the market. Finally, I found this one and my daughters hair hasn&#x27;t been greasy since. WE LOVE MAPLE HOLISTICS!!!</li>
    <li> works really great with natural ingredients and smells great too love the price and value of them size is great too leave my hair shiny and not greasy long lasting and great</li>
    <li> this shampoo made my hair squeaky clean :)  i really like it. it has a really nice lemon scent to it. i didnt expect the bottle to be so tiny but i think its still very worth buying. i&#x27;ve only used it once so far and i already like it very much! my hair is way less oily than it was b4 after a day at school ^^ . will definitely be buying in the future.</li>
    <li> I have tried multiple i mean multiple!! products for my greasy scalp due to a lot of sebum secretion.&lt;br /&gt;I always wanted something that has argon oil, sulfate free and have been using pudora for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;it was good product however it did not control sebum somewhat so i switched to degrease and so far result is good.&lt;br /&gt;i wash my hair in the morning and I tapped my scalp after few hours and much less sebum and i loved it.&lt;br /&gt;aroma of shampoo is good and it lathers well.&lt;br /&gt;so far i recommend this product to those out there with oily scalp.</li>
    <li> Love this. It keeps the fresh look. And it&#x27;s so gentle.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended I try this out. I&#x27;ve used so many different products with my hair. I have a disorder that weakens a lot of things including my hair so when I found that this product eased the dry and itch almost immediately I haven&#x27;t switched since. This is amazing and it&#x27;s rare to find something so natural that I like and can use over and over. So glad it&#x27;s helped my hair is a lot stronger and feels better</li>
    <li> I have been using shampoos and conditioners such Herbal Essences and Pantene for years. I could never understand why my hair would get so greasy so fast. Literally would have to wash once sometimes twice a day. I didn&#x27;t think that was normal. After talking with my sister in law (a hair dresser) I realized it was the shampoo I was using. I decided to try Maple Holistics Shampoo for Oily, Itchy &amp; Greasy Hair and it has done wonders. The product does exactly what it says it does. I also like the fact that it is all natural and made in the US. I don&#x27;t mind the price either. I think it is worth it!</li>
    <li> In the past few months, my scalp randomly became really oily, itchy, flaky and slightly red. I started losing hair because of how much oil and flaking there was. This condition was identified as seborrheic dermatitis. I tried Nizoral, T-Gel coal tar shampoo, and regular dandruff shampoos, but nothing really helped stop the flaking or the itchiness. I started looking for more natural solutions. I tried Nature Gate Tea Tree Shampoo and that didn’t really help either. Then I came across this Degrease shampoo. It seemed to target the main issue of my problems: excess oil. I tried it out and it definitely did relieve some of the itching and oil. The amount of dandruff I had went down as well. However, after using it consistently (every other day at the least) for 6-7 weeks now, it still hasn’t fixed any of my problems. My scalp still gets oily after a day and there is still flaking, redness, and itchiness. I was really hoping this would solve my problem and stop the hair loss as well that was resulting due to the excess oil. Even though it hasn’t worked to the extent I would have hoped, it still has helped the most out of any shampoo I’ve tried. I’m still hoping that given more time the Degrease shampoo will help more, but I think I am going to try their Sage Shampoo which is supposedly the recommended shampoo for seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
    <li> My mom purchased this for me after years of struggling with oily hair due to PCOS. I have to admit, I giggled at the name, but it is straight and to the point! I have noticed a big difference in my hair in so many ways. I guess my hair was so bogged down with oil and build up from other shampoos, that this just feels like a miracle shampoo! I usually use twice and follow the directions, leaving it in 3 minutes at a time. First application never seems to penetrate as much as I&#x27;d like, but the second one?! Holy lather heaven! My hair is really dry-feeling before blow drying, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I brush from tips to roots, which minimizes tangles (but I&#x27;ve always been tangle-prone)! My hands also feel a little bit dry after using, but I do not care, there is lotion for that!...it is solving my horribly oily hair (usually need to wash twice a day to not feel grossed out by the oil)... and after a blow dry my hair not only feels amazing, but is very soft and seems to have a fuller look! I also feel like I ALWAYS have to straighten my hair...but with this product, it does something to my hair that allows me to go without straightening it. Miracle shampoo!</li>
    <li> It is a good shampoo. It helped me clean my hair of grease from waxing and mousse.</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy hair that gets oily after a day, and massively itchy/flaky by day two (basically homebound until I wash my hair). I followed the directions on this shampoo carefully (massage in, leave on, rinse, AND repeat) without changing anything else about my routine, and after a week I noticed my hair wasn&#x27;t itching like crazy on the second day without washing, and didn&#x27;t have the subsequent flaking. My scalp is still very oily, but as long as the itching is under control, I can get by with dry shampoo and messy updos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I think most of the efficacy of this product is shampooing twice, which I never did before. After a week of using Degrease, I decided that for the price, it was way too much to use twice per shower, so currently I shampoo first with Trader Joe&#x27;s Tea Tree Tingle shampoo (which is probably the second best sulfate-free &#x27;poo after Degrease), and then shampoo a second time with Degrease. Sometimes I use other shampoos and I notice that my itch is back, so I know Degrease is working after all. My hair does feel squeaky clean, and it lathers well for being sulfate-free. It smells like a woodsy lemon, but I usually can&#x27;t smell it by the time I rinse the conditioner out.</li>
    <li> I do not like this shampoo, way too expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros, it works for one day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons: doesn&#x27;t smell that great.  If my hair gets wet from the rain, I can smell the shampoo and it isn&#x27;t that flattering.&lt;br /&gt;way too much money for the fact that it doesn&#x27;t work for my hair which is thin oily blonde hair</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what stated. Cleans no differently than regular shampoos and still have to wash hair every single day way to pricey for lack of usefulness. wont order again.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell as floral or as girly as conventional shampoos, but it doesn&#x27;t smell offensive, either. It smells like herbs and has a fresh scent. Also, it does a really good job of keeping my scalp and hair grease and oil free. It used to be a big problem of mine, but not anymore.</li>
    <li> Gerat Shampoo for oily scalp buildup.  No sulfates!  All natural.  Replaces the harshness in Selsun Blue and Head &amp;amp; Shoulders products. One of the few products that actually don&#x27;t cause reactions on my sensitive scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LP, Massachusetts</li>
    <li> Product works great on oily hair and flaking scalp. Company is always diligent in making sure cap is taped secure!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo.  Does not over dry your hair.  Nice fragrance.  Use it daily</li>
    <li> I absolutely love natural products so this is great for me. I attempted to make a shampoo similar to this before and it didn&#x27;t come out nearly as nice, with as nice a lather or clean feeling as with this shampoo. This product does make my hair feel nice and does degrease my hair although I still have to wash my hair at latest every other day. Its really pricey as most natural products seem to be, so I expect to pay for quality. I enjoy using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I noticed after my first shampoo that my hair was less oily and more manageable. It smells yummy too! A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I would say this product does help control my daughter&#x27;s greasy hair, but her hair is still kind of greasy by the afternoon.  It smells nice and lathers well though.  It also shipped really quickly.  It&#x27;s a nice product, but I wish it worked a little better.  It&#x27;s quite expensive for how little you get.</li>
    <li> this product did nothing for my hair..Went one day without washing my hair and my hair was like a grease ball..for all the money you pay for a quality product I was very disappointed..</li>
    <li> I have oily hair, and a dry scalp. Additionally, I have thick, fine hair. (The individual hairs are ultra thin, but I have a lot of them.) This shampoo is great; it smells great, it does not dry out my hair or scalp, and the oiliness has significantly decreased! I will continue to buy this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 17 yrs. old and I have had greasy hair all my life until I used this shampoo. I used to feel frustrated &amp; had a lack of confidence because of my unruly, greasy hair. In the past I had used a lot of different types of expensive shampoos &amp; nothing ever worked. I thought I was going to have to deal with this problem all my life until I came across this shampoo. My Mom said to give this shampoo a try &amp; to give it a couple weeks, but I noticed a difference the first time! I was so excited to go out in public and show off my new mane!  I feel more confident now and thankful my Mom stumbled across this amazing product! I&#x27;m a customer for life! :)</li>
    <li> After using this for a week, I was able to clean my hair thoroughly unlike when I use the other brands. I was able to heal my itchiness and the wounds made scratching my scalp. This does not irritate the wounds and cleans the scalp very well to remove itchiness and dandruff. The shampoo is perfect for people suffering super itchy hair and has scratched the itch. causing it to wound.</li>
    <li> My scalp has a tendency to get greasy.  This product definitely eliminates this problem.  The only draw back, it makes my curly hair a little dry, so I alternate it with another moisturizing shampoo.</li>
    <li> I really love this shampoo, it made my hair soft and shiny (I used in conjunction with their conditioner). I noticed a lot less hair in the drain :) I have waist length, thick hair so the difference is noticeable. My head stopped itching and feeling greasy after a day.I use the shampoo only on the scalp, and conditioner only the ends. Wish the bottle was bigger though and I couldn&#x27;t find an ounce size in the description or the packaging.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend has been using their shampoo for dandruff and it has done wonders on her hair, so I decided to give this one a try. I was hesitant because almost all degreasing shampoos do not work. They over-dry my hair, which sparks my head to go into massive production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo surprised me. A lot. It doesn&#x27;t over dry my scalp. It also doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking like I never showered.</li>
    <li> Not for me, unfortunately</li>
    <li> I was once a 26 year old girl that had  to religiously shampoo her hair daily (sometimes even twice) and pony tail it by 5pm. Now I am a 26 year old girl with softer, lighter, healthier, and more voluminous hair. Not to mention it smells great and it&#x27;s still not greasy even after 48 hours! I wish I would have found this shampoo sooner! I could see and feel the difference before I even got out of the shower the first time I used it. The only downside is that my hair is a little more frizzy than it once was after blow drying. None the less I give it five stars!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;m one of these people that it made it worse for my already very oily scalp and hair. I washed in the morning and within 6 hr my hair looked like i did not washed for day or two :(  I have very oily scalp and skin (it is plus for skin.. less wrinkles..) but scalp and hair suffers,I wash everyday and I know that eating many carbs/sweets and washing/touching very often makes hair even greaser. I try avoid doing those things, but no way I can allow my long hair go without wash... and its not that look bothers  me, i have option with long hair to change styles,but itchiness and feeling of dirty hair is just not pleasant.  In any case i gave try 4-5 times daily( no way i would go without wash with this shampoo) but made it worse for my oily scalp.  Back to searching.. I already used so many different clarifying  shampoos....ugh  .. for the price and natural product Im sad it did not worked. its sucked :(</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!! It works on me. I have itchy and oily scalp and I am doing better after using this product. I highly recommend it! I am so happy with my new shampoo. :-)</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! it&#x27;s been months that i have struggled with greasy hair, i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of the cold season or some hormonal imbalance, but none of the products that i used seemed to help. I was getting frustrated because i had to wash my hair every day, and i&#x27;m a stay home mom, with a two month old baby, so i really don&#x27;t have that much time for myself. This shampoo is awesome! i haven&#x27;t felt my hair so clean, silky and shiny, in a very long time.I also like its scent, so fresh and natural. It&#x27;s a little bit pricey for me (i have never spent so much on a shampoo before :)), and i wish i could find it in stores and not have to order it online (again - lack of time), so that&#x27;s why i&#x27;m giving it 4 stars, but other than that it&#x27;s a great product and I would definitely recommend it to someone who has this problem.</li>
    <li> I have very oily hair and this product has made a world of difference to my hair plus dry shampoo of course. The hair washing has diminished to 2 times per week where before it was everyday</li>
    <li> I got a tip. That is to use this but use soap on your hair before shampooing it.</li>
    <li> First of all, it smells great! I&#x27;ve been using store brand shampoo for many years now and developed some scalp buildup... But this product seems to be great in solving that problem! It is a bit expensive for its size, but the product is worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to try other shampoos from this company - their shampoos/conditioners seem to be very natural and organic.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! I have sort of fine, thinner hair that I always have to wash or it gets super greasy. ever since I started using this shampoo, I can actually go a full other day without washing my hair and it isn&#x27;t flat and stuck to my scalp! I definitely reccomend it. I actually mix it with my Pantene shampoo... :)</li>
    <li> Purchased for a family member that has fine hair. By midafternoon it would get a greasy clumped together look to it. We tried many many different brands of shampoo for oily and fine hair but nothing worked very well. She has used it for 3 days now and the results are very promising. Each day is better than the day before and today her hair still looks pretty clean well into the evening. It&#x27;s a costly product but if it continues as it has, it will be worth the expense. It would be nice if it was available locally and in a larger size.</li>
    <li> This does nothing to my hair and scalp. I wash my hair daily because my scalp feels greasy by the end of the day. After using this product, I feel it does nothing to my scalp, in fact I think my hair looks greasier. Also the volume of this product is fairly small, for the price, it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
    <li> Finally a shampoo for oily scalp... that works!&lt;br /&gt;After 3 days, my scalp feels refreshed and overall lighter. I hope that it will still feel this way months and months to come. Will update my review then!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my son who has extremely oily and greasy hair and this product delivers what it promises.  However with washing his hair each day, it seems to dry out his hair. I contacted Maple Holistics and they send him a free full size bottle of the silk 18 conditioner.  I am impressed with the product and the customer service. I highly recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and I LOVE IT! I have struggled with oily hair my entire life and had to wash my hair every single day....UNTIL NOW! I haven&#x27;t washed my hair in 3 days and it still looks good! I wish this product was cheaper, but I am going to continue to buy it because it&#x27;s working so well to solve my oily hair problem! Buy this if you struggle with oil, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> very satisfied with the product, price, service and timing</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo because a tiny bit goes a very long way. But I find that it leaves my hair so silky and soft that I can&#x27;t manage it well. Too many fly-aways.. I also found that, while it improved the itching, it hasn&#x27;t stopped. I have used it 5 times, so feel it has had time to work by now. I talked with customer service and Benjamin was wonderful. I don&#x27;t care how good a product might be, if you need customer service, it better be first rate. And these folks are. They are going to send me the Tea Tree shampoo because I read that it adds bulk and shine. I look forward to reviewing that one, too.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I have found for my itchy scalp and I have tried a LOT.  I have two spots on my head that are very itchy, I have had them for years, and this shampoo is the best one for keeping the itch down and not irritating the spots.  I do still have to use hydrocortisone on them, so that is why I only gave it 4 stars.  I honestly haven&#x27;t noticed much in the way of keeping my hair less greasy.  I do have oily hair, and I only wash it every 2 or three days.  My hair isn&#x27;t really any less greasy with this shampoo as compared to other shampoos.  However, my hair is beautiful using this.  Soft, shiny, healthy, very nice.  It also cleans very well, and gets all of my products out.  I just finished my second bottle, so have been using it for several months.</li>
    <li> my daughter in law got me hooked on this shampoo and let me use it and even after one use i could feel how clean it made my hair and scalp feel! I have tried many different types of shampoo but this one is by far the best. Even though i dont suffer from overly oily hair and scalp it still just made me feel extra clean. my daughter in law however does suffer from hair that has to be constantly washed and with this product she doesnt have to worry about her hair looking dirty the day after washing. such a great product. I would highly reccomend this to anyone even if they dont have greasy hair!!</li>
    <li> I have tried everything for my oily hair, I would love to skip a wash every now and then without looking like a grease ball so I gave this shampoo a try. I love that its natural and the smell is great. My hair definitely feels clean after using it but I found it to be a bit drying on the lower half of my hair since my scalp area is really the place that gets oily. I didn&#x27;t notice my hair staying cleaner longer which is what I was hoping for but overall, I like the shampoo; its just not a long-term solution and you definitely need a good conditioner for your ends so you can comb through your hair because of how drying this is.</li>
    <li> Stopped my scalp from itching that day!</li>
    <li> makes my hair as beautiful as I want it to be</li>
    <li> amazingly great shampoo...gotta try to appreciate!</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. The result as a cheap drug store clarifying shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo three days in a row. It has eliminated the itchy and excessively oily scalp/hair I&#x27;ve been plagued with for years. Small sample size of experience, but so far, so good.</li>
    <li> Very unhappy with this purchase</li>
    <li> Great product all around! After I had my second child, a lot of things changed–including my hormones. My hair had never been greasy before; I could actually go four days without washing my hair and it would look fine. But all of sudden my hair was greasy by the afternoon after washing it the night before. This shampoo saved the look and feel of my hair. I bought the &amp;#34;Silk 18&amp;#34; conditioner from Maple Holistics, too, and it smells just as amazing as the &amp;#34;Degrease&amp;#34; shampoo.</li>
    <li> Unlike other organic, herbal shampoos I have tried, Maple Holistics actually lathers. It smells great and, most importantly, cleans my hair and scalp. It&#x27;s the only shampoo I use now on my 6 inch long hair and have been spreading the word to friends as I pass on bottles for them to try. I use no more than the former brand name shampoos in order to lather. Makes me feel good that it&#x27;s environmentally friendly and that the ingredients are all-natural. I really do feel a difference...hair feels smooth and soft after every usage and lasts!!! I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband.  Used with the Tea Tree Oil Shampoo from same company because not sure which would be better. The combination of the two completely cleared up the angry red spots + dandruff on scalp and greasy hair.  Would recommend a hair conditioner, I think...waiting to see how his head levels out first though, since he&#x27;s only been using two weeks.  But a very dramatic difference, much better than the mainstream brand we had been using!</li>
    <li> When I first bought this product, after first use I had a great experience, scalp felt clean and refreshed, it wasn&#x27;t itchy and the product smelled great too - I even reviewed it as 5 stars. Now, after using it for a month or two I&#x27;ve broken out all over my scalp, causing severe itching and now scabs. My scalp is red and irritated and I have a constant urge to want to itch. I&#x27;m not over using it, I wash my hair every other day and I am only exclusively using this shampoo. I am very displeased because I had high hopes after my first use.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo for my 11 year old after trying numerous other brands with no success. I love the results I see as she finally has the appearance of clean hair! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m torn on this product. I bought it for my daughters greasy hair problem which it solved but in turn gave her an extremely dry flaky and itchy scalp. It&#x27;s pricy too</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for 10 days. I&#x27;ve been washing my hair every day or every other day during that time. I&#x27;ve followed the directions to the letter. My hair is greasier than ever. I have to wash it every day because it looks horrible if I don&#x27;t. This shampoo made my hair worse. I am very disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> My daughter has had very oily hair for some time and so I thought Degrease may benefit her. She doesn&#x27;t like to have to wash her hair every day, but by day 2 it needs it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo works very well - her hair is left clean and shiny, healthy looking and with &#x27;body&#x27;, which is a new experience for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone struggling with oily hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying many shampoos to control the oil in my hair and this one was by far the best.  I was hoping to get through just 18 hours without my hair looking greasy, and with this shampoo, I can go nearly 48 hours between shampoos without the oily/greasy look.  In addition, I also have horrible dandruff, especially in the winter.  After using this shampoo for 2 weeks, it has nearly eliminated the dandruff problem.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing! I normally have to wash my hair every day, if I don&#x27;t,  it gets so nasty looking. After using this shampoo, I can wash every other day. The bottle recommended wash, rinse, repeat. I didn&#x27;t repeat it. Also, love the tingling on my scalp. It&#x27;s a refreshing feeling. I will definitely buy this shampoo again.</li>
    <li> Great clean feeling!!</li>
    <li> My almost 10 yr old has started to have greasy looking hair by the end of each day.  Tried several shampoos and conditioners ranging from cheap to expensive.  a few helped the greasy look but they extremely dulled and faded her hairs&#x27; natural red color.  So I found this shampoo to try.  Wow- it worked great and her hair looks so healthy!!  The amazing thing was her hair looked even better on day 2 (without a daily wash)!  I&#x27;ve ordered this now 3 times and will continue to keep constant stock for her!  It seems have some natural conditioning properties so she needs very little amount of conditioner to maintain tangle free long hair.  Since observing these results on her- I now use it on my own blonde hair.  I get several compliments on my healthy looking hair.  My scalp is very sensitive to many shampoos/conditioners - I break out often due to an autoimmune disease. I&#x27;ve used this consistently for 2 months and no break outs!  So glad I have found maple holistics products!  Highly recommend!  Now if I could just buy in bulk quantities on Amazon...this is my only request.</li>
    <li> Update : It has been longer than a month since I started to use this product and I absulately love it for three good reasons. First, My hair hasn&#x27;t looked healthier; It is longer than ever right now and have no split ends which I always get after a certain length. Second, this shampoo has extended my hair color life by at least a week; I used to dye my hair every five weeks, right now I am in my sixth week and looks like I can go for another week or so. Although my grey hair started to show a little in the roots, the dye on my hair hasn&#x27;t been stripped like when I used other &amp;#34;color care&amp;#34; products. Third, I can still wash my hair often without worrying about stripping my hair dye and. And finally, although it is gentle on the hair dye it really is tough on the grease. For me, It takes only a couple shampooing to make my hair squeaky clean as oppose to other shampoos which took three or four.   I have a very oily hair and itchy scalp and I have been looking for the right shampoo that is sulfate free and also for oily hair. I got very excited when I saw this product on Amazon and decided to give it a shot. I used it right away when it arrived yesterday. I loved the natural smell and how my hair felt really clean after washing but it made my hair tangly so I ended up using conditioner on the ends which I rather avoid to do since conditioner makes my oily hair flatter and heavier. Although, my hair does not feel so oily today, my itchy scalp is back. But the itch may be related to the dry air of cold winter that we have where I live so I&#x27;d like to give this product time to see what it does in the long run.</li>
    <li> This shampoo worked very well for my oily, itchy hair. I had been using Head &amp; Shoulders, but it wasn&#x27;t having much effect. I started using Maple Holistics two weeks ago, and I immediately noticed a difference. After washing and drying, my hair feels softer, less oily, and stays that way for about 24 hours.</li>
    <li> Since I have been using this shampoo I have noticed a significant improvement in the health of my scalp. I have tried a different products in the past which did not work well. I can tell that this product impress me a lot,  I am using it according to the instructions and I truly like how it works. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so thrilled with this shampoo! It&#x27;s honestly done wonders for my scalp &amp; hair. My hair feels so much cleaner and smoother without having been stripped of its natural oils. With other products, I have to use so much in order to get my hair to feel/appear clean, but with this, I can use a small amount and get amazing results. If you&#x27;re having second thoughts about ordering this, don&#x27;t! It&#x27;s worth every penny and more.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 14 year old son who has oily hair. After showering the night before, he would come home from school with his hair already appearing oily again. With this shampoo, his hair is still oil free at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> This shampoo really is amazing.  I was surprised to find that it worked the very first time it was used, even on very thick hair.  Also, it has a very nice botanic-like scent, without being too overwhelming or leaving one smell like a crunchy.  Indeed, the price is higher than what you are used to paying for shampoo in a drug store, but a little bit goes a long way because, even if you don&#x27;t have shampoo with it every day, the effects of it seem to last.  What more is there to say?  Give this stuff a try.  Really.</li>
    <li> Nice smell and you can really tell that it removes all of the gunk from your hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works! I shampoo my hair every night because of my oily scalp. I used good quality shampoo like Aveda, but still had itchy and oily hair in the afternoon. After reading all the reviews, I bought this shampoo and gave it a try. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week. I&#x27;m satisfied with the result. My scalp has been less itchy and oily. Two things I don&#x27;t like: one is the price and the other is how terribly dry my hair is after rinsing.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed my hair being less greasy. My hair looks good for 2 days, which is great, but other high quality shampoos I&#x27;ve used last the same amount of time. (Including others from Maple Holistics.)&lt;br /&gt;The reason this shampoo gets 5 stars is because it smells WONDERFUL! Herbs with a hint of sweetness--it reminds me of a warm summer day. I  love it!</li>
    <li> For a long time I&#x27;ve been suffering from really oily/ greasy hair and no matter what shampoo I used, I needed to wash my hair every single day to keep it from getting oily. I decided to buy this shampoo based on the reviews that I found online and honestly I&#x27;m so glad I did. At first I was skeptical about buying it since it seems a little pricey for such a little bottle, but honestly it&#x27;s worth it. After using it for couple of times I definitely saw an improvement in my usually very oily scalp. This is no magic so you will have to be a little patient to see good result so don&#x27;t be discouraged if you don&#x27;t see a difference after one use. I will definitely buy this again! :)</li>
    <li> Finally i have found a shampoo that really works for oily hair</li>
    <li> I am in my 60&#x27;s and have colored, thinning, oily, baby fine hair with a scalp that itches like crazy if I use the wrong shampoo.  Over the years, I have tried various shampoos to keep my hair as healthy as possible, but most of them had to be replaced in a very short amount of time because of itching, or excessive tangling.  Approximately three weeks ago I began using Maple Holistics Degreaser shampoo.  What a difference!  My hair is in excellent condition, my scalp does not itch, and there is no longer excessive breakage after each shampoo. I am just so amazed at the fast results that I had to add my review to Amazon.</li>
    <li> Makes hair feel clean and it has a good natural smell. I gave it 4/5 stars because it is extremely expensive. I wish the company made bigger bottles.</li>
    <li> As usual I was skeptical but bought any way. I have a very oily complexion on my face and scalp and nothing seemed to work long lasting. Well this turned out to be one of the best health products I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon. Not only did it work but lasted all day at work! My scalp felt clean and non-oily all day. I shave my head(not much hair left) and this is a big improvement. Thanks to Maple Holistics and a great product!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect shampoo for someone like me who is always having trouble finding a great shampoo for oily hair. I have found it increasingly hard over the past few years to find a great shampoo like this one. I took a chance and ordered Degrease shampoo based on all of the reviews here at Amazon plus a little research which I had done on my own using Google. Thank goodness for Maple Holistics and and their amazing moisture control shampoo!</li>
    <li> This shampoo works great, it has eliminated the oily hair I have, despite not using condition and using shampoo every day. Love this shampoo!</li>
    <li> I will not buy this item.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS SHAMPOO GREAT FOR OILY HAIR THE ONLY THING THAT ACTUALLY WORKED CAN WASH MY HAIR EVERY OTHER DAY AND NOT USE DRY SHAMPOO  AND NOT LOOK LIKE I JUST STEPPED OUT OF A DEEP FRYER</li>
    <li> I have to wash my hair daily. Can&#x27;t get around it (believe me, I&#x27;ve tried. Ick.) It has a pleasant fragrance. The bottle does not squeeze easily. Doesn&#x27;t really lather up the way you feel like it should. Considering it&#x27;s price tag, I really shouldn&#x27;t need a second lathering. As it is, I have long, thick hair and already need to use a rather generous amount the first time around. My first use, I was unimpressed, however I continued to use it, incorporating it into my shampoo lineup of options. It&#x27;s been about 4 months and I still feel Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree Special Shampoo performs better.</li>
    <li> Smells medicinal and left my hair feeling like straw. Definitely succeeded at &amp;#34;degreasing&amp;#34; my hair though!</li>
    <li> I have never written a review for any product before but I do rely heavily on them when I am looking to purchase something. I can tell you that this product is A- maz- ing!! I have very oily skin and hair. I have tried everything and nothing worked until I found this. I have never been able to use a sulfate free shampoo before because my hair would never feel clean as it is naturally oily.but this sulfate free shampoo WORKS. Not only does it make my hair feel clean and not greasy it feels softer than it ever has. I also dye my hair regularly because I am going gray and it does not strip the color out of my hair. I will continue to use this product and try other Mapleholistics products in the future.</li>
    <li> This product works great for me. I&#x27;m writing this review after ordering my second bottle. I have fine, thin, blonde hair. I try to only wash it a couple times a week, if I can and use dry shampoo in between washes. It still tends to get greasy (probably because of all the other products I use), but this shampoo has helped significantly. Some other reviews have complained about the smell but I like it. It smells just like rosemary. It lathers well and leaves my scalp and strands feeling clean.  I really appreciate that it&#x27;s organic, paraben, phtalate, sulfate, and fragrance free. That&#x27;s a big selling point for me.  It&#x27;s a little pricey for an 8oz bottle but worth it if you don&#x27;t mind paying for quality. I would like to see the company start selling it in 16 or 32oz.</li>
    <li> Really takes the itch away if used as directed. Great product!</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair nice smells like ingredients but I still have to wash my hair every 2 days. And $17.00 a bottle is too much</li>
    <li> Despite great positive reviews, this product didn&#x27;t make a difference for me. Used a whole bottle regularly over course of about 2 months - no noticeable change. Definitely not justifying the high price of the product.</li>
    <li> I have greasy hair, and tried many shampoo for oil-control. This product is the best of all those I have used so far.</li>
    <li> I bought this item very sceptical that it would get rid of the oiliness but it really works and I even bought it for a friend</li>
    <li> It doesnt really work. Yes, there is less oil when you first wash it but then the scalp gets even oilier and your hair looks like hay strands, very dry.</li>
    <li> I have extremely greasy/oily and dry course hair. I was very skeptical about this product because I have tried all sorts of shampoo recommended for my hair type. The first time I washed my hair I shampooed it twice. I could instantly tell a difference in the texture. After my hair dried it looked noticeably shiny but not oily. I usually have to wash my hair everyday to keep it under control but with this shampoo I can skip a day or two with no problem. I would definitely recommend this to anyone having the same issues as me.</li>
    <li> I have really oily and itchy hair and try many other shampoo before. I have to say I will stay with this one.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected... did not help with my oily hair...  disappointed</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo because I really wanted to have a shampoo that was free of sulfates, chemicals, and that worked.  After reading so many positive reviews, I ordered it.  I must admit the smell is not my favorite, but it is mild when using it and not overpowering.  I wanted to wait awhile after using it before I posted my review.  I love all of the ingredients!  I like the way it leaves my hair and scalp feeling clean.  I did notice though that the volume of my hair has decreased after washing, but it does look and feel clean.  My biggest complaint would be that it comes in a very small bottle.  I have long hair and I need to use quite a bit, so it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  I wish they sold it in larger quantities so it wouldn&#x27;t be so expensive.  Having said that I will probably order again.</li>
    <li> This works very well.  It has a pine scent which is fairly overwhelming.</li>
    <li> Bought for my 19 year old daughter. She won&#x27;t use as she doesn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t experience the results I hoped for after reading all the reviews, I have been looking for a solution to not washing my hair daily for years.  It worked to remove the oily build up that day but I still needed to wash my hair every day.  By the time I got up in the morning it was oily again.  I followed the directions on the bottle (washing twice).  I had to use a conditioner on the ends of my hair because this shampoo dried it out SO badly.  Prior to using this shampoo my scalp was not itchy but using this shampoo caused it too itch.  My hair began to fall out more quickly.  I used it a few weeks waiting for the awesome results, needless to say they never came.</li>
    <li> Reading other&#x27;s reviews I gave this shampoo a try. My hair becomes oily one day after the wash. It doesn&#x27;t solve my dandruff problems either. Should probably try the sage shampoo but there are reviews that it contains harmful chemicals. The only think I like about the shampoo is it being natural and provides lather very quickly. I did try various other shampoos but nothing gave a better result either. Probably will stick to this until I find something better.</li>
    <li> This has helped with oil control and itch but has not eliminated them.  One big benefit is that, I believe, it has helped to relieve some problem scalp odor.  So for that reason, I will keep using.</li>
    <li> Cleans my hair of the filth and grime that collects while staying outside and in the heat of the kitchen, with the oils and aroma wafting through the air.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, the reviews were very helpful!  The reviews helped me decide that this was the product I was looking for.  My teenage daughter has seen a big difference in her hair.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t appear to stop the itching.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo!  Degreases hair without stripping.  Like that it is such a natural product. Nice &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; scent.  My new favorite shampoo.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I suffer from greasy hair.  This product helps to control that for longer than normal shampoos.  I love the lather of the product and the overall feel it leaves.  I have been using this product for a while now and am very happy to finally have found something that works.</li>
    <li> It is good and makes my oily hair clean and shiny.....but makes my hair more oily once I skip using it for a day or two. Also my hair fall while shampooing have reduced a lot while using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product!had repurchase many times.kept grease away the whole day!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is incredible after the first time of using it. It smells really good and I recommend it to people suffering from oily hair. I started to use it for a while and it regulated my hair back to normal so it’s not oily anymore and my scalp feels great after using it!</li>
    <li> if your hair is really oily, shampoo with your next favorite shampoo first, then use this one as directed, otherwise you will not make suds or its just not enough (quarter size amount). I have an itchy, oily scalp. There is nothing that works out there.[  My favorite product is Bed Head especially the conditioners. My search is still not over. I still want to check out The Body Shop shampoo products later.] This shampoo does not irritate the scalp, nor is over drying. My hair is falling out less, and stays unoily a little bit longer. Smells great! I will buy this again!</li>
    <li> I used to wash my hair every other day now I can go 3 days without a headache For those who wash their hair every day worth to give it a try. 5***** :)</li>
    <li> I tried washing my hair by following the directions on the bottle, and I have to say that I am not very pleased with the results. In the product description it says that this shampoo is supposed to remove the EXCESS of oils from hair, however, when I used this shampoo it removed all of the  moisture from my hair and made my hair incredibly dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had to wash my hair every day or be a grease monkey, my whole life. I&#x27;m super greatful to of found this product. I used to only have about 4-5 hours of oil free, volume rich hair before it started to weigh down and I had to cave and pull it up. I NOW CAN ENJOY ALL DAY BEAUTIFUL HAIR! It&#x27;s not a cure all for me- I sweat every day with either my work or exercise and I feel that as long as I do that, I&#x27;ll have to wash my hair every day. My only complaint (besides the expense) is it&#x27;s nearly impossible to brush your hair out after washing. I&#x27;ve found that a couple sprits of &amp;#34;Mane &amp; Tail&amp;#34; spay conditioner helps at getting my brush through and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down too much. It also helps with static, which I found was a problem without conditioner. I&#x27;ve told a lot of my friends and my stylist about this product, that&#x27;s how happy I am with it. Maple Holistics - make a lightweight conditioner to go with Degrease! And contact me with wholesale prices! Thanks! I recommend this!</li>
    <li> The shampoo feels good on my hair. I can feel that it works through the scalp and gets me feeling light and happy because of the smell of rosemary.</li>
    <li> This stuff really impressed me.  It surpassed my expectations.  It smells really great, lathers great, and I can go a full day or two longer without washing my hair.  I rub it into my roots, then without rinsing, apply conditioner to my ends and let it all sit throughout my shower.  It is a little pricey but well worth it in my opinion. Probably cost-effective when you think about the hot water I&#x27;m not using to wash greasy hair every day. I&#x27;ve already ordered more.</li>
    <li> I have long wavy hair and my hair is thick but when I wash my hair I don&#x27;t use a conditioner but a leave in conditioner and then air dry and by the next day my scalp is OILY I have to wash again and made my hair dry at the ends and this product has changed everything my hair is good for 3 days! I never thought it could be possible I am so happy that I found this shampoo and my hair is shiny and has bounce not flat and slick like I put a pomade in my hair YUCK! If you struggle with oily itchy scalp and tried of Washing your hair and drying out your ends try this shampoo and you will be relieved from all that oily mess, I also have sensitive skin and this shampoo does not irratate my acne too I hope my review helps you I have been looking for so long for this shampoo and I am so happy I did it has changed my hair for the BEST!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something to clean my hair well, and I&#x27;ve read some reviews and they are all positive. Good thing I trusted my instinct, this is the best and not feminine smelling shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I received this from my mom.  I have always had oily hair.  I LOVE this!  I have been using this for about 2 weeks and noticed a huge difference in my hair!  It looks good... shiny... doesn&#x27;t look oily by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I recently tried out this product while staying at a friends house. I tried it, and I was pleased with the results. My hair is generally pretty oily, but this shampoo seemed to keep my hair grease free. Would recommend to anyone who struggles with greasy/oily hair.</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair that gets oily quickly, and this shampoo definitely helps my scalp. It makes it less itchy and it helps alleviate the clogged pores that I get on my scalp. The difference on my hair overall is not substantial, though; my hair is a little less oily the day after washing, but I still definitely would not be able to go a day without washing it. Although it is a bit expensive for the size, you only need to use a very small amount to get a nice lather. The main issue I&#x27;ve had is that when I packed it to travel, it leaked out of the area where the top screws onto the bottle (even though it was screwed on tightly). This wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal, but with a $20 bottle of shampoo, I feel as if I&#x27;ll be losing a few dollars worth every time I travel. Nonetheless, it makes my scalp feel a lot more healthy and clean, so I will keep buying it as long as it continues doing that.</li>
    <li> I love this Shampoo! It smells great. The scent is calming (lavender) and is great to use if you shower at night. Helps you sleep! Leaves your hair very soft and manageable. My husband likes the grease breaking ability after a long day.  Wonderful product :)</li>
    <li> I have extremly oily hair and during the summer( here in GA) it gets worse. After using this I was surprised how well it worked. My hair was no wear near as oily and I could actually go a day with out washing it! And being a busy mom, that works for me! Thanks maple holistics!!!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing! I have had a very oily scalp in the past that always let me hair feeling gross. Not with maple holistics degrease! This product is fantastic and leaves my hair non-oily until the next wash. Repeat customer. Worth it!</li>
    <li> My hair is always so greasy even though i wash it everyday. This shampoo changed everything! My hair looks great now and ive never been happier with it:)</li>
    <li> I LOVE this Shampoo. My hair is so oily and greasy, I can wash it in the morning and by nighttime it already had that &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; feeling. I have tried so many products and different shampoos..some are worse than others.. but this one is fantastic. I could tell a difference after the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is fantastic for oíl hair i love it</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful for my daughter who suffers from oily itchy hair. She is no long embarrassed due to her hair.Thank you for your great products..</li>
    <li> I received a sample size of the degrease shampoo to try. Let me give you a little background on my hair. I have thick strands but fine hair in volume. It is straight and color treated. It gets oily easily where I cannot go 24 hours without washing it or else my scalp will be itchy and stick to my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used this three time so far and have noticed a difference. The first time I used it once instead of the double use as instructed, and noticed that my hair is less oily. When I use it with the double use it feels much nicer, although still try at the ends (again my hair is color treated). Since using this I have managed to not wash my hair on day 2, just tie it up in a ponytail and it still looks great. I have never been able to manage that before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I would like to try the conditioner that comes with this line and will update my review. So far I have been using my moroccan oil afterwards and its been fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only confusion is that they say that they use homeopathic concept but the ingredients are based on essential oils. I am currently working on my homeopathic certification so this confuses me a bit. Other than that (it have nothing to do with the product but more so on the nickpicky details of what is printed on their website) I do love this product. It have worked better than all the other shampoos that I have tried.</li>
    <li> nice product. very useful in terms of controlling oily hair. I am buying this a third time!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. I am 55 years old and tired of having oily scalp/skin. This shampoo really seems to combat the itchiness and grease I was putting up with. I no longer use a conditioner in the shower, just the shampoo and then a keratin product on hair only. Works great and smells good too!</li>
    <li> Removes hair products easily like the hair spray and temporary hair color.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the shampoo.  I have NEVER been able to go more than 24&lt;br /&gt;hours without washing my hair, due to my oily scalp.  Now I can get 2 days&lt;br /&gt;between washes, it is liberating.  Love the product.</li>
    <li> is it possible that I have finally found a shampoo that works to allow me to have short hair, and not look like a grease ball in 6 hrs...this is it! Please if you have thin oily hair try this shampoo.....plus its easy on your hair. if you wash everyday...I have never done my hair so fast before. not stuck in house because of time constraints on washing hair. truly this shampoo has made a difference in my life.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite shampoo, and have tried many different ones over the last few months, leaves hair clean, silky, shiny, soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know any other shampoos that provide all that for thin, fine hair. Fast delivery and well packaged.</li>
    <li> per the reviews i read about this i was really hoping this would solve my oily scalp issue but, unfortunately, it did not.  I used the product for 3-4 weeks , i have very fine naturally blonde hair that is completely unprocessed and rather untouched, and usually very silky to the touch. i don&#x27;t style my hair more than once every several weeks, use product maybe a handful of times a year.  i work out before work 5 days a week so i can&#x27;t go without washing my hair every day; while my hair is lovely right after a shower, by the end of the day the hair two inches closest to my scalp is oily and the next morning it&#x27;s even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the shampoo i received was very thick, i was sure to shake it prior to use, massage deeply, leave on for a few minutes.  enjoyed the smell, the sudsing was wonderful but once i start rinsing my hair felt like straw.  even after using conditioner (wen (one pump) only at the ends) my hair was difficult to comb through (when i was using a different shampoo (Say Yes to Tomatoes) and Wen i didn&#x27;t really need to comb through - my hair was never knotty or tangled)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bottom line: did not work in controlling/mitigating my oily scalp</li>
    <li> This shampoo is everything the seller says and more. Love it! Best I have ever used for my hair and I am 76 so that covers a lot of shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love brushing my hair now that it&#x27;s a lot smoother and less greasy than before. It is a godsend that I have discovered this little shampoo here. I got this and I used it everyday and now my hair is healthier than ever. It smells really great too for those who are attracted to shampoo scents, this is the best smelling one I have used.</li>
    <li> While I don&#x27;t know much biology behind this product, it works. Do not expect all your hair issues to magically disappear. I wash my hair every 2nd day, but it does not look perfectly fresh on day 2 if I use different products. I still wash it every 2nd day, but this product made my hair look good on day two. Smells good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had success.  It&#x27;s helped. I would like a conditioner.</li>
    <li> shine-boosting shampoo</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for a few weeks, every four days or so and it works great. I am not using any conditioner, just this shampoo. It gives my hair the perfect texture and oil balance. Nothing on the bottle says that any of the ingredients are organic, though.</li>
    <li> My pre-teen daughter has greasy hair and this works well. It isn&#x27;t perfect and it is pricey, but it is better than the grocery store shampoos.</li>
    <li> I read Sandra the dermatologist&#x27;s review (which was VERY informative) and decided to give it a try. I was NOT disappointed. I&#x27;d been struggling with an itchy/flaky/oily scalp with greasy hair for quite a long time. I&#x27;d tried various shampoos, even an organic shampoo and shampoos meant specifically for dandruff, but nothing helped. With this stuff, from day one I could feel a difference. It&#x27;s now the only shampoo I&#x27;ll use and I&#x27;ve already come back to buy a second bottle.</li>
    <li> I have greasy hair and an oily scalp, which has only grown worse as I&#x27;ve aged (currently 23, male), because of this I had to chop off my long hair and resort to shorter hairstyles, and although this probably makes me more presentable, I miss having natural long hair. Yet even with short hair, after shampooing it often becomes greasy and oily half-way through the day, and an absolute mess the next day. I can&#x27;t even think about not shampooing everyday. On top of being greasy and oily, I also have some dandruff and an itchy scalp. So I decided to try &amp;#34;degrease&amp;#34; and after one day I feel like I can already tell a difference, my hair felt great after showering and when I woke up this morning it wasn&#x27;t as unruly as usual, there is still a little grease but that&#x27;s normal and I was even able to go outside without having to immediately shower or worry about my oily hair before hand. Now it&#x27;s only been a day and I wish the bottle was a little bigger and I will have to update this review in the future to tell if my hair continues to progress forwards, but I feel like it&#x27;s heading in the right direction. So far I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with oily hair and scalp. My hope is that I won&#x27;t have to shampoo everyday and can eventually grow my long hair back out and not have Severus Snape or Grima Wormtongue&#x27;s thin, oily hair. Five stars for at least giving me hope.</li>
    <li> Only shampoo that is working on my husband&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> This is one of the natural shampoos, and my only criticism is&lt;br /&gt;that it is very thin, and I feel like none of it stays in my hand&lt;br /&gt;long enough to raise it to my head. Obviously some of it does, but&lt;br /&gt;it feels like it&#x27;s pouring onto the shower floor out of my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as cleaning, it seems to do a nice job. I like it</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. I will buy it again.  I like the smell also.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo that leaves hair feeling clean and refreshed. The only downside is the size of the bottle.</li>
    <li> My husband keeps looking for this as he says that this is a great shampoo for his especially oily hair.</li>
    <li> Does what it says and really feel my scalp cleaned from excess oil after a shower. I have overactive sebaceous glands on days I drink caffeine or take diet pills when I work out and this shampoo really does the trick in keeping my hair oil free. I will def reorder another one.</li>
    <li> I really likes the product as a teen i have very thick hair and struggle to use other shampoos to clean without over drying the hair and making it frizzy. This is the perfect product for anybody as its so well balanced that it leaves you with the nicest feeling after washing your hair.  Great Product will be looking at others in the future.</li>
    <li> I am pleased to review a product that worked for me exactly as it said it would.  I purchased this shampoo a few weeks ago and wanted to wait until I had used it enough times before writing a review, no more oily, itchy or greasy hair for me.  For the past few years I have had extremely oily hair and have done the whole &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; thing, tried cleansing conditioners, everything to try and cut back on the oil production from my scalp, nothing worked.  With other shampoos my hair was already oily immediately after use and I had begun to think that oily, greasy hair was my fate and to just suck it up and accept it.  After reading the great reviews I was keen to give this shampoo a try and it did not disappoint.  From the first use my hair looked and felt great, I thought it might have just been a &amp;#34;new shampoo&amp;#34; effect, but no, its like that every time I wash it and stays like that for days.  I wash twice a week and my hair does not look oily, just healthy like when I was in my teens, it is finally my natural lighter brown color, not the dingy dark brown/black color it had been when it was oily and greasy.  It feels so much lighter (weight wise) too without all the oil weighing it down, which makes a huge difference with long hair.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy to have found a product that works for me.</li>
    <li> I usually use Deva Curl no-poo shampoo but lately it was leaving my hair greasy. So I decided to try this natural shampoo instead. I love the smell, something I did not like about the Deva Curl no-poo. I love how it is natural and my curly hair seems to respond to it quite well. It allows my hair to have a natural shin that isn&#x27;t because of grease build up and my hair is so soft. I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of complements since using the product. I will say that it is a great product for short hair since it is closer to the scalp, those of us with already greasy heads tend to have very greasy hair when short. Plus once again I love the smell.</li>
    <li> Its okay but can be drying if you use too much!</li>
    <li> The product is good. Its herbal. Being a male, we are more conscious to the hair fall. My scale is oily and I needed to shampoo at each bath to avoid the greasiness. Oily scalp attracts dirt as they stick to the scalp and makes your hair look dull.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for something which I can apply daily and it wont affect my hairs(chemicals and all you know)&lt;br /&gt;This product is mild and I can use it daily without worries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would be nice if the product improve further and we can use it every two days.. Hahaha.. I know I am being greedy, but yes, to oily scalp guys, I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Short story: this isn&#x27;t the best shampoo for oily hair and it&#x27;s expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story: When I first bought and used this product, it was the best oily hair &#x27;degreaser&#x27; I had ever used, so it was the best in my limited experience.  Still, I thought there must be something a little better out there since it took two washes to degrease my moderately greasy hair and it didn&#x27;t last that long.  I would be greasy again within 8 hours.  Also, the price of seventeen dollars for 8 ounces is a negative, especially when there is a much cheaper and better shampoo on the market, namely: Lemon Tea Tree Shampoo by Desert Essence Organics.  This shampoo is much cheaper, degreases better and works longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think any review by someone who has accepted a free sample for their presumably positive review is a compromised review.  I don&#x27;t care who you are, your review is worthless.  This company offers such free trials to their consumers, which is the only reason why it&#x27;s rated as high as it is.  I too was offered a free trial for my review, considered it, but then ruled against it because I wouldn&#x27;t have been completely honest with consumers.  Nobody who thinks the product is between a 3 and a 4 is going to give it 3 stars and ask for the free bottle.  Heck, I doubt many who got a free bottle and reviewed it gave it anything less than a 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this shampoo does a fair job, not good job, of degreasing, and is expensive.  For the same price you can get 16 ounces of a better product.</li>
    <li> I have always had fine, oily hair, but after the birth of my second son my hair was greasier than when I was a teenager.  After trying some home remedies that failed, I found a lemon scented clarifying shampoo from Avalon Organics.  It worked wonders on my hair for several months, but then it quit \\&quot;working.\\&quot;  I tried this next and didn&#x27;t notice a change.  I washed my hair twice as indicated for a few days, but when it didn&#x27;t fix my problem, I assumed it was a marketing technique to get the customer to use more.  I was so frustrated, I just gave up trying to find a solution to my oily hair and decided to use this up - it was too expensive to waste.  After a couple months of using it, I started following the directions again - washing my hair twice.  This time, I really massaged this into my scalp and waited several minutes before rinsing well each time.  Now, my hair is normal again.  I&#x27;m just sorry I didn&#x27;t follow the directions sooner!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy in my 20s with thinning hair and a dry scalp. I wash my hair once a day every day. I never really considered my hair &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;.. I keep it fairly short and I wash it every day so it doesn&#x27;t really have a chance to get greasy. I did some research on the more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoos (AKA read product reviews for the top rated shampoos) and while I didn&#x27;t think my hair or scalp necessarily needed degreased, I decided to go with this one. I bought directly from their website and saved a little by buying two bottles. Shipping was free and reasonably fast. I have no complaints about the product or how it works. For that, I would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Smells fresh and outdoorsy (a little bit like pine or something maybe?) and isn&#x27;t at all overpowering. Lathers well. I think my scalp was in better shape even after a couple days of using it.&lt;br /&gt;CONS: The price. That&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: Buy it. It&#x27;s good. But the price really does need to come down in my opinion. I won&#x27;t take 1 star off for price.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this, but it made my hair too dry and tangled my hair while I was still washing it. I tried it a few times, thinking maybe a different conditioner would make it better, but it didn&#x27;t help. And it also didn&#x27;t help my oily scalp. I liked the smell though.</li>
    <li> His hair looks SO much better, and he&#x27;s happy with it too.</li>
    <li> Excellent!!! My hair looks beautiful!!!</li>
    <li> Expensive, and unfortunately it did not do anything for me. It felt pleasant on my scalp (I liked the cool, slightly itchy feeling), it cleaned my hair very well without leaving it strawy, but it did not reduce the oiliness - I still had too wash it pretty much daily.</li>
    <li> I have oily hair so I tried out this shampoo. My hair feels really refreshed after the shower, but I don&#x27;t think the shampoo does a better job than other well-known brands in oil control. However, I really like the mild nature of it, that&#x27;s the main reason I&#x27;m switching to this product.</li>
    <li> If I could give this 0 stars I would. Not only did my hair stay oily, it dried my hair out so bad that I had a hard time brushing my hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a truly natural shampoo that will effectively clean my teenage daughter&#x27;s oily hair and scalp.  I&#x27;m excited to say this worked!  And, it worked well!</li>
    <li> This stuff works!!!! I can go three days without washing finally!!! Although it does make my ends dry out faster, I spritz those with leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> good to the scalp and great to the hair</li>
    <li> I really like using this product...I have been searching a long time for a clarifying shampoo that does not dry out my hair.  I am not sure how &#x27;natural&#x27; these ingredients are, this is certainly not a completely organic product...but I am confident the ingredients used om this formula are not abrasive with very little chemical exposure (although, truthfully, I would have preferred a completely organic product).  The shampoo truly does degrease my hair leaving it feeling soft and light.  It doesn&#x27;t get weighed down with shampoo film or buildup.  It has a foamy texture and the scent is pleasing and lasting with rosemary and other essential oils.  The only reason I am giving it four stars is because I expected it to somehow reduce my daily shampoo routine.  After using it for about a month, my hair is still producing excessive oils.  I was hoping to reduce the number of shampoos but at least if I am shampooing daily I can rest assured that I am using a quality product that leaves my hair silky and shiny.  Maybe I will try the conditioner next.</li>
    <li> I have tried variety of shampoos for my oily scalp but none of them truly worked.  I was quite surprised at how well this product worked just after a week of using it.  My hair feels a lot better after using Degrease and my face is a lot less oily because of it.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a shampoo that helps with their oily scalp.</li>
    <li> An effective shampoo for my hair type. My hair is curly and it really gathers oil and grease through out the day. This is helping in significantly reducing the amount of grease in my hair before I go to sleep.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing shampoo. Only shampoo I have found that has cured my oily scalp problem. I couldn&#x27;t even walk out in the rain and return inside, dry my hair and find within half an hour my hair was oily again simply because it got damp from some rain drops. I follow up with the silk18 conditioner once in a while (I have long hair, about 30 inches or so).</li>
    <li> I think anyone would love this who has greasy and itchy hair. My hair had itched for days and it would get greasy the next day but with this shampoo not only does it get fuller but a lot more natural and healthier. This is the perfect remedy for you if you have these problems with your hair.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this is supposed to be a shampoo for greasy hair. I followed the directions exactly... washing twice and leaving the shampoo on for a couple of minutes each time. My hair actually got greasy more quickly than the usual shampoo I use (Pantene Pro-V Color Preserve Volume). I usually wash every other day in the morning. With my usual shampoo on day 2 my hair is getting limp and a bit oily as the day wears on, day 3 is completely greasy hair and I wash again. With this shampoo I did not make it to the end of day 1 (the day I washed my hair) without being too greasy. I avoided washing on day 2 for the purposes of testing the shampoo by using copious amounts of dry shampoo (I love Klorane). I then used this shampoo again exactly as instructed thinking that I would give it another try. Same results... oily and gross by the end of the same day I washed it. I have not used it again.</li>
    <li> It does the promise of de-greasing the scalp and making the scalp less itchy BUT it dried out my hair and made it so brittle. I also used the recommended natural conditioner but it helped very little. My hair became so hard to comb or brush after washing  because it was all tangled up.  It&#x27;s sad, I thought this was the product that will solve my life long struggle with oily scalp but it disappointed me. I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the product for too long, but it seems to keep my hair less oily throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Works great if you do not want a lot of product in your hair.</li>
    <li> Without a doubt this is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used to help relieve my oily, itchy scalp. It lathers up well and leaves my hair feeling thick, clean, and free of excess oil. I&#x27;ve had an oily scalp over the past few years and tried a range of different products such as Nizoral, Therapeutic T-Sal, Head &amp; Shoulders, and many others. Unfortunately, most of them left my scalp dried out/irritated which increased oil production and flaking. However, this product is the only one that has consistently relieved my scalp and also improved the texture of my hair. I don&#x27;t know what else I would use if it weren&#x27;t for this shampoo. I&#x27;ve purchased a few bottles in the past and don&#x27;t have any plans on switching to another brand. I highly recommend this product as many have stated in other reviews!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely, awesome!  Does exactly what it is suppose to do.  My daughter is 16 and has very greasy hair, which for a teenage girl could be disastrous.  After the very first shampoo it was working!  Removed all the residue left behind from other shampoos, conditioners, mousse, etc.  Her hair is thick and beautiful and needs only to be washed every other night.  We are even able to continue using a light conditioner for tangles and mousse for styling.  We are on our 3rd bottle and I would never buy anything else.  Worth every penny that you spend.  By the way, you do not need to use a lot...lathers beautifully.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this shampoo and have been using it for over a week now.  It&#x27;s AMAZING!!!  I&#x27;ve had a problem with my scalp for the longest time and every shampoo I have purchased has done nothing to help.  My problem has finally been solved.  It works great and smells great.  I&#x27;m going to try the conditioner as well now.</li>
    <li> I tried a sample of the Degrease shampoo for my daughter.  She has been struggling with an oily, very itchy scalp, with a small amount of dandruff.  She has been using it daily for almost a month.  Her dandruff is gone and her itchiness has significantly improved.  Her hair is very clean after shampooing, but still gets oily less than 24hours after shampooing.  I&#x27;m hoping this will continue to improve.  I&#x27;m happy to see her scalp is more comfortable and less inflamed looking.  This is better than any other shampoo we&#x27;ve tried for her.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have greasy hair, but I DO have scalp psoriasis. This shampoo manages to soothe the itchies, lessen scaling, and calm it down quite well. All without smelling horrible like the conventional psoriasis shampoos (tar shampoo&#x3D;olfactory hell). There is a bit of a transition; I used it a good three times before I started to see any improvement and now I really appreciate it. Lastly, I know there&#x27;s been some issues with ingredients (SLS and such). If you have scalp psoriasis, you&#x27;ll pretty much use shampoo made from endangered baby seal tears if it alleviates your condition, so anything even remotely natural is just icing on the cake.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this shampoo because it worked for at least 3 days then it failed me. just like all the shampoos I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;It smells strongly of potatoes. I want to smell potatoes out from my kitchen, not from a shampoo! And then it doesn&#x27;t completely control&lt;br /&gt;the excess oily from the scalp. Plus the moisture from the hair is present long after you shampoo. Don&#x27;t spend money on this junk!!!&lt;br /&gt;Oh one more thing, this shampoo only creates more buildup. One more reason not to buy this crap shampoo.</li>
    <li> i have use this for about a week. it does what it suggests and takes out the oil from your hair after you wash. i am not sure how much it will work in the long run because the following day after my hair is still a little oily. maybe if i keep using it then it might fix that problem.&lt;br /&gt;also the price is on the tad expensive side. that might make people question trying out this product.</li>
    <li> I have a teen with flaky head and oily hair so we were having trouble finding something that would help both.  THIS DID!  Her hair is beautifully soft now and her scalp Is healthy.  Very happy with this purchase and I just close my eyes and click because the price is crazy!  I will say that she&#x27;s used it for at least 4-5 times now and has barely made a dent in the bottle so, apparently, a little can go a long way.  She just adds water to her head to spread it around since it doesn&#x27;t suds much.</li>
    <li> Loved it! This is the third shampoo I tried, all other ones either didn&#x27;t help or where drying up my hear.  This one has it all, my hair looks great and my scalp is healthy!</li>
    <li> The shampoo was exactly what Ive needed for a very long time. This Shampoo smells nice, cleans really well and the only shampoo Ive been able to use and not have an itchy scalp 30 minutes to the next shampoo. Most shampoos for oily hair dry out your scalp and make it itch. And the best part is how clean and shinny my hair looks and feels, Ill never use any other shampoo. And its organic, what more could I want. I LOVE!! this shampoo.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! It produces enough lather, smells wonderfully, and cleans thoroughly without leaving a trace of residue. It&#x27;s far superior than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve used, which justifies the premium price it charges. I LOVE this shampoo!</li>
    <li> I only used this product twice before seeing results. My scalp was itching and my hair was oily,,,since it&#x27;s also color treated I&lt;br /&gt;was hesitant to use anything that would be harsh. This shampoo is perfect! The smell is light &amp; clean, suds up great, leaves my&lt;br /&gt;hair soft &amp; silky. But best of all I suddenly realized my itchiness was gone along with the excess oil in my hair!! This shampoo&lt;br /&gt;is the best!! I use it once or twice during the week alternating with my usual shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have severe autoimmune disease. I have &amp;#34;attacks&amp;#34; which lead to extremely dry hair that falls out if I just touch it, but my scalp feels oily &amp; breaks out under all that dry, frizzy hair. I was desperately trying to find a shampoo that would help with both issues. I was afraid to try anything &amp; make my symptoms worse. This shampoo was described as being &amp;#34;natural.&amp;#34; It listed several botanical ingredients. I held my breath, ordered it, got it quickly, used it, &amp; it lived up to its advertising. My scalp felt clean, the bumps seemed to have calmed down, and when I ran a wide-tooth comb thru it, I didn&#x27;t get a handful of hair falling out into the sink. My hair felt soft &amp; conditioned without feeling greasy. I am delighted &amp; grateful. Thank You!</li>
    <li> I just got this shampoo yesterday and used it for the first time last night and already love it. Normally by mid-day the next day my hair would already start feeling greasy but I doesn&#x27;t - YAY. I can&#x27;t say I love the smell but I combine it w/ the Silk18 Natural Conditioner which smells amazing. If I am this happy in just one use, I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term benefits! It is a little pricey for the size of the bottle BUT natural products usually are....I am willing to spend a little more for something natural, especially if it does exactly what I wanted it to do!</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo with or without conditioner, and in both cases my hair got super dry and brittle. It was very difficult to comb my hair. This seems like a very harsh shampoo. Also, I did not see any improvement in the itchy problem. Maybe it does wonders for some people, but sadly not for me.</li>
    <li> I love natural products and really wanted to try this one. It felt good, not a lot of difference compared to my cheaper shampoo, but did make it a little less greasy. I needed conditioner with it. Pretty pricey especially for a college student.</li>
    <li> I used this product and I have to say that it is great. My hair not only looks good but feels good. This product works wonders and I would suggest it to anyone with difficult hair like mine.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo. I have very long fine hair. I have had oily scalp problems since I was little. At 54 I finally found a shampoo that actually cleans my scalp and hair without stripping it. This is the first shampoo I have ever used that has allowed me to skip a day of washing my hair if I need to.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this shampoo to anyone with fine oily hair and/or scalp acne, it has helped with that issue also.</li>
    <li> Post pregnancy the hormones go wacky leaving oily hair and causing hair loss. This product gets the oil&lt;br /&gt;out with out drying out your hair.</li>
    <li> I live in a hot and humid weather all year long and normally at the end of the day I feel my hair greasy, even though that I work most of the time in a conditioned office.  The situation of greasy hair can be worsened if I eat greasy food.  In my experience I can&#x27;t use conditioner or conditioner shampoo like Head&amp;Shoulder because my hair got too greasy and itchy at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the longer the hair the greasier the scalp, that is why I used to use shampoo like Selsun Blue but it is too strong and it makes the problem worse because after using it the hair is certainly clean and not greasy but I think it makes my scalp too dry and in an effort to normalize the situation it makes the pores produce more sebum and at the end of the day it is very oily and itchy; besides it makes my hair dull and more difficult to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found this shampoo to be good at controlling the situation cleaning but not making the scalp dry and it feels a normal hair again, also my hair remains conditioned so I can manage it normally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to control oily hair and/or scalp I do recommend you this product.</li>
    <li> It works great. I&#x27;m a guy with somewhat thin hair and it&#x27;s oily in the morning. My hair has more volume, less oily and much smoother.  I was a little hessitant about the smell but my girlfriend loves it.</li>
    <li> And I LOVE pizza. So just like pizza&#x27;s my favorite food, Maple Holistics is my favorite company. I love it love it LOVE IT!!!! 5 Stars to the moon, baby!</li>
    <li> This shampoo has been so great for my hair.  Conventional shampoos and conditioners flattened out my hair and made my hair very oily very quickly.  This shampoo has given me more volume and allowed me to not wash my hair more than once a day due to oiliness.  Also, my hair used to fall out so much that I grew worried, which is how I found maple holistics.  My hair is so shiny and healthy looking that I get compliments all the time.  Thank you so much for my healthy hair!</li>
    <li> I ordered this shampoo from Amazon, and used it for about 4 weeks before writing this review.  I have very straight, fine, Asian hair, and generally wash my hair once every 2 days.  I would say that it&#x27;s been very effective at reducing the itchiness of my scalp, which was my main reason for purchasing this shampoo.  In addition, I feel that this shampoo makes my scalp feel very clean, but not overly tight and dry like regular grocery store shampoos that I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hesitant to give a 5-star review until I use it for a longer period of time, and also because of it&#x27;s high price, but so far so good.  If you have similar problems with an itchy scalp, I would definitely suggest giving this shampoo a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on my experience this past month, I&#x27;ll continue to use this shampoo at least for a few more months -- my hope is that after a few months of scalp-training, I&#x27;ll be able to extend the time between washing to every 3-4 days, but right now my hair still gets a little greasy by the end of the second day (though I live in a pretty hot and humid area, so this might have some effect).</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a long time now, usually switching it up with the other Shampoos this company offers. It does it&#x27;s magic. I&#x27;ve been suffering from dry scalp for awhile now, and it&#x27;s probably one of the only things I would love to cure about myself. This makes me feel safe, using a product that&#x27;s fully organic and doesn&#x27;t have any of the harmful chemicals that most store brand shampoos use. Just be sure to pick up a nice conditioner to go along with it, probably something that promotes natural oils as well.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item based on reviews that claimed it would improve my dry itchy scalp.  After multiple uses as directed I have found this item to be of no help with my scalp.  I give it  2 stars because is does clean well and smells ok.  I deducted stars for  the lack of help with my scalp, the increased shedding I experienced with it, and the high price.  Overall, I would not recommend this product to anyone who wishes to alleviate the dryness or itchiness of there scalp.  If someone is seeking a shampoo for oily hair I would say use with caution if you are concerned with shedding and don&#x27;t expect this shampoo to extend the time between shampoos.</li>
    <li> I have hair that hangs to my waist (no small feat, given that I&#x27;m 5&#x27;9) and when it comes to hair products, I&#x27;ve poked at them all. Eventually I learned it wasn&#x27;t about what color the product was, what the bottle said, how many commercials or ads they had - it was about whether it worked or not. Up until now, I&#x27;d been relying on Suave for shampoo and Wen for conditioner - an odd couple, but they worked for me. I was asked to try this stuff, and I&#x27;m glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells very strongly of herbals, the medicinal sort, not the perfumed variety, but it&#x27;s still pleasant and full of Rosemary. It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;foam up\\&quot; because it&#x27;s sulfate free, but it really does get oil the heck off of your scalp, which is a godsend if you&#x27;ve been struggling with it for years like I have. For the first time in a long time, I feel like my scalp is really and truly clean without feeling like a pile of straw - no itchiness or irritated skin and my \\&quot;scalp hair\\&quot; is soft to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have longer hair and issues with an oily scalp, I can say from experience that Degrease shampoo really does work to get rid of excess oil and keep your hair soft at the same time. Give it a shot if you&#x27;re curious - it&#x27;s a heck of a product.</li>
    <li> Very Disappointed with this product I washed my hair and followed what the bottle said and my hair was oily not 5 hours later. DUD!</li>
    <li> My hair/head feels VERY uncomfortable when I do not wash my hair. Hence, I try to wash it everyday even though I&#x27;ve been told by stylists that I should do it every other day (prevent hair shed, over drying my hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I came across Degrease, I decided to give it a try. It&#x27;s not the cheapest compared to over the counter shampoos, but  was reasonably price (in comparison to solution based shampoos at Sephora and Hair salons). For the first week, I used it every other day with the Degrease shampoo only. I found that it did a good job soaking up the oiliness on my scalp, and I did not have the urge to scratch my head uncontrollably.  My hair also had that really &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; feeling. But that squeaky clean feeling also meant that my hair did not feel soft.. It felt flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the second week, I added conditioner on top of the Degrease shampoo. I did not purchase Maple Holistic&#x27;s conditioner, so I used Pantene. I felt that adding on conditioner really helped give my hair a softer feel. I would recommend Degrease if you have itchy oily scalp, but I would suggest adding on a good conditioner to keep your hair balanced out. I have yet to try Maple Holistic&#x27;s conditoiner, so hopefully a shampoo/conditioner pairing of their product will work out.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel it is very good comparing with the same price of other sampoo~</li>
    <li> My husband suddenly got acne all over his head so I bought this shampoo for him. After a week he still got those acne on him but he doesn&#x27;t feel the itchy anymore. There is light herbal smells that is not too overpower but I guess he doesn&#x27;t mind what his hair smells like.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been embarrassed about my oily hair since I was a teenager.  I had to wash my hair every day and sometimes twice a day.  Now I don&#x27;t have that awful oily hair smell in the mornings.  I&#x27;m so relieved!  I believe that my scalp is much healthier and that this shampoo DOES stimulate the follicles for better hair growth.  I love the smell and how my scalp feels when I apply it.  Thank you so much for an amazing product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super picky about my shampoo and conditioner. I always buy salon brands but I find that half way through an expensive bottle the product isn&#x27;t as effective and often leaves my hair very greasy and dandruff. I came across this company on amazon and decided to give it a try. I just love this shampoo. Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily or greasy. Works great with the silk18 natural conditioner also by maple holistics. Also it lasts a long time as you do not need to use a whole lot. Will definitely order again once I&#x27;m all out.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has changed my life. I had searched for years to find a shampoo that actually gave me volume without exchanging it for moisture. This shampoo works to extend the amount of time before my hair gets greasy, and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair dry or frizzy. This is seriously a miracle product and I recommend it to anyone with hair that is greasy and/or lifeless!!</li>
    <li> I have very itchy greasy hair. I mean literally even right after washing it it&#x27;s itchy. I have tried everything, head and shoulders made my hair greasy as well. I used it for such a long time but it did nothing to my hair, the dandruff was still there and the grease was still there. This product is great, it is very invigorating to the senses, it does tingle a bit, and feels so beneficial on the scalp. It makes my scalp feel so refreshed, and when usually washing my hair twice a day in the summer or once a day, I can finally relax knowing that this product is around allowing me to skip several shampoos about two days which for me is a miracle. It was rare to find a product suitable for oily itchy scalp since most products out there are made for itchy DRY scalp, so I always thought I had issues, but thank you Maple Holistics for this product. I will keep purchasing this product. My life is definitely changed and now I can go out there and feel so much better about myself.</li>
    <li> I absolutely hate washing my hair every day. Although if I don&#x27;t, on the second day people ask me why I left the house with my hair wet :/ the oil is just getting worse &amp; worse as I get older. This shampoo has helped me to save time on washing my hair every day AND not look like I just got out of the pool! It is expensive but since I wash my hair less often it kind of evens out. I do wish it was sold in bigger bottles though</li>
    <li> This is the most outstanding product for those ladies who have uncontrollable frizz hair. The hair that gets frizzy once it receives the humidity of the air. This is the one product that can control all of your frizzy tips. It will as well leave your hair looking very long and smooth. Your hair will bounce as you walk down the street. The shampoo and the conditioner together will make you hair look full of volume and thick as well. The Vitamin H and Protein silk are the main two ingredients that help the hair look at the best than it can. Having the most wonderful hair if most of what a girl as wished for. Most of the women are tired of having nappy, knotty, and frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;I always tried looking for that one product that was able to control my frizzy hair, was able to make it look like those television female hair models. Nothing worked! I tried everything that I could. I just wanted my hair to be smooth and soft. The very first time I used the Degrease my hair had never felt so soft before. Not only did it last the day but it as well lasted until the second day, perhaps even longer. My hair looked long, shiny, and smooth. I was able to run my fingers through my hair as if it were a waterfall. Not only that but my hair seemed as if I straighten it but it was the natural look that this product gave me. I have never been happier with a product result, with this one being an exception. Sometimes when I go back home for the weekend I can&#x27;t shower unless it&#x27;s this exact same product that I&#x27;m using because other shampoos just make my hair frizzy and stay in knots. Also can I mention how much we females dislike dandruff that other shampoos leave us? Well not this one, this is also another advantage of using this product. I honestly have no negative feedback to give about this product.&lt;br /&gt;There have been many people that have complimented my hair in fact. I always receive the compliments whether I straighten my hair or if it&#x27;s naturally like that and I&#x27;m very gladto respond by saying that it&#x27;s my natural hair, that I just showered. Recently I went to the beach to surf on the weekend; once I got out of the water and my hair was dry I got asked another question that made me glad. I was asked by a lady what product I use on my hair because it looked as if I didn&#x27;t even go to the beach. Once again I was really astonished that I could say that I don&#x27;t use anything. Not to mention that I have dyed my hair three times in the last year! This product is what makes my hair look undamaged! I can&#x27;t believe that I have dyed my hair three different colors and I was able to find a product that is color protected. Again, this shampoo of course isn&#x27;t labeled color protected its labeled smooth and silky! This is why I got it! This is how I use the shampoo, I shower with warm water at first, shampoo, and then when I condition I use the conditioner mainly on my tips, a little touch of it before touching my roots and then I rinse in cold fresh water. I would have to give this product a full 5 star rating, if there was more I would. This product is ridiculously magical.&lt;br /&gt;Ladies if you want a magical miracle that finally makes your hair look like the hair from the television models this is it! Don&#x27;t look back on other pages for other products this one really does work and I&#x27;m just an ordinary, eighteen years old, college student. Also remember that this product doesn&#x27;t cost a whole lot like other salon products. It is very economically for anyone that wants soft, smooth, and silky hair. I was finally able to find a product that gives the best results ever. Come one ladies, click the button &amp;#34;add to cart&amp;#34; along by purchasing the conditioner. You won&#x27;t regret it. Once you do that, next time your online to look other shampoo products don&#x27;t forget to rebuy this special one.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo and the Silk 18 conditioner about a month ago. Initially, I thought it was making my scalp break out. But I believe similar to breaking out after a facial, my scalp purged all the sebum &amp; buildup. Now my scalp feels calm, my hair feels clean yet silky and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;The negative aspects are the price and the availability. I am going through the bottles pretty quickly and although I think the product is great, I think a coupon code for buying multiple bottles or a discounted larger bottle would make sense. How can I know if these products are miracle workers if I can&#x27;t afford to keep using it? Salon size bottles of Redken shampoo/conditioner are cheaper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and it really works. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with oily hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had oily hair and have never found a shampoo that can handle it like this one!  I can skip a day of shampooing and my hair does not look greasy.  My hair and scalp look and feel healthier - particularly since I don&#x27;t have to shampoo as often.  The shampoo has a nice scent too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had oily hair, scalp, and face and it seemed to get worse over the years.  By age 25 I started noticing oil would creep down my forehead during the day and my face would be oily by the end of the work day -- my forehead was shiny and I looked like I was sweating.  By age 30 the oil would start irritating my eyes and contact lenses so bad that I would need to wash my face when I got home from work.  By age 35 I needed to wash my face at work during the day, usually shortly around lunchtime.  I would wash my face again before going to bed and my skin and hair would get oily during the night and darken my pillowcase.  Gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured I had no choice but shower more often.  And I could never find shampoo made for oily hair in the stores.  My wife said I should try a more expensive shampoo.  Recently I searched online and found this product.  I&#x27;m not in love with the smell but have used it for roughly one month and have noticed a significant improvement.  I shower every morning, using regular shampoo for the first wash and this shampoo for the second wash, allowing it to sit on my head for 2-3 minutes then rinse.  My hair is less greasy and it has improved my oily skin, so much that most days I don&#x27;t need to wash my face at all until late evening.  I do not use a conditioner.  I&#x27;ve tried using this shampoo for both washes everyday, but haven&#x27;t noticed any difference, so I&#x27;m continuing to use my original shampoo to make this last longer.  I also haven&#x27;t noticed much improvement with my itchy scalp, but that&#x27;s not a major concern for me.  Try it, maybe it will work for you.</li>
    <li> I have very very oily hair and scalp this shampoo did a great job in getting my hair cleaned,should they add more natural ingredients and getting off some of the chemicals there,I would like to see that happening..Overall it cleanses very well!</li>
    <li> My family is always looking for good quality products that don&#x27;t have all those harsh chemicals. After reading several reviews I decided to purchase degrease because it had everything that my family is looking for. My daughter is going through hormonal changes and has really greasy hair and really bad dandruff. After using it once her hair looked amazing. My husband also is dealing with with hair loss and he constantly struggles folliculitis, an infection of the hair follicle. This product has all the things we are looking for to solve our problems. We all love the smell and we are all very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from hair lost for years. I bought every kind of shampoo without considering its price but none of them worked on me. Finally I decided to buy this one and when I used this shampoo for the first time I realized that my scalp itchiness subsided for the first time. Not only did it help my scalp, my hair looks and feels amazing! I&#x27;ve used many other products but have never gotten results like this from other products. It has a wonderful fragrance and is very concentrated. It&#x27;s well worth the high price!</li>
    <li> great shampoo for problematic scalp.leaves your hair soft and shiny.highly recommended</li>
    <li> Love how it works for my hair which tends to be oily.</li>
    <li> love love love this product and use it exclusively now -- on my fourth bottle. I have always been frustrated by my oily hair AND itchy scalp -- it seems like you should only have one or the other! and I was always annoyed that every shampoo in the drug store seemed to be for dry hair. if I used head &amp; shoulders for my itchy scalp it would make my hair flat and oily after a couple hours. I love having bangs but always ended up pinning them back mid-morning because they just got oily and gross. this stuff is worth every penny. my scalp never itches and my hair looks good all day. also, for those who are acne prone, this stuff won&#x27;t make you break out around your hairline. love that it is natural. expensive, but one bottle lasts a couple of months even with daily use. you wear your hair every day, so I think it is a great investment if you are tired of dealing with oily hair. buying in bulk right now!</li>
    <li> This is a very good shampoo for oily hair. It doesn&#x27;t control the oil 100%, but it helps. I wish they had a light weight conditioner for oily hair that matched.</li>
    <li> I am 36 years old, and asian.  Every day I have a problem with dandruff in my hair more than 30 years. My head is itching to death because of dandruff. I have tried a lot of shampoo. They do not help my problem. Finally, by google, I found this product from  Maple Holistics. It works very well. I can not say it solved my problem permanently, but I would like to say it solved my problem more than 90%. That is why I came back to purchase it again. Furthermore, it has least negative effects on my head skin. Thank you !</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this shampoo for oily hair.  I tried every anti-dandruff shampoo out there but nothing worked.  My hairline was also breaking out pretty severely.  This is the only thing that helped.  Now my skin has cleared up and so has my dandruff.  I guess my real problem was really greasy hair that was causing dandruff.  This also lathers incredibly well yet contains no sulfates.  The smell is wonderful.  I&#x27;m super critical too!</li>
    <li> Today was the first day of using this shampoo and it surprisingly felt so gentle to my scalp and hair. I expected it to be more drying to get rid of the oiliness in the hair. It has been a pleasure using this shampoo so far and will continue to monitor the effectiveness over time.</li>
    <li> I am 36 years old and had my second daughter at 34; after that pregnancy I was left with oily skin (breaking out like crazy, especially in the neck area) and oily hair. And when I say &amp;#34;oily hair&amp;#34; is an understatement, I had a patch of grease at the top of my head that wouldn&#x27;t go away, even when I was washing it I could feel the grease just lying there. I used everything I found on the web: vinegar, Listerine, I even dyed it to get it to dry somehow. Nothing worked. Finally I decided to go to a dermatologist, very recognized office in my area (Germantown, TN), and the doctor recommended chemical peeling for the face and regular Head and Shoulders for the hair. She told me that my neck breaking out was because of the products that I was using on my hair. She then directed me to get rid of anything I had for my hair (Kerastase, Caviar, Framesi, etc. you get the idea, expensive stuff) and to use only the H&amp;S Classic Clean Shampoo. Because the hair thing didn&#x27;t work I went to my gynecologist because I was sure it was something hormonal and related to my last pregnancy. She run all tests and found nothing. I was really desperate... until I tried this product. After three washes the oily patch disappear, by the fifth wash my hair looked as healthy as before my pregnancy. Every summer since I buy the degrease shampoo because I know that the oil will come back with heat. I use it a couple of times during the week and never, ever, have I seen the grease return.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works great for oily hair.  I found this after trying to make my own natural shampoo which was a failure.  This product works well and I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I am working in the kitchen and the garage a lot of time so I have greasy hair to look forward to by the end of the day. This thing really degreases my hair so that I can sleep at night feeling fresh.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful shampoo for my needs. I have a bit of complex regarding my hair and I have mistreated my hair so much that it&#x27;s become crazy damaged and it has always become greasy by the end of the day. I may have had abused it to style it during the past years. Trying to reverse the damage with this, and I can see that this has good benefits for myhair.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot it so far, it&#x27;s really doing wonders at preventing a greasy scalp so far, i&#x27;ve only used it twice (if only I could get rid of my oily facial skin lol). My only complaint so far is that i&#x27;m not sure how good it is for my hair and...does it contain a variation on Sodium Laurel Sulphate? I saw a bunch of chemicals on the back I didn&#x27;t like the look of but then again i&#x27;m not a chemist and can&#x27;t comment on the ingredients too much.  I should add, I did follow the shower tips card. I use a small amount (it gets really foamy and does seem to go a long way) once and then wash it out in warm water (not hot), then repeat the process. Then I also end up making sure that I blast my head with cold water at the end of my shower and then letting my hair air dry for a bit afterwards.  Getting rid of the Oily Scalp though - very nice.  I will update after sometime.  *****UPDATE 18/7/15 *****  So far so good, nice for getting rid of oily scalp, hair doesn&#x27;t feel as easy to deal with afterwards.  Also got updated by the Maple Holistics team, there are no sulphates in this product at all according to them.  Will do another update once I try out the conditioner they recommended to me (which was the &amp;#34; Silk18 Natural Conditioner&amp;#34;). I hope it doesn&#x27;t re-grease my degreased scalp.  lol</li>
    <li> I really do enjoy testing out products for my body.  To see what works, the benefits, and the drawbacks.  I was looking for a shampoo to address the sebum build up and my itchy scalp because my prior shampoo was just making everything worse.  After my first wash, my hair felt great, my scalp was clean and refreshed and no itching at all!  While using this product, my job was to sanitize laboratory equipment.  That means there is a ton of alcohol being sprayed around my hair.  With this shampoo I was able to clean the sweat and oil that built up from working, and at the same time restore my alcohol frizzed hair to balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the scent and exciting went ahead and purchased another bottle so I could have no delay in my routine.  I quit my the lab job and continued to use the same routine and found the shampoo to actually dry my scalp and hair more than usual.  The itching came to a point where I had to shampoo  twice a day to relieve it.  I wasn&#x27;t even all the way through with the first bottle and now I reluctantly had a second bottle sitting around.  Maybe my scalp grew accustomed to the formula.  Their email support suggested it was a change of seasons, but I started using the shampoo in October till February and the winter didn&#x27;t seem to have any effect all those months.  Needless to say, I kindly requested Maple Holistics to stand by their satisfaction guarantee and send me another bottle of a different formula.  After a long wait between emails, they stood by their claim and told me to provide an address where they will send me the new shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve still yet to see any bottle in my mailbox and that was back in February....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my customer experience was a little better in handling my issue I would have enjoyed this shampoo a lot more.  I would love to try out one of their other formulas, however the price is a bit steep to take the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE 06/26/14:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maple Holistics support contacted me and apologized for the previous mishap.  They sent me another bottle of Degreaser and their Sage Shampoo right away.  This interaction was with a different support member and much better than my previous experience.  I&#x27;m now testing their Sage shampoo every other day and will produce a review of that when I feel I gathered enough data.</li>
    <li> My wife just sprayed my hair with something and I had a hard time removing it (it was some hairpsray that was too old or something) Good thing I had this in stock because I always have greasy hair. Removed hairspray too.</li>
    <li> Searched for years for a product that would control the buildup on my scalp.  Nothing worked.  Products either did nothing or made the problem worse.  This product is truly amazing.  After one application, my scalp is clear of the buildup and there is no itching.  Only time will tell if this result continues.  I&#x27;m not sure yet how often the product will be necessary to use, but if the results continue to be this good, I will apply as often as necessary.  I wish I had found this product years ago.</li>
    <li> I have already ordered my second bottle. Before my hair would get oily within a day but now it takes 2-3 days. Good product!</li>
    <li> I have tried several shampoos to help get rid of the build up in my hair and this is the first shampoo that has worked! I have extremely oily hair and even after a day of not washing, it looks greasy and wet. With this shampoo, I can use it daily or every few days, and it makes my hair feel light and smooth. It never makes my hair feel too dry and it even works well with my highlighted hair. I am so thankful I found this product!</li>
    <li> I never know what to buy on Amazon sometimes which is why I&#x27;m writing my very real review, to hopefully help someone with my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways about this very effective product:&lt;br /&gt;It helped to get my oily, itchy, and smelly scalp under control and got rid of any dandruff I had. My scalp has been producing too much sebum and nothing has helped until this shampoo. I use a shampoo brush to massage and stimulate my scalp when applying this product. After I rinse I use 3 minute miracle strong by Aussie. I feel it locks in moisture and makes my hair soft and silky without making it oily(because I&#x27;ve got enough of that). I&#x27;ve noticed when I don&#x27;t use any conditioner, the next day my scalp becomes very oily, I guess to make up for lack of conditioning. Also I use the tea tree oil lotion my Paul Mitchell. It feels really nice and also doesn&#x27;t make my scalp oily but locks in moisture. This routine has been working well for me. And I definitely couldn&#x27;t do it without this shampoo. It works!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s helped with my flaky scalp and my husband even uses it on his beard. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I used it and liked it the first time i used it. I will get more and recommend it my friends</li>
    <li> very helpful for my hair</li>
    <li> If you have extremely oily hair like mine, and by that I mean you wash it in the morning and by the afternoon it is oily again, this shampoo is amazing! PLUS, it has a pleasing scent to it...I&#x27;m so glad I found this and I have gotten all of my family to switch to this brand! Yay! Great stuff...well worth a try!</li>
    <li> This shampoo works amazing... I tried it a few month&#x27;s ago.. Now it&#x27;s the only shampoo i use</li>
    <li> I love this product! It works just as it is described and I have not had to wash my normally greasy hair everyday. It has also eliminated the dry skin on my scalp.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous &amp;#34;salon &amp;#34; tea tree oil shampoos for oily hair.Never worked.This product is AWESOME!!  Our friend let us try theirs while on vacation can&#x27;t wait to try all maple holistic products Can go two days with out washing. smells great .Cleared up dandruff too&lt;br /&gt;  Cindy</li>
    <li> This shampoo noticeably leaves my hair less greasy by the end of the next day. In addition it gives my hear more volume compared to other shampoos.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over two week and I noticed a change; my hair is less oiled and healthier. The shampoo has a very fresh smell. Delivery was on time and customer service was good. I will recommend this product</li>
    <li> Your product is my absolute favorite shampoo. The smell is not horrible and it does the job. My daughter and I have extremely greasy hair and we used to have to wash our hair at least 1x a day and sometimes 2x a day because it was so oily greasy and dandruff was horrible. Now we can go and use this shampoo up to 2x a week and then use regular shampoo the rest of the week if we do need to shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for such a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is the price ;)</li>
    <li> I have been searching for years for a shampoo that not only helps with exceptionally greasy hair, but also scalp acne and itching.  I&#x27;ve been using this for months now and I can say it has improved my scalp and greatly reduced the oil. I also have no more itching! This is the happiest I&#x27;ve been with my hair in years.  I also use their Tea Tree Shampoo for Moderate Dandruff a few times a week and my hair feels and looks 100% better.  I will never go back to store bought shampoos again as long as they continue to make these. Please keep making these! XD  I can&#x27;t recommend this shampoo enough!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after reading some of the reviews. I always had oily hair and it gets itchy by the end of the day. My hair is neither too severely oily nor itchy but I thought I could normalize my scalp with this shampoo. After the first use there was not improvement but I kept using it for few more weeks but the only thing it changed was my hair texture. I have a fairly healthy shiny hair but after using this product it became brittle and super dry! I never really have to comb my hair because it never really gets tangled. After the use of this shampoo I have to constantly apply products to smooth it out because I get big tangles everywhere. Bad product!</li>
    <li> Not bubble, very sticky. I hate it</li>
    <li> I bought this for my tween daughter whose scalp was breaking out.  It began working immediately, and after three uses, her scalp is nearly healed.  I wanted to concentrate the shampoo on her scalp rather than her hair, so I put the product into a salon applicator bottle with a pointed tip.  This shampoo is super concentrated, so a little goes a long way.  I added water to the applicator bottle to cut down on waste.  For a shampoo as deep-cleansing as this is, I found that it doesn&#x27;t seem excessively drying to the hair, yet it does a great job of cleaning the scalp.  We follow through with a leave-in conditioner, focusing on the lengths of her hair and avoiding her scalp.</li>
    <li> Really great product! Love it! Keep hair fresh!</li>
    <li> I could finally find a shampoo that is for oily hair and scalp. This shampoo is amazing. I have ordered two bottles of it so far. The first time I ordered it, the shampoo itself was quite thin and watery so I ran out of the bottle quickly but the next time I ordered it, it was much more thicker thus lasting me longer. The order was also shipped and delivered on time. Very happy with the purchase and definitely recommend it to people with oily hair and scalp.</li>
    <li> To give a little background on my hair first: ever since puberty hit, I&#x27;ve had very oily hair. I HAVE to wash my hair everyday. Within 24 hours, my hair is all oily and gross. I&#x27;ve tried maybe a few different kinds of shampoo in the hopes of fixing it, but they were all drying type of shampoos that think if you strip your hair of all oils that it goes away, and it just makes it worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, on to the review: I bought this shampoo around 2 weeks ago or so. It is summer here, in NC, and I also live near the coast, so the humidity is horrible. I sweat a lot, and when I wipe my face, it tends to get in my hair, which overtime gives the effect of greasy hair. That being said, I obviously haven&#x27;t tried this shampoo out when I&#x27;m not sweating a lot, so that may have some effect on how it&#x27;s working with my oil issues. It doesn&#x27;t or hasn&#x27;t so far, made me be able to go a second day without washing my hair. As I sit here and type this, my hair is all oily and gross, but I washed my hair at 5:30 am yesterday morning, and I did sweat a lot yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, however that it does get your hair squeaky clean. You can hear it squeak in the shower. I have hair down to my elbows and you only need a quarter sized amount to wash your hair. You only need to wash your scalp, not the rest of your hair. Everytime I get in the shower and squirt the quarter sized amount in my hair, I always think &amp;#34;I need more.&amp;#34; I just take a little on my finger tips and start massaging it on various parts of my hair. I scrub the back of my head towards my neck, cause it gets really itchy if I don&#x27;t wash it everyday. This shampoo lathers so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read another review on here about how a lady who had horrible cystic acne would use it as face wash as well. I&#x27;ve been doing that too, seeing as how I have an oily face too. It hasn&#x27;t changed anything with that yet either, except that if I do have any acne come up, it heals it a lot faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mainly got thisshampoo because it is silicone and sulfate free. I saw a girl on youtube talk about how silicone weighs your hair down and essentially creates frizz. I have frizzy curly hair, and wanted to see if it helped. I haven&#x27;t been able to wear my hair down yet straight from the shower to see if it helps, but I can see a difference when I take my hair down in the mornings before I wash it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I follow this shampoo with the Silk 18, and I will say this: the conditioner smells amazing. I tell my friends that it smells like the good vanilla, not the nasty car air freshener vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking that maybe I just need to wait until fall/autumn is here, when I don&#x27;t sweat as much, and I&#x27;ve really had the chance to see if it works like it&#x27;s supposed to, maybe my sebaceous gland needs more repair than normal? I don&#x27;t know. I will update in a few months or so and give you the low down on it then too.</li>
    <li> I have been trying a sample of this shampoo. I did a lot of research on organic shampoo products and discovered Maple Holistics. This shampoo smells very good and fresh and seems to be working well for my hair. I love knowing all of the natural ingredients that go into my hair when I shampoo. It works very well at taking the grease out of my hair, and once my hair is dry, it feels pretty soft. I like how my hair feels and smells after using this shampoo and how well it lathers my hair.  I would definitely recommend trying this shampoo and seeing if it works for you!</li>
    <li> I have VERY oily hair that is completely lifeless and gross 4-6 hours after most shampoos. This is the only one I have tried that makes or bearable for me to only wash my hair once a day. Worth the steep price because a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have long suffered from oily hair. My hair type is straight and fine...and now thinning. If shampooed in the morning, I am usually good for most of the day, however, if in windy conditions or driving in a convertible, the oil production seems to accelerate and my hair is oily by evening. It&#x27;s certainly oily by the next morning. A few weeks ago I started shampooing Monday, Wednesday and Friday in hopes of lessening the oil production on my scalp that I have read is accelerated by too frequent washing. I was sharing this dilemma with a friend and she gave me a little bit of this shampoo to try. I had enough for two applications, and after the second one(still skipping days) I noticed my hair was definitely less oily on the day after I had shampooed it than it was previously.  I am looking forward to getting my own bottle and will report back after extended usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 6.11.2014&lt;br /&gt;Scored my own bottle and have been using it for over a month. For the first week, I found that I had to use it daily. I shampooed twice per shower with a quarter size amount each time. The bottle said to shake, but it is so thick, it doesn&#x27;t seem to actually mix very well. The bottle is almost opaque so it is hard to tell. I give it a few shakes then wash and rinse once. The second wash I leave on while I continue with my shower. I rinse it off at the end, which will allow it to have set for 3-5 minutes. During the first week my scalp was tingling and while less oily, it looked the same dry as it had before I started using the product and the next morning I felt as if I had to wash again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after the first week or so, I woke up one day and my hair looked great! I kid you not. Fuller in appearance and not oily or weighed down. Not as great as the same day wash , but easily good enough for me to not have to wash it again, which really is a first for as long as I can remember. I wash Mon-Wed-Fri now 2x during each shower. The second wash creates noticeably more suds. If the first wash ever gets to that point, I will try to get by with one wash per shower as the product is pricey and rare (you can&#x27;t just buy it in the neighborhood grocery store). But for me and my particular hair type/scalp it is the best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Degrease shampoo for 2 weeks, and I notice there is a huge difference from before. It cleans up the excess oiliness meanwhile remains the moisture. Would like to recommend to others who have oily and greasy hair!</li>
    <li> Despite daily shampooing, my daughter had greasy, waxy hair.  This product made a huge difference.</li>
    <li> I Never write reviews, but I couldn&#x27;t stay quiet about this product! I LOVE it! I have had oily hair for years and nothing has work. I finally search for a product and this came up. I read a lot of reviews until I was convinced and bought it, I&#x27;m glad I did. This is really a miracle in a bottle! I had problems with the delivery, but it was worth it! I will be purchasing this product from now on! By the way, it smells amazing :)</li>
    <li> It definitely takes more than a few uses to finally keep your grease at bay. I&#x27;m hoping that the longer that I use it, it will get even better. I definitely notice a difference the next day. It&#x27;s still a little greasy and obviously gets worse as the day goes on..but I can really feel the difference in the texture of my hair on top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I like this product so far. Plus, the bottle is high quality with an easy cap.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s begin with my hair type. I have long dirty blonde hair (past my shoulders about 1/3 down my back) and it is thick thanks to my Italian blood. I love my hair but I hate how weighed down and greasy it gets after only one day. I just felt like no matter what shampoo I used my hair was never really clean. I bought this brand on a why not kind of whim and was honestly surprised at how small the bottle was. I have long hair, i am used to using a lot of shampoo! I read the directions and kind of laughed at the &amp;#34;quarter size&amp;#34; amount it suggested but I decided to do exactly as it said the first try. Surprisingly, the quarter size amount was enough! The first wash it only really suds a little and I didn&#x27;t notice any tingling so I left it on for three min like it suggests then rinsed and got my quarter size amount again. Second time my hair suds like crazy! I mean, hair stand up on your head giant ball of suds crazy. I waited the three min again then rinsed and decided to skip conditioner just to see what happens. That is where we lost a star. I wish this product conditioned a little or had a conditioner made to match because my hair was a kind of a hassle to get though. HOWEVER, my hair felt TEN TIMES LIGHTER. It was like I had gotten 4 inches chopped off. I couldn&#x27;t believe it! The next time I showered the same thing happened and it felt lighter again except this time I made sure to condition my ends. All in all, awesome. Gets the gunk out and you wont have that greasy, oily, itchy shine start to come for two or so days which is about when to shampoo again anyway! I will definitely buy this again and maybe I&#x27;ll try a few of the conditioners.</li>
    <li> It does keep your hair cleaner for an extra 2 days, but as far as growth I haven&#x27;t noticed anything happening, I  have been using it for a month now, wanted to wait for a few weeks before I gave my opinion.</li>
    <li> I like some was  worried that in order to get the oily hair taken care, I would have to give up a pleasant smelling shampoo. Even the on the label it says degreaser. the shampoo works. I no longer have to wash my hair every day for it to look clean. It has a pleasant odor. Thanks</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift and i must say it is the best gift i have ever gotten. My hair type requires daily (sometimes twice daily) shampooing and I have tried so many different types of shampoo but it seemed like my hair was greasy looking and limp withing hours. With Degrease I can actually skip one sometimes two days of shampooing and my hair will still be light and oil free (the second day of nor shampooing it starts to get a bit oily). Before using this shampoo I also had mild seborrheic dermatitis and now i dont have to be embarrassed by having skin flakes in my hair! I would definitely recommend this to those who suffer from oily hair. With my next bottle i am planning on trying this on my face which also tends to be oily to see if it helps as much as it helped my hair!! Thank you maple holistics for creating such a great product!!</li>
    <li> This arrived last week, I have used it 4 times so far . Not seeing much difference in scalp health yet.&lt;br /&gt;It works well as a regular shampoo though.</li>
    <li> My daughters have oily scalps but dry hair and this shampoo is just wonderful.  Unfortunately, it is very expensive so we have to alternate with other products but it is gentle and effective on dandruff and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Works great, bought 2 more....wifey loved it</li>
    <li> My hair feels healthy and looks great after using this product for two months. I have very oily skin and consequently greasy hair and this shampoo has been perfect for my hair type. I am very happy with my purchase and have recommended it to a few friends and family member.</li>
    <li> i only need to use a few drops. i it has lasted me a while. i use apple cider vinegar as my conditioner. my hair is in better shape than it used to be.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, But when I tried it, right away I knew there was something different about this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;It smelt great and you could really feel a difference when applying.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> love this product it works really well on my hair. i havent found another product that works just as well as this one</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for a week and it works amazingly. It clears up all the buildups and doesn&#x27;t overdry my hair at all. I will definitely continue buying this.</li>
    <li> I was recommended by my hair stylist to try out this product because I sweat a lot and sometimes the gel I use tends to leave my hair a bit greasy. I used this shampoo and notice a difference. Also, not only is the shampoo effective it also smells great and don&#x27;t even need to use a lot. Even if it wasn&#x27;t a degrease shampoo, I would still buy it because of the fragrance that leaves your head smelling really good. I definitely recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> Recently I&#x27;ve noticed my scalp constantly becoming itchy, greasy, and occasionally flakey. I&#x27;ve just received this product and have tried it once. The shampoo solution has a great natural smell, but I have yet to obtain results. I will return back in a few weeks to update this review.</li>
    <li> Compared to what I was recently using for about a year (i.e., Arbonne and Trader Joe&#x27;s Tea Tree products), this product did an amazing job for my colored hair, but not my oily scalp condition.  This shampoo cleaned hair really well, but still gave hair gorgeous look. Without blowing the hair as instructed by Maple Holistics, I found it&#x27;s still very easy to arrange any style I wanted. Unfortunately, this product didn&#x27;t help with my oily scalp problem at all. To continue finding a perfect product, I probably try the Tea Tree one by Maple Holistics next time.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t quite what I expected. Looking for a product I can fall in love with. I&#x27;ll keep shopping around, hope I find what I am looking for.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try out the degrease shampoo as an alternative for when I want to switch things up with another maple holistics shampoo (sage).  The degrease shampoo did not dry out my hair, in fact, my hair was significantly shinier and softer - but unfortunately some flaking appeared.  It has a very pleasant aroma.  Perhaps it just didn&#x27;t suit my scalp.  I recommend this for anyone with scalp issues but without the severe flaking.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shampoo for his oily hair. We have ordered it twice now. He is very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have been using it for a few weeks now, and even on the days I don&#x27;t use it, my hair isn&#x27;t as greasy and my scalp less itchy. I have searched high and low for a shampoo that could help me for years! This is it. Will be ordering my second bottle soon.</li>
    <li> Just received this for my teen daughter yesterday.  We have tried multiple shampoos, including home made varieties...to combat her extra oily hair.  She was skeptical at first but after the first time using it, her hair..especially the crown area...was sooooo much more light and clean than I have seen her hair in many months!!!! We are very happy to have found a product that has made such a difference !!!!</li>
    <li> Thanks for this product! Clean my hair and has a good smell!</li>
    <li> Working fot tyhe greasy haired dad and son in the house.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with the scent of this shampoo. With any hair product, the first thing you notice is definitely the way it smells, and the smell of the Degrease Moisture Control is absolutely gorgeous. This shampoo contains lemon, rosemary, and basil, and that is definitely the smell that comes across. It&#x27;s a very herbal, soothing scent that reminds of the products used in nice spas. It&#x27;s odd - I find the scent relaxing at night thanks to the rosemary, and invigorating in the mornings thanks to the lemon. It&#x27;s such a unique, beautiful smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the scent alone isn&#x27;t why I adore this shampoo. While a lot of degrease shampoos leave hair incredibly dry, even when you follow up with a conditioner, this product leaves hair soft and vibrant. One of my biggest priorities when styling my hair is achieving volume at my roots, and this shampoo does an amazing job of that, even though it isn&#x27;t sold as a volumizer. However, by truly removing excess product build-up and oil at the scalp, it allows my hair to no longer be weighed down at the root, and to have a lot more volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo works a little differently than normal shampoos, and you have to make sure you read the directions, which tell you to let it sit on your scalp for about three minutes. It tingles a little bit, but by no means stings or irritates. My favorite trick when using this shampoo is to copy what stylists in salons do when they prepare your hair to be washed. Before you get in the shower, brush your hair thoroughly, and give yourself a light scalp massage with the pads of your fingers. This breaks up the oil and dirt at the roots and allows you to really thoroughly cleanse your scalp when you shampoo. Between using that trick and this shampoo, my scalp has never felt cleaner, and the health and vibrancy of my hair at the roots is absolutely stunning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is a perfect solution for anyone with an oily scalp. It&#x27;s incredibly effective, but also very gentle. My sister has a very dry hair type and no issues with oil at the roots, but she actually likes to borrow this as a once-a-week clarifying shampoo. I think it is perfect for that, and can be used to deeply cleanse the scalp, even for those who only need such a thorough cleansing once a week or month.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t feel like this got my hair clean, just made it dry. Nice natural smell, though.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I have oily hair since I am a teenager and nothing really worked before this one. I used to wash my hair every other day but now  I am able to wash them 2 or 3 times a week. You can feel your hair lighter during the first shampoo but it takes several months to be able to skip one day between two shampoos. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 22 year old male who has been plagued with dandruff since I was a child. It isn&#x27;t until recently however did I read that oily scalp could be a cause of flaking (who knew!). I noticed that my forehead would get very oily after a few hours post-shower and figured I would give this a go. Also, years of dandruff has caused me to have thinning hair. I was afraid of going bald.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this shampoo and I&#x27;m glad I did. Before trying this shampoo, my hair would only stay presentable for at most a single day. After sleep, it would become tangled and unmanageable. I paired this shampoo with castor oil treatment. Now, I only need to shampoo my hair every other day, and have noticed that my hair looks a lot better as well. I now always wake up with my hair looking good enough to go outside with the next day. Whether it&#x27;s the oil or the shampoo working, I also noticed that my bald/thinning spots are beginning to get more hair after a few weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very glad with the purchase although it&#x27;s somewhat pricey.</li>
    <li> The maple holistic shampoo for oily, itchy scalp was amazing. It didn&#x27;t fade my hair coloring and truly helps with itchy scalp. It&#x27;s a definite must have!</li>
    <li> it works exactly as advertised.  reduces excess oil in hair without making the hair too dry.  I will order more.</li>
    <li> I like the feeling of my hair after using this in the bath. This makes my hair very clean and soft, and there is a faint scent that makes me feel good.</li>
    <li> Used it the day I received it. Definitely &amp;#34;de-greased&amp;#34; my hair and removed the oil. Not to mention, it made my hair look fuller -- which is definitely a plus. However, after a nights sleep, hair went back to normal. It does still seem a bit fuller, but it was definitely not like a newly washed bed of hair. Will continue using this shampoo and will edit post accordingly after a while!</li>
    <li> I do have real oily hair, and a perpetually itchy scalp. No regular store-bought scalp/dandruff/oily hair shampoo has ever worked as the labels claim, and they all seem to be the same basic ingredients, mainly sodium laurel sulfate or another derivative. This particular brand didn&#x27;t make the itch go away completely but it made it more tolerable. It does have a strong aroma but not at all objectionable, and the tingling sensation gives me the impression something&#x27;s working. It&#x27;s fairly priced, spout doesn&#x27;t clog and I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> this is a great shampoo. i like the smell. i have tried a lot and this is one in my top five/.</li>
    <li> grease proof hair. makes my hair oil free and doesn&#x27;t let oil stay on my hair</li>
    <li> This shampoo is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for. Typical shampoos for oily hair still left that &amp;#34;build up&amp;#34; feeling. Hair feels clean but not dry. Biolage makes a similar product but with lots of chemicals. This one is all natural and smells great too. I look forward to trying other Maple Holistic products in the future.</li>
    <li> This is great for my hair because I used a lot of hair color and kind of damaged my hair a lot. This helps a lot with repairing and keeping my hair clean from my other hair products.</li>
    <li> Not expecting anything of it at first, when I started using this, I was quite surprised with the immediate result from using the product.  My hair would get so oily at the end of the day it felt so gross. However, after using this product, it definitely helped with the oiliness in my scalp. I would definitely continue using this and explore their other products as well!</li>
    <li> Like many, I&#x27;m sure, I  struggle with roots that are too greasy and ends that are a bit too dry. This shampoo is the best I&#x27;ve found in cutting the grease so that I can go 2-3 days without washing my hair (and washing hair everyday isn&#x27;t good!), without leaving the ends frazzled. This shampoo also really cuts the product build-up (hair sprays, serums, dry shampoo, etc), making my hair feel cleaner than when I wash with other shampoos. For all these reasons, this is my all-time favorite shampoo!</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with my purchase of this.</li>
    <li> Removes oil hair after a particularly hot day.</li>
    <li> degreasing my hair easily</li>
    <li> I think this is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever purchased. If you have greasy hair, this is a great shampoo.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the second time I buy this shampoo. Over the past years, the oil/greasy hair and itchy scalp has alway been bothering me. I used to wash my hair everyday, otherwise my hair would get pretty oil and scalp would also be very itchy. In addition, this problem seems to make my hair more easily lose. About four months ago, I bought this shampoo and tried it. In the begining, I didn&#x27;t find a big change for my oil hair. But after keep using it for a month, I find my hair not as oil as usual. Right now I just need to wash my hair every two days. My hair will get oil again in the third day, hopefully your company will make better shampoos for oil hair which make hair stay normal longer time.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this item is really good for my oil and itchy hair, and I&#x27;ll keep using it. If you have similar problem like me, I highly suggest you can also have a try.</li>
    <li> I purchase this product since Amazon had it listed as #1 in their rating for oily scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this for about 2 weeks and threw it out. It made my scalp really dry and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;I just got head and shoulders from local drug store and my scalp is doing much better now.</li>
    <li> I have oily hair and have to wash it every day if I&#x27;m going to wear it down. I have purchased several products to help with this issue. This shampoo is on the expensive side and the name seems to hit the nail on the head for what I need so I thought it would be worth the try. After using it several times I really can&#x27;t tell the difference. If I wash my hair at 6 am before work, (which is mostly sitting down so its not a sweaty day or anything) usually by 10 pm it&#x27;s starting to look borderline oily. By the time I sleep on it and morning comes it is defiantly oily. This was disappointing because for the price I really was looking for something to at least give me two days of oily free hair. I actually will probably switch back to a $7 shampoo that gave me better results (desert essence organics hair care shampoo) I can actually get a day and a half, maybe two out of this shampoo with 1 wash. I wish I could give a better review but based on the price vs results this just wasn&#x27;t ideal for me.</li>
    <li> Only used once. So far so good.</li>
    <li> Prior to trying this shampoo, my hair would get oily within 5 hours of being washed and within 24 hours look like it is soaked in oil. I tried about every remedy available. This is the first shampoo that worked. I instantly felt a difference and was able to go for 3 days without washing my hair. It smells naturally, herbally good ( no fake parfumey smell of drug store-bought shampoos, or stinky T-Gel). It also increased volume, added bonus! I love it!</li>
    <li> I really am thankful for this shampoo.  I&#x27;ve tried so many other shampoos specifically for oily scalp and they weren&#x27;t as effective as this at controlling my oily scalp.  I would have to wash my hair every day but with this I can go every other day.  Love this stuff.  Thanks so much.  I was beginning to think that nothing would ever help</li>
    <li> I have oily hair and have struggled to find a product that keeps my hair from getting oily throughout the day. This does the trick - even if I touch my hair or if it is windy. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> First, I will start by saying that I have been battling extremely greasy/oily hair since I&#x27;ve been a teenager. I have used almost every shampoo I could get my hands on cheap, expensive didn&#x27;t matter. My hair was always greasy a few hours after washing it, on a good day I could go almost half a day before it looked greasy. I typically wash my hair in the morning and by the end of the (work) day or around bed time my hair would be so greasy that if I were to go out I&#x27;d have to wash it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is hands-down amazing!! This is the ONLY shampoo that has ever worked for me. It has changed the texture of my hair (in a good way). Before using this my hair was, of course oily, but it was also fine and limp and now it is thicker and has volume and it is NOT greasy. I still have to wash my hair everyday but I think it&#x27;s more out of habit than necessity. I also learning that using organic oils on your hair/scalp slowly changes the ph in your scalp. So, I am confident that if I continue to use this shampoo I will be able to wash less often. I would recommend this product to anyone who has oily hair. I would love to try some of their other products because if they are as good as this shampoo I will love them, no doubt! They have made a lifetime customer out of me!!</li>
    <li> I have an extremely greasily scalp coupled with oily dandruff.  i can only keep my scalp in control if i shampoo exactly every 24 hours.  in addition, i shampoo twice every time i shower.  the only two other shampoos that i find effective to clean my scalp are DHC&#x27;s clarifying shampoo and nioxin&#x27;s shampoo for thinning hair (this nioxin actually works better than their formula made for dandruff.  i discovered this when i ran out of shampoo one day and had to use my husband&#x27;s).  i found the DHC one too stripping, and this would cause my scalp to get even more itchy.  the nioxin was causing too much hair growth - i have a lot of hair already, i&#x27;m obviously not their target group.  i also was looking for something more natural.  on a random search on amazon for oily scalp shampoo, i came across maple holistic&#x27;s degreasing shampoo.  it is a bit expensive considering i go through a lot of shampoo, but i thought i would give it a whirl.  i&#x27;m glad i did.  for the first few weeks, i really felt my oily scalp was totally under control.  granted, i still have to shampoo twice (just as their directions say), but i feel like the shampoo is gentle.  i also love the ingredient list, no sulfates/sulfites/etc.  i&#x27;m not sure what ingredients are magically in the shampoo, but i am glad it&#x27;s around.  i also ordered the formula specifically for dandruff, but i find the degreasing one to work better for me.  i&#x27;m not sure why but the last fews i feel the shampoo isn&#x27;t as effective.  i have been following up with a 50/50 blend of vinegar and water as a scalp rinse to help control my greasy scalp and dandruff.  i&#x27;ll update my review as i continue to use the shampoo.  i wish amazon or maple holistics itself offered much bigger sized bottles as i go through a lot of shampoo quickly.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this shampoo. I have very long, colored, baby fine, thin hair. If I try to buy a clarifying or volumizing shampoo, it leaves my hair dried out out and easily tangled. If I get something moisturizing, then I am a greasy mess. I began noticing after I had children that my scalp became VERY itchy. I could not find a shampoo that met all of my weirdo needs! This shampoo does to trick. I can even go a day without washing my hair, which I could NEVER do before. I use the Maple Holistics Silk18 conditioner on the tips of my hair, then use this on my roots. Perfect balance. My husband loves it too! I took off a star because with two adults using this shampoo we go through it very quickly, and at $2 an ounce, it hurts the wallet. Buying the larger size isn&#x27;t really a discount, but it keeps us from having to replace it monthly. It&#x27;s well worth it, I am finishing my second bottle. Usually I get a third of the way through a bottle of shampoo and it&#x27;s in the trash, so I figure it saves in the long run.</li>
    <li> Love this product for my pre-teen. It is the only shampoo I&#x27;ve found that works great on her oily hair.</li>
    <li> Good product! I&#x27;ll keep using it!</li>
    <li> This shampoo has worked wonders on my daughter&#x27;s hair. Before degrease shampoo, her hair was always oily looking, even shortly after she washed it (and she washed it every single day). After using this shampoo, her hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy any more. She can even go a day without washing and it still looks fine. I am very happy with this purchase and am about to buy our third bottle.</li>
    <li> My 14 year old son uses this product. We are on our 3rd bottle. He previously used Clarifying Shampoo, which was great for his greasy hair. Then he developed dandruff, which the clarifying shampoo didn&#x27;t address. This product completely eliminated his dandruff and the grease. I gave it 4 stars because the clarifying shampoo did a little better job with the grease. Overall we are very happy with the product and would recommend it for people suffering from both oily hair and dandruff.</li>
    <li> I have very thin fine hair. If I don&#x27;t wash it everyday it&#x27;s greasy and flat. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of shampoos over the years but this one is a winner!!! It cleans my hair really well and I can tell while still in the shower that my hair is really clean. I used the Silk18 conditioner and I just love the outcome. My hair is so clean and shinning! It even have some volume too. I really didn&#x27;t believe that anything would help my hair after so many years of looking for something out there that actually enhance my hair but I really feel this shampoo does the trick.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo ever.</li>
    <li> The Degrease shampoo for the most part, does what it advertises. If you have oily hair or combination oily/dry hair, it will help with the itchiness and refresh your scalp. Since I wash my hair every other day, right after washing my hair is smooth, silky and free of oil and grease; by the next day however, I can start to see that my hair near the scalp is more weighed down and definitely needs washing by the night. I took one star off since it didn&#x27;t completely cure or rid my hair of oil grease and tiny flakes, but honestly this is probably one of the better alternatives I&#x27;ve found in the tens of products I&#x27;ve tried. Also be sure to condition your hair after using Degrease, which will help de-tangle and smooth your locks.&lt;br /&gt;Overall though, Degrease is a great shampoo and I will be re-purchasing. Next up I am trying the tea tree shampoo from Maple Holistics, so we&#x27;ll see if they one works better for my hair. I believe different people will experience different results, and this one is worth a shot!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I have colored weak hair and is fallen a lot. I have been using this shampoo every day for one week since I received it and it makes my hair shiny and less fallen. I like this organic made shampoo and I recommend every one to use it.</li>
    <li> For years I have struggled finding a shampoo for oily hair, went to a dermatologist and he recommended a $60.00 shampoo that was utterly worthless, bought this and on the third day my scalp feels dry, clean, not itchy and my hair does not feel frizzy, dry or damaged.</li>
    <li> felt great after the wash, but hair becomes unmanageable and becomes oily the same day. Didn&#x27;t work for me and would not recommend it for the price either. Now I understand why it sells only on Amazon with high reviews.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a while now and it does not do anything for me but my husband really liked it. He says that his head remains cleaner for longer. I guess that is a very good sign. I would say, try it -- but it won&#x27;t work on everyone.</li>
    <li> All of the sudden, my hair started to be really sticky and oily. At first I thought I wasn&#x27;t rinsing well enough, but that wasn&#x27;t it. I tried vinegar, white and apple cider, slightly diluted in warm water...no help. This was probably the 6th shampoo I tried to address the issue, after aveda, Paul Mitchell, and a few others. It didn&#x27;t work overnight, but after about 1/3 of the bottle and an increase in scrubbing my scalp with my fingers, my greasiness has lessened tremendously.</li>
    <li> Bought like 3 of these.&lt;br /&gt;Scalp smell is getting better and is less itchy.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I have tried many different shampoos, but I was not getting the result I was looking for. I have an itchy scalp and oily hairs. This shampoo cleans my hair very well, no itches, and do not get hairs oily for a full day. A small amount of shampoo cleans hairs very well and it almost lasts for more than three months! Overall, it is a great product and I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo improved my scalp&#x27;s flakiness significantly, and it performs perfectly as far as cleaning away oil/grease/etc. goes. I would say I saw a mild reduction in overall oil production as well. One thing to note is that the formula apparently changed from a less viscous greenish fluid to a more viscous white fluid - I have used the new formulation and I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s better or worse (so, for right now, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s still very good). I first started using the greenish version last year, which was wonderful in improving the health of my scalp, and now I continue to use this shampoo. I&#x27;ve thought about going back to cheaper shampoos, but I figure, why not continue with this one and not worry about if moving to a different shampoo would worsen my scalp! I haven&#x27;t used the new white formulation as long as the old green one, so I&#x27;ll report back if my hair/scalp start reacting poorly but so far so good.</li>
    <li> This shampoo leaves my hair and my head completely clean without feeling stripped clean or dry and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously I would need to wash, scrub, rinse and repeat a few times to get my head/hair feeling truly clean, but at that point my hair felt almost wiry and my scalp started to itch almost immediately. This was too much washing, it stripped off all oil and moisture. Hated it but had to get clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I shampoo normally, am out of the shower in a reasonable amount of time, my head and hair are clean, my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch and my hair styles easily AND it *seems* like it is cleaner at the end of the day, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for four weeks and the only change I&#x27;ve made since starting is that I use a little less (it lathers nicely) and don&#x27;t need to scrub as much because my head/hair are both generally cleaner upon getting in the shower. Also my scalp is much healthier overall, not totally perfect (yet) but feels great and is definitely in a lot better condition than four weeks ago.</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo for price</li>
    <li> Both my husband and daughter had very oily hair.  I had purchased the shampoo for them.  They would wash their hair at night and by mid day the next day, it was very oily again.  Now with this shampoo, they can go two days without washing their.  The shampoo also makes their hair look shiny and fuller.</li>
    <li> I think this does a great job of extending how often you can go without your hair becoming overly oily, but I also think it&#x27;s very important to follow the directions and leave it on your hair for the recommended amount of time!  I love this shampoo and will likely purchase it in the future.  I received this as a free sample to try, but it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that I think it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> The smell is a little strange, but not bad.  I only put this on my scalp and really condition my ends, if I don&#x27;t this would dry my ends out.  It really does a great job controlling scalp oil production.  I don&#x27;t use it enough to see any lasting results, but when I do use it I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair immediately the next day.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered this shampoo and so far I like it. My hair is very very oily, so after trying so many different ones, I think Ive found one I really like. I can go without washing my hair for at least 2-3 days now. Before I had to fast almost the very next day. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering this shampoo again.</li>
    <li> Loving the shampoo with cleansing properties with natural ingredients. It surely works compare to what I have used in past. I also got Silk 18 Conditioner which is even better at its job. Giving Four stars because of Price. :(  Organic and Natural Products should be offered at competitive price to promote the products compare to chemicals loaded products.</li>
    <li> i know this removes oil from my hair pretty well, but the smell makes it seem more effective for me.</li>
    <li> Normally I do not write review but this time is different... The product is really good and the customer service is incredible!</li>
    <li> The product has a strange smell but overall it works. Results start showing around two uses. My hair has a lot less oil and grease to it, and because it is dyed the color was not being stripped as much as Head and Shoulders would. The product does leave your hair a bit dry.   Also, the shampoo is not a conditioner, so you may have to use conditioner if you want it to be smoother and silkier afterwards.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to find a shampoo to help combat scalp oiliness. I found this shampoo and decided to give it a try because it doesn&#x27;t contain harsh ingredients like some others I&#x27;ve tried. I found this product to be a quality shampoo and it has helped with my oily hair and I can now go 2-3 days in between washing my hair. It has a nice pleasant natural smell that is not overpowering. It leaves scalp and hair feeling clean without a build up. The only thing I would recommend is purchasing the Silk conditioner in conjunction with the shampoo if you have long hair that tangles easily. I found that I needed a conditioner for the ends of my hair like with any other shampoo I&#x27;ve used. This shampoo is gentle yet effective.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle product by any means.If anything,it dried my hair out not my scalp.</li>
    <li> I am really loving my first Maple Holistic product, the Shampoo For Oily, Itchy and Greasy Hair. I tend to have oily hair  (especially around my hairline) even when I wash my hair every day or two. But a few months ago I resolved to washing less, most especially to avoid using as much heat to style so often. So now I go several days between washes, usually washing on the third or fourth day... and my hair can get pretty oily! I like that the natural oils are nourishing my hair but I like for my hair to feel clean after I wash it and other shampoos were not doing the trick. I would have to wash really well two times to achieve my desired level of cleanliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Maple Holistics shampoo I only have to wash once, saving me time and money AND it is less impactful on the environment. I rinse my hair with very warm water to loosen the oils up and then I split my hair just above my ears and put a little more than a quarter size amount of the product on the bottom half of my scalp, concentrating on massaging it into my scalp and the roots of my hair and letting it set (not pulling it through to the ends) while I do the same at the crown of my head. I usually let it sit for a minute or so while I wash and then I add a bit of water and a little conditioner and massage it into the rest of my hair. After rinsing I condition, concentrating mostly on the ends and trying not to massage into my scalp too much. Then I rinse with cooler water after a minute or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now back to the bit where I said I add a little conditioner when I lather the Shampoo for Oily, Itchy and Greasy hair... I found in the first times I used it that, although working nicely to break down the oils, that it was maybe a little too effective, leaving my hair feeling very dry. So I tried letting it set on my scalp for less time but it didn&#x27;t change the result (and I have found that that step is really beneficial in helping to calm the sebaceous glands, so much so that, at about the half-used mark of my first bottle, I have already noticed that my hair is less oily for the first couple of days after washing). So I decided to see what it would be like to add the conditioner and, wa-la! It felt much better! Before, I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable running my fingers through after washing, before conditioning, because my hair felt too dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the result of having overly-cleaned hair was something I actually expected, given the nature of the product, and it most certainly isn&#x27;t a deterrent to me continuing to use it. My one suggestion would be to search for a way to make it a little gentler on hair, perhaps coconut or Moroccan oil, if that doesn&#x27;t tamper with the effectiveness of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this shampoo and can&#x27;t wait to try other products too! I have already told a couple people about it at Thanksgiving dinner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I almost forgot the mention that it smells great and gives a nice little tingling feeling. Cheers!</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a shampoo for oily hair for my teenage daughter.  I tried salons, beauty stores,  and regular retail stores...nothing. while looking through Amazon for Christmas gifts, I came across this shampoo and decided to take a chance. My daughter is very happy with the results. She no longer has an oily scalp and greasy looking hair. This is a wonderful product that does exactly as claimed. So now I am going to stock up on a couple more bottles for her!!!</li>
    <li> I have only used this shampoo a few times, but I already know I love it. I have long, straight, fine and oily hair. I cannot go a day without washing my hair. I think I could with this shampoo if I wanted to. My hair does not feel stripped after using it, but it does feel clean. The smell of this shampoo might not be for everyone. It smells like frankincense to me and I happen to like frankincense. The fragrance does not last long after rinsing it out so even if you don&#x27;t like it, it shouldn&#x27;t prevent you from trying it.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with oily hair my whole life. After reading the positive reviews on this, I thought I had found the solution. Not only did it make no difference in the sebum levels of my hair, but it made me break out on the nape of my neck and hairline. Would not recommend and am sorry I spent 17 dollars on it.</li>
    <li> So glad I found this product. Degrease shampoo is awesome! It left my hair squeaky clean without drying it out. I have use so many different shampoos in the past for my oily scalp. It always over dryed my hair leaving it itchy, full of static, dull, and within days spilt ends. Most other products you can only use once a week. I use this everyday. My hair is shiny and full of life. My scalp is not itchy or oily. My scalp is not dry and flakey either. The company has great customer relations too.They are happy to answer any question and deliver a great product.</li>
    <li> Excellent Shampoo.  All natural, and not only does it clean the hair naturally and VERY effectively, there are other benefits with the ingredients that are absorbed into the scalp/skin.  Also for your face, as you are not having chemicals go into or from your scalp to your face causing acne, etc.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is invigorating and once you try this you will never want to go back to regular shampoo.  I&#x27;m going to try another type also, but I wanted to try this one first since I do experience oily hair.  :)</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this shampoo, but it made my hair feel coated and goopy. I tried it 2 different times for several days-day one, it seemed to cleanse well. Then, every day after that, my hair felt heavier and greasier and this was while I was washing it. It also makes my conditioner foam up, as if the conditioner is cleansing the shampoo out. It smells good, but does not help with oily hair at all.</li>
    <li> Tried this shampoo for my oily scalp, it does not work or me, my scalp become oily after few hours of usage.</li>
    <li> I thought this product was great.  I really enjoyed the lack of chemical agents within the product and I thought it made my hair fresh and clean without all the heavy scents and other additive products.  I would recommend this product to anyone interested in herbal solutions that help create nice clean hair.</li>
    <li> great product, smell wonderful, lather great and works like a charm for itchy scalp [for any reason] use as directed and your hair will be perfect every time. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I have tried many different methods for stopping my greasy hair. However, this shampoo has definitely worked the best. It keeps my hair from getting greasy during the day. It also makes my hair shiny and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does what it claims. My hair was definitely less greasy one day post-wash. But that being said, I still don&#x27;t think I could go two days before washing again. The smell is nice (although it&#x27;s not really something you would expect from a shampoo). My hair felt pretty soft, too. I also appreciate the nature of the company. I received an email politely requesting that I review their product - honestly. They stressed the fact that they wanted an HONEST review. I hate when I&#x27;m reading reviews and I feel like I&#x27;m reading something off an infomercial. So keep reading the reviews, maybe others have had better success than I have. Products tend to work different from person to person.</li>
    <li> This was an average product to stop oil, you had to use it every day or every other day. For severe itchiness&lt;br /&gt;it would not help. It helped a little sometimes. Way over priced, it smelled like old licorice one moment, the&lt;br /&gt;next it smelled like a bunch of weeds, maybe too much organic.</li>
    <li> I love the nice scent and my hair feels so clean all during the day plus I noticed I have not been scratching my head the past couple of days so that&#x27;s a big plus!! I would recommend this particular shampoo to anyone.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is probably one of the best shampoos that I&#x27;ve used, it leaves my hair feeling completely clean and fresh. It also lathers very well with only a small amount and also does wonders for dandruff. I only use it 2-3 times per week because my hair tends to a get a bit dry after everyday use but that could be just my hair. Looking forward to trying other products from this company, keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks, and I have found it very effective.  It&#x27;s worth the cost.  I like the smell, and it feels great on my head when I use it in the shower.  I have a very greasy scalp, and I have always felt that I had to wash my hair every day.  Recently I went to work without taking a shower in the morning, and my hair didn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; and stringy.  That&#x27;s a real win in my book.  It&#x27;s even helped clear up the breakouts that I have along my hairline on my neck and forehead.  I will be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> I have been using cheaper shampoo, assuming that it would help me with my oily hair. I have dry scalp, thin hair, and dyed. I was searching for a product that is known to be effective, affordable, and works well. I stumbled upon this product because it is one of the top five in its category. When I received the product, I ended up using it the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first the smell was strange and it left my hair dry, but it is a shampoo after all so conditioner would be required. The itch and oil in my hair was absent for almost a week. As long as I do not touch it as often, the oil may not even come back after the week is over. It really depends on how you take care of your hair, so after using this product try to take precautions in how you treat your hair. Eventually, after a few uses you should see results like I did. Took me at least two usages to see results. I would recommend this product overall.</li>
    <li> This is a must for someone who has a dry scalp and oily hair. If you wash your hair with any other shampoo and it is oily by the evening you need to try this. I tried the Sage shampoo and it did not work for me. This one works and very well. I pair it with the Vanilla conditioner by the same brand. Love it too. Try it. I will not buy any other shampoo.</li>
    <li> after the first time using, i found it&#x27;s useless, my hair became greasy again in less than 24h as usual, and it smells bad. feeling a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Pretty good shampoo. While rinsing I could definitely feel how light and airy my hair felt. Other shampoos leave my hair feeling heavy and weighed down. Smell wasn&#x27;t strong which I like. Only problem I had is even after conditioning  it made my hair a little harder to manage once dry but nothing a little extra conditioner can&#x27;t fix. Would definitely recommend and will buy again!</li>
    <li> great for people with oily hair, follow uo with recommended conditioner</li>
    <li> After I had my son, my whole head changed and my hair was always SO OILY. I did notice improvement after a few washes! make sure you get a good lather and give it time to work. Unfortunately my scalp went back to being greasy again once I discontinued use. I guess whatever problem I have is ongoing so I&#x27;ll have to continue use to reap the benefits.</li>
    <li> The absolute best shampoo you will ever buy in your life. They even have a 100% money back guarantee.</li>
    <li> Great product! I was skeptical at first. I have used this shampoo a few times now and can FINALLY go longer than a day without washing my hair. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel oily the next day, especially my bangs, which used to always look like an oily mess. Big thanks!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately it made my hair oily quicker than usual so I&#x27;m back to using oil control head and shoulders</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the hardest time searching for daily shampoo for oily hair.  I don&#x27;t know if I was searching in all the wrong places and they have been here the whole entire time or if companies are starting to offer more off these products. I&#x27;ve used the Neutrogena shampoo but that&#x27;s only to be used occasionally as it can dry your hair out too much, it&#x27;s too rough. It helped a little but it was not enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some time I decided to look for daily shampoo again to combat my oily hair and wouldn&#x27;t u know it there was a ton of different options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this product because of the reviews and the price. I&#x27;m glad I did. The oil is my hair stays manageable for much longer and I don&#x27;t get headaches from all the oil. My hair is smooth, not dry- just right. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me but I can see that it will for some people. I would def. give this product a try. You might fall in love with it or u may not. Either way you won&#x27;t be spending too much money (unlike other like shampoos) if it doesn&#x27;t work out.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have oily/greasy hair but my head has been itching lately. I kept complaining to my friend that I feel like I have lice but I keep checking and my head is clean so I blamed it on sweat. My friend told me to try this shampoo out because it totally cured her dandruff problem.&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant because I don&#x27;t have an actual dandruff problem and I just assumed the itchiness was from the heat but I decided to try it out anyway. After 2 days of using this shampoo, my head stopped itching! I totally thought it was a fluke so I went back to Pantene and my head started itching again. I am definitely going to be sticking to this from now on :)</li>
    <li> Degrease moisture control shampoo is definitely a five star quality product.  The label design is very appealing, the smell is unique and wonderful, and most importantly, it \\&quot;degreased\\&quot; my scalp.  I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo now for a few weeks, following the directions on the bottle carefully.  After a week and a half of near daily use, things started to take effect.  Using Degrease is like taking a sponge, absorbing all the excess oil, and leaving my head with a perfect, natural feel.  I&#x27;m not even near halfway done with the bottle, and it has been about a month.  Well worth the money, there&#x27;s no point in nickel-and-diming all of the ineffective shampoos.  If you want to stick to the winners, stick with this company.</li>
    <li> This shampoo used to be of low viscosity, green in color and relatively high in aromatic oil content compared to the current thick white formulation knock-off which looks and feels like standard low cost supermarket shampoo, but it&#x27;s also NOT EFFECTIVE! Junk. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I only have good things to say about this shampoo. It has a pleasant aroma and does what it says, especially taking away itchiness.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I have chronic greasy/oily/itchy hair. I have to wash my hair every day. This shampoo definitely helps!!. I still have to wash my hair every day but my hair is not as greasy/itchy anymore. Will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I have thick hairs and feel light in summer after using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I am a big natural fan, and have replaced many of my products with natural varieties.  Shampoo/conditioner were my last products to replace.  I tried forever to find a natural product that I liked, but most all of them made my hair stringy and weighed nown.  Wasn&#x27;t worth the natural in my opinion.  I bought some of maple holistics contioner for my daugter&#x27;s curly hair and liked it myself, so thought I would try this shampoo as well.  I can honestly say that I love it.  It is the first to leave my curls curly without weighing down my hair and making it look stringy.  I&#x27;m totally hooked.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this! I saw one post about using it for acne and so I tried it--it&#x27;s true, it works great. Gets rid of greasy scalp and cleans greasy skin. My son likes it for both things as well.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works wonders for me.  I have excess sebum secretion due to lack of thryoid and whacked out thyroid levels.  My itchy scalp is gone after one use and if I use daily I hardly get the oily flakes</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have oily hair at the roots and dry hair at the ends, and I used to wash my scalp with shampoo for volume which wasn&#x27;t what I needed be it dried more my ends. Maple holistic shampoo for oily hair is awesome bc some of its incredients don&#x27;t dry my ends but dry my oily scalp what is extacly what I wanted. And on top of that has only holistic incredients.</li>
    <li> The first Order never arrived. Had to be sent again. Received a $14.00 Adjustment. Good Product.&lt;br /&gt;Aloha,&lt;br /&gt;Juergen W. Will</li>
    <li> I have tried various shampoos to combat my oily hair and irritated scalp.  I can&#x27;t name them off the top of my head, but they were mostly the ones you&#x27;d find at local drugstores.  I do recall having tried tea tree oil shampoo as well, but no luck.  I saw this online and was really excited to try something new.  The biggest turn off for me, however, was the price.  I feel the asking price is rather steep just for shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I have to say that this stuff works well for me.  My hair is short, average thickness and tends to be wavy as it grows longer.  I tend to have an itchy scalp towards the upper back of my head, but no dandruff.  I would experience around 1-3 small bumps at a given time that appeared to feel like pimples...but I was never sure what they were.  Either way, the itchiness would drive me insane at times.  When I gave in and would scratch my head, the number one thing I would notice was how greasy my hair felt.  This led me to believe that my oily hair was to blame for the bumps and itchiness I was experiencing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this shampoo, I felt relief from the itchiness and the overly greasy hair.  My hair used to get so greasy that I could style it without any products (of course, this was later in the day, not right out of the shower!).  Now, I don&#x27;t experience that anymore.  It&#x27;s a huge relief and I&#x27;m glad I was able to find something that works.  No more itching, the bumps are completely gone and goodbye grease.  Since I&#x27;m a guy with short hair, I don&#x27;t know how this would affect someone&#x27;s hair that is longer and of a different texture.  But I think if you are willing to put out a little more money to relieve your itching scalp and greasy hair, this is worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took one star away for the price.  Sorry!  Works great for me, I just feel it&#x27;s rather expensive just for shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have suffered for a while with oily hair and an itchy scalp. I don&#x27;t have dandruff so it was hard to find a product that targeted these specific concerns. I wanted a product that was natural so it would be lacking the harsh chemicals found in most other shampoos. I&#x27;m glad I found this product! It helps relieve the itchy scalp and leaves my oily hair clean and with a fresh clean scent. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I am surprised by all the good reviews because this product is not good at all it doesn&#x27;t smell all that great and it leaves my fine hair so dry and tangled that I cant even get a comb through it.</li>
    <li> I have an adolescent daughter who&#x27;s hair has recently become quite greasy. She&#x27;s tried at least a dozen shampoos and finally asked me to see if I could locate a good one.  I bought two different brands from Amazon a couple of months ago.  This one was a hit; I&#x27;ve now bought several more bottles, which we&#x27;ll use going forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo does what it says it will do; it pleases adolescent daughters. I withhold the fifth star simply because the shampoo is pricey.  That point aside, it is a superior product.</li>
    <li> I recently tried &amp;#34;Degrease&amp;#34; shampoo from Maple Holistics and was pleasantly surprised. I live in the HOT Arizona area with daily temperatures in the 100&#x27;s...needless to say perspiration is a problem here. My hair is naturally oily as it is and excess perspiration doesn&#x27;t help!  &amp;#34;Degrease&amp;#34; shampoo truly cleaned my hair/scalp and seems to decrease in excess sweating of the scalp onto hair...stays cleaner...longer!  Good stuff. Does however not &amp;#34;condition&amp;#34; hair....simply cleans it very well. Note: the version I tried must have been an older one as it did not contain Keratin, Jojoba, etc that the current version does.&lt;br /&gt;W Marcoux / Chandler,AZ</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with a greasy scalp &amp; combination skin for as long as I can remember. I recently learned the cheap crap shampoo I&#x27;ve been buying is actually stripping my hair of natural oils and therefore causing my scalp to hyper-produce oil to try to makeup for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think you&#x27;ve got oil issues? I can not go a day without washing my hair. If I don&#x27;t, I look like a sleazy car salesman with all that oil. And my skin feels even worse. My skin is so oily that even if I take a Mexican shower in the sink for my bangs so my hair looks acceptable, my skin is still so oily (even after I wash it) that I can hardly stand it. It feels disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after some extensive researching, this was one of the few products I could find that didn&#x27;t have s*** ingredients, but was still somewhat affordable. Since Maple Holistics doesn&#x27;t have a conditioner I also decided to buy the Wen Cucumber Aloe Cleansing Conditioner since so many people seemed obsessed with it &amp; that one is for oil control. Here is what happened:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got Degrease first &amp; while my stylist said that it could take up to 1 month to fix my issues, the difference after 2 DAYS was insane. For the first time in my life I could go 2 days without washing my hair. My scalp didn&#x27;t get as oily as usual &amp; neither did my skin. That day was amazing. And my hair just felt SO much better. It was less tangled, more voluminous, all around awesome. And it just feels so clean. Do you know how relieving it is to not worry about all the oil for the first time in my life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s way better than Wen. I actually dislike the Wen product, my scalp/skin reacts no differently, it gets just as oily, if not worse. And for $30 that was a huge waste. Plus it has Cetyl Alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONLY Con: It&#x27;s a small bottle. I wish it came in a much larger bottle with a bulk price tag. I did just notice on their website that if you buy at least 2 bottles, you get them for $12/bottle. Which is certainly much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(PS if anyone else struggles with oily/combination skin, I just discovered Vasanti BrightenUp! It&#x27;s unlike any product I&#x27;ve tried for help with my oily skin. It is A+ amazing.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had oily hair. This made my hair even more oily and feel like straw. After giving it a chance for few days I had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of this shampoo, however it did not work for me. I have an EXTREMELY oily scalp (&amp;face) &amp; while this didn&#x27;t do the job for my hair it makes my daughters hair just as gorgeous &amp; soft as if she just left the salon! Her hair type is normal though.</li>
    <li> Maple Holistics changed the formula and I am finding it to be less effective in treating my terribly oily hair!  It used to be green with a nice consistency.  Now it is a pearly white and thicker and more soapy.  I was very happy with Degreaser shampoo prior to the change, now I am so disappointed!  Why would they change something that worked???  This new formula seems a lot like many other shampoo&#x27;s I have tried from CVS, Target, etc...</li>
    <li> It feels great and cut the grease sensation; but at the end of the day, i still have grease scalp, maybe i need a little more agressive treatmen for my problem.</li>
    <li> Bought  the product last week and it seems that my scalp is getting less oily. I am planning to buy some more to use it for a longer period.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works great. Makes my hair thicker and it&#x27;s much easier to style.</li>
    <li> Great natural product. Love it. Will order again. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  The smell (can&#x27;t even call it the scent)  caused me a severe allergy.  And shampoo made my hair look and feel like a heavy pancake on my head.  Had to use my old shampoo to wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;I still think that other people with a different type of hair can use it successfully and be very happy.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! Natural ingredients, smells great and does a wonderfull job. My hair  is definitely less oily and it doesnt dry me out either. If you have a greasy scalp I&#x27;d  definitely  recommend  you try this.</li>
    <li> I recently had the chance to try the degrease shampoo from maple holistics. Though many products claim to be all natural and organuc, many of them tend to have a few chemicals in them. As far as this one is concerrned,for my sticky and greasy hair ,many of the shampoos i tried either made my hair too dry stripping off the natural oils or my hair had a constant build up after using them. But this one rightly cleansed my hair and made my hair non greasy and soft.  I have since been impressed by their quality and have tried out a few other products from maple holistics as well.  It is pricey when compared to others but sometimes u got to pay for the quality and standard.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shampoo for my daughter since she has oily hair. And so far it is doing exactly what it said it would do. Her hair feels and looks less oily only after using it twice. And it smells good too, unlike some shampoos for oily hair that have the medicine smell. very pleased!</li>
    <li> I have really Oily hair and it left my hair feeling clean and refreshed no build up or nothing...</li>
    <li> My husband and I both have oily and itchy scalp and we got this to try since nothing on the market seemed to work for us. We noticed a difference after the first use. Our scalp was not itchy or oily and continued to stay that way with each use. Before if we skipped a day between washing our hair and scalp would be in terrible shape but now using this shampoo we don&#x27;t even notice that we skipped a washing.</li>
    <li> I love the way my hair feels and looks after using this product.  I have oily hair and had moved to a house with very hard water which resulted in very greasy hard to clean hair.  After just a few uses, my hair felt clean and healthy.  The ends of my hair did get slightly dry since I was not using any conditoner with it, so I started using a light leave in conditioner on just the ends and my hair has never looked or felt better.  I saw a lot of reviews saying the smell was not good, I like it because it is not a strong scent and seems very refreshing.</li>
    <li> This product is everything it claims to be and more. I no longer constantly itch my scalp. My hair feels clean and not weighed down. My hair and scalp feel a whole lot healthier now and I noticed a difference within the first 3 washes. I would recommend this product for anyone who has very oily/greasy hair. This shampoo also smells fantastic and I feel better about using it as opposed to other big name store brands.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!  It is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used for Oily hair.  It cuts down on the times I have to wash my hair.  Fabulous!</li>
    <li> Bought this because it was organic and my girlfriend is all about that stuff so she told me to try something different than what i was originally using. I get oily hair like crazy. Just after one day after I take a shower, my hair gets oily and greasy and it bothers me so much. The oily scalp even contributes to me getting dandruff as well. After several times using this shampoo I have to say that I am in love with this shampoo! It keeps my hair oil free for several days and also i no longer have dandruff and that to me is a shampoo that works.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is really amazing. It is very useful to keep your hair fresh and get rid of the oil.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is fantastic!  I have incredibly fine, thin, straight hair and if I don&#x27;t wash my hair daily, it&#x27;s essentially an oil slick by the second day (requiring a considerable amount of dry shampoo if I plan to leave the house at all).  However, this is the first hair product that I&#x27;ve found which actually controls your scalp oil production - I&#x27;m on day two, and it&#x27;s looking good!  My daughter has the opposite hair texture of me - wavy, thick and a bit coarser...but she still has the problem with hair looking oily on day two - this worked equally as good for her! Yes, it is more expensive than your drugstore brand shampoos, but I have tried almost everything and nothing has worked for me (even attempting the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; trend).  It is also sulfate free, and smells fantastic. I highly recommend this product, and am so glad I stumbled upon it on Amazon when searching for &amp;#34;shampoo for oily hair&amp;#34;.  Thank you, Maple Holistics!</li>
    <li> After many years of searching, I finally found shampoo that works for my hair and greasy scalp. Unlike commercial products I&#x27;ve tried, this shampoo doesn&#x27;t have a strong artificial scent but rather a natural/organic one. It feels thicker and more viscous, however, which takes getting used to. This is the only shampoo I now use daily. The bottomline is that it degreases the scalp without over drying it and somehow keeps it from becoming oily. It strikes the perfect balance. The only downside is the price. I go through one bottle per month so it is definitely going to cost a lot more than the products I can buy from local grocery stores.</li>
    <li> This product works as is described. It gets rid of the oil and grease in my hair and leaves hair feeling fresh and revitalized and it contains natural ingredients that doesn&#x27;t harm your hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a month and it hasn&#x27;t helped. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair but my scalp gets oily faster.</li>
    <li> I have medium length, fine hair, which gets so greasy I cannot go without washing it everyday. I have shaved my head twice and wouldn&#x27;t wash it everyday since it wasn&#x27;t obvious, but it still was incredibly greasy after it started growing out. This shampoo has been a heaven sent. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot and I do use a tiny bit of conditioner but my hair isn&#x27;t disgusting the next day. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! My son had perpetually oily hair and always looked unwashed. We&#x27;ve tried everything out there. Even spoke with a dermatologist. This product has been amazing for him. His hair looks soft and clean and shiny without looking oily or dirty. Great product!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my sister after she started complaining about having flakes and an itchy scalp out of nowhere, which she thinks is related to mild seborrheic dermatitis that often goes hand in hand with rosacea. I was honestly a bit skeptical about the claims that were being made, both by the company and all of the reviewers, especially because $17 is a lot of spend on shampoo. My sister said she&#x27;d be interested in trying it, though, so I bought it for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to now, and she said she&#x27;s really glad I bought it for her, because it always relieves the itching she experiences with her scalp, and no other shampoo has so far. The only thing that is kind of weird for her is that her hair can literally get squeaky clean with this stuff, so she said it takes some getting used to. She conditions her hair with the Silk 18 conditioner and leaves it in for a good five minutes before rinsing, and although it feels different in the shower than &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; shampoo and conditioner, she said when her hair dries it&#x27;s much shinier than it is with other shampoo and conditioners. She said it doesn&#x27;t feel (literally in her hands) like the conditioner is doing anything, because it isn&#x27;t slimy like most others, but once her hair is dry, she&#x27;s really happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should add that all people are different, all hair is different, and what works for one person might not work for another. My sister&#x27;s hair is straight and the hairs are fine, but it&#x27;s thick because she has a lot of them, and her hair is also naturally oily. Again, she&#x27;s also fairly sure that she has mild seborrheic dermatitis - so if you&#x27;re similar to her, she recommends giving this a shot, as long as you condition the middle and ends of your hair properly.</li>
    <li> Trying this product out, I can see why it&#x27;s well liked. I&#x27;ve only used this twice in a few days, but it has really helped out the oil situation I have been having with my hair. I have a tendency to have oily hair with dandruff and it can get quite itchy. Every time I use this, I scratch less than I originally have before, the skin on my hair is less irritated, and my hair stays drier (but still moisturized) longer. Plus, the smell is amazing and very therapeutic, reminding me of aromatherapy oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to continue to use this and am debating on getting more because this is doing something that my original shampoo wasn&#x27;t: fixing an issue I&#x27;ve had for years. I might even try the dandruff shampoo version Maple Holistics has.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos that promise they will clear the oily scalp but to no avail. So far, Degrease is the best of the lot. While it has not fully solved my extremely oily scalp condition, I can feel that the scalp is definitely less oily even 24 hrs after I shampoo my hair and scalp. Love the smell that makes it feel very \\&quot;homeopathic\\&quot; too.</li>
    <li> While this product does indeed remove build-up and leaves your hair feeling squeaky clean, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d say that my hair is any less greasy than it normally is. My hair still gets oily again within 24 hours, and I&#x27;ve been using this product for three months. I like how the shampoo is natural and lathers up nicely though, so I&#x27;ll probably keep on using it!</li>
    <li> I have a very oily, dandruff filled, itchy scalp. I bought this product after I read the reviews. The only reason there are so many is because of the incentive you get for reviewing. I have been using this product for two months, and almost cry at buying a bottle for 15 dollars and having to shampoo my hair twice and not noticing some miraculous change. I guess my hair is a bigger monster.</li>
    <li> It works, yes, but it makes my hair feel like straw and the smell isn&#x27;t exactly pleasant. I still use conditioner.</li>
    <li> Love this product so far. It has allowed me to only wash my hair twice weekly. Using my old shampoo I had to either wash daily or use dry shampoo the next day. My hair is almost to my belly button so the less washing the better. Love the way this makes my hair look and feel. So light and fluffy for days!</li>
    <li> Absolutely Stunning!!!!!</li>
    <li> For years I have had problems with itchy scalp and have tried all kinds of shampoos, including no shampooing.  This is the first product that seems to be making a difference without any harsh chemicals or smells.</li>
    <li> it is a good shampoo.my hair does not get greasy even  after 24 hours.it used to get greasy after 12 hours . definitely buying it again.</li>
    <li> As advertised, this shampoo degreases my hair really well. I use it whenever I wash my hair and my hair feels so much cleaner for so much longer. It makes a huge difference in how oily and itchy my hair feels. Most noticeably, it&#x27;s gotten rid of the small white flakes that appear in my hair a day or two after being washed (the reason I got this product in the first place). I love it. I really, really recommend it to anyone with the same kinds of issues.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good shampoo. lathers nicely. I don&#x27;t have what I would refer to as greasy hair but I have oily skin so I was looking for something that would maybe help me not have to wash my hair as much. This cleans well. I will by again, just because I think its nice to have a natural shampoo to take a break from chemicals and its safe for color treated hair. I don&#x27;t use it every wash. I rotate it out with another shampoo. So, even if you are thinking about buying it but you only have mildly oily scalp I think this is good.</li>
    <li> very nice lather, cleansing and smells great, however it did nothing for the oil and dead skin on my scalp.</li>
    <li> Before I found this shampoo, I was in a viscous cycle, my hair was greasy everyday so I would wash it everyday to make it presentable which stripped the oils and caused rebound greasiness! Rise...repeat!&lt;br /&gt;However, this shampoo really helped the problem. I can now go two days before I feel like I have to wash which is a big improvement over my hair feeling gross by the end of the work day.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little pricey compared to drugstore shampoo, but it&#x27;s worth it for how it makes my hair look and more importantly for me, feel.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. I was hoping that by using this product, I would no longer have to wash my hair every single day. I didn&#x27;t realize what a difference the shampoo was making until later when I used another shampoo for a few days and my hair felt heavy and dirty. While I wasn&#x27;t able to skip a few days by using this shampoo, it did keep my hair looking less greasy at the end of the day (the problem may not be my hair but my oily forehead). It has a pleasant smell and seemed to keep my hair nice and healthy.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this shampoo, but it made my hair feel so gross and look dirty all the time. The day I stopped using I got compliments on how much better my hair looked. I have a free bottle and a half for whoever wants it</li>
    <li> This shampoo has worked wonders for my tween daughter who has thick yet &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; hair. She uses Degrease followed by Silk 18 conditioner. He hair is soft and silky and doesn&#x27;t look oily or greasy at the end of the day, in fact she can go a day between hair washing now and it looks good. I will definitely be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> Ever since switching to an all natural chemical free lifestyle, I had to change my hair products as well. A quick Amazon search led me to Maple Holistic products. For someone who has oily hair, I can say this worked like a DREAM. My hair felt squeaky clean but not stripped. I&#x27;ve also noticed that my hair did not fall out as much as it did with other harsher shampoos. If you are thinking of switching to natural hair products then I highly recommend Maple Holistics, they have a shampoo/conditioner for every hair type!</li>
    <li> This product works great! My hair used to be so greasy and I would have to wash it daily, but with this product, my hair feels smooth and soft and moisturized, but NOT greasy! It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> Degrease has worked wonders for my preteen daughters oily scalp.  We tried a number of products before we discovered Maple Holistics.  I use it myself and tend to have an oily scalp as well, I can go two days if not more without washing my hair. The shampoo smells great and a little go a long way leaving your scalp feeling very refreshed.</li>
    <li> The change in season and allergies make my entire body itchy but my scalp and hair seem to suffer more this year.  I used the Degrease shampoo several times by now and it seems to placate my itchy scalp.  Overall my hair also seems less greasy but this could be because I just eliminated my previous shampoos and conditioners with silicones.  So far, so good.  I tried the shampoo from a friend but glad I decided to come to Amazon after browsing unsuccessfully through the somewhat limited selection of natural products in retail NYC stores (excluding obvious big producers).</li>
    <li> So far, I think that this works pretty well. It just arrived today and it is my first time using it. It doesn&#x27;t leave my feeling dried up like some shampoos do and it has an awesome tingly feeling when I use it. It also cleaned my scalp well and I don&#x27;t have that itchy feeling. However, my hair gets oily really easily (usually within one day) so I can only give it five stars after I see if my hair stays oil-free tomorrow. Also,I think it is on the more pricey side but if it works then it&#x27;d be totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo so far!! My hair has literally never been so soft. You don&#x27;t need much to get a good lather. I am extremely pleased. Also the smell is lovely</li>
    <li> I have never written a review before but if it helps anyone else with the same horrible hair problems I had then I&#x27;ll be happy. I had the worst oily hair i have ever seen for about two months. I would wash my hair, it would dry, and still look absolutely soaking wet because of the oil. I tried EVERYTHING, about 5 different shampoos (natural and more commercial), every natural remedy I could find, and multiple dry shampoos. Nothing worked. I pretty much gave up and the last thing I was going to do was try Amazon, so ordered this shampoo and hoped for the best, but was completely over trying to fix the problem. If it didn&#x27;t work I was going to call the dermatologist asap. BUT with one use, the suggested quarter size amount (which I was convinced wouldn&#x27;t be enough) my hair dried and was oil free. I mean completely oil free. My head feels a pound lighter. I can finally wear my hair down and feel pretty again! Yay! So to wrap up my rant, great shampoo it worked for me perfectly. It was absolutely worth the money and a little goes a long way. Also got here fast with the standard shipping, pleasant smell, and I like that it&#x27;s more natural than a lot of other degreasing shampoos. Thanks guys!</li>
    <li> I just bought this along with the silk conditioner... Also amazing.  For the first time since puberty I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair every day!! This company has made some really amazing products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest I didn&#x27;t know that this type of degreasing shampoo existed so I&#x27;ve never tried any kind before and stumbled upon it while looking for sulfate free shampoo and I thought I would try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ass one one would expect, though only after about a week of use, it also helps to reduce the shine on my forehead after a full day at the office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent fix for greasy oily hair... Perfect. If you are looking for a good shampoo this is the best on the market so far!!!!!</li>
    <li> I received this shampoo about a week and a half ago. I have been experiencing dandruff and some hair loss for a few years now. I found this shampoo to be very soothing to my scalp. The dandruff has not cleared up yet but the hair shedding has improved a bit. I use it every other day now. I gave it 4 stars because it is pricey and because I still have dandruff and it leaves my hair dry. But I will continue to use it because my scalp feels good and I feel assured using a natural product.</li>
    <li> Very good for oily hair. Lathers well. It is certainly better than the store bought alternatives and I ahve tried many, many brands. There is only one or two others I have found that were worthy of 4 and half stars. Still seeking the five star ones. This one was very good, but if you have fine oily scalp this one does pretty good, but is not the best. Right now it ranks 3 on my list.</li>
    <li> I tried degreased and have never found a product that cleared up my hair like this product. The first time i used it, my hair felt less greasy than it had felt in years. I love the smell and my scalp feels new again. You have to try this product if you have ever had greasy hair!</li>
    <li> The product works great if you have issues with oily hair.  I normally have to shower twice a day to keep my hair from looking oily.  With this shampoo I have clean soft hair all day.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with greasy hair, forced to wash my hair every single day because it would get greasy within 12-24 hours! I have used this twice and have washed my hair every OTHER day, this is great for me! i think i found my new shampoo :) only negative is the cost, wish it was cheaper or a larger size.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo because my hair was so oily and used to fall in big chunks due to stress that has lead to a change in my scalp hormones production. I was not so sure about it but after reading a review written by a dermatologist and after trying it myself, I just love it. I have been using it since thanksgiving day of 2013 and it is working really good for me. Now even when I don&#x27;t wash my hair for 2 or 3 days they don&#x27;t become or look as greasy as they used to be when I used to use the other shampoos one day after washing my hair. I love it and I would recommend it to anyone suffering from hair falling due to stress or hormone change during or after pregnancy. Also the shampoos arrived in adequate sized boxes.</li>
    <li> helped stop the greasiness with my daughter&#x27;s hair. Will continue to use it to see long term effect but initial results not bad.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works exactly as described. Plus it is very concentrated cause a little goes along ways! I have had great results with it &amp; it&#x27;s a lot cheaper to buy from the company directly in bulk.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product for my hair. It helped tremendously with my issues with greasy hair! I would have to say it is worth a try if you suffer with these issues also. I also find the natural products used to be beneficial for my hair without drying it out which I have found so many other shampoos to do. Great product, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love Maple Holistics!  All of their products are natural and work just as good as chemical infused products.  I have been using their Sage Shampoo for some time now, and recently switched over to the Degreaser.  I don&#x27;t have a particularly oily scalp, but between change in weather and styling I needed a good deep cleansing shampoo.  I have extensions in as well, so my head gets very, very itchy.  This shampoo is great for my scalp and works great on my extensions (real hair, tape in- if anyone has extensions).  I also got the Silk 18 conditioner to go with this.  FABULOUS!</li>
    <li> Really didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my oily hair... It&#x27;s good for a chemical free shampoo though.</li>
    <li> Do what does it says!</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time and shampoo according to the directions. so far my hair feels great and I don&#x27;t think my oily as using other products. I thought the bottle would be larger however it does take a small amount to lather up. usually my used to get oily after one day,but I shall see with this shampoo!</li>
    <li> Always has dandruff and oily hair. Tried products over the years and this is the one product that actually stands out above them all</li>
    <li> I have tried just about everything there is for oily hair. Unless I wash my hair everyday it looks extremely greasy. I can wash my hair with this and go for at least two days and my hair looks like it was just washed. Finally, a nice, clean shampoo! Perfect for a busy mom!!</li>
    <li> I have always had scalp problems because my genetics are bad. This product decimates head and shoulders and all the other garbage products which just ruin my cute pie hair. I was blown away at how fresh the product smelled and how great my hair felt afterwards. I never itch or have any problems anymore using this while H&amp;S was horrible for me. These sulfate free products are the GOAT (GOAT &#x3D; Greatest Of All Time) GG OH GG.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband. Always had dandruff and itchy scalp in the winter. After using this he did not have problems. The bottle lasted all winter and I will be buying another bottle for this winter.</li>
    <li> Best oil free shampoo I&#x27;ve tried so far (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot). Normally I&#x27;d feel like my hair needed to washed daily, but now I can comfortably wash it every other (admittedly by the end of the second day it&#x27;s definitely oily again). It&#x27;s not overly drying though. I&#x27;ve also noticed that less of my hair falls out with this product, probably because the ingredients are so natural. I&#x27;ll be sticking with this.</li>
    <li> I started to use it a few days ago an really works,my scalp smells so good and leave my hair very soft. When I buy any product,I know if it works in only a week because I feel the change.</li>
    <li> Despite the somewhat higher price, I enjoy this product because it really does help with oily, itchy, and greasy hair. The price is a little on the higher end, but it is worth the splurge. There was no buildup when using the product and it did not weigh my hair down which was a pleasant surprise. The smell is also very nice and pleasant, and since it is 100% natural- it&#x27;ll really help with my hair and its split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also maintains moisture well which will help during the winter with my dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend (:</li>
    <li> I love this Shampoo. I have used this shampoo for a few years since switching to more natural products. I had been using the same shampoo for years that worked great with my hair although it had many chemicals. I dreaded the search for a new shampoo that would make my hair greasy with build up. I was SO happy to find this product. My hair (and I) love it. No greasy build up, but still moisturizes. Perfect!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any noticeable difference after using the whole bottle. Still extremely greasy and itchy after only 1 1/2 days.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. Smells great, isn&#x27;t filled with chemicals, doesn&#x27;t fade my highlights, and helps my hair stay less oily. Only 1 star off for price. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it helped the greasiness of my hair. However, I wasn&#x27;t entirely please with the scent. Other than that, great product</li>
    <li> Originally I bought this for my husband who has thin hair and showers at night.  By next morning he already looks like he needs to wash his hair and often complains that other shampoos (including organic shampoo designed for the whole family including babies) makes his head itchy.  It works great for him, no more itch and his hair looks clean even when he comes home from work the next day.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give it a try since I have a lot of problems with shampoos too.  Well my hair can now be washed every other day instead of daily, and after just one use my hair has never been softer.  All I can say is wish I&#x27;d found it sooner.  I was really skeptical considering all the high priced big promises shampoos I&#x27;ve tried and been disappointed with but this is the real deal.</li>
    <li> Although this shampoo is more costly than others, I love this shampoo because it I have super greasy hair and have to wash my hair daily even when I shouldn&#x27;t. With this shampoo I do not have to wash my hair for 2-3 days. Makes my hair so much healthier! fantastic product.</li>
    <li> used this shampoo a few times and ii had a great experience with it.  my hair gets very greasy feeling after washing it.  ii have tried several different shampoos they worked for a while and then right back to the same thing ii can wash my hair no issues and then all of a sudden ii will wash one day and as soon as it dries it&#x27;s like ii didn&#x27;t even wash it  try it out you will not be disappointed</li>
    <li> I have really itchy and greasy hair and received this product as a gift about a month ago. This product really helps and my hair looks so much cleaner because of it! Definitely try this product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is absolutely amazing. My hair is very fine and thin and this shampoo does the trick! It reduces the amount that falls out and I can skip the poo for 2-3 days and just deep condition instead. It breaks down the build up and adds a healthy glow and shine.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! I have naturally greasy hair and after just one use of this shampoo I could see a difference! Thanks for finally coming up with a product for oily &amp; greasy hair that actually works!!</li>
    <li> I recommend everyone try this shampoo and all the othr products they have absolutely the best I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
    <li> Got this product as a gift &amp; I absolutely love it! Will definitely start buying it.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;This is a very good product. It leaves your head cool after use. Definitely degreased my hair. It could only become better by straightening hair, with its&#x27; natural ingredients.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with oily hair and often times people thought my hair was wet, when it was in fact not.  I would wash and wash my hair but still it looked wet and oily. I was not interested in trying the products you find in most retailers and wanted something natural to help take some of the oil out so that my hair didn&#x27;t look so gross.  Well this stuff worked tremendously, my hair looks great and I plan on continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have very oily hair. I shower in the morning and by evening, I can feel little oil beads right by the root of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried combing, brushing and scalp massaging in the shower - during shampooing, nothing changed. Looks like I have very active oil glands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying so many off-the-counter shampoos for oily hair, many with pyrithione zinc etc, nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After researching, I bumped into this product. I was hesitant to spend $18 for a little 8oz shampoo but I wanted to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works. Period. My hair feels great, fresh and airy. I can feel my scalp breath. Just a little amount in your palm, you get it all over your hair. It creates a thick and creamy foam, almost like those frothy face wash products. Washes off quick, leaves your hair lively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your hair won&#x27;t look shiny, it&#x27;ll look dry and unattended, but that&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. As a guy with short hair I&#x27;m totally OK with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is the price. No shampoo - no matter what brand or formulation - should cost $18 for a 8oz bottle.  What does 8oz mean? Just to give you an idea, the regular size head&amp;shoulders is 14.2oz and it sells for under $6.00 at Target. The larger ones with pump are 34oz. Walmart has them for $9.37.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand this is not a mass production Pantene or Dial bottle, but even the clinical strength ones are around $10 for 8oz size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a &amp;#34;hollistic&amp;#34; product, not a clinical lab in France, I think it&#x27;s way overpriced. I&#x27;d be happy to pay $18 for a 20oz, but it&#x27;s just overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Pricey</li>
    <li> Firstly, the shampoo smells great. I bought this product because my hair is VERY oily at the scalp but dry and damaged toward the bottom (I&#x27;ve been dying it blonde for many years now). I&#x27;ve been having quite the issue finding a good shampoo because my scalp flakes very easily and at the same time I cannot go more than a day without having to use dry shampoo or washing my hair everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for about 2 weeks, I saw a difference in the overall appearance of my hair. It looks much healthier and doesn&#x27;t grease as quickly as it used to! I loveee that they use the holistic route and it&#x27;s safe for my colored hair. I will continue to use and hopefully see a permanent long-lasting effect!</li>
    <li> My ten year old has extremely oily hair and dandruff. I have tried everything (including dish liquid - that&#x27;s how desperate we were!). So I did a little research which led me to this product. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. She has only been using this shampoo for almost 2 weeks and there is a huge difference already. I was hesitant to pay $17 for this since it&#x27;s not a huge bottle, but the results we have received have been totally worth it. I will continue to use this product and will update review if there are any changes.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE This product! great experience and makes my hair feel great!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!!! Leaves my hair actually feeling clean and soft. Will definitely be buying more!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. It does degrease your hair and Its good for sensitive scalps, but its kind of expensive.</li>
    <li> Worked beautiful results for my dry constant bleach hair. I wanted to repair my hair instead of chopping it off. So I constantly tried over the counter to organic hair mask. This shampoo beat the frizz off my hair with first wash it even feels soft just like in the salons but without the harsh chemicals and burning irons. You have to wash with warm water massage leave 5 to 10 minutes and introduce to colder water just like instructions says. My hair came out a little stiff but wait it till hair dry&#x27;s and comb and watch the softness come to life. It also came really fast. I can say I finally found my shampoo.</li>
    <li> OM Gosh!!  I have had a scar on my head that has itched for over 25 years and this shampoo COMPLETELY took the itching away.  I left my hair clean and shiny also.  This stuff is GREAT!!!  Really it is.  Julie Thomas</li>
    <li> I just received my order yesterday, so have used it 2 days.  I have fine oily hair and have not found anything to help.  I tried this shampoo for 2 days and can&#x27;t believe the difference.  My hair is no longer flat and the grease is so much better.  I am hoping with cleaning up my scalp with a few more washes, it will be even better.  I have tried expensive shampoos, and cheap shampoos, but this has been the best I have found.  I like the scent also.  My hair is naturally blond, so I like the lemon in the shampoo to help keep the color looking great.  Very happy with this shampoo.  Am looking forward to checking out other products by this company</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about two months now, and it has worked very well for me. I wash my hair twice with it in every shower, as indicated on the bottle, and it really helps reduce how oily my hair is. Itchiness has decreased, and I can now wash my hair every couple of days instead of every single day. It feels natural, and my hair doesn&#x27;t even fall out as much. Definitely recommended !</li>
    <li> I have oily, itchy, greasy hair so I thought this product would be perfect! I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a hair cleanser that cleans without stripping my hair of its natural oils.  I have tried conditioner cleansing (6 months -- too expensive and oily!) and washing with baking soda (1.5 years -- too drying and sometimes didn&#x27;t feel/smell clean).  So when I tried this product, I was quite happy for the first few shampoos (I shampoo every other day). But by the end of 2 weeks, my hair started getting more oily than it was when I was washing with baking soda. I think it&#x27;s because it cleans my hair and scalp too well so again I&#x27;m making more oil to compensate. Tonight, I am going to try mixing it with baking soda to dilute it because I do like how it cleanses, but after baking soda, this shampoo cleanses too well! It&#x27;s a delicate balance of cleansing the hair and scalp while not stripping it of all its natural oils.  Hopefully mixing it with baking soda will help. Can update this review once I&#x27;ve tried that.</li>
    <li> Fair, but overpriced.</li>
    <li> Love it! My hair feels so clean &amp; I can now wash it every other day! I would def recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about 1 week now. There definitely seems to be improvement with my itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been only a week or so I have been using this shampoo. It does remove all the oil from my hair &amp; scalp. But leaves my hair little bit dry. For now I am not using any conditioner with it. I have to shampoo twice to get all the oil out of my hair. The itchiness on my scalp is also gone. I am trying to skip a day to see how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;The product label on here says it has DMDM Hydontin but the unit I received did not have it on the label. My question to the manufacturer is; does this shampoo still has DMDM Hydontin? Please say it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Reason for 4 stars: very expensive. I don&#x27;t know how long I can purchase this.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle and I love it. I have very oily hair and I FINALLY  found a product that works. The smell is amazingly refreshing and my hair feels healthy and clean. I will definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Bought this shampoo to help clear up build-up/greasy hair.  After 1st use noticed a difference.  Hair seems easier to comb through and feels lighter.  Also like the natural smell.</li>
    <li> Really awesome stuff! Leaves my hair free from grease and smelling great. And best of all, my scalp is nearly itch and flake free. However, it does have a tendency to leave my hair a bit dry, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend washing every day.</li>
    <li> I have literally tried all the natural anti-itch shampoos out there over the years. I had been using Jason&#x27;s tea tree shampoo for the past years which does a decent job but quite drying. I gave these guys a try, and have to say, it is an excellent product and works nicely without being too drying. Excellent ingredients and herbal combination. Maple Holistics, please don&#x27;t mess with the recipe - the product is doing what you designed it for!</li>
    <li> I was looking for shampoo that sets me free from every day head wash. Don&#x27;t like my hair on the second day. I change my shampoo pretty often looking for the one, that keeps my hair clean longer. And this shampoo works so far, used it 4 times already. Hopefully my hair will not get used to this shampoo so quick and this good effect will stay for long. As long as I am going to use this shampoo more my only concern is price, i would like to get bigger volume for it.</li>
    <li> We use well&lt;br /&gt; Very pleased.</li>
    <li> It works!!! I love to wash my hair. Thank you so much good product!</li>
    <li> I have only been using for a short time, but this shampoo works great on my hair.  When I wake up the next morning my hair is no longer oily like it used to be.  I have tried many different shampoos trying to achieve this result.  Love it and will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Makes my scalp very itchy, and doesn&#x27;t help with the greasy hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this a week, and I&#x27;m hoping there will be improvement. So far I&#x27;m notexperiencing any of the amazing results is read in the reviews.  After developing a pretty severe breakout on my face and neck for the past couple months (i attributed it to my former shampoo), I broke down and ordered some maple holistics degrease. I am a 30-year-old female with four kids, and I really don&#x27;t like dealing with a new problem of acne scarring AND signs of aging at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is very small for the price (8 oz), and I have to use about twice the recommended amount for it to distribute through my hair. The smell is very mild and pleasant enough, somewhat lemony. My hair does not have the waxy buildup I was getting with other shampoo brands. So that is a pro. My scalp, however, still itches and the acne is still raging, things which I hope will subside after continued use. I will update my review if things change.</li>
    <li> Great project! My hair now is not as oily as before.</li>
    <li> I was told to give this a try because my hair is oily. I hope this works. If not I will make sure to come and let the community know my thoughts.</li>
    <li> The product is amazing and is perfect for the oily hair and the itchiness i had. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks and the results are brilliant. Although it didn&#x27;t help with the hair fall but my hair feels extremely alive, fresh and more thick than before. And just a small amount of it is enough even if you have long hair. The only disadvantage is that it&#x27;s expensive with the shipping.&lt;br /&gt;So i totally recommend it and will definetly buy it unless i find a place that sells it cheaper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so far, but let me tell you, IT WORKS. I am so so so happy. I have never had problems with my hair before until I moved a month ago to a new apartment. The water here makes my hair instantly feel greasy even right out of the shower when it&#x27;s wet. I tried a shower head that has a filter in it, and tried shampoo a salon recommended. Last resort I figured why not try this! And I could not be happier. One use and my hair feels 100x better! I have colored hair and have no idea what it will do to that in the long term, but it not being oily is really what I care about.</li>
    <li> It is okay but I don&#x27;t think it really helped out with my oily hair that much.</li>
    <li> Makes hair feel clean and it has a good natural smell. I gave it 4/5 stars because it is extremely expensive. I wish the company made bigger bottles or offered discounts for bulk purchases.</li>
    <li> This natural shampoo for oily hair works really well, and Im glad I found it here!&lt;br /&gt;Will not go back to the regular stuff now...big difference.&lt;br /&gt;will recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have very oily hair. I use this mixed with a little baking soda and it seems to work better than other shampoos I have used. The ingredients are all quality as well.</li>
    <li> My hair has a tendency to have an oily scalp and lots of build up from hard water from our shower.  I have a gone through numerous shampoos in trying to find a solution and came across this one and thought I had nothing to lose so I gave it a try and to my surprise it has actually solved my problem.  I do not normally write reviews but thought this may help someone who has a similar scalp issue as I am really impressed.</li>
    <li> After running out of my Framesi Oily Hair Shampoo which kept my hair pristine for a day, I was on the hunt to find a new shampoo. This shampoo caught my eye, and with the great reviews, I decided to give it a whirl. It is amazing. This shampoo cleanses my scalp like no other, and I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair everyday! My hair looks healthier, surprisingly, and so much more shiny. It brought back the life in my colored hair! I bought in combination with the Silk 18 conditioner, which I also really love! The only negative thing about this shampoo is that it leaves my ends feeling dry, but that&#x27;s nothing that the Silk 18 conditioner can&#x27;t fix! I can not wait to try more from this brand, it&#x27;s off to a great start!</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo for oily hair. It is perfect for what I&#x27;ve been experiencing this past few days. Really cleans the hair throughly</li>
    <li> I have thick, straight Asian hair that gets oily quickly, especially in the summer. By using Maple Holistic&#x27;s degreaser shampoo, my hair looks normal on the second day and it&#x27;s even fine on the third day with a few sprays of dry shampoo. With regular shampoo, by the end of the second day I really needed to wash my hair again. My daughter also experienced less oily hair with this shampoo, so it works for both of us. An upside is that our hair seems less absorbent, so drying our hair in the mornings is quicker. It lathers us well, and smells nice. The downside is the price, about three times the cost of regular shampoo, and the fact that you can&#x27;t just run to the store to get more. Guess we have to stock up!</li>
    <li> It works nicely.  I no longer have to shampoo every day.</li>
    <li> While the shampoo gets my hair pretty clean, I tend to get greasy really fast after using it. I got the shampoo to help with itchy scalp. My hair isn&#x27;t normally greasy, so didn&#x27;t expect it to get greasy after using it. I am disappointed, especially since it wasn&#x27;t cheap. I am still hoping it helps with the scalp itch, so I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> In a few words,its simply works!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Third day using it and my hairs not oily,my scalp isnt ichy anymore and my mild dandruff is gone!&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells great too,,only con is that i wished the bottle was a bit larger,but will be reordering.&lt;br /&gt;Its such a great feeling to find a product thats natural and actaully works.</li>
    <li> Disappointed, this shampoo does not help my oily hair, it actually makes it more limp and greasy.</li>
    <li> I have oily hair that needs to be washed daily.  Otherwise it feels heavy.  I have been using the Degrease shampoo for a week.  I love the smell and clean feeling after.  However, I&#x27;m not sure if it is &amp;#34;degreasing&amp;#34; my hair since I still have to wash daily.  I was hoping to maybe wash every other day.  I have to say I am not using a Maple Holistics conditioner so that may be why.  I will continue to use this product, maybe along with a matching conditioner (any suggestions?), and see if I get the results I am looking for.  I do wish it wasn&#x27;t quite so expensive.</li>
    <li> I Love  that shampoo. I have already ordered another bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also ordered and used the winter special shampoo. That is my favorite as you can feel all the mints cooling your scalp as you use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had searched Amazon for organic shampoos and found the Degreaser shampoo, after reading other reviews, I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly it could use a better name, it sounds like a laundry product, lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good thing it works well, it cleaned my hair well, but did  not strip out all the moisture!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all great products, keep up the natural work!</li>
    <li> I remember buying this some time ago and it cleaned my hair so I bought this again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works wonders. I have an oily scalp that would sometimes itch and I&#x27;d breakout near my hairline, front &amp; back. This was often times embarrassing because as a guy I typically cut my hair weekly and fade the back. Now as great as this shampoo is, I started a new regimen which so far has worked magically and I no longer break out at all and my hair looks great! I basically only wash my hair once or twice a week with this shampoo. I think washing my hair everyday was irritating my scalp. Everyday I shower, I&#x27;ll put a dab of Clean &amp; Clear continuous control acne cleanser with 10% benzoyl peroxide on the areas I&#x27;d typically break out &amp; massage it in. I&#x27;ll also wash my pillowcases weekly to avoid sleeping in any sweat. Since I&#x27;ve been doing this, I don&#x27;t breakout at all and my hair looks ten times better because it&#x27;s not dry from daily washing. With this shampoo, I&#x27;m going to stick with my daily regimen because as the old saying goes, if it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it</li>
    <li> did not work.  try nioxin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks. I love how this shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry my hair and makes my hair feel soft. I have oily scalp and I can&#x27;t go one day without washing my hair. This shampoo made my scalp less oily, but I still feel the need to wash my hair everyday. It&#x27;s a bit pricey for 8oz. of product, but a little goes a long way. Overall, I think this is a great daily shampoo and I would recommend this to everyone with oily scalp.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find that it helps to control the oil of my scalp but it doesn&#x27;t worsen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is the thicker than usual shampoo making it harder to pour out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of this shampoo. Also love that it&#x27;s botanical.</li>
    <li> Before I started using this product, I always put my hair up in a bun or a ponytail. I did this because I really hated how sticky and oily my hair felt. I&#x27;ve tried a couple of shampoo brands in the past and none of them really helped me with the situation, at least not permanently. This is the only product that solved my problem. I can now enjoy styling my hair because it no longer feels yucky when I touch it.</li>
    <li> Does not help at all. Just a regular shampoo. As a matter of fact made the hair worse than before.</li>
    <li> The is a great shampoo, if you have oily hair.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a degreasing shampoo for the longest time. But no drugstore shampoos came close. The price for this shampoo is a bit on the higher end. However, I was willing to give it a try because I&#x27;m running low on drugstore options. Plus, the reviews on here are very compelling.    I have been using this shampoo for two full days and I already feel a difference in how my hair feels. Usually when I shower in the morning, my hair would be greasy and oily at the end of the day. But when I used this shampoo, the hair felt light and dry all day, which is a big plus for me.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase.  The scent is very nice &amp; oily hair actually seemed clean &amp; oil free after shampooing.  Satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I still have an itch after using this product. After a day or two from the time I&#x27;m using this the itch comes back. Although it took away the greasy look, I don&#x27;t mind having that compared to having the constant itch.</li>
    <li> I have thin straight hair..This shampoo help with my oily and itchy scalp. My hair feels nice and silk with volume and will purchase another bottle!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now. I grab it when I go to wholefoods, and it usually averages around $15. A little over my budget but I really like the product. It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve found that smells/feels good AND works.&lt;br /&gt;Everything is more expensive online. If you have a store that carries this in your neighborhood - save your money and time and go buy it there.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, long, wavy Asian hair, and my scalp can get super oily. In the winter (I&#x27;m from the midwest so the winters are terribly dry and cold) my scalp would get so greasy that it would not even dry completely after I washed my hair in the shower. The ends would dry but the part near my scalp at the back of my head, particularly on the underside of my hair, wouldn&#x27;t get dry--it would greasy, like waxy greasy. Plus the day after I washed my hair my scalp near the front and sides would get super itchy and dandruff-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After much trial and error I found I was doing a lot of things wrong for my particular hair/scalp situation. Long story short, I started doing apple cider vinegar rinses, which completely rid my greasy scalp, but for a couple reasons, one cannot, nor should, rely on ACV forever. Fast forward a few months and it&#x27;s the end of summer and I&#x27;ve been messing around with various shampoo/washing routines for a while and have finally figured out what works for my scalp and hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair maybe every 3rd but usually every 4th day, and on that day I start by conditioning my hair, then wash it twice with one of my HG shampoos, then go in with a Shea Moisture shampoo, because I find these shampoos feel very stripping on the hair. I would consider this shampoo from Maple Holistics a HG shampoo if I hadn&#x27;t found the Aquage Vitalizing Shampoo. THAT shampoo is my holy grail shampoo for getting my hair %100, salon quality, clean feeling. It is everything. My hair does not feel greasy at all for like 2 or 3 days after using it. HOWEVER it is not natural at all and has a disgusting electric blue color. So if you don&#x27;t want to use a horribly chemically laden shampoo, and if your hair and scalp situation is similar to mine, then this one by MH would be the one I suggest! It&#x27;s really not bad at all, and hair and scalp get perfectly clean and not dry or irritated, which is what you want. I would shampoo and rinse twice, because this doesn&#x27;tlather very much. Also follow up with an extremely moisturizing shampoo if you feel like you need it because this one gives a slightly stripped feeling to the hair, like there&#x27;s resistance when you run your fingers through it in the shower. I will also note that if you contact the MH people through their website they will send you a good sized free sample (free shipping too) for you to try, which is absolutely lovely. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is simply because I found another shampoo that gets my hair cleaner for longer. But if you want an effective, natural, cleansing, yet non irritating shampoo, this is probably your best bet.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! At first, I balked at the price but I was desperate for relief. I have long hair but a small amount goes a long way so it ends up being a good value. I have very fine hair but a lot of it. It has a tendency to go flat. I also have hormonal issues which have wrecked havoc on my scalp. This shampoo has helped with the itchiness and overproduction of oil without stripping my hair. Don&#x27;t forget to shake the bottle before using as natural ingredients can separate. Another positive attribute is the fragrance. The rosemary smells amazing.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to spend almost 20 bucks on shampoo, but having an itchy scalp all day was driving me nuts. This shampoo keeps my hair looking clean for much longer than my 2 dollar &amp;#34;2-in-1&amp;#34; usual stuff. It was getting annoying... my hair would be greasy about 8 hours after showering.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo works much better at keeping my hair cleaner for longer. It is also helping with the red itchy bumps that I&#x27;ve gotten for decades. I don&#x27;t have to use the nasty smelling tar shampoo anymore!&lt;br /&gt;+Works great&lt;br /&gt;+Smells great&lt;br /&gt;+Natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;+Made in USA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Pricey but worth it!</li>
    <li> It has a cooling effect to the scalp and I like how it smells. A little goes a long way with this shampoo even for longer hair. My scalp skin felt a bit strange when I applied this shampoo for the first time. However, don&#x27;t be afraid if you feel this, too: this means that the shampoo is actually working and treats the scalp and the hair, as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything and had high hopes for this Shampoo but it really wasn&#x27;t any more effective than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  Maybe I have extra oily hair but I still have to rewash the next day.</li>
    <li> The shampoo smells ok, but I need to lather my short and very oily hair 2 or sometimes 3 times for it to feel clean. And even so, I got a lot of dandruff from it, too, and I didn&#x27;t have that problem for quite some time. My hair feels and looks greasy  and starts to itch way faster then with other shampoos.</li>
    <li> great things about this shampoo:&lt;br /&gt;1. totally cleans the oily hair, lifted my hair with body&lt;br /&gt;2. a little goes a long way, just a nickle size for my past shoulder hair&lt;br /&gt;3. great lather, add water as you work it in&lt;br /&gt;4. lasting fragrance has a beautiful earthy scent&lt;br /&gt;First natural oily hair shampoo that I recommend to do the job well.</li>
    <li> Following weight loss surgery my hair&#x27;s consistency became flat greasy and oily even immediately after washing my hair. After spending $150 plus on different shampoos that were supposed to cleanse my hair I stumbled upon this degreaser shampoo one night. Just 1 wash and I was hooked, a little pricey but it&#x27;s worth the money !!!</li>
    <li> I really have to add to my review on this amazing product. I really cannot rave about my new shampoo enough. I used to have very itchy, dry scalp with oily hair. I no longer have this and have normal hair once more. I can style my hair, wash and wear, and no longer find myself clawing my hair throughout the day from the dry ichtiness.   I&#x27;ve only just now ordered my second bottle, having ordered my first in February. I do wash my hair nearly every day, if not every other day. If you&#x27;re unsure whether or not to order, do it. Trust me. You will NOT be sorry. I&#x27;ve even begun packing the bottle with me when I travel, just so I can avoid hotel shampoo. Please, please, please don&#x27;t hesitate and try this shampoo. You will not regret.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! My hair is very, very curly and since I put many products in it (including oils), I decided to search for a clarifying shampoo! I read this product had all-natural ingredients and that definitely caught my attention since I usually don&#x27;t trust &amp;#34;all-natural&amp;#34; products... The bottle is small and a bit pricey, but there is no way you will get the same results with a cheaper product! This time I agree with the fact that you get what you pay for! :)))))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hair twice (with this shampoo), left it on for 5 seconds before rinsing, then rinsed it with cold water both times! Additionally, I put a mask for 15 minutes and proceeded with my hair routine! Do not get scared by the word &amp;#34;degreaser&amp;#34;!!!! It does not leave the hair hard, although its purpose it&#x27;s clarifying! Also, all you need is a little bit, so it will probably last long! I usually wash my hair every two days due to greasy feeling, but guess what? It&#x27;s day #4 and my hair still feels fresh, soft, light, and itch free (which was impossible before)! This product is a must-have and I absolutely look forward to buy my second bottle as well as other Maple Holistic products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you enjoy this product as much as I did!!!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that is extremely oily and I have recently had some mild scalp itchiness. I didn&#x27;t have dandruff and I don&#x27;t use mousse or hairspray very often so I knew those weren&#x27;t the causes. I figured maybe the regular shampoo (L&#x27;Oreal Volume Filler Thickening Shampoo) that I use was the culprit because my hair is so oily, I can&#x27;t really clean my scalp as well as I would like without scouring my skin with my fingernails. So, I found this shampoo online, read the reviews and decided to order it. It is a bit pricey for shampoo but I took the plunge. I have been using it for a few weeks now and I do like it. It has helped tremendously with the itchiness. However, it tends to dry the ends of my hair out more so than regular shampoo, which is why I gave it 4 stars. I do have to use a bit more conditioner on my hair than usual. The shampoo smells lemony and fresh, which I really like. My hair, after drying and styling, is softer and seems healthier. It actually gives me more volume than the volume shampoo that I was using, probably because the volumizing shampoo is filled with insane chemicals that coat my hair and actually weigh it down. This shampoo however is not free of sulfates, which I know is a concern for some. My hair is colored and the color has stood up well to this shampoo. I really recommend this for those with very oily hair. I think if you have normal non-oily hair you will find it to be over-drying. It came nicely packaged with a card explaining how to best wash your hair and the after care once you&#x27;ve shampooed your hair. It also had another card enclosed that detailed the ingredients in the shampoo that help with the oily and itchiness. The bottle is smallish, especially for the price, but it&#x27;s well worth the expense for the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> This product is everything it says it is.  I have very greasy hair and I am always looking for something to remedy the situation without drying.  I admit I was concerned at first about using something called a \\&quot;degreaser,\\&quot; as I was certain I would end up with horse hair.  It just sounds harsh.  However, it was not drying at all.  In fact, I did not even use condition for the simple fact that I wanted to get the full effect of the product unencumbered by anything else.  It turns out conditioner was not even needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have very thin, flat hair, so I was concerned about the tradeoff of switching to this and leaving behind my volume building shampoo and conditioner.  This was another needless worry.  I simply used this product as instructed and styled as normal using my other regular products and my hair was full, soft, and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past when I have tried these types of products they have smelled terrible and they would sting my scalp.  I became especially worried about stinging when I realized the instructions said to leave it on for 2 or 3 minutes.  However, there was no stinging sensation and the scent was herbal and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I have to recommend this product.  My scalp does not itch nearly as much, and my hair is definitely not a greasy.  This is a product that does what it says.</li>
    <li> A waste of my money! Do not buy. I&#x27;ve been using for over 2 wks and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference. My less expensive shampoo worked way better than this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered my second bottle of this shampoo. The condition of my scalp has seen improvement ever since I began using it. Before I started using it, my scalp had uncontrollable eruptions of pimples and now they are literally gone. I only get eruption once in a long while whenever I get nuts or other greasy foods. Although this product tends to cause dryness to the hair due to its degrease efficacy, I only use the conditioner at the lower end of my long hair, without allowing it to touch the top of my scalp, in order to eliminate any chance of exposing my scalp to the oil from the conditioner to avoid clogging up the pores on my scalp, thus reducing the chance of eruption.</li>
    <li> Very good for itchy scalp</li>
    <li> used for about 2 weeks didn&#x27;t work it works fine as a shampoo it just didn&#x27;t help with my oily forehead or itchy scalp    update:  I went back to using my old shampoo and noticed my head was slightly more itchy so I guess it helps slightly with itchiness for me it doesn&#x27;t stop it just makes it slightly less itchy at least I think so anyway</li>
    <li> I love this product ... My hair is greasy ... It&#x27;s works for me</li>
    <li> After using everything under the sun to stop my scalp from itching after one day, I found a shampoo that works.  I have gone 3 days between shampoos and had zero problems!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this shampoo twice already (been using it for a year now). It smells great and really soothes my scalp. I have oily hair and it really helps clear it up without irritating my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Glad I found this company. Definitely going to try some of their other products.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Before I started using this product I would wash my hair every morning and by 5 my hair looked as if I hadn&#x27;t washed it in days. Now I can wash my hair every other day and it still looks good.</li>
    <li> Added sheen to my colored hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews; however, I was very impressed with this product and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel lighter and it is helping me transition to washing my hair every other day!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 50/50 on this product. On one hand, it is WAY less harsh than typical shampoos, while still getting my hair (literally) squeaky clean. On the other hand, it&#x27;s harsh enough that I CANNOT use this shampoo by itself, I have to use a conditioner. It sounds like a small complaint, I know, but it tells me that to some extent this stuff is still harsh on my hair. Using only my homemade shampoo, I could get away with washing my hair 1-2x a week. If I use just this shampoo, my hair goes back to being a greasy mess within a day or two. (Chemical shampoos stripping oils cause your scalp to produce excess oil, making your hair more oily. It&#x27;s a vicious cycle.) HOWEVER, if I use this stuff in conjunction with [[ASIN:B00SG3BJ7G Argan Oil Conditioner - By Maple Holistics]], I have no problems. Overall, it&#x27;s a small price to pay.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  I purchased this because I had an itchy scalp and nothing else I tried relieved the itching.  I&#x27;ve used it three times now, twice with a very small amount of conditioner and once without conditioner.  Without the conditioner, my hair was impossible to manage:  flyaway, staticky and flat.  But no itching!  We&#x27;ll see what long term use brings.</li>
    <li> This is a second time I am buying it , I tried several shampoo some from drug stores and some from pricy salon , nothing worked until I found this one , it works , only problem it makes my hair dry so I use conditioner just for the end of my hair . I could not find anywhere else except amazon . Overall I am happy with my purchase .</li>
    <li> This is THE product to use if you have oily hair. I have not had hair that doesn&#x27;t resemble an oil slick by the end of the day in years. I have very fine hair &amp; this has worked wonders to nearly eliminate the excess &amp; unsightly oil from my scalp. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My scalp is still as itchy as before I purchased the shampoo, but my hair is not as greasy as before I suppose. I have mix feelings about this shampoo.</li>
    <li> The shampoo was leaking when I received the package. I have not tried the product yet, but it just looks cheap.</li>
    <li> I like the smell, and it seems to clean well, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a great improvement in how my hair does during the day.  Still gets oily.</li>
    <li> It is definitely not worse than Head&amp;Shoulders. Subjectively seems better. Requires conditioner after use. Small bottle can last for a couple of months if used every other day.</li>
    <li> It really cleans my hair when I am in the shower but by the end of the day, the oil is right back where it started. I was hoping that I would only need to wash my hair every other day or not have oily hair late in the day with this product but that&#x27;s still impossible.</li>
    <li> I have straight oily hair, this works for me</li>
    <li> It is really hard to find a good shampoo for oily hair and I can&#x60;t remember how many I have tried before this one. Works great, not only leaves hair fresh and clean but also doesn&#x60;t dry out the scalp. Bottle might look a little small but shampoo is very thick so will lasts for a long time. Beside, now I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair every single day. So far, the best shampoo I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> My hair gets very oily and is curly (odd combo). I hate using harsh products to deal with this issue. This product worked GREAT!!</li>
    <li> I love it! my hair and scalp feels less oily and i love the smell</li>
    <li> Does not work.. It makes my hair even oilier 😏</li>
    <li> Works as described but don&#x27;t use more than twice in one week or it will dry your hair out too much.</li>
    <li> Hello&lt;br /&gt;My name is Costache Cosmin,, I live in Romania, this product literally  change my life,, in the past 3 month I had some problems with my oily  hair, I&#x27;ve tried every single shampoo on the market, nothing worked. My best friend recommended this product, he had the same problem as me, now thanks to this shampoo I can finally enjoy life without .people looking strange at me in public.I got rid of the itch and now I have silky  hair  and healthy scalp, I gladly recommend this product, thanks!</li>
    <li> My wife and I both have hair that gets really oily within a few hours of washing. We both tried this and will not go back to anything else. It is by far the best thing we have ever used and keeps our hair from getting oily for several days with just one wash. Yes, it is a bit pricey but it is definitely worth it. I would recommend this to anyone that is annoyed with their oily hair and I will continue to be a repeat customer of this product.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this for weeks. The new natural shine to her hair is visually recognizable and I&#x27;d like to thank Maple Holistics for this. She&#x27;s tried commercial shampoos, but they didn&#x27;t work as effectively as this one.&lt;br /&gt;I use their tea tree shampoo myself, and I&#x27;ve been recommending this company to some family members. This kind of quality is hard to come by.</li>
    <li> Not really happy with it. It smells ok, hair feels clean after but only the first day.  Itchy and greasy by second day.    ★★update★★   this product really works well, but don&#x27;t expect results right away. Took a few weeks before I realized my scalp wasn&#x27;t itchy and greasy anymore. Really like it now!</li>
    <li> I like that it uses more natural ingredients than most other shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;I have very short hair so I mainly use this to keep my scalp feeling refreshed and smelling good.&lt;br /&gt;My only beef is that i wish there more of a fruity/peachy to it as that was one of the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Come to think of it, it didn&#x27;t have much of a fragrance.</li>
    <li> Finally a product that works great for oily hair!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo because I was looking for a natural solution to my oily scalp and greasy hair. I am 29 years old and have had greasy hair and and an oily face for as long as I can remember. I was taking Spirolactone prescribed by my dermatologist but had to take a break as I am trying to conceive. As the medication wore off, my hair began to return to its previous state--limp and greasy. This shampoo has helped so much! I massage a quarter size amount into my scalp and leave it for several minutes, then rinse and repeat. I do not use any conditioner, I just rub a dab of Moroccanoil to the damp ends (My hair is about shoulder length). My hair stays soft and clean for about 24 hours (On the medication I could go several days between washes but as it wore off I would wash my hair in the morning and by the evening it would be greasy again). I love the soft, relaxing scent and the product lathers nicely. I have not noticed any new breakouts from this shampoo. I would recommend this product and will purchase again. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have always had dandruff and an extremely oily and smelly scalp since I was little. Nothing worked -- Head and Shoulders, Neutrogena T-Sal or Gel, prescription shampoos, apple cider vinegar, not washing hair for a week, etc. I would always have to wash my hair everyday, especially in the mornings. Even after washing, my hair would slowly start becoming greasy and smelly after a couple hours. Once I started using this shampoo, I noticed a difference. Not that the problem is completely solved, but it&#x27;s helping! My hair has definitely gotten a lot less greasy and smelly during the day. I have noticed a lot less flaking. I even received a rare compliment the other day -- that my hair smelled good! I have only been using this product for two weeks now, and so far it is working.</li>
    <li> This stuff is magnificent and has saved my hair. It lathers wonderfully and has a very pleasing scent. As soon as I rinsed it out of my hair, it already felt more manageable. It combs/brushes easier, dries light, fluffy and shiny. It also stays clean for the next day so I now only have to shampoo every other day. Please don&#x27;t ever stop making it!</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo to help control my oily hair and it&#x27;s done wonders! I wanted to buy a shampoo that did not have unsafe and unnecessary chemicals, but was still effective. I really like the smell of the shampoo, it left my hair feeling clean, and I also enjoyed the texture too. The shampoo lathered well and I didn&#x27;t need alot to cover my shoulder length hair. I am very happy with it!</li>
    <li> My hubby had problems with his skin on his head and caused to have a sort of blisters and hard bumps.  He also had very greasy and itchy skin.  He tried all sort of ointments from doctors and couldn&#x27;t get rid of it.  After reviewing 15 some different shampoos and comparing the ingredient, I picked this one according to what essential oils were supposed to do.  He used it every morning for 2 weeks and his skin is back to normal.  I&#x27;m very happy with the product and be buying again.</li>
    <li> I tried this shampoo based on reviews, as my hair suddenly became greasy at the crown, even right after washing! It seems that I was suffering buildup from a popular hydrating shampoo. The Degrease shampoo worked immediately, restoring the shine and body to my hair. I hadn&#x27;t realized how poorly my hair had started to look! I&#x27;m very pleased with this shampoo and am eager to try the companion conditioner (silk 18). I will also note that I suffer from itchy scalp....not dandruff...and have noticed that I&#x27;m not constantly scratching my head!!!</li>
    <li> I tried this shampoo with hopes it would help both me and my teen daughter. My hair is thin, wavy, and oily. Hers is very long and very thick, and her hair near her scalp tends to get oily very fast, as well as a few bits of dandruff despite the oily scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the shampoo didn&#x27;t seem to help or hurt, but for my daughter, after one use I was amazed. If she showers at night, the following morning it already looks like it&#x27;s been a day or two since she last washed her hair. She used Degrease during one of her evening showers, and the following morning her hair was still silky and clean looking. Her hair is very pretty anyways, but after shampooing with Degrease the length also seemed shinier than usual. I french braided her hair that morning for a softball tournament, and where I usually find it feeling oily at the roots and a some flecks of dandruff, It was nothing but shiny and clean feeling. No flakes, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this review if things change, but for right now I am very pleased with the outcome of her hair. Still searching for me, though.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used. It cleans very well and my hair is soft without added oil. I have short hair now so I don&#x27;t need any conditioner. Wonderful product. Thank You so much.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product based on reviews here on Amazon and i was not disappointed.It works great and have only natural ingredients .I reorder it again and would definitely recommend to every one i know.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great!  My hair feels soft and is super shiny.  I used it with the Silk 18 conditioner from maple holistics and my hair feels better than the Kevin Murphy $80 angel wash &amp; rinse I was using for my fine, thin, highlighted hair.  I need to wash my hair everyday or it looks super oily, I&#x27;m so happy I&#x27;ve finally found a great shampoo/conditioner combo</li>
    <li> This shampoo works really well on my daighters oily  hait</li>
    <li> This is a truly wonderful product, we love the natural ingredients and it does a beautiful job of keeping the oils in check! I would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this product and so far am pleased.  I have been looking for YEARS for a shampoo for oily hair and it is always surprising to me how few products on the market address this problem.  I also have been wanting to move toward more toxin-free products and was thrilled to find Maple Holistics and their mission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used the product for two uses, so can&#x27;t say for sure if it&#x27;s going to fix my greasy hair problem (so far, it seems about the same), but I have noticed that my fine, thin hair is much smoother and manageable after only these two uses.  I normally have fly aways and therefore use a straightener, but haven&#x27;t had to straighten my hair since starting with this shampoo.  My hair also has more natural volume than usual.  So even if it doesn&#x27;t completely fix the oily issue, I will continue to use and recommend it for these reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applaud this company for their efforts to avoid the use of sulfates and other chemicals.  I look forward to trying more and more of their products!</li>
    <li> Great for my oily scalp! I have an oily scap but extremely dry hair (after bleaching). This shampoo does not dry out my hair, but cleans my scalp very well. I also like the consistency and feeling that its natural. Cannot use shampoos with hard chemicals after this shampoo. The price is the only cons for me-the bottle is relatively small.</li>
    <li> My hair goes from balanced, to a little greasy, to I have to wash it every day, but at the end my hair isn&#x27;t even make it to the end of the day. I was using cosmetic products for so long, it was a pleasant relief to find this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my adult daughter who has very greasy hair. Not only does this not work, it made her hair worse! She washes it every morning, and by afternoon it is greasy again. Smells good, but do not believe the hype.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband since his hair looks greasy by the end of the day.  After a couple of days of using this shampoo he got through the day and didn&#x27;t have greasy hair!  He ran out and switched back to his usual shampoo and right away it was greasy at the end of the day, so we bought another 2 bottles and will stick with this product!</li>
    <li> I never, care to leave reviews. But I figure that with products like cosmetics, which people usually buy based on its reviews (because everyone says theirs is the best), it&#x27;s worth posting a mark. Really good product right here, I am going to buy more in the future. This is my new shampoo.</li>
    <li> I Love This Product.  It was best of best product compare to other products  that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this product to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;I can really feel difference right after I wash my hair w/ this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I feel good after using this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I will use this shampoo forever.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many kinds of shampoo for oily scalp/hair with no luck. I have also gone through &amp;#34;low poo&amp;#34; periods, hoping that my scalp eventually self-regulates its oil production with a long interval between shampoos. NOTHING WORKED UNTIL I TRIED THIS SHAMPOO. I felt so much difference immediately after the first use. My scalp felt fresh and clean. That feeling stayed following day. On the third day, my scalp still felt clean. I went without shampoo for 3 full days, without that greasy, nasty feel. With other shampoos, I had to wash my hair every day which dried my thin long hair. I will stick to the Degrease shampoo unless my scalp and hair condition drastically changes.</li>
    <li> My scalp is no longer so itchy nor as greasy. There are still some symptoms but hopefully they will continue to improve with time. Comforting to know that the formula is herbal although I realized there was something slightly off about the smell and I just realized it is the smell of the basil oil.</li>
    <li> I bought this few weeks back and have been using it daily upon receiving this item.    Pro  It really helps with oily scalp.  For typical oily scalp, just pour some shampoo on your palm, massage into wet scalp, leave on for few mins and rinse off is enough. For very oily scalp like mine, I repeat this whole process twice.    Con  Not so much for itchy scalp.  It does help with oily scalp but only for up to 24 hours, after which I have to wash my hair again. *But this is for very oily scalp*    I did contact the seller to ask what are the preservatives used as I don&#x27;t see any preservative listed on the ingredient list. The reply I received was \\&quot;It is to my understanding that the nature of the ingredients are anti-microbial and therefore act as natural preservatives.\\&quot;    When I ask which ingredient act as anti-microbial, I was told that he will retrieve this information for me and that he would need a few business days to contact the lab. Well, this was on Dec 3rd.    When I contacted them again on Dec 9th asking for an update, I was told on Dec 11th that \\&quot;I&#x27;ve submitted your inquiry and am awaiting a response from the lab.\\&quot;    I just contacted them 3 hours ago asking for an update.  The response was \\&quot;We are not allowed to send third-party links through Amazon Messaging. Contact us directly for a speedy response.\\&quot;    It seems asking for a report on their claimed anti-microbial activity without ANY preservative is going to be a long dragging process.    Overall, it does help with oily scalp, not so much for itchy scalp and I have doubts on a water-based product that has anti-microbial activity without any preservatives, but that&#x27;s my personal opinion.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the fragrance of this shampoo or how it left my hair feeling flat and heavy with residue. I had high hopes given the price tag but overall it was no more effective than shampoo&#x27;s like Head &amp; Shoulders Citrus Breeze which costs a fraction as much and is also tailored for oily hair.</li>
    <li> This Shampoo relieved my irritated, itchy scale in seconds. The rich lather it works up does wonders! My scalp feels clean and moisturized even after I air dry! I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> As described the product seems to work. If nothing else my scalp feels great after using it. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have extremely oily hair and I&#x27;ve tried multiple products but this is the only one that worked for me. It rinses clean and smells and feels clean until after your next shower.</li>
    <li> The perfectly balanced scalp is what I got out of this and what is now a part of me. After the first use, I noticed 80% at least of my greasy, crusty, sebum scalp was cleaned up. It felt amazing. Since the audience here is greasy-scalp and hair peeps or loved ones of such a condition so common; you know what I&#x27;m saying.&lt;br /&gt;Now here I am, 6 weeks into this product and I love it! I enjoy reading the ingredients list, knowing all this good stuff is keeping my scalp and hair fresh and simultaneously itchless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I simply use as directed on the bottle and let it do it&#x27;s work on my scalp. I will say, since I daily use a Curve hair-sculpting product for stylin&#x27;, I probably don&#x27;t get the full, long-lasting, non-greasy hair effect. But I do love how my scalp feels. It&#x27;s not completely de-greased (as I think that would in-turn equivocate to Dry McFly), but I can tell the deep cleansing occurs with each wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Give this a try -- it&#x27;s a great company and definitely worth the money. &amp;#34;Keep on Keepin&#x27; on&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have now been through two bottles. If you can get over the yucky sounding name &amp;#34;Degrease&amp;#34;, it definitely works.  I have very oily thinning hair and the more hair I lose, the worse the condition becomes.  When I use Degrease, I can usually get a full day without my hair getting to limp - unless I am doing something physical.  My only minor beef is that the shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave my hair with much body the way other shampoos do, thus my hair tends to fly around in the wind a little more.  Overall though that is a distant second to be able to go a full day without looking like a greasy rag doll.  I would recommend the product and I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Great product, leaves my hair clean and fresh smelling without the harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this shampoo.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t help much as the so-called statement on advertisement</li>
    <li> I was hopeful with all of the good reviews that this would be the answer to my oily hair. Alas, I noticed no difference while using this shampoo. It&#x27;s pricey so I probably will not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I usually have to wash my hair every morning. This is the first shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used that I can wash my hair the night before and the next day it is soft and clean and not greasy for the entire day. I really like the smell as well.</li>
    <li> once in a while I&#x27;ll treat myself to something like this. it makes my hair feel great. unfortunately i cannot buy this every two months but occasionally I&#x27;ll &amp;#34;pamper&amp;#34; myself</li>
    <li> This shampoo keeps my daughter&#x27;s oil hair somewhat under control.  The only problem is that it has a fairly strong tea tree oil smell.  The smell does dissipate over the course of the day...but it is a little strong at first.</li>
    <li> Good morrow, sirs. I am here to tell thou of my experience with thy Degrease shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;But in all seriousness, as a young man who happens to be experiencing hair problems and I don&#x27;t know why, I got this from their website (which is more expensive) and I must say! I don&#x27;t have any light dandruff, my hair is getting bolder and my head is no longer as oily as a bike chain.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo shall slay away any oily dragons which infest your head!&lt;br /&gt;Brave on, adventerous knight!</li>
    <li> This is a great product from this new company. The shampoo works great on everyone in my family who has oily hair. Our hair is now less oily and this shampoo has proven to work. We use it every day and it has decreased oil levels in the hair and it has strengthened the hair. We like it also because it is an all natural product. I recommend it to anyone is having problems with oily hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo for my 11 year-old daughter who has recently developed very greasy hair which is typical for many girls of that age.  I wanted something gentle but also something that would make her hair shiny again.  This shampoo did the job.  We are very happy with it and will order again.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> It does what&#x27;s supposed to do; satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> This is a refreshing change from most cheap, commercial dandruff shampoos. It smells better, and it feels better that I&#x27;m using an all natural product! After several washes, my itchiness completely went away, and my hair is soft and healthy. Even if it didn&#x27;t have other terrific qualities, the smell alone is good enough to buy it! I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I am not at all satisfied with this product. I have bought it first time because I started coloring my hair and thought I would get a color safe shampoo. While it is true that it does not strip hair of color, the major drawback for me is that it tends to straighten my waves and I hate it.&lt;br /&gt;I usually wash my hair every 5 days and I have done so for years. But once I started using this shampoo, my hair would become so straight and would stuck to my scalp that I would need to wash it again on the 3rd day. Well, no, thanks! I will not buy again. Will keep searching for another color-safe shampoo that preserves my waves.</li>
    <li> First thing I noticed was after using this shampoo hair loss diminished. I use natural henna on my hair and it took much longer for the henna to be washed out as henna may be better for your hair it doesn&#x27;t last as long as OTC hair dyes. My hair just has a over all better feel and texture. I love it.</li>
    <li> Leaves ends very dry and hard to get a comb or brush through it.  I have thin long hair with oily scalp after about 12 hours after washing it. Thought this would be great but very drying to the ends of my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo based on reviews, as I had tried other shampoos for oily hair that had not helped at all. And the very first day I used it my hair was not oily anymore! My scalp was also itchy and I had dandruff, and all of this has also disappeared! So I&#x27;m really happy with it and I recommend it!</li>
    <li> works well smells really good. i recommend this to people suffering from oily hair. i started to use it for a while and it regulated my hair back to normal so its not oily anymore even if i use a different shampoo.</li>
    <li> Bought this after reading all the great product reviews.  Wonderful product for my itchy, oily scalp.  Use it with a scalp brush and only on the scalp (shampoo is for the scalp, conditioner for the hair).  Leave it on for a minute or two and rinse clean.  Can go 2 days without washing!  Highly recommend product along with other great products from Maple Holistics.  Will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> This shampoo really helped. I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve held off writing a review to really give the product a lengthy try. I&#x27;ve had oily hair/scalp my whole life. However, the past 2-3 years it&#x27;s really amped up, not in a good way. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s peri-menopause, hormones, psoriasis, or all the above. I&#x27;ve tried every shampoo out there for dandruff, itchy scalp, etc. None of them really made an appreciable difference. They may have exacerbated the oily, itchy problem. So a few months ago I found myself on amazon once again, searching for something new to try. Anything to help with the itchiness. It has gotten so very untolerable. The itching leads to flakes which leads to embarrassment- if you suffer from flakes and itching, you know this drill well. I was ideally hoping for a complete solution to help what I *think* is psoriasis- and was initially looking at the tea tree shampoo by maple holistics.  Almost on a last min whim I decided to go with the degrease shampoo- I hate the name by the way, it&#x27;s  somewhat repulsive to think of degreasing oneself. Anyhow as my overwhelming issue the night I was browsing- has been itchiness, I&#x27;ve been desperate to find something to give some modicum of relief. I can stress enough how horrible the itching has been the past few months- I&#x27;d completely curtailed going out in public as much as possible. The itching has lead to scabing in some areas on my scalp and serious pain, both physical and sadly, emotional. It&#x27;s a horrifying humiliating problem. Maple Holistics shampoo for oily itchy greasy hair really surprised me.  I did buy it based on the positive reviews but still I was skeptical. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and it has made a huge difference in the itch factor.  I have a definite reduction in the amount of itching. It&#x27;s not gone completely but I&#x27;d say conservatively it&#x27;s about 80% better! I have less build up of scaling. It&#x27;s not gone, it&#x27;s not a total solution but my god it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve tried thus far.  No change for me in the greasiness- I still haveto shampoo daily, but I&#x27;ve always done that my entire life, so it&#x27;s not a drawback and certainly not a reason to discontinue use. I am thrilled with this shampoo. It has an interesting scent- I&#x27;d describe it somewhat like a Pine/Redwood forest after a rainy day. I find it pleasant although I&#x27;d prefer something more floral- again, that&#x27;s just personal preference as a woman.  The one thing you should know, especially if you are a woman with med to long hair- this shampoo leaves my hair horribly tangled. I also bought the silk conditioner and I love it! It smells fabulous but I&#x27;ll leave a separate review for it... just know that you MUST use a conditioner, or you&#x27;ll be tearing your hair out trying to comb/brush through it. I will definitely continue using this shampoo and will also try the tea tree shampoo to see if it can help with the flaking/scaling and maybe a combination of the two shampoos will help control my problem a bit more. Overall, I am very happy with my results so far, after using the product daily for the last month. A+</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife because of such an oily hair issue.  Her hair (naturally blonde, now platinum blonde color treated) is oily within five hours of bathing.  After using this the first time, her hair is nearly oil free after 24 hours of initial washing.  Secondly, her hair now glows. Literally, it&#x27;s shiny, shimmering, glamorous and has such a healthy glow I can&#x27;t stop gazing at her :)</li>
    <li> I find it tangles my hair after washing, but it does control the oil in my hair. I just uses it on the top of my hair, and another shampoo for the rest if the length. I will probably look for something else.</li>
    <li> I bike everywhere and am a naturally sweaty person, so I wasn&#x27;t sure how well this product would hold up, but I was pleasantly surprized. At the end of a long day, my hair still feels rather clean.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions precisely and I used it every day for over two weeks and my hair is still oily.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great! I have had oily hair for years. I could not find any store bought materials that helped. This cleared it up in one week and also got rid of my dandruff. I use it every day or else my hair returns to the oily state.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for almost a week and my hair feels more clean and full. It definitely has cut down the oil in my hair! It doesn&#x27;t have much fragrance but that could also be a good thing since it doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp in any way.</li>
    <li> Best product I ever tried, really helpfull. Works great for oily hair, my hair has never been the same. My friend one day came up to me and said try this shampoo and I loved it , it smells great feels great and looks great . Everyone should have one in there home</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m having scalp issues after having a baby. I was hoping this would help balance the pH, but after two weeks, nothing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two months now, wash my hair 2-3 times a week, hair is greasy on day two typically. Was hoping to get more time between washes. Probably won&#x27;t be repurchasing :(</li>
    <li> I have rather problematic oily hair and the shampoo worked for me great.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great!! It is the only shampoo that won&#x27;t kill my hair, but also will allow me to not have to wash my hair everyday!! I love it!</li>
    <li> This is great product. My hair usually gets oily in a matter of 2days, now I can take showers without having to wash my hair everytime!! LOVE ❤ IT!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo I don&#x27;t have greasy hair per say but it is very fine and gets flat by the end of the day. This shampoo really makes it shiny, soft and thicker feeling. I like how my hair feels when I use it . Doesn&#x27;t lather really big but your hair feels immediately thicker even when wet . I notice it takes twice as long to dry , don&#x27;t know what that means for my hair  but it does.  No bad smells either just smells and feels clean.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different shampoos and this is the only one that I have tried that works-improves the texture and controls oil-smells amazing too!!! Wish it didn&#x27;t come in such a small bottle</li>
    <li> I have such oily hair, I have tried everything. Then I was told about, Maple Holistics so I.decided to give them a try and I love it, no more oily hair.</li>
    <li> Great for everyday or every other day washing.  I gave this shampoo to my mom who has been suffering from oily and greasy hair all of her life.  She does not believe in chemicals and has even resorted to washing her hair with vinegar and water.  When she tried the shampoo, she loved it.  Said it made her hair soft and her scalp stopped itching and did not feel irritating.  I am a definite believer!</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product immensely. Please purchase this.</li>
    <li> i purchased this product a few weeks ago,i have used three times.  i want to say i love it very much because my hair is getting more and more better.As is well known to all, chinese people like to eating spicy food and  hot pot(in chinese it called &amp;#34;huo guo&amp;#34;),so many of their hair are very &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;.I had bought lots of shampoo for my oily hair,but i have not got any positive effect at all.So far the  negative things are the size for the price and the smell which can only keep a short time.so i give four stars</li>
    <li> I have relatively oily hair but its often very itchy after I shampoo. My first impression of the shampoo was that it smells great! Very herbal, and the strongest scent for me was the rosemary. I found that I didn&#x27;t need to use as much shampoo as the bottle suggested (I have shoulder length hair) and about a dime-size portion was enough for me. It lathered well and distributed easily along the scalp, something that most of my sulfate-free shampoos do not do. My hair was definitely squeaky clean afterwards, and no itch! My hair was left clean, soft and smelling good. Absolutely love this shampoo and look forward to trying more of their products.</li>
    <li> I just received this product and used it for the first time. I have to say I love it so far. My hair feels pretty soft...I used conditioner this time after using the shampoo. I may try it without conditioner next time to see if there are any differences in the feel of my hair. If I don&#x27;t need conditioner then I will skip it and just use this shampoo. My hair tends to get oily after two days which is why I wash often. I hope over time this shampoo will help decrease frequent washing. I am hopeful!!</li>
    <li> I found I got a lot of dandruff recently.So I searched on amazon to find a good shampoo. Great reviews and so many buyers brought me here. After two weeks use,my condition did not turn around. I still got a lot of dandruff and my hair is still oily as usual. For a shampoo cost that amount money? Really?Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves this!</li>
    <li> My hair is very oily and wanted to try this shampoo after seeing all these good reviews. Just after first wash, my hair felt soft and non-greasy and feels good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is the price and the quantity. For the price you are paying i feel the bottle quantity is very small and lasts only for few washes.</li>
    <li> It smells very good, but it isn&#x27;t that foamy. As a result, I feel like I have to use alot. Your hair feels great for a next 10 hours after you wash it. Haven&#x27;t seen its effect through the days.</li>
    <li> It has a natural good smell. It dows make the itchy and red bumps go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair is a little dry without using conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep use it to see the long time results.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff wish I could get another bottle!!</li>
    <li> This is my first review ever on any website, for any product, period! I am a 31 year old female. I began fertility treatments in Dec 2012 and in May 2013 became pregnant. Since I began the fertility treatments back in Dec, I have gotten red itchy bumps on my scalp, which naturally, I picked at all the time! Not just that, by the hair by my bangs were thinning out, I assume because of the itching. I don&#x27;t know if I have just developed a sudden allergy to regular shampoos, or if I now have psoriasis, or if it&#x27;s hormonal, but all I know is I tried so many shampoos that claimed to hydrate, zinc to heal, etc, and none worked for me except the Maple Holistics DEGREASE shampoo. I think the antibacterial agents in this stuff works wonders! I tried the Moisture one too, but it did not work as well for me - it was good on moisture, but the bumps were still alive and kicking! I tried to stop using it after my first bottle ran out, as it is a little pricey, but within a week the bumps were back! So I now use nothing but this stuff and try to keep a spare bottle at all times so I do not run out. It completely gets rid of all issues, including the thinning hair since I don&#x27;t fuss with my scalp anymore. I don&#x27;t know how I will be after I have my baby, but so long as I have issues, I will use this product. Website says not to use when pregnant, but my DR. said it was fine.The product is definitely worth a try. If you have success like me, you will be hooked - how could you not be with great results! just glad I&#x27;m finally spending my money or something that works.</li>
    <li> After using for several days I have noticed some improvement. Will continue using the product. Fresh smelling and squeaky clean hair. Be sure to follow directions on the bottle.</li>
    <li> I have had issues with dandruff and oily hair for a while now. My dandruff used to be really bad but after using their dandruff shampoo and brushing my scalp really well before showering that was mostly aliviated. However my oily scalp issue still stood. I was really surprised at how well this shampoo worked. Before I limited my showers to every 3 days or so but honestly day 2 and 3 were usually suspect. ANWAYS - I immediately noticed a difference when I started using this product. My hair doesn&#x27;t start to get oily till day 3 or 4 provided I not touch my bangs and use little product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give you some reference I have wavy hair that I&#x27;ve been coloring for years and sensitive, dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General hair thoughts/advice - brush your scalp THOROUGHLY before showering - it makes such a difference! Get all that dead skin off of your scalp so the shampoo can penetrate. When you use the shampoo make sure to massage it into your scalp (I massage for about a minute), leave it on there for a few minutes, massage again (not sure of necessary the second massage is) and rinse. Also, obviously only use shampoo on your roots and conditioner on your ends - how people still don&#x27;t know that in this day and age blows my mind.</li>
    <li> Gentle, effective, null scent, this leaves my hair clean and full of body.  It does not strip oil from your hair.  It balances the scalp gently.  I love this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having a problem ever since pregnancy with the crown of my head STAYING oily. It would not go away no matter what I did. As a final hope, I ordered this and IT WORKED! The smell is fresh and clean without being overwhelming, my hair isn&#x27;t too dry and not at all oily! I can wait a day in between washes if I&#x27;m pressed for time and I just couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product. So happy I&#x27;ve found the cure to this annoying issue!</li>
    <li> This is not the very best that I&#x27;ve found.  It worked to clean my oily hair and it took two washings (as the instructions say).  I wash it every third day and no matter what shampoo I use, I wash my hair twice doing the top and then the underside separately both times (a lot of work, I know).  I found the consistency of Degrease to be a little thick for spreading, which seemed to reduce the lathering as well.  I am aware that it is sulfate free, but some lather is good for picking up the oil and washing it away, this was just thick.  I have found another shampoo that is less expensive, thinner in consistency (but doesn&#x27;t drip through your fingers), lathers well and is also sulfate free: Giovanni Certified Organic Golden Wheat for Normal to Oily Hair Shampoo (Eco Chic Technology) and found it at Whole Foods for $8.  The great thing about Whole Foods is that you can return it after trying it, so its a great avenue to try something new. I hope that helps!</li>
    <li> Scalp feels so much better. Keeps hair clean longer and looks shinier and healthier.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, did not work for me.  My hair is very oily at the roots and the rest is very dry.  My hair did not feel clean when I used this shampoo, and it was very tangly.  I wish it had worked, as I love the ingredients and fresh scent.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo. It works good for what I want it to do. My hair feels, and looks much better. Also, I like the natural smell that it has.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampo I&#x27;ve ever used . I have extremely oily hair and this is the only shampoo that makes my hair feel clean. With other shampoo my hair would still look greasy after a shower . My hair looked like it hadn&#x27;t been washed in weeks. Since I started using this shampoo I&#x27;ve been able to shampoo every other day instead of daily.</li>
    <li> My daughter has been struggling with oily hair since last 3 years.  I have tried branded shampoos and conditioners for her to help treat her oily hair.  But nothing helped.  She had to shampoo her hair every day and yet wake up the very next day with greasy hair. She was very-very frustrated with her hair.  Also, I had to be very careful in picking up shampoos and conditioners for her since she is allergic to sulpha and some other chemicals that are found in large number of beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my quest to find a solution&#x27;s to this frustrating situation, I discovered Degrease shampoo by Maple Holisitcs few days ago.  I was impressed by its customer reviews and by the list of its natural ingredients.  I received the shampoo in mail on Tuesday.  My daughter used it the same day.  She woke up the following day with shiny non-oily hair.  Today is Friday and she has not yet felt the need to shampoo her hair.  What an amazing result!  Both she and I are super impressed to have finally found a product that shows the results that it promises.  I will be ordering more stuff from Maple Holistics.</li>
    <li> Good product. Cleans oily scalp very well. My hair was less oily after using this product and it has good smell too. Provides moister too. Hair wont be dry. I am satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for me.  My scalp gets very oily.  I&#x27;ve been using dandruff shampoo but this is a very nice change up.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> First of all, I have thin, fine hair that easily gets greasy and oily looking this is despite washing it daily. It doesn&#x27;t help that my hair is naturally straight. I have tried spray products to use between showering to deal with the greasiness with little effect. This is the only product that I have found to help, The shampoo smells delicious and leaves my hair feeling silky and soft. I can also skip a day of shampooing and my hair still doesn&#x27;t get oily. I love this product and use it daily!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo!!!  I&#x27;ll never switch.</li>
    <li> I recommend this to people that have oily hair and itchy works well</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo doesnt dry my hair out. Help with itches and oily skin.</li>
    <li> My hair gets extremely oily, so I tried Maple Holistics Shampoo for Oily, Itchy &amp; Greasy Hair &amp; loved it!  Makes my hair feel so clean &amp; my hair esp around the roots is not oily &amp; greasy looking.  I recommend this product to everyone with oily hair.</li>
    <li> I never tried this product before cause its a little pricey for me, But after reading what others have to say, I willing to give it a try,since I do have very oily hair and have tried other products that claim to give me the same results, but didnt, if anything it made my hair worse.</li>
    <li> I have really thin and sparse hair. Within a day, my hair would be oily and have itchy scalp, so i would wash my hair everyday. Also, I lose lots of hair whenever I wash hair. I have tried many shampoos, and nothing seems to work. When my friend told me about this product, I was skeptical but gave it a try anyways because there was so much good comments about this shampoo. I could say this shampoo &amp;#34;REALLY WORKS&amp;#34;. Now I could go 2-3 days without washing hair and it won&#x27;t be oily. Scalp is not itchy anymore and lose very little hair. This product is great. I would definitely recommend this product to all my family and friends.</li>
    <li> If your looking for a shampoo that actually does what it&#x27;s supposed to, look no more! My hair was so greasy I had to wash it 2 a day with other shampoos! Now I can go for days without needing to shampoo! Added bonus for me, no more itchy bumpy scalp!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for a while and I think it is a good one. I work out a lot, so I&#x27;m pretty sweaty and greasy at times. This product works great, and I like the smell. Not all perfumy.</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo. Makes my scalp feel wonderful!! Would recommend if you have any scalp problems..</li>
    <li> I just received this shampoo a week ago. I saw a difference after the first use. With other shampoos my hair would be disgustingly greasy 24 hours or less after washing it. After using this product I have found that I can wash my hair every other day. On that second day I have used a little bit of dry shampoo for volume (and as insurance that I can make it through the whole second day without my hair looking oily). I am assuming that the longer I use this product, the more it will help my scalp not to overproduce oil. This product does exactly what it says. After using the shampoo the first time I also noticed that my hair was shinier than ever. The only things that I don&#x27;t like about this product are:&lt;br /&gt;1) The price of course, but with fewer washings a bottle will likely last a while.&lt;br /&gt;2) I do not care for the scent of the shampoo. It isn&#x27;t repulsive or anything, it just isn&#x27;t what I prefer to smell. With that being said, the scent is strong in the shower, but quickly dissipates so I really don&#x27;t smell it once my hair is dry.&lt;br /&gt;As you can tell, the negatives are few and very insignificant. I&#x27;m planning on sticking with this shampoo. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it appears that the company is very dedicated to customer service. With my order I received a card that said if you were not satisfied for any reason at all that they will either help you find a more suitable item from their line or give you a full refund. If you are like I was a few days ago, trying to decide if this shampoo was too good to be true, you can go ahead and try it yourself... no worries.</li>
    <li> It is not a miracle worker shampoo, but it is an ok product.</li>
    <li> It is a bit expensive but I found that it worked wonderfully.  However, now Head and Shoulders has come out with a much larger product that works just as well for OILY hair and is less than 1/4 the price.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait until I used this product three times before reviewing.  I have had VERY greasy hair since I gave birth.  I have tried many types of clarifying shampoos and none worked for me.  I shampoo with Degrease twice and let it soak both times.  I do not use conditioner and I rinse with cool water.  This is the first time I have felt like my hair is &amp;#34;squeaky clean.&amp;#34;  I could tell right away that it worked.  After blow drying, my hair is a little frizzy but I wash my hair at night and by the next morning its nice, full and soft.  It also smells great.  I can even go a few days without shampooing now, which I never thought was possible.  It is a little expensive but it is definitely worth it for me!</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo two months ago. I didn&#x27;t want to just write a review after one using it two or one time. My hair is so oily, I wash it in the morning it starts greasing at night. I have tried a lot of shampoos before but most of them consisted of a lot of chemicals and i felt guilty every time i use them. However, I did a research about this shampoo and found out that their ingredients re not harmful and mostly organic. after using it for the first week my hair didn&#x27;t get greasy at the same day. My hair is not as greasy as before. I felt that it starts to grease the second day at night which was a huge improvements. after two months of usage, I can see the improvement in my hare. I wash my hair every other day rather than every day. I recommended this shampoo to my mom and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter.  It works really well - it removes the oil, but doesn&#x27;t strip her hair.  Leaves her hair soft and manageable.  She loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a really strong rosemary scent, which one of our cats loves - she jumps into bed at night with my daughter and rubs her face and rolls her body in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  Lainey clearly thinks that my daughter has liberally applied cat nip to her hair.  Fortunately, both girls enjoy it.</li>
    <li> So far this product has work well. I just need more time to see if it works in the long term. It also arrived as expected.</li>
    <li> When I first bought this product, after first use I had a great experience, scalp felt clean and refreshed, it wasn&#x27;t itchy and the product smelled great too - I even reviewed it as 5 stars. Now, after using it for a month or two I&#x27;ve broken out all over my scalp, causing severe itching and now scabs. My scalp is red and irritated and I have a constant urge to want to itch. I&#x27;m not over using it, I wash my hair every other day and I am only exclusively using this shampoo. I am very displeased because I had high hopes after my first use.I loved it,recommend it,is a must,best product out there brand you can trust.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!  It makes my head feel less heavy and fresh !!!</li>
    <li> After trying a lot of OTC as well as prescriptive products from my dermatologist with limited degrees of success I tried Degrease for my oily and itchy scalp.  I found it to be more effective overall than any of my past shampoos. It has almost completely eliminated my itchy scalp when used daily and leaves my hair manageable without the need of any conditioners.  It has only reduced the oiliness of my hair to a small degree.  Because of that I could not give it 5 stars.  It is a product that I can recommend and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> For anyone who has a rash, sores, burning sensation on their scalp  this will help. I love the smell of spearmint. It&#x27;s very mild on the scalp. Do follow the instructions and leave on for a short time, to give the product time to work it&#x27;s way into the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I saw a number of favorable reviews for this shampoo, so I ordered it.  This is one of those shampoos that has &amp;#34;shake before use&amp;#34; which makes me skeptical to begin with.  The shampoo is so thick that it&#x27;s almost impossible to mix it by shaking the bottle.  I have thin hair and an oily scalp.  This shampoo did not help.  It briefly relieved the oily scalp, but my hair became very dry.  I only wash my hair on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday, so it was not like I was over using the shampoo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo did a really good job at cleaning my daughter &amp; my scalp.  My daughter has seb derm and this shampoo removed the scaly patches though out her scalp. I could see them braking down while I gentle massaged her scalp.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the shampoo on her she was able to get 5 day hair before the scales &amp; itching returned. The shampoo is a little drying to the length of the hair so a good conditioner will be needed. I myself don&#x27;t have oily scalp I used the shampoo to clarify my scalp &amp; followed up with a deep conditioner. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Does not live up to its advertising. It left my hair more oily and did nothing for my itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this shampoo. It&#x27;s the only one that helps with my scalp and yet doesn&#x27;t strip my color away. Note that it does leave your hair feeling a little different (coarse?) immediately following the rinse, but conditioning afterwards alleviate this. My stylist said my hair was the softest and healthiest she had ever seen it.</li>
    <li> I have a thick head of stick-straight hair that will go from fresh-washed to oily within about 8 hours.  I tried this product and my hair is now beautiful (yeah, I&#x27;m a dude who just referred to his own hair as &amp;#34;beautiful&amp;#34;).  I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell, but after a morning wash, my hair will not be oily until the next morning.  The more I use it the better it gets.  Great product that is highly recommended!</li>
    <li> this is not for doing it by your lonesome in the shower. this is a shampoo, and a good one at that. I saw the label wrong but hey, it cleans well, so no complaints.</li>
    <li> This is such a great shampoo!</li>
    <li> Nice smell, nice shampoo but overall it didn&#x27;t do much for my oily hair</li>
    <li> This makes me feel my hair more. I want to pass my hand through my hair more because of the smooth and sleek texture it now has compared to the old oily one.</li>
    <li> I could have found out a bout this sooner when i was dealing with such a greasy hair. this really works well in the act of removing grease from my hair through application and rinsing aka shampooing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different shampoos for my oily hair and scalp over the years with some success but mostly disappointments.  Degrease is different in a couple of ways.  It works.  It works without drying my hair or harming my scalp.  The herbal scent is pleasant and not over powering.  Being that it utilizes organic ingredients and not harsh chemicals, I feel comfortable using my shampoo daily and love the way my hair is now.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo! A product that is refreshing and natural. The Maple Holistics line of products are based on quality. This shampoo is definitely a quality product. A+++ Recommended</li>
    <li> The Natural Treatment For Oily Hair Shampoo is great. I have oily hair and most shampoo&#x27;s for oily hair still leaves me washing my hair at least twice a day, but the Natural Treatment for Oily Hair Shampoo is so good that I only have to wash my hair once a day and sometimes I can go two days. The fragrance of the shampoo smells clean and fresh. You only need to use a small amount of shampoo as it lathers quickly. As you massage the shampoo into your scalp you will start to feel a cleaning effect. Once I finished washing and drying my hair, I noticed a clean shine to my hair. There are no oily feeling. I recommend the Natural Treatment For Oily Hair Shampoo by Maply Holistics for anyone who has oily hair. It is the best shampoo that I  have found ever for oily hair.</li>
    <li> I liked that it stopped the itching I had. A lot of times I had itching right after a shower with this I did not! It didn&#x27;t make me feel heavy either. The aroma is decent. Not my favorite but okay.</li>
    <li> This has been one of my favorite prosucts, I have not used it for long but my grandma showed it to me and got me hooked. The smell is amazing and using a little bit goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. I have such oily hair and this is the only product I&#x27;ve used that actually works!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a little hesitant of specialty shamppos, but I decided to try this because of the great reviews.  All I can say is this stuff does not disappoint.  It really cuts the oil and helps control it all day.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, but it doesn&#x27;t take much to do the job.  I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching everywhere for a good shampoo that would not make my hair so oily and finally found it with \\&quot;degrease\\&quot; shampoo. I can now skip a day without washing my hair!  Note: consumer must follow the direction in order for it to work. I love it so much, I&#x27;ve recommended to others who also love this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I had oily, itchy scalp, this has improved my scalp condition immensely. This is also helping with breakouts, I have not had breakout on my hairline which other products cause. Hair smells clean and fresh and I can go longer without washing my hair. Will look into getting conditioner for dry ends. A high price but definitely will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a week now. I have very greasy hair, and have tried everything. This product was great at sucking the grease look out, and making my hair feel really clean. The smell, however, takes a bit of getting used to, but its not something that would lead me astray from the product itself.  It is difficult to leave it in your hair for 2 minutes through while in a shower, so I would recommend maybe washing your hair separate to get the full affect.</li>
    <li> My husband had extremely oily hair and scalp.  He has been developing red, raised bumps on his scalp that itched and he asked me to find something that would help clear it all up.  I Googled &#x27;best shampoo&#x27; and Degrease came up to the top of the search.  I came on Amazon to read reviews and researched other sites.  This product looked very promising.    Maple Holistics offers a free sample to those who send in a request and I did so.  I received the sample in a timely manner and my husband tried the shampoo as instructed until the bottle ran out.  Not only is his hair and scalp much less oily, the red itchy bumps have also cleared up completely.    He asked me to keep ordering this shampoo.  He is very picky about his shampoo choices and he thinks this is a winner.    2/3/2015 Update:  Not only is the product excellent but their personal customer service is amazing!</li>
    <li> I got a shampoo couple days ago.I washed my hair and after only one use I could feel the difference.My hair was soft,full and easy to manage.This staff works great and does what it says.I will highly recommended to everyone with thin,frizzy and greasy hair. Thank you Maple Holistic for this product.</li>
    <li> Amazing. I will always have this shampoo in my collection from here on out. And so will my sisters. My hair looks and feels healthier and cleaner, and looks and feels healthier and cleaner, than with any other shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. It smells great and you can feel the difference before you even get out of the shower. I am so impressed with this product. My hair has more volume at the roots and just looks so great. My experience with this company and products has been so positive that I&#x27;m excited to try and use more of their products.</li>
    <li> After dealing with overly oily hair after like 12 hours I started looking on amazon and I came upon this. It didn&#x27;t work for me at all, I tried using it for 3 weeks and only used it twice a week, as to not dry out my scalp. It instead gave me terrible psoriasis. I have now shaved my head and move to something that has been working AND healing my scalp now. It&#x27;s called t/gel by neutrogena, give it a shot if this doesn&#x27;t work for you. Plus this &amp;#34;degreaser&amp;#34; thing doesn&#x27;t smell all that great.</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical, but I purchased it anyway because I was tired of washing my hair everyday and be greasy by the end of the day, some days, if I was going out I had to wash it twice a day, that&#x27;s how bad it was. Now, I&#x27;m at my 3rd bottle, and I LOVE IT. I wash my hair every other day and sometimes even every third day (with a little help from dry shampoo). I recommend it 100%.</li>
    <li> I used to have to wash my hair every morning-- even just sleeping on it overnight left it greasy. I tried everything: using no conditioner, using dry shampoo, baby powder... the list goes on. I honestly thought I&#x27;d never find anything that could help my greasy hair! But this shampoo has totally changed my life (seriously)! This shampoo allows me to wash my hair at night, giving me more time to spend with my newborn son each morning before I leave for work-- that precious time is well worth the cost! In fact, this product worked better than I had expected-- now, I can get at least two days out of one wash. Sometimes I can even go three days without washing my hair! What I love most is that this shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair. In fact, because I&#x27;m able to wash it less, I find that my hair is now softer, shinier, and more manageable. The only advice I have for first-time users is to follow the instructions on the bottle; you definitely don&#x27;t need more than a quarter-sized amount to wash with (even for longer hair like mine), and I have found that repeating the wash really makes a difference.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my teenage daughter. After trying Many shampoos for oily hair the results were always the same. Her hair looked wet from the scalp down. We tryed blow drying, washing everyother day. Nothing seem to work. She was having to wear her hair in a pony tail everyday. Found this shampoo on  pintrest. When I  was looking for a solution for her hair. Decided to give it a try. The results have been amazing!  With each wash her hair looks better and better.  No more Wet look. She wore her hair down this whole week. She has used it everyday. She  Has already asked to order more. When I tell you that we must have at least 8 different brands of shampoo,  I am not  exaggerating. I can&#x27;t tell you how happy my daughter is to wash her hair and have it come out looking normal.</li>
    <li> my hair lives again. after brutal treatment for 2 months for a play, now I have to return to a normal color and hair health. this is really helping.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, but bottle was leaking a tad. I used it and it doesn&#x27;t really do what it says it does. I switched to regular head and shoulders and it works better. Unfortunately I expected more</li>
    <li> Degrease saved my hair.  I *love* this shampoo, and for my hair type and water condition, it&#x27;s worked the absolute best. I have been using the shampoo consistently for the last six months, and I just opened my second bottle. Over time and consistent use washing my scalp, it has reduced the general oiliness of my scalp and ear area, and my hair has stopped thinning and falling out. I would definitely recommend this shampoo for folks that have similar challenges that I faced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair type: Fine, thin, long straight hair&lt;br /&gt;Scalp: Oily&lt;br /&gt;My water condition: Very hard&lt;br /&gt;Frequency: I wash my hair every day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For background, I found this shampoo after I tried using numerous SLS free shampoos. SLS free shampoos tend not to work for me. After using them, over time, my hair gets greasy and waxy on the top and frizzy on the bottom. I *do* have a shower filter, I *don&#x27;t* use any styling products (no hairspray, mousse, gels or anything else). I *do* have hormonal imbalances caused by stress and perimenopause.</li>
    <li> Wearing wigs really strangle my hair. but this helps repair strangle damage for a relatively cheaper price compared to going to the salon for a hair treatment.</li>
    <li> I do recommend this product to others with greasy hair. My hair turns into oily strands and separates, this shampoo made my hair stay non oily for a greater amount of time as compared to my last product. The smell is great and stays in your hair throughout the day. I do wish that this product is also a healthy conditioner to straighten curled hair.</li>
    <li> Since I received this shampoo, I&#x27;ve been using twice daily, &amp; I like the feeling of cleanness &amp; freshness it leaves on head! I know it will take awhile to really get rid of my itchy &amp; greasy hair, but I feel I&#x27;m headed in the right direction! So I&#x27;m continuing to use this shampoo, &amp; hoping for the best! I&#x27;m very pleased so far! Thank you very much!!</li>
    <li> So far after 3 or 4 uses I really do like it.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed an difference instantly.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was smoother, less greasy, and no more dry scalp!&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels healthier all around. I&#x27;ve bleached and dyed a lot in the past so this really was needed.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair. My hair gets really oily within a day after I wash it. I had tried many shampoo and none works. After using degrease, i don&#x27;t have to wash my hair everyday and the key thing is that my hair is not oily. The only thing that i don&#x27;t really like is that my hair is dry after wash but its manageable.</li>
    <li> Satisfied with product. Best shampoo I ever had thus far. Soli deo gloria</li>
    <li> Finally found a shampoo works for my oily hair.  Hair stays clean longer after using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> My hair gets oily in less than a day whenever the season changes and this shampoo is a life saver.  Not only it helps to keep my oily scalp under control, it also keeps my scalp calm.  My skin and scalp is very sensitive and itches easily but I have no problem with this shampoo at all!</li>
    <li> Amazing! I actually thought I would have to cut my long hair becuase it was so greasy all the time. Even after shampooing it a few hours later my scalp would be ichy, the hair would be greasy, and the ends would be dry. One shampoo with this and I could feel a huge difference. It only gets better too because the condition of your hair only improves the longer you use it.</li>
    <li> If you have oily/combination skin and a greasy scalp; this shampoo is definitely helpful. My husband loves it and he has a shaved head. He has super oily skin and this shampoo has even helped him to feel much less greasy. Smells good too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about a week. I am still washing my hair everyday,out of habit, but I could do it every other day with this shampoo. The best thing about this product is that I don&#x27;t have itchy scalp anymore. The bottle is small but I don&#x27;t have to use that much per wash and I think it will last.  My only complaint is that my hair does feel a bit dry, but it&#x27;s nothing that a good conditioner can&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is wonderful. It feels good on the scalp, slightly tingly but not so much that the smell burns the eyes like a lot of other products that I&#x27;ve tried. It smells slightly medicinal which I believe comes from the French Cypress overtones and basil undertones. But it sure gets the job started for the healing process. My scalp was very itchy and painful before I started using this product. There wasn&#x27;t a shampoo that I had tried that ever seemed to heal my scalp. Everything else was just a Band-Aid. I&#x27;m sure the itch and dry skin were caused by hormonal fluctuations,however, it had gotten so bad that washing my hair just seem to make it worse. It took about three times of using Degrease for my scalp to feel like it was finally healing. I have since switched over to The Teatree shampoo which has maintained my healthy scalp. My hair is shiny and bouncy and just overall young looking. I use this in combination with the silk 18 conditioner which is also amazing. I have naturally curly hair and I need very little if any product to maintain frizz free bouncy curls!</li>
    <li> For years I thought I had dandruff, and used all kinds of different shampoos to help with the problem, but none of the dandruff shampoo&#x27;s really worked that well for. It wasn&#x27;t until I did some research on scalp conditions, and found out that I most likely had an oily scalp, and that oily scalp&#x27;s are breading grounds for dandruff, so i looked up shampoo&#x27;s for oily scalp, and found this one which I like alot. It lathers up really good, and seems to be doing a good job at keeping the oil at bay.</li>
    <li> I got acquainted with this shampoo through a friend of mine. One great characteristic of this shampoo is that it removes the oil without making the hair too dry. So far I am so happy with the shampoo and I think that it is definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> forget the smell i was willing to deal with that but after 6 weeks of use my hair is still oily as ever!! the bottle is small and cost a lot of $$ but again i was willing to try it if it would have done what it says it would . very disappointed! l</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Hair is definitely less oily than it used to be with the same amount of washing. Only barely, though.&lt;br /&gt;Organic ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;Not as expensive as many other organic greasy hair remedies&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;That it&#x27;s not more effective.</li>
    <li> This product really works.</li>
    <li> I just recently tried this product to see if it would help relieve my scalp itching.  I color my hair and as a result have a sensitive scalp.  The common products available at the store have not been helpful but this shampoo really felt soothing on my scalp. My hair looks and feels better than before.  Give the product a try if you have issues with your scalp.</li>
    <li> This organic shampoo effectively cleansed my oily scalp. Although I had to wash it every other day to keep it from getting too greasy, my hair felt very healthy, and it looked a lot shinier! It would have been nice if my hair would stay clean for another day, but on the whole, I found it to be a great shampoo for those of us with oily scalps.</li>
    <li> Been using it for about a week now and I love the smell and more importantly my scalp is less itchy. It is a good product and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned the shampoo this week. While it did seem to help with the extra oil on my scalp, I was not happy with how drying it was to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******&lt;br /&gt;Well this stuff is certainly a degreaser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have trouble with excess sebum production on my scalp and face, and this shampoo definitely removes quite a bit of the unwanted oil. However, it also leaves my hair a dry feeling the day after using it. It&#x27;s not terrible, and tends to get back to normal feeling after a day (which is all the time it takes my scalp to make up for the missing oil). I didn&#x27;t have much problem with scalp itch, except after about 3-4 days without washing my hair (and I figure at that point I deserve it), so I&#x27;m not sure I can address that aspect of the product. By the way, I have fine hair which I heat-style 2-3 times a week and shampoo about that often as well. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo as weekly deep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What did disappoint me (and what I had wished I had looked at before ordering) is that despite being called \\&quot;natural\\&quot; from \\&quot;Maple Holistics,\\&quot; the second ingredient of this shampoo is sodium laureth sulfate. All the other shampoos I buy are sulfate-free (which honestly greatly improved my scalp-itch that I used to suffer from before making the switch about 3 years ago). While this isn&#x27;t a huge deal breaker for me, I probably won&#x27;t be purchasing this shampoo again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $17/bottle, I&#x27;d hope that it would be less stripping on my hair and be sulfate free.  Just a word of warning. Last time I get sucked into buying \\&quot;natural\\&quot; shampoo without inspecting the ingredients. Ah well.</li>
    <li> Love it, my hair is no longer oily and looks great.</li>
    <li> I have been having issues with very oily and greasy hair and have tried several different products, even WEN. This product is great!! I love it. Normally my hair gets greasy/oily within a few hours, not with this. I&#x27;ve included some pics. The first in the red shirt was my hair after 2 hours of a wash with a deep cleanse shampoo. The other pics, in the black top, is after just 1 wash with this product. My hair was clean! Felt clean and was just amazing!</li>
    <li> I have very thick and often very oily hair. Since becoming pregnant the oiliness has reached all new levels. I would wash my hair, and as I dried it, I could instantly tell that it was still greasy. Throughout my pregnancy, I tried numerous shampoos and natural remedies and nothing was helping.  In my last trimester, I decided to try this shampoo because I just felt so gross. It really worked. I can now go two days with wearing my hair down and another day with it in a pony tail before having to wash again. Three days without washing my hair was unheard of before. I do hate the smell though, but that I can live with over gross hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very oily hair and this is the first shampoo she has used that has balanced her hair and scalp!  We are both so pleased to find a product that actually works and doesn&#x27;t contain harsh, drying chemicals!  She uses the shampoo with the Silk conditioner and we will definitely buy both again!</li>
    <li> I have purchased Maple Holistics Degrease Shampoo for about five months.  My hair is oily and I have tried many shampoos.  Even when shampooing my hair every morning with other shampoos, I would have to also shampoo it at night as well.  I was looking for a more natural shampoo and found Degrease&lt;br /&gt;after searching online.  I love this shampoo.  I now only shampoo my hair once daily and would probably not even have to do it that often.  My hair has great body and does not separate into oily strings.  For those of you who have extremely oily hair, you will understand what I mean by this.  This shampoo does not dry out my hair.  It feels very conditioned even though I don’t use a separate conditioner.  I plan on continuing to use this shampoo for the foreseeable future.</li>
    <li> My hair gets greasy very often and I have been looking for shampoos &amp;#34;for oily hair&amp;#34; in the nearby grocery stores for a while, but to my surprise, I have never been able to find one. So I searched for it online, and I found this shampoo on Amazon, and so far it has been quite good, in the sense that it reduces oil, without making the hair too dry. I think it is worth the price and it is great for those who have greasy hairs.</li>
    <li> Impossible brush my hair after shampooing. Hair very freeze unhealthy looking.I stopped to use it!</li>
    <li> All my life I have dealt with oily hair. This is one product that has really help me control it. A little dab is all ti takes for a head full of suds. It has the clean refreshing fragrance of rosemary and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY shampoo that can handle my adolescent son&#x27;s oily, dandruff-prone hair.  It smells great too - love it!  The seller quickly answered a question and provided helpful options for future product ordering, and you can&#x27;t beat that!  I plan to order from this seller again and again!</li>
    <li> I give this shampoo 5 star rating because it is one best products for oily hair I&#x60;ve ever used. I use it as my primary shampoo daily, it is foamy and has decent fresh smell. Now it takes longer for my hair to get greasy so I would recommend this shampoo to anyone with oily scalp. It works great!</li>
    <li> This is a very good shampoo. It gently cleanses my scalp without any irritations! It is not too strong unlike regular shampoos in the market.</li>
    <li> Tried this shampoo after hearing about the advantages of not using a Sodium Lauryl Sulfate shampoo (hard to do).  Really pleased with the results with fine hair that tends to be oily.  If I didn&#x27;t wash my hair every day with my old shampoo, it looked like someone dumped a tub of lard on my head.  I find with this shampoo, I can go a second day and my hair looks normal.  It is so gentle that it is my go to daily (or almost daily) shampoo.  I do still use another shampoo when I want to mix it up but always come back to this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I carefully wash my hair twice a week.  It is at the shoulders and I have taken good care of it for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I have tried many shampoos on my hair over the years.  Last year I tried Degrease for my first time.  It has made my hair the cleanest and fullest of all the shampoos I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rest under the hair dryer with a good magazine to read!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paula</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo a couple weeks ago, and it works so good!!! My hairs are not so oily like before!!!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! I&#x27;ve tried a ton of cleansing shampoos that just dry out my hair and scalp but this one somehow gets my hair nice and clean while keeping my scalp moosturized.</li>
    <li> It works!!!. Thank you so much good product!</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for 2 months.  My scalp is less oily and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;It is somewhat pricey, but it is worth it to try.</li>
    <li> Great product overall! The smell is very soothing and enjoyable. I felt the difference after 1 weeks use. I would have gave a 5 star review, but $20 for a 10oz bottle seems a little high.</li>
    <li> At first, I was skeptical as the first few days of use left my scalp feeling itchy.  But then I realized that I needed my oily scalp to adjust to the normalization process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To date, I am exceptionally happy with this product.  I can go for two days now without having to wash my hair; and even if I do wash my hair everyday, the shampoo will not excessively dry out my scalp or hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying another bottle for my 12-year-old, who also has a very oily scalp.  We both will no doubt continue to be two of this company&#x27;s most loyal customers!</li>
    <li> I rarely leave reviews for products unless there&#x27;s 1) something wrong or 2) something that needs to be said. I don&#x27;t understand why this product is getting mixed reviews. This is a LIFE CHANGING product. I repeat, LIFE CHANGING. My once oily, greasy, heavy hair is now completely oil free, shiny, soft, light, and fluffy! Use it as directed (lather, rinse, repeat) and you&#x27;ll experience similar results. After 1 use I noticed an immediate and dramatic difference. My hair won&#x27;t be greasy for days after using it, even if it&#x27;s slept on or put in a ponytail. I swear it feels like I just got out of the salon. If you&#x27;re hesitant on buying this product, don&#x27;t be. Spend the money (it&#x27;s not a lot) and get salon-quality hair. The product is NOT drying (use a conditioner afterwards!) and it smells great. I&#x27;m in love with this product &amp; will be ordering more shortly. You won&#x27;t be disappointed, I promise!! I would give it 20 stars if I could. BUY IT</li>
    <li> Way over priced for nothing great..</li>
    <li> For a year I have had to deal with an ichy and oily scalp, it made me just want to shave all my hair off. The shampoo cleaned all the buildup and now my hair is soft and oil free :)</li>
    <li> It did not work for me. I usually wash my hair before going to sleep. My hair is still greasy in the morning after 1 night of sleep. I wish it has more fragrance in it.</li>
    <li> It is a great shampoo</li>
    <li> With the mostly rave reviews, I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.  It seems to work great for the first half a day or so.  But beyond that, it seems on par with other shampoos that I&#x27;ve used for &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; hair.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s natural, but well, I still cannot get away with not washing my hair everyday, which is what I was hoping for.  My hair still looks like someone rubbed olive oil through my hair the next morning.  It&#x27;s possible that this shampoo is stripping all the oils out, but my body just produces too much, which means that in due time, the oils are back in my hair.  I guess I might need an oil repellent shampoo.  Oh well.&lt;br /&gt;For another point, even though it&#x27;s expensive, a small amount does go along ways, so even though it&#x27;s a small bottle, the cost to buy the equivalent cleaning power would probably be about the same from products from Target or the like.</li>
    <li> I could never find a shampoo that worked for my hair. By the end of the day it always looked oily and felt it too. I started using this shampoo and it has made my hair feel SO clean. I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the smell (or the name) at first but it grows on you and is worth the results! My hair looks so light and clean when I dry it now (after the recommended air dry time). Not only that but my hair looks clean longer, I don&#x27;t wake up with oily hair in the morning anymore and it holds it volume throughout the day. Anyone who is tired of trying brand after brand definitely needs to try this, you wont regret it! The small bottle is one down side, but it really goes a long way and despite my ridiculous amount of hair I don&#x27;t have to use more than the recommended quarter sized amount.</li>
    <li> I have oily hair and this works</li>
    <li> I was a little sceptical because I&#x27;ve tried several shampoos that were supposed to help my oily hair and itchy scalp, with no luck. This shampoo is a little pricey but it&#x27;s totally worth it. The bottle is pretty small but a little goes a long way. I have shoulder length hair and had to wash my hair every single day. I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost three weeks and I have already noticed a difference. Now I wash my hair every other day and could probably push for every third day. My scalp feels much better too. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and I&#x27;ll definitely re-order it.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair clean, very clean but didnt work for smelly scalp.  I had to go back to Jason anti dandruff shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have tried many shampoos and conditioners over the years.  Oily, greasy, hair, scalp itching, and flaking has become worse as I have become older.  Past experience, using other shampoos has been disappointing and often times even made the problems worse.  These products have contained a large amount of sulfates and other man-made ingredients.  Maple Holistics goes to great trouble to explain that this shampoo does not contain sulfates, and only natural, organic ingredients instead of man-made ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;It works! Yes, it costs a little more than other shampoos, but you can tell after the first use, that this shampoo is different.  It provides the results it claims!  You can spend alot more, for alot less.  In addition to controlling the problems of greasy, flat hair and itchy scalp, this shampoo leaves your hair soft, clean feeling and manageable.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a part of my scalp regimen to combat adult cradle cap which is described as a fungal attack on the scalp.  My hair appears to be growing back.  No sure if the combination of my scalp treatment products are working in conjunction, but something appears to be working.  My hair is beginning to grow back, no more new bald spots.  Now all I need is a product that will loosen ingrown scalp hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve sampled many sulfate-free hair products before finding the Maple Holistic line. I wish I had found them earlier. I was actually not too impressed by this shampoo at first and switched back to  my then-favorite product after finishing the first bottle. But when I started to notice an increase in fallen hair in my shower and an irritated scalp, I realized how much this shampoo has been helping me and went back to this shampoo. I have been using this shampoo for a few of months now that I think I can honestly give it a high rating. I would also recommend the Silk 18 conditioner to go with this.</li>
    <li> This is the first shampoo I have ever found that addressed my hair and scalp oily condition.......with every other shampoo, I would end up with the &amp;#34;greasies&amp;#34; by 5pm the same day.........with this product, I can enjoy &amp;#34;just shampooed hair&amp;#34; a little longer.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Just ordering my second bottle. The shampoo has made my hair so much less oily. I can actually shower prior to bed and still have fresh hair in the morning. It smells good, and it lathers well.</li>
    <li> My daughter had been itching and picking at her scalp for months.  The dermatologist recommended that she regularly shampoo.  We tried many shampoos.  This shampoo stopped her itching habit altogether!  A really great product!</li>
    <li> Degrease shampoo works very well for my daughter. It smells good and for a natural shampoo lathers very well so you don&#x27;t need that much. The size could be bigger for $18 for 8oz though. Otherwise a very good oil control shampoo and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, but I rely on them when purchasing products, so I decided to give this a go. I have been using Maple Holistics Degrease shampoo for a month now. I had been continuously searching for a shampoo that worked for my hair type which is long, fine, oily/greasy, and is falling out quite a bit lately. Other things that were important to me in a shampoo were the ingredients - no sulfates, parabens, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit about me - I have oily, acne-prone skin, so it is not surprising that my scalp would have similar issues. Recently I was diagnosed with iron-deficient anemia, which is what has contributed to my hair loss. Otherwise, I have no hormonal imbalances or otherwise that would cause oily, shedding hair (just genetics, I happen to be Italian-American).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While dealing with my horrible hair, I had tried many different techniques including the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; method, just using baking soda and ACV to rinse my hair. Not a good idea. I also tried Wen, and again, this made me practically go bald! After doing some research about this, I learned a lot about hair and scalp and I just wanted to share that here, in hopes that it may save someone else the frustrations that I went through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally I had been washing my hair every-other day, or even every 2 days, as recommended and encouraged by systems like Wen or &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34;. But now I know that it is important, especially for those of us who have oily or dandruff-prone hair, to wash every single day. The buildup of oils on the scalp can block the follicle and cause the hair to fall out. Once I started washing my hair daily, it stopped shedding in massive amounts. What a relief! I use the Degrease shampoo as directed - a quarter-sized amount worked into the scalp and left to sit for a few minutes, then rinse. It produces a rich lather and rinses clean easily. It does feel a bit drying, so I follow with the Maple Holistics Silk 18 conditioner on the ends of my hair, andit is the most pleasant-smelling hair product I have ever used. After showering and blowdrying, I am left with soft, silky, healthy-feeling hair that smells really good. Oh, and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or oily at all. Living up to its name!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moral of the story is: when in doubt, wash your hair every day, especially if it&#x27;s oily. Washing 1x per day will not cause it to be more oily or dry. Your scalp is still skin, after all, and you need to care for it in order to have healthy hair, by washing to remove the oil (sebum) and environmental toxins it is exposed to daily. This shampoo is great for people with oily, fine hair, and the ingredients are natural and safe. I will definitely be sticking with this shampoo from now on.</li>
    <li> Really glad I purchased this! It&#x27;s a little pricey, and doesn&#x27;t smell all that great, but this has done wonders for my hair! Would be five stars if the price was better suited for people on a tight budget. Worth it, though.</li>
    <li> I have long hair. The product is good if used with conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to find an all natural shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy for a VERY long time.  I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every brand you can think of, in every price range.  I&#x27;ve tried the &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; method also.  Although many seemed to work at first, by the end of the day &amp; definitely by the next, my hair was a thick greasy gob of a mess.  My scalp was often itchy.  I have somewhere between curly &amp; wavy medium texture long hair, with a tendency to frizz . I am in love with this shampoo.  My scalp felt so relieved.  I never even realized how much it bothered me until it actually felt good!  I can go a couple days without washing my hair.  I can even jump in the shower for a &amp;#34;wake me up&amp;#34; in the morning without having to wash my hair.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Was hoping but really no different than Suave Clarifying products. If you have short, fine oily hair that needs washing almost twice a day then keep looking, I will too.</li>
    <li> My hair still gets oily within 12 hrs... And smells not so great</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizing shampoo. It gets my hair clean without drying it out. Furthermore, my hair is now much more manageable and easier to comb/style. Loving it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the first organic/natural/mild shampoo I&#x27;ve found that does not dry out my 50 year old hair and cleans it well, leaving it smooth and shiny. It does the same for the oily hair of my 12 year old. We are both loving this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> For months ive been looking for a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out excessively since I already live in the desert, as well as a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy or oily. My hair always feels greasy &amp; oily as it is. After just one use of this my hair already has felt amazing and just fresh. I can go a couple days with my hair still looking clean. &amp; with such long hair I don&#x27;t have to use very much either. I will be buying again!</li>
    <li> This feels like a very harsh de-greaser for my hair. I only use about once a week because I feel like any more would be way too harsh for my hair. it is very drying the days I do use it and I can&#x27;t say that it keeps my hair from getting any more greasy than it does when I don&#x27;t use it. Since that&#x27;s the whole reason I bought this, based on reviews, I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different shampoos for greasy hair and this one actually does work pretty well. It makes my scalp stay clean for longer and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my already fine hair. It was given to me as a gift over Christmas but based on the online pricing I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d pay $18.00 for a modestly sized bottle. I do appreciate the fact that it is made with all natural products though. A worthy product for greasy hair.</li>
    <li> At first when I tried this shampoo I was not happy with it, I responded to their email that I didn&#x27;t like it and they refunded my money AND sent me samples of their other products.  Great company!&lt;br /&gt;I tried the shampoo again and left it on longer both applications and it works better than any other shampoo I have tried for my greasy hair and itchy head...Thank you Maple Holistics!</li>
    <li> this worked for my oily hair. i never had itchy scalp but it was a bit greasy before this. i tried a different shampoo on amazon for oily hair (one that didn&#x27;t have any organic ingredients) and i didn&#x27;t really see an effect. thanks, will be ordering again in the future</li>
    <li> I have had oily hair all my life. I&#x27;ve been using this product along with the silk 18 conditioner for a couple weeks now and I am beginning to see a difference in my hair. I love the refreshing smell and the softness of my hair.</li>
    <li> Just received my shampoo and used it for the first time! Love it! The smell is great and it leaves a feeling of clean hair! I can already feel my hair less oily! If it keeps so good, will be my shampoo for ever!</li>
    <li> I tried the Wen cleansing conditioner, but my hair is fine and on the oily side. No matter what I did, my hair would be greasy by the end of the day. I did like the way the conditioner made my hair virtually tangle free so I didn&#x27;t want to stop using it. That&#x27;s where this shampoo came into the picture. I tried this shampoo to cut through the oil and I love it. I love how there aren&#x27;t any harsh chemicals in it and it made a nice addition to my hair regime. I love it and will be buying another bottle!</li>
    <li> I have really oily hair, and it gets unmanageable after a day or two. I used to use Head &amp; Shoulders dandruff shampoo, only thing that would work. But I have to wash my hair every 2 days otherwise its all oily again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this product, I wash my hair every 3-4 days, and hair has a fresh non-oily feeling after washing with this. I actually recommended this to one of my colleagues also!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took one star off, because it has a weird smell (after you shampoo it). However, that smell doesn&#x27;t make your hair smelly. It only smells that way when you shampoo it.</li>
    <li> I love it!!! for once I can have oil free hair the second day after washing it!!! I am very pleased and will continue to buy this product!!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo has not helped me one bit with my oily, itchy hair.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference in my hair after the first use. I have used this product a few times now and it&#x27;s the best shampoo I&#x27;ve tried in many years. It&#x27;s so nice to finally find a shampoo that works for my naturally oily hair, as all the store bought shampoos I have tried has never really helped. When I rinse my hair off now, it feels different, like it has actually fully cleansed my scalp and taken off the excess oil. I love this stuff and will be using it from now on!</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with greasy hair since I gave birth, possibly due to hormones. I actually tried this from a friend and the first time I washed it, when my hair dried it wasn&#x27;t oily! I had to buy it myself to keep it going!!!!</li>
    <li> This product leaves my hair soft and I am able to comb easily through my hair. My hair is shiny but I wish it were a bit more fluffy. This product smells good and the ingredients are of high quality. I enjoy this product.</li>
    <li> Hair:&lt;br /&gt;I got this bottle about 2 weeks ago &amp; could tell a sincere difference after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;This works amazing!  I washed my hair twice the first time I used it because I wasn&#x27;t sure if I penetrated my entire scalp &amp; wanted to make 100% certain.  It keeps my hair from feeling greasy &amp; stuck to my head when I wake up in the morning.  I can actually wash my hair every other night &amp; not feel grossed out by morning! ;)  I still catch myself washing it a second time occasionally since it doesn&#x27;t feel I&#x27;ve covered every square inch thoroughly.  I believe it is helping to reduce the oil production in my scalp, too, as it claims!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy camper am I!?!  Thank you!!!  Here to order my second bottle since my husband also has oily scalp (even more so) &amp; I&#x27;ve showed him my new found beauty secret.  Only bummer is the pocket slam $$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face:&lt;br /&gt;How could I almost forget....  I am still healing &amp; recovering from one of the absolute worst acne breakouts since pregnancy hormones...  And I&#x27;m only a combination skin kinda gal.  Not solely an oiler.  Lol.  I&#x27;m talking a three-header on one cyst &amp; a double cyst mini clone on another acne breakout.  Which somehow metastasized into 4 huge knots all together; so what, that&#x27;s like 7 total!!  Literally.  And not counting the other 2 on the other side of my chin.  :(  The eruption on my chin was shaped perfectly like an obtuse triangle if you need further laugh factor.  Horrific for me.  Anyway, you may now begin to understand the scale of it...  Thankfully, I was desperate enough &amp; rationalized that since this product was for sebaceous gland &#x27;chilling&#x27;, it couldn&#x27;t hurt to use it since I had tried everything else imaginable to tame it.  Well guess what finally reversed the flare up?!?!  Yup.  I washed my face a few times a day with this shampoo &amp; was delightfully amazed it simmered the beast on my face.  It was a horrible, painful, embarrassing mess but with the help of this savior shampoo...  I lived to share my story &amp; hopefully save someone else from the dreaded acne cysts.  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heck, maybe I&#x27;ll order three right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Attention Producers:**&lt;br /&gt;1) THANK YOU for your product!!  2) Please DOUBLE OR TRIPLE THE QUANTITY since I aim to buy stock in a few minutes here &amp; again infinitely, haha!  But seriously...  :)</li>
    <li> I have been so frustrated with my oily hair since I had my last baby. Nothing has worked. I would shower in the morning and by the evening my hair would be very oily. I decided to give this a try and I&#x27;m hooked! It has really improved the oiliness of my hair. It is definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a shampoo that helps me for my itchy scalp and oily hair. Finally I found it. I have been using head and shoulders (which I really like), but I feel the itching got worse with time and does not help me anymore. I used this shampoo only once so far and there is no itching right after the shower. I am so happy. I hope it will also help me with my oily hair. 5 Stars</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had the itchy hair that I hate so much. It&#x27;s so itchy that I lose focus and just scratch it anywhere so I look like I have lice or dandruff which is so embarrassing. I bought this so that there would be no shame because there is no more itch and scratch.</li>
    <li> Amazing results! I have very long, very thick, oily, wavy hair. I am always on the lookout for gentle, organic or natural, shampoo, that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and that gives it shine and life. I used this one and was immediately aware of how soft my very long hair!  After reading the ingredients I decided to pass on the conditioner I had in the bathroom and just used a natural detangler I have. The results are amazing! My hair is softer than it was when I used conditioner. My hair is soft, light, and fluffy yet thick and healthy looking like it use to be not dry and brittle like some of the tea tree shampoos I had tried left it. Would like to find Degrease in a larger size bottle though.</li>
    <li> this shampoo should be available in the big name stores as this is really effective and much better than others i have tried.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to my granddaughter. It&#x27;s still with me. As soon as I find out from her I will share the information here. Testimonials from other users are convincing and ingredients are wholesome that&#x27;s why a 5 stars rating.</li>
    <li> Very nice shampoo, I bought if for myself but also I use it on my daughters fine long hair and it makes her hair look fuller and cleans all the hair spray residue (from ballet bun) right out after just one wash. This shampoo leathers very nice despite being sulfate free. I have very fine hair but I also use this shampoo once a week to deep cleanse my scalp. It is a little drying on the ends so a masque is needed if I use in on full length of my hair, but I prefer to use this for a scalp wash only.It makes my scalp feel clean and gives the hair a nice lift at the root.</li>
    <li> I have a very oily forehead I find myself almost always having to put my hair in a ponytail around 2-3pm to make it through the workday since my hair soaks up the oil. This shampoo has allowed me to make it through an entire workday AND to after work activities without putting my hair up! I feel like I use a little more conditioner on my ends, but a tradeoff that I will gladly accept!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like the bottle to be a little larger. This bottle will last me 7-8 weeks.</li>
    <li> I have only recently purchased this product and another from the same company, so I really can&#x27;t say how well the products are taking care of my problem, but I wanted to say that the plastic shrink wrap around the lid is very, very brittle and difficult to remove. While trying to lift an edge so that I could cut it away, the brittle plastic cut my finger. I hope that the company will begin using a softer plastic to shrink wrap around the lid!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon after I wrote my first review of this product cautioning buyers about the brittle shrink wrap, I received an email from the company apologizing, offering to send me a new bottle, and assuring me that they had already stopped using the brittle wrap. I greatly appreciate their quick response and am waiting for the replacement product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July, 2013: I ordered another bottle of this product which seems to help with the &#x27;greasiness&#x27;, and the brittle shrink wrap had been removed, so I had no problem opening the bottle. I was a little sad, though, that the offer of a free bottle after my initial comment has not yet been fulfilled.</li>
    <li> My hair gets pretty oily, pretty quick and this shampoo helps a lot with that! I recommend it!!!! The smell is also really nice. :)</li>
    <li> My hair is so oil and sometimes itchy, and I need to wash it every other day. I also loss much hair every day. After using this product several times, though I still need to wash hair every other day, I feel obivously less hair loss now. I do not feel very good efficacy on controlling oil, so I give four stars. Anyway, this is quite a good shampoo.</li>
    <li> very good shampoo for oil, grease, and itch. as it says</li>
    <li> Taking this with us to the beach. Swimming always leaves my hair so annoying on my head and I always think about shaving it off. after a good swim at the pool or at the beach. This thing alleviates all that.</li>
    <li> This is regular shampo nothing extraordinary about it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to go more than two days without shampooing my hair since my roots get greasy and my hair just starts looking gross. I decided to try this shampoo out and I was not disappointed! I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in how much longer my hair looks and feels clean after each shampoo, now I can shampoo once every 2-3 days and my hair doesn&#x27;t have that greasy look to it. I&#x27;m so happy I found this product and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this. The first time, the shampoo wa,s great, I washed every couple days and after a few weeks my hair was much less greasy/oily.  So, I confidently bought another bottle when the first ran out, not realizing it had been reformulated....not the same at all. Now, at best it does nothing, at worst it makes my hair greasier. So disappointing.</li>
    <li> Works very well my hair was thick heavy and saturated feeling I could not remove the greasiness even e blow drying right after using this my hair was normal agian only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell</li>
    <li> This shampoo is something I buy for my colored hair which was faded by another shampoo. This is perfect for keeping my hair color safe.</li>
    <li> My daughter has thick wavy hair with oily/flaky scalp.  We have tried countless shampoos with only minimal results for flaking/itching...until I read the reviews and tried this!  She loves it!!  this is the ONLY product we have tried that got rid both.  Very noticeable difference.  Accidentally ran out and within one week, flaking was back.  Will not run out again!!  Update 2/28/17:  This continues to be our go to shampoo to remove oil and also control flaking with excess sebum.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo but it doesn&#x27;t keep my hair from getting greasy like I thought it would. But it does do a better job then any other shampoo I have tried. I love the smell, and how good it lathers up. You hardly have to use any! It&#x27;s a great shampoo.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It made my hair look less greasy but didn&#x27;t make it dry.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo and conditioner ever used. I&#x27;ve even been getting compliments on my hair</li>
    <li> This shampoo is so awesome!! I have psoriasis on my scalp and this cleans so well I can get three days out of one wash and that has never happened to me in my life. It is gentle and smells great, I follow it up with their Almond Conditioner. This is my third purchase of this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I gave this 5 stars even though it did not completely help my problems with the scalp. It does just what it says it will do, leaves hair shiny and clean. Don&#x27;t be afraid to us it daily, as it does not dry out scalp. I feel that the price/quantity is a little bit high, but I reordered twice and will continue to use it. Thanks</li>
    <li> I got this today and immediately used it and I can tell there is big difference in my hair. It&#x27;s not as oily as before (usually a Couple of hours after shower my hair gets greasy).&lt;br /&gt;I like the natural smell as well.</li>
    <li> made a world of difference for my daughter&#x27;s scalp and hair!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work any better than any of the other shampoos for oily hair that I have tried, so I am very disappointed. I also was unhappy with the high price, especially for the small size of the bottle.</li>
    <li> The shampoo arrived couple days ago, so this is a short term review for now. With one word this product is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very thin and greasy, it normally gets oily in couple days. I opted for this product because I want to use a natural shampoo after being tired of synthetic products. (just search harmful ingredients in cheap shampoos, such as sulfate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;First, it is 100% NATURAL, sulfate free!, 100% Botanical.&lt;br /&gt;Smell is great. The dominant scent is Rosemary, which gives it a fresh and clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;Experience: I used it as if it is described on the card that comes with it (especially no blowdry immediately after), and it worked wonders.&lt;br /&gt;The feel is fresh and rejuvenating. It thickened my hair and gave it a nice shape. More importantly, even two days after use still my hair is not oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the price, I highly suggest to give it a try.</li>
    <li> After 1 week of using this product I have seen no improvement in my oily hair. I used without conditioners and it left my hair very dry feeling and the oily hair returned the next day. My daughter who also has slightly oily hair has used it with success it has also helped her winter dandruff . I have noticed no itchining scalp since using the product. So my final reccomendation would be for anyone with mildly oily hair, itchy scalp and mild dandruff this may help.</li>
    <li> This shampoo did not help with my itchy scalp. However I liked it because it left my hair a lot softer than other natural shampoos I&#x27;ve tried in the past. I liked the smell as well.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have naturally oily skin, and cannot go a day without shampooing my hair, especially in summer. In the few times that I&#x27;ve used this product so far, I&#x27;ve noticed less oiliness on the roots of my hair. Since it is early spring, it remains to be seen how this product holds up during the hot and humid summer months. I&#x27;m hoping this will be the last shampoo I will ever have to buy!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m really selective when it comes to my hair. i&#x27;m willing to spend a little extra because looking my best is worth the few extra dollars. every time i wash my hair, i use this mostly because it equalizes my hair to make it not too oily, but not too dry... that&#x27;s basically the best i can get out of using a shampoo, and i follow it up with conditioner. this is the least expensive shampoo i&#x27;ve ever used and it works better than the others for my hair.</li>
    <li> UPDATE (5/5/13):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve added a star because the company now makes this product available for bulk purchase through a different distribution channel.&lt;br /&gt;Also, they&#x27;ve since added jojoba and argan oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*********************************&lt;br /&gt;This is probably the only honest review here. None of these reviews were very descriptive - the five star ones were lengthy and questionable, and the one stars give all signs that they were planted by a competing company. Here&#x27;s what this product comes down to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a practicing dermatologist for over twelve years, I&#x27;d say that in my experience, more patients have come to me with scalp problems than any other. I give them a routine checklist, and can usually tell if the problem is externally or internally induced. There are tell-tale signs that someone is not aware of weather-protection or the practice of massaging the fingers deep to get the dirt out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is, \\&quot;oily\\&quot; hair is a very common.and misunderstood affliction. Generally, it&#x27;s either greasy hair/greasy scalp or dry hair/greasy scalp. Over 90% of the common factors are hormonal, genetical, or the #1 cause-scalp negligence. This is the only cause for dry hair/greasy scalp, and many people have been using five-dollar shampoos and conditioners loaded with ineffective ingredients. A dermatologist appointment is much more expensive than buying a good shampoo-it&#x27;s pure negligence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about the product. I made sure to contact the company and inquire about the ingredients. I&#x27;m familiar with natural treatments, and had to make sure this isn&#x27;t a shampoo that outlines the problems but doesn&#x27;t offer the necessary treatment. The formula contains cypress, basil, rosemary and lemon. Lemon is cleansing - that&#x27;s a check - but when it comes to Rosemary, most shampoos use the wrong kind. What makes these oils work is their chemical composition, and depending on location, the constituents vary. They use Rosemary that has the terpene verbenone, which is what improves circulation. I can&#x27;t tell you how many rosemary shampoos make the mistake of using Rosemary rich in cinenole and little verbenone  - which doesn&#x27;t help the scalp, but is supposed to do wonders for your liver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the therapeutic benefits of basil, but I&#x27;m not sure why they include cypress. It may be for some synergistic result. (UPDATE 5/5/13: I&#x27;ve been informed that it helps with broken capillaries) Either way, I decided to distribute this to patients to see if it&#x27;s a shampoo worth giving my recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of twenty three patients, nineteen told me the problem was solved (after reusing with following the instructions. It&#x27;s often overlooked but important). It did nothing for the other four, and three of those four had dry hair and oily scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this shampoo is a four star rating because it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;1) Effective&lt;br /&gt;2) Has a pleasant aroma&lt;br /&gt;3) Over time, works the gears in the scalp to take care of the problem. But I&#x27;m taking off two stars off for these reasons:&lt;br /&gt;4) It&#x27;s not in any stores in my area, so when I recommend it to a patient they have to order it online, an inconvinience for some.&lt;br /&gt;5) Revised - it is now available for bulk purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I recommend this to most clients who have greasy hair/greasy scalp. Sebum secretion is something many shampoos fail to heal, but this one succeeds. A message to the company, though: Give an option for bulk purchases! Buying individually is something most companies offer an alternative to. It only makes sense to save money by buying large quantities.verbenone, which is what improves circulation.

    <li> I finally found a shampoo that works for my suddenly oily hair! I followed directions and gave it a couple weeks, and I had great results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.  I&#x27;m not sure it does much more for the price yet, but I&#x27;m glad I tried it nevertheless.  I&#x27;ll need anotherweek or two before knowing if I will order more.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really feel any difference between this and a dollar store shampoo besides that this one smells kind of nice. However I have to state that this is a homeopathic product and the ingredient list does not show what percent of each chemical is present for each ingredients. If you don&#x27;t know  what homeopathic means, you might want to wiki it. Basically there is a pseudo science theory that state that by mixing and diluting useful chemical with inert molecules, like water, the useful chemical&#x27;s material property will somehow be transferred to the inert molecules without the bad side effect. For example, if you take an aspirin pill, dilute it to 1/1 trillion parts with water, and you take a sip of the water, that is suppose to be just as good as aspirin. (aka cut a single aspirin pill into 1 trillion parts, and take that tiny slice with some water). To the credit of amazon, the description did state this is homeopathic. So buyers beware.....</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even express how great this product is. Normally, i have never ever had any problems with my hair, and i use just regular pantene products, Daily moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. It has always worked great for me. But My hair started getting extremely oily and even waxy while I was pregnant. Nothing would take it out, not my regular shampoo, not a clarifying shampoo, I Googled home treatments and tried them all with no success. Lemon juice, baby powder, baking soda, vinegar the list goes on and on. Dawn dish soap did give me significant results but didn&#x27;t completely clean my hair, and eventually started drying my hair out. I was so desperate. I felt and looked disgusting. Even after having my baby, my hair still stayed waxy. I constantly looked like I hadn&#x27;t showered in WEEKS!!! I was so embarrassed. Like I said, I had never had this problem ever before, and I hadn&#x27;t changed products so there was no obvious cause. Maybe hormones? So I decided to take a chance and buy this shampoo, the results were so amazing that I ACTUALLY CRIED!!! I&#x27;m not kidding.  Cried when I dried my hair and finally felt it back to its normal silky self!! This product saved my hair and my sanity. I was so desperate to get my hair clean and I am so so so so glad that I tried this product. It is WELL worth the money!!! Read the instructions and follow them, this product works exactly as described. It also cures the problem,  just like it says. After the very first use, my hair was completely clean again, though I did still need to keep using it to maintain clean hair. But now my hair is back to normal! I didn&#x27;t even finish that first bottle that I bought, and my hair is healthy again. I am back to using my regular products and I saved this shampoo for if I ever need it again.  I cannot even begin to explain how well this product works. Thank you so much maple holistics!!! This is a miracle product!! I would spend the money again in a heartbeat</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic.</li>
    <li> Awesome shampoo !!! I have post menopausal hair issues , and have been losing my mind trying to find something that will clean my hair without leaving it dry, limp and lifeless. This shampoo is AMAZING !!!! Thank you ! Thank you ! Thank you !</li>
    <li> I buy this product for my granddaughter and she loves it ,helps keep her hair healthy!</li>
    <li> My hair is curly and thicker in texture. It leans more towards \\&quot;normal\\&quot; rather than \\&quot;oily\\&quot; so I was not sure how I would like using this shampoo. The company assured me that the shampoo had been reformulated to accomodate normal hair types as well as oily. OK... that&#x27;s a little hard to understand because it seems to me that if the shampoo is a \\&quot;degreaser\\&quot; then it might be a little harsh on normal hair. And that&#x27;s pretty much what my feelings are after having used it for the past 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo has a very earthy fragrance. What was most evident from the very first use of it was that it is a very low-sudsing shampoo. Having such a low-suds shampoo takes some getting used to because you don&#x27;t get the suds feedback you might be accustomed to. With little to no suds developing as you apply this to your hair and scalp and work it in, you&#x27;re not sure if you are using enough product. It almost seemed like It wasn&#x27;t doing anything. But if you then repeat and wash your hair again, the suds level increases to what I consider a more normal level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the cost of this shampoo, I tried a slightly different shampoo technique. I actually used a small quantity of my normal shampoo to pre-wash my hair and rinsed, then used the suggested \\&quot;quarter-size\\&quot; amount of this shampoo and washed my hair again. Doing it this way provided a much more enjoyable level of suds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed directions and massaged the shampoo into my scalp and hair and let it remain for several minutes before rinsing. My hair literally squeaked as I rinsed the shampoo out which never happens with my normal shampoo. To me that meant that the shampoo had really stripped my hair of all oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, when my hair had dried, it had lost a lot of its normal curl and so seemed flat to me. The fragrance was mild and did not linger for long and was of an earthy scent. I asked my wife to smell my hair and she said it smelled like \\&quot;potatoes.\\&quot; I laughed and wasn&#x27;t sure if that was a good or bad thing. I&#x27;ve never had my hair described as smelling like potatoes before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel this shampoo is definitely more suited to people with hair that is not leaning towards normal, like mine, but more towards oily. It does what it claims to do. But normal hair types may not be totally happy with the degreasing effect and how it leaves your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the proper audience, this is probably a good aid to help with oily hair and scalp conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a complimentary sample of the shampoo so that I could test it out and review it in return for honest feedback.t was a good or bad thing.

    <li> cleans hair well, gets rid of the oil</li>
    <li> So I may have the most greasy hair in the history of hair. I can shower at night and wake up with oily hair. I tried using this and I washed it twice as it says. It smells kind of like lemon medication for your hair. (Smells better than that sounds). My hair isn&#x27;t really that much less greasy though. I can go maybe a little bit longer, like a day, without washing my hair but not a whole lot. HOWEVER, using this with the combination of dry shampoo made it possible for me to go 2-3 days without washing my hair. It really depends on your hair and how it reacts. It&#x27;s DEFINITELY worth a try though.</li>
    <li> this shampoo is incredible after the first time of using it my hair was silky smooth it must be the jojoba that had this effect on me i love this shampoo who ever invented this shampoo has to be a king. I say that because this shampoo was designed for kings but the price wasn&#x27;t. thanx so much!!!!</li>
    <li> Product was ok, bottlen seemed like it came halfway full Though, would&#x27;ve expect a full bottle.</li>
    <li> It really cleans your hair, but it didn&#x27;t improve my oily hair condition. Lasted one day, then my hair gets greasy again.</li>
    <li> i like this product...&lt;br /&gt;seems working good on my oily and itchy hair...&lt;br /&gt;bye</li>
    <li> I struggled with dermatitis and dandruff for several years, and prescription shampoos were just too harsh or caused drying of my scalp that only led to more itching. This shampoo is great, it gives you the clean scalp feeling that a harsh chemical shampoo might give but doesn&#x27;t sap the moisture out either. As a person with a very greasy scalp, this is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that over time actually helps control the oil production. I&#x27;m hooked. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, I have oily hair and Have used shampoo after shampoo and all it does is dry out my hair and leave my scalp itchy, this shampoo is the best and I have finally met my match for shampoo.s</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo.  Cleans my scalp good and rest of my hair feels nice and soft not dry. Love that it doesn&#x27;t have the chemicals in it that isn&#x27;t good for my hair.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to effect the color on my hair either.  Kinda expensive tho.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it.  She feels like it makes her hair less greasy. It also help with dandruff.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, an organic shampoo with rosemary and Basil? But when I tried it, right away I knew there was something different about this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;It smelt great and you could really feel a difference when applying. Stick with organic.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The purpose I purchased this product was to manage my oily hair.  After receiving it I realized that it also had an itchy scalp.  I never really thought about my scalp as being itchy but I realized that I spend a bit of time scratching.  I was looking for a product specifically for oily hair and there aren&#x27;t very many options out there.  My first impressions were that of love.  I absolutely loved this shampoo it was like treating myself.  This shampoo is luxurious.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a little under a month and it hasn&#x27;t done a whole lot for my itchy scalp but I definitely feel like my hair is a lot healthier and happier with this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could provide something more substantial but I enjoy using this shampoo.  The shampoo is thick and only requires about a quarter sized amount in your palm.  This allows the shampoo to go a long way in comparison to other shampoos that I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to a friend.  I would recommend to anyone looking to experience silky hair.</li>
    <li> I got a refund, good customer service but the product didn&#x27;t work for me, it&#x27;s too drying for my fine hair, I had more shedding and didn&#x27;t reduce the oil on my scalp, it just dried my hair.</li>
    <li> I have very oily hair that I can&#x27;t wash every day otherwise it dries out my scalp. I use this shampoo once a week and it does the trick. I&#x27;ve noticed my scalp is less oilier over time. A little pricey but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who has an extremely greasy scalp and has been looking for some remedy for years.  Initially, he wasn’t very impressed after the first couple of uses but after using this shampoo for almost a month now, it has been working wonders for him. The results have been amazing so far but I guess you need to give it some time and be patient before you see some results. He was particularly very fond of the fresh herbal scent, which is such a relief because he’s very fussy about natural treatments that have a nasty smell. It’s the only brand he will use from now on. He was very happy with the results and we’ll definitely be making more purchases.</li>
    <li> I used almost 10 different kinds of shampoo for this month, maybe due to the season changing , my hair just become so oily. I tried L&#x27;oreal ever strong, ever sleek, Aveen pepermint and Rosemary, Bumble and bumble ( do not buy this, expensive and it gonna destroy your scalp) etc. Non of them working, but this one is the right shampoo, not to dry but just leave your hair very fresh and soft, and won&#x27;t upset your scalp.</li>
    <li> I am a female with long hair and tried to use a less expensive product, but noticed that my scalp was significantly oilier when I stopped using this shampoo. It allowed me to go two days without washing my hair and without having an itchy and oily scalp.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my  daughter who has inherited my greasy skin and scalp. She is only 9 but has acne around her hairline on her forehead, nose and chin. She does not like to keep her greasy hair off of her face, so it  flares the acne. I am serious about natural holistic everything and I  have used many different types of shampoos and other body products. I used this on my hair and my daughters hair. It is expensive so I only used it a couple of times myself and save it for my daughter. I love it. It smells nice, very earthy. It lathers well, rinses well and my hair is not dried out or oily after a shampoo. When my daughter used the shampoo, it made her hair shiny and soft. It takes a day for it to be greasy. It used to rarely ever look clean for more than a few hours. And I also noticed it helped with her acne. Especially around the hair line. The acne was smaller and her skin a bit clearer. I love the all natural clean that it gives and I will be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I have found to help with greasy hair. I can see a difference, still wash hair every other day, but it&#x27;s not as oily when I do</li>
    <li> I use this on my daughter. She suffers from an itchy scalp and has very oily hair. This is the only product so far I have used that not only received the itching but actually cleans her hair of oiliness and doesn&#x27;t make it feel overly dryed out. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product! Definitely will continue to buy</li>
    <li> VERY expensive and makes my daughters hair not really clean and fresh, and looks oily still after it&#x27;s dried even after she&#x27;s washed and thoroughly rinsed TWICE.</li>
    <li> Although there are many people saying that it&#x27;s a good shampoo, I would like to say it doesn&#x27;t do its job. It does clean your oily hair. But, the more you use it, the more greasy your head skin will be!!</li>
    <li> This Shampoo works better than the prescription shampoo I received from my doctor for oily hair. I love this stuff! I have tried many other products for oily hair but this one actually works!</li>
    <li> I have used it for about one month.&lt;br /&gt;I have greasy hair and this product worked for me on this issue. I feel my hair really clean after using the shampoo. And I like the smell of it, herbal and soothing. But I do need to use conditioner to make my hair smooth. And the product did not increase the volume of my hair and did not work for the dandruff. Probably it needs longer time to see the effect.</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this shampoo for my 11 year old granddaughter.  Her mom said she needed a good shampoo for oily hair.  I looked at various brands available on Amazon and decided on Maple Holistics.  My granddaughter LOVES the shampoo .  My daughter says it does a great job along with the nifty hair scrubber brush I sent. Now my 9 year old granddaughter wants to use it too.  So every generation is pleased!</li>
    <li> I struggle with oily hair to a point were I can wash my hair in the morning and by early afternoon it looks like I haven&#x27;t washed in a week.  This product was amazing!! It has completely eliminated this issue.  I was not sure I wanted to spend so much on shampoo, but it is WELL worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a repeat customer and plan to continue to with this product. :-)</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive scalp issue, for the last year or so I have been experiencing dramatic hair loss and a scalp that gets oily about 4 hours after shampooing. I can&#x27;t seem to figure out what the problem is and have spent hundreds on high end products (nioxin, Aveda invati, legitime) which didn&#x27;t stop the sebum or the hair loss. I even went natural (Jason shampoo). I can across this brand on amazon and thought to myself I have nothing to lose. I have been using this product for 2 weeks and I must say, the first day I saw a lot of hair in my drain so naturally I freaked, then realized the scalp might be adjusting to a brand new item so I calmed a bit. This shampoo cleans the scalp and my hair feels softer than ever which I love. But my problem is my scalp is still shiny after shampooing and touching my scalp 4 hours after shower, my fingers came away with sebum. Eek! I was hoping this would control my sebum for good. By the way I wash my hair every other day and rinse twice each time I do. Anyway I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s too early to tell but I do love how soft and healthy my hair looks. Don&#x27;t love the sebum and hair continuing to fall although I understand this shampoo isn&#x27;t for hair loss. I will update this review in a month</li>
    <li> OUr son has been using this for a little over a year, it&#x27;s wonderful.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product is remarkable!  Purchased for my teenage daughter who battles an itchy scalp and oily appearance near her roots/scalp.  After only a few washes her hair looks remarkable!  No itchy scalp and soft, shiny clean looking hair.</li>
    <li> I bought both shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t particularly impressed w the shampoo(especially for the price that you pay). It smells great(minty) and leaves the hair feeling &amp;#34;squeaky clean.&amp;#34; But I have used other products that were far cheaper and does the job really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the coniditoner(vanilla scent) was great! I have a long hair and , I need only little bit. It smells great-- finally a smell that I can pinpoint to, and my hair feels great afterwards.</li>
    <li> Having always had sensitive skin, I had adjusted as well as anyone to the limited availability in the marketplace for personal care products that address sensitive AND oily  skin. When appealing to the masses,  it seems most companies neglect the needs of this group of individuals.  Having become extremely ill early this year, the resulting impact on my liver seemed to be the culprit behind the devastating skin eruptions, painful swelling knots and scabs, etc all over my head/scalp. Use of both prescription and OTC  products resulted in zero effectiveness. I had to cut my short hair almost to the scalp so I could just deal with the scalp problems. One OTC \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; shampoo was helpful, but the effectiveness only lasted for part of the day. By evening, I had to rewash my scalp to fend off the \\&quot;blemishes\\&quot;.  After seeing a list of \\&quot;10 Shampoos for Oily, Itchy Scalps\\&quot;, I started trying the shampoos on this list... one at a time. After 3 fails, my next attempt was Maple Holistics Degreaser for itchy, greasy scalps.  And miracles of miracles....this shampoo is nothing short of AMAZING! Blemishes,scabs,etc began healing on day one. The infernal itching stopped immediately. Nothing else I tried up to this point stopped the itching AT All.  I can now go all day without a breakout and the gross scabs that just pop up all over my scalp. And how happy I am to get to the end of the day and my scalp is still clean and not already greasy in dire need of rewashing.    How I use this product: to save money, my first lather is with a clarifying shampoo just to cut through the dust and oil of the day. THEN I squeeze a quarter size amount of product in my hand (and yes, that is ALL it takes). This small amount wonderfully creates an emollient that covers my entire scalp. I massage it in (it feels wonderful) and just leave it. The directions suggest 2-3 min. I don&#x27;t time it...just leave it while I complete chores, brush my teeth or whatever. It rinses so quickly and effortlessly, it&#x27;sactually enjoyable now to wash my hair.   For me, Maple Holistics Degreaser is an answer to prayer.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! Prior to this I was only using salon grade products that I got from my stylist. No more. I love the tingling sensation I get from this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times and it cleans my hair but did not help with my itchy scalp, but that may be an underlying allergy that I need to figure out.</li>
    <li> Have only used this for a few days, but so far so good.  I have very fine hair and an itchy scalp and my hair gets greasy really quickly.  I have tried all sorts of shampoos for the itchy scalp, with varying degrees of success, but haven&#x27;t yet found anything that has worked to totally relieve it and definitely haven&#x27;t found any that help with how greasy my hair is.  Was excited to find this shampoo that suggested it could do both.  I noticed a difference in grease after the first few uses.  It definitely added volume to my generally limp hair.</li>
    <li> I’ve been using the Maple Holistics degrease shampoo on a daily basis for 3 weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed how my scalp is less bright/reflective. I’ve also noticed how the itchiness has decreased considerably. I use to find myself scratching my head unconscionably. Not anymore.&lt;br /&gt;One of the best features in comparison with other anti-dandruff shampoos is that it has a very nice lemon-citrus-like smell.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would consider this product as a good one. I don’t know if it’s going to happen, but I expect this product to give even better results after a month, specially with the greasiness of my scalp</li>
    <li> Weird, unexpected things happen to you when you&#x27;re pregnant.  Things they didn&#x27;t warn you about.  Like your hair suddenly becoming a disgusting greasy mess.  I went from washing it every 2-3 days (which is not that gross IRL) to washing every day to deal with the new nasty. We all know that washing every day can be very counter productive and sometimes my old shampoos didn&#x27;t even help.  When I found this stuff, I was hopeful but prepared to be disappointed.  Lo and behold, this stuff worked immediately and it smells pretty good too. I have curly hair which can be very picky about the shampoos that I use so the fact that I my hair looks decent with it makes me extra happy. I&#x27;ll probably even still get it after the baby comes.  Good job, Maple Holistics.</li>
    <li> I have an oily hair. So far, I tried many kinds of shampoo. However, none of them had satisfactory result. I just got this product today and tried right away. It worked great and feel much comfortable with my hair! I am going to buy more for my friends as a gift.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several weeks now and so far it has worked quite well. While it did not prevent my hair from getting greasy by the end of the day - which, I actually was not even expecting from the start since that would be rather unrealistic, at least for my hair anyway, so I was not really disappointed in that respect - I definitely noticed that it did not get greasy as quickly as it used to. I have also been using conditioner along with it (just on the bottom half of my hair) after reading other reviews about how drying it could get and thankfully I have not experienced that problem yet. Not my favorite scent ever and it is a bit too pricey but I think it works and would recommend it to others!</li>
    <li> I do like the way this washes your hair I do have to use conditioner with it as my hair is extremely dry the smells are wonderful and it does not break out your skin makes sense to be very sensitive I would definitely buy this again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had to wash my hair everyday to keep that greasy look away.  A friend of mine purchased this for me and I love it.  I can actually go 2 days between shampoos now.  The cost is a little more than I normally pay for shampoo but taking in account I don&#x27;t have to use it everyday makes it as cost effective as the other shampoos.</li>
    <li> I love it.  It takes care of my greasy hair  and the itch that some time comes with  the excess oils leaves hair soft</li>
    <li> I loved this product. It smells great, and it&#x27;s sulfate free! &#x3D;) I will definitely try others in this line.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re product that I recently purchased is great for my hair. I have really coarse hair that is SUPER oily at the scalp, dry at the ends and colored black from my natural dark blonde. Every shampoo (even salon brand name ones) contained Sulfate which stripped the color out of my hair very fast. I was using another brand (pantene) and Joico deep conditioner with argan oil just at the bottom. With this, I don&#x27;t have to do that anymore. It&#x27;s even helped ease the symptoms of the psoriasis in my scalp. Great product. Only one downfall. IMO, it&#x27;s a little too gel-y for my taste so i&#x27;m giving it four stars.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works great for my scalp; helps with the itchiness &amp; leaves hair feeling silky soft. I&#x27;d give it a full five stars, but I&#x27;m not entirely crazy about the scent.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when buying this shampoo because I&#x27;ve tried just about everything for my oily scalp... I have the oily scalp/dry ends combo that is horrific to deal with. This treated my oily scalp problem and I still use a conditioner to help with my dry ends. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, but wish that they would come out with a combo shampoo to help with the oily scalp/dry ends problem.</li>
    <li> this product is amazing! Normally I use Head and Shoulders for itchiness but this goes above and beyond that. Smells great and works magic!</li>
    <li> Been using this for several days now and it seems like it does the job. My hair gets very oily fast and I constantly have pimples or zits on my scalp and hairline which are always annoying me, but so far it seems they are going away. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the shampoo or if they&#x27;re just going away naturally, it&#x27;s too early to tell. Time will tell eventually. The fragrance is very nice and it&#x27;s something I would never get sick of.  As most other people I never really thought to massage the scalp with my shampoos (which the instructions say to do that came with the product) and just mostly brushed them through my hair with my fingers. Make sure you read the card that comes with it!  I will be most likely a returning customer in the future, assuming my hair doesn&#x27;t spontaneously combust out of nowhere.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product ! My daughter who is 14,has very oily hair and itchy scalp...Before we discovered this shampoo ,we tried a lots of other means of trying to improve the condition of my daughter hair...Now I think we found what we were looking for a long time.Hair condition has improved and itching gone.</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  I was worried that it would dry out the ends of my hair, but it didn&#x27;t.  My hair felt wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried the Maple Holistics Shampoo for Oily, itchy &amp; Greasy Hair &amp; I absolutely love it!  My hair stays so oily &amp; I have to wash it everyday.  Since I have been using this shampoo, my hair has felt &amp; looked so much better!  I recommend this to everyone who has Oily hair :)</li>
    <li> Helped my dry itchy scalp that I get in the winter, and my hair doesn&#x27;t get greasy so quickly. I love the way it smells. Unfortunately it is very expensive.</li>
    <li> So Far so good. I&#x27;ve only been using this shampoo for about a week, but my hair is definitely less oily/greasy now.  The shampoo smells great and lathers up nicely.  There isn&#x27;t much else to say besides that it simply does it is says and it has natural and safe ingredients.</li>
    <li> Disappointed. Not as description states:&lt;br /&gt;Product Details&lt;br /&gt;Product Dimensions: 1.8 x 1.8 x 6.8 inches ; 9.9 ounces&lt;br /&gt;Shipping Weight: 10.4 ounces (View shipping rates and policies)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the package and it&#x27;s not 9.9, it is 8 ounces. I already considered the purchase expensive but really needed something like this for my daughter.  I feel deceived, and the product is being shipped back which is another hassle. Very disappointed! I don&#x27;t know what the actual product is like.</li>
    <li> The best.  I tried many, many shampoos for my aging scalp and mild psoriasis. This ex foliates the scalp, helps loosens dead skin and build up and opens the pores, much like an ex-foliation  for your face.  The first time I lathered up and put on a shower cap for 10 minutes to let it work. Rinsed, conditioned and my hair was full and soft again. Its a keeper</li>
    <li> Why are the ingredients in the description different from the actual ones shown in the photo? There is one notorious one that is missing from the list in the description, and people interested in staying away from toxic chemicals would like to know. The missing ingredient not mentioned? DMDM HYDANTOIN (FORMALDEHYDE RELEASER). About DMDM HYDANTOIN (FORMALDEHYDE RELEASER): DMDM hydantoin is an antimicrobial formaldehyde releaser preservative. People exposed to such formaldehyde-releasing ingredients may develop a formaldehyde allergy or an allergy to the ingredient itself and its decomposition products. There is concern for allergies and cancer on this ingredient. Why the hype for a shampoo that seems to be ALL natural? Can people be deceived this easily?</li>
    <li> I have oily hair and for the last 3-4 years I was using Lush Jumping Juniper shampoo. Any other commercial shampoos would leave my hair greasy on the first day after washing.  This shampoo has both pros and cons :&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- It does work well. I used it two time and the day two is still the day when my hair is not greasy and I can put it down. Day three -not so much, I have to still use dry shampoo&lt;br /&gt;- If foams well&lt;br /&gt;- It is natural&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves hair feeling &#x27;clean&#x27; - you know, that squeaky clean feeling you can experience when hair is still wet&lt;br /&gt;- It is not over drying as some harsh shampoos for oily hair can be&lt;br /&gt;- Adds volume (I have thin long hair)&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It has somewhat medicinal smell, but it does not linger for long&lt;br /&gt;- It is somewhat pricey, and it works for me as well as Lush which is half price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review a bit later once my hair had more time to adjust to this new shampoo</li>
    <li> Just received this product two weeks ago. It has made a huge difference in my oily hair. My scalp  is less oily by the end of the day and I have been able to wash my long hair every other day.  It comes in a small bottle but luckily you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is really good for greasy hair. This is the second time I order it. like  it</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  I have been using this product for about a week.  My main issue is that my hair is very fine and therefore easily shows any bit of oil, especially in my brow line.  I have seen a noticeable difference in just this short time.  Despite it&#x27;s cost and small bottle, I don&#x27;t need very much to get a decent lather and have found that I can get away with skipping a wash here and there, as the grease build-up is decreasing.  I am therefore not using as much of the product weekly. I also enjoy the scent and my hair does not seem dry since I am only using conditioner on my ends. I plan to continue using it and hope it may be the solution to my greasy bangs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received my order and am starting my 2nd bottle. The reason I did&lt;br /&gt;re-order it, is that it is the only shampoo I have tried to date, that not&lt;br /&gt;only tames my oily scalp, but keeps the itchiness gone all day. Every other&lt;br /&gt;shampoo I have used - medicated or not, prescription or over-the-counter,&lt;br /&gt;has failed to tame my oily, itchy scalp.  Thank you for a great, reasonably&lt;br /&gt;priced product, which lives up to its label.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb!!!  My whole life I had to shampoo one to two times a day.  Now I can go a couple days without shampooing.  Amazing.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo, leaves my hair so clean and soft</li>
    <li> Oily hair is something that is harder to solve than dandruff - many shampoos I&#x27;ve tried from Top Name brands smelled nice but overall didn&#x27;t help me. When I&#x27;d rub my hands through my hair, it felt a little sticky - manageable, but uncomfortable. A friend recommended this company and I&#x27;ve personally been using this shampoo for over a month. I followed the directions, and reaped the benefits. I&#x27;m attracted to products that take advantage of mother nature&#x27;s beauty solutions, which have helped us for years before the chemical alternatives were introduced.&lt;br /&gt;Stick with the winners, they tell me. This shampoo is a winner. Five stars for scent, quality, texture, ingredients - and most importantly - effectiveness.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell, but it seems to do the job.  I was using it regularly and my hair and scalp seem to be more under control now.</li>
    <li> So..... I never have posted a review ever on anything. This product is amazing. I purchased it around a week ago and all the issues I have had with my scalp are gone. AMAZING. I had excess sebum buildup that would cause small zits in my hairline. Sometimes these zits would get out of hand and become more like a cyst that would eventually need to be lacerated. I thought I had tried everything and just kind of accepted it. Thank you so much for this product.</li>
    <li> I have blond, oily hair and wash it every morning. By the end of the day I can slick down my bangs due to the oil.  This is the first product that I have found to actually work on decreasing the oil. I have used all different kinds of shampoos, home remedies and even changed my diet. Last summer I stopped using all additional product in my hair but the oiliness never changed. Now, my hair is no longer a different color by the end of the day. I still have to wash it every morning but that is okay.&lt;br /&gt;One other thing I have noticed is that the oil on my forehead is so much better. By the afternoon I am usually wiping the oil off and always adding powder to absorb the excess. Since using this shampoo, I haven&#x27;t had a shiny/greasy forehead and that is another huge plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;I do wish the bottle was bigger but I have spent more on salon brands that didn&#x27;t help my hair situation.  I am very pleased with this shampoo and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a really nice herbal scent to it and feels good when lathered.  I don&#x27;t know how well it works in terms of degreasing my scalp tho.  It feels nice the day after shampooing but after then my hair does get greasy again.  This goes for any shampoo however.  I have been using this every few days for about 1-2 weeks now and will continue to use this shampoo.</li>
    <li> i am so bummed that this shampoo didn&#x27;t work.  it is expensive and it is a small bottle which may only last a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;you have to shampoo twice in order for it to &amp;#34;work&amp;#34;.  yet it hasn&#x27;t made a difference.  i don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> No stars for me! My head itches more and I have more dandruff than before. Horrible!</li>
    <li> Since a couple of months after my second child was born, I&#x27;ve been having a terrible problem with oily scalp/forehead.  I have thin, fine hair and I typically go two days between shampoos.  I tried a couple of shampoos for oily hair; at best they made my hair okay for the first day, but it would be so greasy by the next day.  I was using so much dry shampoo/hair powder to get through that 2nd day.  Not only that, but my scalp ITCHED.  So, when I first read about this shampoo it sounded like exactly what I needed.  However, I know that my issue right now is hormonal from my pregnancy, so I was skeptical that any external solution would help with an internal problem.  Also, the reviews for this shampoo were sketchy.  Most of them sound like they&#x27;re probably people who work for the company (honestly, who talks about how good a label looks in a review??).&lt;br /&gt;After using this shampoo for almost two weeks now (every other day), I am very impressed.  The itching decreased dramatically after the first use, and is basically gone now.  I did notice that my hair didn&#x27;t seem quite as oily on the second day after a couple of shampoos, but today was the first day that I didn&#x27;t have to use anything in my hair on the 2nd day!  It didn&#x27;t look or feel much different than yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;I would give this five stars for effectiveness, but it does dry my hair out a bit.  If you have fine hair like mine, invest in a quality conditioner (use only on the ends), and find a hair oil (argan or pequi works best for me) you like to put on your ends once they&#x27;re dry.</li>
    <li> I have been trying for years to find a shampoo like this. So many expensive big name brands did not deliver like this shampoo does. I have really oily hair and even when I washed it every day, by night it looked gross again. I ordered this shampoo along with the Silk 18 condition and it is AMAZING! I was so surprised that my hair was soft, silky, and clean and I did not have to wash my hair every day. It felt like I had just walked out of a salon. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. I will be buying again!!!</li>
    <li> I always have greasy hair problem till now ,I have tried lot of product but this has been the best one for me .</li>
    <li> Not a good shampoo for my husband&#x27;s greasy hair.</li>
    <li> Great product for oily hair.</li>
