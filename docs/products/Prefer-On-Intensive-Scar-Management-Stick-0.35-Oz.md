      <li>I love this product and wish I could find it in stores!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s amazing</li>
      <li>the silicone items are better but for a stick item really good because while healing you cannot use the silicone ones.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I really liked this product and i recommend it.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with the results and it even faded some of my really old childhood marks.</li>
      <li>Prefer On is the most effective scar minimizing product I have found.  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, thanks to</li>
      <li>I am determined to use this for a while on the old scars since if it was this wonderful on the new scar, I have high hopes it will work on my older scars.</li>
      <li>I have been using Prefer On for the last year, and I love it!  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product since my first full shoulder replacement six years ago.  </li>
      <li>It did a good job at significantly reducing the &amp;#34;swelling&amp;#34; (hypertrophic scar) of one of the scars, the other i can barely see an improvement (maybe because it is raised more than the other).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not even worth the paper its printed on.</li>
      <li>and I love the fact that its so portable (like a chapstick), its not messy to apply nor does it stain your clothes.</li>
      <li>but it is worth it.</li>
      <li>Works wonders I have used this in the past and am so happy I was able to find it on here it has helped me with my stretch marks in numerous places totally worth the money</li>
      <li>you can even put it on older scars to smooth them out a little, though it&#x27;s not as good as when you put it on when the cut is still healing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Over all, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s probably very effective on smaller and less significant scars and only somewhat effective on large scars.</li>
      <li>Well, I&#x27;m pleased to say my scars are fading totally away.</li>
      <li>If you are consistent with this product, it will work wonders.</li>
      <li>and at the time i bought it, i paid a higher price, oh well.</li>
      <li>is running low, not because I needed to apply that much more.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just wax more or less...same thing as putting chap stick mixed in with glycerin.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product for anyone!!</li>
      <li>It does take time &amp; patience, but this product really works!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many scar products, expensive to cheap, and this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>I would really recommend it to anyone with a scar mark even if from years ago.</li>
      <li>helps with tightness of scar - don&#x27;t know if it really dimishes appearance of scar</li>
      <li>The scar is still there and very visible</li>
      <li>This stuff REALLY works if you use it morning and night.  </li>
      <li>this stuff really works providing that you use it every day for a couple of weeks.  </li>
      <li>and i think it worked really well.</li>
      <li>it didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>It is also MUCH easier to use than all of those gels out there that run all over.</li>
      <li>It seems to work on both old and more recently received scars.</li>
      <li>ya live and learn!</li>
      <li>However, for older scars that I have it will take a while to heal - I don&#x27;t see a difference yet in scars that are older than 2 years.</li>
      <li>Also, I think this is how it works, causing the old skin to wilt away to allow for new, pretty skin to come to the surface.    </li>
      <li>It works very well on removing both old and new scars.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very hard to find locally and it works great for him.</li>
      <li>Got this burn last February (2011) from a space heater that was left on near my bed... :) learned my lesson and I feel lucky that it was just a burn and not a burned down house.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply without scent or mess.</li>
      <li>I NOW HAVE A TOTAL OF 5 FULL JOINT REPLACEMENTS AND USE PREFERON DAILY.  </li>
      <li>I actually think this works a little better..</li>
      <li>I tried it with a burn (the size of two quarters) from an iron i was using, and i applied as instructed (3-4 times a day), and it disappeared completely and</li>
      <li>but I found within six months, the scar had disappeared completely.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s no-mess design, it doesn&#x27;t seem to leave a residue on clothes or furniture, and the appearance of my scars really does diminish with regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>I keloid and the scar was from cancer surgery on my left cheek, six inches long, so it was a true blessing.</li>
      <li>and I got it only because the first one (purchased it in the local store)</li>
      <li>Older scars take much longer to even start fading, but they have reduced in odd coloration, if not texture.  </li>
      <li>But within two weeks there was a big difference, I just kept using to see how much it would fade to match my regular skin color.  </li>
      <li>For several years I have struggled with acne as a teenager and young adult.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m applying it to, so it&#x27;d last much longer for someone with only one or two scars.</li>
      <li>I broke both ankles and every bone in my right leg in a car accident a few years ago, so</li>
      <li>Old or new scars, keep applying it won&#x27;t let you down.</li>
      <li>Thus far, I have noticed a strange tingling, almost burning sensation on the area</li>
      <li>My scar is almost invisible and my acne is far less frequent.</li>
      <li>New forming scars start fading within days, and any new forming scars are usually gone within a month.  </li>
      <li>can be hard to find but definitely worth it.</li>

<li> Until I found this, within the span of a few months of using it regularly the scar is now almost invisible.</li>
<li> It does cause the skin to flake and peel (rather badly), but I think this side-effect is worth getting rid of the dark marks on my face from old pimples.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used the product diligently for the last two weeks, usually just morning and night.  </li>
<li> and I used it daily usually after a shower, before bedtime.</li>
<li> Its pretty expensive and goes quickly especially if you have large areas to cover, but seeing my horrible stretch marks become less visible is worth it- Bikini by summer time</li>
<li> It is a little harder to find unless you buy on here.</li>
<li> I have spent hundreds of dollars trying to minimize my acne and acne scars with little to no success.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been using Prefer On for the last year, and I love it!  New forming scars start fading within days, and any new forming scars are usually gone within a month.  Older scars take much longer to even start fading, but they have reduced in odd coloration, if not texture.  Best if used immediately after the wound heals and the discolored skin/new scarring first starts.  It does cause the skin to flake and peel (rather badly), but I think this side-effect is worth getting rid of the dark marks on my face from old pimples.  Also, I think this is how it works, causing the old skin to wilt away to allow for new, pretty skin to come to the surface.    I love this product and wish I could find it in stores!</li>
    <li> My skin peeled and dried up, but I did not see a difference in my scars. Did not get lighter, smaller or smoother.</li>
    <li> Prefer On is the most effective scar minimizing product I have found.  It works very well on removing both old and new scars.</li>
    <li> Excellent low cost product that really worked for me. I had two 5 inch long scars on my knees. I purchased several very expensive scar creams, and saw little improvement. I read several reviews about Preferon. So, I decided to give it a try. Well, I&#x27;m pleased to say my scars are fading totally away. One thing that is very important to remember. Sometimes, it takes months to a year, to see a bad scar go away. Keep using the product everyday.  I have been using this product for about 10 months now.  So time and patience are the key</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week and i&#x27;m happy to say that it is really working for me. I gained 60 lbs during my pregnancy and I have very bad stretch marks on my stomach, and they are already disappearing! Its also making a scar on my knee i&#x27;ve had since I was about 8 fade too. The only negative that I have is that i&#x27;ve already used nearly two sticks of it. Its pretty expensive and goes quickly especially if you have large areas to cover, but seeing my horrible stretch marks become less visible is worth it- Bikini by summer time lol!!!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my physical therapist and have seen improvement and continuous improvement in the appearance of scar.  Easy to apply without scent or mess.</li>
    <li> I got this product to treat keloid scars and I can see and feel the difference when applied.  This is a product that works for me.</li>
    <li> i am prone to Keloids, and when i had a c-section i was afraid i would have a big ugly scar on my lower tummy.  I started putting this on about 3 weeks after the surgery and a scar never formed.  I literally DO NOT have a scar.  It is invisible.  I also put it on stretchmarks to make the redness go away.  you can even put it on older scars to smooth them out a little, though it&#x27;s not as good as when you put it on when the cut is still healing.&lt;br /&gt;It also works for dark marks left behind after a breakout.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m about to buy 3 more sticks.</li>
    <li> My surgeon recommended this for my thyroid scar and as soon as my wound healed and was no longer open I started this product (9 days after surgery). It is wonderful, after just a few days there is already a huge difference. However, for older scars that I have it will take a while to heal - I don&#x27;t see a difference yet in scars that are older than 2 years. I am determined to use this for a while on the old scars since if it was this wonderful on the new scar, I have high hopes it will work on my older scars.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product it works really good I been using it for a long time and it&#x27;s amazing</li>
    <li> For several years I have struggled with acne as a teenager and young adult. I have spent hundreds of dollars trying to minimize my acne and acne scars with little to no success. A few years ago when I was in a snowboarding accident and split my chin open to the bone, I was on a mad hunt to purchase scar removing ointments. I stumbled across PREFER ON and thought I would try it on my chin and acne. I was very happy with the results. My scar is almost invisible and my acne is far less frequent.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Old or new scars, keep applying it won&#x27;t let you down. By the way I need more of it!</li>
    <li> the best I have used and I have used everything. can be hard to find but definitely worth it. its all I use.</li>
    <li> I have used this product on some OLD, OLD scars and it help to reduct the red ridge (now hardly visiable) that I had had for a number or years.  When I had gllblater surgery, I once again turn to Perfferon.  I couldn&#x27;t find it in the drug store so I turned to good ol&#x27; Amazon and their it was.  I received the product in good condition.  I have only used the product two weeks and my scar is already looking lighter.</li>
    <li> Ordered for a friend,it arrived quickly he was thrilled.It&#x27;s very hard to find locally and it works great for him.</li>
    <li> It does take time &amp; patience, but this product really works! Good amount for the price as well. A good choice!</li>
    <li> I have surgical scars on my toes and this did nothing to alleviate them or reduce their appearance.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This stuff REALLY works if you use it morning and night.  It is also MUCH easier to use than all of those gels out there that run all over.</li>
    <li> i used for 3 months. it didn&#x27;t do much. and at the time i bought it, i paid a higher price, oh well. ya live and learn!</li>
    <li> I think I fooled myself of this thing working but it the end, it doesn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s just wax more or less...same thing as putting chap stick mixed in with glycerin.</li>
    <li> Very effective indeed!!!!</li>
    <li> this stuff really works providing that you use it every day for a couple of weeks.  I like the size because I can use it on my eyelids after the surgery has healed.  This product virtually removed a scar from my hand.</li>
    <li> the silicone items are better but for a stick item really good because while healing you cannot use the silicone ones. expensive but worth it especially on shallow cuts</li>
    <li> Love this product. Feels good on body parts that have been scraped, burned etc. Eventually will aid the healing of scars.</li>
    <li> Still good.  Lasts long time.</li>
    <li> I broke both ankles and every bone in my right leg in a car accident a few years ago, so yeah, I have scars. I&#x27;ve tried many scar products, expensive to cheap, and this is my favorite. It&#x27;s easy to use, thanks to it&#x27;s no-mess design, it doesn&#x27;t seem to leave a residue on clothes or furniture, and the appearance of my scars really does diminish with regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to be vigilant with it and use every night and morning to see results! The tube lasts about a month or month and a half for me with regular use, but I do have a lot of scar surface I&#x27;m applying it to, so it&#x27;d last much longer for someone with only one or two scars. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> If you are consistent with this product, it will work wonders. It does take time, a lot of time, before you begin to notice a difference but I found within six months, the scar had disappeared completely. I keloid and the scar was from cancer surgery on my left cheek, six inches long, so it was a true blessing. I couldn&#x27;t recommend it more highly.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time. I used this product religiously and saw no change. Plus, since it&#x27;s so hard to find, these guys will rack up the price -- there used to be a time when you could buy it for about $8.99 at Wal-Mart.</li>
    <li> I have a ver, very nasty scar on my left forearm and being that I&#x27;m diabetic it took it forever to heal. And once the scabs went away I was left with a very nasty deep dark purple scar that would not go away and I had tried every scar reducer on the market and none of them worked. Until I found this, within the span of a few months of using it regularly the scar is now almost invisible. I would highly recommend this product for anyone!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me . Doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for scars. Ill have to try something else. Not even worth the paper its printed on.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from a local store in the hopes of lessening the ungainly sight of an awful burn scar on my lower leg. Got this burn last February (2011) from a space heater that was left on near my bed... :) learned my lesson and I feel lucky that it was just a burn and not a burned down house. Anyway, I&#x27;ve just started using it and will update this again in three weeks with a progress report! Thus far, I have noticed a strange tingling, almost burning sensation on the area I apply it so it seems to be doing something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED 3 Weeks Later:&lt;br /&gt;The Prefer On scar treatment had a small but still noticeable effect on the scar. The scar is still there and very visible but I&#x27;ve definitely noted a moderate decrease in the intensity of its color difference from my surrounding skin. Another change was in the texture; before, my scar was raised and rough even after exfoliating repeatedly in the shower...Prefer On seemed made it completely smooth. Over all, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s probably very effective on smaller and less significant scars and only somewhat effective on large scars. 4/5 stars.</li>
    <li> For the product to work it is important to follow the directions. It could take a while to see results depending on your scares but the product does work.</li>
    <li> A little pricey - yes - but it really REALLY improved the look of (noticeably) and faded the two huge surgery scars I had which were still an angry reddish color and ugly after two years from when I got them.  It does take a little time maybe it was a month &amp; half and I used it daily usually after a shower, before bedtime. But within two weeks there was a big difference, I just kept using to see how much it would fade to match my regular skin color.  I am very happy with the results and it even faded some of my really old childhood marks. Which is why I purchased a stick online, because I don&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore out here in Hawaii. I would really recommend it to anyone with a scar mark even if from years ago. It seems to work on both old and more recently received scars. This is only my second stick (this one purchased online) and I got it only because the first one (purchased it in the local store) is running low, not because I needed to apply that much more.  Also there is no expiration date for the product. (see their website for more details) so ordering one now makes sense - before I forget what it&#x27;s called or what the box looks like.</li>
    <li> This works well it takes the time promoted on the product but it is worth it. It will let scars seem less visible.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since my first full shoulder replacement six years ago.  I NOW HAVE A TOTAL OF 5 FULL JOINT REPLACEMENTS AND USE PREFERON DAILY.  It is not greasy and does not stain my clothing like others I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JWH</li>
    <li> i didnt know this was this pricey, my mom had gotten it for me for some stretch marks i have. I didnt see any noticeable difference regarding the stretch marks, but i did use it in 3 separate occasions and i think it worked really well. I tried it with a burn (the size of two quarters) from an iron i was using, and i applied as instructed (3-4 times a day), and it disappeared completely and that&#x27;s that im really pale. Then i applied it after i had waxed my eyebrows and ripped by accident a piece of skin; the result was no crater and no scarring. Lastly, i just started applying it to a pretty awful 3 year old surgery scar, that did not heal well. It did a good job at significantly reducing the &amp;#34;swelling&amp;#34; (hypertrophic scar) of one of the scars, the other i can barely see an improvement (maybe because it is raised more than the other).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really liked this product and i recommend it. It definitely helps if you apply it as instructed and I love the fact that its so portable (like a chapstick), its not messy to apply nor does it stain your clothes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product diligently for the last two weeks, usually just morning and night.  It seems to be smoothing out a scar from an incision.</li>
    <li> Works wonders I have used this in the past and am so happy I was able to find it on here it has helped me with my stretch marks in numerous places totally worth the money</li>
    <li> helps with tightness of scar - don&#x27;t know if it really dimishes appearance of scar</li>
    <li> Did what it would do (remove scar). Great stuff. Used it and still use it when the situation ask for it.</li>
    <li> I like this and Maderma. I actually think this works a little better.. It is a little harder to find unless you buy on here.</li>
    <li> Order this product regularly and always as expected no problems I have nothing is to said  can not think of anything else</li>
