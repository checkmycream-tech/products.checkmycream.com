      <li>This is one of the best products I have ever used I put it on at night and in the morning my lips look full and plump!</li>
      <li>This is a really good product for the price.</li>
      <li>it does what it says, really good product, my lines desappear.</li>
      <li>but I think for a night treatment it might be a good thing as it will prevent dryness.</li>
      <li>does a fair job.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t even give a good feel when on.</li>
      <li>Wife is very satisfied</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very glad that I found it online.</li>
      <li>LOVE it!</li>
      <li>I love the way this stuff feels on my lips!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay !</li>
      <li>Easy to use and a great price.  </li>
      <li>But as a moisturizer, Sally Hansen&#x27;s peptide is a nice lip treatment.</li>
      <li>KIND OF GREASY THOUGH</li>
      <li>Fair pricing and quick service too!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks now and my fine lines are going away!</li>
      <li>For many years, this product has worked for me to diminish lines around my lips.  </li>
      <li>Love it...buy it again...</li>
      <li>I think I will be buying this affordable alternative for all the ladies in my family for Christmas :)</li>
      <li>Love this peptide.</li>
      <li>I love, love, love this product.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product, have been using this forever, but went to p/u at my store location where I buy this product and was told that it is being discontinued?</li>
      <li>Of course we are all looking for the magic lip treatment to take the wrinkles away</li>
      <li>just ordered 2 more bottles.</li>
      <li>They look much better.</li>
      <li>Received it in a timely manner and once again fell in love with throduct.</li>
      <li>IT&#x27;S OK...</li>
      <li>I have been using it for several years and am very impressed with the results.</li>
      <li>Probably won&#x27;t buy again, but glad I gave it a try.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>A lot of hype for one more product that doesn&#x27;t deliver</li>
      <li>But peptites have become very popular and as a result have really gone up in price.  </li>
      <li>This is pretty good lip moisturizer, but that&#x27;s what is supposed to do.</li>
      <li>I love this product because it helps the fine lines around my mouth.</li>
      <li>This basically maintains healthy smooth lips, and I recommend using it in conjunction with Sally&#x27;s Radiance lipstick..</li>
      <li>However, the important thing is the lotion makes the applied area more &amp;#34;full&amp;#34;  and adds volume.</li>
      <li>Did not absorb easy.</li>
      <li>I never had lines by my lips until I moved to Phoenix from NJ 7 years ago - within one year of being here and exposed to the strong sun - lines</li>
      <li>Keeps your lipliner &amp; lip stick from bleeding into fine lines around the mouth.</li>
      <li>Fine lines are reduced and lips&lt;</li>
      <li>I love this treatment and I was lucky to find it.</li>
      <li>If it is still available.</li>
      <li>I have been using Elizabeth Arden 8 Hour cream for years on lips and have always thought it was fantastic</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re look for a miracle, then get filler or surgery, but if you&#x27;re looking for a more refreshed, less lined look, this is a great product for the price.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find this product for a while and was so excited to find it on this website.</li>
      <li>The reviews for it seemed on the positive side for the most part.</li>
      <li>The only good thing about this item is that it kept my lips moist.</li>
      <li>However, don&#x27;t expect a miracle, like full lips or anything like that.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t impressed so glad it wasn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
      <li>but I do have very sensitive skin compared to most.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Definitely worth a try.</li>
      <li>It really helps with fine lines for the older woman.</li>
      <li>It is an awesome product for aging thin lips!</li>
      <li>It works so much better than similar products sold in dpt store cosmetic Dpts.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of products, some costing much more, and some totally &amp;#34;natural.&amp;#34; Nothing else works as well.  </li>
      <li>At first I thought I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m going to like this</li>
      <li>I wish this came in a large bottle.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Sally Hanson Peptide Lip Treatment really seems to improve the lines that I feel are caused by using a straw for years.</li>
      <li>Really help my lip lines.  </li>
      <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
      <li>made my lips feel much fuller.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>This really works.  </li>
      <li>I see real results with this product.  </li>
      <li>I put it on before bed and immediately could feel my skin absorbing it</li>
      <li>Lipstick won&#x27;t go over it very well</li>
      <li>This product intrigued me because it was so inexpensive, and because it contains peptides, which are the second most popular anti-aging ingredient - right behind retinol.</li>
      <li>Other sally products I do love.</li>
      <li>It feels nice, lasts for awhile, and at least it doesn&#x27;t dry my lips even more, like some glosses &amp; lipsticks do.</li>
      <li>When it disappeared from stores where I live, I was really worried.  </li>
      <li>Nothing makes a girl look older than lines around the lips.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend highly.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend for women with wrinkles around the mouth.</li>
      <li>Was thrilled to find it on line because i have a hard time finding it in stores.</li>
      <li>, I was very sceptical about ordering it but having used it for a few weeks now, I have to say I would happily order it again even if it is more expensive than other lip creams.</li>
      <li>Before I give my two cents on this product, let it be known that I am twenty years old.</li>
      <li>I use this product several times a day and really have noticed a difference.  </li>
      <li>However, I was pleasantly surprised upon trying it.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t a miracle for anyone with intense lip lines but it does improve the overall appearance of your lips.</li>
      <li>if I didn&#x27;t wear lipstick/lipgloss as they were very colourless but since starting to use this I haven&#x27;t needed to wear lipstick unless I wanted to.</li>
      <li>I do not think this works as well as applying hyaluronic acid w/vitamin C serum to my lips, which does give a more hydrated, semi-plumping effect, at least for me.</li>
      <li>Peptides are really the only thing I have read that have any impact on wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>this product is one of the only items i have found that stops lipstick bleeding into the wrinkle lines around the mouth and when you are older</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I apply this treatment before bed and wake up to amazing results! The lines in my lips are less visible, or gone all together. Unfortunately, you HAVE to use this consistently to keep seeing the results. If I miss an application it shows, but I assume that should be expected with moisturizing. When applying the product looks like you put lotion on your lips -- it&#x27;s white. that is why I apply it at night or when I am in the car by myself going for a longer drive.</li>
    <li> I love the way this stuff feels on my lips!  Not sure I can see huge difference but I haven&#x27;t been applying daily by any means.</li>
    <li> I applied product as directed.  No change at all in my lip lines. In my opinion a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several years.  I never had lines by my lips until I moved to Phoenix from NJ 7 years ago - within one year of being here and exposed to the strong sun - lines started popping out.  Bought this and it helps minimize the lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not happy about having them but this helps.  Maybe I should have stayed in NJ, lol</li>
    <li> Strangely this product seems to work better after it has aged a little.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  Too bad it has been discontinued</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S OK...KIND OF GREASY THOUGH</li>
    <li> Love it...buy it again...</li>
    <li> have used this product for years and even given it as a stocking stuffer. it is the best thing going for chapped lips.</li>
    <li> It actually works, the only problem i had was the pump didn&#x27;t pump when used. However, the important thing is the lotion makes the applied area more &amp;#34;full&amp;#34;  and adds volume. i even used it on my chin to get rid of some loose uneven areas.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed so glad it wasn&#x27;t expensive. Pretty thick like paste. Did not absorb easy. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again. Other sally products I do love.</li>
    <li> Will buy again.  If you&#x27;re look for a miracle, then get filler or surgery, but if you&#x27;re looking for a more refreshed, less lined look, this is a great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Love this peptide. Makes lines less  visible and adds smoothness to my lips</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, have been using this forever, but went to p/u at my store location where I buy this product and was told that it is being discontinued? WHAT!!</li>
    <li> For many years, this product has worked for me to diminish lines around my lips.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of products, some costing much more, and some totally &amp;#34;natural.&amp;#34; Nothing else works as well.  When it disappeared from stores where I live, I was really worried.  I&#x27;m very glad that I found it online.</li>
    <li> I use this product several times a day and really have noticed a difference.  I highly recommend for women with wrinkles around the mouth.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several weeks.  it moisturizes my lips, but I can not tell that it helps lip lines at all.  It has a slight, temporary tingle, but not much.  My lips feel softer, but that is about all I can say.</li>
    <li> I had very low expectations of this item, mainly because of its low price. However, I was pleasantly surprised upon trying it. I put it on before bed and immediately could feel my skin absorbing it and my lips slightly plumping up. I have been noticing lines around my mouth every morning when I wake up. The next day however, the lines were almost gone. I continued to use it and noticed daily improvement. However, don&#x27;t expect a miracle, like full lips or anything like that. This basically maintains healthy smooth lips, and I recommend using it in conjunction with Sally&#x27;s Radiance lipstick.. Definitely a great product for the price!</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Seeing results already.  Fine lines are reduced and lips&lt;br /&gt;are smoother. Wife is very satisfied</li>
    <li> This is my holy grail lip product. I have constant dry, cracked, painful lips my entire life. This has saved me. It blows my mind the difference this has made.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Keeps lips moist without being greasy.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great.  It goes on a little thick, so just use a little bit at a time.&lt;br /&gt;It does help diminish facial lines and creases.</li>
    <li> Did not care for the consistency of the product-very thick. It made me break out after daily use but I do have very sensitive skin compared to most.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it helps the fine lines around my mouth. Couldn&#x27;t find this on the shelf and decided to try online. I never ordered online before and was apprehensive about it. Received it in a timely manner and once again fell in love with throduct. It really helps with fine lines for the older woman.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product. I hope they never stop making it. I am starting to get those little lip lines. You know they ones they say smokers get? Well I&#x27;m not nor ever was a smoker and I still got them. This product brings results with a capital &amp;#34;R&amp;#34;. I decided to give this a try, after everything else I tried that didn&#x27;t work I thought why not. The reviews for it seemed on the positive side for the most part. I will tell you when you use this the first few times you will notice how thick the cream is and you will feel it when you put it on. At first I thought I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m going to like this but after about two days I stopped noticing it. Even though it&#x27;s thick, it penetrates into the skin somewhat quickly. And best of all it works! I noticed those annoying little lines have already started fading and my lips are wonderfully soft and smooth just like when I was a teen. This is the best product I have come across for the lips and lip area.</li>
    <li> Sally Hanson Peptide Lip Treatment really seems to improve the lines that I feel are caused by using a straw for years. The habit I have to get my dog&#x27;s attention doesn&#x27;t help,I whistle.</li>
    <li> Of course we are all looking for the magic lip treatment to take the wrinkles away but this one is a little too greasy for me.  It is slow to soak in and leaves a shine.  Lipstick won&#x27;t go over it very well but I think for a night treatment it might be a good thing as it will prevent dryness.</li>
    <li> This is pretty good lip moisturizer, but that&#x27;s what is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> ...but for the price I didn&#x27;t expect it to. It feels nice, lasts for awhile, and at least it doesn&#x27;t dry my lips even more, like some glosses &amp; lipsticks do. Probably won&#x27;t buy again, but glad I gave it a try.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and a great price.  I did notice a difference in a few days of usage..</li>
    <li> this product is one of the only items i have found that stops lipstick bleeding into the wrinkle lines around the mouth and when you are older this is a must!!!</li>
    <li> I thought this was for above the lip, but apparently its for the lips themselves.  I use it above the lip anyway.  It plumps the skin for awhile....does a fair job.  I&#x27;ve tried other products, and have come to realize that tough wrinkles above the lip probably require professional intervention to remove completely!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay ! See little improvement. Still need to have the dermatologist put fillers in.</li>
    <li> This is not a plumping product per se, although well-hydrated lips are naturally fuller than dry lips. I like how well this product absorbs into my lips. I had one tiny line appearing above my lip and now it is gone. I am not jazzed about the scent, but it is not offensive. I just prefer unscented products. I do not think this works as well as applying hyaluronic acid w/vitamin C serum to my lips, which does give a more hydrated, semi-plumping effect, at least for me. But as a moisturizer, Sally Hansen&#x27;s peptide is a nice lip treatment. I plan to use this along with my hyaluronic serum, but I probably won&#x27;t reorder this product, since the serum is something I use all over my face and neck. This is a really good product for the price.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference what so ever. Will not be purchasing again. Nothing changed. Doesn&#x27;t even give a good feel when on.</li>
    <li> Didnt see any results</li>
    <li> Great product, have used it for years.</li>
    <li> Nothing makes a girl look older than lines around the lips.  This really works.  I see real results with this product.  Difficult to find tho--so I buy it when I see it.</li>
    <li> Have used for years and the best treatment at a good price I&#x27;ve found....</li>
    <li> The only good thing about this item is that it kept my lips moist. Used it over a month &amp; it did not fill in my lines.</li>
    <li> Before I give my two cents on this product, let it be known that I am twenty years old. I am all about preventing aging.This product intrigued me because it was so inexpensive, and because it contains peptides, which are the second most popular anti-aging ingredient - right behind retinol. I have used this treatment on and off for about a month.This product lessens the appearance of lines immediately with its moisturizing ingredients. I apply this at night before I go to bed, and the product softens my lips by morning. Of course, my lips aren&#x27;t lineless as a result of this product (I wouldn&#x27;t want them to be, anyhow), but it does make the lips appear smoother. This isn&#x27;t a miracle for anyone with intense lip lines but it does improve the overall appearance of your lips.</li>
    <li> A lot of hype for one more product that doesn&#x27;t deliver</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I have ever used I put it on at night and in the morning my lips look full and plump! LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Used this for years and for me if used twice a day,  works .</li>
    <li> After reading the various posts I had high hopes this would help temporarily fill in the vertical lines above my upper lip.  It helps only slightly.  Not sure I will purchase again.  It&#x27;s a shame because the price is great.</li>
    <li> No...  This did nothing for me.  Sorry!</li>
    <li> I had used this product yrs ago but could no longer buy it at Ulta. It works so much better than similar products sold in dpt store cosmetic Dpts. Keeps your lipliner &amp; lip stick from bleeding into fine lines around the mouth.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this product for a while and was so excited to find it on this website. It is an awesome product for aging thin lips!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for awhile now and I am very happy with it. . I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend! If it is still available.I have been using it for several years and am very impressed with the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  I love this product.  I can&#x27;t find it at Walgreens anymore so I like to order it on line.  Thanks</li>
    <li> made my lips feel much fuller. just ordered 2 more bottles. finally found  something that actually does what I wanted it to do!</li>
    <li> I like this product; I think it works.  But peptites have become very popular and as a result have really gone up in price.  This twenty some dollar bottle doesnt last but a week or two.</li>
    <li> very moisturizing, works as well as any other expensive product I have used.  Peptides are really the only thing I have read that have any impact on wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks now and my fine lines are going away! I think I will be buying this affordable alternative for all the ladies in my family for Christmas :)</li>
    <li> I admit, I am somewhat disappointed in this product. I actually see no difference and am using several times a day.</li>
    <li> Same as the other Sally Hansen product I bought.  I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money again on any of these products.</li>
    <li> Lipcare  Really help my lip lines.  They look much better. Fl. Sun dries out my lips.great product. I would recommend highly.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product. I have been using Elizabeth Arden 8 Hour cream for years on lips and have always thought it was fantastic however lately I&#x27;ve been finding that in spite of using it regularly, my lips are still flaking and cracking. I saw this recommended on another website &amp; thought I would give it a go. Since using it I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in the condition of lips and also in the definition around my lip line. I used to look like I had no lips if I didn&#x27;t wear lipstick/lipgloss as they were very colourless but since starting to use this I haven&#x27;t needed to wear lipstick unless I wanted to. Due to it not being available here and therefore beinga  bit more expensive when you have to add in shipping etc, I was very sceptical about ordering it but having used it for a few weeks now, I have to say I would happily order it again even if it is more expensive than other lip creams.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for few years now. Was thrilled to find it on line because i have a hard time finding it in stores. My lips are so grateful for the pampering.</li>
    <li> Very, very good product...hope it&#x27;s around forever!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I wish this came in a large bottle.  I&#x27;d put it all over my face.</li>
    <li> it does what it says, really good product, my lines desappear.</li>
    <li> Searched locally, not to be found, so i search the net and found it here! Fair pricing and quick service too!</li>
    <li> I love this treatment and I was lucky to find it.</li>
