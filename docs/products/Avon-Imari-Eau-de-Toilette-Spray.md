<li> It has a subtle smell, but not long lasting.</li>
<li> I have this on my Dresser all the time, the other one is just wright for my Purse.</li>
<li> Thank-you Avon for not letting me down.</li>
<li> I have been using this for years...but just found out that I can purchase it from Amazon for less $$</li>
<li> but it is useless.</li>
<li> BUT, Avon online won&#x27;t let me order perfume without going through a rep, and I hate reps because they operate slow</li>
<li> So disappointed and can&#x27;t return or get a return.</li>

    <li> I LOVE. LOVE Imari I have this on my Dresser all the time, the other one is just wright for my Purse. LOVE  LOVE, IT  Mary</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, and Far Away also. BUT, Avon online won&#x27;t let me order perfume without going through a rep, and I hate reps because they operate slow and I don&#x27;t always get the great deals I can straight from the online store. I was elated to find this here! I love the oriental scents.</li>
    <li> When I received it it was used not new</li>
    <li> Story line was very good and kept me looking toward to each chapter.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping new in box item.</li>
    <li> Thank-you Avon for not letting me down. It was what I had ordered, and as advertised exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> I already submitted one review but they would not print it because I mention the name of the business that I purchased from. Which I don&#x27;t understand because the review is posted on their web site. Anyway this is my wife&#x27;s favorite cologne and we found it to be a very good bargain on a certain web site and she is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Avon sells very nice fragrances for woman and this happens to be one.  Love it.</li>
    <li> i got this as a gift for a very dear friend, and they are very happy with it</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years...but just found out that I can purchase it from Amazon for less $$ and I receive it in two days!&lt;br /&gt;What could be better than that?</li>
    <li> It just smells  GOOD!!!</li>
    <li> I love this one it smell so good.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  Great Price!!!</li>
    <li> Do not buy!! This cologne is not the same product as one purchased directly from Avon. Initially you have scent but it is not the original Imari scent and has almost a alkaline base scent with a tiny bit of the original scent mixed in.  Scent does not last. Within one hour you or anyone else can not smell the fragrance. I have worn this fragrance since it first came out in the early 80s so I do know what it is supposed to smell like and this is not it!!  I ordered a lot of these thinking it was a good deal on this product but it is useless. First I thought it was just one defective but over time have realized that all of them ordered here were the same. I have yet to use even a fourth from any one as the scent does not smell.  If you spray this on fabric and wait there is no subtle fragrance or anything. So disappointed and can&#x27;t return or get a return. What a rip off. I ended up ordering from Avon and paying the higher price but at least I got what I paid for.  I would have not given it even one star but Amazon doesn&#x27;t allow that.</li>
    <li> This is the only cologne I can use.  The price is great.  I hope I can get this again from the same person.</li>
    <li> My grandmother loves this Spray!!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume! I received it way sooner than I thought I would! I will definitely always be ordering when I get low. I&#x27;m soooo happy!! Thank You!!!! :)</li>
    <li> I can not understand why Avon stopped making this product. I loved it in the 80&#x27;s and love it now. It&#x27;s another &amp;#34;Emeraude&amp;#34; - timeless!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and have been wearing it for years.  I feel naked without it.  Not to much not to little... it&#x27;s just right.</li>
    <li> Came as expected and everything works.Someone requested I buy this for them.Box was damaged slightly but spray is good.I always get damaged items from ups</li>
    <li> Wife really loves this product.  Got to admit I do too.  Cheaper here than on Avon website.</li>
    <li> This is my FAVORITE perfume!!!! It&#x27;s so fresh and clean with a nice mellow scent. I have received lovely&lt;br /&gt;compliments every time I wear it.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly and packaged nicely! Would buy again from Avon when I run out of what I have. Would recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> Took a while but thank you so much !</li>
    <li> Whenever I wear Imari people comment on how nicely the fragrance smells on me.  This always brings me back to Imari and Amazon brought me back to Imari with a price I can afford.</li>
    <li> I got her this Imari for mothers days and she was very please and very well happy with the cologne.</li>
    <li> Just what my wife uses.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this cologne spray cant wait to order again....</li>
