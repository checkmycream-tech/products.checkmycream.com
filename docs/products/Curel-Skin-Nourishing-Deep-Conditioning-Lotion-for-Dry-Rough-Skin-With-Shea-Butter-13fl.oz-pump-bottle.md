      <li>Nice aroma.</li>
      <li>I had read an article that this was one of the best drugstore buys as far as lotions go.  </li>
      <li>this is the most effective lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Its feel is very light (almost not there) and works.  </li>
      <li>I love this lotion.</li>
      <li>Perfect, light natural scent.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s lotion on your arm; it simply feels like your arm, but the best condition your skin has ever been</li>

      <li>I have used so many lotions, and this lotion in just one day changed my skin.</li>

      <li>love this stuff.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t find it in most stores.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite one</li>
      <li>I appreciate this more and more.  </li>
      <li>and I love the lotion.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a neutral, clean scent, and should coordinate nicely with anything from flowery to musky scents, to even going au naturale.</li>
      <li>I thank all the nice ladies that took the time to describe the fragrance of the lotion, it is true...</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the only reason I&#x27;ve rated this four stars, though that is a very good problem to have.</li>
      <li>even the most absent-minded users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light, and I wear it with products with shea butter or vanilla scents.</li>
      <li>Have been using this more than 5 years and keeps my skin smooth.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive eczema prone skin, and this body lotion keeps my eczema under control while making my skin feel great.</li>
      <li>I love the quality of the product, the effectiveness of moisturizing my dry skin, and it smells good!</li>
      <li>The honey/vanilla scent is very mild and soothing.</li>
      <li>Curel skin nourishing lotion for dry skin with Honey Shea Butter &amp; Vanilla feels very good on the skin.</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of this product, which will probably be discontinued as soon as this is published.  </li>
      <li>Once you do adapt to differing amounts for the varying states of your skin, this lotion is fantastic.</li>
      <li>This lotion smells fantastic - and the fact that it comes in a pump means I don&#x27;t have to get my lotion-y hands all over the bottle as I try to apply it.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m unique.</li>
      <li>The closest thing I can describe the application of this lotion is being squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>Dry elbows and knees and even callused feet benefit greatly.</li>
      <li>My dry eczema patches have improved greatly.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many different lotions without much success, and with the drying effects of winter, this is a definate keeper for me!!!  </li>
      <li>but: very light fragrance, very feminine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found to get my skin through the winter, better than the other Curel versions, so I will stock up again on it if it doesn&#x27;t show back up on the pharmacy shelves.</li>
      <li>Not expensive and efficient!</li>
      <li>I just love it, and I am picky + sensitive to perfume.</li>
      <li>It seems to be a good product for the average person.</li>
      <li>Smells really nice and leaves my skin soft if not a little sticky.</li>
      <li>but this Curel Skin lotion is not worse than Estee lauder!  </li>
      <li>Give yourself a bit of time to get used to it, and you&#x27;ll love the immediate and lasting benefits of this lotion.</li>
      <li>and it really works!</li>
      <li>The lotion works well, doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin and smells fabulous.</li>
      <li>While it&#x27;s very versatile, it&#x27;s almost too effective; even on applications to slightly dry areas like my elbows, a pea-sized amount is close to overkill.</li>
      <li>The lotion is great but 12.99 is a ridiculous price.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky, has a pleasant smell, and just know a very little goes a long way!!!  : )</li>
      <li>I still use pure shea butter on my elbows, but these days I don&#x27;t need as much.</li>
      <li>This is a really moisturizing lotion,thick and creamy.  </li>
      <li>and this did absolutely nothing for it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very nourishing for my skin.</li>
      <li>but it is no longer available locally, in this type, anyway.  </li>
      <li>Moisturizers well, has a good texture (not runny or super thick like some other lotions), and smells so good without having a heavy scent.</li>
      <li>This lotion has a light and pleasing scent while it soothes dry skin.</li>
      <li>Tried many different brands for body and finally found that works on my body.  </li>
      <li>I am pleasantly pleased to report that even on the second day, (and morning of the third)...</li>
      <li>Says it is mild enough for the face</li>
      <li>/&gt;While I&#x27;ve used this somewhat sparingly for normal skin in the summertime, this lotion truly shines in the so-called &amp;#34;problem areas&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Believe when I say, it is very hard to find something that pleases my wife as well as this did; I got more than my moneys worth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pretty large size so it lasts a long time even if you&#x27;re liberal with your application.</li>
      <li>and I cannot find it in stores where I live.</li>
      <li>quickly so you don&#x27;t feel like you have to wave your hands around to get it to dry</li>
      <li>Normally I have to buy unscented for my sensitive skin, but this doesn&#x27;t even irritate my face.</li>
      <li>This is well worth the price, and the bottle lasts a very long time.</li>
      <li>The texture and consistency was entirely different than the normal texture and consistency of the Curel honey, vanilla &amp; shea butter lotion.</li>
      <li>My only recommendation to the company is to investigate new packaging.</li>
      <li>It also sinks in *really</li>
      <li>My skin is never dry, itchy or flaky.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my skin soft &amp; supple all day long.</li>
      <li>I have very dry mature skin</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have type 2 diabetes and this is the only lotion that takes care of my dry skin.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for 20+ years.  My skin is never dry, itchy or flaky.  As I age I appreciate this more and more.  Great Product!!</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of this product, which will probably be discontinued as soon as this is published.  In any of its formulas it keeps my very dry skin moistened without being greasy and I will be buying it as long as I can find it.</li>
    <li> No question - for my skin type this is the most effective lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. The honey/vanilla scent is very mild and soothing. My only recommendation to the company is to investigate new packaging. It&#x27;s hard to get the last bit out of the container. I end up cutting the top off so I can scoop out the contents. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, and she says it works like magic!  It is not greasy, or cake-like, her skin is softer and clearer.  Believe when I say, it is very hard to find something that pleases my wife as well as this did; I got more than my moneys worth.</li>
    <li> I have used Curel for over 15 years. I have tried other brands but always go back to Curel. This is my favorite one and I cannot find it in stores where I live. I love the quality of the product, the effectiveness of moisturizing my dry skin, and it smells good!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion and it&#x27;s smells good too. I could never find it in stores though so always have to order online</li>
    <li> The product is being used by my parents, they are in their 90 years of age, my sister let me know if they are running out, so I&#x27;ve to order them again &amp; sent it to the Philippines, it must be good cause they keep on repeating the order!!!</li>
    <li> I have used Estee Lauder which is more expensive than this one! but this Curel Skin lotion is not worse than Estee lauder!  Not expensive and efficient! My skin is extremely dry. I feel my skin keeping moist only after using this lotion. I love that and I will recommend it to me friends and relatives!</li>
    <li> love this stuff. can&#x27;t find it in most stores. doesn&#x27;t clog pores or have an alcohol effect. BEST LOTION EVER.</li>
    <li> I had read an article that this was one of the best drugstore buys as far as lotions go.  I am pleasantly pleased to report that even on the second day, (and morning of the third)...(hey it&#x27;s the weekend)...I still feel it on my skin!!!  I have tried many different lotions without much success, and with the drying effects of winter, this is a definate keeper for me!!!  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky, has a pleasant smell, and just know a very little goes a long way!!!  : )</li>
    <li> Curel skin nourishing lotion for dry skin with Honey Shea Butter &amp; Vanilla feels very good on the skin. I love the sent of the honey and Shea butter. This was hard to find and it only comes in this one size. 13fl. OZ  Pity.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It gets rid of the bumps on the backs of my arms after a good scrub brushing. It makes my skin feel silky and keeps the moisture in. It isn&#x27;t sticky or heavy on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive eczema prone skin, and this body lotion keeps my eczema under control while making my skin feel great. It smells amazing too. I have been using this product since college, and I am now almost 30.</li>
    <li> This lotion has a light and pleasing scent while it soothes dry skin. I definitely recommend this product for everyone.</li>
    <li> but it is no longer available locally, in this type, anyway.  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found to get my skin through the winter, better than the other Curel versions, so I will stock up again on it if it doesn&#x27;t show back up on the pharmacy shelves.</li>
    <li> Curel is the best lotion i have found. And the honey, vanilla and shae smells so good! It is gentle enough to put on my small children.. and it really works!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It&#x27;s very nourishing for my skin. Keeps my skin soft &amp; supple all day long.</li>
    <li> I received this bottle today.  I read and reread the ingredients and I do not see where there is any honey or vanilla!  I ordered the brand simply because it advertised the honey and vanilla.  I went to have a pedicure and the girl used honey and vanilla on my feet.  She told me that there was a lotion that had these ingredients in it.  I will have to wait until I visit that salon again to get the name of the brand that she uses.  I am somewhat dosappointed.</li>
    <li> Smells really nice and leaves my skin soft if not a little sticky.</li>
    <li> I suffer from extremely dry skin and I also have eczema on my elbows.  This is a really moisturizing lotion,thick and creamy.  My dry eczema patches have improved greatly.  I still use pure shea butter on my elbows, but these days I don&#x27;t need as much.</li>
    <li> I just love it, and I am picky + sensitive to perfume. I wore fragrance when I was younger and perfumed lotion but I can&#x27;t anymore. It just give me a headache or I get tired of the smell. This one fits me perfect and the lotion is very moisturizing. I have dry skin and I need to wear lotion after a shower of after I went outside in the sun. I thank all the nice ladies that took the time to describe the fragrance of the lotion, it is true...it&#x27;s a bit vanilla, a little bit butter and with a pinch of powder but: very light fragrance, very feminine. I used Curel in the 90&#x27;s and I love the lotion. With shea butter and that light smell; I think it&#x27;s the best lotion I ever bought...and I will buy again!</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best!  Moisturizers well, has a good texture (not runny or super thick like some other lotions), and smells so good without having a heavy scent.</li>
    <li> Perfect, light natural scent. Normally I have to buy unscented for my sensitive skin, but this doesn&#x27;t even irritate my face. It&#x27;s emollient and absorbs well with no sticky residue.</li>
    <li> Good price quick shipping, and this lotion is just the best. I have used so many lotions, and this lotion in just one day changed my skin. I will do business with them again!!</li>
    <li> I have very dry mature skin and this did absolutely nothing for it. I ended up returning it. Says it is mild enough for the face but the next day my face broke out.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this lotion years ago, and I have been using it ever since. I only had one place I could find the Shea butter version and now they don&#x27;t sell it anymore. So thankful that Amazon.com is selling it. This lotion is the best. Non-greasy, moisturizes well and has a beautiful sent.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this lotion</li>
    <li> Best lotion on the market!</li>
    <li> This lotion smells fantastic - and the fact that it comes in a pump means I don&#x27;t have to get my lotion-y hands all over the bottle as I try to apply it. It&#x27;s a pretty large size so it lasts a long time even if you&#x27;re liberal with your application. It also sinks in *really* quickly so you don&#x27;t feel like you have to wave your hands around to get it to dry; I use it after I wash my hands and it sinks in almost instanteously. Plus, for the price ($6 - or less thru subscribe and save) it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
    <li> The Curel lotion that I received through the seller Pharmapacks at Amazon has been diluted or something. The texture and consistency was entirely different than the normal texture and consistency of the Curel honey, vanilla &amp; shea butter lotion. I have used this product for years and have always loved it. The lotion works well, doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin and smells fabulous. However, all 4 bottles I received from Pharmapacks were too liquidy and less creamy than normal. In addition, 3 of the pumps would not function properly. All of this points to tampering with the product. I will not order from this seller (Pharmapacks) again!!!</li>
    <li> It solves my dry skin problem. I just wish it was good smelling too, may be floral!</li>
    <li> Nice aroma. I have extra dry skin so it still did not take care of all my problems but I&#x27;m unique. It seems to be a good product for the average person.</li>
    <li> Curel is no longer making this version of their product.  I have used this for years and loved it. I get so frustrated when companies quit making a product that works and that I love and have used for years.  I wonder due to this,if the product you can still get thru Amazons suppliers is old.</li>
    <li> The lotion is great but 12.99 is a ridiculous price.  I order this 3 months ago and paid 6.22.</li>
    <li> Tried many different brands for body and finally found that works on my body.  Its feel is very light (almost not there) and works.  Have been using this more than 5 years and keeps my skin smooth.</li>
    <li> This lotion takes a bit to get used to. I&#x27;m a recent convert from &amp;#34;body butter&amp;#34; types, where you equate being moisturized with the almost greasy smoothness of the lotion. The closest thing I can describe the application of this lotion is being squeaky clean. It doesn&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s lotion on your arm; it simply feels like your arm, but the best condition your skin has ever been in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;ve used this somewhat sparingly for normal skin in the summertime, this lotion truly shines in the so-called &amp;#34;problem areas&amp;#34;. Dry elbows and knees and even callused feet benefit greatly. I literally felt the difference after one application. I usually resorted to removing the harder skin on my overworked feet, but this lotion holds true to its promise to improve the actual quality of your skin. While it&#x27;s very versatile, it&#x27;s almost too effective; even on applications to slightly dry areas like my elbows, a pea-sized amount is close to overkill. That&#x27;s the only reason I&#x27;ve rated this four stars, though that is a very good problem to have. The mindset in using this lotion is different than applying Bath and Body Works style lotions, where you can apply the same amount everywhere. Once you do adapt to differing amounts for the varying states of your skin, this lotion is fantastic. It&#x27;s not even necessary to use it religiously to obtain benefit; the results last long enough for even the most absent-minded users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light, and I wear it with products with shea butter or vanilla scents. It&#x27;s more of a neutral, clean scent, and should coordinate nicely with anything from flowery to musky scents, to even going au naturale. This is well worth the price, and the bottle lasts a very long time. Give yourself a bit of time to get used to it, and you&#x27;ll love the immediate and lasting benefits of this lotion.</li>
