<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is ok , it work better than most product  I used before</li>
    <li> I use it as both an after shave and Face Cream.  After I wrote the previous sentence praising the product my &amp;#34;excellent rating&amp;#34; was refused unless I wrote at least 9 more words!  Here are my &amp;#34;additional words&amp;#34;:  I am very happy with the product and extremely annoyed with your so-called rating system requirements!</li>
    <li> I am 22 years old, and I have combination skin. I am not normally prone to acne, however for the past couple months I have been battling breakouts. I have also had some issues with my skin&#x27;s complexion being a little uneven. I decided to pick up the Garnier Nutritioniste Skin Renew Daily Regenerating Moisture Cream. I did not research on it, and I had no recommendations from a friend. I picked it up on a whim. The cream is not too heavy and it is not greasy as long as you let it soak in, which does not take long at all. My only 2 complaints are minor. Sometimes the moisturizer burns the skin around my eyes, but this has stopped. Also, the moisturizer will peel off while putting makeup on over it, but I suspect this is due to putting too much on at once. Since I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer, my acne has almost completely cleared up, and my skin complexion is also becoming smoother and clearer. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has dry skin but is dealing with acne.</li>
    <li> I have combo skin, and I don&#x27;t need a lot of help to keep it healthy. With the Az summer coming I wanted something creamy and rich to help me. I have watery eyes sometimes and tend to get rub lines next to my eyes. This moisturizer stung so bad by my eyes, and I do not have sensitive skin. It also made me break out, after a week of using it I gave it to my husband. He is a bit more oily then I am and he loves it. Guess it just my skin type that didn&#x27;t get along with it. Great smell, good consistency, and a little goes a long way. I wont buy it again, but it wasn&#x27;t a total bust, it gave my skin a dewy glow to it.</li>
    <li> While I like how this product makes my skin look, some of the ingredients are worrisome such as:probyl paraben and limonen. Please reformulate to make product safer for consumer use.</li>
    <li> Love this, have a hard time finding it. Great for oily skin.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Really good for the face and keeps the skin firm.</li>
    <li> We bought some of this at Wal Mart 6 months ago because it had no Methylparaben (linked to cancer in some studies) and my wife loved it on her face. Now I bought two jars from Amazon (Wal Mart no longer has it) and surprise, it has Methylparaben. So I have to give a tweener review. It works great if you want to take the cancer risk.</li>
    <li> I really love this moisturizer! My skin became a bit drier in the past couple of years and I needed a slightly richer moisturizer than the Garnier Moisture Rescue Refresh Gel Creme--the one I had been using and loving. I tried both the Radiance Moisture Cream Skin Renew and the Ultra Lift. Both are good products, but the Ultra Lift was just too heavy for my sensitive skin. I have been using the Radiance for two years now and I won&#x27;t be changing unless my skin does. It is the perfect weight for both day and night. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have sunscreen in it, as my skin cannot take chemical sunscreens. It feels good going on and absorbs right away. Added bonus--it comes in a nice, glass jar that looks great in my bathroom and feels like the much pricier department store products.</li>
    <li> Smooth and penetrating, easily and quickly absorbed, leaving the skin supple and well hydrated. Lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used on dry skin for over two years with great satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could be improved by the addition of a sun blocker.</li>
    <li> Well the cream looks good.  Whatever is left in there.  The box arrived damaged and was already opened. When I opened the jar of cream? There was a hair in it and some of the cream was gone.</li>
    <li> I wish I could get a refund on this product. I tried it 3 times and it burns my face&lt;br /&gt;and eyes. I have to go wash it off immediately. I&#x27;ve never had sensitive skin, but&lt;br /&gt;this product burns!!</li>
    <li> Still the best face cream I can find for the money! Light, absorbs easily, and  moisturizes well. Leaves my skin looking hydrated yet not greasy.</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best face lotion I have ever used EVER. And I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of lotions/moisturizers/creams looking for a replacement for this product since it&#x27;s been discontinued. I was extremely upset when they discontinued this since it got rid of my crow&#x27;s feet and wrinkles beneath my eyes. They came back when I discontinued use. I hadn&#x27;t used this lotion for about 6 months before I finally found this online again. I plan to buy more and hope for the best when the day comes when they don&#x27;t sell any more of this stuff online. I was also initially worried about getting a new product, since many other reviews stated that the product was open/used when received. I didn&#x27;t have this problem and I ordered from Hardy&#x27;s Discount.</li>
    <li> I just started using this moisture cream. I think it&#x27;s okay but after researching some ingredients like limonene  i was hesitant to use it because i have dermatitis and rather use my eucerine or gold bond for eczema. It states it can sensitize my eczema  I am just NOT okay with this chemical in my face cream that i will use on a daily basis on my skin. It has a lot of ingredients i can be allergic to  yet it says allergy tested and gentle to skin and dermatologist tested for safety and 100% oil free, Hmmmm. A lot of promises stated.  Who really knows. I initially tried to return it but it was NOT eligible for return.  It smells okay not too over powering,let&#x27;s see if it does what it states in 3 weeks. Skin will be radiant and fine lines are visibly reduced.  I won&#x27;t hold my breath.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, great price</li>
    <li> This  face cream is really heavily scented, I found the smell cloying.&lt;br /&gt;As for the performance it went on nicely and wasn&#x27;t greasy feeling or heavy.  If you don&#x27;t like perfumed products this one is not for you.  I don&#x27;t mind lightly scented but this one was over the top for me, I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> This is the worst stuff you could put on your face ladies. I just bought this and didn&#x27;t have my glasses on to read the ingredients . So figured well its moisture rescue so shouldn&#x27;t have no alcohol in it..put it on my face and nothing absorbs in the skin that fast . I new I was sucker punched..wow only thing that can dry that fast is alcohol ..get home and look at the ingredients and yes the 3rd ingredient is alcohol denat ....omg why would you put this crap on your face its the same stuff they use for paint thinner..keep using this stuff and you will look old at a younger age ..what a joke..it will dry your face out ..how can they call it moisture recuse. They put that in there so you think its absorbs in the skin when its not its drys as fast as it hits air..and on your face..I would love to give it a zero because its so deceiving with the name moisture rescue..there&#x27;s no moisture</li>
    <li> I really love this product, it&#x27;s inexpensive but does the job.  It&#x27;s very light, doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out, and improves my skin tone.</li>
    <li> I love this. Not only does it smell wonderful, it also kept my skin soft to the touch, even after just one use. I absolutely adore this! I have sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t bug my skin at all. It&#x27;s hard for me to find products for my skin but this didn&#x27;t let me down at all. Definitely going to keep using it!</li>
    <li> Love the feel and smell of this moisturizer! Very light weight. Hate that Garnier discontinued it. Grateful I can still find it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> No longer manufactured, love it!</li>
    <li> The product I received does not contain caffeine as shown in the pics. The renew product I received contains magnesium instead. I went ahead and opened because i didn&#x27;t want to wait as it took 11 days to get here in the first place. The box was beat up, product does not seem new.</li>
    <li> I have used high end products for many years but recently decided this has been a major waste of money.  The choice of paying $50 for the same size of moisturizer and this product was enough to tempt me since we love the shampoo.  I decided to give it a try and it&#x27;s a keeper.  I am now a convert.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace my usual buy of the Garnier Clinical Dark Spot Corrector. Seems to work pretty well, doesn&#x27;t get my face greasy and absorbs very well. My only draw back is after wearing it all day my face does begin to feel a little oily compared to what I was usually initially.</li>
    <li> This is so awesome ! I got it free b/c I had an amazon $10 gift card for opening an Amazon acct.  I had already had a bottle, and was running out ! This came Quickly ! I&#x27;m so happy it did. This is the BEST moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever had. And it sinks into the skin. Not oily in the least bit. Smells excellent. I love ALL Garnier products ! I recommend this face cream to Anyone ! :)</li>
    <li> My wife uses this as a cream that she puts on before she puts on her foundation in the morning and sometimes at night as a moisturizing cream. She likes it a lot as it is not thick and it quickly absorbs into her skin. She likes it as it does not clog her pours and it quickly is absorbed and moisturizes her skin and helps prevent wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between the stress on her skin from the sun in the summer and from dry weather in the winter this cream helps her to repair and minimize any damage that may be caused by the effects if the weather. She can also be slightly allergic to some conditioners and this one doesn&#x27;t bother her at all. She likes it a lot and she rates it as a 5 star product.</li>
    <li> I have gone through 2 of these and I have to say that I like it a lot. I used to apply this cream at night but it kind of make my face oily in the morning so I tried use it in the morning and it works great plus this cream smell so refreshing! Great for day cream!</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and over the years have tried many moisturizing creams.  most of them are too heavy--leave my skin too oily--or cause my skin to break out.  this cream is perfect---absorbs fast--is light and best of all does not cause any breakouts.  i will order more before i run out.</li>
    <li> Happy to find this product that is no longer offered in our local stores.  My wife likes it better than any of the alternatives.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past 5 years or more and it works great.  It&#x27;s not greasy and leaves your skin nice and moisturized.  Package came very quickly.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and how it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> Very pleased, although I have not used long enough to see how we&#x27;ll it is working, I have noticed it has made the skin on my face very soft.</li>
    <li> Feels good to use this product.  I enjoy not having to remember to purchase it when I am almost out as it is on &amp;#34;subscription.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The cream seemed old.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Excellent product!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff; it does great things for my skin. However, it is getting harder and harder to find. Sadly, it&#x27;s the only scented face cream that I can tolerate. It has a pleasant smell, and most face cream scents are unpleasant to me (low tolerance for environmental smells). It&#x27;s unfortunate that they seem to have stopped making it.</li>
    <li> This is the single best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used - it feels good, it smells great, it dries without leaving you oily and has been so great for my super-dry skin. Sadly, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get now, so this review likely won&#x27;t help anyone - but if you happen upon this product, buy it, it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> I have a combo of dry and oily skin and I am prone to breaking out when I use lotion.  I have tried tons of products and this is by far the best product I have ever used.  After about a week of using this lotion, my coworker asked me where I got my facial done at.  I told her I started using this lotion, and she did not believe me.  Now that is a compliment.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer, light feeling on the skin. Wonderful smell.</li>
    <li> this is my second bottle, help my skin to renew. when you applied, it&#x27;s not too oily, and is also very easy to absorb.</li>
    <li> I like Garnier products in general but I like this product in particular.  I like the feel of the product and the results - clear, radiant complexion.  I like that it is noncomedogenic and non-greasy. I like what is in the product (including some magnesium which is good for the skin)and what is not in the product - sunscreen.  It is easy to find sunscreen-free night cream for the face but much harder to find lighter weight daytime face cream without sunscreen in it.  I prefer to add sunscreen only when needed - not every day.</li>
    <li> I really love this cream! i used to use it all the time, but then it was gone for long time, and now finally its back in stores.&lt;br /&gt;I love the light and non greasy formula of this cream. and it smells really nice too. Leaves my skin nice and soft and smooth! i would definetly recomend this to my friends!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find in retail stores. Lightweight and not greasy. Stocked up because fiancé loves the scent more than my extremely expensive perfumes!</li>
    <li> This Garnier Radiance Moisture Cream has been the answer to my needs. Many products moisturize adequately, but this product serves also as a great base for my make-up foundation.  It is the only one I have tried that leaves a such a smooth, natural.  For me, there is no reason to try other face moisturizers, this is my new moisturizer of choice!</li>
    <li> Really great product for the value.  I cannot live without this. Visible improvement.  Non greasy. Smells great</li>
    <li> My favorite skin cream, used to buy it at the drugstore for much more, great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I used to buy facial moisturizer that cost close to 100 dollars, then tried this moisture cream and loved it!!  It works as well as the expensive kind, even better, as I use it daily because cost isn&#x27;t prohibitive, and the fragrance is mild. This cream leaves my face soft and hydrated, which is a lot to ask for a 62 year old face that has been out-of-doors most of it&#x27;s life!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this face cream! I use it every day and my skin has never looked so good. It is very silky smooth! I mix it with makeup and clear Aloe Vera Gel to make a face primer and it is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I have been searching for the perfect face cream for my dry/acneic skin and was hoping this product would be the one. After using it every day for about a month and a half i have to say it is not my favorite cream. It goes on incredibly smooth which i loved and leaves a great smooth non greasy finish but i felt the fragrance was a bit overpowering. The reason i have stopped using this product is because after about a month of use i started breaking out pretty bad and switched to the Simple brand day cream, i absolutely love it and have had no problems yet!</li>
    <li> So I received this cream in the mail today. I&#x27;ve been using it for quite a while, I just so happened to find it cheaper on Amazon than I did at Walmart. I opened the box, and the cream fell right out. Also, looking at an old, almost empty jar, the label is not only pixelated but it&#x27;s completely different. On the REAL bottle, it says 1.7 fl oz/ 50 g, the fake one says 50ml. last time i checked, those werent the same thing. If you flip over the real bottle and look at the bottom, there is a shimmer on the lotion. the one purchased from amazon does NOT. Also the texture of the cream is noticeably different. there are a lot more differences between the two BUT i feel ive said enough. dont put this on your face, you dont know what these people are making these products of. returning this, getting a FULL refund, and taking my ass back to walmart.</li>
    <li> Excellent and quick service</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this was not the product I was looking for. It works ok, but not like the product previously used.  Have had GREAT results though from the company overall.</li>
    <li> BY FAR MY FAVORITE FACE PRODUCT</li>
    <li> The best moisture cream I have ever used.  It&#x27;s a shame that Garnier has discontinued making it.</li>
    <li> It dries nice and feels moisturizing. But it stinks, has a very strong fragrance that burns the skin and eyes. And after wearing it all day I broke out with bumps and red spots. Not good.</li>
    <li> I received this moisture cream and it was opened!!! Box was opened and cream seal was removed half way and product was missing. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> the package should say makes you look years younger period. nothing more nothing less. and I say this as a Man.</li>
    <li> Does what it says. It&#x27;s light and has a nice sent to it. And it lasts a fairly long time.</li>
    <li> arrived on time  am looking forward 2 using this product  i like the dark spot remover  this product arrived exactly when they said</li>
    <li> I really like this moisture cream! I have been using it for a week and I haven&#x27;t broken out, my skin hasn&#x27;t dried out and the smell is subtle enough that it doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies. After cleansing my face and letting it dry, I apply the Garnier Radiance Moisture Cream. My skin feels hydrated without being greasy or oily. It&#x27;s just enough moisture to get me through the day. It&#x27;s light enough to wear under my make up, too. Just let it absorb before you put the make up on.</li>
