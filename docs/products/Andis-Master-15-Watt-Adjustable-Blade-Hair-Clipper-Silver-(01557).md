<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> She lover it would buy again</li>
    <li> Out of the box, it seemed like it was either previously used or it was just dirty with oil over much of the surface. Once I turned it on, I heard the buzz of the motor but I noticed that the blades were completely still. I have asked Amazon for a replacement, hopefully this was just an anomaly and the next one will be functional. But it seems like from reading other 1 star reviews, that I may have the same problem. Fingers crossed!</li>
    <li> muy responsables, llego a tiempo, muy responsables</li>
    <li> I purchased these without reading too many reviews because I am very familiar with the product and have used it before. This was advertised as NEW and was clearly USED! scratches on it, HAIR in the blade, and made a very loud noise. I am a professional hairdresser and am used to hearing this noise when blades need to be adjusted but have NEVER purchased a pair that needed to be adjusted right out of the box. Even with adjustment they were still making the noise. Called amazon and was overnighted a new pair and had the SAME issue. Unbelievable.</li>
    <li> This product was amazing and the price was very fair. I am glad I bought it because it increase my barbering skill. Thanks</li>
    <li> The Andis Masters is probably my go-to clipper when cutting. Highly recommend you try it, i switch it up between my wahl 5 star seniors, Osters and these. And the Masters are used the most.</li>
    <li> Great buy, Great Cost, Great Gift, Haven&#x27;t been used as of today but highly anticpating first time use of these!</li>
    <li> Clippers appeared to be used, and would not work when the blade was moved from open to closed. the clippers were listed as new but it was obvious they were used by the way they were packaged and the stuff that was on the blade.</li>
    <li> these are one of the best hair clippers, but there are pros and cons to the andis masters.&lt;br /&gt;THE PROS&lt;br /&gt;1. very precise cutting&lt;br /&gt;2.quiet clippers&lt;br /&gt;3.more powerful than the oster fast feed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE CONS&lt;br /&gt;1.they are heavy clipper, so if you self cut your hair i hope you go to the gym because your arms might feel tired.&lt;br /&gt;2. these clippers get extremely hot after 20 minutes of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was naive to the fact that these clippers are really meant for professional barbers. this is the first time that i self cut my hair and i like the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROBLEMS PEOPLE MAY HAVE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. the clippers are making a clatter loud sound- you have to adjust the clippers  by taking a flat head screw driver and i turning the SCREW on the side of the clippers CLOCKWISE until the clattering sound diminishes.&lt;br /&gt;2.the andis masters are not cutting closer than you thought- tpye in youtube how to adjust andis master clipper, that will help.&lt;br /&gt;3. oil the clippers. you get oil wth the masters. this preserves the clipper blades&lt;br /&gt;4. OPTIONAL- by the disenfectant spray because it cools the blade if you spray it on the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I hope this helped.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair for about 3 years now and I was debating on buying these for a while, i just thought to myself are they really worth the price.  I&#x27;ve bought 4 pairs of clippers now (including these) and i think they were definitely the best purchase yet. They were also the most expensive, but its like the old saying \\&quot;u get what u pay for\\&quot; and these are definitely worth the extra money. They are very precise with every cut!! nothing even comes close to these clippers!! I like how they have the \\&quot;steps\\&quot; on the side, it helps alot with the fading or tapering, it actually gives something to fade from instead of just having to guess. The only bad thing i found is that they get HOT after u have them on for about 20- 30 mins but other than that i dont think they could get any better</li>
    <li> if you&#x27;re serious about being a barber, this is a must have</li>
    <li> This is a pro clipper that a barber would use. It&#x27;s built like a tank! The motor seems strong too. I&#x27;ve had mine a year now, and use it every other day to buzz my head. It gets real close and never bites. I can see this clipper lasting decades. Awesome! I can&#x27;t see the heat being a problem for most people. Another reviewer complained that it got too hot after 45 minutes. Who uses it for that long? Not me. Any buzzer will create heat and friction on the blades and need to cool at some point. It&#x27;s getting hot because it has a powerful motor, and is dissipating heat. It won&#x27;t burn you! As far as complaints that it&#x27;s too heavy...I mean really? Hit the gym more if this is an issue. I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s heavy and built well. A case would be nice though.</li>
    <li> Bought this to give the boys Russell Wilson buzz cuts (when he was buzzed over the summer).  Works great.  Bought guards too, for the rest of the year.</li>
    <li> These are the best clippers I ever had. Heavy duty great quality clippers. The different settings of \\&quot;0\\&quot; makes giving a fade hairstyle a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is not about the clippers is with Andis. For the price I wish they would have added the clipper attachements with the machine. Other than that the product is worth it.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite clippers.  For the record, I have been through many of them. I have been cutting my own hair for the past 15 plus years and I am good at it. These clippers makes me every better. Warning!!! It is heavy but does a great job. Take good care of it and it will last a long time. I will be ordering  another one just to have on hand.</li>
    <li> The units build and cut quality is top notch but it does get hot.  Either get a glove or make rubber grip.</li>
    <li> Great tool for barbing the kids and adult&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I fade my hair on my own, and cut my friends up for practice... My little brother is a barber, so when he said this was the master clipper he used I had to take his advice. Upon purchasing, I found that this is the cleanest, most even clipper I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve bought off the shelf Wahls, and I thought they were unrivaled due to ease of use and that they came w/ clipper guards. These master clippers were so good, I even bought my brother another pair as a christmas present (since his power cord was falling apart)... Only point I wanted to mention is that because they are all metal, they have a tendancy of heating up after about 40 mins of use. Still, they are worth the purchase. If you buy these master clippers, think about picking up some T liners like I did. Perfect for getting fades skin tight. Good job Andis.</li>
    <li> I like these clippers a lot. They are very accurate and fast plus&lt;br /&gt;fast delivery from amazon(2 days).&lt;br /&gt;I am saving money now that I cut my own hair(I&#x27;ll still go to the&lt;br /&gt;salon on special occasions for good fades).The only thing that&lt;br /&gt;worried me on getting these clippers were the reviews saying&lt;br /&gt;that they get hot.As for me, they haven&#x27;t got hot on me(I use&lt;br /&gt;them between 10 and 25 minutes).I was planning on getting upscale&lt;br /&gt;cordless panasonics but I found that these andis looked well made&lt;br /&gt;and not very expensive.Everyone I showed these to were impressed(as for me also).I&#x27;m proud that these are American made and made awesome.I hope&lt;br /&gt;these last forever(thats what we all want, things that are well made&lt;br /&gt;and last forever).</li>
    <li> In the past, I always purchased the Wahl clippers for cutting my own hair at home. I will say that the Wahl&#x27;s have always been dependable, and I have no real gripes with those units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my most recent Wahl Clipper died (had over 4 years), I decided to take a look at the Andis Improved master based on a recommendation from by uncle who is a barber. Did some real searching online and finally found a great price on Amazon and bought it. Couldn&#x27;t be happier. The Andis Improved Master cuts evenly and stays incredibly cool. The adjustable blade really helps since it goes from a #0 to a #1 in a breeze. The weight of it really makes you feel like you&#x27;re using a high-end machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no wonder why this is one of the preferred clippers of barbers everywhere. Sorry Wahl.</li>
    <li> This product is very loud and is getting very hot after couple minutes of work. Product also does not cut very well. I bought the clipper work with them couple times and I did not find them good. VERY  LOUD DOES NOT WORK AS THEY SHOULD DO.[[ASIN:B000BBGS36 Andis 01557 Improved Master Professional Clipper]]</li>
    <li> been using whal clippers for 15yrs and finally decided to spend a little extra. you get what you pay for. a high quality clipper that not only gives a quality hair cutt but also looks the part as well. these clippers are heavy duty with a very nice chrome finish. very pleased with my purchase. buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> Less than a week after I bought this \\&quot;wonderful\\&quot; clipper, it already stopped working. Pathetic. But if you like shiny things that look nice but don&#x27;t work, go right on the hell and  buy this piece of junk. Built Ford soft. smh.</li>
    <li> Works well but gets very hot after a while.</li>
    <li> Great quality clippers will last you a lifetime if taken care of properly, I noticed a lot of people saying they&#x27;re loud and can&#x27;t stop it by tuning the screw on the side, go to my YOUTUBE CHANNEL GARRICK WHITE, Ihave a vedio on how to stop the loud CLATTERING a barber of 29yrs experience that should solve your problem, don&#x27;t understand why Andis would sell them this way but simple fix</li>
    <li> Great clipper meet all my expectations!!!!! Great service from the seller as well.</li>
    <li> I had an older Andis hair clipper that mysteriously went m.i.a. I&#x27;m not familiar with other hair clipper brands but familiar with the Andis reputation. These new clippers are very similar in design to my previous pair, but newer, quieter and a lot sharper. I have no real complaints about the Andis brand.</li>
    <li> It doesnt work. I tried to adjust with the screw on the side but nothing. When it comes you have to adjust everything again and yourself I saw many videos I think its a really good clipper but there are too much problems. I can&#x27;t even use it I bought the combs and the 60Hz converter. 234€ Total for nothing. Well not happy at all.</li>
    <li> Using it for my horses mane.  Works better than most.</li>
    <li> Clippers do a really great job! Heavy duty design makes for long lasting durability. I would recommend to anyone upgrading or in need of new clippers.</li>
    <li> Totally satisfied. You could shave a sheep easily with these clippers! They cut hair very efficiently.. To me they are far better than Wahls</li>
    <li> Very nice clippers. They cut through hair with little effort. Make sure you also buy the combs because they do not come with the clippers. The clippers seem to be well built and look like they can take a beating. They run quietly and fit your hand well. The biggest flaw is how heavy they are. Its not too much of a problem if you are cutting hair on other people but it takes some getting used to when you are cutting your own hair.</li>
    <li> The Andis master clipper that I have ordered have broke on me just few months after purchase, I decided to give it another try and ordered a second pair.  The second pair broke after a week! I&#x27;m still waiting for my refund! I do NOT recommend them to anyone!</li>
    <li> I got my clippers and of course in the box, it gives you the details on how to adjust them so why are there reviews on clattering sound when all you have to do is adjust them? I did the adjustment and they sound just fine. My Oral B spin brush makes more noise than this clipper. It does get hot but what do you expect? ITS A MOTOR! It doesn&#x27;t take 50 minutes to cut one person&#x27;s hair. Just get the Andis Cool Care and it&#x27;s fine. It&#x27;s all about following the directions and taking care of them. If you don&#x27;t take care of them and do the adjustments as stated, how can you expect it to work. Great clipper. Great power or torque. The only negative is that it&#x27;s heavier than most clippers but by only about 1 lb. difference and I think I&#x27;m strong enough to hold a 1.8 lb. clipper.</li>
    <li> Just a quick review after I completed a few haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;They are the most precise and clean clippers i have ever worked with, They do tend to get hot, but that is probably because I take a bit longer to assure I clean up the fade then im supposed to. Other then it getting a bit warm, this machine is really great. If you plan on using it ALL day back to back, I would either get 2 machines or use this solely to fade and blend, and use a Wahl clipper to take down the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...] &amp;lt;--- my youtube</li>
    <li> I recevied this item used with hair in clippers and scuff marks on the front. I would have returned but need them ASAP!</li>
    <li> This is a great product: solid, well-made, and works just fine.  A highly-recommended clipper.  Get the comb set for clipping various lengths.  The small tube of clipper oil that is supplied in-the-box with the clipper lasts a long time, so there is no need to purchase a 4 ounce bottle of clipper oil until later.</li>
    <li> These clippers get so hot I literally had to take a break on my hair cuts, because of the metal housing it&#x27;s hard to continue cuts when it heats up. The chattering sound of these clippers are a bit loud for my liking even after several attempts to make adjustments to the outside adjustment screw and the inside one, I even removed the blades and adjusted the lever. For some strange reason the power seems to fluctuate, at one moment it cuts strong then all of a sudden the blade completely stops cutting. They cut clean and I love that you can hear the blade cutting the hair which for me helps in knowing if I a cutting too much or too little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note I am not a barber but even I know that this is not normal for them to get this hot and make this much noise. I will be contacting Andis in hopes to have something done about this, after all it&#x27;s not like these are twenty dollar clippers.</li>
    <li> great set of clippers</li>
    <li> I use it to cut my 4 year old&#x27;s hair because he hates the barber. Its a little heavy, but that&#x27;s expected for something that&#x27;s high quality.  Its semi-quiet, at least more than the $30 Wahl I bought previously.  Its also very precise and I don&#x27;t need to re-clip parts of his head over and over to ensure I got all the hair.</li>
    <li> Really great. These clippers come as listed, they run great, cut really good and do exactly what their made for. Exelect product.</li>
    <li> Cuts good! But mine were very noising intil i adjusted the fork that the blade connected to!.Still dont know how long there going to last.&lt;br /&gt;And i bought 2 and both are Noisiey!!!!!! You would think for over a hundred dollars they would be better quality.So if your not good with a screwdriver go with a different brand.</li>
    <li> love them but something happen and was making loud noise</li>
    <li> When looking for a machine that is precise and powerful I came across a lot of reviews of this machine and those reviews were right. This machine is perfect for fades and blowouts. A barber cannot be a barber without one of these.</li>
    <li> Clippers ran quiet enough that they didn&#x27;t wake my daughter during her nap. Never got hot. And gives a close shave on my face. Using these with the Nano combs and T-outliner I got a perfect cut .</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper as well as the 7 piece heads to go along with it in an attempt to save time and money from going to the barbers (I only shave my head the same length all around anyways). The shipping was pleasantly faster than expected, and upon opening the box I was greeted with a shiny, heavy, and sturdy-feeling metal clipper. My father insisted on giving me my first haircut with them, and as he began I asked him if they were actually working - they were so quiet, I thought they weren&#x27;t cutting the hair. But sure enough this monster ate through my fairly thick hair without a whisper of complaint, and by the time we were done 15 minutes later was only pleasantly warm. I am very pleased with my purchase, and have recieved at or beyond my expectations for this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing holding me back from giving it a perfect 5 stars are two trivial yet realistic details: the clipper does not come with a bag or box to be stored in, nor does it come with a brush to clean the hairs out when you are done (though it does come with a small tube of lube).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Nearly a year later, the motor or some other electrical component burned out. But after almost a year of use, I&#x27;d say I got my moneys worth out of it (when the barbers is at least 10-15 bucks a pop, and with this you can give yourself a cut every week if you want to, no charge).</li>
    <li> In a sentence: The Andis Improved Masters are all-around great, with only one minor shortcoming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said; they cut smooth and without too much noise. Adjusting them is easy, just turn a screw. The build is solid, and there are no parts to oil, other than the blades. I&#x27;ve used them on extremely thick hair, and cut through without any issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason they don&#x27;t have the full 5 star rating IMO, is that they do get warm after 20-30min. Having an aluminum casing, that amplifies the heat a bit. It&#x27;s never become an issue of discomfort, as they don&#x27;t burn my hands, but I would ideally love a cool running machine.</li>
    <li> If you are a barber and have multipule customers at one time....  then these clippers are not for you.  The body gets very hot.  I contacted Andis and they do not make a cover for the clipper to protect your hand and the customer.  (Like the Wahl clipper covers).  I do not use these clippers anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do cut beautifully though...</li>
    <li> These clippers cut so close that anything closer you would have to Bic your head. This is my second set of Masters, I purchased a set about 12 yrs ago and it worked fine until i set it on the sink edge and they fell and busted the adjuster but I continued to use them for a year after that but just got tired of adjusting them manually  so i purchased the exact same model and will have these for longer.  I will probably continue to use the old masters on the dog......</li>
    <li> Powerful and heavy! Still getting used to it. But definitely for the professional</li>
    <li> Everything works fine, but when my hair was a few inches long I was having a huge issue with the clipper getting caught in my hair and tugging it. It was really painful. It works fine for close cuts..it gives you a great quality cut, but I would never use this for hair that&#x27;s over two inches unless I&#x27;m asking for a death wish.</li>
    <li> I use this one for my personal use.  I was looking for a quality clipper, since I have had Remington and others, which end having trouble loosing strength/power to make the cut.  This one is great, easy to clean and maintain, and very reliable.  The only thing is that after some usage, I had to adjust the flat screw by the side.  I only had to do it once like after 2 months of use.  Other than that I have not had any problems with it at all.  Just keep it clean and lubricated and you will be happy.</li>
    <li> I am a stylist.  I have used the Master Clipper for years.  I love the weightyness of it.  I feel like I give the cleanest clipper cuts.  Very powerful.  Very professional.  They last forever.  The last pair I had I had to replace because a little boy pulled them off my station and it hit just right to wreck them for good.  That pair had lasted 10 years and I know they had another 10 in them.  Can&#x27;t really go wrong with these.</li>
    <li> gee whiz who ever said this product was no good was either very weak or not very smart.  simple to use it is heavier than other clippers but, not by much.  the controls on the side of the clippers are also simple to use.  Overall a very good product made in america!</li>
    <li> If you have thought about cutting hair for your family and wonder which trimmer to buy, I can honestly say, \\&quot;look no further\\&quot;.  I strongly recommend that in addition to this item you purchase \\&quot;Andis Improved Master Clipper Model No. 01380 - 7 Combs\\&quot; or some other compatible attachments.  How well does it work?  This is how well:  Tonight I cut my 17 year old son&#x27;s hair.  My first haircut (of somebody else) ever.  He was brave and trusted me so I took the chance.  Bottom line:  He is very happy with the cut and there was not much yelling at all during the process (as you know, some yelling with teenagers should be expected).  I don&#x27;t write many product reviews but when something REALLY WORKS for me, I do.  There you go.  This is the one to buy.</li>
    <li> The Andis 01557 clipper is the best I have ever purchased. It replaced a Wahl designer model with a plastic case which became grimy over time. The Andis clipper&lt;br /&gt;runs cool and relatively quiet.</li>
    <li> Strong clippers that you will find yourself going to constantly. Great for fading, and fast at creating your blend. Also, a great shape for your hands (Wahl Senior&#x27;s feel odd in your hands)&lt;br /&gt;They can get warm, but have never ran that hot on me. Would have loved if they came with clips, but the clips for this clipper are not expensive. If the best barber use the Master&#x27;s as there go to clipper, that kinda speaks for itself. This is a win if you get these.</li>
    <li> Very good blades had for more that a year now and my hair has never looked better when I cut. As long as they are kept clean and you have some hair cutting skills you will get a barber finish every time along with some good liners</li>
    <li> so far this is the best clipper there is (according to my preference). I got the Wahl Senior&#x27;s as well but it wasn&#x27;t worth it like the andis masters! I recommend these clippers because it is specialized in fading and tapering! It does have some cons though. The machine gets hot after heavy use. It is also a heavy clipper which is not that bad either. Once again I recommend this clipper to anyone, best clipper so far!👍🏽</li>
    <li> This clipper is simply the best I have encountered. I have been cutting my own hair for 15 years and I have become quite good at it. This unit is  sharp and precise. It is very solid and durable, in fact the entire thing is metal and aluminum. The motor is unbelievably powerful and is about average noise production. You can really feel the quality of this product once you hold it in your hand. It is expensive but judging on the past few weeks I have owned it, it will last me a lifetime. True, you have to buy the comb attachments separately, but they too are good quality with metal latch, durable and accurate design. Only the lower quality clippers will come with the attachments for the average Suzy Housewife.</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my own hair for many years and have used Oster and Whal clippers.  I have had good results with these but as these clippers aged decided to upgrade and try the Andis Master.  There is a clear difference.  They are cut faster and cleaner they have a balanced feel in the hand.  They have marking on the adjusting lever so its easy to tell what length you are cutting.  The clipper combs are sold separately but are excellent.  These clippers are quiet, cool and attractive. Its especially important to keep the blades well oiled  because of their high speed. Be careful not to get oil on the metal body because it can become very slippery.  I am very happy with these clippers.</li>
    <li> I have own many clipper over the pass 25 years. These are the best for fades hands down, they have blade ajustment on side of clipper that don&#x27;t move as your cutting that fade!As for baldheads Oscars are the best on the market with #ooooo blade.. I plan a getting T-Trimmers they seem to be a good product as well..</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews prior to purchasing, I bought to cut my own hair, &amp;#34;bald fade&amp;#34; the negatives had me a little sceptical about the weight of the clipper and the heat that it produces. I got my clippers last week and they are the best set of clippers I&#x27;ve ever purchased and I have bought well over a dozen top brand clippers over the years. The clippers are a bit heavier than the others but NOWHERE near the exaggerated reviews. And I cut my entire head and fade and no issue with heat any more the the other brands. Theres also good videos on youtube for more detailed adjustments. Great clipper!</li>
    <li> The shavers heats up a lot.  What I do?</li>
    <li> Awesome clippers. Best ever</li>
    <li> These where my very first pair of andis masters. These clippers have very good built quality and cut very nice. I use these clippers mainly for fading. The only complaint I have is that they get very hot after 15 min of constant use. I bought these clippers for home use and still learning to cut hair.</li>
    <li> Ok Amazon what is going on? I ordered this clipper weeks ago, when I first got my order, the clippers blade assembly was crooked and had to return it and get it replaced. Now minutes after getting my second clipper back I find myself here writing you guys this: I got another bad clipper with a crooked blade assembly, it looks scratched, and part of the blade is kind of rusted/scratched, and the worst part is that I found several particles of cut hair, in other words you sent me something used! My brother had ordered 2 clippers from you guys before, and his were perfect compared to the ones I&#x27;ve received from you guys! I&#x27;m really thinking of getting my money back or hoping to get your attention with this comment and hoping you guys really check what you send before you send it. I&#x27;m hoping you guys promise me to send me a good NEW product if I was to return it and ask for a SECOND replacement of this item!</li>
    <li> If there is ONE clipper that a professional barber must have, especially if it&#x27;s a stand alone clipper, it is the Andis Improved Master clipper. It&#x27;s pretty much everything you could ask for in a clipper: Durable, powerful, precise, you name it! If I had to name a few downsides to this clipper, it would have to be the weight (which I personally don&#x27;t mind), the heat generated from constant use (the body is aluminum; personally, I&#x27;d rather stomach the heat if it means I have a strong housing that won&#x27;t break if dropped), and price (don&#x27;t get me wrong. It&#x27;s worth every penny, but there are better bangs for the buck out there for most people). I&#x27;d have to say that this clipper is best suited for professionals, or those wishing to become professionals, simply because consumers won&#x27;t use it to even a fraction of it&#x27;s potential. Consumers won&#x27;t cut the amount of heads or utilize it in ways this clipper was built for, and thus likely won&#x27;t find much of a difference between this clipper and a \\&quot;lesser\\&quot; professional model. There are lighter, less bulky, more convenient clippers that are better suited for people at home who cut their own hair or perhaps cut their children or even a few friends (wahl 5-star magic clip and andis speedmaster 2 come to mind). Of course, if you&#x27;d rather spend double the money than you really need to, be my guest. For the professional, this is practically a must-have. but of course, if you are a professional or are pursuing the endeavor of barbering, you probably know that. I highly recommend this clipper.</li>
    <li> best clipper out there</li>
    <li> I got these for a gift for my boyfriend who cuts or shapes his hair 2-3 times a week. He said they are the best clippers he has ever owned!!!</li>
    <li> I use these clippers professionally(Barber), these clippers are very effective for fading on the very bottom edge around the back of the neck, or fading in sideburns. Also very awesome when working the final touches on a high bald fade or whitewall. These clippers are fast cutting and very precise, better have a steady hand when using these.</li>
    <li> The Andis improved Masters are by far one of if not the best fading clippers on the market. There is not a barber on YouTube that does not own at least 1 Andis Masters clipper. I have 3 boys and I have cut there hair back to back and that takes about 90 minutes and the clippers were not hot. They got warm, but no way too hot to hold. I fade my hair from 000 to 1&#x27; and line it up (andis t-outliner)in 30 minutes and I am not a pro. I have only been cutting hair for my family for 8 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers are known to be relatively quiet compared to other clippers in the same category of magnetic driven motor clippers. More importantly if you follow the instructions that come in the box Andis teaches you how to adjust you clippers to quiet them and get the most power from them. I followed those directions and they run quiet and strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The metal housing looks great! It add a little weight but I have only found the weightiness of these clippers to be one of its attractive features and because it has brushed metal it creates a natural grip that is really nice. They are the real deal! Everything on these clippers are made to last and they are made in the US! Again, I have cut all 3 of my boys hair and mine back to back and i did not fatigue at all and I am no gym goer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall these clipper cut brilliantly and there are so many videos on youtube that will teach you how to fine tune these clippers. I love how smooth they cut. They leave you hair feeling as though they were cut by a professional with a scissor over comb cut. Its a velvety smooth finish. These clippers ROCK!</li>
    <li> I bought the andis master for non-professional use and its the best clipper I&#x27;ve ever owned. I researched many models before settling on this one and have no regrets. The motor just powers through the thickest of hair and motor heat has not been a problem at all. I highly suggest this clipper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Conair, Oster, Wahl, and other brands available in the U.S. Disliked all for one reason for another with respect to cats/dogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All did a decent job of actually shaving, but have one or more flaws IMO:&lt;br /&gt;- too noisy (even if a dog or cat is great about it, why add to their stress, KWIM)&lt;br /&gt;- the blade gets too hot, which means one has to use some funky \\&quot;cooling\\&quot; spray/oil containing heaven knows what ingredients vomit&lt;br /&gt;- unit itself gets too hot to hold comfortably in hand&lt;br /&gt;- blade gets dull too quickly (often blade costs almost as much as the cheapo new unit!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Andis clipper has turned out to be fantastic. It has none of the issues I mentioned above&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about it:&lt;br /&gt;* unit is very solid yet not too heavy&lt;br /&gt;* very quiet motor&lt;br /&gt;* blade cuts through even thick Persian fur like butter&lt;br /&gt;* blade never ever gets hot, and I mean even after 45-50 mins of continuous use, so don&#x27;t need to use any cooling oil&lt;br /&gt;* unit starts to feel a bit warm after 30 or so mins, but not hot and not to the point where I can&#x27;t hold it and work w it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only sorta negative I&#x27;d say is that to clean the unit, I have to unscrew the blade using a Phillips head and remove the little bits of fur that get wedged under the blade. But this is true for other brands as well, so I don&#x27;t know any way around it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Related to this issue though, is that there is an adjustment button for which one needs a flat-head screwdriver to turn. This is good and bad. Good b/c one can get it to where there is almost 0 sound to the motor i.e. very quiet, doesn&#x27;t freak out dogs and even cats. Bad that you need to have the 2nd screwdriver handy and after you screw the blade back in, have to adjust the speed/sound. Not a biggie, and worth the positives at least IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had mine for 3 yrs or so, and no signs of any problems at all. I haven&#x27;t had to replace the blade either, so I expect to use it for yrs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine gets a lotta use b/c not only do I clip my Persian rescue every 2.5 to 3 wks or so, I also groom a friend&#x27;s Maine Coon about once a mo. And 4 dogs (one is a Shih Tzu) every 3-4 wks all yr long. So the clipper gets a fair amt of use, and still humming along nicely.r /&gt;Mine gets a lotta use b/c not only do I clip my Persian rescue every 2.5 to 3 wks or so, I also groom a friend&#x27;s Maine Coon about once a mo.

    <li> Love this clippers... not the la clippers though....lol.. go spurs go</li>
    <li> High quality clippers. Better than spending 40 dollars for junk at walmart once a year. I figured they would cut a little closer but im going to buy the fade master blade and see how that works for me</li>
    <li> I recently bought these clippers but before I got to use them they did not come with attachments as suggested in the details of the clippers.  I wanted to return them because I no longer wanted them. They told me; \\&quot;Hi. How are you? As you know I have no control over the pricing of the manufacturer. You can contact the manufacturer and tell them but I doubt that they will add anything to the packaging since this item has been selling like this for many years. There are many accessories that you can purchase separately. Thank you\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are suggesting that I go back to the supplier and try to get the attachments. How about you don&#x27;t advertise they will come with the clippers. How about I don&#x27;t care, I just want to return the product. Make sure if you buy clippers they are not from \\&quot;Always Bargin.\\&quot; Poor customer service.</li>
    <li> cons- Little heavy, vibrate might hurt your hand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros- well built, works great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;comes with no attachments as stated. might need to buy some..</li>
    <li> Had to return it.  This is my third Andis Master Hair Clippers that I&#x27;ve owned and I&#x27;ve always been happy.  This one, was loud, didn&#x27;t cut well and dull, it pulled hair.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem before so I think it&#x27;s just one of those things.  Amazon was great accepting the return.</li>
    <li> Used for haircuts at home. Its is an excellent clipper, sharp and long-lasting. It hardly needs any maintenance other than brushing off hairs.</li>
    <li> I used these clippers last night and was pleased at how well they worked.</li>
    <li> Great clipper. Blade will cut any hair in its way. Gets a bit hot after a while of continuously being on. Is also on the heavier side. Shouldn&#x27;t be a problem unless you&#x27;re a wimp.</li>
    <li> i ordered from you guys before  ad couldnt have been more happy..i just ordered another buzzer from you guys because i dropped my other one broke the ballpin...this one came in the chrome plate for the front was bent and didnt fit flush and the balde length would not go to the first notch</li>
    <li> I had an issue with these awhile back, Andis payed for my shipping back to there company fixed them and sent them back to me.. Everything for free. Great company, great buy. I recommend and will always recommend Andis. Thanks again.</li>
    <li> It becomes unusable after 3 or 4 uses. Doesn&#x27;t even cut anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an experience barber...I should have listen to what many have already said is all I can say.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these clippers now for over 2 years and they still work great! Will be buying another if these ever go out.</li>
    <li> Clippers are very nice and very good at use...worth the money on Amazon where other places are higher in price...</li>
    <li> I bought these for personal use and they were great for the first 2 years(about 10 haircuts). The adjustment screw has vibrated itself loose several times, so I tightened it up each time. Now it has broke loose and i can see the problem. metal screw into plastic, never works. they are under warranty for the first year, but, like i said i only used mine about 5 times that first year. I called and they said &amp;#34;it is my choice what type of clippers to buy&amp;#34;. nice lawyer answer. I&#x27;m bummed they couldn&#x27;t work with me a little. So no more business for andis</li>
    <li> These clippers exceeded my expectations and i would recommend them to anyone that wants a high quality clipper.</li>
    <li> I purchased these Improved Masters about 2 months ago. I cut hair almost daily and use these as they are intended. I take very good care of them and always maintain them as suggested. I&#x27;m a clean, neat freak and my work shows this. They are very easy to use, the weight is different if you&#x27;re not used to professional products so that might take a little bit to get used to, they become pretty hot after about 45mins of use (almost to the point where you can&#x27;t hold them any longer), but they always run smooth and extremely quiet. The reason I give my review only 4 Stars is because of the experience I just had with them a day before. I was getting them oiled up and cleaned up so I could begin to cut hair when all of a sudden the blades stopped moving. I can still hear the motor humming but the blades do not move whatsoever. I called the service phone number, they were very helpful and are repairing them at no cost to me. Other than that small mishap, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase from Andis again. They are a great company with awesome customer service, making great products. These and all Andis products are highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Sending back! They were used and refurbished! They lasted through 2 1/2 haircuts before they quit!  The blade was crooked and you can&#x27;t keep it straight even when taken apart and tightened. Total waste of time and money!!!!! Do not buy these clippers!!!</li>
    <li> Great professional clippers. I noticed a big difference over the regular off the shelf variety from Wally World. Like other reviews stated, these do get hot after prolonged use. Not that big of a deal. However they have power to spare.</li>
    <li> this clipper is sweet. it is heavy duty for sure. actually its just plain heavy. lol. no its not that heavy i have seen a lot of reviews saying how heavy it is. i i cut my hair no problem with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; the other complaint i seen a lot is that it gets hot. well, i havent seen a quality clipper that doesnt get warm. i have fairly thick hair and if i use a cheap clipper on my head it will bind up, jam and break. the andis master clipper goes through my hair like a knife goes through hot butter. i seen reviews where people say they could no longer hold it after 30 minutes. i think it depends on how you hold it. i hold them down below the switch so i dont really notice the heat. if you grip it tightly up top by the blade adjustment lever it might be hot, but lower on the handle its not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i seen these in the store for 140.99$ a few days ago so for 83$ you cant lose.</li>
    <li> If you plan to use this at home to cut your own hair, you are treating yourself to a professionally used product that cuts 100s of heads per week in and out every day.  these are heavy duty as you can tell when you pick them up and will get warm if kept on after 20 minutes and too hot to handle after around 30 minutes.  Make sure to turn it off when you arent busy cutting hair with it and this will keep it cooler.  Also you need to get clipper attachments for these and make sure you get the full kit not the 7 attachments if you want all the 0 to 8 clipper adjustment heights.  These clippers are excellent for fading hair as well because it has 6 slight adjustments on the side you can adjust yourself for more precise lenghts.  You should be using this cut your family, friends, neighbors hair all day every day.</li>
    <li> As soon as I plugged them in they were deafeningly loud. Adjusting the screw as directed did nothing but add clatter and the cutting piece seemed to come loose. I took it apart and a cheap plastic part has clearly broken. It is a poor design to use a somewhat delicate plastic part to hold a high velocity cutting blade in place. Unfortunately I am past the return date and completely wasted my money on this item. Even if it were possible to have a free repair I would not want it back.</li>
    <li> if I could give 0 stars I would. I love buying from Amazon but i will never buy clippers from them again. I&#x27;ve bought 2 pairs of andis masters and one of them broke after a month (when turned on there isn&#x27;t enough power to keep the blade moving) and the other one didn&#x27;t even make it through the first hair cut.. I love the masters but I am just so dissapointed.</li>
    <li> This Clipper is Andis Co.&#x27;s marquee magnetic clipper, and one of their hallmark (if not &amp;#34;the&amp;#34;) hallmark clipper. While I still think the Wahl 5 Star Senior, and other Wahl models cut superior to the Andis Master, the Andis Master has a couple key advantages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advantages- Blade Opens to a true #1 (3/32 Ins.) and closes at 3x0, blade moves slower to allow for easier blends&lt;br /&gt;- Notches provide guide for blending.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting hair for almost 15 year. Self taught, with clipper purchased from a JCPenny catalog, it was time to step up my game. These are THE clippers to have if you fade hair or if you just want a quality cut.</li>
    <li> The clippers are really good, the only downside is that attachments don&#x27;t come with it.</li>
    <li> One of the oldest and still the best clippers ever made. These clippers cut from a 000-1 and fade every millimeter in between. It uses a powerful electromagnetic motor and cut at 14,000 strokes per minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade can be zero gapped down to a 0000 which blend seamlessly into detailers. Highly recommend this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;along with andis nano silver magnetic guards (two magnet version).</li>
    <li> I just started doing my own hair. Based on reviews, I purchased this professional clipper. So far, it is doing just what it is meant to do, giving me a quality cut, that I normally get from my barber. It does not overheat as some reviewers mentioned. I&#x27;ve used it non-stop for at least 20 minutes, the clipper stayed cool throughout the duration of that usage. I maintain and take good care of my equipments, so I hope this little machine will last for many years to come. Hey Andis, keep up the good work!</li>
    <li> Being a Soldier in the U.S. Army I needed to keep my hair within regulation.  I&#x27;ve been going to the barber and getting a high and tight haircut every other week for two years.  I decided to cut the cord with my barber and opted to buy a hair clipper and have my wife do it for me.  I looked a several brand and read reviews.  I decided to spend the extra and go for the Andis Improved Master.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got it, I felt the weight and it was hefty.  But the weight is a sign of good quality.  It is Made in the USA.  My wife uses it to cut my hair and she marvels at how easy it shears thru my hair.  The adjustable level takes my hair down to the skin.  It cuts clean and doesn&#x27;t pull or bog down. My wife has been using it on my hair for 11 months now and its still working like day one.  If you&#x27;re in the military, I highly recommend getting getting this model clipper.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for some clippers to use on myself as well as my regular customers so I have been checking out the reviews of various clippers. So I went with the Fademasters, the Phatmasters, and the Masters. The Masters are by far my favorite tool of the 3 to the point that I did my research and found out that all of the tools had the same motor but they just changed the casing and blade to have multiple products. I did not like the blade on the Phatmaster so i swapped it for the Master blade and I had myself 2 pairs of masters. I like how you can hear the actual hair cut as opposed to seeing it cut so you can attack the cut using multiple senses giving you an edge in fades and determining what length you would like to take the hair down to. However, I also use Oster products as well and they are superiorly powerful in juxtaposition of the Andis products. Your Andis produts will get hot and overheat if you&#x27;re not efficient with your cutting techniques and use them continuously for long periods of time. So I combat this by using multiple tools for different stages of the cut. I rarely have to deal with the problem of not having enough time before the clippers get hot. The Oster Fast feeds are almost the same product as the Andis masters, except for the superior pivot motor, yielding more volts and more power for cutting through wet and thick hair. So although the Masters are my favorite tool for their features, I can&#x27;t fully depend on them on their own, but they&#x27;re definitely a great asset for every barber to have. From a barber himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - March 19, 2013 Andis Masters are still going strong. With routine oil, cleaning, and servicing of your machines you&#x27;ll get your moneys worth hands down. These have easily become my favorite clipper to use, the main weapon in the arsenal because of it&#x27;s versatility to both cut even lengths, and fade into tapers, mohawks and most other multiple level styles you can think of. Great product!</li>
    <li> It gets so hot I couldn&#x27;t use it longer than a half hour. Cuts great but too hot to handle.</li>
    <li> Cuts beautifully, however,  upon  my third use it sounded sick. When I checked to see why I found that the screws were vibrating loose. Given a few more moments two of the screws would have been gone.</li>
    <li> Arrived and worked as expected. Good clippers. Wish Amazon hadn&#x27;t run out of stock on the magnetic guards</li>
    <li> Great item, and fast shipping Thanks</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as it should</li>
    <li> After two uses the bottom screw of the front plate came loose. This created a rattling noise and vibrations that forced the guards to come off. I can&#x27;t return the product so I left to buy a new clipper or risk loosing large chunks of hair if a guard comes loose.</li>
    <li> This clipper does a great job. Just know if it is &amp;#34;loud&amp;#34;...adjust the side screw a little at a time till the noise stops. There is a set of cutters to go with it that allows us to cut at different lenghts. This is a &amp;#34;back up&amp;#34; unit for us....we already have this and after many years of use wanted to have a backup in case we should ever need it and might be mid cut! This is a great buy!</li>
    <li> Clipper gets very very hot within 15 minutes of turning on.&lt;br /&gt;My hands were sore for 2 days after using this clipper.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this clipper unless you intend to cut hair wearing thick leather gloves.&lt;br /&gt;After returning the Andis Master Clipper I ordered the Oster Fast Feed and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Andis always delivers!</li>
    <li> Some of the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever used! Really top notch product if you are tired of cheap walmart brand bull crap</li>
    <li> My wife cuts my hair, and after wearing out our fifth pair of clippers and feeling like they were ripping my hairs out one by one instead of cutting them, we decided to invest in a solid pair of professional clippers. These are incredibly well made, I would say professional level, and they cut smooth like butter. I am not a professional so I cannot comment truthfully, but if you are like me and your wife cuts your hair and you don&#x27;t want the pain anymore, these will do just fine.</li>
    <li> First of all i need to address the negative reviews because i almost didnt buy..SO GLAD I DID! Anyway, the clipper doesn&#x27;t get hot unless you plan on using it for more than an hour and then its warm at best. Someone on here said they needed gloves to finish LOL. I broke them down and zero gaped with ease straight out of box no &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; inside either..brand new. As for the weight..umm if you cant hold these, theres a problem j/s. In conclusion i would recommend these over any other adjustable on the market HANDS DOWN. Photos soon to come.</li>
    <li> I have a pair that been using for about 6 years as a professional.  If you take proper care they will work perfect every time and last forever.  I need a new pair because I have been wrapping the cord too tight when I transport them a lesson learned.  I can do haircut after haircut with no problem.  They are a heavier clipper but very fast with a strong motor for professionals after a short time you get used to the weight.  All around best clippers for pros I look forward to my new pair!</li>
    <li> First bought the Phat Mster but discovered the curved blade does not accept guard combs so returned it for this one.  Well made, nd it feels balanced in te hand.  No problem with heating up.  I cut my own hair.  Magnetic guards real nice too.</li>
    <li> Had some issues with the voltage selector, but otherwise a great piece of gear.  Overall I recommend it.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of clippers in the past, and this is definitely top 3.</li>
    <li> It seems that the head has two screws that are too small to easily align the blades, hence the 3 stars. I ordered 3 of these and returned all of them due to misaligned heads. I figured, why would I want to waste my time aligning them.</li>
    <li> absolutely love these clippers; first off they were delivered 3 days early always a plus. They were what I expected from andis another good quality clipper.  I own about 9 pairs of clippers I just cut friends and family hair about 5 haircuts per week and so far these are the best clippers I have owned they cut very clean and precise. I would rate these clippers 4 out of 5 stars only because when u buy new clippers your supposed to run them in blade wash to remove the coating so they cut closer lol. I will  update my review after I do so just got so excited when they came in I just started cutting right away. btw I did zero gap my blades they cut great but I believe they can cut even better.</li>
    <li> I have cut my hair four times with these clippers. They are pretty solid clippers, but I guess I was expecting more for what I paid, as well as the brand name. The ones I had before were half the price and cut just as well. They were also from Andis. I love this brand. They do make amazing products. Adjusting them has not been an issue. I have also cut my son&#x27;s hair as well. They do have a good weight to them, but nothing I can&#x27;t handle for a lengthy time. I also have not experienced any heat issues with them. Overall, they are solid clippers so far.</li>
    <li> Great quality product, very accurate description (as far as being slightly heavy and getting warm) but nothing that disappoints. Would absolutely recommend to anyone. Used them to cut my sons hair and realized how much $$ I could have been saving!!!</li>
    <li> Works great.  Just like at the barber.</li>
    <li> Unless you enjoy adjusting your clipper every month to avoid rattling that scares the bejeebus out of your clients, don&#x27;t get this. Maybe it&#x27;s just for people who are really into clippers, but I have bought two and in less than a year they start rattling like crazy. I don&#x27;t have time to mess with and maintain clippers, and really I hardly use them. As a stylist just get Wahl.</li>
    <li> The first thing you&#x27;ll notice about this is the weight; it&#x27;s sturdy and worth the extra money. It&#x27;s relatively quiet and cuts hair without catching. The only con is that it comes with no guides, but a good set can be purchased for less than $20.</li>
    <li> I already own a pair of the 90th edition Andis Masters, which I bought second hand from someone, and I also bought a new Andis Master from amazon. Initially, when reading the reviews of people complaining that the clipper was too loud, I thought to myself, \\&quot;sure, they&#x27;ve never bought or used professional clippers so they are over reacting\\&quot;, or I thought they were fake reviews perhaps hired by a third party to bring down Andis&#x27; rating. Anyway, so I received these clippers I ended up getting a super \\&quot;loud\\&quot; clipper. Even after adjusting the power screw and oiling them, I could not get the loud noise to go away; you can only adjust it so much before the moving blade gets too loose and out of alignment from the stationary blade. It was much louder than the 90th edition I have, which are quiet as a mouse in comparison to the ones received, so much so that I ended up returning the clippers. In addition to this, the front faceplate seemed to be misaligned and there was a small gap between the faceplate and the actual aluminum housing, albeit a small gap, I could only imagine hair getting stuck there and filling up the gap with time. Anyway, the point is, I purchased new clippers and expected them to be ready for use out of the box, and I would be ok having to adjust the power screw slightly to fix any clattering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After re-reading all of the reviews, and seeing a variety of issues from out of the box alignment of the cutting blade to loud clippers that cannot be fixed by adjusting the power screw, I have come to the conclusion that Andis&#x27; quality control has decreased as of recent years. I owned a new pair of masters about 4-5 years back and they were find out of the box. I also purchased a new pair of outliners years back they were fine. I&#x27;ve since purchased 2 pair of Wahl seniors and they have been perfect out of the box. It&#x27;s a bit disappointing as I am all for products like these made in the produced and made in the U.S.A, which is why even more I&#x27;d expect good quality...sure you will defects in manufacturing, but that is why they and do the necessary checks to ensure they correct the issues before the leave the factory. There is no reason why Andis should be letting getting clippers get sent out from their factory without proper quality checks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final note on the actual product; the Andis Masters do work very well and cut good. They are as good as the Wahl Seniors only difference being that they are all metal and thus do heat up more, but the physical parts could probably hold up longer in the long run. Additionally, they open up wider than the Seniors, which could work well for blending, but in reality if you know how to use the Seniors correctly, you can blend and fade just as well.d quality...sure you will defects in manufacturing, but that is why they and do the necessary checks to ensure they correct the issues before the leave the factory.

    <li> I am currently working in Iraq and wanted to get a good, reliable set of hair clippers that I can use to maintain my bald head while here.  I have had enough with the cheap $15 clippers that break and don&#x27;t do a good job of cutting, so I splurged on these clippers which cost me $100.  I have been unable to use the clippers at all because they apparently need to be tuned or something.  They are incredibly loud, the blades are not centered on one another, and the blades swivel very easily.  I am by no means a professional barber so maybe I am missing something here, but for $100 I expect a piece of machinery that is ready to go right out of the box.  The instructions told me to tighten a screw on the side of the clippers if they were loud, but that does nothing.  I am going to have to send the clippers back home to my brother hoping that he can bring them to a barber for a tuning and return them to me.  Way too much hastle for what I paid.</li>
    <li> These are some very professional cutting clippers. Very impressed!!  Good buy and got delivered very fast. Andis has done it once again. Doesn&#x27;t come with any guards check out the magnetic guards by andis.</li>
    <li> .This product was ordered for home use. It meets all expectations as it replaces one of similar make that gave mor  than ten years of service.</li>
    <li> Best pair of clippers I&#x27;ve ever had. Im not a full-time barber, but I do cut quite a few friends and family members consistently. I mainly give fades. These clippers blend so good. Cuts down on time and really helps with the overall look. I bought these clippers after I dropped and broke another pair of clippers. The casing on these andis master is supposed to be indestructable. Hopefully, I wont have to find out but it looks the part. I would suggest these clippers to anyone...</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these clippers. Have used other clippers in the past but none like these. They cut very nice and smooth</li>
    <li> I used to use a straight razor for my head because I couldn&#x27;t find clippers to cut close enough. With the Andis Master clippers, I save a bunch by not paying for so many razors. Very tight cut and fast cut.</li>
    <li> Great clippers. I love how they cut. The only problem I had with them was they heat up pretty fast. Other than that it was a great purchase.</li>
    <li> I like it for the job wich is fading my hair. And also i use Andis product for 20 years already. Good stuff then.</li>
    <li> used it for a month, broke on me while using it. not sure why but it wont turn on anymore.</li>
    <li> For my Son and he was pleased</li>
    <li> I like the product;  however, there were no attachments; my poor puppy looks stupid on his head; it went all the way down to his skin on the highest setting.</li>
    <li> The best! This Andis Master has taken the place of my Andis Speedmaster 2, cuts are more crisp.  I don&#x27;t mind having the Speedmaster 2 as a backup, which is what it is now.  You can&#x27;t lose with the Andis Master!</li>
    <li> After 2 months I started hearing some weird sounds! it sounds like scratches or something! I don&#x27;t know what should i do!</li>
    <li> A gift for my brother. He really loves it uses it everyday for all types of cuts.  Durable doesnt heat up, professional</li>
    <li> love it. perfect for blending in those tight fades. nice n quiet motor. love! and it is very lightweight. thanks</li>
    <li> this clipper is for barber&#x27;s only only pro&#x27;s used this product .....great for fade&#x27;s taper&#x27;s have a good day.</li>
    <li> I have a beard and have used Norelco beard trimmers for 10+ years to keep it trimmed.  The design of those has gone from poor to terrible over the years and I decided it was time to invest in a professional quality trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used this for several months now, I&#x27;d say it is probably a bit overkill for beard trimming, but I&#x27;ll never have to worry about it getting bogged down.  The trimmer is remarkably hefty and solid feeling, bordering on just plain heavy.  The power switch engages with a solid \\&quot;clack\\&quot;, just like you hear at the barber.  The base unit has a lever for adjusting the depth of cut.  For beard trimming you&#x27;ll want to get the separate set of combs, as the base unit will do heavy stubble at the longest.  As I mentioned in my review of the combs, they aren&#x27;t great for beard trimming (too long and pointy).  I had to cut and sand the points off the comb I use for beard trimming to make it usable.  It would be nice to use the adjustment on the base unit in conjunction with the combs, but I&#x27;ve found that with the comb on the base unit adjustment always slides down to the lowest setting on its own.  Without the comb it seems to stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was somewhat hesitant to put the unit sans comb up to my skin for fine trimming given how powerful it is, but I haven&#x27;t had so much as a nick so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, using this for beard trimming is a bit of a do-it-yourself, maybe overkill, affair.  But you&#x27;ll never want for power or durability with this trimmer.</li>
    <li> did ALOT of research before purchasing these clippers.  i&#x27;ve now had them for about a year and a half and have NEVER had a problem with them and are still sharp and going strong.  they never get hot either.  very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I thought this Andis would have given me a cleaner shave, it works good otherwise, but should not be bought if you really want a very close shave</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t been cutting for 5-10 years these may be a bit out of your league. They do get warm after 25-30 minutes so again if your not experienced look elsewhere. Great clipper period!</li>
    <li> Love Andis Masters...always have...always will.</li>
    <li> As soon as i bought it, It madesuch a big noise. You can&#x27;t even cut hair.&lt;br /&gt;I tried adjusting it but it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> These clippers came in a box that seemed to be new. I opened and like others have stated, the clippers had been oiled and have some minor scratches from being put down. I didn&#x27;t spot any hair like some. I was a little upset over the scratches but the clippers work fine. I kept them due to the fact they cut hair like nothing I have owned before! Just those minor issues I feel people who order from here need to know. Also this is the old Andis...</li>
    <li> Gets hot after awhile but sure they all do. Heavy duty and has clipped a lot of hair! Working good still.</li>
    <li> Supposed to &amp;#34; run cool&amp;#34;.  Gets very hot. Also did not have the comb attachments!! Very important to have those. No papers to tell me where I can get attachmentsThere was no packing receipt or info on returns so I don&#x27;t know who to contact for returns  Also I was sent two clippers instead of one!!! I went to Amazon acct and can&#x27;t find record of the purchase to see which card I used or if I was charged for both. I called axon and was on hold for 30 min ang have up.  This is amazon prime!! Prime pain in the rear!</li>
    <li> This review is meant to enlighten the general public. These clippers are meant for professionals. They need to be set-up out of the box. Differing voltage will have an effect on how they run. If they were used a few times and don&#x27;t cut anymore, it&#x27;s because they weren&#x27;t setup properly. Professional barbers will know how to do this. Also, anymore than 20 minutes continuous is too long for any clipper. They will all get hot after too long. And no, they don&#x27;t come with attachments, A barber shouldn&#x27;t need them.</li>
    <li> I only used these once and they worked well. I did have to make my friend who is a barber adjust these because my clippers out the box made a heavy buzzing sound that was abnormal. I know other people with these clippers and they don&#x27;t normally make the buzzing sound. It cuts through hair like butter. I&#x27;m currently growing out my hair, so I haven&#x27;t touched these in a month or two.</li>
    <li> It does a wonderful job until it stops working several months later.  It&#x27;s also VERY loud.  Unless you enjoy using your garbage pail, I&#x27;s stay away from this one.</li>
    <li> Great clipper for self use i mean im not a professional barber at all i only do my self hair cuts and im loving this andis clipper so far i would recommend this 100% to some alse!</li>
    <li> Best clippers I have ever had.... I&#x27;m not a barber but these are great.. I hate writing reviews but ill do it to let the world know about these.</li>
    <li> Let me just say I used to hate and dog on andis and their master before I gave it a shot it is fantastic clipper but not for everyone it is heavy and it does get hot around 30 mins but if you have more then one its not really a problem I personally think the andis mlx experience master doesnt get as hot as these do but its your preference the best guards to use are the purple magnetic guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a tip for you newbies trying to buy these the regular , fade masters, or phat masters they are all the same clipper just different color or writing on the case so just buy the blades for the other masters they are interchangeable</li>
    <li> Really like this product for the price you cqnt beat it! Came brand new in the box and beeb working excellent since opened and started using!</li>
    <li> They are the best on the market, professional grade at a really good price. Lightweight and smooth on your hands, your hands will not go numb due to the vibration they put out; it is minimal.</li>
    <li> I had used a friend&#x27;s Master for the past couple years, and finally bought my own. They&#x27;re the best and I will never use anything else. Totally worth the money. Just be sure to take care of them (like any equipment you invest in).</li>
    <li> My workhorse clipper!  I actually own two of the masters but I purchased the &amp;#34;fade blade&amp;#34; for one.  Metal casing has survived many drops and travel to and from work when I bring my clippers home.  Great investment.  Andis and Oster make outstanding clippers.</li>
    <li> Awesome clippers! I can&#x27;t explain how close these can cut. All barbers should have these. My hair grows fast so I need to cut it at least once every two weeks. These do the job!</li>
    <li> Very quiet, light, easy to use. Does not get hot unless after long use. You will not get a bald fade as it is not a balding clipper. Guards are a snap to put on and off. Perfect clipper to do the horse work of cutting hair. Remember will not give a bald fade.</li>
    <li> Like the reviews before that I ignored as nitpicky, I completely agree that it is really too loud. If you adjust the power, it goes from full bore to a wimper ( doesn&#x27;t cut) with no happy medium. It cuts like every clipper though very overpriced at around ~$100. If I had to do it over again, I&#x27;d buy the Wahl 5 star seniors. With this set, you&#x27;re paying for aesthetics and shell durability but I can&#x27;t imagine you drop that often to be a factor.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive my clippers, but when they arrived the moving blade wasn&#x27;t level. I was unable to fix it myself, so they will have to be returned.</li>
    <li> Looks great, but a lil bit scratch on clippers surface.&lt;br /&gt;Nice fading the hair, but lii bit tight of adjustable blade lever.&lt;br /&gt;pimp shape outfit, but not the best.&lt;br /&gt;not easy clean and maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;not bad for trimming the hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper on may 27th 2013 and it broke on may 5th 2014 and suddenly it stopped working, even though i oiled it after every use (1 use every 2 weeks).&lt;br /&gt;- I opened the clipper, checked if it had some hair inside and it was clean, no oil excess either.&lt;br /&gt;- When i had it opened i turned it on, the moving part that was supposed to oscillate was static.&lt;br /&gt;The Clipper functioned very well overall but is not reliable in the terms of long life utility.&lt;br /&gt;So if you want a good clipper for 1 year this is the one to get.</li>
    <li> I spent well over 100 all together for the clippers and the guards.&lt;br /&gt;thought i had i great product until they broke after like the tenth use.&lt;br /&gt;Now they dont even cut and make a huge niose. Even tried adjusting them.&lt;br /&gt;*** Dont Buy****</li>
    <li> The andis improved master is a highly professional barber clipper that I&#x27;ve always been looking for because it gives that really great fade like appearance,and one thing that I like about it is it&#x27;s weight, only people who have this clipper know what it&#x27;s like to hold a real barber clipper I would defiantly recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> Purchased in August &#x27;13. It was fantastic - few, if any, complaints. Unfortunately the clipper completely died last week. No longer works. Will look to go with a different brand.</li>
    <li> Not as precise seems blade not sharp enough</li>
    <li> This is an excellent clipper when it comes to cutting, but for some reason the blade on this clipper develops rust within 2 weeks of use even when being serviced with the Andis Cool Care Spray after every cut.</li>
    <li> Great machine just heats up a little quick since its all metal. But overall very good for cutting long and short hair.</li>
    <li> i was pissed!!!! I used these  ONE time on a clipper cut and it got so hot I couldnt bare to hold in anymore, I called the company and wanted to return it and they would not do a return or exchange for me! not happy at all!!! I paid a lot for these clippers and just pretty much lost my money! I never bothered to use them again Ill just stick with my sterling 4</li>
    <li> Very durable and precise clipper! My favorite for blending. You can hear every strand on hair being cut and the notches on the lever really help in knowing where to adjust the lever. Great for someone just starting out!!! Only con is they can get hot after heavy use FYI for any begining barber.</li>
    <li> love the procut dose what it promised yes it cost more then other clippers but ur paying for quality thanks</li>
    <li> The first time I used the clippers, they broke.  I was able to immediately exchange the clippers for a new pair, with no hassles.  However, after receiving the new clippers, after just a couple of uses, the teeth started to fall out.  At this point, I was told the clippers were no longer eligible for return.  In my opinion, these clippers are a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Great clippers! Perfect fades!</li>
    <li> This product had poor results and resulting in multiple safety concerns, i found myself with a poor grade haircut and with multiple lacerations was returned!!!</li>
    <li> My husband loves these!!!!! Awesome price and great quality. He says he wouldn&#x27;t use anything else</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good pair of clippers to do fades.  I have been doing fades on my own head for the past 12 years and always used the cheopo wahls ones that you can buy at target, never had a problem with them.  I decided I wanted to get a professional type clipper so I got these.  I just used them an hour ago for the first time and here is what I have experienced, and this is MY PERSONAL OPINION so you can take it how you want to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) First, my biggest issue: The whole unit gets VERY VERY HOT, I mean to the point I cannot hold it anymore.  And only after about 45 minutes do you start to notice that the heat is getting bad, the blades themselves took longer to get very very hot but I literally used a glove to finish my haircut today because I could not hold it. The unit is metal.&lt;br /&gt;2.) Its noisy but all clippers are noisy, this is not a problem for me but still an observation.  Not a big deal&lt;br /&gt;3.) The clippers are very very difficult to keep a good grip on.  The casing is metal with no rubber grips or any other material to hold it easier.  Once you put a little oil on the blades, use the clippers for a while, eventually after switching the guides you will get some oil on your hands and once that oil gets onto the surface of the case, it feels like a bar of soap.  Not very good when you are trying to cut hair, one slip and you have a bald spot where it shouldnt be.&lt;br /&gt;4.)  These things are annoyingly heavy.  It is powerful so it has a heavy motor and I didnt think the weight would be a problem.  But seriously, after using for a few minutes my arm was getting very tired, much quicker than when I used the cheap ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the actual cutting of the clippers is just average, no different than my cheaper clippers that I bought for $20.  I am going to return these, not sure what I will get yet.  Maybe a different pair of andis but I will have to look at the reviews to see if any of these problems mentioned will also come with other andis clippers.er andis clippers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m purchasing this clipper again after 15 years of abuse to my original pair. I honestly believe the original pair would still be working had I fixed the cord. So if your cord happens to come apart right where it meets the clipper... FIX IT IMMEDIATELY! I ended up shorting out the motor. This is actually a common problem for the cord to come apart yet also a cheap and simple fix. A new cord costs $13. Even at $100 this is a steal for something that will service you likely longer than your car. As anyone knows these clippers tend to get hot after extended use. keep them lubricated and the blades oiled for maximum results and maximum cooling.</li>
    <li> This is the second fade master I have purchased. I have the same issue with them both. You have to fine tune the clippers as they make a lot of noise. It is suggested that you oil them and you may need to adjust them as well. I did both as instructed in a YouTube video put out by Andies.&lt;br /&gt;Both times after adjusting them it goes from loud to the blades not moving. I contacted Andies twice and no response to my emails. I would highly discourage anyone from buying these. If you are interested in getting frustrated, irretated, and ignored then these are the clippers and compnay for you.</li>
    <li> BEST CLIPPERS FOR CUTTING HAIR.</li>
    <li> I bought cheaper clippers in the drug store, and they were just inferior.  I came back to Andis to get professional performance and looks.</li>
    <li> Before I ordered the master clippers, I read reviews written by customers who had received used products. Thinking that the probability of me getting a bad product was pretty slim, I went ahead and ordered the Andis Master sold by Premier Beauty. When my clippers arrived, there was oil all over the clippers and the wrapping. I plugged the clippers in, cut them on and there was only noise. The cutting blade didn&#x27;t budge. After further inspection, I noticed that the blade was crooked. I removed the front plate and attempted to align the blade. The fork that the blade is attached to was bent. No matter how much a tried to adjust the blade, it just couldn&#x27;t be aligned. If you plan to order the masters, I suggest that you not buy from Premier Beauty as, not only will they sell you a used product as &#x27;new&#x27;, they will sell you a product that doesn&#x27;t even work (likely the same one&#x27;s that I&#x27;m sending back).</li>
    <li> These clippers are working great. I hope to get much use out of them.</li>
    <li> Slices through course hair like butter. Im an amateur and just upgraded from my beginner wahl color pro&#x27;s. I love these clippers and I give myself better fades now.</li>
    <li> Love these clippers, very good for all cutting styles, make sure you get the magnetic guards for these clippers.</li>
    <li> Best clippers I have ever owned.  I cut my own hair (bald fade) and these clippers do an excellent job.  They are quiet and precise.  I like the notch feature which helps you remember what setting you are on.  I see a lot of complaints about how heavy they are and how hot they get.  Here it is, if you have the strength of a fly, these will feel heavy to you...if you are a human, these are solid and well made and will feel perfect in your hand.  They only get warm, but not hot!  Unless of course you leave them on non stop for 45-60 min.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to have this it&#x27;s so light weight &amp; easy to work with</li>
    <li> The clippers were more than i expected.  They matched all information given in the given in the description. Thank You</li>
    <li> Bought this and it&#x27;s my favorite clipper.  I have bought others but none compare.  Will be using this to cut my hair for as long as I am blessed to keep my hair.</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair and used to use the Wahl Chrome Pro&#x27;s that I got from Walmart. They kept pulling my hair and I would have to go over certain areas a while to get stray hairs/lines out. I did some research and decided to give these bad boys a try and man do they not disappoint. I read a lot of reviews that say these cut your hair &amp;#34;like a hot knife through butter&amp;#34; and this is as true as it gets. No more pulling hair and or having to go over my hair numerous times for strays.&lt;br /&gt;They are a bit heavy, but it adds a legitimate professional feel to them. They do get hot after awhile (30m-45m) but that is nothing out of the ordinary if you leave clippers on for an extended amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend getting the purple Andis magnetic guards for the Masters because they go together like PB&amp;J.&lt;br /&gt;These are without a doubt top of the notch and most likely the last clippers I will ever buy (unless they break, then I will buy another one).</li>
    <li> I used clippers three times and the second time a loud vibration occurred, turned off and back on and it quit.  The third time the vibration begin again and now it won&#x27;t stop and clipper are unusable.</li>
    <li> Perfect,Pure Awesomeness, now I and my son can look fresh with all freshness..hahaha..so blessed with these.</li>
    <li> I  purchased this and saved a fortune compared to Sally s or any other beauty supply store. It&#x27;s been two years and it still works like new.</li>
    <li> I love it !!! they are very essential for my profession to get a precise hair cut!!!! The price is very affordable.</li>
    <li> The actual cut of the clippers are nice they do cut well ..that been said they do get too hot up to the point you can&#x27;t use them...you need to have extra clippers to do other stuff for instance I use this ones to taper fade...the classic 76 to leave longer hair</li>
    <li> Bought it for my husband who was using scissors, razor and another buzzer to trim his beard. He would constantly ask me if its even... Now, no more questions, he trims in less time and always a perfect trim. I love it because he now takes less time in the bathroom ;)</li>
    <li> Solid upgrade of the economical (cheap) Wahls. Good substitute for barber&#x27;s clippers.</li>
    <li> Clippers are well made, heavy-duty, powerful, and blade comes sharp from the box.  Wish it came with a couple extras.  Only comes with a small tube of lubricant and a manual.  No attachments or brushes to remove hair from clippers.</li>
    <li> I used to cut my own hair but I gave it up for about a year after my cheap clippers started snagging and pulling my hair. Going to a barber is nice, but it is also expensive and time-consuming, so I purchased these and started cutting my own hair again. I&#x27;m glad I did because these clippers are fantastic, night-and-day better than my old ones. They&#x27;re not the cheapest, but they paid for themselves after only 3-4 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades move extremely fast - 14,000 cutting strokes per minute - so it only takes one or two passes to get a perfectly smooth cut. This is something I didn&#x27;t even consider before purchasing these clippers, but it is faster and looks much cleaner than my old clippers did. Plus, these clippers look beautiful, feel nice in the hand, and are made in Wisconsin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased the large and small magnetic guide combs from Andis and they work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget that you can adjust the tension of the blades by turning the screw.</li>
    <li> High quality shears.  These are the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Gets hot after a while.</li>
    <li> These clippers are good however I will say that there blade will move during aggressive fading. The adjustment lever doesn&#x27;t hold well.</li>
    <li> Love these clippers!!!!</li>
    <li> They came on time and work perfectly</li>
    <li> Great product and seller.</li>
    <li> Bought this clipper to use in Nigeria. The voltage was 110 which wasn&#x27;t a problem because I had a step-down transformer. After Plugging the step--down, the clipper kept making this load noise and wouldn&#x27;t cut. I google tutorials on how to resolve these issues, but it still keep on making that loud noise. I contacted Andis and the suggested the seller sold a faulty product to me and suggested I return. It was already too late to return and would cost me a great deal of cash.</li>
    <li> The tool definitely makes a huge difference in how precise the hair is cut. These are the best clippers I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Only drawback is that they get really hot during a haircut after extended use. Besides that...PERFECTION!</li>
    <li> Same issue as others. Dead on arrival meaning the blade wouldn&#x27;t move. Another reviewer stated &amp;#34;there was only noise. The cutting blade didn&#x27;t budge. After further inspection, I noticed that the blade was crooked. I removed the front plate and attempted to align the blade. The fork that the blade is attached to was bent.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my EXACT same problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through a lot of different brands of clippers. These by far are the best I&#x27;ve had. no wonder ANDIS MASTERS have been around for about 100 years. Name another brand that&#x27;s been around that long? Reputation is everything!</li>
    <li> I was suckered into buying these at my local Sally Beauty supply store after I got a huge discount on them. Let me say that when there&#x27;s a huge discount on something, there&#x27;s a reason for it. I&#x27;ll keep this very short and to the point. I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for years and I used to use some average Oster clippers which did the job perfectly but they fell into the toilet and they short circuited (my fault). Because I couldn&#x27;t fix them, I opted to buy a new set of clippers, I chose the Andis Masters because I always use their outliner clippers which are solid. After I took these beasts home, after a couple uses I noticed something. These clippers got extremely HOT!! I mean so hot that I literally couldn&#x27;t hold them anymore unless I had an oven mitt or something. I&#x27;m not kidding. The second thing I noticed wrong with these was the fact that after a couple uses they all of a sudden get LOUD!! So loud that my roommates woke up and wanted to know what the hell was going on and where the noise was coming from. So loud that they scared me and made me mess up my fade and I had to cut myself bald!! In the instruction manual it states that you can make them more quiet by turning a power screw clockwise or counter clockwise but here&#x27;s the kicker. yes when you turn the screw to make them more quiet they lose power and don&#x27;t cut, when you turn the screw to give them power they get too loud and you don&#x27;t want to cut your hair because they&#x27;ll scare you. After tireless attempts at trying to fix the problem I gave up. Bottom line? DO NOT BUY THESE CLIPPERS!! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them to no one. Don&#x27;t believe me? look at all the rest of the one star reviews and you&#x27;ll see I&#x27;m telling the truth!</li>
    <li> after one month the thing is so loud i have to use ear plugs to use it. piece of crap I threw  it away</li>
    <li> Powerful and cuts well</li>
    <li> with andis you can never go wrong. quality and performance goes well with my profoil rechargeable shaver and t outliners</li>
    <li> When I first got this machine, I loved it. However after 2 months it started to make a really  loud buzzing sound, right after that it didn&#x27;t want to cut through my thick hair not even my sons thin hair!!!! What gives??? Really dissapointed in this product!!!! The only andis machine I&#x27;m buying is the t outliner. But for now I&#x27;m goin back to my wahl clippers I&#x27;ve had for 5 years now and still goin strong!!!</li>
    <li> These are great clippers, a lot of professional barbers use these.  A must have for serious barbers.  You will love them and your customers will also!</li>
    <li> I ordered these clippers as a gift for my husband.  The first order never came but I called Amazon and they reshipped my item overnight at no cost to me. Thank you amazon for the great customer service and for getting my item to me in time for Christmas. The clippers themselves came nicely packaged. They look nice and my husband says they cut great. Time will tell how these hold up but they feel sturdy and I don&#x27;t doubt that he&#x27;ll get a lot of use out of them.</li>
    <li> Took my barber career to new heights, I&#x27;m in Australia, the voltage is wrong so running a step down converter and works perfectly. Because of these clippers I&#x27;m now that dude. Do yourself, career and customers a favour. Put your name on some paper with these.</li>
    <li> I was looking very much forward to receiving this, and it worked like a charm for TWO weeks.  Then suddenly it started making a horrendous sound because the top adjustable part had loosened and, when I changed the lengths and turned the machine on, it wouldn&#x27;t lock in place.  The sound was so loud and the top so loose that it is essentially useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I excepted more than TWO weeks out of this product.  Mine may have been a bad apple, but I suggest you look for other options.</li>
    <li> Great clippers perfect for fading</li>
    <li> The noise the blade makes while cutting hair is amazing. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend switching from a Wahl Clipper to this. I&#x27;d stick to one only</li>
    <li> I received the Andis Master Hair Clipper yesterday and shipped it back to Amazon the same day after paying nearly $100. This item arrived with excessive amounts of oil, hair, and dandruff on the clippers. Really, Amazon? Buyer beware. The item states that it is shipped from and sold by Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers had scratches and dings on it badly. Besides that fact, the clippers are big and bulky for no reason; I didn&#x27;t like them, and currently I&#x27;m using $10 Wahl clippers with the different color attachments. Amazon probably did me a favor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After more research on Youtube, I opted for the Andis Speedmaster 2: a more beautiful clipper that seems to be half the size, for half the price, and probably just as good, if not better than these.</li>
    <li> I had a pair of these clippers for over 30 years and loved them. They finally wore out so naturally I replaced them with the new version of the same clipper. They don&#x27;t make things like they used to! While the clippers clip very well and adjust the clipping length easily, there is so much vibration, I&#x27;m surprised my horses don&#x27;t object to them. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had them less than a months and it feels like they r losing power while cutting the hair. Unfortunately I have already thrown away the box and don&#x27;t know what to do at this point.</li>
    <li> If you are a barber these clippers are a must have!  They cut fast,clean, and accurate.  Great for skin fades, low taper fades, and blow outs.  If you are in the market for a reliable clipper the andis master line is it!</li>
    <li> Already used this twice and the feel is sturdy quality, unlike my previous cutter. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Broke after three (3) uses, and neither Amazon nor Andis would give me a refund. Will never buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> my only complaint is thst its too heavy !!</li>
    <li> its worked kinda but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  NOise</li>
    <li> Love the Clippers, they get HOT after a while but I guess it comes with the territory. Never tried Oster to compare but I am totally satisfied with these.</li>
    <li> Strong motor and cuts very clean. Only problem it&#x27;s all Crome which gets hot after a while but they are great . Gonna get the fade masters soon . The price isn&#x27;t bad at all compared to retail or in stores . I recommend these.</li>
    <li> I loved these clippers when I first bought them, but after a few months and under ten uses they started giving me problems. They progressively got louder with each use until they were so loud I couldn&#x27;t use them around my children because they would be terrified of the noise. I have never had any issues with orders from Amazon before, but I am thoroughly disappointed.</li>
    <li> The MASTERS run smooth, cut clean and are very powerful. These clippers are great for all around hair cuts and fades. Good clipper for begginers and professionals.. Recommended clipper for all type of cuts and hair an the blades slice through like butter.. Clippers do get hot after a while so Andis cool care is a must to help cool down blades so client isn&#x27;t burned and so that the clippers don&#x27;t burn Ur hand holding.. Overall great clipper and easy flaw to fix</li>
    <li> I just got mine today and they are rediculously awesome. I used them right away to cut my son&#x27;s hair (fade). They worked 10 times better than my cheap whals. There is a definate difference.  They did get very hot and I actually have slight burns on my fingers.  I would have to say that its probably cus I&#x27;m not a pro and it takes a long time for me to achieve a tight fade.  It took me an hour (I know that&#x27;s sad, but the fade is tight) and the clippers started getting really hot after 30min of continuous use.  Most pros have 2 or 3 clippers they switch between as well. Like I said, I&#x27;m not a pro but they are worth the burns on my fingers lol.</li>
    <li> The product performs well. Cuts great. A bit heavier than what I was using prior but I got use to it quickly. I am still a rookie so the clippers do tend to get hot after about 35 - 45 minutes of use especially since the outer casing is metal. This probably happens with most professional clippers. The notches on the side are great. Now I can fade by knowing the last height adjustment of the blade. It came with a small tube of oil but I also ordered extra. The clipper guards are not included but those can easily be ordered at a low cost.</li>
    <li> Andis does it again. These are the only brand clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned and recently when I was in the market for a new set these were the ones everyone online were suggesting. I purchased the Andis Fade Master Blade to go with it and it all came together. They&#x27;re quiet, don&#x27;t really get too hot and cut perfectly. I&#x27;m not the best at cutting hair but these definitely make you look like a pro.</li>
    <li> Great product, I ended up dropping them and now the guard actually pushes back over the blades, pretty dangerous. Another note is the arm to expand and retract the guard does not stay put without tape!</li>
    <li> Short &amp; Simple&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a professional barber but these are A1 clippers. I cut my own hair and these clippers get the job done at a quality and precise rate. It&#x27;s a reason why you see these in your local barbershop. Add the Magnetic Guards with these and you&#x27;re all set to go. Some may complain that they are heavy but the build quality is great and they will last you a very long time.</li>
    <li> These clippers are greater than the average set of clippers, they are well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if the clippers are actually bad, but from where I purchased (hairproducts.com) the product was garbage. It makes more noise than a tractor and is very very heavy. For self users I would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> One word. Awesome!!!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the clippers my barber uses on me and I love it for cleaning up my cuts after a week or so.  Highly recommend this product.  Don&#x27;t let the word professional throw you!  Great clippers to add to the collection.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, I like it</li>
    <li> So yeah after getting these i cut my hair and felt like a pro. I have been cutting my hair for like 3 months now with many different clippers these were the bomb..I use to have waves in high school..and for some reason they came back yesterday..make a brother feel proud..YO so cop these clippers and get it in homey!</li>
    <li> Great clipper don&#x27;t listen to those other bad reviews. I would write a review but I&#x27;m too lazy right now. Instead go to YouTube and type in andis masters review xmunoztv47 and my review will pop up.</li>
    <li> Every barbershop you go has the Andis Masters on deck. A must have clipper. For everyone that is complaining on how hot it gets, is being a straight up B****, I literally cut up different people right when I opened these out of the box for 2 hours straight!! They got warm eventually, but not HOT where you can&#x27;t hold them or burn your hand...With that said mine were not LOUD, like other reviews complained...and if they are there&#x27;s a SIMPLE way to adjust them (provided in instruction manual or on youtube)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are awesome and seem like they will last for a long, long while.&lt;br /&gt;Retail: $140&lt;br /&gt;Amazon Price: Under $80</li>
    <li> The shipment process was what i expected,  I knew this would be a good product to purchase and was excited when i received it.</li>
    <li> Wow, this clipper is excellent and a must-have for all barbers. It came faster than expected! Ignore all the bad comments. Adjusting is very simple because all you have to do is follow directions! Love ittttt. It doesn&#x27;t come with guards so you can purchase them at your local sallys for 18 bucks.</li>
    <li> As I stated in a different review, the only difference between this model and the fademasters is the top guide.  It&#x27;s thicker on this model, which is prolly meant to be used daily and with the guide combs. If you want to save some money, you can buy whichever has the lowest price and just the top guide of the other.  Switching them out will get old quick due to the time involved with getting the right adjustments.  I bought both cuz the convenience of switching clippers is worth it.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s really good clipper, the only problem is the noise and the idea of dealing with it. But, it&#x27;s not something really serious! like it :).</li>
    <li> For those looking for good clipper stop here because they are the best by far... I been learning to do fades and tapers with these Improved master clippers and been very satisfied with them. Haven&#x27;t had any problems with them yet and I had them for about a year. The only negative about them is they do get warm but after oiling them right after every cut or every other cut they begin to ware in. like I said i have been learning with them but i just did one of my first tapers a couple weeks ago and took me over an hour straight and i only use these ones because i dont have any other ones(I know that&#x27;s a lil long but like i said 1st time doing a taper) it was wsrm but not to hot where i couldn&#x27;t stand to touch them. You go to any barbershop and at least one barber will have these clippers and who else better to ask then someone who uses them everyday. like i said no complaints other than their warmness but after awhile it really don&#x27;t bother me at all because they ware in. I also recommend the andis Edjer T-outliners. i use those they are zero gapped. which is close like using a razor.</li>
    <li> Add these to your cart and checkout.  Now.  You cannot go wrong with this shiny metal-cased classic!  I bought these several years back and haven&#x27;t paid for a haircut since.  It&#x27;s funny to think that back then, the cost of two haircuts would have paid for these.  If this clipper can stand up to the abuse of your local barber, it can handle anything that you are going to throw at it.  Super easy to adjust.  Guards and extra blades are always easy to find online and even at local suppliers.</li>
    <li> These clippers don&#x27;t cut evenly, over heat right away, not recommended if using for bald fades. I regret buying these you still have the chance to pass.</li>
    <li> I have heard great things about these clippers, how ever  the ones I purchased seem to not cut the hair even I have to go over and over the same spot, and the blade gets stuck at times when I do hair cuts, who knows ma y be I got the old version instead of the new and improved master clippers :-(</li>
    <li> Sturdy and heavy. The on/off switch is easy to trip and can be annoying sometimes.</li>
    <li> Better than the other 2 clippers I had purchased!  These work very nicely!</li>
    <li> I thought that the Andis master was cool and quiet.  Usually, when i cut hair it really starts to make lots of noise.  And after a  while of cutting hair it starts to get really hot and burn my fingers.</li>
    <li> I love my new clips works great with any hair type.  the adjustment nob is a little rough to move with one hand, but I wouldn&#x27;t go back to my other clippers if you paid me</li>
    <li> Awesome clippers. Gave to son and he finally had to adjust for the noise after his three years of using.</li>
    <li> GREAT CLIPPERS EASY TO USE, QUIET DELIVERED ON TIME QUIET, SMOOTH, SHARP, NO PROBLEMS BEEN IN USE TWO MONTHS AND MANY HEADS OF HAIR</li>
    <li> As a master Barber, these are the best clippers out there !! A must have in any barbers arsenal !!</li>
    <li> Stopped working a month after purchase.  Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I just started barber school. They gave us some oster clippers. They were not great. I borrowed the Andi&#x27;s masters from one of my classmates to try them out and they improved the haircut but 60% made a huge difference. They cut hair easily with one pass. You don&#x27;t need to keep going over the same spot over and over. These are awesome clippers.</li>
    <li> This review is not about the product, but the service/packaging by Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned a pair before. Due to my carelessness, they fell on the floor and were damaged. This was a replacement of those. When they arrived today, I was excited. When I opened the box I was less so. First, instead of having true protection over the blade and guard with a hardened rubber or plastic guard/protector, I get a cut piece of plastic bag over it. Wow.... that is REALLY protective. Then, as I take them under the light, I see that they have been pre-oiled. Now.... I&#x27;m not a pro barber, but I have purchase pro equipment before. When I say none of my previous purchases were pre-oiled, I mean NONE. Not the Whals, Andis or Oster. So, once I get over seeing oil over everything and some of it looking dirty, what is it that I see next?! The blade is crooked. That is a easy enough adjustment. Remove the guard and and adjust the blade. But, should a supposedly BRAND NEW pair of clippers need this sort of repair? My others didn&#x27;t. My next move is to remove the front plate from the clippers to see what little hairy surprises await me there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, these will be going back to Amazon. If I could advise anyone, it would be this. Amazon is a good place to shop and find bargains and I love bargains. There are inexpensive books, great deals on movies, nice electronics to buy. Go knock yourself out. However, when you need precision equipment, and believe me, hair clippers are precision equipment (don&#x27;t believe me? Let a hack cut your hair and tell me you don&#x27;t agree), do not use Amazon. Spend the extra to get what you want from a proper beauty supply store/chain where you can inspect the product before you leave the store and have relative certainty what you are buying is new.</li>
    <li> Good overall clipper cuts extremely well great for fades. If it didn&#x27;t vibrate as hard in the hand, get hot as fast and made the clipper alittle lighter in weight it would be better, worth the buy though.</li>
    <li> Very nice clippers.  Still going strong after a year of a lot of  use. The side lever really helps with fading hair, and getting that perfect length you want. Side lever also stays in place and doesn&#x27;t move at all when pressure is applied when cutting hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I liked this clipper so much I ordered a second one. Problem was that when it arrived the clipper was defective. The side lever didn&#x27;t work at all, and the clipper was not aligned whatsoever. Had to be returned back to amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get one that works you will love it, otherwise receiving defective clippers seems like a problem.</li>
    <li> Great cuts, but it does get hot after 15 minutes</li>
    <li> All I can say is that these clippers are &amp;#34;A&amp;#34; okay &amp; alright by me! Most definitely recommended for African-Americans &amp; Bi-racial people based on my observation of others using them and from my own personal experience!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for a few years now using cheaper Wahl clippers, I always had issues getting a decent fade... Well, not anymore. Upon opening the box, I immediately sat my 2 y/o down for a quick temp fade, then gave myself a quick cut. Simply put, these clippers are the best thing ever. Now, I get professional results every time. The only bad thing, they tend to run pretty warm once you&#x27;ve been cutting a while.</li>
    <li> I love this bad boy, it&#x27;s a true workhorse! I&#x27;ve been using the Andis Master for years and it never fails. I purchased this second one to replace one I lost while traveling.  I do about 4-5 hair cuts bi-weekly in my house and the clippers hold up just fine. Keep it oiled and clean and it will give you years of service.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews before I ordered these, and true to the reviews they didn&#x27;t seem to cut right at first. Then I adjusted them on the side and they worked PERFECTLY! I was also worried about them overheating, and since these appear to be made of metal I was sure they would; so I ordered some Andis Cool spray to see if that&#x27;ll help. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s the reason but they don&#x27;t get too hot at all. They get warm like other clippers do but nothing uncomfortable or extreme. I&#x27;m VERY happy with these!</li>
    <li> Sent me masters, NOT improved masters.&lt;br /&gt;Seems like I&#x27;m not the first person that this happened to.&lt;br /&gt;Deciding to keep it because I don&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of exchanging.</li>
    <li> Item is absolutely an amazing product to do any type of haircuts,shape ups and much more.The best thing it&#x27;s the beautiful color, craftsmanship, the quality and the performance.I chose this because the name brand has a good reputation.I would recommended to anyone that enjoys cuttig hair and wants to become a better barber.</li>
    <li> These arent terrible. I switch from my Osters, wahls and these depending on what kind of cut I am doing.  They are not my standard go to tool, but I like them for razor fades and hard to blend lines.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but when I was looking for a new machine I didn&#x27;t really see any reviews that helped me so here goes...&lt;br /&gt;This machine is GREAT!!! Works exactly as advertised! That being said I am someone who is learning to cut hair (fades, tapers, combovers, etc.) I am a &amp;#34;rookie&amp;#34; although the quality of the machine and the haircut  you get with it is FANTASTIC this machine cuts hair too quickly for me and if I make a mistake when making a line or erasing a line it is difficult for me to fix it. After four months I have gotten better and I have adjusted to the cutting speed of this machine. All in all this machine is great but not for someone who does not have experience like myself.</li>
    <li> this item is does not come with the guards. you have to spend another 10 - 15 bucks before you can start cutting hair. also if you cut your own hair, these clippers are NOT light weight. other than that, its awesome for doing fades.</li>
    <li> Great pair of clippers...</li>
    <li> Professional cut for a great price&lt;br /&gt;Strong reliable clipper</li>
    <li> As far as I know not the improved but very good clippers. They do feel heavy and do get hot compared to other clippers. However I do believe the heat is because I am not a professional and strictly use this clipper to cut my own hair at home which takes more time.  I have own several cheap thirty dollar clippers and I have to say the andis is worth every penny. Fades come out much much better and cleaner. Definitely recommend this clipper for begginer to professional. Oh and clipper balde was a little crooked but easy fix. Worked straight out the box</li>
    <li> I love these! They work great!</li>
    <li> Sturdy design but way too expensive. I&#x27;ve been a barber for 10 years.</li>
    <li> The Andis Master is really intended for Professional Barbers..if any regular person with little cutting experience tried these they may have a hard time learning how to use them.&lt;br /&gt;But if you know what your doing . These clipper is great for fading and doing tapers..These clipper was not made to cut a whole head with it becuase it does get Hot if used for a long time!&lt;br /&gt;it was made mostly for blending lines in fades and tapers.. Also Great for Clipper over comb.. It doesn&#x27;t comb with Guards ..have to buy them separate</li>
    <li> I have been cutting hair for 10+ years.  I thought Id get this clipper to replace my oster, which has stood the test of time. I bought this clipper and was overall pleased with the tool. Sharp, clean, precise and when you purchase the magnetic blades it did wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it all ended when the engine stopped after its 3rd use. Ive had clippers stop on me but that after years of wear and tear. I am not sold on this clippers quality in relation to its life span. I would buy another andis however not sure about this clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I already have an oster I need another clipper that does the same job but different feel (barbers may understand this). So I am in  the market for a Andis Phat Master Hair Clipper (01750). I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Started to make a REALLY LOUD noise all the sudden on the second haircut</li>
    <li> This item will get hot (very hot) after 5-10 minutes and also it pulls the hairs when cutting the short hairs. Yes, only pull short hairs. If you are considering to cut hairs for more than 1 people or can&#x27;t finish the job in 10 minutes, please buy something else.</li>
    <li> No good, the cutter was used and needed parts</li>
    <li> One of the finest and best clippers I ever had !!!</li>
    <li> High quality but gets hot pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> works awesome!! sharp define cuts!!!</li>
    <li> Thank you for e order I am so happy with tote product. It works great worth the cost. Nothing but good things to say about the service and product.</li>
    <li> I bought Andis Clippers a year ago. They are ok. I dont think they are worth the price. They cut fine, not huge difference though comparing it to cheaper clippers on the market. They are VERY HAVY, which makes it hard to use and enjoy it. Maybe they are better for a male.</li>
    <li> These clippers are fantastic! They cut cleanly, the blades are nice and sharp, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase. I use them daily in my salon and I might be in love with them.</li>
    <li> My husband got it and said its heavy and doesn&#x27;t get a close shave on his head.</li>
    <li> it made a terrible voice and did not cut</li>
    <li> Great professional product! Great quality and shipped fast!</li>
    <li> All around good machine. The lever is forgiving. Perfect for bald fades. Only thing it gets hot quick. Other than that its a good buy.</li>
    <li> These clippers broke writhin three months of professional salon use. They are loud as hell and I wish I could return them for a refund. Beware!</li>
    <li> Great price….great clippers!</li>
    <li> I got tired of paying $30 to trim my hair so I started buying clippers at the drugstore. The were junk. I finally looked at what hight end salons used. These are amazing and made in the USA to boot. Buy them.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Pretty heavy.</li>
    <li> This product is of high quality, just through its use you can tell. It does get a little warm but nothing that will keep you from completing your job. Oh and dont forget to order shave guards, they do not come with them, also there is a special type of guard made for this Andis model. Overall great product you wont be disappointed. Read the MANUAL before use, you might have to adjust it.</li>
    <li> Bought this product worked once since i used it. Tried it the second time and its making alot of noise and not cutting properly. Please help.</li>
    <li> I purchased these clippers twice. The first time they worked great for a few months and then the loud buzz of the clippers began. I tightened them over and over and over again. The clippers suffered from the contsant use of the screw on the side and I had to purchase another pair. These came with the loud buzz right out of the box. Once again i am adjusting the screw everytime I turn them on because it will not hold. I can not find the right amount to tighten these? I am tired of having to adjust this screw. I think I am going to move on to a different pair. Good luck...</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever used! Has the sweetest feed ever! You will not be disappointed with these. They are a little heavy but I like the weight. You can tell they are well made and it shows in the end results.</li>
    <li> Great clippers, but they don&#x27;t come with any attachments. So you can only cut 00, 0 and 1. You will need to buy separate attachments for anything else. These clippers are also heavier than any you&#x27;ve likely had before, so get ready for a wrist workout.</li>
    <li> Broke so fast do not buy stopped working</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m just a fan of the weight, the touch, and the precision of my cuts. some like the oyster, it makes haircuts look too assembly-line to me.</li>
    <li> Quality, quality and more quality! They feel great. The Mercedes Benz of clippers. Can get hot but not if you get busy and can cut!</li>
    <li> Nice Clippers, but run hot.</li>
    <li> My husband is very happy with them. The reason for the 2 stars? I did not receive the Improved masters that I ordered. I received the original masters. Im very unhappy, but he doesnt want to go through the trouble of sending it back, so we are keeping them.</li>
    <li> After buying new wet/dry cordless clippers every 10-14 months for the past 3-4 years I decided to splurge and get a professional grade clipper that would last. Seems that they will.  Plus it was 1/2 the price on Amazon vs the local brick and mortar stores.</li>
    <li> I worked as a pro barber in a barbershop before&lt;br /&gt;out of all the tools available to me it&#x27;s the best choice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good sharp cuts&lt;br /&gt;high powered motor&lt;br /&gt;durable steel housing&lt;br /&gt;last years&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is my second pair of masters and I can say it&#x27;s not really necessary to buy another one even after years of use just sharpen or replace the blade if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say these clippers aren&#x27;t for everyone&lt;br /&gt;as professional tools they require a good amount of maintenance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;regular oiling&lt;br /&gt;spray coolant while in use&lt;br /&gt;opening up to clean and remove hair build up inside&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this may not be the tool for you if you&#x27;re not cutting hair as often and or don&#x27;t see yourself keeping up with the maintenance routines...&lt;br /&gt;beginners might wanna try something like a Wahl Senior or another before getting into these...&lt;br /&gt;but trust these are the best on the market only a couple others match the performance</li>
    <li> Excellent clippers.  My only issue is that I want the closest shaver possible, and the screws on the clipper blades do not allow you to adjust the blades themselves, so that you get the closest shave possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On many clippers, you can loosen the screws, and then slide the blade forward so that both blades are flush with each other during cutting.  With this one, even at the closest setting, the blades do not get flush (the tips) with each other, so you can not get the closest possible shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from this issue, they really appear to be a quality clipper.  They did not get hot, and they were quiet.  I must admit that I would probably NOT do stainless if I had it to do over.  A hard plastic would make a better case than stainless, and it would be a little easier to grip.  It is not slippery, but I just don&#x27;t understand why they would go with a stainless steel housing for the clippers instead of the traditional plastic housing.</li>
    <li> awesome. we loved it.</li>
    <li> i cant believe how well these clippers cut hair. i would reccommend these to anyone. they are the best fading clippers i have ever used, or seen others use. they are used by professionals for a reason. great buy, and great price</li>
    <li> Im a stylist at a salon that does a lot of mens cuts. I needed something that could keep up. These work awesome but they can get warm after a lot of use.</li>
    <li> they work excellent for me</li>
    <li> Have them for about 3 years..got really hot after 10 min so I always rushed my fades.  Pretty sharp, I&#x27;ve knicked myself good a few times..also pulled my hair many times.  I&#x27;ve dropped them twice while in use and the teeth broke both times.  Not very durable.</li>
    <li> Not as quiet as I expected, gets a bit hot after 20 mins of use, but it&#x27;s precise and feels heavy duty</li>
    <li> Best machine on the market! It&#x27;s a bit pricey but its definitely worth it. Great for fading and tapering. I recommend buying the magnetic comb clips along with. They are heavier than most so I found u need to maintain a good grip but that only shows the quality so they should last a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using cheap Wahl clippers for a couple of years to cut my son&#x27;s hair that finally died, and was never wholly happy with the results or with the quality of the clip itself.  The Andis Masters are in a totally different realm to the cheap Wahls -- faster, quieter, better and more even clipping, and in combination with the purple magnetic combs capable of barbershop level clips by a relative amateur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided based on the happy results with doing my son&#x27;s hair to clip my own (fade, not just a short clip) and was able to cut my own by feel to a result that I was hugely happy with -- something I wouldn&#x27;t have risked with the Wahls, best on my difficulties in getting an even fade with them vs the Masters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These *definitely* run warmer than the Wahls, but they&#x27;re vastly more efficient so you&#x27;re spending less time clipping -- I&#x27;ve never found the heat to be an issue.  Overall, I&#x27;m obviously no professional but the dramatically superior results with these guys were certainly worth the cost of entry -- especially considering only a few cuts on my/my son&#x27;s hair will pay back the cost of entry.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> First I want to say I have been professionally cutting with these clippers for 3 years. They are AMAZING and in my opinion the best out there. You absolutely have to do some fine tuning fresh out of the package, but after that they are golden. That being said, the clippers I received in the order were in very poor shape. They were completely rusted on the inside as if they had been sitting in a warehouse for several years. The adjustable lever was also shoddy. I would recommend these clippers a thousand times over, but I would not recommend ordering them from here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had to return this product once after the first two weeks of owning it (I had to pay for the return shipping)... Two uses, a heavy/loud vibration began. Yes, recommended oiling/maintence completed. The item was returned by Andis approximately four weeks later and ran appropriately for about three months and the vibration came back. For the cost I expected MUCH more... I won&#x27;t bother returning it again it&#x27;s not worth the repeated cost of the shipping on top of what the product cost initially. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Simple, after my first order these worked once they were so loud and would not clattering. I sent them back and received a second pair, the same thing was happening so I called customer services and they would not tell me anything because I bought them from Amazon.  Product is a bust!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m changing my address and will send it back for my money. Blade not moving to even cut hair.</li>
    <li> A work of art. Hats off to the Andis Company.</li>
    <li> I would like to say that these are some great clippers. I have heard from other sources, that they get really hot from using them for a period of time. Out of curiosity I wanted to see for myself, and I didn&#x27;t see where they get really hot. They cut great and they don&#x27;t get really hot like other sources say. They does everything what it suppose to do and then some. I highly recommend this machine to anyone that cuts hair.</li>
    <li> Have had to take these clippers in for multiple repairs since I&#x27;ve received them. I have returned them to the manufacturer for a complete replacement and don&#x27;t plan on ordering barbering tools off the internet again</li>
    <li> I was hoping the name brand would give me a piece of mine, wrong. This thing makes the same LOUD ringing noise on my ears when using it. To make things worst, the metal casing turns real hot and burn my hand.........a hundred Dollar wasted</li>
    <li> The clippers are professional as it gets.  Very sleek and has a high power motor to mow down the toughest hair.  BEWARE!  The adjusting handle on the clippers may be loose fresh out the box.  There&#x27;s no way to tighten it so for me I pretty much wasted money.  But if you can look over not being able to keep it adjusted they&#x27;re great clippers with a guide on it.</li>
    <li> Machine is loud and clunky</li>
    <li> I inherited an original Andis Master Clipper from my father who was a barber for about 60 years.  He bought that original in the early 1960&#x27;s.  He taught me how to cut hair and I worked in his shop when I was a teenager.  I used that same clipper when I was a kid.  I ended up going to college, getting a degree and going to work in industry.  The barbering skill, however, stuck and I cut my son&#x27;s hair from the time he was 18 months old until he hit 28 and decided I was too slow-- which I was-- only practiced cutting hair once a month and on him.  I&#x27;ve been using that old Master to trim my beard.  It went to buzzing until I couldn&#x27;t adjust it any more and then it simply quit.  Parts and/or repair were no longer available so I bought this new &amp;#34;Improved&amp;#34; model.  It&#x27;s fine but you can tell that the parts are not built like the old one.  They used different metal in the case and the blade adjustment was a much, much finer mechanism in the old model compared to the new model.  The old one also had two speeds where the new one only has one.  In the old model, the power cord was fully removeable.  The power cord in the new one is fixed.  I don&#x27;t expect that anyone will get 40 years worth of service out one of the new models, but it cuts just as good as the old one.  Amazon sells it at a good discount so I think it was a worthwhile purchase for me.</li>
    <li> Very good but you have to buy the attachments separately. Ab addition in cost of about $10.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure that the ones you get are compatible with your machine. This is compatible: &amp;#34;Andis Professional 7 PC Attachment Combs Guides Set Fades Clippers Master #01380 &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had three clippers: two cheap ones, and Andis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clipper has a motor so powerful that won&#x27;t even budge at any hair length. I also like that it has many fade levels which can be selected with the lever on the left. However the blade does get really really hot after a while and you have to turn it off and let it cool off or it&#x27;ll burn your head or face if you are not using any combs. The clipper body itself also gets hot, but it&#x27;s not a burn your hands hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing, if your clipper starts to make a loud buzzing sound simply re-adjust the power screw on the right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing, stop using cheap clippers you REALLY can tell the difference between those and this one.</li>
    <li> Way to bulky and hate the way it cuts. Oster Fast Feed is much better</li>
    <li> What is there to say about this clipper that hasn&#x27;t already been said. It&#x27;s sleek, quiet, strong, and sharp when adjusted right. They price you pay on Amazon is amazing compared to what they go for at Sallys or other beauty supplies.</li>
    <li> Very di&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sappointed with clipper. First bad experience with Amazon. Product did not work at all when I received it. Blade not centered</li>
    <li> These clippers are solid, stay sharp and are built to last a while. The purple magnetic Andis guards are perfect with these as well, the best setup I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
    <li> Awesome set of hair clippers!  Every barber should have the Masters.</li>
    <li> it was for my husband and his old one rusted from not being used so I got him a new one way cheaper than sallys.</li>
    <li> Does not seem to function with power to cut hair quickly and precise for quick service and they are louder than they should be</li>
    <li> Been using these Master&#x27;s at home to fade my own hair and it does the job well. I&#x27;m not a barber just rather cut my hair myself. These feel good in your hand although a little heavy. They are heavy-duty and well construted. I also own a pair of Wahl Senior&#x27;s. I find it easier to fade with the Wahls since they are lighter so I have better control when doing my own hair. If I cut somebody else&#x27;s hair then I tend to use both. The Senior&#x27;s have a thinner blade therefore making it easier to get rid of the lines when performing a shave fade. Fade Master&#x27;s would do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the Master&#x27;s are great and recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> My instructor said, &amp;#34;only masters use masters&amp;#34;. The andis master is the hybird of clippers when I first turned it on the class asked me &amp;#34;is it on, why it so quiet?&amp;#34; In their Bahamian dialect. The master cuts with precision and gives you the cleaness job of any other clipper. My instructor and I recommended this product to the whole class.</li>
    <li> So many reviews!&lt;br /&gt;..sheeeeeeeeesh..&lt;br /&gt;If you wanna be cheap?&lt;br /&gt;Buy the master off eBay!&lt;br /&gt;You can get it for&lt;br /&gt;lesss.. then $45 complete shipped or a couple bucks more&lt;br /&gt;along with new blade Nd optional; back screws&lt;br /&gt;with your decision&lt;br /&gt;of these interchangeable blades&lt;br /&gt;fademaster blade&lt;br /&gt;Phatmaster blade&lt;br /&gt;or your standard triple zero blade.&lt;br /&gt;All masters got the same body..&lt;br /&gt;Your fundings</li>
    <li> I AM a professional, and I come from a family of barbers.... Literally my dad, mom, brothers, uncles... We all use these to clipper over comb, beards, fades, fros, and me personally i use them to fade my designs. IF YOU KNOW HOW TO USE THEM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you cut your own kids hair, slapping a guard on your kids head and calling it good is still going to look unclean, but these are better then any Walmart brand clipper. THESE CLIPPERS DO GET HOT, ONLY IF YOU ARE SLOW AND OR. ROOKIE AT CUTTING HAIR.  I use these for 5-10 min per haircut I cut about 15-30 people&#x27;s heads a day, they do not get warm with the use that I do. If your sitting in the mirror for 35 mins cutting your own hair, then yes don&#x27;t get these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hands down these are some of the best out there for barbers who can clipper over comb, and freehand fades, correcting lines mistakes and adding polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEARDS- for personal use, if you have the extra cash it&#x27;s a must have to take it off fast and efficiently with no pulling or clogging.&lt;br /&gt;For professional use, these are a must have for freehanding beards, fros, flat tops, fades, and designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE!!!!!! If they make a horridly loud buzzing noise, there is a flathead screw on the side that you want to tighten ONLY JUST ENOUGH TO GET RID OF THE SOUND! Over tightening results in lack of movement in the blades and you will find clogging much more frequent even to the point of the blades stopping all together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KEEP BLADES OILED REGULARLY. In my professional use, I usually oil them about every 3-5 haircuts. I hope you found this review helpful.</li>
    <li> if you can find replacement clipper attachments, its definitely worth it... it pays for itself after like 3 uses.. .</li>
    <li> I have been cutting hair for about 18 years and these clippers are the best.  Only someone who is well experience can really appreciate a well built machine.  If you want precision cuts, these clippers are a must.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product. Does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I love andis master, I do my own hair...great clippers</li>
    <li> One of the best clippers out on the market besides the wahl sterling reflection</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to start off by saying I am a student at a barber college, but have been cutting hair for many years and have a deep family history of barbering.  I started off using standard Wahl Senior Clippers, Andis T-Outliners, and Oster 76ers.  I decided after a while to purchase these Improved Master clippers because of all the great reviews and referrals I&#x27;ve heard about them.  I&#x27;ve ever tried a friend&#x27;s and loved the way they cut (especially when doing fades and designer cuts).  WELL, when I first received the clippers, they were in terrible need of an adjustment (moving blade was about 45 degree angle offset, would have scarred someone if I would have used them) so I adjusted them.  I spent about 50 dollars on sets of guards looking for ones that actually fit, and when I did find ones that actually fit, every time I would take them off the still blade would completely come out of place.  Very annoying considering I&#x27;ve owned a pair of Seniors (several years, basic standard haircutting clippers for barbers) and never had any issues with them.  If you are looking for a good pair of clippers especially if you are professional or are a student barber, I would say stick with Wahl Senior clippers because these are more of a hassle than they are worth.  I could have just received a defective pair, when these actually work properly with no issues I would say they are the best all-around haircutting clippers but too many issues right out of the box and too much money spent for this bull.</li>
    <li> A great tool for a barber professional, but it can&#x27;t be the only clipper in the arsenal. First off, this thing gets hot, real hot. But the Andis is a must have because the Andis Nano Magnetic Guards works with it and it blends lines so well. I really like the power switch style and adjustment marks.</li>
    <li> These are the best !!! These are the best clippers I ever bought and will be the last, they are  smooth as butter while cutting. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Also get the Andis Nano silver  magnetic comb set to go with this.</li>
    <li> Great clippers, used by most barbers.</li>
    <li> Great clippers, purchased for my mom who is a barber. ..she loves them!</li>
    <li> I have only used it a few times.  It started making a high pitched noise and vibrating.  I can&#x27;t get it to stop.  It is so loud that it makes it impossible to use.  This product was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> i would put 5 stars but it gets way to hot to hold to fast.other than that best clipper i have owned</li>
    <li> I bought the for my husband because he is a master barber.  He brangs about the clippers all the time.  I am goint to buy him an entire set.</li>
    <li> Had to adjust screw right of of box, but otherwise these are AMAZING!</li>
    <li> good quality works great no complaints on this product</li>
    <li> Best f*#$!n machine ever it&#x27;s awesome</li>
    <li> I like the way the masters cut its a nice clean cut&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dislike is that the clipper gets hot fast and is kind of heavy</li>
    <li> These are the clippers most, if not all, of my barbers use, as well as the clippers I see most other barbers use. Although I just use them to cut my hair to a single length (with the Nano-Silver Magnetic Comb Guards), they work well. The clippers aren&#x27;t as quiet as people make them out to be, but they are more quiet than most clippers. Seeing what these clippers can do makes me look forward to the day when I will attempt some fading, but for now they&#x27;re perfect for a basic cut.</li>
    <li> These clippers run circles around the ones that I bought from Wal-Mart. This product is worth every penny. They kept me from having to make a trip to the barbershop on multiple occasions.</li>
    <li> Great clippers. Best I&#x27;ve used so far.  Fades are so easy with these clippers. But guards are not included so make sure you buy those too</li>
    <li> Classic, excellent quality</li>
    <li> There is a loud noise from this clipper. Most of the time I cannot cut my hair with it and I have to use my old clipper. I&#x27;m even thinking about returning it</li>
    <li> These are my first clippers and they work like a beauty. I was skeptical because of all the overheating reviews I read. Yes, they do get warm, but not the way some exaggerated. It starts getting warm at about 12-15 mintues of cutting your hair.  I&#x27;m guessing the ones who have been cutting their hair for 25-35 minutes are the ones complaining unless they got a bad unit. these things snip right through my hair and I have Caribbean curly hair. It shouldn&#x27;t take you a half hour to cut your hair. If you want perfect to better results. Use andis magnetic comb guide, they help get the job done faster and effecient than free handing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy this was a gift to my grandson who  is becoming a barber. The Andis Master Hair Clipper was top of his list of to have clippers.&lt;br /&gt;I was also happy with the price therefore I purchase more than one pair and I&#x27;m thinking about buying another for my self.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work properly it pulled your hair and is not a good feeling I send it back to see if they can fix it...I hope they send it back much better...!!! This is the first-time I have a situation like this in amazon.....!!!</li>
    <li> broke so many times within the first week. Don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> I have bought the same clippers about 6-8 years ago, they are excellent clippers and perform really, really well. I guess things change and every company is cutting back (no pun intended) and tightening their belts, but when I bought these years ago they came with guards, a pair of scissors and a small clipper brush. These I received didn&#x27;t have anything with them but the clippers and a small thing of blade oil, WTF!!!  When I opened the box I thought that I had gotten a bad shipment, but the clippers are new and they cut real well and are going to be a great replacement for my old Andis pro masters, but what is a pair of clippers if they don&#x27;t include the necessary tools to help in cutting and tapering hair?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So great clippers but only 4 stars for not including the basic and needed hair guards.  I don&#x27;t know when they started doing this but it sucks.  Did anyone else notice this or do I need to return these and have them send me another pair?</li>
    <li> Great clippers from Andis. Give you that professional finish look. That&#x27;s what I was looking for and price better than SALLY.</li>
    <li> I am what you would call frugal.  I usually don&#x27;t like to spend over 20 dollars for clippers.  I finally decided I wanted to try something better than the Whals kits they sell at Wal-Mart to see if I could get a better cut.  I see the Andis Master being used by a lot of barbers so I decided to give them a try.  After the first stroke I noticed a better feel and smoother cut.  This product lived up to the hype for me.  The clippers are a bit heavier than some other clippers but it&#x27;s not like going to the gym for a workout or anything.  I took my time to use them the first time, so I held them for about 45 min or more.  I didn&#x27;t experience any muscle fatigue like others were complaining about (for those people an occasional push up will fix that).  The clippers did get a little warm but not hot (not even an irritating warm just noticeable).  The clippers getting hot may be a concern for those who cut hair professionally but not for a home barber like me. Even a cheap guy like me would recommend purchasing the Andis Master because it is well worth the money and provides a fresh from the barber&#x27;s chair cut.  Lastly, I don&#x27;t know if it matters or not but the description say Andis 01557 but they actually send 01556.  This may make a difference to you if you know if there is a difference between the two product numbers, but it did not make a difference to me (I don&#x27;t know if there is a difference and I don&#x27;t care).  The 01556 is the same product number that is sold in the beauty supply stores for much more money.</li>
    <li> Product is great! And the item got here very quickly. I Love the Andis clippers! Would recommend to anyone in need of hair clippers. It is well worth the money I paid.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery! Item just as described!</li>
    <li> Terrible. Missing parts, did not work.</li>
    <li> Amazing clippers.  Takes me a few minutes to shave, even when I&#x27;ve let my beard get to &amp;#34;wolfman&amp;#34; status.  Easy to clean, and the magnetic comb set works great with them.  Will never need another set of clippers!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned 3 different Andis Masters over the years and I&#x27;ve still to have one that works properly out of the box or that has stayed dialed in for any respectable time. Great when you get them set right but finicky and totally unreliable.</li>
    <li> This product is remarkably good cuts well the performance is amazing! Only down fall is that it gets really hot and because the body of the clipper is metal it conducts the heat from the motor and gets quite hot after 30mins of use</li>
    <li> I hate the inconvenience of  going to the barbershop and some of the nonsense that gets discussed there which is why I love my quality Andis products which enable me to do self barbering. There is a learning curve to it though so be patient for a little while and if you need some guidance there are plenty of videos on YouTube to show you the way.</li>
