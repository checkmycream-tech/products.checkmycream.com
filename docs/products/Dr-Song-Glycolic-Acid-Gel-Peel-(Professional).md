      <li>I just finished my last ten minute session and my skin feels great.</li>
      <li>After each session my skin felt very soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I use this along with the 2.5% benzoyl peroxide gel and it works pretty well.</li>
      <li>Exactly what it says on the tin.</li>
      <li>I have to say that this is my first experience using any glycolic peels.</li>
      <li>Before purchasing this I was using a 20% glycolic peel that I got from my sister that is an esthetician, and that burned..alot, but my skin felt so soft and smooth afterwards</li>
      <li>I used it first for spot treatments in problem areas, then as I got used to how my skin responded, I moved on to full-face applications.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the real deal too!</li>
      <li>The product works exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>you are interested in trying an at home peel</li>
      <li>Any positive help would be appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>for results, I probably should have done a before pic because I dont really notice anything.</li>
      <li>You save sooo much money doing it yourself.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t want to leave it on longer though so</li>
      <li>It works VERY well.</li>
      <li>I have used the product 3 times now, I really, really wanted to like it, but I don&#x27;t think I do.</li>
      <li>Refreshed skin, nice shine, strips the dead skin.</li>
      <li>They have other ingredients that makes for a more soothing application.</li>
      <li>I have paid a lot more for other branded versions.  </li>
      <li>Clean your face, no scrubs or exfoliating several days before you do a peel, apply the peel, wait 1 minute to 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Go over your face, then, with cool water if you need to, then lastly Moisturize!</li>
      <li>I bough Dr. song&#x27;s peeling for the first time and it works  just like a professional peeling a doctor will give me.</li>

      <li>I had no negative reactions to this product.</li>
      <li>Us older folks shed our skin slower than when we were young.</li>
      <li>My previous 30% glycolic was not quite as strong.</li>
      <li>It came with very clear instructions that I followed.</li>
      <li>Works well, my skin is also very soft.</li>
      <li>When you first get the product only keep it on for a a couple minutes once a week.</li>
      <li>It is professional quality!</li>
      <li>I was looking for a cheap alternative to my monthly  microdermabrasion and a less invasive chemical peel</li>
      <li>When you first put it on it starts to have a mild tingling sensation almost to the point of a faint burning sensation but that goes away quickly.</li>
      <li>Also, keep away from light--Most glycolic peels are sold in amber bottles to prevent exposure, but this is in a clear bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had professional glycolic peels</li>
      <li>I tried this peel and nothing happened as far as any peeling goes.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not really harsh on it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this and all Dr. Song products!!</li>
    <li> I have used it twice and it&#x27;s very gut not to strong for beginning</li>
    <li> I bough Dr. song&#x27;s peeling for the first time and it works  just like a professional peeling a doctor will give me.</li>
    <li> Quality Glycolic Acid! I love that I can save money on expensive salon peels, and &#x27;do it myself&#x27; at home!</li>
    <li> I have not tried other products for a comparison. With that said I will say my thoughts on this product if any men are curious.&lt;br /&gt;My wife suggested I try a peel because my skin as I age is getting thicker and with the type of work I do as a tradesmen, there are many pollutant in the air which made my skin dirty and ruff. I tried it for my first time and was very pleased. My wife said she could see a difference in my skin. It seemed thinner and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I waited a few weeks and did another peel and my skin complexion got better. My skin is lighter stripping off the dead skin. Us older folks shed our skin slower than when we were young. With this peel my face feels lighter and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must be careful using this if because it will burn if you apply too much, especially if you have thin skin. Aging men have thicker skin. My wife tried it and got a small burn spot on her cheek. She does her facials at the salon. They have other ingredients that makes for a more soothing application. For me I think this is a good price saver. It cost approximately $100 for a chemical peel at a salon and I did it for a few bucks. I will work my way up to the stronger strength in time. I am amazed what the glycolic peel has done for my skin. You look good, you feel good. 2 thumbs up on this product.</li>
    <li> Dr Song&#x27;s product works well on my pale and sensitive skin. It reduces wrinkles and gives a skin beautiful glow.</li>
    <li> Everything arrived on time and was nicely packaged. The product works exactly as advertised. The price is the best part of all.</li>
    <li> I feel that the product arrived on time, and I am excited about trying it!! It seems to be of good quality!!</li>
    <li> I ordered and received Dr Son 40% Glycolic Acid with no instructions. drsong.com is not a working website. The phone number doesn&#x27;t seem to be a working number either. I won&#x27;t use the product without proper instructions. For nearly a month it just sits on a shelf. Any positive help would be appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Doris Cook</li>
    <li> This works great for my skin.  Have been using it on a weekly basis and have seen improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> Powerful and effective gel!! Great price and fast shipping. I recommend this product, but please be aware that it is very potent. Be careful!</li>
    <li> I mix a few drops of this with my face wash every day.  I love this produce. Fades scars and freckles and zero blackheads and breakouts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and the stains on my face are fading.  My skin is smoother too, BONUS! I purchased the Post Peel ph Balancer, because I read on reviews for other products that it&#x27;s needed. I haven&#x27;t found that to be so with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve no experience with a face peel...this product is very subtle for me, when applied...It tingles and yet has not irritated my skin overall...On initial use, I had one very small area on my one cheek bone that reddened very briefly, for less than the day of use...I continue to use it weekly and realize that there is less tingling, and yet still some, with no further reddening to the one area I described...My skin is smoother, which is why I wanted to try this...for it had felt somewhat leathery to me, before using...Sooo, I can say I am satisfied with as much as I know thus far :) ...Blessings :)</li>
    <li> I got this acid peel at a great introductory price and it works very well. Will keep an eye on this brand.</li>
    <li> A good product at a discounted price. It is professional quality! Be careful not to leave on your face too long and follow the instructions that Austin sends you after you purchase this. You can also use baking soda to remove any possible sting from the glycolic acid and residue. I just leave this on for a short period of time. You will feel the sting, but it will not burn provided you remove it timely and follow the instructions.</li>
    <li> After 4 peels.. my acne is gone and I look younger. It works on my sensitive, acne prone, combination dry oily skin. This is going to stay on my beauty regimen. For those of you who wants to try it, just make sure you use a moisturizer with a good SPF every morning.</li>
    <li> I love it. My face tightened immediately after I did the peel. I use a thick oil on my face, Cactus Oil, and sleep in it after I do a peel so I don.t have that dry, crackling skin that is sloughing off each day. I do these every 2 weeks, for now..until I get my skin where I want it. I just started, this is my 1st do it at home myself peel. My 2nd application. I use to go to spas and pay $60 to $100.00 for these. You save sooo much money doing it yourself. I watched a ton of videos/tutorials on YouTube 1st of people doing peels at home. It.s easy. Clean your face, no scrubs or exfoliating several days before you do a peel, apply the peel, wait 1 minute to 5 minutes. Your 1st peel just do 1 minute. My 2nd peel I did 6 minutes..until it started stinging. Then Neutralize it, (buy the peel neutralizer or use baking soda and water..I bought the neutralizer.) Go over your face, then, with cool water if you need to, then lastly Moisturize! That.s it.</li>
    <li> In love after 2weeks!!!</li>
    <li> This product works. I&#x27;ve had professional glycolic peels so I knew the process and the length of time I could leave the product on. I&#x27;ll be saving a lot of money and use this product from now on!  Use on a regular base to see results.</li>
    <li> Followed all the instruction and still did not meet my expectation.</li>
    <li> This item is not very good doesn&#x27;t seems to be working fine as peel is not coming off after using this product.</li>
    <li> Great experience. Great product</li>
    <li> Excellent product! It works VERY well. My previous 30% glycolic was not quite as strong. This one is great. I especially like that it is unscented/no fragrance. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> It is too painfull to keep on my face for more than 3-4min. I&#x27;m a decent sized guy with a pretty tough face and i&#x27;m like a little school girl hopping around trying to keep it on for long enough. I am actually not sure if i&#x27;m using it right because it doesnt even make my skin red or anything even though it gets to the point where I cant take the pain anymore at the 3-4min mark and I RUSH to wash it off. Speaking of, its a weird pain too and unlike any types of pain ive felt before - Ive broken my tibia before and actually tried to &amp;#34;walk it off&amp;#34; because I didnt know it was broken, I only made it a half a step lol, so I wouldnt consider myself a wuss.....anyway, Ive only used it 3 times and - with how bad the pain is, I havent  applied it in about 2 months - and dont look forward to using it again, actually, &amp;#34;dread using it again&amp;#34; is more like it... lol.&lt;br /&gt;As for results, I probably should have done a before pic because I dont really notice anything.</li>
    <li> I liked the results so far. I have used the glycolic peel once and the hylorenic acid several times. I am trying to get rid of some marks on my skin. I have had no adverse reactions and I got the products quickly. I will keep using them.</li>
    <li> The delivery time was fine with but it came without instructions and I&#x27;m afraid to use it .</li>
    <li> This product worked wonders for my skin. I am african american DARK OILY skin. Used it once every 3 wks just about. did as it says if used properly will have no issues.</li>
    <li> i saw the diferrence on my skin!!! became more smooth and my marks started to fade. i used once a week. and it didnt burn my skin. 3 mins per session.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t received the product!,I would like know What happen because I buy that product 24 of september,so!,for the moment I am not so happy.Mr Miguel Diaz</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not doing anything. I started with a test, nothing happened so I used for 2 minutes the next time. Nothing. No heat, no peel, etc. Then I tried using more and longer for 6-7 minutes, still nothing. My skin felt a bit tight after the first time, but that hasn&#x27;t happened since. I really don&#x27;t want to leave it on longer though so not sure what to think. I&#x27;ve been using some other products but this still should be taking at least a bit of surface skin off. Maybe it&#x27;s old and lost it&#x27;s potency? Hard to recommend when I&#x27;m not getting any effect at all.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, I have only used 2 times but my skin already appears smoother. Though I have not needed to contact customer service, they have contacted me with directions on how to use the peel and to make sure I am satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I used it first for spot treatments in problem areas, then as I got used to how my skin responded, I moved on to full-face applications. I recommend taking your time, don&#x27;t just jump in and try to duplicate pro results! I am impressed, and will try some of the other products.</li>
    <li> great product my skin is very soft</li>
    <li> It burned my skin badlybso I gave it away to a friend of mine. Sorry but I guess its not for everyone.</li>
    <li> I have to say that this is my first experience using any glycolic peels. I have fair and sometimes sensitive skin. I had no negative reactions to this product. It came with very clear instructions that I followed. The product stung only mildly and was not bothersome. After each session my skin felt very soft and smooth. I just finished my last ten minute session and my skin feels great. I am going to give it a break now though, because I can see how people can become addicted to it and over use it. Your skin will be so smooth and have a lovely glow!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great. Leaves my skin feeling fresh and new. Haven&#x27;t used it enough to reverse the sun-damage I bought this for yet but I&#x27;ll update in a few weeks to see if it&#x27;ll work. It&#x27;s the real deal too!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used this peel a couple times already and i see a difference. it&#x27;s strong takes some getting used to but well worth it. i also use the Benzoyl peroxide 10% these products have made my skin clear and smooth, would definitely recommend these products</li>
    <li> I use this along with the 2.5% benzoyl peroxide gel and it works pretty well. I have really sensitive skin and it&#x27;s not really harsh on it. When you first put it on it starts to have a mild tingling sensation almost to the point of a faint burning sensation but that goes away quickly. When you first get the product only keep it on for a a couple minutes once a week. Increase as you get used to it. Overall not to bad.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cheap alternative to my monthly  microdermabrasion and a less invasive chemical peel and so I purchased this item as part of a promo for trying their teeth whitening system. Their teeth whitening system is GREAT, and I&#x27;ll save details of that in another review. For this item, I will have to say that I should have taken the advice of other reviewers. I have pretty thick skin and can handle pain pretty well, but the after effects of leaving this product on for about 10 mins was quite scary. Let&#x27;s just say I didn&#x27;t leave the home for a few days because it really &amp;#34;did it&#x27;s job.&amp;#34; I&#x27;d say only leave it on for less than 5 mins for your first round as it is quite an invasive product. However, I am happy with the results. My skin does&#x27;t look dull and helps eliminates minor acne scars. Healing process generally takes 2-3 days if you use it for 2-5 mins (which is what I recommend). I have been using the products on and off for about a year now. I generally use it when my skin is looking dull and I think it&#x27;s time for some pampering. Make sure you wash your face before and afterwards and pay attention to the clock. I like to wash off the treatment with a luke warm towel and then wash my face with some cleanser. Avoid using astringent and anything harsh for a few days. Keep this product away from children and pets, it&#x27;s strong stuff.</li>
    <li> Refreshed skin, nice shine, strips the dead skin. No burning but skin a little sensitive to retinol products.</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s a gel and it makes my skin feel so smooth. I&#x27;ve tried several different glycolic acid peels and this is one of the best.</li>
    <li> Results after just one use.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This makes my skin soft, but it also burns a little and makes my skin red.  However, I notice an improvement in the quality and clarity of my skin texture when I use it regularly (once a week is all you need).</li>
    <li> I have used the product 3 times now, I really, really wanted to like it, but I don&#x27;t think I do. There is zero burning or  tingling, I may as well have put some water on my face. Before purchasing this I was using a 20% glycolic peel that I got from my sister that is an esthetician, and that burned..alot, but my skin felt so soft and smooth afterwards, i figured after using the 20% glycolic for a couple months I would up it to the 30% but I am not happy with this particular peel ..  my skin doesn&#x27;t seem to feel any different after using it. I will continue to use it as I did pay for it and I will update if I notice any changes..</li>
    <li> Product did not help at all</li>
    <li> I mix a little bit of this in with my nightly moisturizer and my skin is so soft by morning. It&#x27;s been a really dry winter and my skin usually flakes, this eliminated it. I also use it as a spot treatment along with 2.5% Benzoyl. Works well!</li>
    <li> This was a great price, the product arrived very quickly and I got great customer service. It took me awhile before I tried it, I kept forgetting on Fridays and I didn&#x27;t want to do it when I had to work the next day just in case. Well, I finally tried it and my skin is so soft. I literally just got done using it so I&#x27;m not sure if there will be any sort of irritation or peeling. When I put it on I could feel it burning slightly. I only left it on for a minute (per directions) then I used baking soda to neutralize and the burning stopped. I hope it accomplishes what I would like. Will write follow up when I know.</li>
    <li> I have to say, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to. I&#x27;ve never had a peel before using this, so I cannot compare it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: There&#x27;s no PH listed, and inquiring doesn&#x27;t get a response. Also, keep away from light--Most glycolic peels are sold in amber bottles to prevent exposure, but this is in a clear bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: There&#x27;s a lot of product, cheap, and effective. I use once a week for 4 weeks, increasing time to 5 minutes, then take a two week break with a 10% cream. Works well, my skin is also very soft.</li>
    <li> I am loving the results I am seeing! Softer skin and my skin tone is evening out. Very Happy with this stuff.</li>
    <li> I switched over from a different brand I used to use, which is much more expensive, and so far the results have been the same.  I would recommend this peel to anyone.</li>
    <li> Exactly what it says on the tin. You access the instructions online, follow them, and do an at home peel. I haven&#x27;t had any strange reactions and this seems to be of similar quality to other DIY peels I have purchased in the past.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a frosted glass bottle, with a glass dropper and a plastic squeeze cap. The description says 15-20 full peels, but I think that is going to depend on your usage. If I did a heavy coating from hairline to collarbone, I don&#x27;t think I would get 15 peels from the bottle. However, you don&#x27;t want your acids to sit around forever without using them, either, as they will lose strength.&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in trying an at home peel and you know the risks, this is an affordable product to start with.</li>
    <li> This is not an overly diluted product.  I have paid a lot more for other branded versions.  I stocked up on this for me and my family.</li>
    <li> I tried this peel and nothing happened as far as any peeling goes. I did a skin test and it seemed fine. The next night I tried it and left it on for 3 minutes.. Nothing. No peel after three minutes. It&#x27;s been about 4 days and no changes to my skin. I don&#x27;t know what I could be doing wrong. I am following the instructions and no peel. Does anyone have any ideas?</li>
