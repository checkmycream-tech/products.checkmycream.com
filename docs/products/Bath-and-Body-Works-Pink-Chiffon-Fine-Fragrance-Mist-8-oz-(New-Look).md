      <li>This smells very sweet</li>
      <li>I love this scent, It&#x27;s light and girly, and you can smell it all day.</li>
      <li>Not too strong</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a girly scent that stays strong, you found it.</li>
      <li>It smells sweet but not over the top.</li>
      <li>Overall, great buy.</li>
      <li>I asked my mom if she liked Warm Vanilla or Pink Chiffon better</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance, it is just right.</li>
      <li>I was looking for their warm sugar vanilla because I needed a new vanilla like fragrance.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of it and the shipping was super fast.</li>
      <li>Other than that this is a great product.  </li>
      <li>I love trying new things - I probably wont purchase it again.</li>
      <li>Its a great balance of florals and sweets,  it even smells like vanilla a little bit.</li>
      <li>love the smell and my 4yr old does too</li>
      <li>i really don&#x27;t like how it wears off so quickly tho.</li>
      <li>Very fast delivery.  </li>
      <li>and the delivery was very fast.</li>
      <li>However, I am very much the girly girl</li>
      <li>so so so so so much!</li>
      <li>and I would love it if both could last longer</li>
      <li>&amp;lt;3 lovely scent would totally reccomend!</li>
      <li>I looked around a little bit at the other perfumes, I liked a lot of them but none of them really stood out to me as much as warm sugar vanilla.</li>
      <li>Yes, it wears off but only after like 6 hours, and keep in mind this is a mist, not perfume, so it shouldn&#x27;t really be that strong.</li>
      <li>Smells like cheap teen perfume</li>
      <li>It really isn&#x27;t my type of scent, I prefer something fruity or like baked sweets.</li>
      <li>Then I tried Pink Chiffon and fell in love.</li>
      <li>I absolutely adore it.</li>
      <li>Pink Chiffon is my new go-to body mist, I love it so much and even though I did not buy this on amazon</li>
      <li>I have so many other new scents to try -</li>
      <li>No leaks or messes bottle is new mo scratches or anything.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Delivered 1 week early!  </li>
      <li>The smell is not too sweet like some other scents.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft but the scent is a blast of intoxicating aromas.</li>
      <li>Lasts pretty long too</li>
      <li>In my family we have wish lists for Christmas, and we find it doesn&#x27;t make the presents any less special.</li>
      <li>The alcohol smell is slightly noticeable, but I don&#x27;t think its too bad.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty bottle, and sprays on really well.</li>

<li> The Fragrance Mist for this scent doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
<li> But it doesnt last very long.</li>

<li> I 💘 my pink chiffon.</li>
<li> be careful who it comes from.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of body spray and/or perfume that can&#x27;t last the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> If you want to spray only a little for it to last all day, buy the Eue Day Prafum in the small glass bottle.</li>
<li> Just like other Mist, you do need to spray alot to assure the smell stays all day.</li>
<li> you can smell the fragrance but .. its not very strong -- I wish it was stronger or lasted longer.</li>
<li> Amazon was not responsible for the lousy service I received from the actual mfg. of this</li>
<li> and I put it on everyday.  </li>
<li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with bath and body works any of their products.</li>
<li> I literally get so sad when its gone</li>

    <li> I loved the shower gel but the the spray is just okay - you can smell the fragrance but .. its not very strong -- I wish it was stronger or lasted longer.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance... Perfect for the summer. Not too strong</li>
    <li> love the smell and my 4yr old does too</li>
    <li> got this as a gift for a friend and she loves the smell and the cast was a lot cheaper than b&amp;bws</li>
    <li> Best scent ever this is my second time buying I literally get so sad when its gone this is my go. To fragrance :-)</li>
    <li> Great price for a sweet smelling fun frangrance. Glad I bought this.  Ann</li>
    <li> I love the smell! But it doesnt last very long. I have to keep spraying just so the scent can travel. Overall, great buy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;so don&#x27;t even need to say anything els, just love it~!</li>
    <li> This sent smells soooooo yummy! Lasts pretty long too so you don&#x27;t have to keep spraying yourself over and over and over again. and it&#x27;s a good deal!</li>
    <li> I came in to Bath and Body Works a few days ago looking for an entirely different body mist. I was looking for their warm sugar vanilla because I needed a new vanilla like fragrance. I looked around a little bit at the other perfumes, I liked a lot of them but none of them really stood out to me as much as warm sugar vanilla. Then I tried Pink Chiffon and fell in love. Its a great balance of florals and sweets,  it even smells like vanilla a little bit. I love sweet fragrances but without being nauseating, and this is perfect! I asked my mom if she liked Warm Vanilla or Pink Chiffon better and she said this one no contest. Pink Chiffon is my new go-to body mist, I love it so much and even though I did not buy this on amazon I just had to tell people how amzing it is, I totally reccoment this delightful body mist.</li>
    <li> Smells like cheap teen perfume</li>
    <li> Beautifully scented, this perfume has the capability to make anyone fall in love with it. It&#x27;s soft but the scent is a blast of intoxicating aromas. I absolutely adore it. My product came earlier than expected but that&#x27;s nothing to complain about. The package was well taken care of too. I cannot find one thing to complain about. If you&#x27;re looking for a girly scent that stays strong, you found it. This will make anyone feel like a princess.</li>
    <li> The mist last longer than the lotion and I would love it if both could last longer I love this smell</li>
    <li> It smells sweet but not over the top. The alcohol smell is slightly noticeable, but I don&#x27;t think its too bad.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty bottle, and sprays on really well.</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing but i guess not on me lol Idk</li>
    <li> Wonderful! I&#x27;ve used this product before, love the scent!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I 💘 my pink chiffon. Thank you !</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for mi wife</li>
    <li> Delivered 1 week early!  Super.speedy. &amp; nicely packaged!  Smells the way I excepted it to be,  No leaks or messes bottle is new mo scratches or anything.&lt;br /&gt;Smells amazayn!  It reminds me of Paris amour!  &amp;lt;3 lovely scent would totally reccomend!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes from bath and body works. This seems to last all day long, and I get a lot of compliments on it.</li>
    <li> This smells very sweet and I put it on everyday.  The one and only problem about it is that it doesn&#x27;t last all day unless you have the lotion and the shower gel.  Other than that this is a great product.  The smell is not too sweet like some other scents.  I recomend this if you plan on wearing the lotion and showering every morning with the gel.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery.  Extremely happy with purchase. I have purchase this before in the smaller size and decided to order a larger one. The scent is amazing, very light, sweet but enduring. Will buy for as long as possible.</li>
    <li> My friend got this for her birthday and I loved it! But then I went to Bath&amp;Body Works and they didn&#x27;t have it, so I just took a shot in the dark and got on here and actually found it. I love the smell of it and the shipping was super fast. Mine got here in only 4 days! Everyone tells me how good I smell and asks me what I&#x27;m wearing! I love it!  I recommend this to any and everyone!</li>
    <li> this smells pretty good! i really don&#x27;t like how it wears off so quickly tho. idk if i&#x27;d buy again, but still a great smell.</li>
    <li> I love this so so so so so much! It smells amazing. Yes, it wears off but only after like 6 hours, and keep in mind this is a mist, not perfume, so it shouldn&#x27;t really be that strong. Anyways this stuff is awesome and I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this scent, It&#x27;s light and girly, and you can smell it all day. Just like other Mist, you do need to spray alot to assure the smell stays all day. If you want to spray only a little for it to last all day, buy the Eue Day Prafum in the small glass bottle. (:</li>
    <li> My neice already had this product. i fell in love with the way it smelled. and the delivery was very fast. but its from bath and body works. of course it is gonna smell great!</li>
    <li> The Fragrance Mist for this scent doesn&#x27;t last as long. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of body spray and/or perfume that can&#x27;t last the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the scent itself, it reminds me of a Ballerina. Like Potpourri made from rose and summer petals with vanilla sugar. It really isn&#x27;t my type of scent, I prefer something fruity or like baked sweets. However, I am very much the girly girl and so are my friends - so I would totally suggest this smell to them and have already. My boyfriend loved the smell, though. I have so many other new scents to try - I love trying new things - I probably wont purchase it again.</li>
    <li> HAVE 2 OMG I LOVE THIS</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with bath and body works any of their products. This Fragrance is  very clean smelling and sporty.&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful who it comes from.  Amazon was not responsible for the lousy service I received from the actual mfg. of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend  this</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance, it is just right.The only down fall is scent doesn&#x27;t last all day, nevertheless  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Thrilled with my purchase will absolutely be buying more!</li>
    <li> Wonderful smells and it came early I am VERY happy with this purchase</li>
