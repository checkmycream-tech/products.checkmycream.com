      <li>IF YOU LIKE LIGHT, FRESH SCENTS THAT ARE NOT OVERPOWERING, YOU SHOULD TRY WHITE MOSS!!!!</li>
      <li>But something seems different about the scent -- heavier and more musky than I remember and certainly more masculine than unisex (I&#x27;m female).  </li>
      <li>Acca Kappa White Moss Cologne has a strong \\&quot;Woody\\&quot; scent.</li>
      <li>I spray it on every single day after my shower because it makes me feel so sexy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very lite</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years and loved it&#x27;s fresh, clean fragrance -- usually purchasing from Acca Kappa directly.  </li>
      <li>After wearing it a couple times, it just seemed too masculine for me, so I gave it to my husband.  </li>
      <li>Soft woodsy just a fragrance of moss.</li>

    <li> Love it ! A soapy type of fragrance...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years and loved it&#x27;s fresh, clean fragrance -- usually purchasing from Acca Kappa directly.  This time I ordered through Amazon.  The product arrived on schedule, and was packaged sufficiently to protect the bottle.  But something seems different about the scent -- heavier and more musky than I remember and certainly more masculine than unisex (I&#x27;m female).  I ended up giving it to my nephew, who loves it, but I will definitely not buy it again for myself.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE ACCA KAPPA WHITE MOSS PRODUCTS! IF YOU LIKE LIGHT, FRESH SCENTS THAT ARE NOT OVERPOWERING, YOU SHOULD TRY WHITE MOSS!!!! WISH IT WAS EASIER TO FIND! I USE IT DAILY AND HAVE GOT MANY FRIENDS HOOKED ON ACCA KAPPA PRODUCTS! THE MENS SCENT CEDAR IS LOVELY AS WELL!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been my favorite perfume for many years!</li>

People are left wondering what is that great scent because it doesnt overpower the scenses nor comes at you like a ton of bricks.  Like all rare things...this one is a keeper because very few know about this scent and its not sold in common locations!  A plus find!!  I LOVE YOU ACCA KAPPA and so do the folks that have said to me, \\&quot;you smell amazing, what is it!\\&quot;  My secret! :)</li>
    <li> I love its scent.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect!</li>

    <li> NO FRAGRANCE WHAT SO EVER! WOULD NEVER BUY AGAIN!</li>
    <li> Long before this was billed as a &amp;#34;unisex&amp;#34; fragrence, I bought a bottle for myself.  After wearing it a couple times, it just seemed too masculine for me, so I gave it to my husband.  He loves it and I think he smells fantastic when he wears it.  It is a light scent, and good for guys who don&#x27;t like to overpower people with their cologne.  Before this, I could not get my husband to wear any sort of cologne or aftershave - but now he wears this every day.  It has a light musky, fresh, clean smell.  Understated and yummy!</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite perfume... She loves the fresh clean scent and says it&#x27;s never overpowering.  Happy we were able to order it here on Amazon.  Arrived quickly at a fair price.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent. It&#x27;s very lite</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I have worn this for years and love it so much.  Soft woodsy just a fragrance of moss. cedar and Juniper bush.&lt;br /&gt;You could close your eyes and it makes you feel as though you are in a field by the ocean. YUM</li>
