      <li>(Yes, she was seen by a doctor who confirmed)</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s super easy to work with.</li>
      <li>I was going to originally get the Too Faced Glitter Glue that is 20 bucks but decided to try this since it is like 3 bucks.</li>
      <li>Worked great for loose eye shawdow glitter.</li>
      <li>how the primer part keeps your makeup on better for a whole days cover&#x3D;great product.</li>
      <li>I was still passable as being a super glittery person.</li>
      <li>There is some color with the primer (I&#x27;d prefer clear but its very very light regardless).</li>
      <li>I wait about 45 seconds for it to get tacky, then take a brush and pat the eyeshadow on again, directly where you want the most attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have sensitive eyes, so this was really great at not causing them to water or become red and itchy.</li>
      <li>But I do face paint and this works great for holding the glitter on designs on little children&#x27;s faces....which is quite a FEAT!</li>
      <li>it goes on so easy and is clear after you apply it.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use and dries clear.</li>
      <li>It was a bit goopy and didn&#x27;t keep as much glitter on as I hoped, but it worked!</li>
      <li>but I have OILY OILY OILY eye lids and love me some indie makeup.</li>
      <li>and it does hold the eyeshadow and glitter pretty well.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money and highly recommend!</li>
      <li>First of all let me tell you that I DONT wear make up</li>
      <li>4 stares because it is pretty pricey and doesnt come with much.</li>
      <li>buy really make my glitter ones pop.  </li>
      <li>But you don&#x27;t really to to apply a lot</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>Was very goo like .</li>
      <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
      <li>will shimmer the whole night.</li>
      <li>A Must for glitter eye shadow - it dries fast so</li>
      <li>It is quite a lot, and rather inexpensive for how much you will use.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery, idk how well it works yet.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t oily and really shines.</li>
      <li>, then place a bit of the Glitter primer in the center of my eye (or where I want the most shine to be).</li>
      <li>Specially for a one time or once in a blue moon glitter users.</li>
      <li>What I do is apply eyeshadow normally</li>
      <li>Heavy or light, this primer does the trick!</li>
      <li>I find, for glitter as well as loose pigment shadows, this works better than the regular primers.  </li>
      <li>( I live in pittsburg ca)</li>
      <li>I used this under free glitter for a girls night out and my glitter didn&#x27;t budge the entire night and even lasted the entirety of the next day.</li>
      <li>This stuff is as good for glitter as the more expensive brands and it doesn&#x27;t feel tacky or heavy.</li>
      <li>Holds loose glitter shadow VERY well!!</li>
      <li>So I wouldn&#x27;t wear it alone as the glue dries simply clear.  </li>
      <li>Far cheaper.</li>
      <li>Glue is definitely the right word here, it has a very similar consistency to Elmer&#x27;s Glue.  </li>
      <li>Ur eyelids will appear to stick together at first, but when dry it releases.</li>
      <li>It does seem to dry quick but not a big deal.</li>
      <li>It will hold really any eye shadow all day long</li>
      <li>I suggest getting this item in stores first since you can literally get it (along with other e.l.f. products) for $1.</li>
      <li>It kept the glitter right where I wanted it without making my eyelid feel stiff or sticky.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great does what it says it does</li>
    <li> Does the trick. Not to thick</li>
    <li> First of all let me tell you that I DONT wear make up so I cant vouch for everyday use. But I do face paint and this works great for holding the glitter on designs on little children&#x27;s faces....which is quite a FEAT! Sometimes after the paint has smeared off and the jewels have fallen off, the glitter applied to this glue is the only thing remaining!</li>
    <li> Received in excellent condition!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this just to use before applying my urban decay ammo palette eyeshadows, as there is a lot of glitter fallout. Works great!</li>
    <li> This product is good for makeup that have glitter to it, the product stay on and don&#x27;t wear out.</li>
    <li> Considering the price point on this item I just love it.  It isn&#x27;t oily and really shines. The glitter is just right without being overblown, too, which is a good thing.</li>
    <li> My daughter was given this in her makeup kit for use with glitter for her eyelid for cheer competitions. Her eye lids became swollen from this adhesive - so swollen that she could just barely open her eyes. The allergic reaction to three days to go away. (Yes, she was seen by a doctor who confirmed)</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.. Great results at a bargain price. Specially for a one time or once in a blue moon glitter users.</li>
    <li> I used this to basically &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; loose pigment to my eyelids. Oh boy, it stays put all day long! I might even ditch the pressed powder palettes and have fun with loose pigments as I have a ton of them in all sorts of wonderful colors...It&#x27;s not sticky or anything, you don&#x27;t even feel it under the eye shadow.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it just glues the heck outta the make-up on the eyelids, no more smudging, nasty-looking creasing or clown eyes, thank you Elf!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother getting the Too Faced Glitter Primer. This is way cheaper and works just as good.  I used it with a chunky eyeshadow. And it worked great. Can also be found in Target or Elf website</li>
    <li> I used tgis on two occasions one time it worked wonders but then the second time glitter was sliding off my eyelids. Not sure what went wrong.</li>
    <li> got this for my daughter since she asked for it and she loves the shimmer and how the primer part keeps your makeup on better for a whole days cover&#x3D;great product.</li>
    <li> Maybe I need some advice here but I have OILY OILY OILY eye lids and love me some indie makeup. With lots of indies you need a glitter primer so you can get all those sparklie goodies to stay on your face. I&#x27;ve used this with a regular primer and without but no matter what I do the darn stuff creases like a mother. I&#x27;m also not incredibly impressed with the amount of glitter this will hold on to. It&#x27;s tacky and it does grab some sparkle but not nearly enough.&lt;br /&gt;Also, get this in a store where it&#x27;ll cost you $1-2. (Target and Wal-mart both sell these in So Cal)</li>
    <li> Holds loose glitter shadow VERY well!!</li>
    <li> This product is ok. I just used it the other day and it does hold the eyeshadow and glitter pretty well. U have to use when still tacky, so dont be too slow applying the glitter. Ur eyelids will appear to stick together at first, but when dry it releases. Like i said, not the GREATEST hold, but works decently.&lt;br /&gt;*Mary H.</li>
    <li> This works great! Be careful where you apply it because glitter will stick and it&#x27;s tough to remove (without messing up your other makeup) It does seem to dry quick but not a big deal. I used this under free glitter for a girls night out and my glitter didn&#x27;t budge the entire night and even lasted the entirety of the next day. Great value, I definitely recommend picking this up!</li>
    <li> Was very goo like . It didn&#x27;t leave a nice finish</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, idk how well it works yet.</li>
    <li> This glue worked perfectly to apply glitter on my daughter&#x27;s cheeks and around her eyes.</li>
    <li> Did not keep my glitter shadow in place.</li>
    <li> It kept the glitter right where I wanted it without making my eyelid feel stiff or sticky. Easy to use and dries clear.</li>
    <li> Worked well with my glitter eye shadow, held all day.</li>
    <li> Very good gilltter primer</li>
    <li> I love this product! I usually use e.l.f.&#x27;s regular eyelid primer but ran out, and while I was at the Dollar Tree, I saw this. I don&#x27;t wear glitter eyeshadow, but this still works beautifully and does what I need it to do with regular eyeshadow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is sticky at first, but very easy to apply, blends well, and dries well. It holds up all day for me, too. I suggest getting this item in stores first since you can literally get it (along with other e.l.f. products) for $1. Definitely worth the money and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This arrived with in a week it&#x27;s super easy to work with. I dab some on a brush then on my lid, then I apply the glitter. It grabs on perfect holds the glitter no fall out and last!  You can&#x27;t beat this price I&#x27;m a freelance makeup artist and was going to invest in the toofaced one but there really is no need to now.</li>
    <li> Great primer.  Easy application and my eyeshadow stays on all day.</li>
    <li> Works well to apply my loose glitter as an eyeshadow- if anything it&#x27;s too hard to get off. ELF is always affordable and great value</li>
    <li> I loveeeeee this glitter glue! I was going to originally get the Too Faced Glitter Glue that is 20 bucks but decided to try this since it is like 3 bucks. and I love it. It keeps my glitter on all day as well as my chunky pigments as well. I love it!</li>
    <li> I love it but it&#x27;s cheaper at the stores ( I live in pittsburg ca)</li>
    <li> It was a bit goopy and didn&#x27;t keep as much glitter on as I hoped, but it worked! I was still passable as being a super glittery person.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel like a primer and there is no glitter on it!</li>
    <li> This is great for products that have a lot of glitteror the possibility of fallout - if you want your glittery eyeshadow to pop, you NEED this. All it takes is the tiniest amount and your lids will shimmer the whole night. It is quite a lot, and rather inexpensive for how much you will use. What I do is apply eyeshadow normally, then place a bit of the Glitter primer in the center of my eye (or where I want the most shine to be). I wait about 45 seconds for it to get tacky, then take a brush and pat the eyeshadow on again, directly where you want the most attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works like a charm!</li>
    <li> Works very well. You have to put the glitter on fast or it will dry and not make it stick, but other than that I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This worked awesome for applying my loose glitter on top! And for only a couple bucks, how could you go wrong?! I have sensitive eyes, so this was really great at not causing them to water or become red and itchy. I trust this product and would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic item! I&#x27;m very satisfied!!</li>
    <li> The product itself works great.  Please look for it at Target, however.  Far cheaper.</li>
    <li> There is some color with the primer (I&#x27;d prefer clear but its very very light regardless). It works perfectly before applying eyeshadow and foundation on the eyes.</li>
    <li> Feels like glue but doesn&#x27;t smear. Incredibly uncomfortable to have on my eyes, I won&#x27;t be using it ever again</li>
    <li> Works great as a primer, my eye makeup lasted.  Not so much a complaint as an observation, but I see no glitter, not even a hint of it, as other reviews noted.  So I wouldn&#x27;t wear it alone as the glue dries simply clear.  But again, as a primer it does the job.</li>
    <li> I love this glitter primer it goes on so easy and is clear after you apply it.  It will hold really any eye shadow all day long buy really make my glitter ones pop.  I&#x27;ve gotten so many complaintments since I&#x27;ve been using it.  Love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a primer specifically for glitter and did not want to spend 20+ dollars at sephora. I thought I would try this out as it retails for 2 dollars.  Glue is definitely the right word here, it has a very similar consistency to Elmer&#x27;s Glue.  I find, for glitter as well as loose pigment shadows, this works better than the regular primers.  Here&#x27;s why: this stuff remains tacky until you place another product on top.  That being said, there is still a little fall out with big-glitter shadows.  This, so far, is the best I&#x27;ve found for glitter primer, so I really would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is some serious bang for your buck! I figured I may be wasting some money since it&#x27;s only a few bucks but it&#x27;s great stuff! I&#x27;ve tried Too Faced, Sephora Collection, Ulta, Stila, etc. You name it, I&#x27;ve put it on my face. This stuff is as good for glitter as the more expensive brands and it doesn&#x27;t feel tacky or heavy. One user said it smelled bad, but I noticed no smell at all. If you love your glitter eyeshadows, you must give this a try.</li>
    <li> A Must for glitter eye shadow - it dries fast so do one eye at a time :)</li>
    <li> Works great for glitter!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Works Great. 4 stares because it is pretty pricey and doesnt come with much. But you don&#x27;t really to to apply a lot</li>
    <li> I love glittery shadows but I hate the fallout. I use this  under any eye shadow that has glitter and under my pigments, it keeps the color strong and lasts all day! It&#x27;s so cheap, seriously you can buy this in the store for only 2 dollars or you can spend over 20 for similar products. I was amazed on how well my shadows stayed all day! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for applying glitter and it lasts all day. Heavy or light, this primer does the trick!</li>
    <li> This does not crease and it stays put for most of the day.</li>
    <li> Works so well! I love it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awful. It has a terrible smell and makes my eyelids burn.</li>
    <li> for the price it work amazing</li>
    <li> Worked great for loose eye shawdow glitter.</li>
    <li> Works great, great buy.</li>
    <li> Works great with my glitter!</li>
