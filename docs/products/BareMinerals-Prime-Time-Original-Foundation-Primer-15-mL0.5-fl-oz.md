### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the best primer I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s good!</li>
      <li>Great product</li>
      <li>I heard really great things about face primer</li>
      <li>It feels good going on, and keeps my makeup in place all day.  </li>
      <li>I like Neutrogena products and have good experience with them, so I tried [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>My all-time favorite primer!</li>
      <li>The product itself is ok, it&#x27;s not something amazing</li>
      <li>Very good it makes your skin feel very soft.</li>
      <li>IT WORKS OK</li>
      <li>I love that this product seems to have no scent at all.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After having used this product for some weeks now, I must say that I&#x27;m quite satisfied.  </li>
      <li>Love love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I purchased a couple more as gifts for my friend and grandmother.</li>
      <li>I have not had any issues with this so far, though, which is rare and wonderful.  </li>
      <li>face makeup goes on more smoothly and stays on longer.  </li>
      <li>It is extremely smooth and applies easily.  </li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>I bought this primer because it was cheaper than buying it at the store where I purchased this product originally.</li>
      <li>Excellent product but to small.</li>
      <li>This primer also has an incredible price tag in my opinion, but this one was NOT worth the money.  </li>
      <li>Nothing special yet.</li>
      <li>Makes my face feel great soft and like a brand new me.</li>
      <li>I have combination skin and by the end of the day, my face was still super oily.</li>
      <li>With this product layered underneath, I think the foundation looks at least as good, and possibly better, than when I do not use this product.</li>
      <li>It gives a nice smoothing starting point for the mineral foundation and creates a satin-like finish!</li>
      <li>This is the first time i have ordered makeup products on line and was hesitant.</li>
      <li>I use it daily and it makes my makeup go on so smoothly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s only 0.5oz and for $14 to me that just isn&#x27;t worth it!</li>
      <li>My replacement bottle of Prime Time can&#x27;t come quick enough!!  </li>
      <li>It was super tiny for the price though.</li>
      <li>I am very sensitive to fragrances, and even some fragrance-free products bother me.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After I ran out of my first tube of Prime Time, I tried another brand that I purchased at the same time as Prime Time.  </li>
      <li>The breakouts were IMMEDIATE - same day as first applying the Neutrogena primer.  </li>
      <li>So overall it&#x27;s an ok product but not worth the price in my opinion</li>
      <li>I love this product there is no better then bare minerals.  </li>
      <li>I work 2 jobs, so I would constantly fix or redo my makeup at the end of my first job and before my second job.  </li>
      <li>A must have under Bare Mineral foundation!!  </li>
      <li>I would probably estimate that I use half (if not LESS) as much makeup as I used to.  </li>
      <li>I do not know but the liquid seems different than the one that I bought in the sore of Bare Minerals.</li>

<li> As I wrote in my review on that primer, it looked and felt like bright white lotion, applied incredibly thick and heavy, but the worst part was the BREAKOUTS!  </li>
<li> After using Prime Time, I find that I no longer touch up my makeup between jobs and I seem to be using significantly LESS makeup throughout the day.  </li>
<li> I was definitely not excited about the price and had a hard time accepting and understanding the cost for such a small item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It makes my face a little too shiny</li>
<li> Yes, it is expensive, but you get a lot of usage out of such a small tube.  </li>
<li> Too late to return - will never purchase again.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s very small!</li>
<li> I have noticed a dramatic difference in my makeup&#x27;s longevity throughout the day.  </li>
<li> I hope I am wrong.</li>

    <li> I do not know but the liquid seems different than the one that I bought in the sore of Bare Minerals. I hope I am wrong.</li>
    <li> Love love this stuff. Makes my face feel great soft and like a brand new me. I even have my kids using it</li>
    <li> Too late to return - will never purchase again.  Broke me out and please note, it is very tiny!  Not for me.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Nothing special yet. It was super tiny for the price though. I have combination skin and by the end of the day, my face was still super oily. I think I need the BM oil control version.</li>
    <li> I bought this primer because it was cheaper than buying it at the store where I purchased this product originally. This is the first time i have ordered makeup products on line and was hesitant. The tube looks different from the photo. Perhaps the company has changed it&#x27;s look? It seems to be the same product.</li>
    <li> A must have under Bare Mineral foundation!!  I only started using this last year and now I cannot do without it!!  It gives a nice smoothing starting point for the mineral foundation and creates a satin-like finish!</li>
    <li> My mom loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> I heard really great things about face primer so I looked into this product.  I was definitely not excited about the price and had a hard time accepting and understanding the cost for such a small item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having used this product for some weeks now, I must say that I&#x27;m quite satisfied.  As other reviewers have posted, you need only use a few dabs of the primer for it to cover your face and do its job.  It is extremely smooth and applies easily.  Yes, it is expensive, but you get a lot of usage out of such a small tube.  I dab about the size of a pea of the primer around my face and blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face makeup goes on more smoothly and stays on longer.  I have noticed a dramatic difference in my makeup&#x27;s longevity throughout the day.  I work 2 jobs, so I would constantly fix or redo my makeup at the end of my first job and before my second job.  After using Prime Time, I find that I no longer touch up my makeup between jobs and I seem to be using significantly LESS makeup throughout the day.  I would probably estimate that I use half (if not LESS) as much makeup as I used to.  This equates to money saved on makeup, which makes me feel better about the expensive price tag up front for the primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I ran out of my first tube of Prime Time, I tried another brand that I purchased at the same time as Prime Time.  BIG MISTAKE!  I like Neutrogena products and have good experience with them, so I tried [[ASIN:B0081E6TKC Neutrogena Shine Control Primer, 1 Ounce]].  This primer also has an incredible price tag in my opinion, but this one was NOT worth the money.  As I wrote in my review on that primer, it looked and felt like bright white lotion, applied incredibly thick and heavy, but the worst part was the BREAKOUTS!  I haven&#x27;t had breakouts like that in a long time.  The breakouts were IMMEDIATE - same day as first applying the Neutrogena primer.  I stopped wearing it immediately.  My replacement bottle of Prime Time can&#x27;t come quick enough!!  Go with the Prime Time primer - you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> This is the best primer I have ever used.  It feels good going on, and keeps my makeup in place all day.  This is my second one i have ordered and will order again.</li>
    <li> It makes my face a little too shiny</li>
    <li> I love that this product seems to have no scent at all.  I am very sensitive to fragrances, and even some fragrance-free products bother me.  I have not had any issues with this so far, though, which is rare and wonderful.  I have worn it a few times with Bare Minerals powder foundation.  With this product layered underneath, I think the foundation looks at least as good, and possibly better, than when I do not use this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased a couple more as gifts for my friend and grandmother. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this for anyone with extremely dry skin.</li>
    <li> The product itself is ok, it&#x27;s not something amazing but it&#x27;s good! Now the part that I&#x27;m upset with, as you can see from the picture it&#x27;s very small! It&#x27;s only 0.5oz and for $14 to me that just isn&#x27;t worth it! To my understanding it was a lot bigger than that! So overall it&#x27;s an ok product but not worth the price in my opinion</li>
    <li> Very good it makes your skin feel very soft.</li>
    <li> Excellent product but to small.</li>
    <li> Makes makeup stay in place all day without fading.  I love this product there is no better then bare minerals.  Great product</li>
    <li> I use it daily and it makes my makeup go on so smoothly. That&#x27;s all I have to say about it.</li>
    <li> Love it. Remember that a little of this product goes a long way.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS OK BUT NOT AS SMOOTHING AS SOME PRIMERS</li>
    <li> My all-time favorite primer! Feels like silk</li>
