<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product! It smells wonderful and it turns a nice milky white when mixed with water! A little goes a long way with this product!</li>
    <li> Let me start this review by saying that everyone&#x27;s skin is different, and you will of course have mixed reviews with any beauty product.  However, this is one product I will gladly recommend to anyone!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my late twenties, and have struggled with acne  from early adolescence through adulthood.  I do not have severe acne, but I always seem to have a pimple or two, with occassionally more severe breakouts (usually triggered by my menstrual cycle).  I have tried a HUGE number of different face washes, cremes, spot treatments, masks, scrubs, moisturizers........ you get the idea.  There have been a few through the years that I have had better results with than others, but none that I was really happy with.  I still felt like that even if I did everything right, kept up a regular routine, removed my make-up as soon as possible, my skin never really improved that much.  On top of my issues with breakouts, my skin is also very sensitive to chemicals and fragrances, and is prone to drying out and peeling, especially in the winter.  It always seems like a constant battle between trying to clear up my breakouts, and keeping my skin from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using this product, I am so happy with my skin!  The difference is amazing!  I will admit, I was skeptical about using oil instead of soap to wash my face, but it really does work!  After just 2 days, I could tell a huge difference in my skin!  After 2 weeks, I had essentially no breakouts!  I went from a breakout every couple days, to having just one minor breakout in an entire month!  My skin is softer, my nose isn&#x27;t oily, my skin isn&#x27;t drying out, my makeup goes on smoother and looks better.  I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!  I am never going back to soap after this!</li>
    <li> Has a strong floral soapy scent. Not too oily feeling, removes makeup pretty well. Left my skin smooth and glowing after washing it off. It&#x27;s pretty water resistant.</li>
    <li> I really like this.  I&#x27;ve started double cleansing my face and this oil is the first step.  I&#x27;ve never used it by itself but follow the oil cleansing with the SKINFOOD Aloe Vera Foaming Cleanser.  Makes my neck and face very clean and soft.  I just have to remember that just a little goes a long way.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cleansing oil.&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice and is very gentle on the skin. I massage it on to my dry face and it melts away makeup very well. Then I apply water to my face and work it into a milky white color and continue massaging for a minute more . Finally I rinse and my skin feels so soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> This gets all the makeup off my face (even my eyes) with minimal rubbing and irritation. I gently rub it into my skin to break down and  lift off any makeup/impurities and then I use a wet washcloth to wipe it away. It leaves my skin moisturized and not stripped/dry. It&#x27;s not heavy enough to make me break out or clog pores. I use a moisturizing toner or apple cider vinegar after sometimes, but not always. I have combination/sensitive skin. This is a permanent addition to my routine.</li>
    <li> Seriously, the best smelling oil cleanser I have ever used.  It smells DIVINE.  When I use it, it is the first product I use as part of my skin routine [like 9 products follow].  I squirt a little into my hand and PAT LIGHTLY [DO NOT RUB ANYTHING INTO YOUR FACE EVER!]  onto my face.  That takes about a minute.  Then I rinse off with lukewarm water.  A little goes a long way and it immediately breaks down make and impurities.  I have sensitive,dry skin and did not notice a reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I follow up with a foam cleanser [try etude wonder foam cleanser]/serum/eye creme/beauty mask [only once a week otherwise skip/try my beauty diary]/emulsion/moisturizer/water sleeping pack [only once a week]--I use leneige products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d heard a lot of good stuff about this, so I wanted to try it out ~ It&#x27;s pretty good guys! The fragrance is the only thing that I didn&#x27;t like too much, but that&#x27;s in the nose of the beholder XD It&#x27;s a very light oil, almost like water so be careful when you pump it out. It removes/breaks down pretty easily unless you&#x27;ve got stubborn products ~ Rinsing it off is so simple, and there is a clean feeling without the taut dry-ness. You could even use this as a massage oil for your face with an asian spoon and all that jazz ^_^ Overall, it&#x27;s great for anyone who wants to feel clean, but not SQUEAKY clean :3</li>
    <li> This product is very good! It&#x27;s light but effective, softly moisturizing while still very efficient at removing makeup and gently cleansing without over-stripping it. The scent is nice, light and fresh, not overpowering. And all the ingredients are safe and nourishing.</li>
    <li> This product came on time and it seems that my skin has already cleared up some after only a couple weeks of use! Amazing. I use it after black soap, and it is very restoring and calming.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like it I truly did, but it DOES NOT remove eye make up NOT even non waterproof eye liner.&lt;br /&gt;I use Revlon color stay eyeliner which is not waterproof and even if I massage this oil cleansing on my eyes it doesn&#x27;t remove it.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> I have to say that after years of purchasing tons of skin products (expensive, prescription, pretty much everything) this product has done THE MOST to give me the clearest, brightest complexion I have had since before adolescence. I thought it might break me out, because I have sensitive, acne-prone skin and it absolutely did not. I have completely stopped using many of my other expensive (clinique, dior, ren) skin care products  in favor of this simple routine: Rice water cleanser scrubbed with a natural sponge, followed by a tiny bit of mario baduscu&#x27;s glycolic cleanser. Moisturize at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m stocking up.</li>
    <li> Though this is an oil cleanser, it dried my skin out :( I have combination skin and it left my cheeks flaky and dry. I&#x27;m going back to just using coconut oil as my oil cleanser.</li>
    <li> Feels absolutely great on the skin. Very mild and lovely. First day using this and I feel like its going to be a nice trip with this cleansing water.</li>
    <li> I like the product very much for it&#x27;s use. I wear pretty light makeup and have oily skin so when using this, I don&#x27;t need a whole lot, but it removes my eye makeup very well. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the fragrance. It&#x27;s a little much. I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s necessary at all. It smells nice, but I use this to remove eye makeup and rubbing it very gently over my eyelids makes this burn my eyes. I want to love it but considering I use it for a particular purpose, it doesn&#x27;t do it for me. It&#x27;s not as if any other makeup is really hard to remove so this is something I feel could have been executed better.</li>
    <li> Washes make-up off really well without pulling or tugging on the skin.  The floral smell is a little strong for me but not offensive.</li>
    <li> This is a gentle oil cleanser that removes even the most stubborn makeup. I use it at night and then follow up with a second cleanser. Great product.</li>
    <li> i use it mostly to remove my makeup and then wash my face with soap</li>
    <li> I use this product daily. My skin has brightened and cleared. It removes makeup, including eye make up. After use I use toner, moisturizer primer, and moisturizer (all Lush Cosmetics products).</li>
    <li> i use this cleansing oil to remove my makeup everyday and it didnt make me break out and i think this is an important thing because its an oil and we tend to believe that cleansing oils make your skin more oily, but this doesnt.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! I have never before used an oil based cleanser  and was completely blown away by this product. When washing my face after a long day of wearing makeup, this stuff almost melts the makeup off my face. Its so gently and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue behind ! This is now a staple in my beauty regime.</li>
    <li> Love this cleansing oil!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very light, smells very delicate and works great if you know how to properly use this stuff. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> clean make up well and give my face a shiny look.</li>
    <li> love it....cleans well</li>
    <li> I have normal/ combination skin and occasionally get pimples (post accutane) and was having troubled skin just a week ago. After one use two pimples on my face went away overnight. Now after 5 days all of my face except one spot is clear and no new blemishes have come. Great product, great price, fast delivery. 5/5 would recommend.</li>
    <li> Previously, I used DHC Deep Cleansing Oil. I must say, that I actually like this cleansing oil better, even though the DHC one seems to be a more popular choice! This oil does have a very strong flowerly smell to it, but I don&#x27;t mind it at all. I was afraid it would affect my skin because I do have sensitive-dry skin, but it didn&#x27;t have any negative reaction!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;am very happy with this cleanser, great price and it has lighten my complexion overall.</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  Removes make up and dirt.  My skin feels clean and soft and the smell is so refreshing.  I will continue to use this cleansing oil.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest cleanser I have ever tried. I never thought I would enjoy putting oil on my face, but this product does wonders. It cleans so well and it has lasted quite a while as well. I will definitely try more cleansing oils in the future because of this product. I would recommend this item and repurchase!</li>
    <li> My FAVORITE cleanser of all time. I&#x27;ve used nars, mizon, neutrogena, lab etc and so many more, but THIS one takes away the dirt build up and makeup from the day with ease. I like how you don&#x27;t need to rinse the face first and it is still is effective in taking off grime from liquid eye liner and mascara. Will be using this for the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> After changing to a cleansing oil I noticed a dramatic change, because my makeup would full come off. I do still go back with a gentle cleanser but my skin doesn&#x27;t get that dryish feeling after washing my face now. To be honest I haven&#x27;t used it consistently to know whether or not it has a brightening effect. After this finishes I plan on trying oil cleansers from other brands to have a better scope at it.</li>
    <li> Really impressed with this product. The texture is slightly different from other cleansing oils I&#x27;ve tried (DHC, Josie Maran, Tatcha, Boscia), it is very thin, almost water-like. It seems to &#x27;absorb&#x27; into the skin yet it immediately breaks down makeup. It rinses totally clean, leaving the skin feeling cleansed though not stripped. Definitely a great first cleanse appropriate for most skin types (those with VERY dry skin might be dissatisfied due to the thin, watery texture). It does contain fragrance - a sort of fresh floral - that doesn&#x27;t bother me (I&#x27;m hyper-sensitive to certain fragrances) nor does the scent linger.</li>
    <li> Obsessed with this cleanser, it has really cleared up my skin dramatically. Highly recommend it and it smells great too.</li>
    <li> Can not remove eyes make up</li>
    <li> This product works perfectly. I have combination skin with occasional hormonal acne and I use this on a daily basis. Apply it to dry skin and massage for a minute, and then remove it with a wet washcloth. I do follow up with a toner to clean up any makeup I may have missed. I&#x27;ve had a noticeable improvement in pore size and it hasn&#x27;t caused me to break out any more than normal.</li>
    <li> I really like this cleansing oil. It is lightweight and takes off my day of makeup like a champ.  Not only does it do that but it really lives up to its name and actually does brighten the skin.  I no longer have acne, but I do still have some dark spots left over from it and within the month that I&#x27;ve been using it, it has helped to dramatically reduce these.  How I use it is to first, apply it to dry skin and rub it all over.  After doing this, I take a hot washcloth and wipe it off with this.  After this step, I then use a foaming face wash and my skin it perfectly clean, but not dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that I did was test this against my other makeup removers.  I had Pond&#x27;s cold cream, Jergen&#x27;s multi-purpose cream and Queen Helene facial whip and did a test on my hand to see how it handled waterproof black eyeliner, and although the others did a good job liquifying the eyeliner, it still took alot of rubbing to remove it completely.  With this one, just one quick swipe and bam....eyeliner melted and removed easily with washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I highly recommend this, especially for acne skin.  The double cleansing of fist with a makeup removing oil followed by washing with a gentle facial wash made my skin do a 360 change for the better and still get compliments to this day on it.</li>
    <li> This oil cleaner is wonderful! It melts the makeup right off my face and smells fantastic. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling filmy or greasy, just soft. I use this as part of a two step cleansing process- this first and then an acne wash and it has really helped curb my breakouts. I do wish the product was more easily contained, I feel like you lose a lot of it between the pump and your face. Sometimes to help that, I will mix this with a pump of Cerave cream cleanser for a more substantial wash.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really really great.</li>
    <li> I really like this! I was skeptical at first since I have combination skin and&lt;br /&gt;am afraid of breakouts, but this was pleasant to use, has no odors and makes my face baby smooth. The only challenge I had was completely taking it off. You rinse it with water and massage it in until it&#x27;s whitish and you can rinse it off, but there is still an oil residue that&#x27;s left, but I use a toner after to remove any residue.</li>
    <li> Love this product, a little goes a long way.  Leaves face clean and soft.</li>
    <li> Love this product. After reading about Korean skin care regimen on how they double clean their skin, I gave it a try. Seems like my skin is cleaner and clearer. I definitely would recommend this product. My skin is sensitive, combination skin.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this stuff had a very strong scent for a face product. Though, don&#x27;t let that scary you away, it is very light and the oil just absorbs right into your skin. Newest addiction.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still not sure I&#x27;m using it right, mostly because I take a shower at night, so a lot of my makeup is washed off already. But, I do use it afterwards to pick up the stuff the shower might not have. It makes my skin less irritated, smells good, and is very smooth. The shipping was on time, and it came with a really cute note and a free sample! I recommend this product and the seller!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> came really early and I love the way it makes my face feel</li>
    <li> This product is gentle, multi-purpose, and fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very tall bottle with a lot of liquid so you really get your money&#x27;s worth -- I can tell I will be using this product for the next couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With regards to how to use this product, there are lots of different answers. For me, I love to use it in my makeup-removing routine. Often times, even with the most gentle make-up removing toilettes, sensitive skin can feel really irritated, peeled clean, and red. I love using this product after makeup-removing toilettes because it&#x27;s so gentle, removes even the most stubborn of makeup, and allows my skin to really breathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> Removes makeup very well. However it feels very oily and makes you want to wash your face after you&#x27;ve washed your face with it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing! Cleans and moisturizes in one step.</li>
    <li> i have dry but then oily skin, this oil is SUPER good with my skin though. It removes ALL my make up, and it makes my skin look smoother (in my opinion) it doesn&#x27;t have an annoying strong smell, its a soft smell and i like it :) i really recommend this</li>
    <li> Love! It is a very nice lightweight cleansing oil. Gets rid of all of my makeup (except for waterproof mascara - can leave traces behind) and doesn&#x27;t leave tooooo much of a film. Still does and it bothers me a little bit but I mean, it&#x27;s an oil so of course it will. I am someone that loooooves that squeaky clean feeling so I always always always follow up with a cleansing foam but this works very well on its own as well!</li>
    <li> Alright so I was really hesitant to buy this but I thought &amp;#34; why not &amp;#34;. Thank God I tried it out because it&#x27;s amazing! It smells great and when I wear make up it takes off whatever the make up wipe remover couldn&#x27;t take off.  I absolutely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> The oil worked nicely to cleanse skin but it definitely has some crazy detergent in the ingredients it burns my eyes even if I I&#x27;m careful to avoid the eye area which for me is kinda the point of using an oil cleanser to remove waterproof eye makeup</li>
    <li> I love this so much! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month but fell in love the first time I used it. The first time I had like sand or some grit on my skin and was surprised! Because no one expects that on their face... I really do like to use it to clean my face. I do think it has contributed to my skin being brighter but I&#x27;ve done an overhaul of my skin routine.. so it is hard to tell. But I would definitely give this a try if you have the chance!</li>
    <li> I had a severe reaction to this product. Everything was going well until I rinsed it off. After rinsing, my face started burning and feeling numb. It shrunk my pores, but not in a good way. My throat also started closing up and I felt quite dizzy. Had to wash my face twice with a different cleanser to get it off, and even after moisturizing, my face was still burning. Not a pleasant experience in the least. I would not reccomend this to people with sensitive skin, or really anyone for that matter, as this was the first time I have ever had a reaction like this to a facial product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product but I would not consider buying it the second time. It&#x27;s a bit harder to wash off and it has the fragrant smell which I&#x27;m concerned about its chemical contents.</li>
    <li> Great product and very gentle.  I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> hands down the best cleansing oil ever!!!</li>
    <li> Whyyyy have I not used this before?! It is now my favorite thing about my routine and I&#x27;m already planning to purchase another bottle.</li>
    <li> If you tend to have dry skin, this is your go to after soap and water finisher.  Now, it doesn&#x27;t remove my make up the way I like but I bought the foam cleaner to wash with and this apply after to &#x27;moisturize&#x27; my face in the shower.  The desert is harsh on skin, esp if your over 40 and I need all the help in the moisture department I can get.  Just a couple of pumps and my skin feels soft and smooth.  If your oily or acne prone, I would be careful.......</li>
    <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s really melt away my waterproof mascara.</li>
    <li> Smells good, leaves the skin soft and moist.</li>
    <li> Does seem weird that an oil is made for oily skin, but it works great. Just use one or two pumps and massage onto face, no need to wet face either. Washes off really well and does not leave any oil behind and cleans pores and reduces oil on skin for a good while.</li>
    <li> The scent is a little bit off-putting but overall I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Love how it&#x27;s light oil!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an easy way to remove your makeup while cleansing your face, then this is you best option. I have a dry and sensitive skin and this works the best for my skin. I can describe how this product literally saves me after a long day with make up on. It clears my skin in seconds and removes stubborn eye make up and eye linear easily. It smells soothing and light and its texture is not too oily whatsoever. I am buying this oil cleanser for the forth time now and I have no regrets.</li>
    <li> This product has a fantastic scent and texture. It smooths over your face with just one or two pumps and quickly removes makeup and sunscreen, leaving your face clean but not the dreaded &#x27;squeaky clean&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Removes make up with ease while leaving skin soft.</li>
    <li> I started having a bad breakout this summer when I stopped taking the medication by dermatologist recommended (I was kinda scared of the side effects,that&#x27;s why). So I did some research online and found something that&#x27;s missing on my skin care regimen- cleansing oil. I found this cleansing oil from watching YouTube  and quickly ordered one from amazon. I could say that it&#x27;s one of the best skin care products I have tried. My breakouts did not only disappear from one week of using it, but it has pretty much calmed down my sensitive skin. It does an excellent job in removing make up (I also use it for eye make up) and leaves my face feeling clean (but not dry) before I even use my facial cleanser. I have suffered from sunburn in my face from failure to use sunblock in the past, but this cleansing oil has some brightening effects that made my skin tone more even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I could think of is that it stings my eyes a little bit. But I have very sensitive eyes to begin with so I&#x27;m not sure if this happens to other users. The pros are much more helpful though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first item from The Face Shop skin care line that I have ever used. But since I&#x27;m very impressed with this cleansing oil, I ordered their facial foam wash today at amazon. Hoping to get amazing results from this as well!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good to be used and it smells good</li>
    <li> Does not clean as well as another cleansing oil but for the price it is great.</li>
    <li> With just one pump and rubbing it in my face with my hands it makes all my make up go away. After doing this I found out that it&#x27;s better to take it off with a cotton pad and then some warm water. I use my Clarisonic after doing this and it&#x27;s better if you don&#x27;t miss the warm water step or the soap just don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now and it is a great product. I used to only use face wash but this is a great add on to my daily routine. My face feels cleaner and it definitely adds moisture to my face.</li>
    <li> This is amazing! it makes the makeup melt off! it also smells amazing and my skin feels great after using it! i will be buying this forever!! shipping takes a few wees but sooooo worth it!! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sad to not write a positive review for this since I was really excited to receive it. This is a good cleansing oil if you are committed to double cleansing or have never used a higher end cleansing oil. I have dry skin so I use cleansing oils as my everyday cleanser (in addition to using them for removing makeup) I have the shu uemura anti/oxi cleansing oil and the max clinic rose vitamin oil. Both cleanse effectively and wash away with no residue. What I like best with these two is that double cleansing is completely unnecessary. Sadly, The Face Shop cleansing oil leaves an oily residue on the skin. I could not imagine using this without washing my face a second time. Alone, it is a recipe for breakouts even on skin as dry as mine. In the end just not for me given my needs. I&#x27;ll stick with the brands I know and love even if they are a bit more expensive.</li>
    <li> I usually use organic oil for oil cleansing so I can feel that this is not 100% natural but works great</li>
    <li> Great product! It makes my skin smooth and bright the first time I used it</li>
    <li> Smells nice,  feels good, cleans makeup off very well,  but it&#x27;s oil and I thought it was cleaning water.  I didnt want an oil.</li>
    <li> I love the scent, although I do wish it wasn&#x27;t as heavily scented.  This is more glamorous to use, although I think my old fashioned cold cream is more effective at getting makeup off and more emollient, so I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.  But it&#x27;s still a good product.</li>
    <li> It removes all makeup, including water-proof, and doesn&#x27;t dry out skin. Wet face, apply the product and add water to thin out the consistency. I took 1 star off because you still need to cleanse your face afterwards with a regular cleanser.</li>
    <li> It removes makeup well but burns my skin. Seems a bit over fragranced.</li>
    <li> Heavier than I expected but it smells nice</li>
    <li> Love love this oil very light and soft scent . I have combination to oily skin and this product leaves my face with a matte look and feel clean and fresh best buy compare to my other oil cleanser that leaves my face feeling oily</li>
    <li> A nice pleasant scent and very effective in removing makeup.</li>
    <li> This is just so good. It smells good, it cleans good, it rinses off good. It&#x27;s amazing. Just repurchased and will keep doing so.</li>
    <li> I like to use this twice a day for my skincare regime. My favorite thing about it so far (apart from the rejuvenating, softening effects on my skin) is that it feels extremely nice and relaxing to use as a cleansing oil. It feels like a serum that&#x27;s so smooth to massage in small circles into my skin. I am a Filipina with eczema on various parts of my face and this does a wonderful job of making my skin feel supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the double-cleansing method, with this as my cleansing oil and then with a neutrogena gentle gel cleanser (followed by a few of the other steps in the Korean skincare process, ex. toning, face mask, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just feels good; it just feels so, so soothing during cleansing process that you can just smooth along your face in various patterns. Feels like it&#x27;s not just cleansing your skin; it&#x27;s replenishing and nourishing it as well. Just be careful not to waste lots of it! It&#x27;s quite liquidy and can slip between the cracks of your fingers even when you clench them together tightly, so don&#x27;t wait too long when transferring from the bottle to your face. Tip: when it drips through your fingers and through to the back of your hand, use the back of your hand to apply the dripping remaining amount of the pump to your face (so as to not waste) it ^^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Amazon for such fast shipping. It&#x27;s my go-to for any of these skincare products that I can&#x27;t get in any stores nearby.</li>
    <li> good product good dealer fast delivery</li>
    <li> THE BEST MAKEUP REMOVER I HAVE EVER USED. ONE PUMP IS PLENTY!!</li>
    <li> Hate this left oily residue all over my face burns my skin gave me a horrible breakout and didn&#x27;t even remove my makeup when I rinsed it. I have the neutrogena light cleansing oil and it&#x27;s amazing it&#x27;s definitely a better choice if you want something that completely removes your makeup and rinses off clean leaving your skin refreshed</li>
    <li> Really nice and clean formula. I have sensitive skin with rosacea and wanted a light oil for double cleansing. This is so light that I skipped the second cleanse altogether. I should note that there is a very mild and clean scent that I actually find pleasing. Pretty remarkable considering most scents bother both me and my skin.  4 stars instead of 5 because I feel it could be more moisturizing for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this oil. The first time I used it was right after I got out of the shower, my face was clean...or so I thought. I applied the oil just to give it a try. A tiny squirt that I rubbed onto my fingers to easily distribute onto my face. The oil is light and had a soft scent that I&#x27;d describe as powdery with a hint of flowers. I massaged the oil in a circular motion onto my face and later removed it with a cotton ball, and to my amazement the cotton ball was dirty, ew! Mind you, I had not been using any makeup that day. This oil picked up dirt (most likely dead skin) that I didn&#x27;t know was there! That&#x27;s also why I use a cotton ball, so I can see what I&#x27;ve picked up. I later applied water to rinse off what was left of the oil and later washed my face again with a Korean brand of face soap that I ordered along with this oil. My face felt fresh and clean without any tightness or dryness. My skin type is: combination with an oily t-zone. I&#x27;ve been using this for several days now and it removes makeup so well. I just put a pump or two onto my fingers and massage the oil all over my face, concentrating on the areas where I applied makeup, remove the oil with a cotton ball, rinse my face with water, then apply face soap ( just started using a Korean brand) because I like to make sure everything is thoroughly clean. Just to let you know, the oil is light and watery. I would say that it&#x27;s a dry oil and doesn&#x27;t really leave you greasy like oils do (I can&#x27;t read Korean so not sure if they would call it a dry oil, but it sure does feel that way). If you don&#x27;t want to have it drip off of your fingers you could use a cotton ball or cotton pad to apply it onto your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil came shrink wrapped and taped up in bubble wrap. There&#x27;s a tiny stopper under the nozzle of the bottle that you remove to activate the pump. No packaging/box was with this face oil but it&#x27;s alright with me, I can&#x27;t read what it would say anyways. I included a photo of how my bottle arrived in the shrink wrap, which was pretty secure as the pump cannot be activated unless you remove the stopper, and the shrink wrap prevented the nozzle from turning during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is a great add to my daily cleansing routine and I&#x27;d order it again.e arrived in the shrink wrap, which was pretty secure as the pump cannot be activated unless you remove the stopper, and the shrink wrap prevented the nozzle from turning during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is a great add to my daily cleansing routine and I&#x27;d order it again.</li>
    <li> I generally don&#x27;t like &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; products for my skin, but this product is an exception. It manages to take all my makeup off and rinses off with no trace of oil. After patting dry, my skin feels soft and clean.</li>
    <li> I bought this wanting a mineral oil free, affordable oil cleanser to remove my sunscreen and help clear my pores. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and it hasn&#x27;t done much for me. This is the first oil cleanser I&#x27;ve bought but before that I&#x27;d been using my own blend of sunflower oil and tea tree oil. This is a nice cleansing oil but for the price and how well it works I&#x27;d rather just use my sunflower oil. The first thing I noticed is the smell, very strong, perfumey, I find it to be a pleasant scent, similar to a lot of other products that try to come off as &amp;#34;luxurious.&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t mind it. Next, it&#x27;s very runny, a little goes a long way. The texture feels more heavy on my skin than my regular oil.It removed my sunscreen and makeup pretty just as well, and I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in pore size or acne (it didn&#x27;t break me out or help prevent any breakouts). When it emulsifies it stills leaves a bit of residue that&#x27;s a little lighter than my regular oil. I use a foaming cleanser after and its all gone. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll repurchase, if I do it will be just for removing my sunscreen in the middle of the day, and not for heavy duty cleaning at the end of the night.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin that is prone to occasional breakouts on my T-zone. I was looking for something to not just remove my makeup, but really help massage it out and not just wipe it off. This product is a new staple in my skincare routine! I remove my eye makeup first, and then take 2-3 pumps of this and start gently massaging it all over my face. This product emulsifies your makeup and lifts it from the skin without drying. I massage for about 1-2 minutes, then gently wipe my face clean with a makeup remover wipe. My skin is left completely free of makeup but still feels moist and healthy. My complexion has become more glowy and bright since using this product. I absolutely recommend this to anybody who wants to really remove their makeup well without scrubbing it off or having to hurt your skin.</li>
    <li> Good and quick makeup remover but the fragrance is not my fav, irritates my skin a lil bit bc of the fragrance. :/</li>
    <li> It helps when you have leftover residue of makeup on your face. There is a faint scent to it but it&#x27;s not bad at all. It looks like a milky substance when you add water. Its also very gentle on your skin and does brighten it a little.</li>
    <li> I like this, the product is very light and watery. More watery than oily, after applying this you can feel your face being really soft. I like to clean my face using clarisonic mia 2 + a pore cleanser after using this because I don&#x27;t think all dirt and residue accumulated during the day was actually removed. If this is your first time using oil to cleanse your face, I think its best if you do double wash.</li>
    <li> This face oil is a great price. It is very watery when you squirt it so I use a cotton ball to apply it to my face, then wash my face with cleanser after using the oil to remove my makeup. It works great, is very moisturizing, and doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out (my break outs actually happened less after starting using this!</li>
    <li> This does a great job of removing my makeup! I put a bit onto a dampened cotton ball and a little goes a long way. It does not make my skin greasy, and I do have oily skin. I was using Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser every day after using this, but I have started only cleansing three to four times a week because the cleanser was drying out my skin and is not necessary after this non-greasy formula. You may have different results but I quite like it</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It removes every trace of makeup and makes my skin feel super soft afterwards. I&#x27;m a Korean skincare convert because of products like this!</li>
    <li> Oh I just love how this melts even my waterproof mascara and eyeliner right off! I can put on heavy foundation and it&#x27;s nothing this product can&#x27;t take away. Two pumps into my hand and I massage all over my face and eyes and rinse with water. I  follow it up innisfree&#x27;s olive real cleansing foam to remove the oil completely and have beautiful, soft, make-up free face!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like this at all. You have to use a lot to wash any make up off and even if I don&#x27;t use on my eyelids, it seems to get in my eyes a bit when I wash, even if I wash my eyes well. Also, if you have allergies, like I do, the scent is not great. It has kind of a floral scent, I think rosey. As an allergy prone person, floral scents are the last thing I want. I didn&#x27;t read anything about a floral scent. So, overall, I don&#x27;t think it cleans very well and doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that this would be my new holy-grail product and I am so happy I wasn&#x27;t let down.  I LOVE this stuff. It smells amazing, fresh, clean, maybe a little fruity?  It says &#x27;oil&#x27; and me living in a humid part of the world and already having oily skin, I was nervous to try an oil cleanser.  I am so happy I gave this stuff a shot.  It isn&#x27;t hick and &#x27;oily&#x27; like a hair oil or vegetable oil, it is really light.  It feels almost like you are putting water on your face and it smells lovely. The smell isn&#x27;t strong and doesn&#x27;t linger on the skin, but it is noticeable when you put it on your face.  It just melts the makeup away. I love it. I used to go through one or two makeup remover wipes a night. This stuff is great because one pump rubbed into your face and eye-makeup dissolves and removes almost every trace of my makeup. I will take a wipe, tissue-paper, or warm water to get the oil off my face; which ever method I feel like using, they all work.</li>
    <li> Love this product so much! It really gets off any excess makeup that I still have on after using makeup wipes. It&#x27;s very good at removing any eye makeup that is being very persistent on staying on your face. It also has a nice scent and leaves your face feeling very soft and refreshed after using it. It&#x27;s not too oily, and it doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes at all.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m someone with generally oily skin, and have struggled with acne for at least 6 years; and this product has been working very well for me with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;Within 5 days of me using this product, I could see a difference in my skin. My skin looked brighter and overall it just looked so much better.&lt;br /&gt;I had one bottle for over 6 months before it ran out. And once I ran out, I immediately purchased a second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: Would very much recommend</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin soft,clear,and bright! I&#x27;m in love with The Face Shop products!</li>
    <li> love this product.. it has a pleasant smell that i like and gets rid of my make-up super fast. better than using wipes. it even removes the waterproof mascara and eyeliner that i use.. would recommend this product 100%</li>
    <li> I love this cleansing oil. I am a first time user of cleansing oil and I highly recommend this one. I use it either on its own or in combination with another cleanser depending on how dry or oily my skin is. It leaves my skin so soft and smooth and not too tight. Despite the international shipping, this product still arrived very quickly, so I was really surprised.</li>
    <li> My skin looks great. I have a little trouble rinsing it off, sometimes it seems like it takes ages. I could just be using too much though. A washcloth makes the process go very quickly. It feels soft and smooth after its rinsed and sometimes I don&#x27;t even need to use moisturizer. I have combination skin and it doesn&#x27;t make me greasy.Or give me that tight dry feeling I hate.</li>
    <li> I use this daily with a foaming cleanser afterward.  It works well to clean off makeup.  If you use it with a foaming cleanser after, all of your makeup will most probably be washed off.  It leaves the skin feeling smoother and more moisturized/soft.  I would recommend this item for daily use.</li>
    <li> Initially I was hesitant to use this cleanser because it was oil based and I felt as though I would start breaking out like crazy if I used it. After giving it a try and adding it to my skincare routine I realized how great of a product this was. It prevented my face from being stripped of all natural oils and drying out after following up and cleansing with my regular cleanser. Give double cleansing a try perhaps it will work for you too!</li>
    <li> arrived with broken pump. doesnt get eye makeup off. wouldnt order again. shisheido oil cleanser is preferable.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best cleanser I have ever had so far</li>
    <li> My favorite cleansing product to date. I have oily skin and this product works perfectly to clean my pores. Leaves skin feeling fresh and smooth. Honestly, it should be incorporated into everyone&#x27;s daily skincare routine.</li>
    <li> A great everyday face wash. Not too oily or too drying either.</li>
    <li> this is my first asian oil cleanser -- apply it to a wet face and also rub it with wet hands and it will foam up very slightly. i like the scent and the packaging, and it&#x27;s fine for removing complexion makeup (foundation, blush, etc.) however it is NOT good for removing eye makeup and stings if you get it in your eyes. my previous go-to for makeup removal is lush&#x27;s ultrabland, which is just an almond oil-based cold cream. i&#x27;m willing to try other cleansing oils, but for now i&#x27;m going back to lush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;re okay with having to use a separate eye makeup remover, then this is fine. also, a lot of potential irritants in the ingredients, if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> An amazing oil! Removes makeup but isn&#x27;t super thick like some of the other oil based cleansers out.</li>
    <li> Nice cleanser.  On the oily side but it helps remove makeup.</li>
    <li> Recently a friend told me about this cleansing oil used for make up removal and swore by it. on a whim, I decided to try it out. After waiting a few weeks for it to ship from Korea, this fresh product is becoming a great part of my routine. I carry it in my gym pack and use it when I arrive to get all my makeup off pre-workout (I absolutely hate dealing with runny mascara while hitting the treadmill!) I plan to get this in the future. I would say be prepared to wait a few weeks for it&#x27;s arrival, unless you find a local seller.</li>
    <li> This cleansing oil is a great step in washing away any makeup on your face. Just less than one pump is enough for me, and the oil really seems to melt off any residue. I have normal skin with an oily-ish tzone and it leaves my face feeling soft and very nice. This product doesn&#x27;t break me out at all! I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase when I run out!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m gone to start off by saying, I&#x27;m not a negative person, I want to see the good in everything. With that said, please do take a grain of salt with my review.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I have combination skin, I get a pimple here or there(maybe once a month), perfectly fine because it&#x27;s usually in my forehead and chin area so I can cover it with my bangs, on the EXTREMELY rare occasion I get a pimple on my cheeks and or under my nose area. Again, perfectly fine, we&#x27;re all human. but other than that, I have clear skin from the forehead down.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I was in the market to get an inexpensive facial cleanser to replace a much more expensive &#x27;designer&#x27; brand, and everyone told me to try this product. After doing some homework, checking the price and reviews I was satisfied with what I found and bought it. The shipping was a NIGHTMARE. I had to wait MORE than a month for it to arrive, but I was understanding, it was from another country, no harm no foul. but it finally got to me, and I was so excited to try it!&lt;br /&gt;After the first 3 times using it, i notice more than the usual number of blemishes on my forehead, and they were becoming BIG and quite painful. OK, no need to panic, maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong. I search up how to properly use it, and the next wash went great, it worked like the online instructions said it would. But the pimples kept coming, this time migrating to my T zone, and then around my lip area, and now I have small little red spots scattered over my cheeks. So, I&#x27;m freaking out now because my face looks like a pepperoni pizza, literally COVERED in little angry red and white dots. It&#x27;s gotten so bad that even my mom took the bottle-which was still half way full-and threw it in the trash yelling at me for ruining my skin.&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m not going to buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, on the bright side, this is an amazing make up remover. Before it wrecked havoc on my skin, the first few time I did use it at the end of the day to remove bb cream, concealer and mascara, it did an amazing job.&lt;br /&gt;To recap, while yes, this product works for A LOT of people- even people I trust enough to take they&#x27;re recommendation- I does NOT work for me and my skin.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Leaves my skin super soft and hydrated. Light scent to it, nothing overpowering. Have noticed that my skin has improved.</li>
    <li> Good for removing make up</li>
    <li> Using oil is the only way to really get make-up out of your pores and this Face Shop Rice Water works beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s lightweight, smells nice, and washes off easily.And because it&#x27;s an oil, it doesn&#x27;t strip your skin of the natural ingredients you need to have a balanced skin ph.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a lot of research before I bought this- actually searched &amp;#34;Korean Skin Regimens&amp;#34; because Korean women are known for their beautiful skin and I wanted to know how to accomplish the same.  This product repeatedly showed-up in the top 5 for skincare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great thing about this cleanser is that it does seem to brighten the skin.  After my first use I noticed that my skin looked brighter- probably because I was getting make-up out of my pores for the first time (until now I just used cleansers like Cetaphil)!</li>
    <li> This works great as part of my skincare routine. It also took off my daughter&#x27;s temporary tattoo easier than soap and water usually does.</li>
    <li> This is amazing! I use this to take off my make up at night before cleansing. It smells amazing and it makes your skin look really nice and bright once you wash it off. I&#x27;ll be buying another one for sure.</li>
    <li> love this rice oil cleanser. It removes all the makeup very nicely. So far I haven&#x27;t broken out yet. After remove my makeup with this, then rinse off with warm water. I then use Shiseido Fitit Naturgo Sea Mineral Clay Facial Foam to clean the rest of the makeup.  Then, I use Laneige Multi Cleanser last.  This helps me to stay clear of pimples. :)</li>
    <li> the fragrance is a bit too strong and perfum-y for my liking and honestly burns my eyes a little bit when I rinse it off. didn&#x27;t experience any troubles on my skin, but i didn&#x27;t feel any upsides to using this either.</li>
    <li> BEST I HAVE BOUGHT YET</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it seriously burns if you get it in your eyes! But I know they have one just for eyes and lips. I&#x27;m buying innisfree olive oil cleansing sheets for my eyes and lips and just using this on my face.</li>
    <li> I have been using The face shop rice water for 3 years and I can&#x27;t believe I have never written a review. I cannot rave enough about this product I was introduced to it as a gift from a friend and it has been a staple since. I use it to take off make up and/ or before cleansing my face in the morning and my face has thanked me since. I alternate this with coconut oil but I noticed that with continuous use your face will look lighter and brighter</li>
    <li> The scent is nice. The oil itself is very gentle and light. I massage it into my skin and rinse with water. It leaves my skin super soft. I do not use a ton of face makeup, only eye makeup, but it does a good job at removing my waterproof mascara. This cleanser is good for dry skin and combination skin. My only complaint is that the consistency is a bit too watery.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and this works very well to remove my makeup. I use full coverage makeup as I have acne scarring, and this does a very good job of breaking down the makeup and rinses off easily. I use a foaming cleanser after, as I always double cleanses, but this oil cleaner leaves my skin feeling very smooth.</li>
    <li> The one thing I will say about this is that it does clean your skin and its very light. Not exactly what I needed for the winter months, I need extra moisture during the winter. Would be good for medium skin type.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have dry skin, but this is an excellent make up remover. It breaks up foundation and eye make up quickly. Then I rinse and do my regular wash with the foaming cleanser from this same line. Love it. By the time I get to my toner, there&#x27;s no make up left on the cotton. Pump slow cause a lot can come out at once</li>
    <li> Cleans the tough make-up like a champ! It burns the eyes a little though. It is after all a very good product. Glad I found it and am using it. Just ordered another one.</li>
    <li> Great for a prewash. Removes all traces of makeup and moisturizes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but I prefer Banila Co. Clean It. The Face Shop oil cleanser feels nice and leaves your face feeling wonderful, however I&#x27;ve noticed it doesn&#x27;t cut through my makeup as well as Banila, so I always find myself reaching for the Banila over this. If you use makeup remover wipes for your eye makeup before washing your face with this product, you&#x27;ll be very happy with this. If you don&#x27;t, you may have to go over your racoon eyes a couple of more times.</li>
    <li> This is an amazingly great product for the skin. It treats oily skin with oil by gently coaxing blackheads out; it balances out combination skin; and finally, it moisturizes the heck out of dry, parched skin, and it even works as a makeup remover!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is like the Rainbow Unicorn Kitten of facial cleansers- but it really exists. I&#x27;d heard about using facial oil cleansers such as Decleor awhile ago, but I was a bit skeptical. However, in the middle of this harsh winter where we lost our plumbing for two weeks, my skin rebelled. Once it was back on, I decided to treat it to this gentle cleanser instead of soap. It really worked a treat! I&#x27;m able to be seen in daylight &amp; in public once again (no more paper bag!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this solved my dry winter skin problem without any extra lotion- impressive. And it washes my skin daily. I simply wipe away any oily residue with a washcloth. My skin feels clean &amp; moisturized. I do wish this product came in s foam, though. It squirts out, and I only need a teaspoon. A foaming cleanser would be easier to manipulate. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, AmAzon!</li>
    <li> Wow, this is a great stuff. Oil removes every trace of my waterproof mascara but it&#x27;s still super light weight and rinses off easily. This is my new favorite face wash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well packaged and arrived in expected time frame (takes a while if you&#x27;re in the US as mine was shipped from Korea)</li>
    <li> this does a great job removing makeup and sunscreen. doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily or dry. love this product!</li>
    <li> Great product! Good Smell</li>
    <li> I so want to love this.  It smells good.  It cleans my face.  It leaves my skin soft.  But I broke out on my chin every time I used it.  I tried to make every excuse for the breakout (I even went so far as wiping down all of my phone receivers with rubbing alcohol to kill bacteria).  After two weeks of trial and error this is the clear culprit.  To say I am disappointed is an understatement.  I have friends who have used this for years and sweat by it (the reason I tried it in the first place).  I don&#x27;t have overly sensitive skin so this is really shocking.  Who knows - give it a try!</li>
    <li> The only complaint I have is it doesn&#x27;t 100% remove my eyeliner lol&lt;br /&gt;I usually have to use makeup remover then this for it to be completely removed but it is because I wear lots of eyeliner&lt;br /&gt;However... I love all products that use Rice as an ingredient!!! I love how it is soft on your skin and the feeling after you use this. I will purchase this again :)</li>
    <li> Feels good, but it stings my eyes, I prefer the innisfree apple cleansing oil. Doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes and removes makeup pretty well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fine, I guess.  The smell is too perfumey for me, and I don&#x27;t like the runny consistency.  But because I can never just ditch something without finishing it unless it&#x27;s giving me a major allergic reaction or something, I&#x27;ll finish the bottle.  I&#x27;ll be trying something with a thicker consistency next.</li>
    <li> Nice smell (not too strong), leaves the skin very soft</li>
    <li> Lighter than Boscia, a bit strongly scented but still nice, I do get some eye stinging though. Otherwise, if not using for eye make up removal it&#x27;s excellent for face make up remover. I put a pump in my hand to cleanse, then rinse, then do another pump for facial massage as seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;CdkgqXBXprY</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS CLEANSING OIL!!! 😍 It&#x27;s perfect for my oily skin and removes ALL my makeup without leaving any residue behind. Even removes my mascara andg waterproof eyeliner.. so that&#x27;s impressive to me!</li>
    <li> Very nice, gentle product!  Melts even my most stubborn mascara (i.e. Benefit&#x27;s &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real Mascara&amp;#34;) right off!  I use this as step 1 as part of a double cleansing method and can really tell the difference in terms of how much makeup is leftover after cleansing/how clean my skin feels if I do not use this product!  It does tend to sting a little if it gets into your eyes, so you&#x27;ll want to be careful, but it&#x27;s nothing so bad I&#x27;d want to stop using this.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff.  My skin is combination so some of the other oil cleansers made me feel like I was painting goop onto my face but this cleanser is light enough that is still takes off my eye makeup and leaves my skin soft without that masky feeling.  Plus it smells wonderful.  Good product.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used this product, and color me &amp;#34;impressed&amp;#34;. I have always doubted ads when they say they are a moisturizing cleanser, but they completely remove makeup. A friend suggested this, and, since it&#x27;s so reasonably priced, I decided to give it a shot. I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks, and I have to say- it does a superb job. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, leaves it feeling soft, but - the best part- it removes my makeup on the first try, even waterproof mascara.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a while since a product earned my absolute loyalty. I will definitely keep purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;It is really thin, but I dispense it directly into my palm, disperse it on my fingers, and rub it in gently. My friend thinks they have a &amp;#34;foaming&amp;#34; version. I may look for that, but, if I can&#x27;t find it,  I&#x27;m sticking with this.</li>
    <li> I use this as a makeup remover. It is much more gentle than face wipes. I will sometimes need to use an additional eye makeup remover for certain mascaras and liquid eyeliner but have only needed to do that a couple of times. I use one pump, rub it over my face and gradually add water to rinse it off. I follow-up with a facial cleanser, toner, moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I used this to remove my makeup, and it did a perfect job.  I wear waterproof mascara every day, and it&#x27;s usually really hard to remove, but this oil made it super easy.</li>
    <li> Tried it in a sampler and like it so i decide to purchase one. It was good but not recomended to use everyday. Maybe twice a week is fine</li>
    <li> Good for the first step of double cleansing, very light in texture and glides  into the skin easily. I only wear sunscreen, no makeup, so I cannot speak for its makeup removal effectiveness, but the sunscreens I wear are removed easily. There is no mineral oil in product, a good thing if you have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For sebaceous filaments (rough skin/bumpy pores on the nose), rubbing this gently onto them removes the excess sebum and makes skin feel smooth and clean again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally this is not my favorite cleansing oil, but it does its job and is more affordable than others. If you are looking for something more nourishing and moisturizing, try the famous DHC olive oil cleanser or HABA Squa Cleansing.</li>
    <li> Really enjoying this lightweight oil. Who would have thought this could be used to wash eye makeup &amp; the skin? Very pleasant aroma to boot. Sometimes, I still add a different brand of skin cleanser when I want a very thorough washing of the face.</li>
    <li> Smell sooo nice, and does its job of cleansing very well! Will buy again!!</li>
    <li> It has a light oily texture with non-irritating floral scent, and I usually use two pumps at a time. It makes my face appear brighter after use, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few weeks now. I used to use the Kose Softymo Deep Cleansing Oil to take off my everyday makeup, but decided to try this The Face Shop Rice Water Bright Cleansing Light Oil. It works very well - gets rid of all of my makeup, including waterproof mascara. I pump directly onto my hands, rub/massage all over my face (including eye makeup areas), and rinse with water. I have oily/combination skin, so a lot of products makes me break out, but this does not. I usually also use a foam cleanser after this, due to my skin type, but I know plenty of people that don&#x27;t use a foam cleanser after an oil cleanser. I would buy it again and highly recommend this to anyone looking to completely take off all your makeup (even without using eye makeup remover). It has a very light scent that I like as well. Shipping was very fast.</li>
    <li> I switched from OCM (my own mix) to this for the cost and ease, as I couldn&#x27;t quite get my mix right. This stuff is a miracle! It goes on so smoothly and rub into a silky texture. Removes dirt and makeup without drying out skin. I will be re-buying this once I run out!</li>
    <li> Love it, it was light and freshly scented</li>
    <li> Face feels so good after using this product. I love to use it at night to give my face a silky feeling</li>
    <li> This smells GREAT! It really does work well to clean ALL of my makeup off, including my eyes. My skin feels so soft after I wash with this face oil. I have recently been introduced to the double cleanse concept. I wash my face with the foaming wash of the same brand after I clean my face with this cleansing oil to completely clean my face at the end of every day. I use an oil cleanser to remove oil based debris- sebum, makeup, sunscreen. I use a foaming wash afterwards to remove water based debris- sweat and dirt. My face is squeaky clean when I walk out of the shower- no more raccoon eyes.</li>
    <li> Face shop is like a God sent , always amazing me</li>
    <li> Bought this solely to take my makeup off because I felt like makeup wipes were too abrasive and these worked way better than any makeup wipes I&#x27;ve ever used. Took off all of my makeup (barely any residue when I wiped my face with toner) and cleansed my faced real well, but it was still really gentle which is good if you have sensitive skin. I recommend this for all skin types</li>
    <li> This is my first oil cleanser.  I am very adventurous with skin care products so I was excited to try it, and I had a feeling it would work out well.  It has exceeded my expectations!  I noticed that a previous reviewer said to massage the oil all over your dry face for a while, then add in some water and massage some more.  I did exactly that, and I loved the way it felt and smelled because it felt very luxurious and smooth going on, and smelled faintly like a nice perfume.  very nice face washing experience.  I rinsed multiple times with water and my face felt smooth, soft, and clean afterwards.  I used a cotton ball with toner afterwards and noticed there was a faint trace of foundation on the cotton ball, but not much.  I decided that because of this I will do like many others have done and do the &amp;#34;double cleansing method&amp;#34; by using a foaming cleanser afterwards.  I purchased &amp;#34;Shiseido Perfect Whip&amp;#34; face wash, which is also on Amazon, and has a cult following I suppose.  (But my experience with this face wash is a different story for a different review). I&#x27;ll probably end up using Cerave foaming facewash after this oil, because I have read that it is a good one to use with the double cleansing method after oil.  Anyways, I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase, it feels very nice and rich, and makes your skin soft and moisturized.  Also, I&#x27;m acne prone and it is helping heal some pimples.</li>
    <li> Not for sensitive skin. I used it once and my face started burning and got all red and blotchy a few minuets afterward.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used 2 other oil cleansers and thought I would try this one.  It really doesn&#x27;t remove my mascara and eye makeup well so I end up a smudgy mess instead of having clean eyes with this oil cleanser.  Apparently it has too much water and not enough oil. I am quite disappointed with it as a cleanser and I won&#x27;t reorder.</li>
    <li> This oil does take off make-up, but I don&#x27;t like the fragrance or the texture. This is decent enough, but I&#x27;m definitely going to try another product to double cleanse with.</li>
    <li> So far so good! I worked this into my, now, 8 step evening product extravaganza and it works well</li>
    <li> Love it. I have acne prone skin and after many years of trying different kinds of medication my skin is dry. The oil helps to moisturize it. Also, at the end of the day, I have little build-ups in my skin, after massaging the oil into my skin, most of the build-ups are removed and my skin is softer. I recommend it. It also does well to remove my makeup!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing! As someone with combination-oily skin, this stuff works like a charm. It&#x27;s light and watery enough to not clog my pores and over saturate my skin with oil, it also settles nicely into the skin after washing it off, leaving it soft and fresh. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin&#x27;s complexion has evened out and it looks much brighter and healthier.</li>
    <li> Works well on a face full of makeup.  The scent can be overwhelming.  I&#x27;ve been using it long enough to thankfully be nose blind.  Will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> First time using an oil cleanser, works insanely well and doesn&#x27;t leave your face oily or greasy--mine felt softer and clearer after use.</li>
    <li> I bought this cleanser from an actual The Face Shop store in America. It costs around $16 including tax. I have to say that I&#x27;m so disappointed in this cleanser. The size you get is very little for the amount. Even with the cheaper price on Amazon at ~$12 including shipping, it&#x27;s a very small amount. I mainly got this cleanser because I needed something to take off my makeup and my super hard to remove sunscreen. It does the job at that. However, you&#x27;ll need quite a bit of product to work around your face. The product is very runny. It feels like oil but very thin oil as well as watery. The product has this floral soapy smell. It rinses completely off but it also leaves a film residue on your skin. It&#x27;s that residue that creates friction if you were to run your fingers across your face. I also like that this product doesn&#x27;t contain any mineral oil unlike all the other Face Shop oil cleanser. My toner pad was completely clear of makeup when I used it after I used this cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the other things was enough for me to look into other oil cleansers. I discovered reviews about the DHC oil cleanser. I&#x27;ve heard of it before but never looked into. I&#x27;m glad I did because it has even better ingredients than this cleanser. It is olive oil based and it washes off cleanly without that residue feeling. It may seem more expensive but you get more product for the price. The DHC cleanser is also scentless and it&#x27;s thicker so you end up using less product. It&#x27;s also easily accessible through Amazon&#x27;s free shipping selection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this product but there&#x27;s too many cons for me. I highly recommend the DHC oil cleanser instead.</li>
    <li> My favorite oil cleanser. Great at removing makeup. I use it before my regular foaming face cleanser.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be thicker like an oil but it is actually more watery? in consistency which I actually think is better. Removes makeup really well even my waterproof mascara and I have dry/combination skin but it left my skin really soft and moisturised after using it. I use 1-2 pumps for my face and neck. I also notice I get less spots after using it for 1/2 weeks. I would buy this product again~</li>
    <li> I just started the Korean 10 step skin care regimen and I am really happy with the results. The oil cleanser is very light and smells great. I use it twice a day and follow with the foaming cleanser. If you buy this product you will be very pleased. I don&#x27;t wear much makeup so I cannot say how well it does removing heavy foundation and eye makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m totally converted to oil + foam cleansers. I made the switch after having a bad allergic reaction to another unrelated product and not only is this much gentler on my skin (I pair it with Skin Food&#x27;s Foam cleanser at night), but it makes taking off makeup a breeze. There is no scent and the act of putting it on is pretty relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin, I recommend making the switch to oil + foaming cleanser. My skin is so much happier for the switch.</li>
    <li> Feels nice and smooth on the skin</li>
    <li> This is nice! It&#x27;s very light and almost looks like water in the bottle but feels like a really light, silky oil when pumped into the hands. The lather is very nice and it didn&#x27;t overly strip my face even when followed with my foaming cleanser. I didn&#x27;t notice a super strong scent. It didn&#x27;t dribble down my hands and arms a terrible amount while washing which is nice, too. It looks cute next to all of my other stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time will tell if this will break me out. The only con is its small size but it seems that most oil cleansers come in a small amount. I will be trying Kose Softymo next depending on how much I like this. Heard good things about DHC but that price...No thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update when i test it against other things besides just my bare face...like makeup and japanese sunscreen! mwahaha.</li>
    <li> This product was highly recommended for oil based face cleansers. I do enjoy using it, but there are a few cons: does not completely remove all of my waterproof makeup...it gets my sink really messy...and my hands feel very oily after I use it. Nevertheless, overall it is a good product for its price. I&#x27;m not sure if I would purchase again due to the messiness.</li>
    <li> Not sure what the hype is about on this one. This works okay, but it didn&#x27;t remove my mascara. I know oil cleansers aren&#x27;t required to remove point make up, but if a cleanser can&#x27;t remove my non-waterproof mascara after it&#x27;s been rubbed into my eyelashes? I don&#x27;t trust that it&#x27;s getting my face clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a plus, it didn&#x27;t leave any residue, and it played well with my foaming cleanser. It emulsified well, but not outstandingly well. It also didn&#x27;t dry my face. When I left it on my face for a little while, I&#x27;d get a grit or two. Still, no mascara removal? Not for me. If you use a separate point makeup remover, this might be what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> Does it take off all your makeup? Yes. But, for me, I could not get over the OVERWHELMING SMELL. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m washing my face with a strong perfume. Thought I&#x27;d give this a try since it&#x27;s cheaper than the DHC oil I&#x27;ve been using. Conclusion: stick to DHC Cleansing Oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this product is great for many people. However, I need to warn anyone prone to closed comedones. Note that most people are not prone to closed comedones (CCs), so if this is not an issue for you, feel free to ignore this warning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product for about 2 weeks before I broke out in CCs all over my chin and cheeks and spread rapidly. I kept using this for 2 months because I didn&#x27;t realize that this was the culprit (a cleansing item causing breakouts? I thought it didn&#x27;t make sense!) but upon stopping this cleanser, my CCs immediately stopped appearing.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this for oily or combination skin. It cleans really well and melts all the makeup but made me breakout.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I give myself a face message while rubbing the makeup off it. I use this and the cleanser and it feels like I removed all my makeup.</li>
    <li> LOVE ITTTT! It makes a huge difference when you wash your face with this oil first and then a foam cleanser. I have dry, sensitive skin and it has loved this product!^^</li>
    <li> Really light! It cleans my skin really well. The makeup completely comes off and I love how it&#x27;s more on the watery side rather than oil. I love this cleansing oil.</li>
    <li> I was so nervous about using oil on my face.  I was raised in the era that oil in your cosmetics, cleaning stuff, etc was the worst thing you could do to cause more breakouts.  I have suffered with acne for geez 20 years now.  This oil is light, clean smelling and removes all the gunk that causes you to break out in one swoop.  I think that my skin so needed the extra moisture and using  now has balanced my skin in a way that I never expected.  I have spent so much money on high-cost face creams and cleansers and this does more than they ever had.&lt;br /&gt;I use it as the first step in my nightly facial/cleansing- followed by a mild cleanser with a clarasonic.  I know when I am done, the day&#x27;s make-up, dirt, pollution, all the bad stuff is gone.  I also have used it on my young daughters to remove their attempt at putting &amp;#34;make-up&amp;#34; on using markers. The oil took off their red marker lipstick and black eyebrow in one swipe.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> Melts and takes off my make up easily. Sometimes I use foaming cleanser after this. Pleasant smell, doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out. I like this product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the Innisfree oil facial wipes...those are actually my go-to. But I keep this in my closet for when I run out of wipes. This works well and makes my face feel nice and soft and clean. It&#x27;s really just a preference whether you like the larger wipes or if you don&#x27;t mind squirting this onto the little cotton pads. Overall, a good product and doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out. Thoroughly removes my makeup and combines well with my other skin care products.</li>
    <li> Pros: Soothing, not oily, no residue, leaves face feeling moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Very thin liquid shoot out all at once with one pump and run between fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Press very slowly and try to keep most of it  :-)  Pleasant mild scent that does not bother my sensisitve skin.</li>
    <li> works very well. the first time i used it i massaged my face for about two minutes, rinsed it off and my face had a nice glow. i&#x27;ve been using it for about two months now, every morning and night. my face has kepted the glow. it also takes off my makeup very good too. i only ever wear a bb cream, but even when i doll myself up it gets most of it and then my fase wash gets the rest.</li>
    <li> great product! it does make the face soft and moisturize.</li>
    <li> removes makeup very well and i finish with tissues and it removes most of make up on my face. I wear makeup very thin and this product is great for me :D</li>
    <li> This does a decent job at removing my makeup, but it burns my eyes something serious. My eyes sometimes bother me for a few hours after. It doesn&#x27;t do a great job removing my eye makeup either.  I will finish this up, but won&#x27;t repurchase because the burning sensation it causes my eyes. I would like to mention that even if I don&#x27;t use it to take my eye makeup off it still tends to burn.</li>
    <li> This product is gentle but really effective at removing makeup. It&#x27;s helped me to be more gentle with my skin because no scrubbing is necessary. It also smells really nice. I follow this oil cleanser with Super Aqua foaming cleanser (Missha) and really enjoy using the products together. You can&#x27;t beat the price on this, either!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a first step cleanser to remove my make-up and oil that have built up throughout the day then I follow up with a gentle foam cleanser.  I have combination/oily and sensitive skin and this product has worked well for me.  I like the fragrance as well.  Those with dry skin may not have to follow up with a foam cleanser.  I like to wash my face twice at night, once to get the make-up/dirt/oil from the day, then a second time to clean the skin.</li>
    <li> I really love this cleansing oil. It gets off any leftover makeup or residue, has a nice fresh scent, didn&#x27;t irritate my skin and left it feeling soft. Just one squirt of this oil covers your face and neck, so it really goes a long way. It makes my skin look/feel healthier; I would definitely recommend this to a friend!</li>
    <li> This came a little earlier than it was supposed to. I accidentally ordered two, but it is great. It does not dry my skin out, it does its job really well. My skin feels soft afterwards :) it is definitely worth the money and time!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Now that it&#x27;s the cold weather season, my combination skin dries out quite a bit. Following some advice I read, I&#x27;ve started using this cleansing oil and follow it with a gentle foaming cleanser. When I&#x27;m done, some of the moisture from the cleansing oil is left on my skin but my skin feels clean. I should also note that I have sensitive skin prone to breakouts. I haven&#x27;t had any problems I attribute to the new routine. I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
    <li> I was going on a trip to Korea and researched the best Korean cosmetic products to try/purchase. I found this in a shop while I was over and fell in love! It takes off the absolute most ridiculous waterproof makeup and leaves your skin feeling incredibly soft and clean. You won&#x27;t get a squeaky type of clean (which means you&#x27;ve overdone it), it&#x27;s just void of all makeup, dirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pump once into my dry hands and face and use that oil to massage my whole face, starting with my forehead, cheeks, nose and chin. Then I press the oil into my eyes lash area, and you&#x27;ll definitely look like a panda if you wear a ton of eye makeup like myself. Then you take regular water and wash your face normally. The &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; comes off with all of your  makeup. It really works better than any make up cleanser I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve used a lot (Estee Lauder, Clinique, Lancome, to Neutroegna, Target&#x27;s Up and Up) and this is single handedly the best product ever. I&#x27;ve never seen any other makeup remover take away my eye makeup like this one. Now, I order through Amazon since even going to the actual FaceShop in America is more expensive than their prices here.</li>
    <li> This stuffs great!  It takes my waterproof eyeliner and mascara off with ease.  It only takes one pump to get my entire face with it and half a pump if you only want to get your eyes.  I also really like that it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes at all like some eye make up removers do.  I only use this at night so I&#x27;m not sure how it would be under make up (although I don&#x27;t think you probably need to use it in the morning unless you slept in your make up...).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this oil! I apply it first to a dry face. It removes most, if not all, of my make-up with gentle use (no scrubbing). The product has a nice light scent too. I follow up with a neutrogena cleansing gel with my Clarisonic brush. My face is clean and soft and the dark spots of summer seem to be fading away. Super happy and will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> I like to use this on my face before cleansing. It takes everything out! The only issue it that is burns my eyes afterwards.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and I use this to remove my makeup, which clings to me like a second skin.  This is a light oil and probably not emollient enough for people with dry skin.  This removes even my waterproof mascara and it only takes a single pump to cleanse my whole face.  I then use Clinique&#x27;s foaming face wash to remove the oil.  It&#x27;s a two step process but I can be assured that all makeup has been removed.  I also use a washcloth with the face wash to ensure that it removes every last trace of the oil.  For those with drier skin, a toner would work instead of face wash.  The oil has to be eliminated in order for serums and face creams to penetrate and do their work.  I definitely recommend this oil to anyone who wants a lighter formulation with much less greasiness than a heavier oil.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product, it does what it says, is gentle to the skin and does not leave it oily after using. It leaves the skin as soft as a newborn babies skin :) ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with a &amp;#34;light oil&amp;#34;, but took a chance because of the excellent reviews.  I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this purchase. I have dryish skin, and this oil does a great job of cleansing thoroughly but keeping moisture in my skin.  Its summer now, but I can&#x27;t wait to use this in the winter.  I will be repurchasing.  Bought at a great price here, as there are no Face Shops local to me, but I&#x27;ve bought a few things while traveling and have been very pleased with all their products so far.</li>
    <li> This works fantastic at getting off makeup, especially stubborn eye makeup. That&#x27;s what I mainly use this product for, but it&#x27;s also a good cleanser! If you want to double-cleanse (see the Korean skincare routine) this is a great oil-based cleaner. It makes your skin feel so soft and supple</li>
    <li> Will buy again. I use it before my other cleanser to help take off some of my makeup easier. I&#x27;d use plain too but I still have my old cleanser I&#x27;m going through first. I love this product. It&#x27;s so smooth and nice on my face. Keeps my face from being dry and flaky after washing my face.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this that often. If my face feels kind of meh when I get home, I&#x27;ll use this to clean it. It is refreshing, and my skin will get a bit glowy. I like the smell as well.</li>
    <li> What a great cleanser!  It does feel oily on your skin, but washes right off with water leaving your skin feel hydrated and clean.  Would definitely recommend for those with oily or combination skin.  It has helped clear up my face.  If your on the fence about it, don&#x27;t be and get it!</li>
    <li> Removes makeup well and doesn&#x27;t make my oily skin oiler. I have not experienced a breakout from it. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and it&#x27;s replaced harsh makeup wipes!</li>
    <li> It gets the job done but barely. I do not recommend this for people with dry skin. Might be better off with a more expensive cleansing oil. I&#x27;m personally going to switch over to banila&#x27;s cleanser. It has more moisture retaining qualities.</li>
    <li> smells nice and moisturizes very well :) 10/10 would buy again</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this. I haven&#x27;t had as many break-outs and my skin feels fantastic. I really like the smell, too. I have combination skin so I didn&#x27;t know if slathering oil on it would be a good solution but it has been the best decision for me and my skin.</li>
    <li> Not real thrilled with this cleanser but it is ok.  It smells wonderful and does leave a nice light oil on your face.  I wish I could read the label and know what is in it though. It is made in Korea and I cannot read the language.</li>
    <li> So I wear paris atelier gel foundation which is super water proof like it doesnt even come off with my lancer cleanser or any water when i take a show, this stuff did really good taking it off, i feel like my skin has been getting a little dry because of all the korean skin care products i put on it but still i really like it, it has a really perfumey smell but i also have a sensitive nose.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I use it to remove all my makeup and then follow with my regular foaming cleanser. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or break me out at all, and it&#x27;s moisturizing without feeling heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is its unusual smell. The first whiff smells pretty good, kind of a light artificial fruity-floral type scent. But once that initial moment passes there&#x27;s a weird lingering odor. It seems like the nice fragrance was added to cover it up, but it&#x27;s still noticeable. Luckily the smell fades quickly once the oil has been washed off.</li>
    <li> Best facial cleanser ever!  Little amount of product goes a long way leaving my face so soft.  It removes all my makeup even my mascara.</li>
    <li> Will repurchase...now a permanent part of my nightly  beauty routine</li>
    <li> Great for taking off makeup, especially difficult to remove eye makeup.. Just make sure you have a moisturizer handy. It dries out your face pretty quickly. Also when I received it the nozzle was broken off so be careful to check when you receive it!</li>
    <li> I use this as a makeup remover and it is unbelievable. The oil is very slippery and has a wonderful light scent. It cleans everything off without any difficulty. I love this product and will buy more :)</li>
    <li> Remove makeup easily due to the natural oil.  But, I am oily skin type so I&#x27;m a bit not comfortable with the smooth oily feel on the skin touch after every wash.  So maybe use this during winter time or living in very cold dry season.</li>
    <li> Cleans nicely. Scentless. Part of my nightly routine. It gets off any remaining make-up that my charcoal soap rinse doesn&#x27;t. My skin tone is more even, but I can&#x27;t definitively attribute it to this product since I&#x27;ve started a routine that involves multiple products.</li>
    <li> Smells really nice! Takes off all of my make up which I usually prime my face, use foundation, concealer, and pressed powder. Eyeliners and everything else came off very easy. Be careful when using near the eyes though it kind of burns.</li>
    <li> this product is just ok. I purchased it after reading positive reviews but i personally don&#x27;t like it a lot. i have a really sensitive skin and good thing about this product it it didn&#x27;t cause break out.</li>
    <li> The product itself is wonderful! I unfortunately wear alot of makeup because of a birthmark and removing my makeup is a pain. I use this once (one pump) and smooth all over and makeup is almost all gone! Amazing! Its by far the best makeup remover Ive found, Ive tried many! The only reason I didnt like was the delivery time which took a little while but on a brighter note, received it way ahead of schedule, 2 weeks!</li>
    <li> Love it! smells awesome and it removes everything on my skin :) im happy with it!</li>
    <li> This has to be one of the best cleansers I have purchased in my almost 70 years. I only wish I knew about it in my teens, and that is why I have my&lt;br /&gt;12 year old granddaughter using it to save her beautiful skin now and not suffer the way I did in my teens and most of my lifetime. This will also save her a lot of time and money trying everything out there. . Make sure if you purchase it to read reviews because it&#x27;s not in English on bottle. It&#x27;s very simple just use it like soap and make sure you put enough on and keep rubbing in circles until you see and feel white particles, this is your&lt;br /&gt;Dead skin. Your face will feel like silk after and I use it 3 times a week.This is a first time results product and now I see why Japanese women don&#x27;t have a blemish on them. After this I use Maroc 100 Flight Cream also purchased on Amazon and is so wonderful feeling you will GLOW ! Both are so&lt;br /&gt;economical  you too will be surprised of cost and results, no more fancy names and outrageous prices I PROMISE !!</li>
    <li> I freaking love this stuff! It is super gentle, tightens up my pores, smells great and removes my waterproof mascara. My face feels silky smooth with a matte finish after I wash it off. I usually follow up with the Peach Sake Emulsion by Skin Food (which seems to absorb better if I use it directly after rinsing off the cleanser). A little bit of this stuff goes a long way. A half pump is plenty for your face. I have had it for a couple months, use it almost every day and I haven&#x27;t reached the halfway point in the bottle. 10/10 would buy again.</li>
    <li> It is rare for me to write a negative review. I almost always do a lot of research before buying an item and rely on others&#x27; reviews. This product was well liked by many others, but it&#x27;s not for me.  I have used DHC Cleanser (love it, but it&#x27;s pricey) and Kose Softymo Deep Cleansing Oil (love it almost as much as DHC, it&#x27;s a little more watery, but it&#x27;s also cheaper than DHC.). I thought I&#x27;d try this one to see if it&#x27;s a happy medium between the two.  The thing I hate the most about it is that when I put it on and mix with some water it turns into a gummy feel on my face. I&#x27;m generally not a super particular person regarding texture, but I find this oil  to be unpleasant to work with. I also find it does not remove my mascara completely and I&#x27;ve had to use a Q-tip after each wash to get the last bit off. I also have to wash my face a second time when using this oil to get rid of the residue feeling.  Sorry, this product is just not a winner for me. I&#x27;m actually throwing it out and have just ordered another bottle of the Kose product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. I use it before my foaming face wash. My skin is now clearer, softer, and happier :) Plus, you can&#x27;t beat the price! Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> This oil is light and doesn&#x27;t sit heavy on the skin. It even lathers up just a little (you can see the white film/slight froth), which I like. I prefer using it with my fingers instead of the konjac sponge, but that&#x27;s just me. When my skin freaks out and gets greasy, this oil helps bring it all back under control. It&#x27;s fantastic and gives me a light dewy finish and leaves my skin feeling well moisturized and clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin so I’m always on the hunt for an inexpensive facial cleansing oil.  This was my least favorite out of all the ones I have tried thus far. The smell is light and it does take makeup off as others do, the problem I have with it is that when I wash off with water, I still feel a greasy film on my skin.  The oil technically should be emulsified completely.  Now I’m just trying to finish it up so I don’t waste it, but I have to follow with a toner to get that film off.  If you are on the market, DHC offers a great one. If you are looking for a cheaper alternative, Garnier makes a great one also (minus the typical strong Garnier scent). So far, I’ve tried probably 10 of Face Shop’s products (a lot of masks) and I have to say, I’m just not impressed.  They basically don’t do anything for my skin despite the hype and cute packaging. I think this will be my last FS purchase.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! like a watermelon lollipop - is in the sweeter side.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never tried a cleansing oil before, and it suits my skin really good (normal/ combination skin type).&lt;br /&gt;It wipes all my makeup away and after rinsed it my skin feels really moisturized without the oiliness, and with 1-2 pumps you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I tried a cleansing oil, and this product is very good. It melts all of my makeup right away and does not leave a greasy residue. I have sensitive skin and I get acne from certain products, but this cleansing oil has not given me any irritation. The shipping is fast and I had no problems. Will probably buy this again.</li>
    <li> I am surprised with this product. At first use I thought it was going to leave my skin oily, but no. Washes off with water, leaves skin perfect and clean. I&#x27;m very pleased and will recommend it.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough great things about this cleanser.  It&#x27;s SUPER gentle for your skin and it has a nice smell to it.  It leaves my skin extremely soft and glowing.  Makeup comes off so easily with this.  I use this when I wash my face at my bathroom sink and whenever I remember to bring it in the shower with me.  I didn&#x27;t realize how well this works until I forgot to bring it in the shower with me last night and had to use cetaphil instead.  After I got out of the shower and looked in the mirror, I still saw mascara residue around the bottoms of my eyes.  The Rice water bright cleansing oil doesn&#x27;t leave any makeup behind so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it.  I also feel that this is even more gentle on my skin than cetaphil...which is known for it&#x27;s gentleness. I LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> It takes off all my makeup completely before I use my foam cleanser. I love it!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Takes off waterproof makeup really well.</li>
    <li> Works to get off any bit of excess make up, and does not bother my sensitive skin. Works well to help combat my dryness.</li>
    <li> I love this! It takes my makeup off so well and my sunscreen. I can see the white products from my sunscreen come off when I am using this product. When I can see that the products that I have on my face come off onto my hands as I am scrubbing the oil on my face, that is when I know that this is a great product. I also like that it is so light and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy like the coconut oil that I use to take my make up off. It also doesn&#x27;t leave my face feel like a grease ball which is great! The one thing that I do not like about this product is that it stings if it gets into my eyes.</li>
    <li> This wash helps take off my makeup and smells so good.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually bother with face cleansing products and only rinse my face with water because I&#x27;m happy with my skin and products tend to aggravate my skin (well, I&#x27;m lazy as well), but this cleansing oil is serious business. I have normal-combination skin and it&#x27;s been really great for my dryer skin this winter without making my skin oily. It also doesn&#x27;t make my skin itch or breakout. I just use two pumps of the oil, warm it between my hands, and massage into my face. I then follow with a Cetaphil cleanser. Together they make a really effective skincare routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use a makeup remover and/or face cleanser, I would still have mascara and eyeliner left behind which made me look like a raccoon. However, when I use the cleansing oil and a cleanser, there is no leftover eye makeup. The smell is also very light and pleasant so it doesn&#x27;t bother me. I am very much a believer in oil cleansing now!</li>
    <li> I heard so many great things about this oil cleanser.  I like it, but I don&#x27;t think it works as well as Ponds cold cream.  It is much easier to work with than Ponds, but doesn&#x27;t get all the makeup off.  It&#x27;s not expensive, so it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try it and since I use a cleanser after I use this, it&#x27;s only a prep tool before I deep clean.  I will probably try another oil before purchasing this again, but I really like the price on this.  It does last along time using only one squirt to cover my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month along with some other products and my face has cleared up so much. It got here in about 4 days which I didn&#x27;t think was bad and everything was just as it was describbed. I would recommend this for anyone looking to try, that&#x27;s looking for a new skin care product.</li>
    <li> Its ok i guess. Nothing great. Smells funny.</li>
    <li> Awesome cleansing oil for a great price. It takes all of my make up off and I use this day and night to get rid of the natural oils I have accumulated throughout the day. I will definitely be re-purchasing.</li>
    <li> My cleansing routine is always first with this product to remove makeup and then using foam cleanser afterwards.  I used to use oil cleanser from bobbi brown but this works as great and it&#x27;s cheaper!  For those who have used bobbi brown oil cleanser, this one&#x27;s texture is definitely lighter and watery than bobbi brown.  I prefer the scent from bobbi brown but considering price and value, I would choose this one.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing for normal to dry skin. I don&#x27;t this is recommended for problem and acne prone akin. Will clog pores.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using a cleansing oil, and adding it to my routine, but it removes makeup really well. Despite most people saying that it is not good for removing eye makeup, I think it works great. I wear a lot of mascara and eyeliner, and it removes it with minimal effort. It all just melts away.  This cleansing oil also really does help clear out my face really well, before using it I had a lot of problems with my acne and the first few days after using it(alone, not with my routine) a lot of it went away and my face feels a lot better and fresh.</li>
    <li> I buy so many korean products and i must say, this has helped so much, its faded my dark spots and minimized my acne. AND i just received it last week and i already see results, i would buy more.</li>
    <li> it is cheap and does it work</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little while now. I was so excited to receive it. I really want to love this product but the fragrance is total turn off for me. I really enjoy the thin oil texture. It spreads very nicely. You apply the oil to dry skin and massage in. Then use some water to emulsify the oil and rinse. You then follow up with a foaming cleanser to remove any leftover traces of oil and dirt. That method is following Korean Skincare. I have not noticed any particular brightening after use yet. My skin does feel very soft. The fragrance just isn&#x27;t for me but I&#x27;m sure many others will love it. I will use it till its gone and then look for a new one to try.</li>
    <li> I use this in my double cleansing process. Gets the make off very gently. No negative skin reactions. Only bad thing is that it doesn&#x27;t travel well- I&#x27;d be afraid of spillage.</li>
    <li> I can feel it in my skin already. Gives this oily feeling but it smooths my skin</li>
    <li> I fell in love with product. And the seller shipped within a couple of days even though its from Korea. Trust me, its not a fluke because it was posted from Korea. Anyways, its awesome and cheap! I&#x27;ll continue using it</li>
    <li> I used to have combination, acne-prone skin growing up, but now I have pretty &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin that&#x27;s well-moisturized and maybe a bit on the oily side as the day goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this, and have it be my go-to cleanser but ... it wasn&#x27;t meant to be. I had heard so many good things about exfoliating oil cleansers. I already use a mineral oil cleanser at the end of the day, but I want something that could do everything in one step while I was in the shower. I had heard good things about the Rice Water Bright Cleansing Light Oil, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a week, I wasn&#x27;t over-joyed with it. I use Missha&#x27;s BB Boomer and Missha&#x27;s Perfect Cover BB Cream in my daily make-up routine, but this oil cleanser couldn&#x27;t get it all off. It also had a hard time cutting through my eyeliner (MAC Blacktrack) and mascara (Clinique). Even after a lot of rubbing and exfoliating, there was still make-up residue on my skin, which caused me to break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope I&#x27;ll be able to find a better oil cleanser out there ... they sound amazing. *sigh*</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cleansing oil! I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks and it always makes my skin feel so clean, soft, and fresh. It&#x27;s very gentle but can still do a great job removing your makeup, including waterproof mascara quickly and easily. The smell is pleasant and not too strong. You really don&#x27;t need to use much of this, a little bit goes a long way. I had high expectations for this based off of other reviews and it has exceeded them. I&#x27;ll definitely be repurchasing this when it runs out :)</li>
    <li> Huh. I&#x27;m a little sad that I didn&#x27;t like this product since the reason I got it in the first place was because of all the great reviews. It&#x27;s been almost two months since I purchased this, but I tried to hold out to see if my opinion changed from the initial use. It didn&#x27;t. I tend to be really cautious when it comes to buying new products because I am extremely acne-prone and break out really easily, and my skin is a finicky combination-oily type. The plus to this product is that it didn&#x27;t really break me out. It also comes with a pump which I really like. The packaging is pretty as well, and there is a decent amount of product. I&#x27;m two months into the product as I&#x27;ve said, and I haven&#x27;t hit midway yet (though there may be a negative reason for that). However, these are the only pluses I found, honestly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that bothered me from the onset is that the scent is really, REALLY strong. I&#x27;m normally not too bothered by scented products, but this oil is way too scented. It smells kind of like old grandma, tbh. So if you don&#x27;t like scented products, I don&#x27;t think this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing is that I really advise against putting this oil anywhere near your eyes. My eyes aren&#x27;t too sensitive, but this oil made me literally cry after that first use. I think after repeat use I&#x27;ve gotten a little more used to it, but I&#x27;ve found that I tend to avoid this product for basically this reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third and last thing is that I feel like this product lingers on your skin unless you really take the time to scrub your face. I double cleanse, but I&#x27;ve found that just the amount of effort I have to exert to take the oil off before the second cleanse is annoying. And additionally, I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t really emulsify? Or perhaps since it&#x27;s not as pricey a product as say Clinique&#x27;s Take the Day Off for the face (which has been my go-to for a long time), it&#x27;s just not as high quality? I dunno.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think maybe I was just unlucky and got a bad bottle? Maybe I&#x27;m just the one in the almost two hundred people that it didn&#x27;t do much for? Who knows. Hopefully this was helpful!was just unlucky and got a bad bottle? Maybe I&#x27;m just the one in the almost two hundred people that it didn&#x27;t do much for? Who knows. Hopefully this was helpful!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like other product. I can see the different after 1 use :o &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Ooooh, really like this stuff so far.  Cleans well and does not strip my face and make it feel dry.  Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Worked magic with my sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use as a pre-cleanse/makeup remover.  Smells like horrible old lady perfume--I could get past the smell if it worked well, but it doesn&#x27;t.  Hard on the eyes and irritates my skin (I do not have sensitive skin).  Passible on makeup removal but there are cleansing oils that do this job better that don&#x27;t smell bad, don&#x27;t sting my eyes, and don&#x27;t make my face red and irritated.</li>
    <li> Ive been reviewing the whole korean skincare routine so I decided to buy the first step and try this particular product after seeing the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking at the bottle it is a good amount of product, I cant understand what some negative reviews mean by not enough..One pump and I massage allover my face. The trick is to make sure to rinse off before you wash with second cleanser which is normally a gentle foam one. All of my makeup comes off but the only complaint is the slight sting in the eyes I get from the product. It doesnt happen every time either though just when Im going crazy with the oil and massaging it well on my lashes which isnt needed.</li>
    <li> Gets rid of all of my stubborn eye makeup easily. I never expected an oil to be so great on my oily skin, but this is the perfect first step in my routine. I use twice daily, and my skin feels amazing after. It has even helped with recovering from hormonal acne. Will continue to buy this in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I follow this with Innisfree volcanic foam cleanser and then the rest of my Korean routine.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE.....this stuff gets every last bit of makeup off without drying my skin out.  I ordered another bottle to have one by my sink and one in the shower.  I should have bought 2 more as my 16 year old Daughter keeps &amp;#34;borrowing&amp;#34; it.</li>
    <li> It is OK but feels weird on my face.  I can&#x27;t tell if it drys my face out though.  I will have to use it a couple more times before  I decide.</li>
    <li> This product is great for the first part of your two step cleanse. Use with the cleansing milk too.</li>
    <li> I love, love this product. It met my expectations and then some. I&#x27;d recommend this product! Great</li>
    <li> Irritates my eyes and doesn&#x27;t do a great job getting rid of eye makeup. I should have spent a few more bucks and get DHC or Shiseido. I&#x27;ve used cleansing oil for years and this one is probably the worst.</li>
    <li> I was honestly hesitant getting this because it contains oil, and I have sensitive skin so I was scared that I was gonna break out if I used it. Surprisingly after applying and washing my face, my face felt so smooth. I&#x27;ve been reading about this product for some time now and it seems to always to be in the top charts. Would totally recommend!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this since I read great things about it but I ended up returning it. I would put it on my face and then wet my hands &amp; emulsify it like others said. I don&#x27;t really like how it feels when it is &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34; my face. I would use a foaming face wash to make sure I get it all off. I started getting these small pimples all over my face so I stopped. Some reviews where they look at the ingredients indicate that there things in there to clog your skin, so be careful</li>
    <li> I love the product it is great and leaves my skin soft and a noticeable brightness to my complexion after I wash:). Will definitely repurchase when I run out.</li>
    <li> So amazing!! Will purchase again!&lt;br /&gt;Just 2 pumps, one on each side of my face, I massage everywhere for about 1 minute and rinse off my face in warm water, ALL of my makeup is off. Gosh this is such a time saver.</li>
    <li> I like really like this product. It cleans your skins and it smells good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. It&#x27;s my first time to use oil cleanser but it&#x27;s good to my skin.</li>
    <li> It smells great, cleans all my makeup off, and leaves my skin super soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Light cleansing oil that removes makeup easily. Does irritate my eyes a bit. Good for my new double cleansing routine. My face looks better and feels softer since I started using it.</li>
    <li> DHC brand cleans more throughly without an oily after feel. I felt the need to use a foaming cleanser after using this brand.</li>
    <li> This oil made my entire face bright red and irritated. My face felt like it was burning and it left my skin feeling hot. I DO NOT recommend this cleanser for those that have sensitive/combination skin.</li>
    <li> Makeup just melts away with this product! It leaves my skin feeling clean and moist. It has a lovely scent and is a godsend for my dry skin. I don&#x27;t think I can live without this product from now on.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that&#x27;s also prone to breakouts; this cleans off my Kat Von D eyeliner pretty well, and I think it does the trick without drying your face out. You can also add another face wash to this regimen, and if you do, I just recommend using a pump of this first to get off most of the surface makeup. I haven&#x27;t experienced any breakouts or reactions, so this is definitely great for people with sensitive and/or dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re a lightweight makeup user and need a gentle cleanser for nighttime, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very nice, light cleansing oil. Worked well and have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Never used a oil cleanser in my routine but now I can&#x27;t see me without it! Took off all my eye and face makeup in seconds!  It&#x27;s also great to massage the skin and the pleasant smell is a bonus!  My skin has been softer and brighter since using this!</li>
    <li> Great but don&#x27;t get it in your eyes.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. I wear crap drug store waterproof mascara that has the consistency of concrete. This stuff washes off all my makeup and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out. I&#x27;ve got oily/dry skin</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I wasn&#x27;t sure about using an oil as a cleanser but it works well and my skin.  I follow up with a light non-oil cleanser and my skin is cleaner than it has ever been.</li>
    <li> My skin feels soft and ready for moisturizer, very balanced.  I will definitely keep buying this when the time comes.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really see the point to this one before my face cleanser</li>
    <li> I love this face wash! I have combination skin and have had fewer breakouts! It smells great and leaves my skin feeling clean without feeling oily! I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
    <li> This cleanser is so perfect, especially in the dry, winter months. I use it in combination with the Innisfree Jeju Volcanic Pore Cleansing Foam and I&#x27;ll never go back. I love it- it cuts through makeup without drying out my eyelashes. It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> Excellent! Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I like it.!!  My skin pretty dry.. And it works for my face!!</li>
    <li> When I first tried to use this, I expected it to be a more water consistency - NOPE.  No, you gotta rub it in for like a few moments and let the oil dissolve your makeup.  Then you rinse and proceed to wash with your regular face wash.</li>
    <li> Light texture compared to other brands I used before. I usually uses 1 and a half pump on my dry face with the makeup on. This cleans really well, yet keep my skin hydrated after wash off with water. The smell is nice but quite strong so it kinda make me paranoid about the alcohol content that might harm my facial skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a week now but my face has not experienced any allergy to this product at all.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the first time I tried a cleansing oil and I like it. The smell is great (but it&#x27;s because it has perfume in it and that&#x27;s not very good for the skin). But it worked pretty well at removing my makeup. Unfortunately it made my eyes sting like hell, wich means I have to have a softer eye makeup remover, and that&#x27;s not very practical.. I think next time I&#x27;ll try another cleansing oil.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! The texture is light and oily, and it absorbs well when you put it on your skin and personally I think it smells amazing. Also when you wash it off, your skin gets super soft. (There was also a plastic wrap over the product but I took it off before the picture was taken)</li>
    <li> Made my face breakout bad, tried it a few times. Smells really nice thou. Used on my body instead to just use it up..</li>
    <li> This cleanser is inexpensive but don&#x27;t let that put you off it. It&#x27;s very effective. The consistency is thinner than other cleansing oils, but I find this makes it easier to spread on my face. This cleanser removed all my makeup, even my eye makeup. It rinses easily and leaves my skin feeling soft. It&#x27;s become my new favorite cleanser.</li>
    <li> My face is dry and extremely sensitive, my cheeks are constantly a little red, and right after a shower my face is very splotchy. I thought maybe it&#x27;s the soap (Neutrogena Naturals Cleanser) I&#x27;m using that&#x27;s drying out my skin even more. So I tried a go at this on dirty/makeup face with no cleanser and I was paranoid that it wouldn&#x27;t get my face clean enough. But surprisingly it does the job really well, my face was still a little splotchy but my skin felt a lot softer/less dry. It caused no reactions so I looked at the ingredients and one of the top ingredients is jojoba oil.. which explains why it conditions my skin so well.</li>
    <li> I really like this cleanser-smells good, moisturizes, and clean skin!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Removes makeup and doesn&#x27;t leave skin greasy.  Saves me a step at night so I don&#x27;t have to use a separate cleanser and makeup remover.  Have since bought another bottle.  Remember to use on dry skin.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is my first oil cleanser and I&#x27;m liking the results so far. It does have a rather heavy floral scent which I was surprised by, but for those who are sensitive to fragrance, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU. Can&#x27;t stress that enough.&lt;br /&gt;A pump is more than enough to get the job done and though it emulsifies with water, there is still a little bit of residue left on the skin. A follow up with a good foaming cleanser should clear that up.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing! It&#x27;s gets off ALL my makeup and I was really surprised when it got my mascara/eyeliner off the first wash and makes my skin really smooth. It&#x27;s a must have. (I also follow it with a cleansing foam)</li>
    <li> Great for removing makeup dirt and oil. Even better when using the foaming wash after</li>
    <li> I want to like it more.. It removes my extreme waterproof mascara better than the DHC cleansing oil but the scent is so strong and it stings my eyes</li>
    <li> Too oily for me with strong scent.  I use a facial cleanser after it but not impressed.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if it has brightened my skin but it does a good job of removing make up, and it smells great.</li>
    <li> cleans wonderfully and is light and refreshing,It also rinses off very well.</li>
    <li> This is my first cleansing oil. It takes makeup off really well. It smells really good. It feels really good to massage my face with. I like using this to remove makeup over Neutrogena makeup remover wipes. I can&#x27;t help but wonder if there are better cleansing oils that are thinner and less heavy feeling. So I give it 4 stars. It&#x27;s really good, I recommend it for something at this price, but it&#x27;s not enough to keep me from looking for a better one.</li>
    <li> Great for removing makeup and I had a break-out before... this stuff seems to be helping clear things up. Arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read so many rave reviews of this cleansing oil, I expected to love it. I dislike the smell, it stings if it gets near your eyes (kind of defeats the point of using it as an eye makeup remover!), and if it gets near your mouth, tastes horrible. It&#x27;s very perfumey, which I don&#x27;t want in a face cleanser. Seems stickier than normal oils too, making it harder to wash off. Looks like I&#x27;ll be sticking with Jojoba Oil as the first step of my skincare routine!</li>
    <li> I like the scent and the feel, but it does not rinse well. I have to use a wash cloth and often end up using another soap as well. I am not sure if I would buy it again but I don&#x27;t think it is terrible.</li>
    <li> It takes off my makeup pretty well, and it emulsifies easily so it&#x27;s not hard to rinse off. I don&#x27;t like how it stings when you get it near your eyes, though. It&#x27;s also very thin and hard to control. Softymo or Kose oil is better, I&#x27;ve heard.</li>
    <li> After using makeup remover wipes, I use this to get the rest of the makeup that the wipes missed. It works amazing! When I rinse my face with this wash, the water color is murky because it takes all  the foundation off my face. It&#x27;s a watery formula so it does run through my fingers if I&#x27;m not careful enough and it has a strong floral scent, which I could smell all day but some may not like fragrances in their face wash. I highly suggest using a second quick wash with a gentle face soap however so that your skin doesn&#x27;t feel oily. Double-washing is actually a very common practice in South Korea and it has made such a huge difference in my skin cleanliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is nice and light, nicely scented, and cleanses well.  It removes makeup and helps unclog pores.  It does not rinse as clean as DHC cleansing oil, but since I follow a double cleansing routine (Korean 10-step) it&#x27;s a non-issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those new to cleansing oils, you apply this dry. I use 1 pump in clean, dry hands and massage onto my dry face. I mostly only use this in the evening as my makeup remover. Splash with warm water and it emulsifies and rinses fairly clean. Non-drying.  No breakouts since using this. I would likely try another oil when I run out for no other reason than I like to experiment with other brands, but it is a good cleanser for the price so I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This definitely has a pretty heavy perfume (sort of like baby oil) to it, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me and faded quickly. However, if you think you&#x27;d be more sensitive to fragrance it may be best to stick away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s pretty decent. My makeup basically melted off when I used this, though I used it mostly on my cheeks, nose, and forehead and used a regular makeup remover on my eyes and lips. I definitely think I&#x27;d stick with this oil cleanser.</li>
    <li> Its okay. I don&#x27;t think it takes off makeup all that well. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
    <li> I was really excited to use this cleansing oil because there was so much hype about it and I would say this product is worth the hype. I use this cleanser at night to get my makeup off and then follow up with a cream cleanser. The oil is very thin so I usually one need to use one pump, sometimes I have a lot of makeup on I’ll use one and a half pumps. You just rub it into your face and your makeup comes off, I usually rub it on my face for 30 seconds and try to be very thorough. Then you add some water to your face and that makes the cleanser emulsify into a milky color. At this point I rub in the cleaner again with wet hands and work the emulsified liquid around my face. After that I finish off with a cream cleanser. This cleansing oil definitely needs to be with another face cleanser because there is noticeable residual oil after you rinse it off. I’m not sure if that’s to moisturize your face and it’s supposed to be like that but I’m not a fan of it and my skin is very acne prone so I follow up with a second cleanser. This is also great for getting all of your eye makeup off, it gets my eyebrow pencil, eyeliner, eyeshadow, and mascara off very easily and doesn’t make my contacts get cloudy like some cleansing oils (Shu Uemura…). The smell is a light floral scent that isn’t my favorite but it’s not that strong and it doesn’t linger so I’m okay with it. This cleanser lasted my 5 months and I used it once every day so it’s a great value. I didn’t notice a huge amount of brightening with my skin but I mostly purchased this just to remove my makeup so I didn’t really pay attention to that.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like normal cleansers. I have very dry skin and this also melts my makeup off completely. I am very impressed! However, it does come small and I&#x27;m assuming it won&#x27;t last me very long but I still love it.</li>
    <li> Smells *lovely* and makes my skin feel soft. I follow up with a foaming cleanser as this oil doesn&#x27;t seem to remove makeup completely even if I wash with it twice.</li>
    <li> Great product and I love the smell - refreshing and clean. Leaves my skin really soft. I wet my face and rub this slowly in small circles all over so it has a little bit of foam and rinse off. Baby smooth and no breakouts. I tend to get redness on my cheeks after washing but not with this. Super gentle and smells great. Will but again for sure.</li>
    <li> Removes makeup well. You may have to work it into skin a bit to get rid of long wearing concealer/foundation/mascaras. I can&#x27;t speak for other oils, but I felt like this didn&#x27;t emulsify as easily as was suggested by other reviewers. You need to use quite a bit of water and massaging to get everything off, and it is sometimes hard to rinse from the eye area. I typically double cleanse with this, followed by a cream cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, my normal to dry skin definitely feels on the dry side after using this regularly (but only if I wash it off via emulsification. If i wipe it off my face with a warm towel, the remaining oil can moisturize my face). Overall, a solid product, but is not as easy and foolproof as I might want.</li>
    <li> I really like it as far as getting my make up off....however, there is something in it that really aggravates my eyes and makes them either burn or itch.  It takes more rubbing to get the mascara off than I would have expected, but it is waterproof....but this IS oil based and should dissolve even that kind.  I will probably try another kind next time, but may come back depending on results.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I&#x27;ve ever used an ok cleanser and I JUST LOVE IT. It leaves your skin so soft and I don&#x27;t feel my face getting dry at all afterwards. I use this in my first step of my routine</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this. I really did. Before purchasing this I&#x27;d read so many great reviews, but my experience once I received the product was just meh. I used it as instructed and didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin as opposed to my previous routine. I have combination skin, just for reference, and I guess this just wasn&#x27;t a miracle product for me. I would still recommend that others try this out and see how it works for them since their results may be better. The smell, though, I liked about this product since it wasn&#x27;t cloying and the oil I found to not be clogging for my pores :]</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing like it for soft glowing skin. I&#x27;ve been oil cleansing for years and I&#x27;d never go back to regular soap/cleanser.</li>
    <li> Best cleanser, for my dry skin, ever!&lt;br /&gt;I have used MANY different cleansers... gels, lotions, creams, etc. but this is the only one that does EVERYTHING I have ever wanted. This cleanses my skin, takes every bit of make up (even waterproof) off, and moisturizes my skin all in one product. I will use this for the rest of my life. If the other products from the face shop are as good as this cleansing oil I&#x27;d absolutely love to give them a try!</li>
    <li> Pretty good product. It brightened my skin just a little. The oil is really soft and it smells great. It&#x27;s just really liquid-y, so as soon as you dispense it, you&#x27;ve got to quickly pat it on your face so the liquid doesn&#x27;t run through your fingers and you waste it through your hands.</li>
    <li> light and lovely I will repurchase again literally best makeup remover I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> This oil cleanser is great. It&#x27;s got a light scent and a water consistency. When I massage it into my skin I can feel (and see on occasion) the grime coming off my face. The only problem is because its so thin it can drop and get messy. Otherwise great product that I recommend</li>
    <li> But it&#x27;s too drying for me. Which is kinda strange for an oil-based cleanser.</li>
    <li> Didnt really help with makeup removing</li>
    <li> This product does a great job at removing my makeup. I clear off my entire face with a little bit of cleansing oil on a cotton pad, rinse with water, and then cleanse with my regular facial cleanser. This product does a great job at cleaning out my pores and leaving my face with a soft feeling. It takes a bit more effort than regular cleansers to remove it though, so if you are not going to cleanse again, I recommend using a washcloth. I am very satisfied and have just ordered another being that I have run out of my first batch.</li>
    <li> This and the Rice Cleansing Foam will be my go-to facial cleansers from now on. Very gentle but still gets my makeup off. I have sensitive skin and have had wonderful results with this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very light oil and also smells so good.&lt;br /&gt;I had used some other cleansing oil products, but this is the lightest texture I&#x27;ve ever experienced and it works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;I need to use heavy foundation to cover huge brown spots on my face, so I was looking for not only a great cleansing product, but also gentle on my face.  I am glad I found this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I&#x27;m fair skinned with freckles and wasn&#x27;t used to the korean skincare routine.  When I first tried it I felt it was too oily and didn&#x27;t leave me with a typical western clean skin feel.  However, I learned if you use this with water it lathers nicely.  You&#x27;re still left with an oily feeling but I now appreciate this feel.  My skin is much healthy now, no longer dry, and looks more youthful.  I will purchase this again and recommend the product.</li>
    <li> After reading so many positive reviews I really wanted to like this cleansing oil. It feels fabulous, smells really nice, and does a great job quickly taking off my mascara without irritating my sensitive eyes, but I&#x27;ve been breaking out more than usual since I started using this. My face usually gets maybe one spot a month, but at the moment I have four on one cheek alone. Aside from breaking out more since adding this cleanser (it&#x27;s the first step in my double cleanse, otherwise it feels like this leaves a residue), when used with my other products my face gets irritated red blotches all over that fade after an hour or so. There&#x27;s no reaction after using this cleanser alone, and the same goes when I use just my other products. I subjected my poor face to several experiments on the matter. It&#x27;s just when they&#x27;re all used in the same regimen that i get blotchy. For the record, my other products are: a Lush cleanser, Missha Time Revolution The First Treatment Essence, Etude House Wonder Pore Freshner, and an aloe and green tea moisturizer by Alba. Sometimes I use tamanu oil because it&#x27;s a great healing moisturizer. So somewhere in there are ingredients that don&#x27;t play nice with this cleanser when they&#x27;re all on my skin. I&#x27;m going to give this a few more days (maybe my skin will adjust?) before passing it on to someone else.</li>
    <li> I have been using DHC oil cleanser but it&#x27;s a bit expensive so I tried this one. The liquid is watery compared to DHC. It doesn&#x27;t make my face oily and smells so soft, I think it because of rice base. I have tried so many oil cleanser and this one, considering price and quality, I really like it. So far it hasn&#x27;t made my skin break out. One thing I need to mention is that DHC oil cleanser cleans the pores very well but this one doesn&#x27;t. I might go back to DHC after finishing this up.</li>
    <li> Love this oil cleanser. Has a very faint fragrance that is very relaxing. Has helped my skin not be so dry.</li>
    <li> I use this oil based cleanser first, before another pore cleansing wash (egg white pore foam). The combination works great to my slightly acne-prone skin. This has also replaced an eye make up remover - takes it all off! Cleanses very well and moisturizes at the same time.</li>
</ol>
