<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have only used the shadows for far, and the pigment is pretty good from the few colors I have used so far. Is good for the money.</li>
    <li> Daughter seemed pleased.</li>
    <li> The eyeshadows and lip gloss are great.  I use them daily and cannot beat the price for the quality.</li>
    <li> I really like this palette. it is definitely a little like the naked palette. creamy consistency but not that great of pigment. the lip  colors came a little melted probably because of the heat :l.</li>
    <li> Thank you! The package arrived at my house very quickly, was priced well, and was in perfect condition! Exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> The color are very viver. U can use for day or night time.</li>
    <li> This is really exactly like Naked 1 Palette plus a few extra colors. I really like the pigmentation of these colors. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend $50 on a palette. The lip colors are not really that great, but at least there&#x27;s something extra to try.</li>
    <li> I prefer my naked palette over this one. It is worth buying though. I absolutely love the lip glosses, wish you could buy them separately.</li>
    <li> This arrived quickly and looked good, however there was a fingerprint in the lip gloss!  Very distasteful and I will be returning this.  I&#x27;m ordering it from another website which is selling it for less.  Disappointed in Amazon this time.</li>
    <li> Great dupe for both urban decay naked palettes. Great value and color payoff. Lip glosses are nice over lip liner for more color.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a good palette.I got this product for my daugther.She liked it.</li>
    <li> Such a better value than urban decay naked pallet, because you get twice the colors at half the price. The pigments are awsome and highly pigmented and I couldn&#x27;t live without it</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this palette. The mix of matte and shimmer eyeshadows is great, so it can go from a daytime work look to a nighttime date look without missing a beat. They are highly pigmented and shimmery, almost to the point of too much shimmer! I kid, mostly. They stay in place great if you use a primer, and they blend well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the lipglosses. They feel like almost a mix of mostly gloss with a touch of creme lipstick. They are pretty but like most glosses, they don&#x27;t last long at all. Someone said that the glosses make their lips feel weird, and I can see that but all glosses make my lipd feel like that except for my Chanel lipgloss, so I think it&#x27;s an industry thing rather than just NYX.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that this is the only palette that I will ever need, but I can&#x27;t stopping buying other shadows. I will say that I go back to this palette more than any else on my vanity.</li>
    <li> I love this palette :) Colors are amazing, perfect for a natural everyday look. They don&#x27;t crease or fade and last throughout the day. Many of the colors are shimmer and many are matte so that&#x27;s another bonus to this palette. PLUS, i love the lip colors :)</li>
    <li> the eyeshadows are good,but the lipsticks are not good enough.</li>
    <li> very nice palette , you can wear it everyday to go to work . i highly recommend it . they are pigmented and smooth</li>
    <li> This NYX palette is beautiful. Maybe even better. The quality &amp; casing of the palette is like a high-end cosmetic company product. Shadows colors are vibrant, soft &amp; buttery. Lipglosses are shiny &amp; smooth. Very impressed top to bottom. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> EDIT 1/11/2012  A few months ago I bought the Urban Decay Naked palette. I tend to gravitate towards the Naked palette because I started noticing subtle differences in the textures of the two palettes. The Naked palette is a little more blendable, smooth, and the color payoff is very rich. The NYX palette also can be frustrating as a travel palette. There have been many times where the lip colors accidentally slid out and were ruined. It&#x27;s a little clunky. However, the Naked palette isn&#x27;t perfect either. I find it flimsy.  ***********  I&#x27;ve played around with the Urban Decay Naked palette at Sephora and realized that it was too shimmery for me. I bought the NYX Nude on Nude as a cheaper alternative and I&#x27;m so glad I did. The eyeshadows are pigmented, blendable, and beautiful. I actually dented one of the shadows because I expected it to be chalky and plunged my brush right into it. What a mistake! You don&#x27;t have to press really hard to get product. As for the lip colors, I probably won&#x27;t be using them. They are creamy and nice, but not very pigmented. I might buy the UD Naked palette later on as a supplement to this palette.</li>
    <li> Just got it in the mail today. The packaging is nice. However, when I opened it, all the lip colors melted :( Other than that, the eyeshadows are pretty nice. Still sad and disappointed!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this palete. It is a very nice neutral eyeshadow palette. I don&#x27;t really use the lip gloss shades, but I think they are a nice addition (especially for traveling). Smooth and pigmented colors, in well made packaging.</li>
    <li> this is horribly cheap smells and taste like old people and it is the cheapest makeup on earth.</li>
    <li> Perfect colors for a soft look!  They blend well on the eyelid and stay out.  No irritation with any of the colors so far.</li>
    <li> Love these colors!!! Would buy for myself again or for a gift! Colors would look good on many skills tones!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, not very pigmented like I thought it would be even after I used a primer for the eyelids.</li>
    <li> First, let me just give a shout out to Amazon.com customer service!  They sent me this eyeshadow for FREE after Fed-Ex delivered my original purchase to my neighbors house!  I am really glad to shop on amazon.com for this very reason!&lt;br /&gt;This eyeshadow palette is great.  I was trying to find a cheaper way to get my hands on a neutral palette similar to Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked.  I own Naked2, but was not ready to cough up another $50 to get the original palette.  NYX makes a great palette and I am glad I found it.  Not the same quality as Urban Decay but nothing like COVERGIRL or Revlon either-- much better and much prettier.  I haven&#x27;t used the lip gloss and don&#x27;t plan to, but the eyeshadow is such a great addition to my collection I am so glad I bought it.  Thank you Amazon.com for your help getting this to me!</li>
    <li> Ladies! This is a great buy! This is my first NYX product &amp; let me tell you I will forever be a loyal NYX customer! Great pigment, beautiful colors &amp; you get 10 lip colors! You just cannot go wrong with this! Buy one before they run out!!</li>
    <li> I love this palette of eye shadows and lip colors. For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong. The shadows apply evenly and smoothly. I have tried a few Nyx products and each time I was pleasantly surprised.  The shades are neutral and will complement most eye colors and skin tones. If you haven&#x27;t tried them yet, I recommend their eye pencils.  They are excellent quality wood and manufactured in Germany.  I use the light brown for my eyebrows...</li>
    <li> First of all one word: EXCELLENT.&lt;br /&gt;I like makeup but i dont like to look as I&#x27;m going to a special ocassion every day, so i started to look for a natural look eyeshadows but at the same time in the same palette some dramatic colors so i can mix and the look fit with everything. I has like 1 week or 2 to decide which one i will be buy between NYX NUDE ON NUDE or URBAN DECAY NAKED but im so happy i didnt spend 50 dollars in the UD palette because i love this one i have the same colors and more because this one have matte and shimmery colors, they are very pigmented, you can choose between natural look or a more dramatic look and that&#x27;s not all, it also have included 10 really good lipglosses some of them are very pigmented and some of them are more natural.&lt;br /&gt;I have about one year in amazon and this is the first review i do because I HIGH RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> i like NYX, but i didn&#x27;t really have much use of this palette. it does have pigmented shadows but it&#x27;s not as buttery like the lorac pro palette or good quality like the UD Naked palettes. it&#x27;s also a little powdery but i think most NYX shadows are like that.  but if you are on budget and would like to have a neutral palette in your collection, this would be good.  if you like more warm colors, then you might want to consider other palettes. i didn&#x27;t have much use for this because i prefer the warmer toned shadows. although this is good for your day to day makeup since most of the shadows are matte. i didn&#x27;t have any use for the lipsticks because i prefer my lipsticks to have their own container and not mixed with eyeshadows.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this palette. Great quality eyeshadows for the price. Love that it has lip colors that complement shadows. Excellent!</li>
    <li> This one contain variety node tone and smoky color.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly some of them are easily making powder (so quality is diff by color)&lt;br /&gt;And lip color is not that good.&lt;br /&gt;But it is good product compare price and quality.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite palettes! It just so versatile. It has a great variety of colours. You can get very different variations of neutral looks but you can even get some smoky looks also. You also get 10 lip gloss/lipstick shades.</li>
    <li> The nude on nude pallets comes with a lot of colors that are very very close to both of the naked pallets, particularly the first one. It comes with 20 shades, however, weighing 2 grams each (that&#x27;s a lot for an eyeshadow) and lip shades, which though not the best, are quite nice. The eyeshadows are increadible pigmented and give a reeeeeaaally nice color payoff as well.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest difference between this and the urban decay palletes is that the NYx pallete has mostly matte shades, while naked comes with two. I highly recommend this product either in addition to one of the naked palletes, or just to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to pay the $50. You get the same quality, more colors, and a better price.</li>
    <li> This pallette is amazing ,shadows are excellent quality . I do make up and I am very impressed !would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I like this eyeshadow palette, but I think the eyeshadows are smaller than I was expecting and honestly I don&#x27;t even use the lipsticks but it might be good for traveling, I got them in great condition any one was broken or anything like that .</li>
    <li> Love this palette. Very very close to the Naked palette. Can&#x27;t wait to order different ones. This eye shadow stays on great too.</li>
    <li> Just have a hard time deciding how to put the colors together.  Other than that fine.  The lip colors are good too</li>
    <li> I am in the middle of moving so my naked palette is mia so I needed a cheap replacement.&lt;br /&gt;This fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;Lots of colors which is nice and I like that it came with a separate lip palette as well.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the eye shadows are nicely pigmented and others are just meh..even over a  base.&lt;br /&gt;For the price and the extra shadows it is very nice, but I don&#x27;t think it is a proper replacement for the naked palettes.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended if are looking for a cheaper alternative or just need a nice nude palette.&lt;br /&gt;The lip colors are the same half are nice..half I don&#x27;t know why they put those colors in a nude palette. I would suggest putting them over lip balm.</li>
    <li> Love this set, not to bright and applies realy well. Needs a good base though. Second one I,ve owned.  Recommend this one.</li>
    <li> I had hoped for a better quality eyeshadow after viewing numerous rave reviews from you tube.  Although I like the colors, I find the eyeshadow has a lot of fall out which I was trying to avoid.  All in all, it&#x27;s a good palette but not the quality I was hoping for.  I get as much fallout from this as I do from the cheaper shadows.</li>
    <li> Nice one... I think this will work to any complexion of skin because it has a nice light colors and few dark ones just for daily make up...good deal it come on the right time! Would love to purchase again!</li>
    <li> the lipcolours are a little useless seeing as you cant carry it around to refresh. the colours are a nice addition to my small collection</li>
    <li> Loved it! Great set of colors!</li>
    <li> I ordered this palette as a substitute for the naked palettes.  I wanted more matte colors than shimmer because I stick to Wet n&#x27; Wild for very well pigmented shimmers.  The colors are great, they have a nice range and color selection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that the plastic packaging is very flimsy. I think one of the benefits of a compact palette like this is travel and mine arrived slightly cracked from transport. I&#x27;m not bothered by it, just a bit of duct tape and it&#x27;s fine, but it will crack more unless reinforced with regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, it&#x27;s a great palette for the money.  You get great colors, good pigmentation and a nice mix of matte and shimmers.  The packaging isn&#x27;t the best but it can be reinforced, it just won&#x27;t look that pretty.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about this pallete because I already have the Naked2 and Lorac pallete. But it&#x27;s just as great, the colors are highly pigmented and work even better with any eye primer. The lip colors are also great, a lot of people don&#x27;t use the lip colors but I suggest you use them. It&#x27;s worth the money and it would be a great present too. Hope this review helped with your purchase.</li>
    <li> So the mixture of matte and regular type of nude shadows are just perfect and the lip glosses are very nice. The case is very sturdy, it is well beyond your Cover Girl type of case. It is so much more classier and has a better appearance. The nude shades are perfect for myself since I have brown hair/eyes &amp; fair skin. All though my mom likes to borrow this &amp; she has blonde hair/brown eyes with fair skin. The one thing I did notice is that the make-up expires in 18 month of opening per the back of the case. So get ready to use a lot of eye shadow!</li>
    <li> I ordered this a while ago, like most people, instead of spending $50 on a Naked palette. However, now I kind of wish that I had just saved the money and bought UD&#x27;s product anyway. I have a friend that owns the Naked palette and overall, it seems so much nicer than this one. I&#x27;m not a huge stickler on quality (I tend to use drug store makeup much more frequently than high end), as long as whatever I&#x27;m using actually WORKS. This does some, but it&#x27;s not great. My biggest issue with it is the pigmentation of the eye shadows. They look great in the container, but not so much on my eyes. I have very pale skin naturally, but the light eye shadows don&#x27;t show up and the dark ones are too dark for everyday wear. I want it to look natural, but I don&#x27;t want it to look like I literally rolled out of bed and didn&#x27;t put any makeup on. Also, the eye shadows have a lot of fall out and aren&#x27;t very blendable. When I do blend them, they all turn out the same sort of greyish-brown color, no matter what mixture I use. The lips glosses are even worse with pigmentation. But I don&#x27;t mind as much, because I bought the palette for the eye shadows, not the lip gloss. I think I could actually use them as blush though, which would be cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s not a BAD product. For $20, it gets the job done. But after using it for a few months, I think I&#x27;d prefer to have spent more money on the product that I actually wanted. These eye shadows are extremely matte looking, as well. I don&#x27;t need them to be shimmery, but I wish they stood out a little more. Right now, I tend to use my smaller palettes from L&#x27;Oreal or Cover Girl more than this one. Like I said, it&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s not really for me. Some of the colors are better than others. I think I&#x27;ll eventually upgrade to Urban Decay&#x27;s palette and use this more for travel. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d recommend it or not. If you&#x27;re on a tight budget, it might work. However, I&#x27;d consider it before buying. If you&#x27;re looking for a goodlong term product, it might be better to just spend more money on the Naked palette.</li>
    <li> The makeup goes on smooth and last all day but the lip color seem to not show up on darker skin</li>
    <li> The colors are not very pigmented at all and there is alot of fall out. I would not recomend it.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for in color palette. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great color, pigment lasts all day!  I wouldn&#x27;t say that it holds up as well as Urban Decay or another high-end brand, but I haven&#x27;t had too many problems with it.  Plus many of the colors are dupes for the Naked palette.  I don&#x27;t really use the glosses too often, as they are pretty goopy for my tastes, but I&#x27;ve put one on before and the color looked nice, too.  Overall, a good purchase for the price.</li>
    <li> I have eyed this product for a while and finally purchased it. You get a nice mix of matte and shimmer eye shadows. Excellent for everyday and the occasional smokey eye. I just wish the shades were labeled if  wanted an individual shade afterwards. The lip colours are a waste though....no pigmentation at all.</li>
    <li> Though the colors here are similar to that of UD&#x27;s naked palettes, I don&#x27;t think this is a great dupe palette. I bought this a year ago on Amazon and I hardly use the palette. Unlike most NYX products, these eyeshadows are not very pigmented nor do they last more than several hours. Even with a high end primer, I cannot get them to stay. I also had a hard time blending out sharp edges and any uneven spots. The lip glosses are reminiscent the ones found in children&#x27;s makeup palettes. I&#x27;ve tried to use them as balms under my lipsticks but that doesn&#x27;t seem to work because of the thick, waxy consistency. Of all the NYX products I own (around 100), I have to say that this is my least favorite and I regret buying it considering the higher price. If you&#x27;re looking for a Naked Palette dupe try ELF&#x27;s 32 color palette in natural. For around $6, the quality is much better and the colors are truly closer to those of any of the Naked Palettes.</li>
    <li> I liked the variety of colors but that they are still natural colors. They work well for my light skin and dark blond hair. I am not experiencing fall out from the shadow when applying and I haven&#x27;t noticed any creasing. My advice to eliminate fall out is to not put a lot of shadow on your applicator at a time and consider using an eyeshadow brush. To avoid creasing, blend your shadow with a makeup brush. The dark shadows work well with an eyeliner brush as an eyeliner. They don&#x27;t run with normal wear either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like so much is that the case is difficult to open; especially the lip gloss part. Perhaps this will loosen up over time. The lip gloss part was so hard to open on mine that I forgot about it and then noticed there was a second tray.</li>
    <li> These shadows are very nice for the price. Some of the shimmery shadows look different when applied, and there&#x27;s lots of fallout. Other than that, It&#x27;s a really nice palette, very comparable to Urban Decay and some other high-end brands.</li>
    <li> NYX, Dupes for Naked Palette 2 in this one.</li>
    <li> I love the colors, but they aren&#x27;t high quality. You have to use quite a bit to get the pigment to really show.</li>
    <li> Looove! Great versatile palette, variety of mate and shimmer. I can&#x27;t run out of nudes for a while now...</li>
    <li> I really, really like this eyeshadow palette. The shadows are very pigmented and the lipsticks are nice too.  The shadows are not chalky and they blend smoothly.  I think that this is a great palette to own and these shadows are good for all skin tones.</li>
    <li> Eye shadows are great. Stay pretty well put with out a primer. The lip gloss is pretty useless, sticky and wears right off. It&#x27;s still worth it just for the shadows. I did use the nude glosses to layer over a lip stain to give it some shine... so it&#x27;s not completely useless.</li>
    <li> I got my palette today and it is just amazing!! I love the colors. I have the urban decay naked palette and it is nothing like this one. I&#x27;m also in love with the little box it comes in, very cute. The lip colors i have yet to try.</li>
    <li> Was a gift for my girlfriend said that it was one of the best gifts she got she travells with it everywhere and it had all the makeup and lip colours she would need</li>
    <li> Ohhhh this is so nice more pallette eyeshadows than the other name brands sold in high end stores..</li>
    <li> Probably the best thing I&#x27;ve ever ordered in lieu of a pallet. I love it so much the colors are beautiful and opaque. I&#x27;m extremely fair skinned so the lightest ones look natural on me. Lots of really nice cool colors. They&#x27;re very pigmented and show up nicely on the lids. As with most NYX shadows you&#x27;ll probably want an eye primer as they&#x27;re prone to creasing. It&#x27;s a nice affordable dupe for UD&#x27;s Naked pallet. But I think this one is better since I&#x27;m not a a big fan of shimmer. The lip selection is ok I guess they&#x27;re supposed to be sheer for the whole nude effect. It&#x27;s a steal at the price for 20 shadows! I expect to use it up very quickly.</li>
    <li> Just as good as Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked! I&#x27;ve recommended it to all my friends :) The colors are so beautiful</li>
    <li> This palette was nice. A lot of the colors were of the same hue with slight variations. One was shimmery or the other matte.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it. It worked on much more lighter skin tones than for women who were darker. Remember it&#x27;s a nude palette. I would recommend it though. You can layer the darker hues to make it work but it&#x27;s not all that exciting.</li>
    <li> totally love love love this palette! all the colors are great and really gives you a lot of options especially if you like a lot of neutrals which I do. The quality is really good and the lip colors are an amazing bonus!</li>
    <li> I have wanted a neutral palette and couldn&#x27;t decide between the urban decay palettes so I got this because it has a lot of the colors in those palettes for a fraction of the price. The pigment is great, the color lasts all day (I use w/ a primer), and it has a great division of finishes- plenty of mattes which can be hard to find in palettes.  I usually don&#x27;t like lip glosses that come like this, but I&#x27;ve used them and really enjoy them. They&#x27;re not too sticky, good mix of colors, and match well with the shadows. The packaging is nice and sturdy as well. Love this product, can&#x27;t think of anything negative at all.</li>
    <li> I personally love the &amp;#34;nude look&amp;#34; because I don&#x27;t like dramatic makeups. Every shadow and lipstick on this pallete it&#x27;s perfect for accomplish the nude look. I&#x27;ve tried them all and they&#x27;re perfect.</li>
    <li> I only orderd one of the nyx pallete yet i was sent 3 back to back i was made to pay for it and i dont even want it..not o mention the packing was not worth the price of having to spend 3x the amount i was planning very angry i wish i atleast recieved different items.</li>
    <li> I love NYX, but this is really just not a great palette from them. Save the $20 you&#x27;d spend on this and put it towards the Urban Decay Naked palette you&#x27;re trying to dupe (you&#x27;ll only end up getting it later anyway).</li>
    <li> Well, I think you get lots of eye shadow and gloss for the price. I need primer for it to show up well. I think the pigments are very weak. However the lighter nude and tan colors are not too bad. I think it could be a cheaper price overall for the quality.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s anywhere close to the naked pallet. There are more matte shades, and they can come off as chalky. I have to pack more on, and I don&#x27;t think the colors compare to the naked palettes (I own both) Overall I think it&#x27;s ok, If I had to do it over I may not have purchased it. I would rather save my money and buy a higher end product. I didn&#x27;t buy it for the lip products, but I tried them and I do like the lip products. I prefer more nude, sheer looks though so if your going for a dramatic lip this won&#x27;t work for you. I don&#x27;t think this item is worth the hype at all, I&#x27;m kinda disappointed I was expecting a lot more out of it.</li>
    <li> Great eyeshadow palette. Good quality for the price!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s clearly a dupe for Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked Palette, but it&#x27;s a good one. I didn&#x27;t really feel like spending $50 on the Naked Palette, so this was a great alternative.</li>
    <li> Great haven&#x27;t opened it yet but I love it already and it came on time so I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Bought mine at Ulta but wanted to do a review on here.  I know this gets compared to the naked palette and I can see it colorwise.  They swatch great however most the colors look greyish on me once applied.  Not a huge fan of these shadows but it&#x27;s nice to have around.  The glosses are nice enough too.  Good pigmentation.  Overall I find the whole palette okay but not anything outstanding.</li>
    <li> This comes with a lot of very wearable shadows. A couple are chalky, but the rest are great! This is definitely one of the best &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34; palettes out there. Good value for the money! I haven&#x27;t used any of the lip glosses though, so I can&#x27;t speak to those.</li>
    <li> This is the best ever. There are many light colors to experiment with. It is so worth the mint if you are medium to fair</li>
    <li> When I opened the case it was inside of a little box. The outside looked scratched up, but the pallet itself was undamaged. Delivery was 2 days late then it should of been here. Other then those little issues everything was okay.</li>
    <li> great to have all in one case. great variety of colors and also having the mirror and applicator is a plus.</li>
    <li> colors are so pretty and pigmented! I really like this palette; the colors have a mix of matte and shimmery finishes.</li>
    <li> Bought this palette as a back up to my Urban Decay Naked 2 palette. Read so much good reviews about it. Lipsticks are sheer not pigmented and eyeshadows are passable. Cover of palette is too tight.  Not impressed with the quality of this item.</li>
    <li> The colors are not as flattering to my fair complexion and dark hair and eyes as I had hoped, but overall still worth the price I paid as an alternative I could afford to the naked palattes. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I like the variety of colors. I can do allot of diffrent looks with this palette. I don&#x27;t use it even day but when I do, I don&#x27;t know what colors to chose from. Great pallet.</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow palette looked like a winner to me from the reviews claiming it was a great dupe for UD Naked palette.&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that these shadows aren&#x27;t very pigmented. :(&lt;br /&gt;The colors shades are pretty in the palette, but they go on very very light. You will have to reapply over and over again to achieve the kind of look that is even romotely similar to just one application of the Urban Decay Naked palette.&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for. Save your $20 bucks here and just apply it to the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;Now, the lipstick tray was a nice addition. I use them more than the shadows.</li>
    <li> It was just perfect. The packaging wad perfect and looked completely untouched. It came iin a decent amount of time and I was very happy with the product. Great job. Very impressed</li>
    <li> For the most part I really enjoy this palette. The only complaints I have are that some of the eye shadows aren&#x27;t very pigmented and most of the lip gloss colors don&#x27;t really work for me. Other than that, I think I can get a lot of good looks out of this palette, and I would still recommend it as a good neutral palette</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s fine. The lip colors are kinda terrible.</li>
    <li> The lipsticks in this set are dry and once on disappear in about 10 minutes-so disappointing-the eye shadows are pretty colors but faded a bit fast as well-not impressed</li>
    <li> Lipsticks are not that great. The colors are too unclear. But 10/10 for the eye shadows.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this as a gift,I&#x27;m not a big fan about this pallet.I&#x27;m not trying to bash ,I honestly love NYX products but sadly not this one at all.The eyeshadow pigments are weak.The colors don&#x27;t turn out the same and they fade terribly quick.The lip pigments are very poor as well must colors show transparent.This was a gift for my mother and needless to say it&#x27;s just anouther waste of money.</li>
    <li> Returned this item because the colors were pretty chalky and hard to blend. Nyx is usually great product, but this palette definitely didn&#x27;t meet my standards as Urban Decay, Lor action etc do. The customer service was great though! Would purchase from the seller again!</li>
    <li> I really was hoping this would be a good doupe for the naked palette.  It is in no way close to it.  The dark colours dont even show up,  it is really powdery.  I endend up splurging and buying the naked2.. Which is amazzzzzing.  I will NEVER purchase another NYX eyeshadow again.  Poo</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage sister and she loves it!</li>
    <li> This pallete came on time. I love it! The colors are great and and has a good mixture of matte and add himmer colors. My make up stayed on all day. I love this product. I recommend this pallete for anyone who wants a nice pallete but dosnt want to pay an arm an a leg for good make up!</li>
    <li> I like this palette, I have the original naked palette as well and these colors are beautiful too.  I would suggest wearing a eye primer to make the shadow last a little bit longer.  Nice bonus is the lip glosses, not very flattering on my African american skin tone, but mixed with other lipstick colors they&#x27;re great.</li>
    <li> Thanks for an excellent product! Very much I recommend to get! Excellent thing! The price and quality at high level! To use very simply!</li>
    <li> In love with my palette!!</li>
    <li> After doing some research for the best knock off eye shadows I came across this. I get so many compliments when I wear it. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this pallet! The colors are wonderful for a natural look. I&#x27;m fair skinned and these colors look great with my skin. They blend very well and look great together! Love NYX!</li>
    <li> HMMM.. In my opinion, firstly, this is not a great substitute for naked pallet.. Really not. It&#x27;s better for you to saves money and buy the naked pallet later. The eyeshadows doesn&#x27;t really stick to my eye lid and the lipgloss is umm, yeah. But well, I&#x27;m not a make up freak girl.</li>
    <li> This eye shadow set was just what I needed while I was waiting for my Urban Decay 2 set to come in the mail.  It&#x27;s actually a knock off of Urban Decay 2 and is much more cost-friendly.  It comes with a lipstick palette but I didn&#x27;t care for it at all, but it&#x27;s nicely tucked away in the bottom drawer.. out of sight out of mind.  The one comment I will make is that the colors are not heavily pigmented.  But that&#x27;s to be expected at it&#x27;s price point.  I highly recommend for those that want the Urban Decay look without the Urban Decay price.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this palette! I use it almost every day. I love how there is a mixture of matte colors as well as sparkly shimmery colors. I haven&#x27;t really used the lipstick, but I think the eyeshadow is amazing. The colors show up well, and last all day. Would definitely buy again!!!</li>
    <li> Kind of expensive for the amount of make up you receive . But the colors are absolutely gorgeous! I wish the lips sticks were  a larger quality .. but other then  the shorage or lip colors I am completely satisfied with this product</li>
