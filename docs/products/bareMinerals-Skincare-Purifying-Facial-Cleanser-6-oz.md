      <li>Great for sensitive skin.  </li>

      <li>nice fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>but it turned out fine</li>
      <li>For someone with a less turbulent complexion than myself, that trifecta would probably be a perfect fix.</li>
      <li>I love that it lathers, and rinses off quickly.</li>
      <li>It leaves my face smooth and non-drying.  </li>
      <li>Great product and about the same price as walking into a store to buy it...</li>
      <li>I got this in a free sample, and after using it I immediately went out and bought a full-size bottle.</li>
      <li>Leaves your skin feeling smooth, moisturized.  </li>
      <li>Wow, Good Stuff.</li>
      <li>The smell is very fresh and it does not leave any residue on my skin at all.</li>
      <li>I use this with my Clarisonic Mia, you really don&#x27;t even need a whole pump to cover both your face and neck, and it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
      <li>Very gentle, unscented, removes most makeup with just 1-2 pumps and rinses clean.</li>
      <li>so I figured I&#x27;d love the skincare line as well... not so much!</li>
      <li>I was excited to see that I could buy it online instead of going into the mall.</li>
      <li>When I am done, even my eye makeup is removed, and my face feels really clean.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t sting the eyes and rinses clean.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean  but not stripped.</li>
      <li>but I ordered it right from home!</li>
      <li>However, still happy with the Bare Escentuals line as a whole, and may go on to buy their moisturizer as a compliment to this wash.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much for the fast delivery and great packaging.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, really helps even  my skin tone.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It takes into account that the consumer will dilute it with water, releasing the true cleansing power.</li>
      <li>Lathers well, is not drying, and so far seems to be pretty good.  </li>
      <li>I love Bare Escentuals products and this facial cleanser is great.</li>
      <li>It doesnt seems as great as all the other reviews said it did.</li>
      <li>It is a bit pricey but, totally worth it, and 1 pump is all you need to completely clean your face.</li>
      <li>I have been a Cetaphil cleanser fan for years for it&#x27;s gentle cleansing but thought I&#x27;d give this cleanser a try after reading such great reviews.</li>
      <li>If you like mild foaming cleansers with makeup-removing powers, this is it.</li>
      <li>im super sesative to eveything</li>
      <li>Was delivered quickly, and just what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>Bare minerals is amazing.</li>
      <li>It is also very gentle on the skin!</li>
      <li>Was exactly what was advertised and product arrived when it was suppose to!  </li>

      <li>My face feels fresh after each use.</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wasnt so highly impressed with this. I could have gotten it cheaper at my Navy exchange. It doesnt seems as great as all the other reviews said it did.</li>
    <li> This is a good cleanser for me.  I have sensitive skin and have used this one for a number of years.</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser. Only one I&#x27;ve used that takes off all of my eye makeup without hurting or burning my eyes at all. So gentle on my eyes and face. I love it. Sad they don&#x27;t sell it at Ulta anymore :(</li>
    <li> I have been a Cetaphil cleanser fan for years for it&#x27;s gentle cleansing but thought I&#x27;d give this cleanser a try after reading such great reviews. I love it. It is unlike any cleanser I have used before, it completely melts makeup away and yet is so gentle and feels like silk on your skin. It is a bit pricey but, totally worth it, and 1 pump is all you need to completely clean your face. Very satisfied with BareMinerals purifying cleanser.</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the best cleansers I have tried. This is actually my 3rd time purchasing the product! It takes off everything - even mineral makeup and long-wear foundation! It is also very gentle on the skin!</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive and acne/dryness/oilyness has always been a problem, and probably always will be. I love the feeling of this cleanser just after washing my face, and it has helped more than any other product. I especially like it in conjunction with the Bareminerals moisturizer for combination skin, and the foundation by the same company, which actually helped my skin react better to the cleanser, etc. All these products work together to make your face healthier, and that&#x27;s awesome. For someone with a less turbulent complexion than myself, that trifecta would probably be a perfect fix. For me, it&#x27;s the best thing possible.</li>
    <li> I started using this cleanser a couple of weeks ago. I&#x27;ve been a fan of the Bare Minerals foundation/makeup line for awhile, and decided to branch out to their cleansers and facial treatments. Although this face wash did what it was prescribed to do (removed makeup gently), it did dry out my skin more than my regular cleanser. This isn&#x27;t too surprising, since I have naturally dry skin, but I was disappointed since many of the reviews said that it specifically would not dry out your skin. However, still happy with the Bare Escentuals line as a whole, and may go on to buy their moisturizer as a compliment to this wash. Also, as someone else mentioned, while the wash is a bit expensive, there is added value in that you really only need a half a pump to wash your entire face.</li>
    <li> I got this in a free sample, and after using it I immediately went out and bought a full-size bottle. This is the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used: it&#x27;s gentle but effective, and leaves my skin feeling really soft, clean, and healthy. I&#x27;ll never use anything else!</li>
    <li> I got this as a Christmas gift because I had decided I wanted to try something other than just BE makeup products. I use this with my Clarisonic Mia, you really don&#x27;t even need a whole pump to cover both your face and neck, and it&#x27;s amazing! It smells great, is very light and easy on your skin. I also use the moisturizer, which I love even more than the face wash! I wish I had had this line when I was in high and struggling SO badly with such acne prone skin!! I have larger pores and still in my late 20s am acne prone. Well done BE.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time with soaps or any of the different cleansers on my face that i have tried and that is many different ones. For some reason the all make my face break out instead of healing my skin and making it look good. This bareMinerals cleanser though is a different story. Wow, My face is looking better and better everyday. Wow, Good Stuff.</li>
    <li> My face feels fresh after each use. My acne hasn&#x27;t really cleared up though.</li>
    <li> this is a nice, non-greasy cleanser.  It leaves my face smooth and non-drying.  I like the BareMinerals skin care.  You dont seem to need a lot of the product for it to work.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser! It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face and it is so gentle. I have only used it for a short time but will never go back to anything else.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I was skeptical when i first bought it in the bare essentials in the mall, but its the only product that clears up my face. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> company shoes the product in the updated packaging in one picture, then shows the outdated packaging in another picture.  Be ware- the packaging on this product was updated about 2 years ago, so they are selling outdated products and trying to make them look new.</li>
    <li> I love bare escentual products so I figured I&#x27;d love the skincare line as well... not so much! It made me breakout pretty badly... i thought it would get better after a few weeks so I continued to use it but it just got worse. THis is just not for me!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with my Clarisonic. The smell is very fresh and it does not leave any residue on my skin at all.</li>
    <li> I use this cleanser at night to remove my make-up.  It does the trick.  When I am done, even my eye makeup is removed, and my face feels really clean.  (NOTE:  they don&#x27;t recommend using this around your eyes, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it at all, so proceed with caution if you want to try it for yourself.)  This is a great cleanser, and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t use anything else on my super sensitive skin. It leaves my skin feeling clean  but not stripped. It&#x27;s simply the best cleanser EVER!</li>
    <li> This is the only face wash I use. I&#x27;ll keep coming back</li>
    <li> Works great for both men and women. Very gentle, unscented, removes most makeup with just 1-2 pumps and rinses clean. Also, this lasts FOREVER. So although a little pricier up front, it is a fabulous value. I reccomend this to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this for myself, but didnt care for it that much (a bar soup in the shower works just fine for me, lol) so I gave it to my husband to try because I didnt want to waste it. He has had amazing results with it, when other cleansers like pro-active, have failed. He has very sensitive  skin that breaks out easily, but this has been a God-send from oil control to being mosturizing. And it has lasted for months! A great product for those at the end of their wits. You only need 1-2 pumps, and I think he only uses it once a day.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, really helps even  my skin tone.</li>
    <li> Seriously, so good my mom stole it from me. I had to buy a new one on amazon. Leaves skin clean but not too dry and gets my makeup off without scrubbing hard. (including eye makeup) I highly recommend, especially for the price. I should also note that I have VERY sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all.</li>
    <li> It is the only cleanser I have found that does not dry out my skin. It is gentle, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> The BEST face wash ever!!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite cleaners.  It really works.  Even a little goes a long way and is effective.</li>
    <li> Very gentle, but good cleanser.  It is now the only cleanser I use.  I used to switch around a lot to find something I liked, but no more.  Very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Arrived new sealed and perfect. As described face wash item I was a little weary of buying it from someone I didn&#x27;t talk to but it turned out fine and I love this product</li>
    <li> Great product I love it!</li>
    <li> Was delivered quickly, and just what I was looking for.  Great product! It does not strip your skin like other soaps do.</li>
    <li> Bare minerals is amazing. I am 24 and have struggled with moderate acne (even those annoying bumps that won&#x27;t go away) and nothing ever worked until I use this stuff. The cleanser is light and not too sudsy, and it cleans very well. I also use the cell renewal serum along with the moisturizer. This stuff is awesome. I took a break from using it because I thought I could save a bit of $ by switching back to neutrogena naturals. My face broke out immediately. After using this again I am on my way back to normal. I can&#x27;t recommend it enough!!! You have to try it!!!</li>
    <li> Been using it for years on 53 year old skin. I won&#x27;t use anything else, because nothing seems to work as good.</li>
    <li> This product really helps to keep my skin clear!!</li>
    <li> Second time I bought this item.  It is gentle and lasts a long time.  I am very happy it is still available.</li>
    <li> So far, it seems to work well as a cleanser.  It doesn&#x27;t do a thing for blackheads, but most products don&#x27;t, but it still seems to help clean the skin without being a harsh irritating cleanser.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product as always. I was excited to see that I could buy it online instead of going into the mall.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite facial wash!! Cleans but doesn&#x27;t dry my face out. This is good because I have very dry skin. My teenage son even likes it - helps with breakouts. A little goes a long way- 1-2 tiny pumps is plenty.</li>
    <li> nice fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> All you need to one to two pumps and it lathers up and your face is very soft.  Great product!</li>
    <li> If you like mild foaming cleansers with makeup-removing powers, this is it.The difference is that it&#x27;s highly concentrated (like those detergents which you just need a tiny bit to wash your laundry), and ONE pump (a pearl-sized drop), maybe two--will clean your entire face. Similar to Real Purity in that it dissolves all the gunk and goo from your face but rinses clean (ahh, the satisfaction of seeing dirty brown rivulets of makeup in the sink).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes into account that the consumer will dilute it with water, releasing the true cleansing power. Because of the concentrated power, this bottle lasted me almost 1 year.</li>
    <li> I have used the exfoliating powder of this brand for years. Decided to try this cleanser since it was a little cheaper. Works just as well! I have VERY sensitive skin, so the typical cheaper brands cause breakouts or severely dry my skin out. You only need two pumps for your entire face, so it goes a long way. I use the same brand of moisturizer. Both products work excellently!</li>
    <li> Great cleanser not too drying and takes off mascara also.Bare minerals skin care is great for my forty something skin.&lt;br /&gt;This BOTTLE will last a while a little goes a long way. Try the moisturizer as well.</li>
    <li> Love Bare Minerals but found I was breaking out when I didn&#x27;t cleanse thoroughly. Was using Ponds cold cream make-up remover and then cleansing with a complexion brush and Purpose soap. That worked but required taking a lot of &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; with me when I traveled. Tried this Purifying Facial Cleanser and IT WORKED. No more break-outs and a lot less hassle. Although it has a pretty high price tag, one only has to use a little so it should last a long time.</li>
    <li> Best daily cleanser I&#x27;ve found. I am over sixty but still have sensitive oily skin. This is gentle and thorough.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s gentle on the skin but I didn&#x27;t notice any brightening or other benefit that they tout on the container. My skin still feels somewhat dry after using it but it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t dry me up like a lot of other products out there. I would say that it&#x27;s a little pricey for what you are getting (or not getting, as the case may be)</li>
    <li> I always use this product. It was nice to have delivered to my home AND it was less expensive! Win. Win.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product that was milder than what I was using.  I use BE makeup, so decided to try this.  Lathers well, is not drying, and so far seems to be pretty good.  I tend to break out, but not a problem so far.</li>
    <li> I use this product all the tme and I love it.  I have very sensitive skin and this works well for me.</li>
    <li> Been using this for quite some time. It is gentle but removes all make up (even mascara). It doesn&#x27;t sting the eyes and rinses clean.</li>
    <li> GENTLE ON SKIN, DOES NOT SMELL, CLEANS SKIN OF MAKEUP.</li>
    <li> Bare Escentuals bareMinerals Skincare Purifying Facial Cleanser is a fantastic product!&lt;br /&gt;Price is great on Amazon! Wish I would have had this cleanser when I was younger, teenagers&lt;br /&gt;would love it! Thanks so much for the fast delivery and great packaging.</li>
    <li> Great Service!  Was exactly what was advertised and product arrived when it was suppose to!  Will order again from this company!</li>
    <li> nice and makes face feel wonderful</li>
    <li> Love the way my skin feels after using this cleanser! Great product and about the same price as walking into a store to buy it...but I ordered it right from home! Would do business with this seller again!</li>
