### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Practice makes perfect!!!</li>
      <li>So happy to have found these!</li>
      <li>So happy that I found that I can buy it again!</li>
      <li>It worked great!</li>
      <li>It works best this way.</li>
      <li>Great product at a great price.</li>
      <li>I had almost given up looking for this product - but found it on Amazon&#x27;s website and for a great price.</li>
      <li>Thought I could save myself the money and buy this instead of a great straightener like my stylist uses.</li>
      <li>Go for something more money and not a steam straightener!!</li>
      <li>This product gives good results, but has a tendency to leak scalding water from the steam vents.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product and all for anyone to buy it!</li>
      <li>i liked the comb part though, i pulls your hair taught</li>
      <li>and it gets frizzy very easily,</li>
      <li>Because I move around a lot it was great that the hair straightener was easy to pack up and light weight.</li>
      <li>I bought this hair straigtener and it would take me about 30 minutes to get my hair ok looking when the hot tools straightener takes me about 5-7 minutes to make my hair look great.</li>
      <li>so you can prep your hair rather easily while waiting for it to warm up.  </li>
      <li>Afterwords a light mist of some hair spray might be adviseable if you have hair that tends to have a mind of its own, like mine.  </li>
      <li>im still looking for a better straightener...</li>
      <li>Want something better?</li>
      <li>it was comical.  </li>
      <li>Much better.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t always straighten my hair, but when I do I have always found this a rather easy way to do it.  </li>
      <li>But otherwise I strongly support your purchasing this product.</li>
      <li>Love the product - no other straightner works as good as this steam straightner on my hair.</li>
      <li>so I figured it would be fine for me.</li>
      <li>I thought this product was fantastic.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t liked any of them as much as the conair.</li>
      <li>OK, I will admit when I first tried it It didn&#x27;t work well, but reading the directions before one uses an electronic device is advised.</li>
      <li>Now, being that it was a gift I was of course polite and acted excited.</li>
      <li>And I love my new look!!</li>
      <li>I did try it knowing full well</li>
      <li>If not, and you&#x27;re looking for some quick fix, I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend it, but then again straightening hair has never been something quick to be accopmlished, so I doubt you&#x27;ll find anything that will get it done faster.</li>
      <li>It heats up rather quickly</li>
      <li>It was definitely worth it</li>
      <li>I have nice long wavy hair that is full of body.</li>
      <li>Because I had to go over the same spot so many times, I probably inflicted more damage to my tresses than if I had gotten a real straightener.   </li>
      <li>For example, I could have stick straight hair, or straight hair with it flipped inward to give it more body and make it fuller.</li>
      <li>I was right.</li>
      <li>I went home and tried it right away.</li>
      <li>It also helps to use a styling gel of some kind when you first dry your hair.</li>
      <li>didnt smell good and its not very safe.</li>
      <li>This is my first time to replace it.</li>
      <li>They work really well!</li>
      <li>Sometimes it leaks and hot water will burn me.</li>
      <li>It works the best that way heating and straightening the entire section, instead of putting too much hair in and only straightening the outer parts of the big mass of hair.&lt;br /&gt;The added steam feature is definitly a plus.</li>
      <li>my hair is pretty straight</li>
      <li>it doesnt do the job for people who have a certain kinkiness to their hair.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t come with the extra teeth, and I used it without the steam feature, but it still worked fine.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>The water canister doesnt hold much water so you have to refill it all the time.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>My hair is very wavy and frizzy</li>
      <li>It also let me choose the type of straight that I wanted.</li>
      <li>Its a very lengthy process, and it dries out my hair.</li>
      <li>I bought this product to straighten my very curly/thick hair.  </li>
      <li>I have very curly/frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would work very well since I have course hair</li>
      <li>so I need something that will not do that much damage to it.</li>
      <li>Just get it coated lightly on the section before you start straightening it and not only will it help to protect that hair</li>
      <li>I thought that this product would work very well and very consistently, but it was exactly the opposite.</li>
      <li>My hair is only slightly wavy, and this did nothing for me; I would recommend spending a bit more on a ceramic hair straigtener, as they work far better.</li>
      <li>My hair is never frizzy but it never looks particularly shiny.</li>
      <li>suggest spending a little more to get a ceramic iron.  </li>
      <li>True, it doesn&#x27;t open very wide and you can&#x27;t get huge strips of hair in there at a time, but that is the point.  </li>
      <li>It took many different tries to get 1 inch sections of my hair straight.  </li>
      <li>I ended up spending this money and then that money because this product only even 1/2 worked if I spent a good hour straightening my hair which isn&#x27;t even that long.</li>
      <li>The Conair Straight Styles Steam Straightener gave me straight hair and left the body to my hair.</li>
      <li>Skip this product and invest in a better quality and likely more expensive straightener.</li>
      <li>but I was surprised at how it helped my hair!</li>
      <li>and I really enjoy it, however there is one down side.</li>
      <li>My hair does not dry out at all, it is actually better looking than when I just blow dry, and the price is a big plus!</li>
      <li>when i bought this thing, i didnt know this, but my hairdresser told me to stop using it because if you use a hot flat iron like this one when your hair has moisture in it</li>
      <li>Stay away if you have naturally curly hair.</li>
      <li>i would go over the same piece of hair again and again and it still wasnt straight.</li>
      <li>Not as good as the Maxi Glide, sorry, I could not find the Maxi Glide</li>
      <li>I usually don&#x27;t use hair spray for distaste to the way it feels in my hair, and that is not a big problem though as at most</li>
      <li>When I tried the conair straightener, I plugged it in and within a few minutes it was hot and ready to go.</li>
      <li>My hair looked 10 times bigger then it normally is.</li>
      <li>If I sleep with my hair wet and try to use it in the morning, it&#x27;s a little more work.</li>
      <li>Now, I have naturally curly hair-not kinky curly, but not loose waves either.</li>
      <li>Even at the same speed, one side of my head would have stick straight hair and the other flattened waves(not straight).</li>
      <li>ease and clones similiar to it work pretty well in moderate amounts on dry hair.</li>
      <li>First i had to blow dry my hair and then use the iron, and it still left my hair frizzy and big.</li>
      <li>Though of course you should not take this to mean that straightening your hair should be product free.  </li>
      <li>My hair is long and very curly, and to blow dry my hair so that it was perfectly straight would take more than an hour and a half and by the end of the day my hair would be dry, stiff and frizzy.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair, other than make it slightly less poofy, but does no where come near being straight</li>
      <li>My hair is not curly, but it always flips out at the bottom and tends to have a mind of its own at the back (it curls random ways).</li>
      <li>My hair stayed full, and thick, without getting frizzy.</li>
      <li>again), my curly, thick and  frizzy hair,is  as straight as a board and shiny!!</li>

<li> Everytime I use a flat iron</li>
<li> so it doent slip through the flat parts.</li>
<li> i have thick wavy poofy hair, this product did not work at all at straightening but it made it sleeker but would not get it straight unless i spent over an hour on my hair, after i blow dry it.</li>
<li> straigtener did not seem to get very hot and was difficult to use because the jaws did not open that wide.</li>
<li> I jsut get a slight wave in a few spots and it&#x27;s barely an issue in comparison to it going all the way back to curly.&lt;br</li>
<li> Hard to break old practices!</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;i used to have long slightly wavy hair, but after a shorter cut plus bangs, i decided i needed to buy a straightener</li>
<li> I flat iron my hair everyday</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> OK, I will admit when I first tried it It didn&#x27;t work well, but reading the directions before one uses an electronic device is advised.Once I read the directions and tried it again(and again), my curly, thick and  frizzy hair,is  as straight as a board and shiny!! And yes it lasts a couple days.  You have to brush your hair before you use it and you need to do small sections of hair at a time. It also helps to use a styling gel of some kind when you first dry your hair. My hair does not dry out at all, it is actually better looking than when I just blow dry, and the price is a big plus! Practice makes perfect!!! And I love my new look!!</li>
    <li> This product gives good results, but has a tendency to leak scalding water from the steam vents.</li>
    <li> I have long thick wavy hair and this just makes it worse! No matter if it rainy out or not your hair is going to be fizzy. It took forever to heat up and you had to replace the water seemed like every 10 mins. Go for something more money and not a steam straightener!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product recently. I use it daily and I really enjoy it, however there is one down side. My hair is very wavy and frizzy so it takes forever. Its a very lengthy process, and it dries out my hair. But otherwise I strongly support your purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> I found this straightener at a garage sale for 50 cents. I went home and tried it right away. My hair is not curly, but it always flips out at the bottom and tends to have a mind of its own at the back (it curls random ways). My hair is never frizzy but it never looks particularly shiny. I wash my hair once a week so it doesn&#x27;t get greasy and I didn&#x27;t take a shower on the day I tried it. It didn&#x27;t come with the extra teeth, and I used it without the steam feature, but it still worked fine. My hair stayed straight all day and looked shiny-er than usual. Later on that week I used the steam feature and it didnt seem to make a difference from when I used the straightener without it. It was definitely worth it and I plan to continue using it.</li>
    <li> I had almost given up looking for this product - but found it on Amazon&#x27;s website and for a great price. Love the product - no other straightner works as good as this steam straightner on my hair.</li>
    <li> I thought that this product would work very well and very consistently, but it was exactly the opposite. Even at the same speed, one side of my head would have stick straight hair and the other flattened waves(not straight). Do not buy this and buy the Revlon one instead!</li>
    <li> I thought this product was fantastic. My hair is long and very curly, and to blow dry my hair so that it was perfectly straight would take more than an hour and a half and by the end of the day my hair would be dry, stiff and frizzy. When I tried the conair straightener, I plugged it in and within a few minutes it was hot and ready to go. Although it took a while to get all my hair straightened, my hair would remain staright for 2 days! Because I move around a lot it was great that the hair straightener was easy to pack up and light weight. I now bring it everywhere with me. No more blowdryers for me!</li>
    <li> This product just didn&#x27;t work.  First i had to blow dry my hair and then use the iron, and it still left my hair frizzy and big. Want something better? I recommend Revlon&#x27;s hair straightener. It worked great!</li>
    <li> I recieved this as a gift. Now, I have naturally curly hair-not kinky curly, but not loose waves either. Now, being that it was a gift I was of course polite and acted excited. I did try it knowing full well this was not going to work.  I was right. My hair looked 10 times bigger then it normally is. The steam made my hair so puffy and frizzy it was comical.  Stay away if you have naturally curly hair. Steam and curls are not a good combo. My hair looked like I sat in a sauna all day-YIKES!</li>
    <li> if i could give it no stars i would, but that wasnt an option.  this was obviously meant for people with curly hair that is not textured.  it doesnt do the job for people who have a certain kinkiness to their hair.  All it will do it heat it up enough to ruin your hair.  DO NOT BUY IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have nice long wavy hair that is full of body. The Conair Straight Styles Steam Straightener gave me straight hair and left the body to my hair. My hair stayed full, and thick, without getting frizzy. It also let me choose the type of straight that I wanted. For example, I could have stick straight hair, or straight hair with it flipped inward to give it more body and make it fuller.</li>
    <li> This straightener only works well for slightly wavy hair like mine, but when I used it one my friend who has very wavy hair it performed very poorly, ... so in the end I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I usually blow dry my hair with a round brush until it&#x27;s almost dry and then I use the straightening iron on it. I also put a small amount of gel in my hair before blow drying. It works best this way. If I sleep with my hair wet and try to use it in the morning, it&#x27;s a little more work.</li>
    <li> i have thick wavy poofy hair, this product did not work at all at straightening but it made it sleeker but would not get it straight unless i spent over an hour on my hair, after i blow dry it. i would go over the same piece of hair again and again and it still wasnt straight. also the water chamber leaked on my once and burnt me so i stopped filling it up. im still looking for a better straightener...</li>
    <li> Thought I could save myself the money and buy this instead of a great straightener like my stylist uses. I ended up spending this money and then that money because this product only even 1/2 worked if I spent a good hour straightening my hair which isn&#x27;t even that long. Don&#x27;t end up spending your money twice. Skip this product and invest in a better quality and likely more expensive straightener.</li>
    <li> Everytime I use a flat iron I end up frying it and damaging my hair. I flat iron my hair everyday so I need something that will not do that much damage to it. I found this on sale one day at a store and thought I could give it a try. I didn&#x27;t think it would work very well since I have course hair and it gets frizzy very easily, but I was surprised at how it helped my hair! It made my hair shine, added bounce it it, and my hair actually started to grow after switching my flat iron. I LOVE this product and all for anyone to buy it! Though I&#x27;ve heard it won&#x27;t work well with curly/wavy hair, but I have absolutely no complaints!</li>
    <li> I tried this straightener because I thought the steam would reduce the amount of damage I was doing to my hair.  Wrong.  Because I had to go over the same spot so many times, I probably inflicted more damage to my tresses than if I had gotten a real straightener.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The straigtener did not seem to get very hot and was difficult to use because the jaws did not open that wide. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I suggest spending a little more to get a ceramic iron.  Much better.</li>
    <li> Hey guys. I have very curly/frizzy hair. I bought this hair straigtener and it would take me about 30 minutes to get my hair ok looking when the hot tools straightener takes me about 5-7 minutes to make my hair look great. The water canister doesnt hold much water so you have to refill it all the time. Sometimes it leaks and hot water will burn me. I takes about 10 minutes to heat up and doesnt have a switch to turn it off without unplugging it. There is only one heat option. I would not recommend this straighter to anyone.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t always straighten my hair, but when I do I have always found this a rather easy way to do it.  It heats up rather quickly so you can prep your hair rather easily while waiting for it to warm up.  True, it doesn&#x27;t open very wide and you can&#x27;t get huge strips of hair in there at a time, but that is the point.  If you&#x27;ve ever had your hair straightened with an iron at a salon, you&#x27;ll notice that they always use smaller sections of hair at a time.  It works the best that way heating and straightening the entire section, instead of putting too much hair in and only straightening the outer parts of the big mass of hair.&lt;br /&gt;The added steam feature is definitly a plus. It gives your hair an added bit of shine, and at the same time prevents you from totally toasting your hair.  Though of course you should not take this to mean that straightening your hair should be product free.  Frizz ease and clones similiar to it work pretty well in moderate amounts on dry hair. Just get it coated lightly on the section before you start straightening it and not only will it help to protect that hair but it will also help it stay straighter once done.  Afterwords a light mist of some hair spray might be adviseable if you have hair that tends to have a mind of its own, like mine.  I usually don&#x27;t use hair spray for distaste to the way it feels in my hair, and that is not a big problem though as at most I jsut get a slight wave in a few spots and it&#x27;s barely an issue in comparison to it going all the way back to curly.&lt;br /&gt;If you tend to have the time on your hair to straighten it, this is definitly the product for you.  If not, and you&#x27;re looking for some quick fix, I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend it, but then again straightening hair has never been something quick to be accopmlished, so I doubt you&#x27;ll find anything that will get it done faster.</li>
    <li> When I bought the straightener I was instantly unsatisfied with the lack of heat it produced.  It took many different tries to get 1 inch sections of my hair straight.  After just 1 month from the purchase date, only one side of the iron worked.  Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t find my receipt and was stuck with half a straightener.</li>
    <li> So happy to have found these! No longer in stores. Hard to break old practices! They work really well! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Not as good as the Maxi Glide, sorry, I could not find the Maxi Glide so I tried this one</li>
    <li> Worst Conair product I have ever owned.  Can&#x27;t get my hair into the thing and it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough, and the water compartment is too small.</li>
    <li> when i bought this thing, i didnt know this, but my hairdresser told me to stop using it because if you use a hot flat iron like this one when your hair has moisture in it it fries your hair. it didnt even work that well for me. my hair is pretty straight but the front goes wavy and frizzy. i would use it, then 10 minutes later its wavy and frizzy again. also it has no automatic off so i&#x27;ve left if on all day a couple times. the little canister that you put the water in on the end has a felt tipped wick and that part got burnt to the heating element. didnt smell good and its not very safe. i&#x27;ve tried using it without the water canister attached and it doesnt work well because the heated surface is too small in width. i liked the comb part though, i pulls your hair taught so it doent slip through the flat parts.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS IRON. &lt;br /&gt;i used to have long slightly wavy hair, but after a shorter cut plus bangs, i decided i needed to buy a straightener so i bought this one at a local pharmacy for $20. &lt;br /&gt;it did not do anything for me. it couldn&#x27;t even straighten my bangs. all it did was damage my hair. in fact, my hair looked frizzier after i used it.  &lt;br /&gt;i went to my hairdresser and she suggested i buy the chi ceramic straightening iron, which i bought and have been using for 2 years. &lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;re going to invest in a straightening iron, get a ceramic one because they actually work and they don&#x27;t fry your hair. &lt;br /&gt;this product should be taken off the market. conair products tend to be bad in gerneral. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I have used this straightner for 7 years. This is my first time to replace it. I have very short, thick hair, and this is the only straightner I have used that does not burn my head as it has a thick edge surrounding the iron. I can use it with steam or without. Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I had this straightener for 15yrs before it finally quit. I have curly hair and have bought several different straighteners since including the instyler. I haven&#x27;t liked any of them as much as the conair. So happy that I found that I can buy it again!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to straighten my very curly/thick hair.  It did not work at all!  It just made my hair frizzy, even with the use of products.  If you have curly/thick hair I would recommend buying a flat iron instead, they are more expensive (the one I bought was $...)but it actually straightened my hair.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product as a Christmas present, and my hair isn&#x27;t too curly or anything so I figured it would be fine for me. It doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair, other than make it slightly less poofy, but does no where come near being straight (and this is after blow drying it 100%).  My hair is only slightly wavy, and this did nothing for me; I would recommend spending a bit more on a ceramic hair straigtener, as they work far better. My hair stylist said that the steam setting on this iron is not good to use on your hair at all, or you&#x27;ll fry it.</li>
