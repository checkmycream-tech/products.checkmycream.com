### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>For the best shave</li>
      <li>it is a very good stubble razor for the price.  </li>
      <li>I get a very good trim, even all around, I set it at 1.6 while it was 1.8 on the model 900, for my beard and at 2.4 or so for my mustache.</li>
      <li>Seller was great but not blown away with product.</li>
      <li>Still a great shave but a piece of the clipper head snapped and could not hold the spring.</li>
      <li>He says that It works great.</li>
      <li>Worked great for 3 shaves</li>
      <li>I liked the Conair 900 best of those</li>
      <li>have had good experiences with Braun and Norelco.</li>
      <li>good value.  </li>
      <li>But it works good.</li>
      <li>Good luck.</li>
      <li>and I loved that.</li>
      <li>This looked good in the box but just didn&#x27;t cut at all</li>
      <li>I currently own one of these machines but it broke</li>
      <li>but I really liked the design .</li>
      <li>super trimmer - so great</li>
      <li>Overall an excellent trimmer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean with the brush, and the battery keeps a good charge.</li>
      <li>I have tried many many trimmers.  </li>
      <li>Much better than the over-engineered LCD version.</li>
      <li>I will keep looking for something better...</li>
      <li>With the Conair 900 it will increase with .2 increments from .4 to 2ml, then by .5 increments, so this one does give you a bit more choice</li>
      <li>It is a good machine for the price, so if it don&#x27;t work too well I am not out much.</li>
      <li>Hair builds up under the cutter very quickly and blocks trimming.  </li>
      <li>bought it because I like the easy adjustment of the guide.</li>
      <li>Easy to adjust.</li>
      <li>This one worhed fine for 1-2 months (i trim once or twice a week).  </li>
      <li>but I have not yet gotten the hang of feeling truly comfortable with it.</li>
      <li>it will give you a 3 day stubble look at lowest setting and is fairly easy to clean.</li>
      <li>I used to give this 5 stars because its really precise, but after over a year of use, it started making a lot of noise, as if the blades were not oiled even though they were.</li>
      <li>1 stopped trimming, made screeching sound when on.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with my son&#x27;s new trimmer.  </li>
      <li>Loud and not as precise as I would have liked.</li>
      <li>You can easily adjust height and experiment until your beard and mustache are just right.</li>
      <li>Only good point is it is smooth against the skin, but leaves the hair right where it found it.</li>
      <li>Luckily, Amazon allowed me to return it for a full refund.</li>
      <li>I bought a second to be sure to have one when this one wears out!</li>
      <li>had a Phillip Norelco trimmer for years that worked great even when the guide broke a little when I dropped it.</li>
      <li>This is a great little trimmer for not a lot of money.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth trying to get a working unit.</li>
      <li>nice shaver overall.</li>
      <li>Just tossed it in the trash after a week, it doesn&#x27;t cut worth a damn.  </li>
      <li>My old Remington lasted many years.</li>
      <li>This is the most comfortable stubble trimmer on the market, and the plastic comb provides a smooth glide along your face compared to other titanium/hard offerings from the likes of Philips.</li>
      <li>The battery finally died after many many years and had to buy a new one.</li>
      <li>Bought this not from Amazon but from another major outlet which had them on special for $4.99 with free shipping.</li>
      <li>The guide flips back for super easy cleaning.</li>
      <li>When I saw this charger, the 880 I liked the controls due to the fact that it was more like my old Remington, I did not have to set it each time before using it (and if I forgot I would get a very close trim).</li>
      <li>It took ten or more passes get a uniform 1mm stubble.</li>
      <li>First off it didn&#x27;t even cut my beard.</li>
      <li>but I am not looking for stubble, most of the trimmers I tried would not trim close enough, this one will trim very close and increase from .4 to 5 in increments of .2ml.</li>
      <li>I ended up just buying a new one of the same model because I liked it so much, but straight out of the box</li>
      <li>The new one makes the same noise but it seems to cut better.</li>
      <li>The front part of the guide seamed to keep it too high for the lower settings to even work - if it could cut in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>really wish the red light would turn off when it&#x27;s fully charged.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this trimmer because of it&#x27;s adjustable design and slim body.  </li>
      <li>but I used it once and went back to my cheap panasonic.</li>
      <li>I had to chop my whole mustache to stubble because i underestimated the setting length.  </li>
      <li>Cuts very well.</li>
      <li>A very versatile trimmer.  </li>
      <li>so I popped up the guide and used the trimmer straight on th area under my nose</li>
      <li>It trims very close</li>
      <li>They really like it.</li>
      <li>Deducted 1 star because the fine razor for sideburns etc. is not very effective nor does it leave a clean line.</li>
      <li>The only thing I do not like is the floating head, it is not bad</li>
      <li>Went back out and bought a Philips Norelco 3500 with similar thumb adjustment and after one use is so much better for the $39 cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the angle of the blade looked interesting in the box for getting to tight places like under the nose</li>
      <li>highly recommended</li>
      <li>Makes a high pitched screeching noise like a dentist drill.</li>
      <li>so you do have to charge a little more often and for longer periods.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a neat little trimmer that might be OK for people with light facial tasks and have an open wall socket 24 hours</li>
      <li>Had same model for the last 2 years that worked fine.</li>
      <li>Other users have reported this premature death and grinding sound as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Somehow the quality of the new trimmers approximates that of old/used trimmers.</li>
      <li>I ended up buying another new one and the exact same thing</li>
      <li>EDIT: received my replacement, and it has exactly the same problem.</li>
      <li>My first one didn&#x27;t last 3 months.  </li>
      <li>Do keep in mind that each of these will be slightly different regarding height settings so start a bit higher than you think and work your way lower.</li>
      <li>Will bring it home ans sent it back, do not expect much.  </li>
      <li>Is so loud I cant stand it.</li>
      <li>My old remington never gphad an issue.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quiet and doesn&#x27;t vibrate in the hand too much.  </li>
      <li>AND SO FAR IT WORKS FOR ME.</li>
      <li>My last unit went last night,glad I had a Norelco in reserve, while none are as good as my old Remington at least the Remington cuts.</li>
      <li>It would be worth $20 if it were reliable, but considering that many reviewers have had units that died either prematurely or right out of the box, it&#x27;s a bad purchase.</li>
      <li>Which is strange because the more expensive digital one was my favorite for years.</li>
      <li>Decent battery, haven&#x27;t run out and only charged it up a couple times.</li>
      <li>happened- extremely noisy blades right out of the box.</li>
      <li>Returning for a replacement but not holding high hopes given the similar reviews I have just read.</li>
      <li>the new one started making the same loud noise.</li>
      <li>/&gt;(4) Generally underpowered through the run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(5)</li>
      <li>Barely lasts after one charge and sucks to clean.</li>
      <li>The adjustment on this one is purely mechanical, unlike the other Conair iStubble models with digital readouts (those seem over-engineered to me).</li>

<li> After 1 month of daily use this is my go-to trimmer for face and head, works well even on the 4-5mm setting for straight hair, probably no good if you have a fro.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t cut my beard, just kind of pulls the hair out, painful to use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I hardly ever write a bad review but when 4 units go bad the same way it is time say goodbye. My last unit went last night,glad I had a Norelco in reserve, while none are as good as my old Remington at least the Remington cuts. When the Con Air goes bad it starts to make a screeching noise and stops cutting and pulls your beard. I am done, don&#x27;t want a replacement, in the GARBAGE where it belong........I have to edit this review. I bought A2, one for home, one for travel. 1 stopped trimming, made screeching sound when on. Retuned, replacement had ame problem out if the box, got another replacement. This one worhed fine for 1-2 months (i trim once or twice a week).  Away in Brasil, tried to use it today, same sreeching, pulling but no citting.  What a piece of junk.  My old remington never gphad an issue.  One tooth on the cutting adjustmrpent plastc head broke off so i bougth these.  Not sure if the electronin controlled 900 series has the same probkem. Will bring it home ans sent it back, do not expect much.  I have tried many many trimmers.  My old Remington lasted many years. I tried a Norelco, Trym ll and a couple of others. I even tried the Conair iStubble 900, this same trimmer but with electronics controls. I liked the Conair 900 best of those but I really did not love the electronic controls. When I saw this charger, the 880 I liked the controls due to the fact that it was more like my old Remington, I did not have to set it each time before using it (and if I forgot I would get a very close trim). I need a trimmer that will trim closely but I am not looking for stubble, most of the trimmers I tried would not trim close enough, this one will trim very close and increase from .4 to 5 in increments of .2ml. With the Conair 900 it will increase with .2 increments from .4 to 2ml, then by .5 increments, so this one does give you a bit more choice and it is 1/2 the price of the other iStubble. I like it well enough to have ordered a second and put it in the closet. The only thing I do not like is the floating head, it is not bad but I have not yet gotten the hang of feeling truly comfortable with it. I get a very good trim, even all around, I set it at 1.6 while it was 1.8 on the model 900, for my beard and at 2.4 or so for my mustache. A very versatile trimmer.  Do keep in mind that each of these will be slightly different regarding height settings so start a bit higher than you think and work your way lower. I just did this edit as I tried again 1.8mm and ended up needing it to be 1.6mm. Good luck.</li>
    <li> Blades separate and grind. Pulls hair. Get the more expensive model.</li>
    <li> Gave this item as a Christmas gift.  Unfortunately, the receiver of the gift said is was awful.  Instead of cutting the hairs properly it pulled and snagged the hairs causing pain.  He said he had to go over the same spot numerous times to get it to somewhat work.  After buzzing half of the face the experience was too painful to continue. Luckily, Amazon allowed me to return it for a full refund.</li>
    <li> When I first used the i-Stubble, it did a decent job at cutting hair short.  The trimmer was loud and did pull some hair which led to an uncomfortable experience.  When I tried to use the trimmer a second time, the trimmer essentially disintegrated into a pile of pieces never to be used again.  The build quality was horrible and I cannot recommend this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had good experiences with Braun and Norelco.</li>
    <li> I have tried every make and model stubble trimmer and this gives the closest shave with no irritation. I had the version with the lcd screen for almost two years before it started to die. Tried this version and you don&#x27;t need a screen. Still a great shave but a piece of the clipper head snapped and could not hold the spring. Tried two units with the same defect so poor quality control. Never had the issue with the screen version. Going back to the screen version. For the best shave it&#x27;s worth trying to get a working unit.</li>
    <li> super trimmer - so great I bought a second to be sure to have one when this one wears out!</li>
    <li> It did not work and I returned it for credit</li>
    <li> nice shaver overall. it will give you a 3 day stubble look at lowest setting and is fairly easy to clean. It comes with little oil tube to place on blades periodically for maintenance.</li>
    <li> Bought this not from Amazon but from another major outlet which had them on special for $4.99 with free shipping. Completely unusable - pulls hairs out by the root - as painful as it sounds. Not sure where the 4 and 5 star reviews are coming from (perhaps people who purchased this device as gift?). Used once then thrown away. I think I&#x27;d be more angry if I&#x27;d paid over $20.</li>
    <li> although I had to have this replaced under warranty it is a very good stubble razor for the price.  good value.  highly recommended</li>
    <li> Unit is all in one like it says. Built in click adjustable length settings. It trims very short. Even on medium settings. I had to chop my whole mustache to stubble because i underestimated the setting length.  But it works good. The guide flips back for super easy cleaning.</li>
    <li> Barely lasts after one charge and sucks to clean. crap for the cost. wish i had box to return. Bye</li>
    <li> After three months of using it about once a week, the blade stopped cutting and made a grinding sound when it was turned on. Other users have reported this premature death and grinding sound as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For its three months of life it worked well, though it had some downsides. It took ten or more passes get a uniform 1mm stubble. The mustache area was especially hard to trim properly; I had to set the blade to 0.4mm just to make it almost as short as the 1mm beard. The battery life was poor, and it couldn&#x27;t run on socket power, which meant I needed to charge a dead battery for hours before I could use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this product. It would be worth $20 if it were reliable, but considering that many reviewers have had units that died either prematurely or right out of the box, it&#x27;s a bad purchase.</li>
    <li> Faulty blade assembly.  Plastic clip that holds blades will break.  My first one didn&#x27;t last 3 months.  Conair has sent me replacements 3 times with each of them being broken in the box.  Finally gave up.</li>
    <li> Cuts very well. Easy to adjust. You just dial setting. Adjusting is a breeze. No more changing combs. Battery not lithium ion so you do have to charge a little more often and for longer periods. I let it charge overnight every 10 days. No problem. Gave a second unit as a gift. They really like it. No more changing combs on the clipper. You can easily adjust height and experiment until your beard and mustache are just right. Lithium ion battery would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Just tossed it in the trash after a week, it doesn&#x27;t cut worth a damn.  Only good point is it is smooth against the skin, but leaves the hair right where it found it.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my son&#x27;s new trimmer.  He says that It works great.</li>
    <li> Had one for a while but the battery started going but I really liked the design . Couldn&#x27;t find one in the stores anymore.</li>
    <li> Had it for only a couple days before I returned it, rattled like crazy and made a unbearable noise, and it pinched and other my hair, and the precision blade was unusable because you couldn&#x27;t see what you trimming</li>
    <li> I used to give this 5 stars because its really precise, but after over a year of use, it started making a lot of noise, as if the blades were not oiled even though they were. I ended up just buying a new one of the same model because I liked it so much, but straight out of the box the new one started making the same loud noise. I ended up buying another new one and the exact same thing happened- extremely noisy blades right out of the box. Somehow the quality of the new trimmers approximates that of old/used trimmers. I&#x27;m disappointed because it really was my favorite.</li>
    <li> 90% of shaver works good except edger is terrible</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut my beard, just kind of pulls the hair out, painful to use. And my beard isn&#x27;t even very thick. I could only imagine how awful it would be for someone with thick beard hair.</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED THE SHAVER AND SO FAR IT WORKS FOR ME. IT HAS SEVERAL LENGTH SETTING JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR THE 5 OCLOCK SHADOW LOOK. AS I SAID IT WORKS FOR ME.</li>
    <li> I currently own one of these machines but it broke or so I thought. My old one stared to make a weird noise and did not cut very well. The new one makes the same noise but it seems to cut better. It is a good machine for the price, so if it don&#x27;t work too well I am not out much.</li>
    <li> Overall an excellent trimmer. After 1 month of daily use this is my go-to trimmer for face and head, works well even on the 4-5mm setting for straight hair, probably no good if you have a fro. Decent battery, haven&#x27;t run out and only charged it up a couple times. Haven&#x27;t cut myself even when trimming without the guard, around ears, edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BAD:&lt;br /&gt;I really wish the red light would turn off when it&#x27;s fully charged. Apparently it only shows that external power is applied, not whether it&#x27;s charging.</li>
    <li> it is a FACT that I have now had two of these, have kept one, and both very quickly started making an awful grinding noise that only goes away when you use the trimmer with the pivot head pulled all the way back. I wanted to like this....i truly did. It trims very close and I loved that.</li>
    <li> Just awful. Which is strange because the more expensive digital one was my favorite for years. Rips the hair off my neck. Is so loud I cant stand it. Maybe i got a broken one. Not sure , but I used it once and went back to my cheap panasonic. I buy alot of these and this was the worst</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS RAZOR!  Worked great for 3 shaves but like the other reviews said it will eventually malfunction (for no reason) and make a grinding noise and become unusable.  I have returned 3 of these and they all had the same problem.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this trimmer because of it&#x27;s adjustable design and slim body.  It&#x27;s quiet and doesn&#x27;t vibrate in the hand too much.  I wanted it for trimming all my hair, including \\&quot;below the neck.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it failed the task.  Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) Hair builds up under the cutter very quickly and blocks trimming.  Must constantly pop open the guard and brush out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) Short battery life - maybe 20 minutes after 24 hour charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) When battery runs out, the adapter does not supply power to run the unit plugged in. Unacceptable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(4) Generally underpowered through the run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(5) Pivoting head has small range and of limited use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it two stars which equates to \\&quot;I don&#x27;t like it\\&quot; according to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give it one star because I can&#x27;t find myself saying \\&quot;I hate it.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s a neat little trimmer that might be OK for people with light facial tasks and have an open wall socket 24 hours a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely not what I consider an \\&quot;all-in-one\\&quot; trimmer.  I will keep looking for something better...</li>
    <li> Much better than the over-engineered LCD version. This is the most comfortable stubble trimmer on the market, and the plastic comb provides a smooth glide along your face compared to other titanium/hard offerings from the likes of Philips. Deducted 1 star because the fine razor for sideburns etc. is not very effective nor does it leave a clean line.</li>
    <li> EDIT: received my replacement, and it has exactly the same problem. Why would they continue to sell this item when everyone is reporting the same issue? How do i order a unit from a different batch... this one is messed up.  Makes a high pitched screeching noise like a dentist drill. Unusable. Had same model for the last 2 years that worked fine. Returning for a replacement but not holding high hopes given the similar reviews I have just read. What happened Conair? How could you mess up a great product so badly.</li>
    <li> This is a great little trimmer for not a lot of money. It is adjustable from 0.4 to 5 mm, in 0.2 mm increments. The adjustment on this one is purely mechanical, unlike the other Conair iStubble models with digital readouts (those seem over-engineered to me). It&#x27;s easy to clean with the brush, and the battery keeps a good charge. If you are looking for a trimmer to give you that stubble look, this is it.</li>
    <li> Bad for a couple reasons.  First off it didn&#x27;t even cut my beard. I keep a short goatee so not much to deal with and it pulled on the hair as another reviewer stated as well so it wasn&#x27;t just me.  I thought it my be the guide so I popped up the guide and used the trimmer straight on th area under my nose and it pulled the hair and didn&#x27;t cut anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it because I like the easy adjustment of the guide. That seamed to work well but when I looked at it closely it was hard to see where the guide would work for the short settings. The front part of the guide seamed to keep it too high for the lower settings to even work - if it could cut in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the angle of the blade looked interesting in the box for getting to tight places like under the nose but in fact it was difficult to maneuver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a Phillip Norelco trimmer for years that worked great even when the guide broke a little when I dropped it. The battery finally died after many many years and had to buy a new one. This looked good in the box but just didn&#x27;t cut at all tugged on the hairs and didn&#x27;t handle well.  Went back out and bought a Philips Norelco 3500 with similar thumb adjustment and after one use is so much better for the $39 cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stick with what you know works and trust the brands that have worked for you.</li>
    <li> Loud and not as precise as I would have liked. Seller was great but not blown away with product.</li>
