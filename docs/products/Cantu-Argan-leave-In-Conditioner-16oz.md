      <li>Smells good and makes my hair feel super soft</li>
      <li>this was the first leave in conditioner from cantu i used and fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light, but powerful cream that does what it says.  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s very fruity and that is my favorite part.</li>
      <li>It keeps my hair super moisturized</li>
      <li>Using this product along with the Emu Oil has helped my hair tremendously.</li>
      <li>The price is very reasonable!</li>
      <li>My 2nd and 3rd day hair became WAYY better and still had great volume.</li>
      <li>Of the two Cantu leave in conditioners, this is far better than the Cantu shea butter leave in.</li>
      <li>( it has left me sniffing my own hair)</li>
      <li>it took me forever to find the right product for my hair.</li>
      <li>Beard feels great, not sure if it&#x27;s just this.</li>
      <li>I love this product for my 4c fine hair...dry or wet hair this works for me.</li>

      <li>I love how it can be used as an occasional hairdress cream.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair feel so smooth and soft</li>
      <li>I first used it as a leave-in and applied nothing else on my hair after shampooing and washing.</li>
      <li>A nickel sized amount is more than enough for the ends of your hair.</li>
      <li>Use a small amount: as a drop vs a lot is the difference between pleasant and grease ball.</li>
      <li>The argan oil one has a consistency similar to yogurt, very creamy and easy to spread and distribute through my hair.</li>
      <li>When I rinsed it off after a few hours my hair was amazingly silky.</li>
      <li>and it does not moisturize as much as the argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but i don&#x27;t like it as much</li>
      <li>It really is moisturizing and strengthening, and helped with a severe case of dryness and breakage.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my hair surprisingly straight...</li>
      <li>finally found a hair product that helps ,y hair in so many ways,it also help my one year old</li>
      <li>But the reason I rated it 2-stars is it says &amp;#34;ARGAN OIL&amp;#34; and I received the classic Shea Butter.</li>
      <li>Performance: is better than expected, my hair is brand new baby soft, leading to people asking if they can feel it.</li>
      <li>I also tried this product as a leave in after deep conditioning with my neutrogena triple moisture which I mixed with 3 of my favorite natural oils(coconut,grape seed and castor) and it did wonders for my hair!</li>
      <li>in love with product, hair had been very dry from long winter decided to try this after many failures with other products will stick with it</li>
      <li>Smell really good, and leaves my hair soft, but other than that I don&#x27;t see any other change,</li>
      <li>The only con I have is that the first thing I smell is perfume (too strong) and the second is alcohol (which is the second ingredient of the product).</li>
      <li>Result: Very soft and shiny hair.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair feeling very soft and shiny.  </li>
      <li>Leaves hair soft!</li>
      <li>Keeps my hair soft and moisturized !</li>
      <li>The smell is light, and fades away after a little while.  </li>
      <li>this conditioner leaves my locs soft after application.</li>
      <li>I like the argan oil but prefer the shea butter for my natural hair</li>
      <li>made hair soft and  shiney</li>
      <li>it leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Makes our hair soft, shiny and silky.  </li>
      <li>but I was surprised to find the improvement it has made on the volume and bounce of my hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Not really a &amp;#34;leave in&amp;#34; conditioner. Have to wash it out after 15 min.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair feeling very soft and shiny.  I now use after my regular conditioner and I see a difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> Texture is great, like yogurt, but dissolves really well. Been using for 3 weeks and absolutely no residue ( no matter how much I put in) Smell is fantastic, and fades timely so not to stay with you all day. ( it has left me sniffing my own hair) Performance: is better than expected, my hair is brand new baby soft, leading to people asking if they can feel it. It does it&#x27;s intended job well. Ingredients are slightly disappointing, argan oil is not even the first 3 ingredients, and a few unhealthy ingredients at the bottom of the list. This may be the reason why when I apply it on my bangs it caused me to break out on my four head. I have sensitive skin. Use a small amount: as a drop vs a lot is the difference between pleasant and grease ball. Over all I like it, will finish the bottle but will not be buying again and will not be recommending it, the reason being that if I want something healthy liKe argan oil, I want it very healthy.</li>
    <li> So I was skeptical about trying something new in my regimen but I desperately needed to change up my leave in conditioner because Giovanni just wasn&#x27;t doing it for me. I have extremely dry hair. I tried the cantu Argan on a section of my hair while it was dry and it came out stiff but I didn&#x27;t give up. After cowashing my hair I put in some raw natural honey and then applied the cantu Argan oil over that. When I rinsed it off after a few hours my hair was amazingly silky. I have low porosity relaxed hair , I think it helped to have a humectant such as honey on my hair before applying the cantu Argan oil for a deep conditioning treatment. I also tried this product as a leave in after deep conditioning with my neutrogena triple moisture which I mixed with 3 of my favorite natural oils(coconut,grape seed and castor) and it did wonders for my hair! I followed up with a roller set and my hair was incredibly bouncy and soft...no more dry brittle hair for me!</li>
    <li> The smell is very strong and I could not tolerate it and therefore could not see how well it worked.</li>
    <li> I love this product for my 4c fine hair...dry or wet hair this works for me.</li>
    <li> made hair soft and  shiney</li>
    <li> I have used it once...and its kind or runny.</li>
    <li> You definitely don&#x27;t need to put a lot of this in your hair. The product is great for my hair, but I recommend putting some water in there and spraying it all around your head. The only con I have is that the first thing I smell is perfume (too strong) and the second is alcohol (which is the second ingredient of the product). My hair doesn&#x27;t do well with alcohol, leaves it dry and itchy. But it doesn&#x27;t happen to me when I use this product. I do plan on updating my results at the end of this month!!</li>
    <li> I have crazy curly, dry hair and this is the only thing that tames the beast!</li>
    <li> I loved it. it was beyond my expectation.</li>
    <li> Up here in the woods it&#x27;s super dry and my hair and scalp get dry too.  I actually rub this into my scalp after a shower - works like a great hand lotion for you head! And it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair either.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair surprisingly straight...</li>
    <li> My hair loves this!!! 4b/4c&lt;br /&gt;Part of my LOC method.</li>
    <li> Best for over night deep conditioning. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.. Leaves hair soft!</li>
    <li> great smell. do the job. amazing price for 2!</li>
    <li> this was the first leave in conditioner from cantu i used and fell in love with it. From the smell,the feel and the results. It totally repaired my dry brittle dyed hair.*my hair grew so much*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then tried the shea butter leave in conditioner its ok but i don&#x27;t like it as much,it dries kinda white and not a good idea if u are going to use other hair products with it,it smells ok,my hair don&#x27;t grow as fast now and it does not moisturize as much as the argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally found a hair product that helps ,y hair in so many ways,it also help my one year old who&#x27;s hair was thinning and is now full</li>
    <li> if you dont mind having white residue in your hair throughout the day especially when it interacts with other products then this is the leave in for you.But it does keep the hair detangled troughout and its quite affordable.</li>
    <li> Honestly, this is the worst leave in i ever tried. After a few minutes my hair completely dried and looked very unmoisturized. And i tried this product around 4 times.</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff over 2 years now and it smells great and my hair always looks great after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I go through it like crazy though!</li>
    <li> I love this cream. I feel it is completely different from the shea butter cream which does nothing for me. This is so moisturizing and smells great. I will buy more.</li>
    <li> in love with product, hair had been very dry from long winter decided to try this after many failures with other products will stick with it</li>
    <li> Very good leave in makes hair soft</li>
    <li> Of the two Cantu leave in conditioners, this is far better than the Cantu shea butter leave in. While the shea butter dries to a white flaky finish and left my hair feeling a little dry, the argan oil leave in is easily absorbed into the hair and leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable. Note: you do not need a lot of this product for it to work. A nickel sized amount is more than enough for the ends of your hair.</li>
    <li> This product is very good! Keeps my hair soft and moisturized ! Very happy will try the shampoo and conditioner too!!! ❤️</li>
    <li> Great product but it&#x27;s way cheaper at walmart</li>
    <li> Came back on time. Makes my hair feel weird to me but smells good and adds some moisture.</li>
    <li> I have 2b/2c, mid-length hair and I follow the curly girl method. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week as a leave-in conditioner only (followed by a dime-size amount of SM Curl Enhancing Smoothie).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I first used it as a leave-in and applied nothing else on my hair after shampooing and washing. Result: Hair smelled good and soft but did not control my frizz as much.&lt;br /&gt;- I then started applying a dime-sized amount of SM&#x27;s Curl Enhancing Smoothie after I used a quarter-sized amount of this leave-in. Result: Very soft and shiny hair. My 2nd and 3rd day hair became WAYY better and still had great volume. I used to prefer my 1st day hair and have to wash my hair on the 3rd day as my hair would become limp but after adding this product to my hair routine, I can go more than 3 days with volume and bounce still retained!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially purchased this so I could use less of the SM Curl Enhancing Smoothie (it&#x27;s about 3x more expensive and also heavier) but I was surprised to find the improvement it has made on the volume and bounce of my hair. No residue or grease that I&#x27;ve noticed yet. And my hair smells great for days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;m prone to headaches and on days that I have one, the smell can be irritating.</li>
    <li> Love this leave in.  It does not weigh my hair down.  it leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I tried this leave-in cream because my hair loves Argan oil, and it&#x27;s formulated for relaxed hair as well.  It really is moisturizing and strengthening, and helped with a severe case of dryness and breakage.  The smell is light, and fades away after a little while.  It&#x27;s a light, but powerful cream that does what it says.  For relaxed hair, I use it for styling and for relieving dryness, focusing on the ends, because it does have water in it.  I love how it can be used as an occasional hairdress cream.</li>
    <li> nice in my crazy curly hair</li>
    <li> Smell really good, and leaves my hair soft, but other than that I don&#x27;t see any other change,</li>
    <li> Honestly, I can&#x27;t tell if this conditioner helps or not....haven&#x27;t noticed any improvements. However, I am satisfied with the kid&#x27;s line so I will stick with that.</li>
    <li> I like the argan oil but prefer the shea butter for my natural hair</li>
    <li> Argan Oil has made my hair silky without taking away any of the body.  I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have to be rinsed out and it leaves my locks irresistible to touch!</li>
    <li> I use this as a daily moisturizer and it has my hair soft, so I bought a another one when I run out of this one, and I wanna try the shea butter one</li>
    <li> it took me forever to find the right product for my hair. Absolutely love it ! Makes my hair feel so smooth and soft</li>
    <li> this conditioner leaves my locs soft after application.</li>
    <li> I use this twice a week and my hair is healthier,  shinier and easier to manage. You get so much for so little.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it was going to be like  the Shea butter leave in conditioner, I was wrong.  Its horrible.  Its sticky and feels horrible on my natural hair.  Does not work for me.  Ill stick with the Shea butter. than k you very much.</li>
    <li> I LOVE CANTU. But the reason I rated it 2-stars is it says &amp;#34;ARGAN OIL&amp;#34; and I received the classic Shea Butter. I already had a Shea Butter at home which is why I wanted to purchase this one to try it out. I am very disappointed and sad, to say the least. But I really love Cantu Shea Butter Leave-In so it&#x27;s okay. I was just hoping for a little variety in my leave-in.</li>
    <li> Smells good and makes my hair feel super soft</li>
    <li> Excellent hair Repair, leave in and deep conditioner. Using this product along with the Emu Oil has helped my hair tremendously. I LUV the smell of this Cantu. I apply it as a leave in overnight deep conditioner with a plastic cap a few times per week. I also apply as a daily or 3-4 times per week leave in conditioner. It has thickened my thinning hair. I apply it on a regular basis and it has helped my split ends and has repaired my hair breakage from the split ends. EXCELLENT results and I am thrilled about this Cantu product. I just ordered another jar.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I use it as a carrier to help smooth the natural products and oils for my homemade hair conditioner.  It adds thickness to the product and shine and softness to my hair.  The price is very reasonable!</li>
    <li> keeps yor hair healthy</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Smells great.</li>
    <li> My cousin recommended this for my hair. I have mostly 4A hair which is very coily and difficult to detangle. I used this when I&#x27;m doing the L.O.C. Method. It made my hair soooooooo soft and easy to detangle. I&#x27;ve never used the Shea butter leave in but I have seen it and it&#x27;s thicker than the argan oil one. The argan oil one has a consistency similar to yogurt, very creamy and easy to spread and distribute through my hair. And the smell, omg. It smells so good. It&#x27;s very fruity and that is my favorite part. The scent stays with you for a while so be weary of that. You don&#x27;t need a lot, a dime size is enough. I would totally recommend this product to those with thick, natural hair.</li>
    <li> Smells nice ,It&#x27;s fine but it feels like its watered down(to me at least; first time using this) not as thick as Cantu Shea butter leave in.</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery. I love Cantu Shea Butter and the Argan Oil version is also great. Smells great and it very effective. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I just put some in my hair and kept it in my hair overnight and it came out absolutely amazing! It smells great to and I&#x27;ve recommended it to all my family!</li>
    <li> Really good stuff, and smells good too.  Makes our hair soft, shiny and silky.  Probably need to use it daily.</li>
    <li> Love  this product&lt;br /&gt;.. it doesn&#x27;t  weigh down  my curly  hair</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It keeps my hair super moisturized</li>
    <li> I use this as part of my routine to condition my beard. Beard feels great, not sure if it&#x27;s just this.</li>
    <li> Made my hair break off and left a white paste when it dried.</li>
    <li> I use Cantu Shea Butter leave-in conditioner.  This product is a lighter creme conditioner. I love the smell. I would recommend this to my friend.</li>
