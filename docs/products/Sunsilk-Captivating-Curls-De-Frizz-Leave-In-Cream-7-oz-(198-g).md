      <li>Many products claim to De-Frizz and calm hair but do not deliver when applied to hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d found several products that would make it look great, but leave it crunchy.</li>

      <li>I remember buying up a bunch of this on clearance for maybe $2 a bottle, and never would have believed that I would pay this much for it, but it really does a good job of keeping hair soft and less prone to frizz.</li>

      <li>I joke that I have an \\&quot;arsenal\\&quot; of hair product, simply because none of them have ever worked right</li>
      <li>I use a small amount of the Sunsilk Captivating Curls leave-in creme along with the Captivating Curls shampoo and conditioner to keep down the frizz in my naturally curly hair.</li>
      <li>I live in 40-80% humidity, which will make my hair poof and frizz without product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair and Suave</li>
      <li>and the chlorine has stripped my natural oils.</li>
      <li>It replenishes the hair and leaves it soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>I used it when it sold in local stores and the price was much cheaper</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had waist-length naturally curly hair since I was fourteen years old (in 1963), and have tried just about every hair product out there.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve scoured the Internet for this product, the only one that&#x27;s worked for my hair--somewhere bt wavy and curly, and increasingly frizzy as I get older.  </li>
      <li>what we don&#x27;t under stand is why the price is so high last year</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t find it after that and no other product matches the look it gave.  </li>
      <li>I have tried more expensive products that do not work nearly as well.  </li>
      <li>It tamed my hair yet left it soft, not hard or sticky like a lot of other hair creams do.</li>
      <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s worth the price.  </li>
      <li>I have natural loose curls</li>
      <li>Always have loved this product just too bad they don&#x27;t make it anymore.  </li>

<li> I tried Sunsilk, and my hair almost went flat.  </li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve searched for most of the past decade, minus 4 years in the military with short hair, for a product that could tame the frizz and control the curls.</li>
<li> They make my hair very soft and tame the frizz in my curl.</li>
<li> I like to use this when my hair feels rough and frizzy.</li>

<li> Regardless of what else I use, I always spray my wet hair with Infusium 23 Leave In Treatment ... and typically follow it with a curl-enhancing gel/mousse/whatever.  </li>
<li> I mean I definitely see a difference when I use it versus when I don&#x27;t,</li>
<li> we paid half of what we paid this year.</li>
<li> An amount no more than the size of a quarter is enough for shoulder-length thick hair.</li>
<li> No more frizzies for my hair....</li>
<li> I have a bag full of products I&#x27;ve bought to replace Sunsilk, used once and hated.</li>
<li> I usually have to use one other product to control the frizz in my hair and even then, it&#x27;s not perfect.</li>
<li> However, the price for this stuff is simply ridiculous!</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s not a perfect product.</li>
<li> but it got very, very expensive.  </li>
<li> She has the worst tangled hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, it works for people with natural curly hair.  I used it when it sold in local stores and the price was much cheaper but I love it and will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to hair curl enhancer. With this my curls last for an extra day. It&#x27;s better than any thing else I&#x27;ve tried. Love-Love-Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I love ithis cream..my hIr is curly again and again...is not sticky or heavi or glui...i love it in my hair</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this product, however most of the normal stores have stopped carrying it.  I started using it over 3 years ago, and after buying more expensive products, I found that my hair prefers this. Doesnt leave a heavygrease in your hair, and great if you have to flat iron or blow dry</li>
    <li> I loved this stuff! It tamed my hair yet left it soft, not hard or sticky like a lot of other hair creams do. It made my curls look great! It was also inexpensive too! The only thing that has come close is Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine Anti-Humidity Smoothing Milk but I miss my Sunsilk!</li>
    <li> But my shopping cart won&#x27;t accept more than one.  I&#x27;ve scoured the Internet for this product, the only one that&#x27;s worked for my hair--somewhere bt wavy and curly, and increasingly frizzy as I get older.  And then they go and discontinue it.  I have a bag full of products I&#x27;ve bought to replace Sunsilk, used once and hated. This one is best at eliminating that coarse frizz and not leaving a lot of residue on the hair or my brush. I just found a pkg of 12 on eBay and will go with it, tho pricey.</li>
    <li> Best product ever made! Sunsilk is silk in a bottle &amp; great light weight hold for awesome soft curls</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for my hair......was exactly what I was looking for. No more frizzies for my hair.... get you some!</li>
    <li> I will never understand how item get taken off the market.  I love the De-frizz conditioner.  It has so far been the best product to help me comb my granddaughters hair.  She has the worst tangled hair.  I have tried more expensive products that do not work nearly as well.  I will most likely be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> Always have loved this product just too bad they don&#x27;t make it anymore.  What used to cost about $3.50 is more like $25</li>
    <li> I was looking for an alternative for Suave curly hair cream which was awesome and I purchased it from walmart for $2 only. I have naturally curly hair and Suave was the best product I have ever used. Couldn&#x27;t find it after that and no other product matches the look it gave.  This Sunsilk should not be more than $5 but as its not in shop these people are charging alot for it, it give an antifriz look and give my hiar cute curly look but when i wake up the next morning it makes my hair too dry and again the same frizzy not like the Suave cream. All in all a good product but a better and cheaper alternative is [[ASIN:B003DRZJ2G Suave Professionals Sleek Anti-Frizz Cream - 5.1 Oz (3 Pack)]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy with curly hair, and I like it medium length (4-6 inches). My hair is curly enough to occasionally form 1/4\\&quot; diameter \\&quot;coils\\&quot; that will bounce all day and make girls punch me in the arm in jealousy (Hey, I can&#x27;t figure out how to do it on purpose, either). I live in 40-80% humidity, which will make my hair poof and frizz without product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve searched for most of the past decade, minus 4 years in the military with short hair, for a product that could tame the frizz and control the curls. I&#x27;d found several products that would make it look great, but leave it crunchy. Romantic interests like to play with my hair, and I like to facilitate that, so the crunchiness that most products leave is a bit of a deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d tried mousse (Wow I&#x27;d never tried to spell that before), light gels, japanese \\&quot;moving rubber\\&quot;, the works. I joke that I have an \\&quot;arsenal\\&quot; of hair product, simply because none of them have ever worked right so I continued the search. I&#x27;ve easily 10 or 12 products that I&#x27;ve tried. This year. Mousse and gels leaves it heavy and crunchy, and if I break up the crunchiness, the frizz comes back. Moving rubber leaves a sliminess all day that even I won&#x27;t touch (though you can do some cool stuff with it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the winner. It handles the frizz with ease and doesn&#x27;t leave a sliminess. It does not boost the curls to the extent that a good mousse will, however. When I want more curl, I combine this with the best mousse I&#x27;d found ([[ASIN:B004C0SWA4 L&#x27;Oreal Paris Studio Line Upward Spiral Springing Curls Mousse, 6.9 Ounce]]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I have an uncommon hair type, I&#x27;ll try to post a picture because if your hair is like mine, you need this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a while ago before it was discontinued. I have natural loose curls and I use this all the time. It does exactly what it says it does. I like to use this when my hair feels rough and frizzy. I especially love to use it after I&#x27;ve been in the pool and the chlorine has stripped my natural oils. It replenishes the hair and leaves it soft and manageable. It also has a wonderful scent that lingers throughout your hair for that just washed feel. Overall I was exceedingly pleased with this product and I hope you future buyers enjoy this product like I have.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why they almost stopped making this. When word got out, it became super popular. Now it is more expensive than it used to be but is still the same great product.</li>
    <li> I use a small amount of the Sunsilk Captivating Curls leave-in creme along with the Captivating Curls shampoo and conditioner to keep down the frizz in my naturally curly hair. It allows me to air-dry my hair with just the addition of a tiny dollop of L.A. Looks Curl gel without having it frizz up in Florida&#x27;s humidity. I&#x27;ve tried other de-frizz products, but none of them work as well. I do recommend you use this leave-in creme with the Captivating Curls shampoo and conditioner for maximum frizz-taming effect. An amount no more than the size of a quarter is enough for shoulder-length thick hair.</li>
    <li> I got this product because I used to love it when it was selling in stores. But this one is not like the original. It makes sense the original was discontinued 5 years ago. Save you money.</li>
    <li> I have curly short, thick-ish 3b/4a hair. The product made my hair feel sticky, crunchy and just plain gross. Maybe it&#x27;ll work for someone who has wavy hair, not curly.</li>
    <li> Pretty good stuff but it got very, very expensive.  Not sure if it&#x27;s worth the price.  Used to be 1/3 the current price...</li>
    <li> This creme is my go-to hair product.  I feel that it helps to control my hair and not leave a greasy residue.  I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> My hair is light and frizzy. After I put it on, my hair is soft and it&#x27;s good for curls. I like this product.</li>
    <li> Many products claim to De-Frizz and calm hair but do not deliver when applied to hair.  This product really works, and lives up to its marketing information.  However, can&#x27;t find it in stores, but I&#x27;ll gladly order online for such a beneficial product.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it helps my curly more controllable and easy to brush ,I  thank amazon for  selling this product. what we don&#x27;t under stand is why the price is so high last year we paid half of what we paid this year.</li>
    <li> I love this product. However, the price for this stuff is simply ridiculous! It use to be $4. 00 a bottle, but since it is now a discontinued item, the price has sky rocketed. It is a shame. Now I can only buy this stuff 1- 2 a year as a pose to monthly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had waist-length naturally curly hair since I was fourteen years old (in 1963), and have tried just about every hair product out there.  Regardless of what else I use, I always spray my wet hair with Infusium 23 Leave In Treatment ... and typically follow it with a curl-enhancing gel/mousse/whatever.  I tried Sunsilk, and my hair almost went flat.  I had to re-wet it, add more Infusium, and then use a large blob of Biotherapy Silk to get it to curl.  I wish I&#x27;d had the experience others did with the product, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  Obviously I&#x27;m throwing out this bottle and won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister as she has curly hair. She asked me to buy some more for her as it was success. Will buy more if need be.</li>
    <li> I remember buying up a bunch of this on clearance for maybe $2 a bottle, and never would have believed that I would pay this much for it, but it really does a good job of keeping hair soft and less prone to frizz.</li>
    <li> All of the sun silk products are great! They make my hair very soft and tame the frizz in my curl. I wish these products were easier to find and have recommended them to many friends</li>
    <li> BUT it&#x27;s getting pricey! Wish they&#x27;d bring the original recipe back to meet the demand. Here are five more words.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this Item!! It works really well on my hair, PLEASE restock this item i really need some, i use it everyday and i have really really curly hair and i love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> I love this cream because it does work as a great conditioner, keeps my hair soft and controls the frizz to an extent. I mean I definitely see a difference when I use it versus when I don&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s not a perfect product. I usually have to use one other product to control the frizz in my hair and even then, it&#x27;s not perfect.</li>
