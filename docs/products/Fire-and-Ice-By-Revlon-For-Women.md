    <li> Ordered product on March 29.  Was notified by e-mail that the item was on backorder, but would be sent as soon as their shipment arrived.  On April 18, the money for this order was taken out of my account.  As of today, May 14, I am still waiting for my purchase.  I notified Samsonline and was informed that they too, could not track my order that was supposedly sent.  They are trying to make my order good, but I am still waiting.</li>
