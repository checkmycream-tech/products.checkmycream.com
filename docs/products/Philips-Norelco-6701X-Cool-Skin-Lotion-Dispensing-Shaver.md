### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This line of Norelco is the best you can buy for the money.  </li>
      <li>This works great in the shower.</li>
      <li>Ive used the Norelco 6701X for about a month now and it works great.</li>
      <li>I have to admit that using a shaver with the built in lotion is great.  </li>
      <li>Great razor</li>
      <li>Great price for self moisturizing electric razor.</li>
      <li>and it does a GREAT JOB</li>
      <li>Great close shave, love the norelco shaving gel/lotion, it&#x27;s quieter than my Braun 1775, and the 3 pivoting heads are perfect for where your neck/chin curves.</li>
      <li>Battery lasts forever and the charger is good anywhere in the world with a multi voltage automatic selection.  </li>
      <li>and i think it was a good purchase..</li>
      <li>I have owned this razor for sme years now and have always gotten a good close shave.  </li>
      <li>you can&#x27;t leave it in the charger more than 8 hours or it will shorten the battery life!  </li>
      <li>Make sure you rinse the blades    </li>
      <li>It takes more than one shave to determine the quality of an electric razor.</li>
      <li>and I believe this is definitely a better shave.</li>
      <li>One would think that if they design it to be used in the shower that they would make the casing more grippable as well as durable.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a very good shaver, but i expected a closer shave...</li>
      <li>with the cons, it&#x27;s a great razor, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>The unit feels cheap and uses NiCad batteries -- this is the biggest problem I have with it.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t personally say this is a great product</li>
      <li>Philips Norelco 6701X Cool Skin Lotion Dispensing Shaver&lt;br /&gt;Philips</li>
      <li>Last one was good for eight years, my fault it died then.</li>
      <li>Like most electrics you will only be able to go about 2 days without shaving max when using this model, any longer and the razor will just pull whiskers and not shave close at all.</li>
      <li>but on the bright side, it&#x27;s really great for people with sensitive skin because there&#x27;s hardly any irritation, also the battery lasts for over two weeks (and i have to say i use it every day and sometimes twice a day...).</li>
      <li>Close, comfortable and very convienent to shave in the shower.</li>
      <li>but I am beginning to wonder if the convenience of shaving in the shower is worth the cost.</li>
      <li>The first lasted 8 1/2 years.</li>
      <li>I decided that I would follow the instructions to the letter for the first couple of weeks.</li>
      <li>Instead, begin shaving at the edge of the \\&quot;beardline\\&quot; and use slow, deliberate circles and you will achieve a nice, smooth, comfy shave.     </li>
      <li>I love this shaver, it&#x27;s an all a rounder, the only problem, it does not shave very close other than that it&#x27;s OK......</li>
      <li>I recommend for anyone that wants a long lasting razor that gives a good shave - in or out of the shower.</li>
      <li>Absolutely will buy another one if or when this one dies.  </li>
      <li>His head and face look as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom, and he especially loves the shower</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s really anoying to have to pump the gel...</li>
      <li>This unit is at the bottom of their Coolskin line and uses their older shaving head technology, by the way</li>
      <li>This is a classic shaver.....</li>
      <li>(all slots vs their new technology which uses a combination of slots + holes).  </li>
      <li>and I am fortunate that I really only have to shave a couple of times a week for work and such.    </li>
      <li>and I my facial hair is not thick.</li>
      <li>On other products that use NiCads the charging unit itself will first dishcarge the battery thus eliminating the memory effect, but not this charger.  </li>
      <li>If you must shave daily (like most of us) and don&#x27;t like the dry, irritating feeling after shaving then this one is for you.</li>
      <li>It takes longer than using a conventional razor, but when you&#x27;re finished, your face is smooth from the moisturizer and you have no more whiskers.</li>

    <li> Works well for what they are intended.</li>
    <li> This works great in the shower. I have dropped it a few times without it breaking. I just snap the parts back in place and start shaving again. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. I shave in the morning and before the night is over I have whiskers again...and I my facial hair is not thick.</li>
    <li> This is my second lotion dispensing shaver. The first lasted 8 1/2 years. If you must shave daily (like most of us) and don&#x27;t like the dry, irritating feeling after shaving then this one is for you. I like the Nivea lotion, the Nivea shave gel doesn&#x27;t work as well on my skin. This model holds a charge long enough for 12 days of shaving. Does not have a low battery indicator like my last model though so you have to monitor the performance and recharge when needed. Water resistant so you can just rinse after each use. Like most electrics you will only be able to go about 2 days without shaving max when using this model, any longer and the razor will just pull whiskers and not shave close at all.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that using a shaver with the built in lotion is great.  Far less mess and I don&#x27;t have to carry around extra bottles of other lotions.  Battery lasts forever and the charger is good anywhere in the world with a multi voltage automatic selection.  Absolutely will buy another one if or when this one dies.  Last one was good for eight years, my fault it died then.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a week now.  I have a very heavy beard that goes in all directions.  This unit is at the bottom of their Coolskin line and uses their older shaving head technology, by the way (all slots vs their new technology which uses a combination of slots + holes).  I use it with shaving foam, not their expensive Nivea packets.  I get a reasonably close shave, though it&#x27;s difficult to shave under my nose and under my chin, thos areas never get as close as I want.  The unit feels cheap and uses NiCad batteries -- this is the biggest problem I have with it.  NiCads suffer from memory effect unless you frequently let it run down all the way (and as you can&#x27;t run this unit while corded that presents a problem!  They actually recommend that you let it lose almost all its power before recharging, I guess you&#x27;re supposed to turn it on and go away).  On other products that use NiCads the charging unit itself will first dishcarge the battery thus eliminating the memory effect, but not this charger.  Also, the charger will not prevent overcharging -- you can&#x27;t leave it in the charger more than 8 hours or it will shorten the battery life!  In my view these are fatal flaws.  I&#x27;m sending it back.  By the way, it does NOT include a trimmer.    Note: I&#x27;ve since discovered the Remington MS3-3700 and recommend that shaver.  See my review of it</li>
    <li> This model lasted one year for me before I dropped it for about the fourth time and now it is no longer water proof. Now it only works if I charge it after every use and then only as long as it remains dry inside. One would think that if they design it to be used in the shower that they would make the casing more grippable as well as durable.  The other con is that this model doesn&#x27;t come with the trimmer attachment. You have to spend at least another $40 for a higher end model for that convenience. Frankly I am debating whether to buy another one. This model replaced my Norelco Advantage wet/dry model which lasted about four years before the switch stopped working. Somedays it wouldn&#x27;t start and somedays it wouldn&#x27;t shut off. So in five years I have spent over $200 on Norelco wet/dry razors but I am beginning to wonder if the convenience of shaving in the shower is worth the cost. I have no complaints about the quality of shave but it appears that Norelco has done little to the design of these razors over the past five years to improve the quality of the construction.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a very good shaver, but i expected a closer shave... it&#x27;s really hard to shave under the jaw and it&#x27;s really anoying to have to pump the gel... but on the bright side, it&#x27;s really great for people with sensitive skin because there&#x27;s hardly any irritation, also the battery lasts for over two weeks (and i have to say i use it every day and sometimes twice a day...). all in all i do recommend it and i think it was a good purchase..</li>
    <li> This line of Norelco is the best you can buy for the money.  If you follow the directions about getting used to using it, you&#x27;ll never go back to a blade.</li>
    <li> I purchased 4 of these razors 6 years ago.  They are still operating.  I bought this additional razor to give to my grandson.  Hope he can use it for as long as the other four of us have used ours.  I recommend for anyone that wants a long lasting razor that gives a good shave - in or out of the shower.</li>
    <li> I hate shaving. I loathe it. It may be the worst part of being an adult male (which is, you know, not such a bad thing but still...) and I am fortunate that I really only have to shave a couple of times a week for work and such.    After reading the reviews here about a year ago, I went for it and bought the CoolSkin.    I decided that I would follow the instructions to the letter for the first couple of weeks. I shaved every day (horrible!!!) and then after about 10 days, something &#x27;clicked&#x27; and it became an actual pleasure to shave.     It takes longer than using a conventional razor, but when you&#x27;re finished, your face is smooth from the moisturizer and you have no more whiskers. Yay!    If you \\&quot;let yourself go\\&quot; for a bit and have longer whiskers, don&#x27;t worry, it will still work. Don&#x27;t hold the razor at the ends of the whiskers or it will simply PULL THE BEARD OUT OF YOUR FACE and no one except for a small yet vocal type of person wants that sort of pain in their life. Instead, begin shaving at the edge of the \\&quot;beardline\\&quot; and use slow, deliberate circles and you will achieve a nice, smooth, comfy shave.     Make sure you rinse the blades    Do it.  You know you want it. Do it...</li>
    <li> I love this shaver, it&#x27;s an all a rounder, the only problem, it does not shave very close other than that it&#x27;s OK......</li>
    <li> I purchase this Norelco 6701X a very long time ago, I wrote down purchased in 2007, but it could have been earlier than that either late 2005 or mid 2006...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it just about every day and feels just like the day I purchased it.  In fact, I had not bought new blades [too expensive] and had the same ones the last 2yrs and they also feel like I just got them yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only not shave my beard, but also my head and it does a GREAT JOB</li>
    <li> Great price for self moisturizing electric razor. Purchased for my father in law for Christmas. He Loves It! I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have owned this razor for sme years now and have always gotten a good close shave.  I can carry it every where I go and the charge will last for well over 2 weeks before every needing a recharge.  Great razor and well worht the money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my soon-to-be son-in-law, who shaves his head. He wanted a razor he could use in the shower. I can&#x27;t personally say this is a great product but he says so, so I&#x27;ll take his word for it. His head and face look as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom, and he especially loves the shower feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christy</li>
    <li> This is a classic shaver.....Norelco should go back to making them again.Philips Norelco 6701X Cool Skin Lotion Dispensing Shaver&lt;br /&gt;Philips Norelco</li>
    <li> It takes more than one shave to determine the quality of an electric razor. The manual tell you to give it three weeks for your skin to adapt to an electric razor. Ive used the Norelco 6701X for about a month now and it works great. Close, comfortable and very convienent to shave in the shower. No more cutting my face with the Mach III razor.</li>
    <li> My only other experience with electric razors has been with the Braun 1775 and I believe this is definitely a better shave. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;PROS: Great close shave, love the norelco shaving gel/lotion, it&#x27;s quieter than my Braun 1775, and the 3 pivoting heads are perfect for where your neck/chin curves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;CONS: Shaving in the shower doesnt give you as close of a shave, it supposedly takes 8 hours to charge and charge only lasts 40min, and you can&#x27;t shave while it&#x27;s plugged into the wall. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Even with the cons, it&#x27;s a great razor, especially for the price. Buy it!</li>
    <li> i bougth this shaver in Turkey (made in Holland)  8-years ago for 120$&lt;br /&gt;its litlle expancive for this shaver ?!</li>
