      <li>I love it,It is much better then a brush.</li>
      <li>I gave one eCh to my friends as I love these .</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
      <li>My husband never helps me with my back so this is there greatest!</li>
      <li>I would suggest that the makers of this product take care of this issue as it is, again, a pretty good product otherwise.</li>
      <li>Made with very good materials that look like they will hold up to daily use.</li>
      <li>The handles are easy to hold and the item soaps well.  </li>
      <li>it was very handy and does a good job cleaning and feels very nice on your back and any other part of your body</li>
      <li>Mine wasn&#x27;t but it seems fine now.</li>
      <li>Both feel great on my back though..</li>
      <li>A bit shorter than my original one from some years ago, but works fine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The PDF e-Guide they send with the email was very useful and informative in helping me know what types of body wash to use depending on the results I am looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>I used body wash and put some on the rougher and smoother side and both sides soaked it all in and provided a great clean deep in my pours...</li>
      <li>measures a full 28 inches and with the additional 2 inches on each end provided by the handles, I can easily reach all portions of my back and body when in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;The softer side is great for massaging my shoulders and neck areas when taking a hot shower and the exfoliating side really does a wonderful job of stimulating my skin and removing dead cells.&lt;br</li>
      <li>perfect, i have a pretty big back and not i can take care of myself without having to find a creative way to hit a corner.</li>
      <li>but love it thanks</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; works great and feels even better, especially under a steaming hot shower in middle of winter.  </li>
      <li>Not being handy with thread nor needle, I took it to our local cobbler (yes, cobbler) shop and Marcie</li>
      <li>and it dries easy, highly recomended.</li>
      <li>Had a good one from another company for a long time, but as it was wearing out, decided to get a new one.  </li>
      <li>More recent one had remedied this with braided handles.  </li>
      <li>Works OK, but not abrasive enough for me.</li>
      <li>Far too cheap and flimsy a product for the price point and for the intended use.</li>
      <li>I ordered a back scrubber from Amazon in the past and it was perfect for me.  </li>
      <li>Overall it&#x27;s OK.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for something a bit more abrasive for use on my back</li>
      <li>On first use the stitching started coming undone.  </li>
      <li>First one, the handle came off after used twice.  </li>
      <li>The thing began to literally come apart at the seams (where handles are sewn in) during first use.  </li>
      <li>A chief gripe is one of the straps pulled out the first time I used it.  </li>
      <li>pleased to have accepted Jager Online&#x27;s offer to receive this Exfoliating Back</li>
      <li>there fixed it by attaching the handle and tucking fabric as it should have been and sewed things securely.    </li>
      <li>It is smooth on one side and a kind of rough smooth on the other...</li>
      <li>The back scrubber doesn&#x27;t really serve as a  scrub because it doesn&#x27;t have a loofah or similar &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; like fabric to do any good.</li>
      <li>I expected the scrubbing part to be a bit more abrasive.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>Who dosent like a clean back haha</li>
      <li>Other than that, I think he likes it ok.</li>
      <li>But the nature of this brush is that the handles will be stretched and pulled as the thing is being used -- and must be securely attached.  </li>
      <li>I will pry&#x27; end up reinforcing seams with heavy duty thread, after which I will most likely enjoy this product.</li>
      <li>Large enough and great for scrubbing my back and feet without any trouble.  </li>
      <li>It is way too delicate to be effective for anyone needing a true back scrub.  </li>
      <li>I think I could use it better if it, or its handles were a little longer.  </li>
      <li>It is soft and too gentle for my older musquline body to be called &amp;#34;exfoliating scrub&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>just didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.</li>
      <li>Did not last after the first use.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The edges are bound with soft material so that it won&#x27;t fray from usage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I like something that I can really feel scrubbing my back.</li>
      <li>Just the thing to reach my whole back!</li>
      <li>little body wash goes a long way and the pocket on the exfoliating side will easily hold a bar of soap as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Jager</li>
      <li>I was slow to do it; but I did FINALLY get those handle seams reinforced with some strong thread, and I have to say that</li>
      <li>Used a brush in the past but can&#x27;t get the added pressure to deep clean and massage.</li>
      <li>Not a quality back scrubber, but a decent long, skinny washrag if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re in the market for.</li>
      <li>Very useful tool as I am getting less and less flexible.</li>
      <li>This is a high quality extremely well made Back Scrubber/Massager strap!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I gave one eCh to my friends as I love these . My husband never helps me with my back so this is there greatest!</li>
    <li> Sufficient length for me but I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;9&amp;#34;, and I wish it were longer. Biggest issue is the scrub pad, it&#x27;s not very &#x27;scrubby&#x27;. I was hoping for something a bit more abrasive for use on my back and this is not abrasive at all. I don&#x27;t feel any scrubbing or massaging. Overall it&#x27;s OK. Can&#x27;t say I recommend it. EDIT: Fell apart after about 6 uses. Total garbage.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not quite rough enough for me but it&#x27;s okay.  I like something that I can really feel scrubbing my back.</li>
    <li> Who dosent like a clean back haha Do wish it was a bit scratch&#x27;er haha but love it thanks</li>
    <li> Far too cheap and flimsy a product for the price point and for the intended use.</li>
    <li> Thin but adequate if you are tall or have broad shoulders it will be a trick getting it behind you but hey it works. quality is similar to the dollar store</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting , but it&#x27;s ok I guess.</li>
    <li> Worthless, used it twice and it started coming apart. The scrubbing part is so thin you can&#x27;t feel it. Total waste of money..</li>
    <li> Great product and quick ship.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Just as advertised.</li>
    <li> Works great. I like that it can be washed like a towel.</li>
    <li> Works great. Good quality. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Very useful tool as I am getting less and less flexible. Used a brush in the past but can&#x27;t get the added pressure to deep clean and massage. Haven&#x27;t had any problems yet.</li>
    <li> Way too short for me and I am only 5 11</li>
    <li> Best there is and best price!!</li>
    <li> Just the thing to reach my whole back!</li>
    <li> Quality back scrubber.  Delivered and works as described.</li>
    <li> I think I could use it better if it, or its handles were a little longer.  Otherwise, just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> On first use the stitching started coming undone.  Good thing mom taught me how to sew.</li>
    <li> Large enough and great for scrubbing my back and feet without any trouble.  Made with very good materials that look like they will hold up to daily use. The handles are easy to hold and the item soaps well.  A keeper!</li>
    <li> Very weak scratcher.  Did not last after the first use.  Would NOT buy again.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Doesn&#x27;t do anything else besides the back. Hard to use.</li>
    <li> perfect, i have a pretty big back and not i can take care of myself without having to find a creative way to hit a corner.</li>
    <li> REACH THE BEST PLACES</li>
    <li> This is a high quality extremely well made Back Scrubber/Massager strap!&lt;br /&gt;The stitching is tight and Jager Online has placed a double row of stitching where the handles attach to assure that they will not come loose.&lt;br /&gt;The edges are bound with soft material so that it won&#x27;t fray from usage.&lt;br /&gt;I especially like the length of this strap.&lt;br /&gt;Mine measures a full 28 inches and with the additional 2 inches on each end provided by the handles, I can easily reach all portions of my back and body when in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;The softer side is great for massaging my shoulders and neck areas when taking a hot shower and the exfoliating side really does a wonderful job of stimulating my skin and removing dead cells.&lt;br /&gt;A little body wash goes a long way and the pocket on the exfoliating side will easily hold a bar of soap as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Jager Online shipped my order promptly and offered excellent order follow up.&lt;br /&gt;The PDF e-Guide they send with the email was very useful and informative in helping me know what types of body wash to use depending on the results I am looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased to have accepted Jager Online&#x27;s offer to receive this Exfoliating Back Scrubber/ Massaging Strap in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and will be purchasing in the future to gift to my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works OK, but not abrasive enough for me.</li>
    <li> I love it,It is much better then a brush.</li>
    <li> Its okay what it&#x27;s meant to do but it feels fragile and I&#x27;m just cautious when using it but overall okay</li>
    <li> i had hoped this would be a little rougher.  I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s doung much exfoliating.  i aslso wish it were a bit wider.  just didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; works great and feels even better, especially under a steaming hot shower in middle of winter.  The exfoliating pad could be a bit longer but it does the job.  A chief gripe is one of the straps pulled out the first time I used it.  It didn&#x27;t tear; simply pulled out of its seam.    Not being handy with thread nor needle, I took it to our local cobbler (yes, cobbler) shop and Marcie there fixed it by attaching the handle and tucking fabric as it should have been and sewed things securely.    Not sure if I got one that was simply poorly made or if the design is flawed. But the nature of this brush is that the handles will be stretched and pulled as the thing is being used -- and must be securely attached.  Mine wasn&#x27;t but it seems fine now.</li>
    <li> Good quality.  Works great in the shower.  Seems like to will hold up through time.  Only wish it was a little longer.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a gift and recipient loves its flexbility and ease of use.  She is arthitic and normal back brushed were too hard for her to handle.  These are har to find in brick and morter stores</li>
    <li> I ignored reviews saying the handle would rip off, but I shouldn&#x27;t have. The handles on this, rather than being a sold loop sewn under an overlapping piece of scrubber, are lengths of rope sewn on by the tips. Of course they&#x27;re going to break. Mine lasted six showers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My big beef with this product is that it is not scratchy. It appears that they used something like chenille woven onto some cotton backing with synthetic, dental floss like thread. Not a quality back scrubber, but a decent long, skinny washrag if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re in the market for. Or maybe a sling for a long, spidery arm. Or a dachshund buffer.</li>
    <li> One of the straps broke shortly after my husband started using this. Other than that, I think he likes it ok.</li>
    <li> Works just as described...nice!</li>
    <li> One of the handles broke on the second use.  It is useless without the handle</li>
    <li> Very disappointed I got the back scrubber but i only received the the 2 scraps no brushes or bonus package</li>
    <li> Too flimsy--&amp;#34;rough surface&amp;#34; is not at all&lt;br /&gt;Rough!!! Not recommended!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I expected a back scrubber not this surface!!</li>
    <li> Nice i just wish it had a rougher side for exfoliation. OTHERWISE NICE.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, built strong. Great scrubbing material and it dries easy, highly recomended.</li>
    <li> This product is not at all what I expected. I need something that will exfoliate. Wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it.</li>
    <li> This product is useless for exfoliating; a regular wash cloth is more coarse.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing and actually overpriced for what you get.</li>
    <li> The back scrubber doesn&#x27;t really serve as a  scrub because it doesn&#x27;t have a loofah or similar &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; like fabric to do any good. It is way too delicate to be effective for anyone needing a true back scrub.  I used it one time and after that placed it on a &amp;#34;Return&amp;#34; shelf.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I suffer with limited shoulder mobility, therefore this back scrubber was to short for me and the width seemed to be very narrow .  I ordered a back scrubber from Amazon in the past and it was perfect for me.  It was extra long (36&amp;#34; L x 4.5 W).  I hope they get back in stock!</li>
    <li> Would have liked to have more of the loofah.</li>
    <li> Makes me feel sssoooooooo good!</li>
    <li> It works good, but wish it was a bit longer. It seems like it was made for a petite person</li>
    <li> In one month, fell apart,</li>
    <li> It is smooth on one side and a kind of rough smooth on the other... Both feel great on my back though.. I used body wash and put some on the rougher and smoother side and both sides soaked it all in and provided a great clean deep in my pours... Great product, thanks!</li>
    <li> It works alright, but not as abrasive as i had hoped, does the job though</li>
    <li> The thing began to literally come apart at the seams (where handles are sewn in) during first use.  I will pry&#x27; end up reinforcing seams with heavy duty thread, after which I will most likely enjoy this product. But I won&#x27;t be using it until then  Needless to say, I do not recommend this item unless you do like to sew (I do not like to sew).....Update: I was slow to do it; but I did FINALLY get those handle seams reinforced with some strong thread, and I have to say that this massager/scrubber works great - it&#x27;s a good purchase. I would suggest that the makers of this product take care of this issue as it is, again, a pretty good product otherwise.</li>
    <li> I expected the scrubbing part to be a bit more abrasive. It feels like I am washing with a sponge.</li>
    <li> Had a good one from another company for a long time, but as it was wearing out, decided to get a new one.  First one, the handle came off after used twice.  More recent one had remedied this with braided handles.  A bit shorter than my original one from some years ago, but works fine.</li>
    <li> This is not a scrubber in my view. It is soft and too gentle for my older musquline body to be called &amp;#34;exfoliating scrub&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> it was very handy and does a good job cleaning and feels very nice on your back and any other part of your body</li>
