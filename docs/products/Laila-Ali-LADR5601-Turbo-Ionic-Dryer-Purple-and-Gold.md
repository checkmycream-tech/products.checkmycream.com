      <li>Also the gold part makes it easy to touch when hot.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for 3 months and it caught fire I dont dry my hair often but I definitely wasn&#x27;t expecting to have a small electrical fire in my home for a temporary blow out :-(</li>
    <li> Absolutely fantastic hair dryer.  I would highly recommend it to any family member or friends.  The settings are true, and dry my hair at the right setting without being too hot or too cool.</li>
    <li> Im so happy i purchased it.it leaves my hair soft and shiny.i love all of the heat settings.great blow dryer.you should get you one.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what I need it to do. Great for blow drying thick natural hair. I love it!</li>
    <li> Item kept sparking ..on the higher setting...an I was to afraid to use after that...thought an electrical fire would start..</li>
    <li> Very thick, Natural haired girl! Purchased because it was the only dryer that came with the comb.  comb comes off while drying, duct tape handles that!  However the teeth of the pick are not sturdy, used dryer twice a week about 6 mos and no teeth left on comb.</li>
    <li> Great dryer! The attachable comb cuts drying time in half.</li>
    <li> I want to give this dryer negative stars, but unfortunately that isn&#x27;t an option.  The comb design is horrible and completely broke after the second time I used it.  First it kept popping off, and then the dumb thing just completely broke even though I was using it gently and on fully combed through hair.  I like to switch between the high and low settings, but the lever that you use to switch settings is really flat and difficult to slide up and down.  Also, like some of the other reviewers, my dryer sparked...like it had some internal lightning bolt action going on within.  I loathe this dryer and will never purchase another Laila Ali product again.</li>
    <li> I saw a spark several times in the switch area when changing from High to off setting. I&#x27;m going to return it. I liked it because it is lightweight and it worked well drying my hair. :-(. But I&#x27;m afraid a spark will fly soon and my hair will catch fire. Yikes!</li>
    <li> This is the best blow dryer hands down. The heat that it generates makes quick work of my hair drying task! The comb attachment is great and the volumizer works well also. It handles well and doesn&#x27;t get too heavy when I am drying the top of my hair. I like the comb attachment because I don&#x27;t have to use my brush. The purple and gold is so not boring.</li>
    <li> Great item and very fast shipper...bought one before had to get a second for someone else</li>
    <li> Still in good working condition but when I switch it off there is a flash of light that comes from the on and off switch which is frightening. Not sure why this happens</li>
    <li> This product is great.It was delivered on time,the comb is strong it doesn&#x27;t break easily.I love that it doesn&#x27;t blow too much and too little cold and heat.i will recommend this product to a lot of people.Also, it has a nice grip to this product!</li>
    <li> Has such a nice finish and really helps in the pre straightening process. My new favorite !</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE!!! If your hands aren&#x27;t bone dry, you will never be able to turn this hair dryer on or off. The comb attachment falls off the second it touches your hair. Soooo frustrating! Sent it back immediately! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Love it! Cuts the time doing my girls hair in half!</li>
    <li> I would give this product 5 stars ; but the attachment comb is loose and it turns.....Other than that the power is strong and it works well...</li>
    <li> Great product however I had mines for 3 months used is twice and today (7/20/15) was the second time I used it and when I tried to turn it off the power switch sparked. Very dangerous.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok,it dries your hair only thing the comb keeps twisting,and it flickers my lights.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it the nozzle is always coming off it dries your hair well but the nozzle keeps coming off</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer mainly because I always try to support black owned products when I can. It is a nice dryer, and so far non of the picks have broken. I do wish it did a better job of actually straightening my hair; but then again it&#x27;s not a $150+ dryer.</li>
    <li> Gave it as a gift. She loved it!!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t have much heat power.</li>
    <li> I tried this dryer twice and both dryers had the same design flaw, the comb attachment.  I have really curly hair but its kind of thin so this shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.  i&#x27;ve had a few dryers in my life and never had this problem. it kept snapping off while i was drying my hair. one time it snapped and the momentum caused me to knock myself square in the eye! needless to say after that i packed it up and printed my return label.  if i can&#x27;t dry my hair with the comb its useless to me.  the heat is great and i really do think if they could fix the way the comb attaches to the dryer they would have a great product.  it should screw on instead of just snapping on the mouth of the dryer.  if you don&#x27;t need the comb to straighten your hair then this is a good product but unfortunately for me it&#x27;s a necessity.</li>
    <li> Great buy wife is loving it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African American with natural hair. I love the straight look, but not all the chemicals to get my hair straight. This is one of the best hair dryers I&#x27;ve ever owned. I can&#x27;t give it five stars because the comb pops off very easily and it has a turn off switch that turns off mid use sometimes my finger accidentally turns it off. However I&#x27;ve never had a dryer to blow cool air and that&#x27;s a great feature as well. With naturals we don&#x27;t like to use a lot of heat on our hair so that&#x27;s a plus!</li>
    <li> This piece of mess here is a rip off if you received a defensive one like I have. I emailed these people and still have not received a response. The dryer is stuck on high the first day I used this product this happen so now it want turn off</li>
    <li> my daughter is thrilled</li>
    <li> The slide button for on/off is difficult to maneuver and annoying.  They seem to not mention what the wattage for this dryer is, why is that?  I have owned and used this blow dryer for about a year so it does last.  The comb attachment is not durable for extremely curly hair.</li>
    <li> Dries My hair fast.  It Has three settings, low, medium, high and a cool button. It works for me a</li>
    <li> happy. does exactly what a blow dryer is supposed to do. doesn&#x27;t burn your hand if you hold the barrel part, which is a plus. the comb teeth are sturdy too.</li>
    <li> The comb does. It sit in one position it just keeps spinning. Gets annoying. Reason for me buying it was the comb part for my daughter&#x27;s thicke hair. But this thing does not allow me to move as quickly as I would want. Smh I miss my old school blow dryer</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again!</li>
    <li> The blow dryer works like magic with the comb attached, I Just don&#x27;t how the comb nasal moves around from time to time. Other than that Im very pleased with item.</li>
    <li> Heats up  quickly and dries my hair very quickly but broke two of the teeth on the pick. The comb is not sturdy at all. I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have very thin, fine straight hair. This dryer doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair. It gives it volume and style. After all these years, I have found a dryer I can afford that really helps my hair and gets the job done very quickly.</li>
    <li> I simply love it. The different settings and the attachments. I only use the comb and low heat and my hair comes out great.</li>
    <li> I just received this hair dryer. I purchased it in an effort to support African American entrepreneurs..... The very first time I opened it today to blow dry my very thick hair,  sparks started flying 30 minutes in and it scared me to death.  I&#x27;m just speechless and very disappointed that Laila put her name on this product.</li>
    <li> Love it-  the comb attachment is extremely useful in getting my hair dry and straight. It&#x27;s light weight and easy to use</li>
    <li> The nozzle turns when im blowing drying... but i like.. ive adopted lol</li>
    <li> Blow dryers are suppose to be able to withstand being used for at least a period of time, but in under 20 minutes this  shorted out, also it created an electric spark. The spark came out of the area where you change the heat settings,can you say dangerous. Either I got a defective one, or it is just made cheaply. It&#x27;s a shame too because I didn&#x27;t get any use out of this, oh well, looks like I am back on my search for a good blow dryer-sigh!</li>
    <li> Ok, the attachments easily come off, and the high/med/low heat buttons are directly in the way of your hand placement as you dry your hair.  Which means you will accidentally turn the dryer off has you pull it threw your hair.  The heat and the drying quality is really good, but over all I&#x27;d recommend going with another vender.  You can just get a better bang for the buck.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have much money to spend on a blow dryer.  After reading reviews and realizing that it was within my budget, I decided to place my order.  It didn&#x27;t take long for me to get it.  It is easy to use, the hand grip is comfortable, and the heat settings are also nice.  The best part for me is sthat it is not heavy.  This cute gold &amp; purple dryer is perfect for my hair.  In less than 10-minutes, my hair is dry and I am ready to go.  This little dryer is powerful and I got it for cheap.  Thanks Amazon for offering this product.</li>
    <li> Like the power and hold.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent blow dryer at a great price. I&#x27;ve had this blow dryer for just over 4 months so far and use it 1-2 times per week. I was looking for a blow dryer with a comb attachment and this works wonderfully for me. The comb snaps on easily and stays securely in place. Not once have I had the comb fly off while I was blow drying my hair. It&#x27;s easy to clean. The blow dryer itself has three main settings: low, medium, and high. It also has a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; button that can be held down to have it just blow air without it being heated. I usually use the high setting and it takes me about 10-15 minutes to dry my medium-length, thick, relaxed hair. For me, it doesn&#x27;t feel excessively hot to the point of being uncomfortable on my scalp. It&#x27;s lightweight so I don&#x27;t have any problems holding my arms and shoulders up while using it. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it shorting out or sparking as other users have mentioned. This has been a great product for me!</li>
    <li> Thanks Laila for creating such a fantastic dryer with gals like us in mind.  Im transitioning to natural and this is my fav tool.</li>
    <li> It works with the comb attachment which is what I needed most. Perhaps, the designer name (Laila Ali) could be more permanent. After prolonged heat through the blow dryer nozzle and a few cleanings, the ink of the designer name rubbed off. Other than that, I like it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> My hair is coarse I have to hold the dryer at an angle to keep the comb on while drying my hair, but it works.</li>
    <li> The comb looks like it might soon break from the blower.  The connecting pieces are pretty flimsy.  Performs well.</li>
    <li> Not very heavy, dries hair very fast. Comes with dryer come and other accessories. I am thinking about getting her flat iron too.</li>
    <li> I started drying my hair and within 15 minutes it pooped out.  I waited 1/2 hour thinking that if it cooled down it would work again--not such luck.  I had to finish drying my hair with my old dryer.  It is ridiculous that you can&#x27;t even put the dryer on high to dry your hair quickly.  My old Conair finished the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bypass this one.</li>
    <li> It really blows hot. I enjoy having 3 settings. Also the gold part makes it easy to touch when hot. My only compliant is that it makes a shock or clicking noise when cutting it off straight from the high setting.</li>
    <li> Comb is not secure enough to comb through my tangled mess.</li>
    <li> 6 stars. my only problem is that it trips my electricity on high. the comb is great.</li>
    <li> This is just a good blowdryer. I gave it four stars because the on off slider easily turns off while blowdrying.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t give it any stars. It&#x27;s hard to slide the blower dryer on. This is my second one because as I was drying my daughter hair I went to turn it off and there was red spark and now this one did the same thing.</li>
    <li> Pretty good blow Dryer, shipping was as promised</li>
    <li> I love this dryer soooo much , but i don&#x27;t like that its a bit small but i can handle it and i like the fact its soo light weight nd it does my hair really well because my hairs is super thick and matted a bit so yea if i was you by it , its worth  the money then buying an &amp;#34; Hot n Gold &amp;#34; or &amp;#34; conair &amp;#34; witch can run from 25$ and on! and truthfully they don&#x27;t do good nd super thick or matted hair unless its premed and with this dryer u don&#x27;t have to have premed hair for it to come out look good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been reading that this product is inconvenient because the buttons are near the front of the bow dryer but if you know how to use a blow dryer your fingers won&#x27;t turn a switch on or off. and for those of you that are saying that the comb just pops out maybe you just have really really really coarse hair so maybe you should blow dry your hair slowly instead of maybe rushing through it because I&#x27;ve had this thing for about a week now and the comb did not pop off and I&#x27;m black! Lol so there&#x27;s that.</li>
    <li> I purchased this blow dryer to replace a Gold N Hot 1875 that is on it&#x27;s last leg.  I used it one time and was not impressed.  The pictures are deceiving.  The comb attachment is not wide toothed.  It takes it a long time to get really hot.  It took me 15 minutes longer to dry my hair than it normally does.  A waste of money is what it is...</li>
    <li> As an African American woman I am happy to be able to purchase products that keep us in mind. Thanks Laila Ali for making me feel good when spending my money on a product that has me in mind.  This is a really nice blow dryer by design and works well.</li>
    <li> I like this dryer very much, I have only used it once so far with and I used it with the comb attachment. I wish it came with a diffuser, because I need one and I am not sure what size to get because the dryer nozzle does seem very narrow. I will keep looking for a diffuser and take a try with a universal one.</li>
    <li> Great product! However my comb attachment always comes off while drying my hair, which can be annoying! The dryer gives great heat and works well straighten my natural hair, I wish the attachments were a bit more sturdy their on the cheap end but you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Love it! Works very nicely. Dries my hair fast so I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of damaging heat.</li>
    <li> Bought this blow dryer for my wife.It sparks and the comb attachment melted and tried finding replacement comb attachments but none fit.</li>
    <li> Not worth it. It started smoking when it was being used for the first time. I will not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love it! I have black hair...natural 4c hair and was looking for a dryer for occasional use. So far, I love it and the size is good for travelling. It&#x27;s not bulky or heavy. And it&#x27;s a great color and does not heat too much.</li>
    <li> Love it, I&#x27;ve used it twice and I&#x27;m a SUPER fan. Leaves my hair soft and straightens my hair better than any other dryer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Great product at a reasonable price Gets mt hair dry in little time.</li>
    <li> I wish that I didn&#x27;t have to give any stars because it deserves none. I will never buy this blow dryer again. I used it one time and it blow out while in my hand. I immediately dropped it because sparks flee everywhere. Im mad that I spent the money and couldn&#x27;t send it back.</li>
    <li> This has saved me lots of money. Works great</li>
    <li> This is a very stylish and easy to use blow dryer that gave me good results! It looks exactly as described in the photo.</li>
    <li> It works well by far one of the better hair dryers I have purchased, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had to give this 4 stars only because I do not like the on/off sliding button. I bought this because I really enjoyed my portable hair dryer from the Laila Ali line and my other blow dryer literally broke into pieces after years of hard work! ;-) I am hoping this stands the test of time.So far it works great!</li>
    <li> It was difficult to gauge whether this was a good product because of the mixed reviews. I regrettably aired on the side of optimism and am now in the process of retuning it after just two uses. The comb attachment not only kept popping off but the teeth are very flimsy and bent the second time I used it (although my hair is natural, it is not very coarse at all).  More important than any of that, the main reason I have give the dryer a poor review and immediately return it is due to the orange sparks I noticed when I changed the temperature setting. Admittedly, it dried my hair pretty fast (which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars) but it is absolutely NOT worth the risk!  KEEP LOOKING!!!</li>
    <li> If you are black woman with thick hair like myself do not buy because the comb part will come off easily.  Other than that I love it because it keeps my hair soft and shiny.  I just hope they solve that little problem.</li>
    <li> I gets pretty hot but not as hot as a doobie shop blow dryer</li>
    <li> love this item. Looks better in person. Thank You!</li>
    <li> Laila Ali LADR5601 Turbo Ionic Dryer, Purple and...&lt;br /&gt;Laila Ali</li>
    <li> This hair dryer gets really hot which is great and all but the first time i used it, it had sparks that scared me. I wasnt sure if it was going to catch on fire or not. And it still does that.</li>
    <li> Works just like any other blow drier, nothing special about it.</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve used another brand for years and I am very pleased with this one.</li>
    <li> I like this blow dryer although  the atachment click on.  I would have like it better if thy pushed on so I could just purchase a universal one if need be. Its very light also and I like that.</li>
    <li> I loved it completely straightened my hair.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is very pretty  and efficient.</li>
    <li> Very good. Awesome preformance for the price. I am not giving it 5 stars for a few minor things, it&#x27;s on the smaller side, the comb attachment is sort of flimsy and there was a pop when using it. Overall for the proce can&#x27;t  beat it.</li>
