      <li>I really love this powder, it&#x27;s great to use to get rid of residue oil on your face</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve had to use my own brushes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nice for eyeshadow...</li>
      <li>Over all nice product I would not re purchase because MAC has some highlighting products I like better</li>
      <li>/&gt;That said, I knew this had sparkle, but I decided to give it a try as there aren&#x27;t many products out there of this kind.  </li>
      <li>There are very fine sparkles when you look at the powder...</li>
      <li>I tried on a very light dusting and stepped over to window.  </li>
      <li>I must say that the powder is very light and fine...not makeupy looking like a mask.  </li>
      <li>I love the sparkle that blends</li>
      <li>I love it an use it often.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love Too</li>
      <li>, ELF&#x27;s body glow does a better job for all over the body</li>
      <li>I was looking for a facial illuminator for my wedding, and this product fills the bill perfectly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a luxury item for SURE, but all makeup to me is a luxury</li>
      <li>I normally love Too Faced products</li>
      <li>I love this powder.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s more like a highlighting powder.</li>
      <li>It seems many out there do not understand what an \\&quot;invisible\\&quot; powder is.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>You can wear it on top of foundation or blush or bronzer.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this product.  </li>
      <li>but this gives you a healthy beautiful glow that is far more noticeable and wearable.</li>
      <li>It seems to be a nice powder, i like thatits made with pure gold and the price was nice.</li>
      <li>However, I did buy this compact and was not disappointed!    </li>
      <li>the product is amazing ,It totally worth the money</li>
      <li>Faced looks good on anyone, as long as you know that you are seeking a girly appearance, with cute bronzers, my favorite being Snow Bunny (when in the compact the bronzer looks like Neopolitan ice cream!).  </li>
      <li>I have not used this product very much, but it is nice and gives a highlight of luminescence to your face.</li>
      <li>light on the face and a little shimmering perfect for a night on the town.</li>
      <li>but this is just too light for me.</li>
      <li>I use the Too Faced Candlelight Powder to set my concelear or for a light highlight.</li>
      <li>I use it where one might see light reflected on the face from candlelight...</li>
      <li>So, I just apply it lightly and that seems to keep the shimmer in check.</li>
      <li>It is fabulous for wearing indoors.  </li>
      <li>This bronzer looks fabulous when applied correctly...</li>
      <li>Sure enough, the powder is invisible, which is great and exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>The packaging is adorable also, this is my first Too Faced product</li>
      <li>Always youthful, fun appearance!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a FUN product, and you can play all you want without looking like a pancake face!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super smooth and does not feel like I am wearing anything.  </li>
      <li>special, tooo miniscule to be used in that area</li>
      <li>...use white just under highest part of eyebrow for a gorgeous glow, anywhere you want a pronouned and widened area.    </li>
      <li>She requested a translucent pressed face powder that she could quickly use while in between her spots on stage.</li>
      <li>It might work better later in the summer when my face becomes more tan.  </li>
      <li>Super Quality.</li>
      <li>A lot of girls wear fun but unnatural looking eyeliners or lip colors</li>
      <li>still recommend it, if you have the money to spend and want a fun product.  </li>
      <li>This is a very nice finishing powder to be used along the cheekbones and a small amount on the nose.</li>
      <li>Putting that aside i like the product very much and i will use it as it is a powder product</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have often looked at pretty women and thought what is it that they are doing and that im not?</li>
      <li>exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>It works exactly the way I had hoped it would.</li>
      <li>The powder is also soft and clean feeling and doesn&#x27;t give a greasy look.</li>
      <li>It really draws focus without being noticible and makes the eyes look brighter and more open when used along the cheek bones.</li>
      <li>Faced products because you never regret buying them and usually you get a superior result from the bronzers and powders.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a super SUPER light powder, with a little bit of illuminating flecks in it.  </li>
      <li>Super s soft glow, not a lot of coverage</li>
      <li>I would certainly purchase this product again</li>
      <li>I really does like</li>
      <li>I look airbrushed and magazine ready;</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really pretty-just not what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t grab it as much as my others but that&#x27;s because I have way to much makeup.</li>
      <li>However, there is more shimmer than I had expected.</li>
      <li>it says and gives a glow to your skin without putting on too much sparkle or shimmer.  </li>
      <li>This is not for young gals with pale skin, I think I will keep with my liquid foundation and a good blush..</li>
      <li>I was hoping for that illuminating experience that so many other reviewers had.  </li>
      <li>Maybe because I havent worn this powder with a full face of makeup is the reason why its only getting 3 stars out of me</li>
      <li>:)  It&#x27;ll set your makeup with a little bit of glowing look....but really, it depends on what you&#x27;re looking for in a makeup.  </li>
      <li>Your face will sparkle but only in direct light.  </li>
      <li>I think powder is for the young at heart, now someone with grey hair and light skin.  </li>
      <li>sometimes we want to look casual, such as in daylight, and this powder is fine enough to wear, or for a more glamorous occasion you can layer the glow, even adding a touch to your lips after lipstick to glow and soften your look...play with it!!    </li>
      <li>You can put as much as you want on, and it barely makes a difference in your complexion.  </li>
      <li>When I tried it at home it was mroe like an iridescent white and it wasn&#x27;t as pretty on.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good every day powder I&#x27;d skip this and look for something with a little less dazzle.</li>
      <li>Not too shimmery either, just a natural glow.</li>
      <li>I have tried it alone, and it does give me a soft glow.</li>
      <li>Natural and polished.</li>
      <li>so you look natural and creates a thinner width appearance...</li>
      <li>I like the way this product gives me a soft glow.  </li>
      <li>I love Too Faced products, but this one is not a good match for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Under cheeks and blush in an upward diagonal motion as you move outward will contour the face, use right under the chin and along jawline down for a slimming jawline appearance, along outward edges of face in hairline</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is good in theory, but the color pay off is basically none existent. I could dust this all over my face and notice no difference or luminosity. I would recommend liquid highlighters instead.</li>
    <li> the product is amazing ,It totally worth the money</li>
    <li> This is a very nice finishing powder to be used along the cheekbones and a small amount on the nose. It really draws focus without being noticible and makes the eyes look brighter and more open when used along the cheek bones.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Too Faced products because you never regret buying them and usually you get a superior result from the bronzers and powders.  Such is the case with this pressed powder!  I usually prefer loose powder, such as LeClerk, for my face because I need a very fine milled powder that won&#x27;t make me look crepey or dry skinned.  However, I did buy this compact and was not disappointed!    I must say that the powder is very light and fine...not makeupy looking like a mask.  There are very fine sparkles when you look at the powder...when on you are not sparkly but rather glow just like in candlelight!!  I use it where one might see light reflected on the face from candlelight...upper cheeks just under eye area in a slight U shape, abit on the round part of your chin, cheekbones, some on forehead blending towards each temple, add as desired look calls for...sometimes we want to look casual, such as in daylight, and this powder is fine enough to wear, or for a more glamorous occasion you can layer the glow, even adding a touch to your lips after lipstick to glow and soften your look...play with it!!    Too Faced looks good on anyone, as long as you know that you are seeking a girly appearance, with cute bronzers, my favorite being Snow Bunny (when in the compact the bronzer looks like Neopolitan ice cream!).  This bronzer looks fabulous when applied correctly...I would have a play party with it before wearing it out!  Under cheeks and blush in an upward diagonal motion as you move outward will contour the face, use right under the chin and along jawline down for a slimming jawline appearance, along outward edges of face in hairline so you look natural and creates a thinner width appearance...use pink and lighter shades to increase appearance, such as under eye and widest part of the cheek to create high cheekbones, some in the middle of forehead, some on chin.  Don&#x27;t swirl brown with pink, beige and white...use white just under highest part of eyebrow for a gorgeous glow, anywhere you want a pronouned and widened area.    Do yourself a favor and use Too Faced bronzers, powders, and they have great lipstick colors too!!  Always youthful, fun appearance!</li>
    <li> I use the Too Faced Candlelight Powder to set my concelear or for a light highlight. It&#x27;s a good product. I don&#x27;t grab it as much as my others but that&#x27;s because I have way to much makeup. It&#x27;s still a good product.</li>
    <li> Used this over foundation very nice</li>
    <li> It powder lasts well and works great as a finishing powder/highlighter. However, there is more shimmer than I had expected. I intended the use for every day work sort of thing. So, I just apply it lightly and that seems to keep the shimmer in check. But for a night out it&#x27;s perfect! The powder is also soft and clean feeling and doesn&#x27;t give a greasy look.</li>
    <li> looked all over for this product, great price</li>
    <li> Smelled rancid and like peanuts.</li>
    <li> I really love this powder, it&#x27;s great to use to get rid of residue oil on your face and it comes with an applicator</li>
    <li> Nice for eyeshadow... i woud only use it on my face for a night out...wasnt wht i expected and has ABSOLUTELY NO COVERAGE!! dont put this product on breakouts.  I found it enhances the imperfections of your skin, so dont buy with hopes of blurring them.</li>
    <li> I read every review of this product that I could find online before purchasing.  It seems many out there do not understand what an \\&quot;invisible\\&quot; powder is.  Sure enough, the powder is invisible, which is great and exactly what I was looking for.  It&#x27;s super smooth and does not feel like I am wearing anything.  It sets my makeup perfectly.  It&#x27;s everything that an invisible powder should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I knew this had sparkle, but I decided to give it a try as there aren&#x27;t many products out there of this kind.  It is fabulous for wearing indoors.  It will make your skin glow under the harsh fluorescent lighting.  It&#x27;s especially perfect for a night out.  However, I warn, do not wear this in the day!  I tried on a very light dusting and stepped over to window.  It was a partly sunny day and I sparkled like a Twilight Vampire!  I was shocked at how much glitter was covering my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still recommend it, if you have the money to spend and want a fun product.  If you&#x27;re looking for a good every day powder I&#x27;d skip this and look for something with a little less dazzle.</li>
    <li> This product illuminates my face with subtle shimmer. Great to set makeup after foundation. I would recommend this product to any woman. I would also buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I have tried it alone, and it does give me a soft glow. I have tried it with the rest of my makeup box and It blends everything in well. I look airbrushed and magazine ready; Natural and polished. I love the sparkle that blends in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have often looked at pretty women and thought what is it that they are doing and that im not? Well this is [one of] the items that I think pulls off the look. A lot of girls wear fun but unnatural looking eyeliners or lip colors but this gives you a healthy beautiful glow that is far more noticeable and wearable.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product.  I have used bare minerals for years and my finish was always dull.  Candlelight leaves you with a glow finish that last all day</li>
    <li> Maybe because I havent worn this powder with a full face of makeup is the reason why its only getting 3 stars out of me but I just don&#x27;t like the way this makes me look. It seems to be a nice powder, i like thatits made with pure gold and the price was nice. I&#x27;ll actually try this with primer foundation and all that and see if i like this...i tried using it on my decolletage and it wasnt anything special, tooo miniscule to be used in that area, ELF&#x27;s body glow does a better job for all over the body</li>
    <li> I love this powder.  It gives you a matte look, but still leaves you with a glow that makes you look refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began by only using it in the summertime when I had a natural tan from being at outdoor baseball games and the like.  However, I&#x27;ve now begun wearing it year around because I like the glow that it gives me in the winter as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*HIGHLY* recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This powder will give you a subtle, flattering shimmer. It is not glittery, so you do not have to worry about chunks of glitter or looking like a disco ball! I use mine with a kabuki brush on the perimeter of my face, a little on the bridge of the nose, and on the cheekbones. You can wear it on top of foundation or blush or bronzer. The packaging is adorable also, this is my first Too Faced product but it will not be my last! I do reccommend! ;)</li>
    <li> I was hoping for that illuminating experience that so many other reviewers had.  I love Too Faced products, but this one is not a good match for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the powder has a yellowish undertone.  This doesn&#x27;t work well with my coloring.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the applicator it comes with is a rubbery, stinky make-up pad.  I used it once and could smell the rubber scent on my skin.  I&#x27;ve had to use my own brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Third, it is simply not that illuminating.  I find it just looks like a power on my skin--but a yellow-y one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is possible that this product does not work for me becuase I am very fair.  It might work better later in the summer when my face becomes more tan.  For now, I&#x27;m not really using the product at all.</li>
    <li> I normally love Too Faced products but this is just too light for me. I thought it was an all over translucent powder but it&#x27;s more like a highlighting powder. It&#x27;s really pretty-just not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I like the way this product gives me a soft glow.  I have had it for a while and getting into the pan of the product it has become a bit hard.  Over all nice product I would not re purchase because MAC has some highlighting products I like better</li>
    <li> I have not used this product very much, but it is nice and gives a highlight of luminescence to your face.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. .my face looks amazing. .very light on the face and a little shimmering perfect for a night on the town. .I&#x27;m a fan of this product. .I &#x27;ll purchased it again. .</li>
    <li> Powder was all broken inside of compact very disappointed . Give it three stars because of this, otherwise powder was as described.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 18 y/o daughter.  She requested a translucent pressed face powder that she could quickly use while in between her spots on stage.</li>
    <li> Just a described! great!!! Fast shipping and exactly what I was looking for. Retails for $30 so great buy! I put on my cheek bones and around my eyes and I get a glowing look!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a makeup junkie, but I hate when women my age hide their skin under tons of makeup.  That&#x27;s why I like this product.  It&#x27;s a super SUPER light powder, with a little bit of illuminating flecks in it.  Your face will sparkle but only in direct light.  No one noticed I had it on except my sister, and keep in mind, she sees me everyday  and is also a makeup junkie, and she was standing about a foot away from me.  You can put as much as you want on, and it barely makes a difference in your complexion.  It&#x27;s a FUN product, and you can play all you want without looking like a pancake face!  It&#x27;s a luxury item for SURE, but all makeup to me is a luxury :)  It&#x27;ll set your makeup with a little bit of glowing look....but really, it depends on what you&#x27;re looking for in a makeup.  If you want coverage, this isn&#x27;t your thing!!</li>
    <li> The product itself is very gorgeous. I bought this for use as a subtle highlighter because i dont like the molton metal look of many other products out there. When i received it the powder looked as though someone scraped some off with their nail and at another place took a swatch to sample the product. Putting that aside i like the product very much and i will use it as it is a powder product but i am very disappointed in the conditon i received it.</li>
    <li> Super s soft glow, not a lot of coverage, I use it the set my BB cream</li>
    <li> This is basicly my fault, the color is way too pale for me and since my skin is pale.  I think powder is for the young at heart, now someone with grey hair and light skin.  This is not for young gals with pale skin, I think I will keep with my liquid foundation and a good blush.. Powder is for someone with NO wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I loved this when I tried it in the department store.  It make my shin glow in all the spots I wanted highlights.  When I tried it at home it was mroe like an iridescent white and it wasn&#x27;t as pretty on.  A little to much product goes too long a aways.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a facial illuminator for my wedding, and this product fills the bill perfectly. I had read some reviews that said this powder was too glittery, but I didn&#x27;t find that to be the case at all. Not too shimmery either, just a natural glow. I would buy this product again!</li>
    <li> This is a very subtle highlighter.  I really does like it says and gives a glow to your skin without putting on too much sparkle or shimmer.  I love it an use it often.</li>
    <li> Super Quality.The product is perfect. It works exactly the way I had hoped it would. I would certainly purchase this product again</li>
