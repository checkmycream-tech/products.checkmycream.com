      <li>Arrived very time and just as expected.</li>
      <li>It leaves my dry thick hair feeling silky smooth.</li>

<li> It leaves my dry thick hair feeling silky smooth.</li>
<li> but since I only wash my hair twice a week it will last a long time!</li>
<li> It feels pretty harsh and makes my hair feel like wire when is wet!!!</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair with shampooing.  </li>
<li> I first found it at my salon, but was unable to pay what they wanted to use it as my daily shampoo.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s not that my hair is less curly (I have curly days and straighter days depending on weather), it&#x27;s just less frizzy and shinier on a daily basis.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried Brazillian blowouts, fancy styles, and lots of other anti-frizz, shine serums, etc.&lt;br</li>
<li> Due to cost, I have to rotate between Aquage and other brands.</li>
<li> Certainly convenient but questionable business practices.  </li>
<li> its hard to find locally, so ordered it here.</li>
<li> I have thick, course hair and it softens it up immensely.  </li>
<li> I have very thick, coarse, colored hair</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been pretty appalled at them in general lately and will not be renewing my Prime membership nor will I be spending the $4000 per year I was.  </li>
<li> /&gt;After a few weeks of using this shampoo, I looked in the mirror and felt like I had salon hair.</li>
<li> not pleased with product</li>
<li> I bought it in the past  with my hairdresser</li>
<li> The &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; batch was purchased from Amazon LLC which is confusing.  </li>
<li> Hope the price decreases a little as it is quite expensive</li>

    <li> The best Aquage product on the market.  I have very thick, coarse, colored hair and this is the bes shampoo I have found (and I have tried many)!</li>
    <li> Good and clean.  Not harsh at all.  Will buy again. Would recommend to my friends.  Good on colored hair no dryness.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  I first found it at my salon, but was unable to pay what they wanted to use it as my daily shampoo.

    <li> Love this shampoo.  its hard to find locally, so ordered it here. will buy again, obviously</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, good price.</li>

    <li> This is a good shampoo for hair that won&#x27;t hold a curl and if in humidity.  I have to switch to another type often as it does tend to build up.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair, but not regular curly hair.  It&#x27;s corkscrew in different directions, with straight parts and frizzy parts.  I&#x27;ve tried Brazillian blowouts, fancy styles, and lots of other anti-frizz, shine serums, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks of using this shampoo, I looked in the mirror and felt like I had salon hair.

    <li> I love this shampoo. I bought it in the past  with my hairdresser, she turned me onto it. This is a good price too.</li>
    <li> I used to use Biomega and saw these and thought I would give them a chance.  Even though they are from the same product line this is far superior.  My hair is so soft and silky with this product and absolutely recommend to anyone else.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have thick, course hair and it softens it up immensely.  I have used everything and this is the best product I&#x27;ve tried.  That being said, I have ordered from two different sellers on Amazon.  The first batch was runny and not the same consistency as the last batch.  The thicker batch is a much better product and the consistency you would find in a real salon.  The &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; batch was purchased from Amazon LLC which is confusing.  You would think they buy from reputable wholesalers but I can guarantee you it wasn&#x27;t the same product. Amazon will not let you leave any seller feedback for them so I imagine this review will not be posted.  I&#x27;ve been pretty appalled at them in general lately and will not be renewing my Prime membership nor will I be spending the $4000 per year I was.  Certainly convenient but questionable business practices.  Can no longer support.</li>
    <li> I have used Aquage products for several years now and am pleased with how silky it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> my wife loves this product</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair with shampooing.  It keeps it hydrated and manageable.  I recommend it to everyone. Love it!</li>
