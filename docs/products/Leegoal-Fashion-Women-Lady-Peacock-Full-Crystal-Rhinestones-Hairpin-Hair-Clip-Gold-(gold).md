    <li> I bought this as a present for my mother and she absolutely loved it! It came on time and made my mother extremely happy. Would definitely recommend for uncertain buyers.</li>
    <li> I am a Cosmetologist..I have seen &amp; worked with all kinds of clips,headbands,ribbions,etc..this is a very classy hair clip...only thing is that the clip is Very Small...this is a very classy hair clip!!! Very Beautiful...&amp; the Crystals are extraordinary!!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful small but looks lovely in the hair. It is perfect size but I would like a larger one as well if I could get one.</li>
    <li> My hair clip arrived.It broke the first day I used it.very,very,very cheap thing.This is not worth writing more words ya</li>
    <li> Pretty, but too small.</li>
    <li> I should have read the ad better, I thought this would be a larger clip that what it is, it is the size of a medium bareete and will be unusable for me. Not a good idea for thick hair at all!</li>
    <li> The piece was perfect for my hair and the price was even better..... Thank you for the great deals, will continue to shop</li>
    <li> The picture is way better. Actual shape and design looks very very cheap, it just cheap product. It is made in China and this product was sent from china. It took forever to receive it. I do not recommend it. It is just cheap product and waste of several dollars.</li>
    <li> Beautiful.  I needed to add a littler glue to it because it was coming apart.  I think that is a good idea, anyway.  It is in your hair and you will be adjusting it.  It is very elegant.  I just wish it did not take so long to get here.  You have to remember it is coming from China.  It needs to makes several postal stops.  It also has to be picked apart for several inspections.  It was worth the wait.  I am going to see if they have something in Red or Green or, Blue for the Winter Holidays.  Buy a few.  I put it on top of a regular ponytail.  I did not feel regular.  Enjoy !</li>
    <li> Fell apart while wearing. Looked really cute at first but broke easily. Not fixable; tried glue - did not work. Maybe could solder but...nah!!!. Get what you pay for on this one!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful barrette but too small to hold a lot of hair.  Good for just maybe a side pull up of hair or for someone youonger.</li>
    <li> really pretty thank you</li>
    <li> Pretty piece but the clasp broke before I even used it once.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very pretty but very small and the colour is dull, not as bright or shiny as in the picture.</li>
    <li> This is a barrette not a clip.  I had ordered a different clip a while a go and loved it and wanted another.  The clips hold my hair better than a barrette.  This hair accessory is pretty but I was disapointed.  It was labeled as a clip and the picture showed a clip when I ordered.  They have changed the site now so I guess purchase cautiously.</li>
    <li> Much more beautiful in person, and holds the hair up very nicely. Will be buying more clips as gifts again.</li>
    <li> Small but adorable,I bought it for a 5year old</li>
    <li> Already fell apart and it is small I didn&#x27;t think that it was going to be that  small it took forever also it fell apart</li>
    <li> Nope. don&#x27;t bother. that big black beady eye is weird and it looks unpleasant. I wouldn&#x27;t wear it anywhere, seriously.</li>
    <li> very nice and classy. fits perfectly for my 10 y/o daughter. she loves to collect cute hairpins and clips, this one adds to her collection.</li>
    <li> Hair Barrett was delivered early. Very pretty. Only one small flaw. The fastener fell off right out the package &amp; the 1st time I wore it. Got a nice complement from a co-worker who loves peacocks. May be another sale. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Would have been a nice product it looks like the picture and wasn&#x27;t missing any stones. However I thought it would be bigger and the clip was broken off the back before It was even taken out of the plastic it was wrapped in so it&#x27;s useless. Lesson learned you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> this  broke on first use ,,,,,,no good!!!!!!!</li>
