      <li>I like the night light feature.</li>
      <li>It was never the most powerful hairdryer</li>

      <li>I liked it), nice physical design, and decent power.  </li>
      <li>Handy product for B &amp; Bs and for those who get up in the middle of the night since it has a night light.</li>
      <li>It is very bright and GREEN!</li>
      <li>VERY bright and VERY green.  </li>
      <li>first cost $90.00 and had no night light.  </li>
      <li>Looks good and works well, but the first one only lasted a year.  </li>
      <li>This is the second unit I&#x27;ve puchased like this, was very pleased with the first one.</li>
      <li>It keeeps the counter top clear of clutter, and you don&#x27;t have to unplug it and put it away each time.  </li>
      <li>BRIGHT night light (can be good or bad..</li>
      <li>So, I opened the back cover and stick the dark tape on the light screen to reduce the bright light.  </li>

      <li>I have used the Andis Hang-up Hairdryer for years, however, have had many problems with it overheating, having to send it back for repair or replacement.</li>
      <li>I would expect most hair dryers that are used lightly to last longer than this.</li>
      <li>First unit lasted two years and the switch gave out.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps we have to go back to putting one in a drawer and pulling it out as we did for many years before the flame thrower.</li>
      <li>First one lasted a year before burning out.  </li>
      <li>Plus, I am sure I&#x27;ll have to make new mounting holes and, patch and repaint over the old ones.</li>
      <li>Very handy, no worries about plugging it in since it&#x27;s hard wired to begin with.</li>
      <li>I thought the air volume still did not compete with most $15 standard dryers, but if you are not looking for big air volume, it is fine.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and overall</li>
      <li>Just a nice little device.</li>
      <li>The only way to turn off light is to press Test buttom and press Reset buttom when you needed to use, which is very inconvenience.  </li>
      <li>hair dryers should not take this much thought.</li>
      <li>LOVE THAT I DON&#x27;T HAVE TO DRAG THE BLOW DRYER OUT EVERY MORNING.  </li>
      <li>For the price, I feel it is very satisfactory.  </li>

      <li>that&#x27;s right near your ear.</li>
      <li>Those mid-night visits are safe and lighted - no fumbling around with those other &#x27;soft-lights&#x27;.</li>
      <li>Not a soft glow like you would expect a night light to be.</li>
      <li>There are not many wall mount hair dryers to pick from, and I mostly liked this one while it worked.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t wait to get another one when I re-do main bathroom.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Looks good and works well, but the first one only lasted a year.  I took the first one apart and found that the on/off-heat selector switch is very cheap and simply wore out.  I only bought the 2nd one because I already have the mounting plate on the wall and thought I might take another chance (hoping that they have improved the switch)).  Guess we will see how long the new one will last.</li>
    <li> First unit lasted two years and the switch gave out.  From reviews and comments online this seems to be a constant theme.  But, since we had the holes on the wall, we gave it another try.  Second one, just one one year, and flames came out of the dryer and actuallly singed hair.  One year and one month so warranty doesn&#x27;t matter.  On the other hand, I am not sure I want more burnt hair.  I will have to find some other solution to hair drying.  The portable dryers we have, some well over 20 years old, seem to work when called upon.  Perhaps we have to go back to putting one in a drawer and pulling it out as we did for many years before the flame thrower.</li>
    <li> Very easy to mount to the wall. Plenty of power.  The night light is a nice feature when entering the bathroom at night.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll need to close the bathroom door, this night light is bright.  Hair dryer is equally impressive: lightweight, compact, 3 speeds.  Good choice for the home.</li>
    <li> We have had this model on our wall for years.  Then we started buying them from Amazon vice other catalogs/sources.  Two in two years.  Current one purchased July 2006 and broke Nov 2006.  These have faulty switches that melt and/or deform.  WARRANTY?????  First one from Amazon did last 18 months or so.</li>
    <li> I bought this hari dryer about 2.5 years ago. I liked the fact that it was mounted and had the night light. It was never the most powerful hairdryer but I generally only dry my bangs and just fluff the water off the top of the curls, so I wasn&#x27;t that worried about it. If I was pulling and straightening my hair every day, this would not have been enough power. That said, it worked fine for what I needed. However, today it started to spark. This is not hard wired, its just a plug in model. I was pretty surprised because it gave no other indication that it was wearing out. I would expect most hair dryers that are used lightly to last longer than this. Too bad.     Considering the higher price tag for the wall mounted version and the short life of the product, I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews, but I wanted to warn others of my experience which seems to be very common with this hair dryer.  There are not many wall mount hair dryers to pick from, and I mostly liked this one while it worked.  BRIGHT night light (can be good or bad.. I liked it), nice physical design, and decent power.  I thought the air volume still did not compete with most $15 standard dryers, but if you are not looking for big air volume, it is fine. My wife misses a \\&quot;cold\\&quot; button.  So in all, a mediocre hair dryer but with great wall mount convenience and bright night light.  Now with the issues... Bought 18 months ago, worked fine except overheated very easily. If used on HIGH, it would run as long as you want till you shut it off, then the internal temperature would apparently overheat with no more airflow, and would refuse to turn back on for 5 minutes or so.  Annoying, but I got used to it by going to medium heat for about 10 seconds before shutting it off every time.  That seemed to cool it down just enough not to trigger the temperature limiter in case I needed to turn it back on right away.  I probably would have pitched it, but I liked the wall mount convenience and put 4 holes in my wall to mount it.  Well, here we are 18 months of life, and now it is completely dead. Night light on but the hair dryer is not home. I am electrically capable and could probably open up and fix this thing, but it is not worth the safety concern.  If you want to pay a premium for wall mount, just know you might only get a year or two out of it.. others seems to have similar experiences.  Sad that the $10 hand held models seem to last much longer.  Anyway, to cover up the holes in the walls, I am trying one of the other few wall mount options out there by another manufacturer. If this one dies, I am giving up on wall mount.  Good luck... hair dryers should not take this much thought.</li>
    <li> This week, our second Andis wall mounted dryer burned out.  After our first failure, I always checked and cleaned it out on a regular basis.  Prior to complete unit failure, the internal thermal protection would turn the unit off prior to my wife finishing her hair.  It would typically work again the next day.  The first one lasted about 3 month, the second one about 8 months.  I have another model from a different manufacturer in my bath and it has worked for over 10 years.  We purchased this one because of the claim to produce less noise (not really) and the night light.  The night light could be too bright for some, but it was OK for us.  I just order another wall mount from a different manufacturer.  In less than 1 year, I will be $120+ for one hair dryer.  Not good value.  Plus, I am sure I&#x27;ll have to make new mounting holes and, patch and repaint over the old ones.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer to replace my burned out Andis Pro Turbo 1600W which was very old.  I have been using these dryers for many years and LOVE them.  I could replace this unit without removing the metal plate that was attached to the wall.  I love this feature.  The only thing I would have done differently is maybe buying the one that does not have the night light.  The night light is great for people who like night lights but I like total darkness when I sleep.  Just an overall excellent product!!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0009XH6XC Andis 33700 Hangup Pro Turbo 1600W Wall Mount Hair Dryer with Night Light]]  Replace a nearly decade old unit that just finally wore out.  Works great. Wish the night light was not quite so bright.</li>
    <li> This is the second unit I&#x27;ve puchased like this, was very pleased with the first one. Very handy, no worries about plugging it in since it&#x27;s hard wired to begin with. The first unit is about five yrs old now with perfect performance...    Tops St. Louis</li>
    <li> This is a very good product.  I have been using over a month.  It has enough power to blow your hair faster.  However, the night light caused everyone a little uncomfortable.  The light was too bright when I pluged the power.  The only way to turn off light is to press Test buttom and press Reset buttom when you needed to use, which is very inconvenience.  So, I opened the back cover and stick the dark tape on the light screen to reduce the bright light.  I wish there is a dimm switch to adjust light.</li>
    <li> This item was shipped on time, easy to track and works great. Been very pleased with this item</li>
    <li> Handy product for B &amp; Bs and for those who get up in the middle of the night since it has a night light.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a wall mounted ionic hair dryer and this fit the bill.  Certainly not the best dryer but there&#x27;s not much to chose from in what I was looking for.  Certainly better than Bion hair dryer that I just trashed.  The night light is nice but a little too bright.</li>
    <li> How annoying is a hair dryer that you never have space to store?!  With this wall mounted one - you never have to be annoyed again.  It&#x27;s on the wall and out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to install if you can drill.  I love it!!!</li>
    <li> No more mess in the kids bathroom. They love it and so do I. No problem with dryer strength. Lots of hair on both.</li>
    <li> Easy to install on wall but requires some drilling.  Three heat settings work well but I would like to have a setting that is \\&quot;air only\\&quot; like my old dryer had.  Night light is green but throws enough light to see way around bathroom at night.  No way to turn night light off.</li>
    <li> Plenty of power. Plenty of heat. Like the night light, but would like to be able to switch it off if I wanted ... but can&#x27;t do that. If I kept this near my ears for a long time, the noise would be an issue, but since I don&#x27;t, it isn&#x27;t. Just a nice little device.</li>
    <li> This is the nicest hair dryer we have ever owned. &lt;br /&gt;this is number 3 we have purchased over the last 10 years. &lt;br /&gt;the first cost $90.00 and had no night light.  &lt;br /&gt;Now we buy the ones with the led night light uses little to no electricity. the dyrer is wonderfull. we bought it because the hotel we stayed in florida had them and thought what a great idea. no more wires or the unit on the counter. we also thought it must be good for everday use by different types of people. we really love it. &lt;br /&gt;It will go into our new 2 baths so I will be buying two more soon.</li>
    <li> It has two power settings but need a hex head to change the setting. Also didn&#x27;t like the mounting bracket. The night light stays on all the time instead of having a night sensor.  Love the housing for the dryer but the reset button does not seem sturdy. With few improvements and I would give this dryer 5 Stars.</li>
    <li> Having a wall mounted hairdryer is great.  It keeeps the counter top clear of clutter, and you don&#x27;t have to unplug it and put it away each time.  It has plenty of power, at least for my thin hair.  I have to run it in the 2nd setting, as the third setting is a little to hot.</li>
    <li> I like the wall mount; the green oval nightlight is useful but silly during the day; it blows cool-ish air and in my opinion - it&#x27;s very loud. Not good for someth that&#x27;s right near your ear. Too bad, otherwise as expected.</li>
    <li> My wife just loves this hair dryer - so convenient - no more hauling the old one out from under the sink, unplugging the nite-lite, etc.  And the nite-lite is great!  Those mid-night visits are safe and lighted - no fumbling around with those other &#x27;soft-lights&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I purchased this for my mother and she tells me it is probably the best one she has ever used.</li>
    <li> I  have had a several Andis wall mount hair dryers and never had a problem. However, my last purchase was the model with the built-in night light.  The night light is green and stays on all the time. I thought this was pretty nice.  HOWEVER, THIS MODEL IS A FIRE HAZARD!!!  After several days being plugged in, my husband and I returned home to find the a terrible burning smell in the bathroom.  We immediately unplugged the unit.  When my husband opened the hairdryer,the parts connected to the nightlight were all burned and charred.  He was able to disconnect that portion and the unit is fine now.  I cannot think of what we would have found had if we were away for a longer period of time.  I think this would  have definitely caused a fire.  Andis makes a good hairdryer -- JUST NOT THIS MODEL.</li>
    <li> Love the hair dryer but wish I would have gotten one without the \\&quot;night light\\&quot;.  The night light is more like a beacon.  VERY bright and VERY green.  Not a soft glow like you would expect a night light to be. I ended up placing paper over the light to tone it down since there seems no way to turn it off or disable it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  Very satisfied with the actual dryer and love that it hangs on the wall and is not in the way like most dryers.</li>
    <li> I have used the Andis Hang-up Hairdryer for years, however, have had many problems with it overheating, having to send it back for repair or replacement. When I received this hairdryer purchased from Amazon, it arrived defective as the switch to turn it off does not work.  It only turns off when returned to the holder on the wall.  I will have to return this for repair.  I do like the convenience of the wall hairdryer - just would like to find a more reliable product.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled when I found this item at Amazon.com becasue I had always wanted a hair dryer to mount on the wall. I decided to use it before I had it mounted to check it out. After 5 minutes it just stoped working. I packed it up and sent it back. I would not judge every dryer made by this company by this one, I may have just got a hold of a lemon.</li>
    <li> I have purchased two of these units.  First one lasted a year before burning out.  Thought it was the way my wife was using it that was the problem so I purchase another one and it now it is an expensive night light.  It shuts off when using and she cannot completely dry her hair.</li>
    <li> I have owned three of these dryers during the past 10 years -- same models.  I love the convenience of hanging on the wall, and I have enjoyed the features.  For the price, I feel it is very satisfactory.  It is easy to use and overall, I am happy with the product.</li>
    <li> LOVE THAT I DON&#x27;T HAVE TO DRAG THE BLOW DRYER OUT EVERY MORNING.  ITS THERE AND READY WHEN I NEED IT.</li>
    <li> Great blowdryer!!  I bought this for my master bath since I was redecorating.  Lots of power and heat for a 1600 watt.  The wall mount is absolutely terrific - feel like I&#x27;m in a hotel bathroom :-).  The night light is green and some may not like this but it fits in with my decor so I like it.  Can&#x27;t wait to get another one when I re-do main bathroom.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Ideal cord length, built in GFI and a NIGHTLIGHT !  Major points with my wife and I&#x27;m promoting them to my friends.  Told my hairstylist about it yesterday!  No regrets.</li>
    <li> This is the second Andis hair dryer that I have purchased because I like it so much. When we remodeled our bathroom, this is the hairdryer that came to mind. I like the night light feature. It is very bright and GREEN! The dryer has plenty of power and has an adjustable heat setting. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. Our first one is at least 20 years old and we are now using it in a different bathroom.</li>
    <li> Hair dryer works great.&lt;br /&gt;Mounting plate was a little bit tricky to install though / could have a better design.&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, a satisfactory purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this several years ago for my wife.  The bathroom counter top is always cluttered with stuff she uses to get ready in the morning.  When I saw this I thought it would help.  It did and it&#x27;s easy to install.  Still working with no shortage of performance. No signs that it is wearing out but when it does I will replace it with another one!</li>
    <li> The night light is very powerful, which is good.  The bad thing is, there is no way to toggle the light without unplugging it.  I mean, they could have easily added a light/dark sensor so that it would cycle on and off as needed.  It does have nice UMPH as a dryer, but again, it could have been better.</li>
    <li> I like this hairdryer.  This one replaced our old one.  Our experience is that they only last about two or three years before needing to be replaced.  This is the third one we&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
    <li> I liked it but ended up returning b/c it was a bit heavy for my arthritic hands.</li>
    <li> I brought two other ones for the bathrooms. Now every quest can use these and it hangs on wall nicely.</li>
