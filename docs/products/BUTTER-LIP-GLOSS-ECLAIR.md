      <li>REALLY GOOD.</li>
      <li>Not that shiny gloss still feels good.</li>
      <li>However I will say the texture is very smooth and creamy and feels great on the lips.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>But it goes amazingly over lipstick.</li>
      <li>The smell of this gloss is simply amazing.</li>
      <li>It would look better on a person who has more tan skin than fair skin.</li>
      <li>Both are very natural looking and feels wonderful on!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s near perfect!!  </li>
      <li>Love love love this color!</li>
      <li>You really need to have smooth exfoliated lips for the best application.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite glosses.</li>
      <li>The color was ok but not with my skin color.</li>
      <li>They have better staying-power and more pigmentation.</li>
      <li>I buy a lot of lipgloss of all different kinds and this product is one of the best.</li>
      <li>My favorite of all the nyx butter glosses.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the formulation of these glosses.</li>
      <li>really love the eclair one .......</li>
      <li>This is a very nice color but very sticky.</li>
      <li>I use it over my lipstick and it has pretty good staying power.  </li>
      <li>With a light application it reminds me of the light pinkish nude lips that were so popular in the 60&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>all in all i would have to say I will use it for sure in special event settings.</li>
      <li>The color is sheer but beautiful.</li>
      <li>Fine for the price but literally lasts an hour or until you drink something.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping , secured package, amazing product.</li>
      <li>It was smooth feeling</li>
      <li>For me, it is too light to wear without lipstick underneath.  </li>
      <li>The texture of this product is silky smooth.</li>
      <li>I love so much.</li>
      <li>I love this gloss, it really is like butter on your lips</li>
      <li>This particular color is a very light pink/nude shade.</li>
      <li>It definitely has good coverage and a pretty color.</li>
      <li>This gloss looks and feels so beautiful on the lips, it&#x27;s probably my favorite out of the only other one I purchased which was creme brûlée.</li>
      <li>the color is not too bright even though its a pink gloss.</li>
      <li>This is a nice product overall, but I  prefer the NYX xtreme lip creams.</li>
      <li>I found that this product faded off pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>and I love rose colors they usually flatter me</li>
      <li>Major compliments from cute boys when I wear this lipgloss ;)</li>
      <li>I was not disappointed It was exactly what I expected I will be ordering more</li>
      <li>Love this, definitely in my favorites!</li>
      <li>, this is a nice &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; pink.</li>
      <li>A nice light near neutral pink.</li>
      <li>The butter gloss are great for pigmention but the stickness of it sucks.</li>
      <li>Not too wet, gives a nice gloss to the lips.  </li>
      <li>The fact that it&#x27;s slimy combined with the strange unflattering shade makes this a product I won&#x27;t be buying more of.</li>
      <li>It makes me wonder what is going on.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, do the names imply a certain taste?</li>
      <li>Really like this gloss.  </li>
      <li>And really doesn&#x27;t have any color.</li>
      <li>I really like this.</li>
      <li>Very angelic with a hint of sassiness.</li>
      <li>So rich feeling; definitely lives up to its name!!  </li>
      <li>It seems to have a little more opaque pigment to me than some of them have had.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very mositurizing and leaves your lips soft.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t feel sticky or gritty like other lip glosses, and they are so smooth!</li>
      <li>I am surprised by the rave reviews of this product across the board.</li>
      <li>If you like a natural lip and don&#x27;t mind</li>
      <li>Plus it arrived extremely fast, will definitely buy products again.</li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>When you remove the gloss it leaves your lips feeling so soft.</li>
      <li>It has a soft matt gloss finish...</li>
      <li>Overall I love this product and have purchased several other colors as well.</li>
      <li>So many glosses are a little too pink or have a tinge of orange or color which I do not like</li>
      <li>Totally wearable for professional setting to dinner and drinks with friends.</li>
      <li>It has a soft yet shiny pink look and last for a normal amount of time.</li>
      <li>but if you apply too much it gets a little gloppy.</li>

<li> The only downsize is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long on your lips</li>
<li> The only thing bad I could say about it is it isn&#x27;t completely opaque on my lips, although I&#x27;ve heard many people say it is for them.</li>
<li> I used mine all day today owing to the fact it wound up being the only one in my purse for some reason and my lips were dry.</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re not sure which color to go with, I highly suggest this one.</li>
<li> but it doesnt dry out</li>
<li> If you have dry or chapped lips at all it does not work well.</li>
<li> And at the end of the day my lips were so dry</li>
<li> but this was a bit to pink for my taste.</li>
<li> so if you dont like wet lips</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never really tried lip gloss with a texture quite like this one.  </li>
<li> Eclair is such a delicate sheer pink.</li>
<li> Not really worth it for me</li>
<li> I recieved it today, which is a few days ahead of expected date.</li>
<li> Just a slight tent of pink for a little Pop of color.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The butter gloss are great for pigmention but the stickness of it sucks. If there was no sticky lipgloss  it would one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> Very nice lip gloss smells heavenly.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product overall, but I  prefer the NYX xtreme lip creams. They have better staying-power and more pigmentation. I found that this product faded off pretty quickly. However I will say the texture is very smooth and creamy and feels great on the lips. If you like a natural lip and don&#x27;t mind re-applying lip gloss often, this is for you.</li>
    <li> I bought two different shades...  Creme Brulee and Eclair.  So rich feeling; definitely lives up to its name!!  Eclair is such a delicate sheer pink. And Creme Brulee is almost one shade deeper than my lip color! It&#x27;s near perfect!!  Both are very natural looking and feels wonderful on!  They arrived a day later than promised but I&#x27;m still very pleased!!</li>
    <li> I recieved it today, which is a few days ahead of expected date. It&#x27;s somewhat like my MAC snob lipgloss, its not as thick though. I love it!</li>
    <li> I really like this. Just a slight tent of pink for a little Pop of color.</li>
    <li> Great lipgloss and I am obsessed with this color! If you&#x27;re not sure which color to go with, I highly suggest this one.</li>
    <li> Recently purchased this lipgloss and I haven&#x27;t stopped wearing it since. The texture of this product is silky smooth. No clumps or sticky feeling. Very angelic with a hint of sassiness. Totally wearable for professional setting to dinner and drinks with friends. Major compliments from cute boys when I wear this lipgloss ;)</li>
    <li> This is a very nice color but very sticky. It is also moisturizing on my lips. The color is sheer but beautiful. I love just tossing this in my purse because it is perfect for all occasions.</li>
    <li> This gloss I got and I love rose colors they usually flatter me but this was a bit to pink for my taste. It was smooth feeling but it doesnt dry out so if you dont like wet lips then i dont recommend this for you. all in all i would have to say I will use it for sure in special event settings.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never really tried lip gloss with a texture quite like this one.  The fact that it&#x27;s slimy combined with the strange unflattering shade makes this a product I won&#x27;t be buying more of.</li>
    <li> This gloss looks and feels so beautiful on the lips, it&#x27;s probably my favorite out of the only other one I purchased which was creme brûlée. Definitely not my last!</li>
    <li> This is lip gloss with a great price and a nice shine!  NYX Butter Lip Gloss has not taste...which is great!  It is also long-lasting.  On the down-side, it has that sticky feel a lot of the lower priced lip glosses have.  It definitely has good coverage and a pretty color.</li>
    <li> Love love love this color! It&#x27;s very mositurizing and leaves your lips soft. The only downsize is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long on your lips so you have to keep reapplying.</li>
    <li> THESE NYX BUTTER GLOSSES ARE ABSOLUTELY AMAZING !! THEY ARE SO PIGMETNED AND SMEEL REALLY GOOD. GREAT OVERTOP ANY LIPSTICK AND SUPER SHINY !!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ACTUALLY DO YOUTUBE MAKEUP VIDS (kimkreations p) AND I LITERALLY USE ADLEAST ONE OF THESE EACH TIME ! I HAVE THEM IN ALL THE COLORS !!</li>
    <li> it smells good glides on it&#x27;s perfect I was not disappointed It was exactly what I expected I will be ordering more</li>
    <li> Arrived perfectly on time. Not that shiny gloss still feels good. (Reviewed by my wife)</li>
    <li> I buy a lot of lipgloss of all different kinds and this product is one of the best. It has a soft yet shiny pink look and last for a normal amount of time. Perfect amount of stickiness. Plus it arrived extremely fast, will definitely buy products again.</li>
    <li> This color is beautiful!! The only thing bad I could say about it is it isn&#x27;t completely opaque on my lips, although I&#x27;ve heard many people say it is for them. But it goes amazingly over lipstick. They don&#x27;t feel sticky or gritty like other lip glosses, and they are so smooth! Love this, definitely in my favorites!</li>
    <li> I love this gloss, it really is like butter on your lips lol. I&#x27;m hoping to collect all of them. really love the eclair one ....... definitely recommend these butter glosses.</li>
    <li> Wow. I am surprised by the rave reviews of this product across the board. I&#x27;ve looked at a few sites and they all rave about this product, practically hands down. It makes me wonder what is going on.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, do the names imply a certain taste? Mine just smells kinda like cotton candy and tastes like nothing. It goes on gloopy and sticky. And really doesn&#x27;t have any color. I used mine all day today owing to the fact it wound up being the only one in my purse for some reason and my lips were dry. I had to keep applying it all the time. And at the end of the day my lips were so dry I resorted to  slathering on Vaseline lip therapy which I despise because it is so gloopy but I had to protect my lips somehow and the only thing worse than this stuff is the Avon stuff they have taken to shilling at work so I wound up buying some. That crap (the Avon) went right in the trash, followed by this Nyx stuff. Did I just get a bad batch or something?</li>
    <li> Free Shipping and Great price!</li>
    <li> My favorite of all the nyx butter glosses. A nice light near neutral pink. Can&#x27;t go wrong. So many glosses are a little too pink or have a tinge of orange or color which I do not like, this is a nice &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; pink.</li>
    <li> Fine for the price but literally lasts an hour or until you drink something. Not really worth it for me</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the formulation of these glosses. This gloss is not too sticky or tacky. When you remove the gloss it leaves your lips feeling so soft. The smell of this gloss is simply amazing. It reminds me of cake or buttercream frosting. It seems that the color payoff of these varies from shade to shade. You can build the color up slightly but if you apply too much it gets a little gloppy. This particular color is a very light pink/nude shade. It seems to have a little more opaque pigment to me than some of them have had. The application can be a little tricky as the doe foot wand leaves the color a little streaky. I find that pressing my lips together smooths and evens out the color. This color can tend to settle into the lines on your lips. If you have dry or chapped lips at all it does not work well. You really need to have smooth exfoliated lips for the best application. With a light application it reminds me of the light pinkish nude lips that were so popular in the 60&#x27;s. Overall I love this product and have purchased several other colors as well.</li>
    <li> I love so much. Fast shipping , secured package, amazing product. I highly reccomend if you looking for a everyday lipgloss. Beautiful.</li>
    <li> The color was ok but not with my skin color. It would look better on a person who has more tan skin than fair skin.</li>
    <li> loveeee allll the butterglosses</li>
    <li> Really like this gloss.  Its shiny and not sticky!</li>
    <li> This is just a wonderful lip gloss.....the color is not too bright even though its a pink gloss. It has a soft matt gloss finish...Love it!!</li>
    <li> This gloss is very nice.  I use it over my lipstick and it has pretty good staying power.  Not too wet, gives a nice gloss to the lips.  For me, it is too light to wear without lipstick underneath.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite glosses.</li>
