      <li>Happy and pleased customer!</li>
      <li>He LOVED it</li>
      <li>The packaging was appropriate and the item looks great.  </li>
      <li>The gods are now pleased!</li>
      <li>and I think it smells nice.</li>
      <li>Nice product came as described.</li>
      <li>It was packaged nicely as well.</li>
      <li>Super happy with this product.</li>
      <li>This is my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite cologne</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so happy it came fast.</li>
      <li>but hey, it smells freaking fantastic!</li>
      <li>it has a nice light smell which is not over powering.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a fancy smell; which my blue collar son likes, but it&#x27;s still a pleasant woodsy smell and good for dress up occasions.</li>
      <li>While I have no clue how to describe smells accurately, I believe it&#x27;s more on the citrus side of smells</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this is just me, but the smell is not something I enjoy smelling throughout the day.</li>
      <li>Not as strong like the original.</li>
      <li>LIGHTLY*</li>
      <li>The item arrived on time and was shipped securely.  </li>
      <li>so I was sooo excited to find it for such a great price for Christmas</li>
      <li>Never fails to impress the ladies  when I&#x27;m out :-)</li>
      <li>and she is just right, too!</li>
      <li>Ordered two Bottles all delivered quickly and without damage.  </li>
      <li>Some ladies say the original is too loud and this is just right!</li>
      <li>thank you very much</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for</li>
      <li>First thing my son said was...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I ordered as a gift.</li>
      <li>Is my Favorite brand overall</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s aroma is reminiscent of a cologne from many years ago.  </li>
      <li>For years, I was an Old Spice man til I discovered original Stetson.</li>
      <li>Cologne was much cheaper than at stores even WalMart.  </li>
      <li>My husband absolutely loves this cologne</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>Not bad, but not better than most.</li>
      <li>Sometimes, nothing can shoot a man down like a fine lady dissing his style!</li>
      <li>My favorite cologne hands down.</li>
      <li>We all have a preference that we associate with scent and this one was new to me, so there&#x27;s that.</li>
      <li>For a cologne that is so low in price, this smells better than most expensive ones.</li>
      <li>This is my 2nd favorite Stetson behind the original.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;thank you for not buying Old Spice&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>the fragrance stays with you a long time and can be over powering if too much is applied.</li>

<li> do not last long efough.</li>
<li> At 26 years old it&#x27;s hard for him to fess up to it being Stetson</li>
<li> A little goes a long way...</li>
<li> a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> so I knew anything with Polo or some other posh put-on would turn him off.</li>
<li> Stetson Black is one of my favorites.  </li>
<li> However, Stetson Black is understated, like me</li>
<li> Not too expensive and drives the women wild, I bought 8 bottles at one go...</li>
<li> for the past seven years.</li>

    <li> Cologne was much cheaper than at stores even WalMart.  Ordered two Bottles all delivered quickly and without damage.  Will definitely order from Amazon again.</li>
    <li> Not bad, but not better than most. We all have a preference that we associate with scent and this one was new to me, so there&#x27;s that.</li>
    <li> Not too expensive and drives the women wild, I bought 8 bottles at one go...should last 10 years! The gods are now pleased!</li>
    <li> For a cologne that is so low in price, this smells better than most expensive ones. My favorite cologne hands down.</li>
    <li> This is my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite cologne so I got him this for Christmas. He LOVED it and I think it smells nice. It was packaged nicely as well.</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time and was shipped securely.  The packaging was appropriate and the item looks great.  Everything was as advertised.  Happy and pleased customer!</li>
    <li> My husband had this laying around the house and finally decided to wear it. He&#x27;s been getting compliments on it ever since! At 26 years old it&#x27;s hard for him to fess up to it being Stetson but hey, it smells freaking fantastic!</li>
    <li> it has a nice light smell which is not over powering.  I use it daily for work. Not as strong like the original.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cologne *LIGHTLY* for the past seven years. Never fails to impress the ladies  when I&#x27;m out :-)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I ordered as a gift. The item came as promised and packaged well. No issues at all.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd favorite Stetson behind the original. Some ladies say the original is too loud and this is just right! Yes, I date Goldilocks and she is just right, too! For years, I was an Old Spice man til I discovered original Stetson. Sometimes, nothing can shoot a man down like a fine lady dissing his style! However, Stetson Black is understated, like me and she is on board the S-train again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this is just me, but the smell is not something I enjoy smelling throughout the day. While I have no clue how to describe smells accurately, I believe it&#x27;s more on the citrus side of smells and it gives me a headache.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for 8 years. Great product!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. A little goes a long way...the fragrance stays with you a long time and can be over powering if too much is applied.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this on me!!</li>
    <li> First thing my son said was...&amp;#34;thank you for not buying Old Spice&amp;#34; which he gets from everyone else. It&#x27;s not a fancy smell; which my blue collar son likes, but it&#x27;s still a pleasant woodsy smell and good for dress up occasions. My son is a no-nonsense type working guy so I knew anything with Polo or some other posh put-on would turn him off.</li>
    <li> Hubby loves this cologne and so do I!</li>
    <li> Super happy with this product. It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for and I&#x27;m so happy it came fast. I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for this smell thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> My husband absolutely loves this cologne so I was sooo excited to find it for such a great price for Christmas</li>
    <li> Stetson Black is one of my favorites.  It&#x27;s aroma is reminiscent of a cologne from many years ago.  I like it.</li>
    <li> yes i like the larger bottoles .75 do not last long efough. thank you very much</li>
    <li> Nice product came as described. Have used for years and the spray bottles are favorites of mine as you get just a touch that way. a little goes a long way. Is my Favorite brand overall and i am complimented and asked what it is all the time.</li>
