      <li>I feel that it does a good job moisturizing without being greasy .</li>
      <li>The generous sample lasted 4 days - and I loved the product, so..</li>
      <li>honestly can&#x27;t say this is all that great.  </li>
      <li>This feels good and smells good.  </li>
      <li>Would have loved it to work for me.</li>
      <li>It does a good job at moisturizing and tightening skin a bit, as well as evening out complexion.</li>
      <li>This product applies beautifully, has a trace scent of &amp;#34;yummy&amp;#34; but not overpowering, and has ingredients that it can boast about and feel glad to print (no animal testing besides).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Acure products!!</li>
      <li>My face feels healthy and nourished with each use and for a 1/3 of the cost too!</li>
      <li>my favorite thing in the world!</li>
      <li>I love the feel and smell of this product, but it did not agree with my skin at all!</li>
      <li>Since I started using this, it&#x27;s amazing to me</li>
      <li>but this is by far the best line I have used.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe the strong lavender smell!</li>
      <li>You will be glad you did.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Love this night cream &amp; it has no harmful ingredients.</li>
      <li>I like better.  </li>
      <li>For sure, the eye cream has something in it that causes hives to break out all around my eye area.</li>
      <li>I was more concerned about performance, however.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand this love affair with lavender.</li>
      <li>I was so impressed by this cream that I didn&#x27;t even bother to finish what was left over in my Estee Lauder bottle.</li>
      <li>I love this night cream</li>
      <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love the Acure cleanser and eye cream</li>
      <li>I have tried a lot of the natural/organic lines, Jason&#x27;s, Mychelle, Aubrey, Desert Essence, Kiss my face, Derma-e, Burts, and more...</li>
      <li>Love this night cream.</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>i love all three.</li>
      <li>I love Acure.</li>
      <li>Love the smell and texture, however, I started itching on the areas where I put it</li>
      <li>My lips love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>and I fell in love with them</li>
      <li>What I really love is the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
      <li>I hope it continues to work for me as I love Acure.  </li>
      <li>but I love it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I decided to give this product a try.</li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>I think Boscia makes a MUCH better night cream than Acure, and I believe both are cruelty free.</li>
      <li>Smells fresh and earthy, but kind of citrus</li>
      <li>It hasn&#x27;t sucked away wrinkles or brown spots, or done anything magical like a Botox shot in a tube, but it does leave my skin soft instead of it being that charming, winter flaky.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I would say within the first couple weeks of using this product I was taken aback by how great my skin looked so much so that I found the confidence to venture out of my house without a stitch of makeup on.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy this night cream.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and is not greasy.  </li>
      <li>My skins absorbs this moisturizer very well and the cream smells amazingly invigorating.</li>
      <li>It has a strong, fresh lavender scent (and something cooler, minty?).</li>
      <li>and I really do wake up feeling like my face looks better than when I went to sleep.  </li>
      <li>I have a young face and pretty good skin</li>
      <li>If I ever decide to run a quick errand</li>
      <li>A real shame, because these products have such great reviews.</li>
      <li>What is even better is the new tube they are packaging the cream in.  </li>
      <li>My skin has improved tremendously and it makes me feel fresh.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t worry about it gunking up my pillow, and in the morning my skin is very soft and maybe even lighter with a more even skin tone.</li>
      <li>There products are lovely, I use this in conjunction with a red LED light</li>
      <li>Lots of people hesitate to buy 4 months worth of a product they&#x27;ve never used, let alone one you put on your face.</li>
      <li>The price is better then many other night creams</li>
      <li>Initially, the texture is nice, not greasy, but after it dries - or gets absorbed - I don&#x27;t like it very much.  </li>
      <li>It is organic, fair trade and does not contain parabens or other undesirable ingredients.  </li>
      <li>This absorbs right into my skin almost immediately.</li>
      <li>If you have dry skin, it&#x27;s not the most comfortable feeling.</li>
      <li>I have not been able to find face wash and moisturizer that does not dry my skin.  </li>
      <li>Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but this seems to be a good product for people with sensitive skin prone to dermatitis.</li>
      <li>But all of a sudden my complexion was clear, even and bright, something I didn&#x27;t think could be achieved.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and this moisturizer makes a huge difference in the tone and texture of my skin.</li>
      <li>As with the other products, the cream went on nicely and was quickly absorbed.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend as a more natural night cream.</li>
      <li>My skin feels really smooth and soft, no breakouts.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve been able to get away with using it only once a day</li>
      <li>This one did the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>It is very well priced too!  </li>
      <li>My wrinkles remained the same however, so if you are looking for magic eraser, this is not it.</li>
      <li>Works better than i thought will be purchasing accure products soon in the short time I&#x27;ve been using accure products I noticed the difference</li>
      <li>I first just bought the lemongrass body lotion and this night cream</li>
      <li>I love the Acure line, especially their shampoo and conditioner!</li>
      <li>It is rich, even though it is not heavy.</li>
      <li>I use that title because when I apply it (and this could be after the argan oil application), my skin feels VERY tight, and not in a good way.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend going to a store like Whole Foods first to sample these before you buy.</li>
      <li>Lightly scented, and not too thick or greasy, this coats my skin nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave me breaking out or waking up in the morning with that slimy, too much moisturizer glow.</li>
      <li>Thank you Acure Organics and my local natural grocer because you did something smart: provide free samples!</li>
      <li>really  like the Acure brand and its policies.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use it before I go to bed at night . I feel that it does a good job moisturizing without being greasy . The price is better then many other night creams</li>
    <li> I love the Acure cleanser and eye cream but this night cream is horrible. It goes on &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; and makes my skin feel caked instead of moisturized. I am not big on the day cream either as it makes my skin oily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this several months in combination with a stem-cell spf tinted moisturizer.  I also use the Acure stem cell eye cream.  I have a young face and pretty good skin but I am noticing several benefits.  1) My dry spots have disappeared.  I&#x27;ve had them every winter on my cheeks since my teens.  They showed up year-round in my 20s and since I started adding this to my routine they have not returned.  2) My skin no longer looks tired.  I had a baby, hit 30 and felt like my skin just changed.  Since I started using this, it&#x27;s amazing to me how vibrant my face has started to look, even on mornings where I haven&#x27;t had much sleep. 3)  My lips love this stuff.  I&#x27;ve noticed my lips seem slightly plumper when I apply this to my lips.  Since it absorbs quickly it&#x27;s a great lip base under chap stick to keep my lips feeling moisturized.  I&#x27;m a chap stick junkie but feel like this helps me feel like I need less chap stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was already using natural products before buying this.  I didn&#x27;t have any reaction to the change in product when applied to my face, however it took a couple weeks for my chest to acclimate.  A couple pimples popped up orginally but I don&#x27;t have that problem anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why, but this product makes me break out. I love the Acure line, especially their shampoo and conditioner! Maybe it&#x27;s too much oil for my skin to handle before bed? I&#x27;m not sure. But lately I have been using 2 drops of lavender oil and 2 drops of frankincense oil and I have seen a major improvement.</li>
    <li> Kind of pasty and leaves a weird residue on skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using expensive &amp;#34;department store&amp;#34; brands for way too long of a time.  This product applies beautifully, has a trace scent of &amp;#34;yummy&amp;#34; but not overpowering, and has ingredients that it can boast about and feel glad to print (no animal testing besides).  If you&#x27;re thinking you should try it, try it.  You will be glad you did.</li>
    <li> I found Acure through a friend&#x27;s recommendation.  I have not been able to find face wash and moisturizer that does not dry my skin.  Acure is the only formula that works for me (and it is less expensive than most brands).  I love that it is a US product and a green product.</li>
    <li> Still waiting to decide how I like this. So far so good! Smells fresh and earthy, but kind of citrus</li>
    <li> Thank you Acure Organics and my local natural grocer because you did something smart: provide free samples! Lots of people hesitate to buy 4 months worth of a product they&#x27;ve never used, let alone one you put on your face. The generous sample lasted 4 days - and I loved the product, so.. (sorry local grocer) I tracked it down here.  If you don&#x27;t like the smell of lavender, this product is not for you. It has a strong, fresh lavender scent (and something cooler, minty?). What I really love is the way it makes my skin feel. It&#x27;s a rich lotion, a little goes a long way, and my skin loves it. It&#x27;s not greasy. I don&#x27;t worry about it gunking up my pillow, and in the morning my skin is very soft and maybe even lighter with a more even skin tone. I&#x27;ve never found a night cream that works so well, with a scent that doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive nose or redness-prone skin.</li>
    <li> This cream makes my skin feel tight. Maybe that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s suppose to be, but it feels very drying to me. I prefer a creamier moisturizer. I have had it around a year. Perhaps it&#x27;s just drying out.</li>
    <li> I love Acure products and will continue to use them but not the Argan Stem Cell night cream as it went bad/rancid in a few months. I didn&#x27;t take it in my purse or out of the house.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully no one else has this experience with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this moisturiser at Whole Foods. They had told me that it was their best selling cream. The price was great also so I thought why not. I have sensitive skin and it did not irritate at all. It left my skin so soft in the morning. Great moisturiser and would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Acure Organics just rocks. There products are lovely, I use this in conjunction with a red LED light and I think I am keeping the wrinkles at bay!</li>
    <li> my favorite thing in the world! i also use the day cream and the cream cleanser. i love all three. I have weird skin and it works amazingly with it. I also had a frown line wrinkle caused by hypopigmentation of my skin which left a hyperpigmented scar and a wrinkle. and i must say my wrinkle is gone and my darker spots on my skin is slowly disappearing. amazing products!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this night cream.  It has a soothing fragrance, pleasing consistency and makes my skin feel great!</li>
    <li> This product feels too drying on the face. Is it supposed to form some type of tightening effect overnight? Because I don&#x27;t see why it has to feel so try and weird. Not to mention the itching on my face - it makes the left side of my face and under my neck itch. I clearly do not need this. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a week but I love it.  I have rosacea and it does not aggravate it. I wake up with soft clear skin.  I hope it continues to work for me as I love Acure.  I only recently stumbled upon this line at my local health food store.  I first just bought the lemongrass body lotion and this night cream and I fell in love with them and I went back today and bought almost everything Acure has.  I hope the rest of the products are just as good.</li>
    <li> Love this night cream. You can feel the difference in your skin the next day. The smell is delicious. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I have a combination skin and works perfectly!</li>
    <li> What I first noticed about this product was, the tube was half empty and the box appeared old and used. I was more concerned about performance, however. As with the other products, the cream went on nicely and was quickly absorbed. Once I realized I was breaking out in hives, I stopped using the Acure products and introduced them, one at a time, to see if maybe only one of them was causing the skin reaction. For sure, the eye cream has something in it that causes hives to break out all around my eye area. But then, this cream also caused little red marks to appear on my cheeks and neck. A real shame, because these products have such great reviews. I would recommend going to a store like Whole Foods first to sample these before you buy.</li>
    <li> This creme will dry your skin. If you have dry skin, it&#x27;s not the most comfortable feeling. I use it with conjunction Acure firming serum (AKA oil). It does a good job at moisturizing and tightening skin a bit, as well as evening out complexion. My wrinkles remained the same however, so if you are looking for magic eraser, this is not it.</li>
    <li> Health and Beauty)I was looking for a moisturizer to replace the Estee Lauder lotion that I was using which was discontinued recently. And I was surprised by how well this product compared to my former moisturizer. This cream is great! It is thicker than I had expected but the product is accurately described by the seller - it is a cream. Although it much more dense than the oil control hydrator I used to use, it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy at all. My face feels healthy and nourished with each use and for a 1/3 of the cost too! My skins absorbs this moisturizer very well and the cream smells amazingly invigorating.I was very skeptical of the this product because it seems that there weren&#x27;t many amazon buyers submitting reviews. But I knew I had to try something fast because I was running out of product. I&#x27;m glad I decided to give this product a try. It arrived so quickly in the mail that I didn&#x27;t even run out of my previous moisturizer.In the past I have found that \\&quot;oil control\\&quot; usually meant alcohol was a major ingredient. But alcohol is so drying for my skin that it would leave my face red and irritated. Not this stuff. It doesnt contain alcohol and seems to be completely natural. I was so impressed by this cream that I didn&#x27;t even bother to finish what was left over in my Estee Lauder bottle. Instructions say use it at least twice a day but I&#x27;ve been able to get away with using it only once a day</li>
    <li> I love the feel and smell of this product, but it did not agree with my skin at all! Each time I applied it to my face, my skin turned red and felt very sensitive.  Over time, my skin started to break out with very deep, sore acne, which isn&#x27;t usually a problem for me.  I took a break from the cream and tried again a few weeks later with the same result.  This product may be natural, but the essential oils are very harsh.  I would not recommend for sensitive skin, at all...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive for how little you receive. It&#x27;s a bit too thick for me, but I&#x27;ve enjoyed it. I haven&#x27;t seen any positive effects from it, other than moisture without toxic chemicals.</li>
    <li> Love this night cream &amp; it has no harmful ingredients. Have used it for months &amp; plan to continue. Just the right consistently and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Works better than i thought will be purchasing accure products soon in the short time I&#x27;ve been using accure products I noticed the difference</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is amazing!! It is erasing the lines in my face and evening out my skin tone. Friends say I look like I&#x27;m in my twenties after using this cream. They want to know what my secret is...and I tell them....Acure night cream!!! Not to mention some of Acure&#x27;s profits go to help underpriveleged women.</li>
    <li> I have seborrheic dermatitis, and it feels like it&#x27;s a full time job trying to keep my facial skin clear.  My skin now overreacts to everything I eat (I have to avoid added sugar, processed foods, and refined grains or my skin will break out) and to everything I put on it.  Even gently washing my face with a hypoallergenic product can cause my skin to flare up and redden for a few hours afterwards.  I had a sample of this Acure Night Cream product for awhile and finally decided to use it, crossing my fingers that my skin wouldn&#x27;t flare up and redden after I put it on.  My skin loved it!  It actually seemed to clear up my skin (even though it&#x27;s basically clear now, I always seem to have some redness on my chin area and the sides of my nose) and to help give it a bit of a glow.  Serendipitously, this product is on sale at my local natural health food store (and my housemate works there and lets me use his discount!), so I recently purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brother once chided me for spending too much money on natural skin care products and said that his friend who&#x27;s a doctor claims that the more expensive natural products aren&#x27;t any better than what you can buy at a drugstore.  Au contraire!  For starters, his friend is a cardiologist, not a dermatologist, and while he knows far more about diagnosing and treating heart disease than I ever will, he could not be more wrong about his evaluation of skin care products.  They are not all created equally, and my skin will react very poorly to a mineral oil-based synthetic skin cream, and even natural ingredients-based creams can set my skin off.  Furthermore, my brother luckily has been spared seborrheic dermatitis (he just has the occasional dandruff flare-ups), so his skin is less reactive and sensitive than mine, so drugstore skin creams are probably all that he needs.  My doctor says that seborrheic dermatitis is like having dandruff on your face.  Not a fun condition, but I&#x27;m glad that I found a skin cream that will actually soothe and possibly help clear my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised by the range of responses to this product, from glowing five stars to warning 1-star reviews.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but this seems to be a good product for people with sensitive skin prone to dermatitis.ctually soothe and possibly help clear my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised by the range of responses to this product, from glowing five stars to warning 1-star reviews.

    <li> This Argan stem cell night cream makes a difference every night I use it.  In the morning, I see my facial tone looking very even, with improvement in any blemishes that existed the day before.  My facial skin looks smoother and softer than when I don&#x27;t use the night cream, and there is a radiance that results as well.</li>
    <li> I have  dry skin (I&#x27;m 40 years old, for reference). My skin is often prone to dry flaky patches. If you&#x27;ve suffered dry patches, you know how hard it is to find a moisturizer that works to eliminate (and not exacerbate) the problem. I used this for two nights and two days and have noticed that the patches are about 80% gone. My skin feels really smooth and soft, no breakouts. However, is fragranced, so if you are sensitive to fragrance, this might cause a reaction. It comes in a glass bottle pump jar and I find that 1 and a half pumps works perfectly on my entire face. It is rich, even though it is not heavy. Probably would not recommend for oily skin. I wish it came in a larger size. Expensive, but very soothing natural lavender scent (I look forward to putting this on!) and very effective. Where has this moisturizer been all my life? Also, I ordered this from Vitacost. They shipped the same day I ordered and everything was packed really well (non-eco packing materials, though).</li>
    <li> I use that title because when I apply it (and this could be after the argan oil application), my skin feels VERY tight, and not in a good way.  Initially, the texture is nice, not greasy, but after it dries - or gets absorbed - I don&#x27;t like it very much.  I have dry skin to start with, so this doesn&#x27;t help at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly can&#x27;t say this is all that great.  I think Boscia makes a MUCH better night cream than Acure, and I believe both are cruelty free.</li>
    <li> Great product.. Leaves my skin feeling soft and supple. Not greasy at all, which is my most common complaint with moisturizers. This absorbs right into my skin almost immediately. I&#x27;m a huge fan of Acure products!!</li>
    <li> I love this. For years I&#x27;d used Neutrogena and it worked well enough, but I am unhappy with some of their practices and decided to try something else. Lightly scented, and not too thick or greasy, this coats my skin nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave me breaking out or waking up in the morning with that slimy, too much moisturizer glow. It hasn&#x27;t sucked away wrinkles or brown spots, or done anything magical like a Botox shot in a tube, but it does leave my skin soft instead of it being that charming, winter flaky.</li>
    <li> I used this cream during my pregnancy since it was highly rated by Skin Deep.  I really liked it!  It was moisturizing without clogging my pores and I felt it helped to reduce my wrinkles.  It goes on smoothly and is not greasy.  It is very well priced too!  I highly recommend as a more natural night cream.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product line for about a year and I am very happy. It is organic, fair trade and does not contain parabens or other undesirable ingredients.  It is just the product line I have been looking for, works great and a great price. I have tried a lot of the natural/organic lines, Jason&#x27;s, Mychelle, Aubrey, Desert Essence, Kiss my face, Derma-e, Burts, and more...but this is by far the best line I have used.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Acure night cream at my local grocery store because I was having some skin issues that my previous night cream and skin care regimen wasn&#x27;t taking care of (a rough, dry spot that wouldn&#x27;t go away). After my first use I noticed an immediate difference in my skin, including the rough patch and then went directly to Acure&#x27;s official website and ordered their Day Cream, Face Wash Gel and the Cleansing Shampoo &amp; Conditioner. I was that impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say within the first couple weeks of using this product I was taken aback by how great my skin looked so much so that I found the confidence to venture out of my house without a stitch of makeup on. I have combination skin (oily t-zone, normal everywhere else) with a pink/reddish complexion and a mix of freckles and a bit of sun damage from growing up in the South. If I ever decide to run a quick errand it&#x27;s always a dusting of powder foundation to even out my tone and mascara, that is the minimum amount of makeup I have to wear when going out. But all of a sudden my complexion was clear, even and bright, something I didn&#x27;t think could be achieved. For me to go out without anything on my face is really saying something about this product line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately my amazing results did not last and now my complexion is back to where it was even though I am still using the Acure line exactly the same since getting those initial results. I think I will be trying other products that Acure makes to see if I can find something that can achieve the results I previously got because I&#x27;m pretty disappointed that what Acure did for me was so short-lived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really  like the Acure brand and its policies. I was also pretty surprised that everything lasted as long as it did considering the small bottles. I ordered all my face products in early December 2013 and I still have some left. 4 Stars because of the product and brand but had to take one away for the short-lived results.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this moisturizer makes a huge difference in the tone and texture of my skin. It improves the overall appearance of my blemishes and gives me that dewy look without heavy oils or harsh ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Also smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I read about this line in an article and thought I would try it. I absolutely love it. My skin has improved tremendously and it makes me feel fresh. This product does not make you greasy or sticky.</li>
    <li> I love this night cream and I really do wake up feeling like my face looks better than when I went to sleep.  I have sensitive skin and I have no problems with this at all.  What is even better is the new tube they are packaging the cream in.  It makes it so much easier to get the last drops of cream out (as opposed to the former glass container &amp; pump they were using).  I am a product junkie and will occasionally stray, thinking I can find something else I like better.  Without fail, I keep coming back to Acure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent thousands on products that don&#x27;t work.  This one did the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;My neck wrinkles disappeared.  I am so happy I am going to order a case!</li>
    <li> This feels good and smells good.  It has not made me break out, which is unusual for creams, especially night creams.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and texture, however, I started itching on the areas where I put it and after I stopped using it, the itching went away.  Would have loved it to work for me.</li>
    <li> I love Acure. I use their day cream and eye cream every day. For some reason this night cream always makes me break out.</li>
    <li> This is hydrating but, I prefer evanhealy.</li>
    <li> The best. Ever. I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and I live in the desert. Did I say this is the best?</li>
    <li> I had high expectations for this product, as I love other Acure products...especially the fragrence-free face wipes. Terribly disappointed when I opened it the first time...I couldn&#x27;t believe the strong lavender smell! I tried some on the back of my hands to see if the smell quickly dissipates (it doesn&#x27;t).  For a product I put on my face...so close to my eyes?  Really?  I&#x27;m going to have to return.  I don&#x27;t understand this love affair with lavender.</li>
    <li> This evening cream smells strongly of lavender, which I like, but it&#x27;s not rich and creamy.  It left my skin feeling taught and tight.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
