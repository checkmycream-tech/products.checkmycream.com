    <li> My great-grandson LOVES dinosaurs so he should enjoy these!</li>
    <li> Fun stickers the kids loved them at the dinosaur party.</li>
    <li> The tattoos worked fine.  Lots of fun for a rainy day.  Put one on each hand, and let the 2 dinosaurs have a battle.  Rrrhh!</li>
    <li> My son loves dinosaurs. I bought these for him and they are perfect and very bright in color. I would get them again.</li>
    <li> I got these for my two sons, who love dinosaurs.  They are good quality temporary tattoos. Like all temporary tattoos, they last about a day or two.  The initial quality is good, nice detail and bright color.  We use them for fun and remove them once they start to peel.  Overall, great fun for kids that love dinos!</li>
    <li> This was for my son&#x27;s party favor bag at his 3rd birthday party so i was looking specifically for dinosaur themed items and this fit the bill. My son loved it so thank you!</li>
    <li> Tattoos lasted for a very long time. Purchased a set for my 2 year old son&#x27;s birthday party, the kids as well as the adults had fun with these tattoos. They lasted long as well. Would certainly recommend.</li>
    <li> They were a lot of fun for the kids.  They went on easily and had nice detail.  They stood up to some light hand washing, but came off in the bath.  It was a big hit at the birthday party.</li>
    <li> Kids loved these tattoos we added these to their goodie bags.. Differnt Dino&#x27;s, bright colors! Great PRICE You cant go wrong :)</li>
    <li> Great, shipped fast and worked well</li>
    <li> They are ok.  They seem a little old, but for an 8 year old dinosaur fan, they&#x27;ll do.</li>
    <li> Lots and lots of tattoos.  The kids loved them, I am just not sure what to do with all the extras?  They work well though</li>
    <li> I bought these tattoos for my 4 year olds Dino Birthday Party.  I received 24 of a T-Rex and 12 of a Stegasaurus.  I expected more options for one.  Secondly I think it&#x27;s ridiculous to not even get an equal amount of the two they sent.  I wanted to use the left over tattoos for my kids for fun for after the party, but they aren&#x27;t going to want the same tattoo every time!</li>
    <li> The tattoos are great looking and shipping was next day which is always appreciated when you do the free shipping!</li>
    <li> The assortment of the tattoos wasn&#x27;t great.  It came with a lot of some types of dinosaurs and only a couple of the other types.  I was disappointed in that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. They arrived quickly, sooner than promised. I  have these set aside for a stocking stuffer so I can&#x27;t say at this time how well they work.</li>
    <li> Perfect for party favors</li>
    <li> These were great quality tattoos and lasted while.  Perfect party favors for my son&#x27;s dino themed b&#x27;day party!</li>
    <li> We gave these tattoos out in the goody bag at a birthday party.  They are very colorful and fun for the kids.  Good value.</li>
    <li> Really cute and perfect for goodie bags.</li>
    <li> These tattoos look cool but they don&#x27;t work, we have tried several methods only for my toddler to be completely disappointed. Woudnt purchase...don&#x27;t bother..waste</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daycare kids-they didn&#x27;t stay on well at all.  I could see as soon as they were applied that they were not the quality I was used to finding in temporary tattoos.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my purchase from this co mpany. Thank you</li>
    <li> the tattos came in very fast 2 days after i ordered them, which was awsome, and so much faster then i expected!!! my 3 year old loves them as well, &amp; thats always a plus!! I would definently reccomend this item to a friend :)</li>
    <li> Weren&#x27;t quite what I expected. Tattoos are very small . and almost look more like sticker sheets ! They are being used as a gift in a goody bag for my son&#x27;s birthday party. They&#x27;ll do for that I suppose. But they aren&#x27;t &amp;#34; cute tattoo&#x27;s &amp;#34; as said in the discreption .</li>
    <li> Kids love these things.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Or whatever else. There is a large variety and they are individually packaged so perfect to parties and such. Good quality and easy to apply</li>
    <li> Very disappointed! Only received 2 types of dinosaurs (brontosaurus and pterodactyl)! The picture shows 6 different dinosaurs. The tattoos sent are not the ones in the pictures.We now have 36 tattoos of two dinosaurs and 3 kids....can&#x27;t really divide them up evenly. Little bit of false advertising going on.</li>
    <li> Do not expect to get what you see.  Only 3 different dinosaurs in the shipment.  Very upset by the lack of variety, so unless you are buying for a party, stay away!</li>
    <li> The tattoos arrived promptly. However, in the bubble shipping envelope there were over 40 loose tattoos with no packaging. Two were brontosaurus, the rest were triceratops and pterodactyl (over 20 each). Of course my 3 kids all liked the brontosaurus best. The tats look nothing like the photo, and last about a day, which could be a plus or minus I suppose. Overall impression is that these seem like leftover party favors from a kids birthday party...kinda shady.</li>
    <li> My late posting has nothing to do with the quality of this shipment.  It shipped immediately.  And my two little great grand sons loved them.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely order again and certainly recomment to my friends.</li>
    <li> My son loves these tattoos. They only last a couple days, which is great for us. And you get a lot for a great price, as well as nice quality pictures.</li>
    <li> Great gift for a little boy or girl that loves dinosaurs! Almost all children love the little tatoos and there were A lot of them!</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t work well even when pressing the tat on skin for b longer than usual. Once peeled it comes right off or comes off immediately after aoplying. Waste of my money :(</li>
    <li> my oldest grandson loves dinosaurs and these were a great hit with him. He will enjoy them for a while.</li>
    <li> he loved theam so much i was a huge hit for his bday all the kids loved theam and put theam on right away i had 24 kids in his party i got 2 packs and everyone thought it was great</li>
    <li> Lots of color--stick well and stay on.</li>
    <li> I got these tattoos for my 3-year-old for Christmas (he was 2 1/2 at the time) and he went completely nuts over them. The colors are great, they are nicely detailed, and really cute yet realistic. I&#x27;ve gotten him temporary tattoos before, but they always seem to last about a day, which is not very fun. These tattoos actually last for days, and they don&#x27;t smear and peel if you rub them. My son picked a couple for his arms 4 or 5 days ago, and they are just now starting to fade. They survived 2 or 3 baths, long sleeves, lotion, etc. They also only take about 15-20 seconds to transfer onto skin with a wet paper towel, which is not long at all. My only warning would be that these should be kept in a ziplock bag in a drawer somewhere, because if they get humid or warm they won&#x27;t peel off right, but I think that goes for all tattoos. My son loves them, and I do too!</li>
    <li> Cute. Perfect for bday party bags.</li>
    <li> they were individually wrapped and had about 6 diff types of dinosaurs!! used them in the goodie bags for my nephews 1st birthday!! they were perfect and the kids loved them!</li>
    <li> I added these to favor bags and all the kids loved them.  They last a while and come off pretty easily with baby oil.</li>
    <li> These are great as kids&#x27; tattoos go. They are colorful and realistic, and lasted much longer then the others we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Nothing special here. I would say they are mid-grade tattoos. They stay on for a couple days, but start to wear off after a bath or two. I&#x27;ve seen better and worse tattoos.</li>
    <li> Cute tattoos but did not last very long.  Good for switching them out often.  Nice variety of dinosaurs and enough of them.</li>
    <li> Good variety, huge number, and quality seems good after a month. Bought for boys 3+5 and they both enjoy very much.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my daughter&#x27;s 6th birthday party and they were a big hit. Good variety and they lasted for at least two days.</li>
    <li> Product as described. I would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Just as expected, plus I like that they don&#x27;t stay on for a whole month. 3 days and they are gone</li>
    <li> These dino tattoos are fantastic, especially for dino themed parties.  They go on easily and apply well without tearing.  They also come off without much trouble.  Stays put until you use soap and water.  Does of course require some rubbing to get it off.</li>
    <li> These dinosaur tattoos are nice for kids, but  tended to fade after about 24 hours through normal wear and bathing. I&#x27;ve seen other tattoos last several days. At this price we just reapply a new one.</li>
    <li> These are perfect and such good quality and I love that they were already individual.  I also loved the price (of product AND free shipping!)  I used them for his party and had enough for handouts to his class.  I would totally recommend these to others with dino lovers.  I plan on checking to see if there&#x27;s other kinds they make that I can grab for my other 3 kids birthday parties.</li>
    <li> kids loved these. great party favor</li>
    <li> Disappointed in how fast they fade. My son loved them. But they only have colour for about 30 minutes. Will try never to buy items that originate with the Oriental Trading company again.</li>
    <li> Great idea and fun but they didn&#x27;t transfer very well on the kids. They were cheap and looked fun, just didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
    <li> The tattoos were great I put them in a dinosaur party bag for the kids, they loved them. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a great party favor and activity. We used them for our daughter&#x27;s 5 year birthday and they were a hit. Great colors, easy to apply.</li>
    <li> What kid doesn&#x27;t like dinosaurs, and temporary tattoo&#x27;s are the best, don&#x27;t have to worry about ink poisoning, and all the risks,, i even had one on my ankle....my son said now i&#x27;m cool !!</li>
    <li> alot of tattoos for kids to play with, Packaged wonderful. The only thing is they don&#x27;t stick to the skin. Grandson was disappointed,</li>
    <li> Received these in a timely fashion and in good shape. Full color and have all the safety warnings they should have. From the outside of the package there are 6 different patterns. Don&#x27;t know how many of each as I plan to give the set as a gift.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to review these after I used them on my kids. These tattoos are so nice! The colors are bright and beautiful and they go on the easiest &amp; cleanest I&#x27;ve had in my experience. I didn&#x27;t expect this high of quality and I am so pleased!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my 5 year old dinosaur loving son&#x27;s birthday. He loves them!</li>

    <li> Put these in my son&#x27;s goody bags for his dinosaur birthday party!  They were really cute and I liked how they were individually wrapped instead of sheets.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my sons stocking thinking he would get a variety of different dinosaur tattoos. Instead there were only 3 different kinds. Good tattoos and a lot of them...just wish there was more of a variety</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s 4th birthday party was dinosaur themed, and these were absolutely perfect. He loved them, which is good since I forgot to actually put them in the goodie bags. More for him, which he will definitely be happy about. They were very cheap, well worth the price.</li>

    <li> The tattoos were cute... not as big of a hit as we had hoped. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed though, they were cool</li>
    <li> They came already cut apart and with clear plastic protectors.  Good colors and easy to put on.  Kids loved them.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my son&#x27;s birthday party. He loved them; he tried one and it lasted a week. Great for little boys that love dinosaurs.</li>
    <li> great product I love how they were already cut individually no tearing or scissors needed  .. shipping was very slow allow  a little extra time but the tattoos&#x27; were a big hit</li>
    <li> I received all 6 types of dinos but only about half actually worked as temporary tattoos. I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Bought these as party favors for my granddaughter upcoming birthday party. Have to say she talked me into giving her a couple early and she loves them. She&#x27;ll be 3 soon and really loves dinosaurs.</li>
    <li> We bought these as gifts or party favors!! All the kids enjoyed, with plenty left over for rewards later and at a very good price!!</li>
    <li> Arrived almost a week earlier than expected and had all 6 varieties. They are much cooler looking in person, too. The little boy that I bought these for is going to love them!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my 3 year old son. They went on easy and stayed on a long time. He loves them.</li>
    <li> These are cute and as described</li>
    <li> This was a gift so I&#x27;m not sure yet whether the child liked it or not but he does love dinosaurs</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re very cute but they don&#x27;t all stick on.</li>
