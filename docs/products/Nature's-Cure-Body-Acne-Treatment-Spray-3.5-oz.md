      <li>Also, the smell is nice.  </li>
      <li>The product is also very light</li>
      <li>The cream is better.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Botle shuld be biiger  ( 8 onz or more )</li>
      <li>For the price, there are much better options.  </li>
      <li>I switched to another product and it seems to work much better.</li>
      <li>:) I had tried exfoliating and anti-acne body washes, but this healed it up within a week or two.</li>
      <li>I have 2 bottles and will continue to use until they are finished,as this was the most recommended product on the web.</li>
      <li>I have also ordered liquids from many vendors on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I just got used to it, thinking that as a guy it&#x27;s OK.</li>
      <li>It seems to get the job done for the most part; didn&#x27;t notice any huge improvements while using it but didn&#x27;t get any additional breakouts or anything.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have that unbearable smell and when you chew it, the taste is very mild.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use spray bottle.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, non-sticky, non-staining spray.  </li>
      <li>Although I have a very mild case of body acne</li>
      <li>I ordered this product through Drugstore.com and it was package fine.  </li>
      <li>Please note that if you currently have body acne you must first treat the  ones you allreday have with Benzoil peroxide ( zapzit  works great!!)</li>
      <li>but I already see a huge improvement.  </li>
      <li>I am so happy with this product, it took a total of three days to work for me.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and clean up.</li>
      <li>If it doesn&#x27;t then clean the hole.</li>
      <li>I bought this after seeing so many positive reviews.</li>
      <li>I use it on my body and even on my face and everything has cleared right up!  </li>
      <li>It works fast since the very first time I used it I loved it and it is also very affordable.</li>
      <li>it works quickly.</li>
      <li>apply after shower and it dries fairly quickly</li>
      <li>Wish I&#x27;d found this sooner - I was using a similar body spray with a lower percentage of salicylic acid, and this works much better!  </li>
      <li>defiantly worth trying.</li>
      <li>The sprayer is great, I have bought body acne spray bottles that do not spray well, and this one does, but I have not noticed that this spray has helped clear anything up on my back.</li>
      <li>and i like to use it right out of the shower.</li>
      <li>Works great, especially for body  acne on back.</li>
      <li>delivery was very fast</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m already needing to order another bottle since the first one I ordered is running out.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s never failed me.</li>
      <li>First of all, the pump on the spray works just as the product is described.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I have ordered the spray.</li>
      <li>I have had acne on my back for so many years and it looked horible.</li>
      <li>I also use a salicylic body wash (Neutrogena) in the shower being sure that it&#x27;s the last thing I use</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told one of my friends about it that avidly uses proactiv, and she said that when she tried to buy Nature&#x27;s Cure on here that it was sold out.  </li>
      <li>so you get a good even spray and don&#x27;t waste product trying to spray in five directions while reaching over a shoulder.</li>
      <li>However, the first two days I really didn&#x27;t notice any changes with my skin.  </li>
      <li>the acne it pretty much gone.</li>
      <li>Proactive never worked for me when I started getting acne on my back after getting off the pill, but this stuff worked very quickly and made it</li>
      <li>The pump has a large range</li>
      <li>It is \\&quot;obviously\\&quot; wise to allow your back to dry before putting clothing on it.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend if you want to get rid of body acne fast!</li>
      <li>After using whole bottle, I can see them dissapearing a bit.</li>
      <li>This product is working well at  maintaining my back acne free.</li>
      <li>I hope to see a difference before summer really sets in</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t get too much in one spot.</li>
      <li>Even when you don&#x27;t see much acne, keep applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Something that had been really embarrassing is now history.</li>
      <li>and you really can&#x27;t smell an odor.  </li>
      <li>I was glad to find it here for only a few dollars more than the store sold it for.</li>
      <li>I just wanted to let everyone know that this stuff really is all the hype that they make it out to be.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad to say that my back is perfectly clear.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, and my skin is clearer than it&#x27;s been in a long time.</li>
      <li>Plus, left my face feeling really clean afterwards.</li>
      <li>Maybe that was because it was a 10% solution, or the particular brand.</li>
      <li>After years and years of having acne on my back - this had significantly helped clear it up!</li>
      <li>For the first time since middle school I actually feel comfortable not wearing a pound of concealer/foundation.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t have someone, try to get far away from your skin and spray a large area</li>
      <li>(I also wash my chest and back with my face wash in the shower) and within a few weeks most of my body acne is pretty much gone.</li>
      <li>or else it will come right back.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After a break-up, a new girlfriend commented on the acne and said I should treat it with salicylic acid.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really use the lotion that much that comes with the pills, except for on my back.  </li>
      <li>I like that this spray is fast drying and it does really work to keep back acne at bay.</li>
      <li>I was very disappointed after seeing that it had gotten so many good reviews, but maybe it just isn&#x27;t right for my skin type.</li>
      <li>My son has acne on his back and it is clearing it up fast!</li>
      <li>I first tried benzoyl peroxide, but it made my skin turn red.</li>
      <li>It was recommended to me by a dermatologist and it&#x27;s really helped clear up bumps on my back and chest caused from sweat and moisture wicking fabrics.  </li>
      <li>Works great on backacne but bottle doesnt last, so it can get expensive to be re-ordering ever 2 weeks</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for almost two months and it has done nothing to clear my body acne.</li>
      <li>I have tried proactiv, and haven&#x27;t had nearly the results that</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It seems to get the job done for the most part; didn&#x27;t notice any huge improvements while using it but didn&#x27;t get any additional breakouts or anything.  Either way, the bottle was way too small (I thought) and the product once applied, way too sticky.  I&#x27;ll pass.</li>
    <li> I bought this after seeing so many positive reviews. I am so frustrated that after 3 weeks of use on my upper back, didn&#x27;t see any improvement at all.</li>
    <li> I have had acne on my back for so many years and it looked horible. I&#x27;ve been using this bottle for only about a month now and the acne on my back has almost been gone! The reason why I gave it 4 stars was because it can&#x27;t be used upside down and that it smells a bit.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Nature&#x27;s cure spray, along with the pills and the lotion.  I started using their products about a week ago, and have seen some serious results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People are already asking me what I am using for my face, and it is completley clearing up like crazy!  I am recommending it to all of my friends, and I plan on using this for a long time.  I don&#x27;t really use the lotion that much that comes with the pills, except for on my back.  A combination of the lotion and spray on my back is what is really helping out a lot I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray hasn&#x27;t had any problems spraying from different angles, and at has a slight \\&quot;clean\\&quot; scent to it.  I don&#x27;t know if it works for the long term, but I know my face/back/chest are clearer than they ever have been, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told one of my friends about it that avidly uses proactiv, and she said that when she tried to buy Nature&#x27;s Cure on here that it was sold out.  I will be checking into that, as I def. plan on buying more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And no, I&#x27;m not one of those paid people-I just wanted to let everyone know that this stuff really is all the hype that they make it out to be.  I have tried proactiv, and haven&#x27;t had nearly the results that this stuff has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 22 and still get acne like I&#x27;m a teenager-but I already see a huge improvement.  I wish I would have taken before/after pictures so everyone else can see too.  For the first time since middle school I actually feel comfortable not wearing a pound of concealer/foundation.</li>
    <li> Had stubborn back acne that seemed to not clear up with any product.  Spraying this body spray on my back a couple times a day finally seemed to do the trick!  I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> My son has acne on his back and it is clearing it up fast! I am very pleased. defiantly worth trying.</li>
    <li> It works when all bottle has been used. I did not feel dryness like some reviewers said. After having a baby I got all my back acned. Now, they are almost gone. Also, it made my skin soft. I reordered another bottle today. However, I gave 4 because when there is quarter of the bottle left, the spray stopped worked under any angle. So, I spray on my palms and apply on the back. It is not comfortable to do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost two months and it has done nothing to clear my body acne. I was very disappointed after seeing that it had gotten so many good reviews, but maybe it just isn&#x27;t right for my skin type. I had pretty severe acne all over my back, chest, and a little on my shoulders but this spray hasn&#x27;t made any difference. Also, it leaves a slight stickiness after applying and is difficult to spray upside down.</li>
    <li> After years and years of having acne on my back - this had significantly helped clear it up!</li>
    <li> When I received the bottle, the cap was broken so the bottle was half full by the time I received it.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this product, it took a total of three days to work for me. Although I have a very mild case of body acne I am still very happy about the results.  I sprayed it one once daily after a shower and I had No body acne for the duration of its use.  Two weeks after running out my acne started to come back.  I will continue to use this product, and I am very glad I took the chance to buy it.  The only thing I can complain about is the small amount that comes in the bottle.</li>
    <li> I was extremely disappointed when Avon stopped selling their Bacne spray.  That stuff seemed to work miracles! But since they did stop selling it, I had to try to find something that worked just as well.  I didn&#x27;t want to shell out major money for something if there was a cheaper alternative so I decided to try this.  It has a slight smell to it and gets a little sticky, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me since I put it on before going to bed and shower the smell off in the morning. So far, I can&#x27;t see that it has made any major difference, but I&#x27;m still trying it out.  I hope to see a difference before summer really sets in and I want to wear tank tops.</li>
    <li> Dries out body acne in a matter of days! I loved this product! It runs out in about a month, so it lasts quite a while! Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the best working stuff out there! Proactive never worked for me when I started getting acne on my back after getting off the pill, but this stuff worked very quickly and made it so I never got bacne again! you can even spray it while it&#x27;s facing upside down, which is a huge plus in harder to reach areas.</li>
    <li> Easy to use spray bottle. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and don&#x27;t see any improvement. My back is still breaking out.</li>
    <li> Product works great.  Cleared my skin, but you have to use it 2-3 times daily.</li>
    <li> Upon receipt, product was half empty.  Cap was loose.  It spilled all over the interior of box.  That same day, I requested to return product.  I had all the intentions to buy a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Return request DENIED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unacceptable way to treat a customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY FROM AMERICAN RX.</li>
    <li> This product is working well at  maintaining my back acne free. Please note that if you currently have body acne you must first treat the  ones you allreday have with Benzoil peroxide ( zapzit  works great!!) and  wash your  back and or body with  a salicilic acid  soap (I  used Neutrogena) Use the body spray twice daily  along with these  other two items and you ll have guaranteed results. After you have cleared up  continue to use  the spray to prevent  breakouts. I suggest to let the spray air dry before puttin on clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did  not rate it as a  4 beacause of the following:&lt;br /&gt;Spray cap does not really spray upside down.&lt;br /&gt;Bottle is  too hard to self handle for back acne&lt;br /&gt;Botle shuld be biiger  ( 8 onz or more ) Keeps running out every week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless I recomend this product . Good price and good results.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work For  me :-(</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It&#x27;s so good at keeping zits at bay!  I use it on my body and even on my face and everything has cleared right up!  I didn&#x27;t have sever acne but just regular zits here and there and now they are all gone!!  Please bring this product back!</li>
    <li> My teenagers have had great results with Nature&#x27;s Cure Acne Treatment products. This is the first time I have ordered the spray. My daughter loves it. She has acne on her back, chest and upper arms. The biggest problem she faced was that she had to have help to apply any treatment to her back. The spray solves that and she said it is faster and easier to apply to her chest and arms as well. Great product and now more convenient to use. Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Just received this product in the mail. Like many other people, I am also skeptical to try something new and waste money on it.  However, the first two days I really didn&#x27;t notice any changes with my skin.  Around the third day, I noticed that my skin was looking a lot smoother than it normall does.  I am on day for of the pill and the lotion that comes with it.  First of all, the pump on the spray works just as the product is described.  The product is also very light and you really can&#x27;t smell an odor.  The pump has a large range so you don&#x27;t have to over spray your back to get to those hard to reach area.  I normally spray my back four different times and that covers my back.  It is \\&quot;obviously\\&quot; wise to allow your back to dry before putting clothing on it.  The dry time for me had been less than a minute or so.  The pill works great as well.  It doesn&#x27;t have that unbearable smell and when you chew it, the taste is very mild.  I would recomment the product and I will also continue to use it.  It sounds like a lot but if you add the pill to your daily vitamin intake, it makes ie easier to take one during breakfast and the other pill after Dinner.  I ordered this product through Drugstore.com and it was package fine.  I have also ordered liquids from many vendors on Amazon.  It&#x27;s normally a few out of thousands that gets damaged.  However, this does not take away from the effectiveness of the product!</li>
    <li> I like that this spray is fast drying and it does really work to keep back acne at bay. I wish the bottle was a little bigger I&#x27;m already needing to order another bottle since the first one I ordered is running out. The smell is pleasant and it doesn&#x27;t leave a funky residue on your skin. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> great product that works well</li>
    <li> A friend suggested this product to my daughter who has white heads on her back.  This product worked great at clearing up the problem.  She is on her second bottle to keep the problem at bay!</li>
    <li> Purchased this to get rid of a few pimples on my chest. I saw results in two days. I highly recommend if you want to get rid of body acne fast!</li>
    <li> Wish I&#x27;d found this sooner - I was using a similar body spray with a lower percentage of salicylic acid, and this works much better!  It was recommended to me by a dermatologist and it&#x27;s really helped clear up bumps on my back and chest caused from sweat and moisture wicking fabrics.  Buying my second bottle now.</li>
    <li> I live in a very hot/humid climate and go to the gym regularly, and without treatment, my upper back will really break out. Hormones don&#x27;t help either, I suppose. I also use a salicylic body wash (Neutrogena) in the shower being sure that it&#x27;s the last thing I use (after I rinse my conditioner fully), then after I towel off, I spray this in the affected area and just let it dry. I&#x27;m glad to say that my back is perfectly clear. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years - also used to use Avon&#x27;s Mark Bacne Spray before it was discontinued - but this is a great substitute. Will keep buying it as long as they keep making it!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Get the Murad spray</li>
    <li> Story short: this stuff works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sprayed it on every other night for around two weeks (or some frequency like that) and my body acne was reduced to less than half of its former glory. Kept using it for a month the acne it pretty much gone. Awesome. Something that had been really embarrassing is now history. Money well spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acne will come back though, so you have to keep using it. Even when you don&#x27;t see much acne, keep applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had acne on my back and chest for years. I just got used to it, thinking that as a guy it&#x27;s OK. Every once in awhile I&#x27;d look in the mirror and notice how disgusting the acne was, but mostly I didn&#x27;t think about it. I didn&#x27;t know there was anything I could do, and my long-term girlfriend never said anything about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a break-up, a new girlfriend commented on the acne and said I should treat it with salicylic acid. I first tried benzoyl peroxide, but it made my skin turn red. Maybe that was because it was a 10% solution, or the particular brand. Regardless, I got this Natures Cure product and within a month the problem was solved. Case closed!</li>
    <li> It is not very effective. The cream is better. It was a waist of money. But Nature&#x27;s cure pills are good</li>
    <li> Did not work. Had to stopped after two weeks since there was no visible effects.</li>
    <li> I have some acnes on my back, and I apply it after showers. After using whole bottle, I can see them dissapearing a bit. So far no complains.</li>
    <li> I used to buy this stuff at my local rite aid, but they stopped selling it. I was glad to find it here for only a few dollars more than the store sold it for. I spray this product on my chest and back twice a day (I also wash my chest and back with my face wash in the shower) and within a few weeks most of my body acne is pretty much gone. The thing is, if you want the acne to stay gone you have to keep using it AT LEAST once a day, or else it will come right back. I know everyone has different skin, but at least for me, this product is a god send. I&#x27;ve been using it since I was 12 and I&#x27;m 18 now. It&#x27;s never failed me.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for a few years. Works great, especially for body  acne on back. Easy to spray on and is very effective. Anyone who   gives this product less than 5 stars, does not know what they are   talking about.</li>
    <li> Helped heal bumps all over my body. :) I had tried exfoliating and anti-acne body washes, but this healed it up within a week or two. Amazing stuff! And stronger than the neutrogena version of the body spray.</li>
    <li> Too expensive for the size.</li>
    <li> WORK LIKE WATER SPLASH, DO NOTHING</li>
    <li> yay! it didn&#x27;t cure my acne but it did help (with regular use). it does work upside down and i like to use it right out of the shower.</li>
    <li> I cycle and this helps with some of the saddle sore problems and shaving rashes.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works well for getting rid of acne on my back. Just have to keep up with it!</li>
    <li> It works fast since the very first time I used it I loved it and it is also very affordable.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my body acne</li>
    <li> Leave a sticky film on your body and it smells like floor cleaner. I think it helped my body acne though.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a change and the bottle is nearly empty.  The sprayer is great, I have bought body acne spray bottles that do not spray well, and this one does, but I have not noticed that this spray has helped clear anything up on my back.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  it works quickly. I would definitely purchase this again...and I have.</li>
    <li> works great! delivery was very fast</li>
    <li> With Acne on my back it is hard to reach and with this spray it makes that much easier to reach. Feels a little sticky but goes away after a while.</li>
    <li> The spray I got has not box and cap, and some liquid has spilled out. So I am not sure it is brand new or someone has used it before.</li>
    <li> I read lukewarm reviews but with any product dealing with hormones and body chemistry, it depends on the person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far the spray, tablets and Body wash is working for me. I had a sever breakout on my back months ago. I&#x27;m happy!!!!</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, non-sticky, non-staining spray.  I keep it in my gym locker...apply after shower and it dries fairly quickly</li>
    <li> For the price, there are much better options.  I was hoping for some good news using this product, but it actually didn&#x27;t improve and got worse.  I switched to another product and it seems to work much better.</li>
    <li> Works great on backacne but bottle doesnt last, so it can get expensive to be re-ordering ever 2 weeks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with embarrassing body acne on and off since I was 15. I&#x27;ve tried countless body washes, creams, and lotions, and nothing has worked as well as this. It&#x27;s easy to use, it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, and my skin is clearer than it&#x27;s been in a long time. It&#x27;s even started to heal the current breakouts I have, and with hope my skin should be completely clear in a few weeks. I just wish I had found this sooner. I will be re-purchasing.</li>
    <li> Been using daily for a month and still no difference.  I have 2 bottles and will continue to use until they are finished,as this was the most recommended product on the web.</li>
    <li> The spray got those deep black heads out. Plus, left my face feeling really clean afterwards. Easy to use and clean up.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at ALL!!!!! :(</li>
    <li> i have really bad cystic acne on mt back. ive been using it for about a week and ive noticed the cyst are going away slowly and the scares as well. the only think is that i bought 2 bottles and im on my second one already. but it does work</li>
    <li> my son is using this with the pill/crème and it seems to be helping his acne</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m afraid my skin was too sensitive for this, It dried me out. I gave it to my daughter to try.</li>
    <li> It works if you stick with it.  Also, the smell is nice.  It does spray at any angle.  If it doesn&#x27;t then clean the hole.</li>
    <li> I have trouble with adult acne and this is definitely helping, especially on my chest. Have someone help spray your entire back so you get a good even spray and don&#x27;t waste product trying to spray in five directions while reaching over a shoulder. If you don&#x27;t have someone, try to get far away from your skin and spray a large area so you don&#x27;t get too much in one spot. It really has helped with even small tiny clogged pores on the chest. I don&#x27;t get huge pimples mostly, just small acne, so I can&#x27;t speak for people that get bad deep zits.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my chest acne.. maybe it would work for someone else?</li>
    <li> This actually works for me without drying my skin.</li>
