      <li>Interesting smell.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
      <li>And, by the way, kids are the best critics and every day several of the kids in my kindergarten class</li>
      <li>My favorite work day scent.</li>
      <li>The bottle itself is prettily designed, with a good strong sprayer that creates a nice mist.  </li>
      <li>Very unique.</li>
      <li>Nice, light, kind of sweet smell that lots of people compliment on...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the sorta of smell that reminds me of home, curled up under a blanket with a good book and a hot cup of tea.</li>
      <li>It IS very sweet - literally.  </li>
      <li>Smells very very sweet.</li>
      <li>It is lovely, light and whenever I wear it I always get tons of complements.</li>
      <li>The scent is sweet to start, without being too cloying, and leaves the skin smelling warm and rich.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so unique, which I love.</li>
      <li>Lovely fresh, warm, sweet fragrance--it really is very much like warm milk and honey, and</li>
      <li>Strong, long-lasting eau de parfum (EDP).</li>
      <li>This is my absolute  favorite perfume!</li>
      <li>I imagine that I already have my own sweet scent and this just blends right in.</li>
      <li>The honey is the most powerful scent in there, I think, followed up by the violets and then vanilla.&lt;br</li>
      <li>For now, I&#x27;ll be happy when this scent is back in hand!</li>
      <li>a more unique scent than standard dept store fair.</li>
      <li>The perfume was fine, and the bottle was full.</li>
      <li>I originally purchased this at Anthropologie, but could no longer find it there.  </li>
      <li>Imagine a cup of rich vanilla custard flavored with honey and sandalwood &amp; jasmine extracts, topped with chocolate sauce and decorated with edible candied violet petals.</li>
      <li>I purchased Honey and the Moon after reading all the positive reviews since I love sweet perfumes.</li>
      <li>It is my absolute favorite.</li>
      <li>When you want to smell sweet and tantalizing but not cloying, try Honey and the Moon.</li>
      <li>It was too sweet for me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll stick to Tainted Love since it&#x27;s a much lighter, sweeter scent.</li>
      <li>honey and the moon is sweet.</li>
      <li>If you like the smell of sweet, almost fruit like honey</li>
      <li>The closest description to which I can come is burnt sugar and lemon, which sounds really weird, but both my daughter and I, who don&#x27;t agree on most scents, do agree that it is quite nice, and wearing it makes me feel happy.  </li>
      <li>quick ship THX</li>
      <li>This is such a delicious fragrance but not easy to find in many retail establishments.  </li>
      <li>it is a very sweet yet sexy scent, i can&#x27;t get enough of it.</li>
      <li>Tokyo Milk is my new favorite thing.</li>
      <li>This is definitely my new favorite perfum.</li>
      <li>It smells so sweet, of sugar &amp; honey, with just the right hint of flowers and it lasts for hours.</li>
      <li>I have the Salted Carmel lip gloss and is very yummie and works nice on the lips to keep soft..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s warm, it&#x27;s fresh, it&#x27;s different...</li>
      <li>Honey and the Moon is a very warm, sweet, slightly raw fragrance.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this scent! It is lovely, light and whenever I wear it I always get tons of complements. I have very sensitive skin and this perfume causes me no problems at all. Great buy</li>
    <li> Such a unique, not too sweet scent. I absolutely love this perfume!  I always receive compliments when wearing Honey &amp; the Moon!</li>
    <li> I am an ANGEL wearer and love scents that stream musk and vanilla, patchouli and jasmine, chocolate and sandalwood and LAST LONG. This little Tokyo Milk is now my WEAR IT FOR ME perfume...one spritz lasts all day and makes me happy every time I get a gentle whiff of it.</li>
    <li> Love all Toyko Milk products. Even though this parfum wasn&#x27;t quite the fragrance I wanted (my error), it&#x27;s still  delightful. Very unique. Have received numerous compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> Interesting smell. A little bit like baby powder, but not much. I personally think that many perfumes have a scent of baby powder. It was too sweet for me. A little too much honey and not enough sandalwood. I ended up giving it away to a friend. I prefer to use Wild Berry&#x27;s Incense Oil as perfume.</li>
    <li> It is probably the most comforting scent I have. I use if for anxiety and to help me go to sleep or just when I need a little pick me up. Highly recommended, as are the Toyko Milk, Toyko Milk Dark, and Love and Toast - all by same designer.</li>
    <li> I was hoping the perfume would be as good as the candle, I sniff the candle at night and in the morning just to enjoy the glorious scent of vanilla, chocolate, and woodsy combination. I am not sure I will get it again, I might just stick with the candles, but I will be trying their other scents.</li>
    <li> Likely the sandalwood in this cuts what might be an overpowering sweetness.  Infact, it has a distant and faint bitterness that makes it one of my favorite Tokyo Milks.  If you&#x27;ve smelled Victoria&#x27;s Secret&#x27;s Warm and Cozy Pink, this reminded me of that scent at first.  But there is an unusual quality that makes me smell myself over and over...could be the potency.  This scent lingers long after one or two sprays, on me, on my clothes, etc.  Luckily it smells delicious!</li>
    <li> Strong, long-lasting eau de parfum (EDP). Powerful top notes of sugared violets that gives way to Tupelo honey and chocolate, drying down to heavy vanilla, jasmine and sandalwood. Imagine a cup of rich vanilla custard flavored with honey and sandalwood &amp; jasmine extracts, topped with chocolate sauce and decorated with edible candied violet petals. If you love intense gourmand perfumes, you will love this - people all around you might chase after you with a spoon due to its massive sillage! Two spritzes will do, otherwise this EDP will be cloying and choking. If you&#x27;re a fan of subtle, unisex or citrus, this one is definitely not for you. Full-on, foody, feminine and romantic. A fall/winter scent, no doubt, as it&#x27;s too heavy for spring/summer.</li>
    <li> Terrible scent. Under the impression that the scent would have been close to the scent that the soap with the same marketed packaging had. IT IS NOT.</li>
    <li> Perfect scent for any season. It&#x27;s the sorta of smell that reminds me of home, curled up under a blanket with a good book and a hot cup of tea.</li>
    <li> As i opened the package, i expected to find a whisper light sweet/floral smelling perfume.  Instead i got an old lady, powder-ish smelling perfume with waaay too much musk.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best \\&quot;honey\\&quot; scents that I&#x27;ve found. It smells so sweet, of sugar &amp; honey, with just the right hint of flowers and it lasts for hours.</li>
    <li> I have not sampled any other products from Tokyo Milk, but this perfume is so wonderful that I will definitely make the opportunity to try their other fragrances.  I get compliments everytime I wear it.</li>
    <li> I read so many great reviews on this perfume that I had to buy it.  I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I received it yesterday and sprayed it on my wrist and thought this is gonna be so yummy.  Put it on this morning before I went to work and smelled it on me all day.  I felt warm and relaxed.  I basically just smelled honey and sandalwood. But it smells so good..Try it...u won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been hunting for a really good honey fragrance for quite awhile. I had this one on my wishlist for a little over a year while I tried to decide if I wanted to risk spending thirty bucks on a fragrance I couldn&#x27;t test first. I finally decided to risk it and I&#x27;m glad I did. The scent is sweet to start, without being too cloying, and leaves the skin smelling warm and rich. The only thing preventing me from really falling in love with this and giving it a full five stars is the fact that I would have preferred a stronger honey note. Otherwise though, this is a really lovely slightly floral honey scent.</li>
    <li> so good.  i love love love it.  one of the only perfumes i will wear.</li>
    <li> i will never not have this on my birthday and christmas lists!</li>
    <li> Best smelling perfume I&#x27;ve found in years! The price is extremely reasonable!</li>
    <li> This is definitely my new favorite perfum. The first time I smelled it I was a little taken aback at how strongly it smelled like honey but by the next day I was in love with it. I started to smell the other notes in it, specifically the sandalwood which balances out the immediate sweetness of the honey. It&#x27;s so unique, which I love. I&#x27;ve read reviews that say this perfum doesn&#x27;t last but that&#x27;s not true. I work nine hours a day at a preschool where I wash my hands countless times and I can still smell Honey and the Moon on my wrists at the end of the day. And, by the way, kids are the best critics and every day several of the kids in my kindergarten class tell me my arms smell good! :) I would recommend this perfume to anybody!</li>
    <li> This is such a delicious fragrance but not easy to find in many retail establishments.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon and at a great price as well.</li>
    <li> Tokyo Milk is my new favorite thing. My other perfumes have paled completely in comparison - they smell harsh and sharp and everything I try of Tokyo Milk is soft, delicate, and sophisticated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honey and the Moon isn&#x27;t as powerful to me as other people have said. It smells very natural, sweet, and only slightly floral to me. The honey is the most powerful scent in there, I think, followed up by the violets and then vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s interesting how differently scents react with people&#x27;s body chemistry. For reference, I&#x27;m a pscatarian who doesn&#x27;t drink coffee or soda and eats mostly fruits and veggies. I imagine that I already have my own sweet scent and this just blends right in.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s warm, it&#x27;s fresh, it&#x27;s different... I originally purchased this at Anthropologie, but could no longer find it there.  I immediately hunted it down on amazon.com.  It was just a delightful as I remember.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume, I was happy to find it on Amazon and it still be true to scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve smelled this in a store before and I would have thought it was slightly sweeter and less floral but it still smells great and unwound probably buy again</li>
    <li> The perfume was fine, and the bottle was full. However, there is a label on the bottle that states it is a tester. I am not sure I would have purchased it if I had that information, and the price for brand new one is only a couple of dollars different.</li>
    <li> I got this for my birthday and it smells SO good! I keep bees as a hobby and they fly around and land on me a lot more when I wear this.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re allergic to bees, you might not want to buy this but otherwise, GO FOR IT.</li>
    <li> she loves it. a more unique scent than standard dept store fair. Maybe a little sweeter than we&#x27;d hoped but it&#x27;s good.  All Tokyo Milk products seem to impress.</li>
    <li> Bought this before in a store and it was just as expected.</li>
    <li> I want to like it but it smells too musky to me for some reason.</li>
    <li> Product arrived without a box, just in a bubble-wrap bag, leaking slightly, the lid loose and the sticker around the lid not really stuck down.  I hadn&#x27;t smelled Tokyomilk Honey and The Moon before.  I&#x27;m assuming I still haven&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I had sampled this scent in a neighboring town and really liked it. A little goes a long way, so it will last for quite awhile. It is unusual for me to be able to wear scent - usually gives me a headache - so I use just a bit. Good quality for the money!</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Tokyo Milk fragrances and this one is no different. When you want to smell sweet and tantalizing but not cloying, try Honey and the Moon. It drives my man wild!</li>
    <li> This is one of the most beautiful frangrances I have ever found. The blend of honey and flowers has a \\&quot;smoky\\&quot; and sultry effect, and reminds me of entering into a beautifully fragranced hookah bar. Lasts a long time- two sprays are enough to last the whole day (if you spray more, it can become too overwhelming!). Great alternative to L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s discontinued \\&quot;Honey\\&quot; and \\&quot;Honey and Lemon\\&quot; line. If you like this, you will also love TokyoMilk&#x27;s Honey Handcream.</li>
    <li> If you like the smell of sweet, almost fruit like honey then you will love the smell of this perfume.</li>
    <li> Okay, what kind of perfume do I like? The kind that does not make me smell like a department store--you know, that generic cold floral \\&quot;bought at the perfume counter\\&quot; smell, right? Could be anything but you know it&#x27;s \\&quot;perfume.\\&quot; This is not department store smelling perfume.  Honey and the Moon is a very warm, sweet, slightly raw fragrance. The closest description to which I can come is burnt sugar and lemon, which sounds really weird, but both my daughter and I, who don&#x27;t agree on most scents, do agree that it is quite nice, and wearing it makes me feel happy.  When I first tried it on my skin, though, I was not sure that I liked it--it seemed to have a unblended edge to its overall sweetness that bothered me . . . and could I really wear something that sweet?--but I kept walking around, compulsively smelling the spot that I had sprayed, over and over, until I felt sure that I wanted to try it. Three bottles later, I haven&#x27;t been sorry.  It is not long-lasting, but then I do not find scents in this price range to last long in general. The bottle is small enough to fit in my purse or gym bag, after all. My second favorite Tokyo Milk scent has been \\&quot;Sparrow,\\&quot; but I am ordering others to try--I&#x27;ll update this review later, when I have others to compare against. For now, I&#x27;ll be happy when this scent is back in hand!</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume a couple years back. When I found it on Amazon, I was thrilled. The scent is unusual and very  distinct.Has a very calming effect when it is worn</li>
    <li> honey and the moon is sweet. it starts off strong but not overpowering but fades to a subtle sweet sugary scent that is delectable. perfect for all seasons. it is a very sweet yet sexy scent, i can&#x27;t get enough of it. definitely my signature perfume. the packaging is also so adorable. i am excited to try more tokyomilk products in the future.</li>
    <li> Amazing scent, light sultry, with a hint of beeswax and honey.  My favorite work day scent.</li>
    <li> The tokyo milk fragrances are high quality and last a long time. I will say I ordered this scent without trying it, and I do not care for it. It smells very strong of honey, and not like I envisioned it would smell based on the description. It is a quality fragrance, just not my cup of tea.</li>
    <li> You know how you can tell a scent is a quality scent ...it smells natural not fake? Well this is that, but I just didn&#x27;t happen to like the scent. It has a very sharp, strong flowery, honey scent. It might be perfect for someone, but not me.</li>
    <li> This is a very warm and comforting scent, although a tad strong. If I wear it on my neck I definitely need about an hour to adjust to the scent, which is more powerful than the others I wear. It does last all day which is a plus, and the scent is unique.</li>
    <li> Love this ,wish tjey made a larger bottle. The perfume needs to be refreshed tthroughout the day, or evening.  Smells wonderful with white floral perfumes,  layering.</li>
    <li> Lovely fresh, warm, sweet fragrance--it really is very much like warm milk and honey, and I swear there&#x27;s even the tiniest scent of honeycomb wax as well.  It&#x27;s not so dramatic or sultry that I can&#x27;t just wear it every day.  The bottle itself is prettily designed, with a good strong sprayer that creates a nice mist.  That may sound like an odd factor, but there&#x27;s nothing more frustrating than a weak or easily clogged sprayer that won&#x27;t spray or which spits out just a few drops.</li>
    <li> Smells good. Not too heavy, not too light. The only thing is the top is a little loose and I keep having to screw it back on.</li>
    <li> It just makes you want to swoon.  I&#x27;m into my third bottle. Everybody loves it. It IS very sweet - literally.  Love Tokyo Milk.  Nice quality  inventive packaging  quick ship THX</li>
    <li> I purchased Honey and the Moon after reading all the positive reviews since I love sweet perfumes. The bottle is cute with the little bumble bee, but the scent itself is a little overpowering for me. The jasmine and violet almost suffocate me for the first half hour or so, and the sweet honey fades way too fast for my liking. I&#x27;ll stick to Tainted Love since it&#x27;s a much lighter, sweeter scent.</li>
    <li> I love this scent! It is my absolute favorite. What a great name too.</li>
    <li> The perfume inside the bottle is not the real thing. It smells of alcohol and nothing more.</li>
    <li> Smells very very sweet.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute  favorite perfume! Nice, light, kind of sweet smell that lots of people compliment on...plus this is a great price for it!</li>
    <li> Received my Tokoyo Milk bottle of Honey and the Moon perfume today and arrived fast,so happy about that. The perfume is just as promoised a sweet honey scent with good staying power..Will be buying more scents from this brand as tried a couple in the black bottles in a shop but did not buy at time and regretted..so happy that can get on Amazon..I have the Salted Carmel lip gloss and is very yummie and works nice on the lips to keep soft..really a glorified vasoline with scent and flavor but still very happy with.Was in a Honey mood so bought some other products (different brand) a honey scent  body butter and salt scrub also from Amazon, all arrived at same time .Very happy with my choice !</li>
