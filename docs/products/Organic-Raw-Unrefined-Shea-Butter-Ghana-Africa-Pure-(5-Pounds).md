      <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with my order of shea butter, it has that wonderful rawness and purity of earthy organic nature that I&#x27;ve come to appreciate over the years, I ordered from this company for the first time, and will definitely order from them again.</li>

      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good about this.</li>
      <li>I make my own natural skin care products, and this has quite a lot of sediment in it.</li>
      <li>I should have done a little more research before purchasing something that seemed too good to be true, because it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, I didn&#x27;t like the way it went on, it didn&#x27;t feel like it absorbed as fast and felt more chunky</li>
      <li>I was extremely pleased when I received my package and upon opening my package I decided to weigh the shea butter to ensure that I received all 5 lbs and sure enough, it was 5 lbs on the dot!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have so much of this amazing product...I won&#x27;t need any for a while. Fast service. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I used it to make a shea body butter.  It was amazing!!!</li>
    <li> Just as described. I filtered the Shea myself, very easy to do. Great product and quick shipping. I even weighed the product when it arrives at it was spot on.</li>
    <li> good price will buy again</li>
    <li> I use this shea butter in my organic body care products. It has a lovely consistency and melts nicely into my oils, beeswax, and cocoa butter to make very nice salves.</li>
    <li> Iwill be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> Very good shea butter. I like the white refine butter better, but this is good and would buy again. great!</li>
    <li> too messy and can&#x27;t get off your clothes.</li>
    <li> Wonderful quality and great for making skin and hair mixes. Its easy to work with and the quantity is great.</li>
    <li> I placed my order on January 16th and received my order today!  Talk about fast shipping! I was extremely pleased when I received my package and upon opening my package I decided to weigh the shea butter to ensure that I received all 5 lbs and sure enough, it was 5 lbs on the dot! After opening the box I inspected the product and tried a little bit on my hand and it felt just like BUTTER! (pun intended) :-) I had my friend try it out on her hand she was very pleased with the consistancy and how fast the shea butter melted into her skin.  I&#x27;ve seen a few of the reviews where people have stated they were not pleased with the packaging, my shea butter came in a heavy plastic bag with another plastic bag around it and I don&#x27;t have any complaints about my packaging as I will simply transfer this into another container...there are certain things just not worth complaining about.  I will begin to make my lotions and hair moisterizers this weekend and I will come back with another review on how the product held up during this process, but as my subject line states...so far, so good I am pleased with my experience with the company, the shipping, and the product.  Nothing but positive things from this consumer!</li>
    <li> This is amazing shea butter. It hardly leaves any greasy feeling and absorbs much better than the other raw unrefined shea butters I have used. I highly recommend this for lotions and salves. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shea butter I have ever used. It is of great quality and you get so much of it. This was money well spent. It took a while to receive it but it was worth the wait.  I would without a doubt recommend this.</li>
    <li> Great value.  A bit surprised by the need to cook it, but it was very simple and turned out great. Love this Shea Butter!</li>
    <li> Organic Raw Unrefined Shea Butter Ghana Africa Pure (5 Pounds) . MY MOM LOVES IT, THAT IS ALL THAT MATTERS!!</li>
    <li> Very creamy like butter..and it last a long time!!! I LOVE IT!! It makes my skin very smooth and soft!</li>
    <li> I would have liked the product in a container rather than a bag......Other than that... I am happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I like the product but I wish there was not added dye in it.  I would make whip shea butter, hair shea butter conditioner, shea butter hair cream.</li>
    <li> 5 star because it was the product that I wanted when it arrived! I&#x27;ve had both Shea Butter and what they call African butter before and I believe this is African butter. Is Ghane African butter pure unrefined shea butter? No matter this is what I wanted and I use it every day in my hair and on my face it&#x27;s the greatest stuff in the world. I work outside in the weather of Minnesota. 5# goes a long way and it&#x27;s inexpensive.  jr.</li>
    <li> this supplier is great. I was surprise how fast I got it. this is my second time using this supplier and the price was great too. the way my husband bathe in it we will be ordering again soon</li>
    <li> i use this everyday.  i absolutely love the shea butter, I&#x27;ve stopped using lotions and body butter. I use it all over, and it helps make my skin silky smooth.</li>
    <li> This arrived on time and was a huge amount - the trick is to find a way to store it. At $10 it is a bargain. It can be melted and mixed with fragrance or added to other ingredients such as liquid DMSO.</li>
    <li> High quality! Rich colour! It was shipped out fast. The only thing that could make it better if it was shipped out in plastic containers with tight  lids when purchased in large bulk.</li>
    <li> This is all that I use on my body and my daughter. Last year my daughter skin had so many marks from dryness and from constant itching due to the heat in the summer and the only thing that soothed her skin was the Shea butter that I applied, from that period on I&#x27;ve been using it and all the marks have vanished....This size would last at least 6months...</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best. Great product....received promptly....great!!!!!!</li>
    <li> way more than I needed, but a good product</li>
    <li> I use this in a lot of things, lotions, conditioner, butters, soaps, etc. Amazing stuff. This came in one nice big block, instead of bits and crumbs like other places I&#x27;ve gotten it, which makes it much easier for me to handle.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for with a decent price...</li>
    <li> I was very happy to recieve my 5lb bag of shea butter. It was in a simple plastic bag closed tightly and inside a box. It is yellow and smells like cocoa butter but a bit different like family of cocoa. Applied straight on the skin and its not even greasy. I mixed it with olive oil as a medicinal for skin. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t get this again, even after following directions and cleaning it the bright yellow stains everything after application so I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, not well packed. The product is excellent try to invest more time in the packing. Seal the butter in a very tide plastic bag and avoid the butter to be contaminated in transit with bugs.</li>
    <li> I love this shea butter.  It is clean and priced great.  I love working with butter to make my home made body butters. Love it</li>
    <li> This shea butter is lightly scented and dissolves rapidly into the skin immediately relieving winter dryness. I will definitely purchase more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with my order of shea butter, it has that wonderful rawness and purity of earthy organic nature that I&#x27;ve come to appreciate over the years, I ordered from this company for the first time, and will definitely order from them again. Thanks !&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This product is the REAL DEAL! I LOVE it. It is Shea Butter at it&#x27;s best. BUY THIS PRODUCT! You&#x27;ll be glad you did! PEACE!</li>
    <li> Great!  Came exactly as noted in description.</li>
    <li> The shea butter itself is amazing! I whip it with coconut oil, vanilla &amp; rosemary.  It is great!  However i ordered5 pounds abs only recieved 4.15 when i told the company they argued with me for 2 days before finalky sending out the extra pound.  But at least it is fixed now</li>
    <li> The 5 lbs of raw unrefined Shea butter took a little longer to arrive at my house than stated. Also it never said on the site it would need to be filtered at my home by me once I received it. I have never had to filter a product I bought before and it not letting me know this I feel is misleading because I would not have purchased this product knowing I have to melt down and filter 5 lbs of Shea butter. I would have been able to buy the correct Shea butter for my needs. Also it is a very dark yellow which also was never stated on the site. I will say however they have been great in emailing me back about how to filter the Shea butter but, with very limited directions. No real directions at all on what temperature the butter should reach when heated before it has to be filtered through a clothe etc, and things like this. I hope to work this out with them more through email communications as I would like to order from then again as they have great prices.</li>
    <li> The quality of this shea is not as high as I was hoping for. I make my own natural skin care products, and this has quite a lot of sediment in it. I have chosen to purchase a diferent brand from now on because of this. If this doesn&#x27;t bother you, then this shea will serve it&#x27;s purpose. Good luck!</li>
    <li> love it i have been using this for about 3 years now and my friend gave me the website to order. I used to buy it locally here. thanks</li>
    <li> Beautiful creamy unrefined Shea butter. I use this in my soaps and on my face. I can&#x27;t say enough good about this.</li>
    <li> I was happy with the quality, but it definitely was not 5lbs, I would hope this was an honest mistake and not intentional. But none the less I feel cheated. My scale won&#x27;t register for under 5 lbs. I tried weighing it at least six times. I then weighed myself and again holding the product. I did this 3 times for accuracy as well and it turns out, I was sent 2.9 pounds of product. So if the seller would rectify the mistake I would greatly appreciate it. I love the product, just not that I only received half.</li>
    <li> I have used organic raw shea butter for years and and I recently bought from A different supplier,  , the quality is superb it don&#x27;t get any better than this. It  helps fade away scars and helps A great deal with muscle pain and its A great skin moisturizer .I use it daily</li>
    <li> It worked out great for me melted it down to make whipped shea butter to give out as gifts. It was a hit!!! I will be ordering more!!</li>
    <li> It smells great and feels great and you get a ton of it. So now I can make my own lotions with the base of shea. The only thing I warn about is that the color is a bit strong. It caught me by surpise at first by itself. It looked like I put spray on tan all over my face. I&#x27;m sure itll tone down a bit when I get it mixed up with a few other things. Maybe next time ill try you whiter kind.</li>
    <li> WE LOVE IT! It&#x27;s so soft and creamy and it dissolves on the skin well -it&#x27;s not too greasy. Enclosed in a US Priority Mail box, the shea butter arrived wrapped in a clear trash bag (great way to keep the cost of the shea butter down). We WILL reorder from this company again!</li>
    <li> I love the organic raw unrefined shea butter Shana Africa I receive from Legends of Africa.  This is about the sixth time I&#x27;ve ordered from this company.  The shea butter arrives on or before the date indicated on the invoice and is always fresh and easy to work with.  One time I had a question and contacted the company.  The response was immediate and friendly.  I plan on continuing to receive my shea butter from Legends of Africa.&lt;br /&gt;~anita</li>
    <li> Y is this shea butter feal greasy and smell bitter. Iv bin having problems every time i buy bulk. Whats going on??</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Will purchase again in future.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of shea butter, especially in the winter, and have tried a lot of different kinds on Amazon.  I bought this one because it was such a large amount and it was a very good price.  It still moisturized like normal but it felt differently, I didn&#x27;t like the way it went on, it didn&#x27;t feel like it absorbed as fast and felt more chunky (it didn&#x27;t smooth over well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also had a very distinct yellow color.  I know shea butter is typically yellowish but this was the brightest yellow I&#x27;ve seen  and when putting it on it visibly made my skin yellow.  Thus, I did not put this stuff on my face.  After it absorbed my skin went back to its regular color but it is very noticeable at first.  It also turned the fabric that touched it yellow too.  It washes out but it is very unappealing to have your skin and clothes turn yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had also split this with a friend and she noticed the same thing.  It is a great price and it does moisturize but I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this shea better. Great product, easy to work with and just a faint smell but pleasant.</li>
    <li> I love this shea butter.  It&#x27;s the real deal and works very well, and such good quality and quantity for what I paid.  I recently started making  homemade products and it&#x27;s so much better then what I would have bought at the stores.</li>
    <li> You cannot go wrong with African Shea Butter for your skin. It is in all the products today! Great bargain, too!</li>
    <li> I should have done a little more research before purchasing something that seemed too good to be true, because it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is NOT shea butter, it&#x27;s African butter, which is a completely different product which comes from a completely different tree. It is similar to shea butter in its moisturizing abilities, but it smells nothing like shea butter and looks nothing like pure shea. It has a very unpleasant smell, I&#x27;m told you can get used to it but I haven&#x27;t yet. Shea butter is supposed to smell sweet and slightly nutty, this product smells kind of like old playdough and dirt, which is surprising to me considering the company is entitled &amp;#34;Smellgood&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in a plastic bag full of lumpy yellow mush-nuggets. Not appealing. It will be very hard to keep fresh without a real container. There is also some debris, which I suppose is to be expected when purchasing a raw product, but God knows what the little black flakes are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from my disappointment I was able to make a nice whipped body butter, but no matter how much essential oil I added, I could NOT get rid of the smell, even though this African butter was only one of the three different base oils I used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To end my rant (sorry), if you&#x27;re looking to buy shea butter, do NOT buy this product. If you don&#x27;t care what it actually is, go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: you get what you pay for. I wish I had just paid more for the real thing.</li>
    <li> Came on time! Wasn&#x27;t well packaged but it didn&#x27;t bother me. A lot for the price I paid as well. Great on my skin and in my hair! Will be ordering from you all again in the near future!!</li>
    <li> Amazing, this product arrived ahead of time, and was just what I was looking for.  The quality of the shea butter was very good.  I have skin conditions and so does my daughter so shea butter is fabulous for hair and skin.  Is easy to use and inexpensive.  For all you youtubers this is a great deal, order your shea butter from Legends of Africa!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Valen Ford, M.Ed.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel this works as well as some shea butter I have ordered from ebay, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well with my skin. There are some hard clumps in it and the package did not say anything about it being organic. I had an old plastic container where I had bought some from ebay and the labels on both were identical except that this one did not say organic, so I am assuming it is not, which is what I paid for. I very much want to put organic products on my skin while I am pregnant, so I&#x27;m not sure I got to do that! It isn&#x27;t as smooth as a lot of other raw shea butters I have used and takes a lot longer to spread on my skin. It keeps me moisturized, but isn&#x27;t comfortable to put on. Next time I will be ordering from ebay again, I feel I can trust their distributors better than this one.</li>
    <li> I purchased 5lbs of Organic Raw Unrefined African Golden Shea Butter. It&#x27;s a great product. Has so many healing properties. I will be purchasing again. Thank you. ;-)</li>
    <li> I love it! Id like it to be packaged differently but other than that, AWESOME!</li>
