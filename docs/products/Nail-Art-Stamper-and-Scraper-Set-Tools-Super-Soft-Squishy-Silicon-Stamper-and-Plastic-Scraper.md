      <li>Love this so much fun and does great!</li>
      <li>This Set is nice, I like the Flower</li>
      <li>but I wasn&#x27;t able to see good the polish being scraped.  </li>
      <li>The rubber pieces fall out of the holder very easily.</li>
      <li>Best stamp set so far.  </li>
      <li>They cleaned up really easily and held up well!</li>
      <li>Great product, exactly as described will buy from again and recommend</li>
      <li>its ok</li>
      <li>Cute and better quality then</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s with most stamps.</li>
      <li>ok.</li>
      <li>I love using nail art.</li>
      <li>I love them...</li>
      <li>so it picks up the nail polish better and transfers better.</li>
      <li>I also prefer the scraper to the razor, it works much better.</li>
      <li>So the quality on my purchase personally was not the best.</li>
      <li>A very speedy transaction, great quality stampers and I love the plastic scraper because I don&#x27;t like scratching my plates.</li>
      <li>Stamp seems to lift images rather well for the most part.  </li>
      <li>I love love this scraper...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>Make sure that you buff the stampers after every stamp.</li>
      <li>Also I put a nickel inside the top of the holder to keep the stamper head from falling out..  </li>
      <li>Love the plastic card though.  </li>
      <li>I used a &amp;#34;magic eraser&amp;#34; to remove the sticky, greasy film on the top of the stamper head.  </li>
      <li>Which type of tape do I use on the top of said stampers?</li>
      <li>Might need to be primed a bit more.  </li>
      <li>But would love it if you could ship the scrapers</li>
      <li>The set comes with a metal scraper and a plastic one (which i&#x27;ve read is better because it doesn&#x27;t damage the plates).</li>
      <li>but they were soft and squishy and picked up the full images perfectly.  </li>
      <li>The package came very fast and in good condition.</li>
      <li>Pretty good.</li>
      <li>However, after some trial and error on priming, it turned out pretty good.  </li>
      <li>The way I did it because I didn&#x27;t want to buy a magic eraser, I just used a fine grit nail file.</li>
      <li>These are pretty good stampers, but not as squishy as the description makes it sound.  </li>
      <li>and I loved it so much</li>
      <li>I got the stamper because I like doing my own nails and can do a lot from tutorials, but I always have the biggest problem doing my right hand</li>
      <li>but I could easily just use a plastic card.</li>
      <li>You can easily remove the leftover polish from the stamping head by pressing it onto a sticky lint roller.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, they work perfectly fine.</li>
      <li>works fine</li>
      <li>I primed mine with a knock off Magic Eraser to get the shine off, and it stamps perfectly first try!</li>
      <li>This is a lot of fun, we love to play with nail stencils.</li>
      <li>A solid color would have been better for visibility in scraping, otherwise good purchase for the price.</li>
      <li>I had planned on using an old debit card but this one is a really good size and shape...</li>
      <li>threw these out after purchasing a Konad set (and new discs) and finally got a perfect result!</li>
      <li>SO WORTH IT!</li>
      <li>Take a nail file and buff it until it is no longer shiney and take a lint roller to clean it, even after stamping do not use polish remover on it.</li>
      <li>I ordered it for a special occasion</li>
      <li>I still can&#x27;t get it to pick up the FULL IMAGE..</li>
      <li>Nice and soft..</li>
      <li>The bigger stamper is good.  </li>
      <li>it did come quickly and scraper works</li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>The set is cheap, so I don&#x27;t really mind.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i received this item not complete,</li>
    <li> The plastic scraper was ideal and after priming the stampers both worked amazing. Had absolutely no trouble transferring images from plate to my nail. Awesome!</li>
    <li> These are the worst scraper plates ever!!! These left more on the plate then they actually scraped off. Plastic one awful, metal one terrible!</li>
    <li> When I got it I was very happy but the part where the nail polish Is suppose to stick to wasnt even attached to the handle part. And the grey one had a dent in it. So the quality on my purchase personally was not the best. Would I recommend this? No. Its pretty and all but not worth it.</li>
    <li> These are pretty good stampers, but not as squishy as the description makes it sound.  I knocked off a star for that.  If you&#x27;re looking for a medium-ish stamper on the smaller side these might work well for you.</li>
    <li> I got this stamper kit because the one I had ordered before didn&#x27;t seem to work all that great, but this one is sooo much better. It seems to be tackier so it picks up the nail polish better and transfers better. I also prefer the scraper to the razor, it works much better. I got the stamper because I like doing my own nails and can do a lot from tutorials, but I always have the biggest problem doing my right hand, it looks like a kid did it, but with the stamper you can have nail art that looks professional on BOTH hands.</li>
    <li> This is a lot of fun, we love to play with nail stencils.</li>
    <li> Does not stamp I have prime it and it doesn&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know what else to do!!!</li>
    <li> Awful. Neither scraper works. The gray stamper doesn&#x27;t work, and I did not get the white one, only an empty plastic piece.</li>
    <li> stamper wont stamp fustrated</li>
    <li> The scrapers work well, but the stampers are too sticky and do not pick up the image. I am using an old one and that one works better. The pink scraper is a little small for my stamping plate but it generally works well. The Rose one is my favorite, big enough to scrape the entire image. This product is a little overpriced, I think it should be three dollars instead of six.  This is a generally bad set of stampers and scrapers I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Not really impressed. Instead of sending the black one, they could have sent two of the white...</li>
    <li> Does not tranfer ! Very desapoited</li>
    <li> Love this for stamping! I&#x27;m new to it and this is a good starter kit. Just remember to prime your stamper before using otherwise the nail polish won&#x27;t stay on the stamper. The way I did it because I didn&#x27;t want to buy a magic eraser, I just used a fine grit nail file. Worked perfectly. And also after each time to take off the nail polish from the stamper, DON&#x27;T use nail polish remover, just use scotch tape to remove the polish. After using the tape to remove the polish I had to prime it again with the nail file, but it works well! I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> These work well as long as you prep.</li>
    <li> this was shown with a bag to hold all the stuff and it did not arrive with one. The stamper is too soft and I have not gotten it to work yet.</li>
    <li> the scrapers not to crazy about it i use a gift card as a scraper but the stampers are the bomb really great</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. Neither stamper works. It didn&#x27;t come with any instructions other than file and clean. Could have been more specific. I ordered it for a special occasion and it did not arrive on time. Will be asking for a refund. Wish I could give zero stars.</li>
    <li> Could not use this it would not pick up the color and the rubber kept coming out if the base. Had to return it.</li>
    <li> Worst purchase! I have experince with the plates but the rubber does not transfer from the plate... very dissapointing... will be returing</li>
    <li> The rubber on both stampers keeps falling out &amp; I can barely get the grey one to work half the time (dont know why) but other than that, the product works... after a few tries. You just have to wait a couple minutes in-between each stamp because for some reason the stampers dont pick up the nail polish right after you&#x27;ve just used it. I&#x27;ve tried wiping the stampers down with nail polish remover &amp; even with a dry lint free cloth, nothing works. Also, I prefer using the plastic scrapper verses the metal one because it doesn&#x27;t scratch my stamping plates.</li>
    <li> Works great! Make sure that you buff the stampers after every stamp. The floral scraper works awesome! I immediately threw away the metal scraper because I know that it scratches the plates. The package came very fast and in good condition.</li>
    <li> NOT GOOD QUALITY AT ALL.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and it works great!</li>
    <li> Got this item in the mail and the squishy heads were not even attached to their bases. Not happy. Now I have to buy new ones.</li>
    <li> Could not get the stamps to pick up the polish design. Tried filing off the tops and it still wouldn&#x27;t pick anything up.</li>
    <li> Great Works perfect once you get the hang of it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like writing negative reviews, but hopefully this will help someone who is new to nail stamping.&lt;br /&gt;I really didn&#x27;t know much about stamping so I ordered this with a large set of Pueen discs. For some reason I could not get the stamping procedure to work for me. After a little research and more trail and error, I discovered that this stamper and scraper set are just not the quality needed to get a clear stamp on the nail. The scrapper may look like all of the others, but its not &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34; enough and leaves lots of polish behind. Also, the stamper is too soft/squishy, and doesn&#x27;t pick up the polish (yes, I tried filing it as suggested).&lt;br /&gt;I threw these out after purchasing a Konad set (and new discs) and finally got a perfect result!</li>
    <li> Did not work for me would not pick up rubber kept falling out.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Super fast shipping !  Product just as described. Thank you. Will buy from again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really glad I ordered this one because the one I had ordered with my stamp plates came in with a crease in the middle... I love love this scraper... I had planned on using an old debit card but this one is a really good size and shape... it was a good purchase and my Pink bigger stamper is my go to stamper now! (I don&#x27;t use the metal scrapers at all)</li>
    <li> Did not like. The pads are too squishy. I have tried multiple techniques. My daughters also tried. We all have a little different touch, but we had very little luck in picking up the Polish from the stamp template</li>
    <li> Gave me instructions to &amp;#34;file&amp;#34; it down? Really if I do that wouldn&#x27;t the polish stick??</li>
    <li> The stampers are great! Nice and soft.. However, I did not get my complete order.. The scrapers were missing. I will not return.. But would love it if you could ship the scrapers</li>
    <li> Cute and better quality then I expected. Very fun to mess around with</li>
    <li> Best stamp set so far.  Don&#x27;t use the metal scraper.  Love the plastic card though.  And its nice to have a white one and a black one depending on what color polish you are working with.</li>
    <li> I was very frustrated until I read a review for another squishy that said to just touch gently. Pressing hard wasn&#x27;t picking up polish, but the light touch did the trick. The grey is great for white polish.</li>
    <li> Absolutely a waste of time. They literally pick up no polish from the plates. Save your money and spend a few extra bucks on better stamps.</li>
    <li> This is garbage and was a waste of money!!!! Stupid thing does not even pick up the stamps, the stamper keeps coming apart won&#x27;t even stay in place&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money never buying a product from here</li>
    <li> A very speedy transaction, great quality stampers and I love the plastic scraper because I don&#x27;t like scratching my plates. Now I can stop using my credit card to scrape! Will shop with again. Love the grey stamper because I can see my white stamping polish on it so much better than on the white stamper. Both have the soft silicone that allows you to stretch the design over wide or long nails. Tip: use a nail file to go across each stamp to knock off the shine and it will truly help with picking up most polishes outside of the regular stamping polishes.</li>
    <li> Excellent stampers.  If you prime them correctly they are THE BEST.</li>
    <li> I love using nail art. I&#x27;ve always taken good care of my nails and keep them polished at all times. My daughter turned me on to nail art and now I&#x27;m hooked. I needed a good stamper to apply the polish so I bought this set. I realized after a few failed attempts that the surface of the stamper needs to be buffed lightly with a file in order for the stamper to pick up the polish....not a big deal....once I did that it worked terrific. It has a black stamper for light polishes and a pink stamper for darker colors. The set works like a charm and definitely makes my stamping a lot easier. It works awesome and applies the art to my nail perfectly...LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Stampers work great! I filed the stampers with a nail file before I used them. They pick up and transfer nail polish really well. I would have given the product 5 stars, but the scrapers are so-so. I get better results using an old gift card. I have used the stampers on my two daughters once a week since we got it. Great product!</li>
    <li> I love both stampers, especially the gray one.  Both are squishy but not marshmallow.  I would say medium soft.</li>
    <li> These stamps are terrible! After I primed them both, the grey one only picks up part of the design. The white one doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL!  Tried many different polishes and many different designs to no avail. Very disappointed. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Looks to be good... i just received everything but the black rubber piece. I&#x27;m going to return it and buy it again hopefully, it does not come without the piece again..</li>
    <li> The bigger stamper is good.  The smaller one is ok.  Both stampers have to be primed before stamping.  I used a &amp;#34;magic eraser&amp;#34; to remove the sticky, greasy film on the top of the stamper head.  Also I put a nickel inside the top of the holder to keep the stamper head from falling out..  I will not use the metal scraper, I prefer to use a plastic gift card to scrape my plates.  The flowered designed plastic scraper is good but I wasn&#x27;t able to see good the polish being scraped.  A solid color would have been better for visibility in scraping, otherwise good purchase for the price.</li>
    <li> Yes, this is the good one!  The rubber is very soft and the darker rubber on the little stamper makes light polish easy to see and place.</li>
    <li> The only reason why I am not giving this 5 stars is because the rubber heads to the stampers come out quite often. It can easily be fixed with a hot glue gun though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still kinda new to the whole stamping art. I wasn&#x27;t to familiar with all the different stampers (Squsihy), (Firm Squishy), (Rubber) etc.. LOL, I was shocked on the SQUISHINESS of it.. Which type of tape do I use on the top of said stampers? It doesn&#x27;t say.. I still can&#x27;t get it to pick up the FULL IMAGE.. Or when it does it is SMEARED.. THANX FOR ANY HELP 😊😉</li>
    <li> Got these today, got all that is pictured however neither stamper picks up anything at all. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> Purchased for my teenager who loves doing her nails.  She loves this kit.</li>
    <li> works fine but I didn&#x27;t get half of what I ordered</li>
    <li> Love this so much fun and does great!</li>
    <li> the pink scrap is useless neither one of the stampers pick up, i buffed n did everything possible but nothing</li>
    <li> These breaks easily worth investing in more expensive ones.</li>
    <li> Plastic scraper works well. Both stampers come apart sometimes - the rubber stamp comes out of the plastic holder. But they always go back in just fine. I primed them with a nail file, but I&#x27;m not sure if they actually needed it. They stamp really well, but have a tendency to pick up a lot of debris like lint, fibers and such. SO WORTH IT!</li>
    <li> Pink scraper is a waste since I&#x27;m not going to use it. Stamps are great. Must buff surface before but that&#x27;s with most stamps.</li>
    <li> works well don&#x27;t use metal scrapper</li>
    <li> They do not pick up the image at all and I&#x27;m not using any cheap nail polish either....seriously disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love these stampers! They are squishy, which is exactly what I was looking for. With my other stamper I would have to roll on the stamp, but with this one I can press it on my nail and it squishes enough to reach the sides that I don&#x27;t have to roll it! I primed mine with a knock off Magic Eraser to get the shine off, and it stamps perfectly first try! The white head does come out, but it wasn&#x27;t an issue for when I was stamping. You can easily remove the leftover polish from the stamping head by pressing it onto a sticky lint roller. Didn&#x27;t even bother looking at the scrapers, I use an old credit card to scrape.</li>
    <li> This Set is nice, I like the Flower Scraper.&lt;br /&gt;I was really looking forward to the Stamper with the dark silicone.&lt;br /&gt;However, I was disappointed... The surface was uneven.&lt;br /&gt;I hope it doesen&#x27;t make any problems of transfering the patterns. Haven&#x27;t the time to try it yet.</li>
    <li> I got this because of the plastic scraper (the one with the roses) little did I know that I was going to love this purchase, both stamps are great for picking up any art image. I must admit that I had my reservations because the tampers are super soft squishy silicon stamper, I am very happy to say that I love them they work great. A must buy 1st-because its a good product and 2nd-for the price that you can not over look.</li>
    <li> its ok but the stamper fell out a couple of times before i even used it other then that its alright u get exactly what&#x27;s pictured.. ..</li>
    <li> These worked pretty good once I filed them down a bit but every now and then they wouldn&#x27;t pick up nail art stamp polish..</li>
    <li> Barely works, and it keeps falling apart. Really unfortunate, I was excited about this one.</li>
    <li> the scraper wasn&#x27;t that great, but the stampers were amazing! it works so well.</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;m a beginner.  I just began this tonight.  I viewed some YouTube videos and think I&#x27;m a pro ;).  Just thought i should throw that out there.  However, after some trial and error on priming, it turned out pretty good.  My nails look gorgeous.  I would have paid $40 for this at the salon but got it at home for a fraction of the cost thanks to this stamper!  Stamp seems to lift images rather well for the most part.  Might need to be primed a bit more.  Could be the image plate, the stamper, or just plain human error.  Hard to say.  I still feel this is a good buy.  Good beginner stamp.  BTW I have not tried the metal scraper because I heard they scratch plates and I am so flipping OCD about some of these things...</li>
    <li> Great item.Picks up print well.</li>
    <li> Pretty good. My rating is mostly due to the fact that I&#x27;m still trying to get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> I only received one Stamper and Scraper with this order. Otherwise, they work perfectly fine. I only wish I had gotten what was advertised.</li>
    <li> I love them... It does the job, I will buy them again... Great quality!!!</li>
    <li> This was perfect. I used with OPI polish and did not have to prime my stamper. They cleaned up really easily and held up well!</li>
    <li> Great product, exactly as described will buy from again and recommend</li>
    <li> Not sure of the technical terminology, but these are squishy &amp; soft. They pick up well &amp; the gray is my fav for using white polish!</li>
    <li> The stamper itself is not bad, but when I received it, the package was open and all that was in the box was the stamper. I received no accessories or scraper. The photo is very deceiving. Also, the stamper is not very high quality.. the rubber pad has already come unglued and will fall out of the base. Will be purchasing a higher quality version of this product from a different retailer. It is impossible to use the stamp plates without a scraper.</li>
    <li> GREAT PURCHASE!!! LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t pick up anything, didn&#x27;t work for me at least, even when I tried to fix it, it didn&#x27;t work :/ it did come quickly and scraper works</li>
    <li> Not a squishy stamper at all. Returned for my money back.</li>
    <li> I love these stampers! I already had the pink one with the white stamper and I loved it so much I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to get another one and I wanted to grey one for when I stamp with white so I could see it. I actually like the grey one better and it is now my favorite! As for the scrapers I threw away the metal one to prevent scratching my plates but the plastic one is awesome it&#x27;s nice to have an extra. Oh and FYI you HAVE to buff the stampers, when you get them they will be shiney and will not work like that! Take a nail file and buff it until it is no longer shiney and take a lint roller to clean it, even after stamping do not use polish remover on it. After doing this they will work phenomenally so happy stamping!</li>
    <li> The metal scraper doesn&#x27;t work at all. It came bent. The white stamper is hard to work with. Had to file both in order to make them work. The plastic scraper works perfect.. but I could easily just use a plastic card. The set is cheap, so I don&#x27;t really mind. I got what I expected with the money I paid for. edit: After multiple attempts and filing the white stamper, I was able to make it work. This set is perfect for beginners or just someone who doesn&#x27;t want to pay $5 for just one stamper. This includes 2 stampers, a metal scraper, and plastic scraper. Just keep in mind, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me, ended up returning.</li>
    <li> So far I have only used the hot pink stamper and the light pink scraper, love them both. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Both stamps work really well. They are my first nail stampers so i don&#x27;t know how the &amp;#34;squishiness&amp;#34; compares to others but they were soft and squishy and picked up the full images perfectly.  The set comes with a metal scraper and a plastic one (which i&#x27;ve read is better because it doesn&#x27;t damage the plates).</li>
    <li> These work well reasonably enough. It is sometimes difficult to stamp nails straight.</li>
    <li> The rubber pieces fall out of the holder very easily. Don&#x27;t buy. When they don&#x27;t fall apart the white one works ok. The black one won&#x27;t pick up color at all</li>
