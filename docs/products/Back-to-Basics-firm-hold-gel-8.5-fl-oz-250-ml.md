<li> This one was very watery, not very gelled.  </li>

    <li> I enjoy using this gel because it is not at all sticky or too stiff.  It is certainly better than using a mouse which dries out my hair.  Glad I could find it on Amazon........... it&#x27;s not available in the salons or stores I&#x27;ve been to.</li>
    <li> Not the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; back to basics that was thick.  I think this was diluted.  Won&#x27;t order it again.  Ripped off.</li>
    <li> This is suppose to be a gel.  All tubes I ordered were a liquid.  Never had this problem before.  Not happy with effect on hair.</li>
    <li> Without a doubt, this is THE best hair gel EVER!  I have medium-length hair and this gel is the only, only one that allows me to \\&quot;scrunch\\&quot; my hair for a curly look.  I am hopeful that Back to Basics will continue to produce this item and that the seller will continue to offer it!  Service-wise: this was a fantastic transaction; the gel arrived nearly within the blink of an eye; thank you!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, Back to Basics has discontinued it, so this is the second tube I have bought on Amazon.  This one was very watery, not very gelled.  I am very disappointed in this particular tube of gel.</li>
    <li> Mom used to say if i cannot say something good then do not say anything at all.  But I do need to warn anyone else that this product IS NOT Back to Basics texturizing lotion.  How I wish it was because now I have 3 bottles of runny water glue that dries my hair out to a brittle straw.&lt;br /&gt;If anyone else has any influence with Back to Basics....PLEASE bring back the TEXTURIZING LOTION.  It was perfect for my hair, adding thickness and defining gently soft curls.  I have not found anything else like it.  Certainly not the product I just spent over $35 on buying.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the past three or four years and the one I received from you was watered down.  It was a thin and messy liquid.  Feel I was ripped off!</li>
    <li> It is actually liquid in a tube.  You have to be very careful when you open the cap and pour the product into your hand.  You can end up pouring out half the tube.  In addition, it leaves a film in your hair.  I have used Back to Basics products for years for my curly hair and I will find something that I like.  After a few years it is discontinued and I have to search for something else to replace it.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything from this company again.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; had turned to liquid, I suppose from storage in high temperatures. Second time this has happened with this product here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product in the past and had no issues with it.  However, this time the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; arrived with the consistency of soup, and it hasn&#x27;t solidified in the week that I&#x27;ve had it.  I feel like I&#x27;m stuck with it until it runs out, which should be faster because of the consistency.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this product available online. I have used it for years with great success. No longer available in fine salons. Works well with any type of hair. Thanks again.</li>
    <li> This product gives me great body without weight. Great for fine hair. So disappointed that it was discontinued. If you can find it, buy it!</li>
    <li> This is amazing for your hair. I use this every day.  Can only find it online.  Great seller!!! Very happy!</li>
    <li> Wife says she has very fine hair and this gel gives it body. She loves it and uses it all the time. She recommends it to people with fine hair.</li>
    <li> So happy to find this since it is no longer in stores; but it&#x27;s not what it used to be.....much more liquidy and not much hold......disappointed....</li>
    <li> Would not recommend this to anyone!  I ordered two, thinking it was the same gel I get from my stylist.  Bad idea, I could only get a refund for the one that had not been opened, so I am out $14.</li>
    <li> The product inside does not match the packaging. I have purchased this gel from my hair stylist for the past few years and was disappointed when it was discontinued. I was thrilled to find it online, but it was too good to be true.  The consistency is very watery and it provides very little &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34;. Too bad.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years but when these 2 tubes of Back to Basics gel arrived and I went to use it was very watery in consistency.  This has never been the consistency of this product before.  I will not order it again from  this company and wish I could get a refund.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this is unavailable at salons any longer, but this is great for fine hair, to hold a style without holding down my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but I wouldn&#x27;t call it firm hold</li>
